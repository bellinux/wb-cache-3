Study {{results indicate that the}} bit inner diameter is determined by target sampling mass and the density of drilling objects. Outer diameters of the bit and the helical blades are determined by the required power and torque for auger driller's restart from its state buried. To utilize the accommodated capacity of cuttings and dissipating the heat produced by bit during drilling process as much as possible, the lead angle is recommended to be 15 °∼ 20 °. The helical blade width should be obtained after <b>other</b> <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> parameters are determined. Feeding rate should be determined at first, and rotation speed is decided by the auger driller's structure size and feeding rate. Rotational speed will be enough as long as it can satisfy the normal discharge of the cuttings, otherwise its increasing would significantly increase drilling power...|$|E

At 90  years, some scientists have proposed to carry out underground operations by controlling the change in the rotational rate of the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe.</b> Using the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> rotation rate {{as the basis for the}} transfer command, the sensor connected to the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> can measure the rotation rate of the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe.</b> The rotation axis of the sensor is coincident with the rotation axis of the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe.</b> When the rotational speed increases, the centrifugal force increases, in the role of centrifugal force sensor in the radial extension. Whereas a decrease in the rate of rotation of the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> will cause the sensor to retract, that is, the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> rotation rate may be indirectly expressed as a radial expansion of the sensor. Using a sensor, a spring, and an excitation source, the instrument can perform command transfer based on drill string rotation rate changes. The mechanical structure of the entire sensor and excitation system is very complex and can only measure the change in the rate of rotation of the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe.</b> It cannot measure the increase in the angle of rotation of the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe.</b> This method may cause large errors in the signal transmission when the drill string is rotated at a low rate due to the centrifugal force acting on the sensor in drilling the inclined shaft.|$|R

5000|$|The {{top drive}} allows the {{drilling}} rig to drill the longer section of a stand of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> in one operation. A rotary table type rig can only drill 30 ft (single <b>drill</b> <b>pipe)</b> sections of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> whereas a top drive can drill 60 - 90 ft stands (double and triple <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> respectively, a triple being three joints of drillpipe screwed together), depending on {{the drilling rig}} size. Handling longer sections of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> enables a <b>drilling</b> rig to make greater daily progress because up to 90 ft can be drilled at a time, thus requiring fewer [...] "connections" [...] to add another 30 ft of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe.</b> Another advantage of top drive systems is time efficiency.

This happened because the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> elastically buckled within the wellbore due to forces induced on the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> during loss of well control, consequently, <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> in process of shearing was deformed outside the shearing blade surfaces, and, consequently, the blind shearing rams were not able to move the entire pipe cross section into the shearing surfaces of the blades. Therefore, oil continued to flow through the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> trapped between the ram block faces and subsequently through the gaps between the ram blocks. Since the pipe buckled when well control was lost, the blind shear rams would have failed to function as planned no matter when they were made active.|$|R

40|$|Advanced Composite Products and Technology, Inc. (ACPT) has {{developed}} composite <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> (CDP) {{that matches the}} structural and strength properties of steel <b>drill</b> <b>pipe,</b> but weighs less than 50 percent of its steel counterpart. Funding for the multiyear {{research and development of}} CDP was provided by the U. S. Department of Energy Office of Fossil Energy through the Natural Gas and Oil Projects Management Division at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). Composite materials made of carbon fibers and epoxy resin offer mechanical properties comparable to steel at less than half the weight. Composite <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> consists of a composite material tube with standard <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> steel box and pin connections. Unlike metal <b>drill</b> <b>pipe,</b> composite <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> can be easily designed, ordered, and produced to meet specific requirements for specific applications. Because it uses standard joint connectors, CDP can be used in lieu of any part of or for the entire steel <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> section. For low curvature extended reach, deep directional drilling, or ultra deep onshore or offshore drilling, the increased strength to weight ratio of CDP will increase the limits in all three drilling applications. Deceased weight will reduce hauling costs and increase the amount of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> allowed on offshore platforms. In extreme extended reach areas and high-angle directional drilling, drilling limits are associated with both high angle (fatigue) and frictional effects resulting from the combination of high angle curvature and/or total weight. The radius of curvature for a hole as small as 40 feet (12. 2 meters) or a build rate of 140 degrees per 100 feet is within the fatigue limits of specially designed CDP. Other properties that can be incorporated into the design and manufacture of composite <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> and make it attractive for specific applications are corrosion resistance, non-magnetic intervals, and abrasion resistance coatings. Since CDP has little or no electromagnetic force fields up to 74 kilohertz (KHz), a removable section of copper wire can be placed inside the composite pipe to short the tool joints electrically allowing electromagnetic signals inside the collar to induce and measure the same within the rock formation. By embedding a pair of wires in the composite section and using standard <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> box and pin ends equipped with a specially developed direct contact joint electrical interface, power can be supplied to measurement-while-drilling (MWD) and logging-while-drilling (LWD) bottom hole assemblies. Instantaneous high-speed data communications between near drill bit and the surface are obtainable utilizing this 'smart' drilling technology. The composite <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> developed by ACPT has been field tested successfully in several wells nationally and internationally. These tests were primarily for short radius and ultra short radius directional drilling. The CDP in most cases performed flawlessly with little or no appreciable wear.

The morphology and composition of the corrosion products were analyzed as well. It was found that the average corrosion rate of the two types of steel increased with increasing temperature of the corrosive medium, with the corrosion rate to decrease slightly within 60 ℃- 80 ℃ and keep almost unchanged above 120 ℃.

The solution starts with the ability to measure different modes of vibration, hence identifying different vibration mechanisms. Lateral, torsion and axial are vibration modes that take place when <b>drill</b> <b>pipes</b> run into problems downhole. Due to the three modes of vibration mechanisms such as bit bounce, stick-slip, lateral shocks, bit and bottom hole assembly (BHA) whirl, parametric and torsional resonance occur. Understanding the causes of the destructive loads is the main step towards developing approaches to prevent or reduce their effects, hence improving drilling performance. Vibration modes and mechanisms lead to failure of the <b>drill</b> <b>pipes,</b> BHA and <b>drill</b> bits. <b>Drill</b> <b>pipes</b> fatigue failure is very common due to capability of producing all vibration modes and mechanisms. <b>Drill</b> <b>pipe</b> and downhole tool assembly failure usually result from failing to have power over {{one or more of}} these vibration mechanisms.
