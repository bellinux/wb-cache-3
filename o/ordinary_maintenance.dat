40|$|Problem statement: Nowadays {{high levels}} of {{experience}} have been acquired in the excavation of horizontal tunnels using TBM, especially as far as tunnels with small diameters (about 4 m wide) are concerned.

Approach: This study presented the results of studies which compare the production data collected for tunnels excavated with TBM in "normal" conditions (horizontal tunnel), with those derived from steeply inclined excavations (up-hill tunnels). Results: From an examination of the results obtained in the studied cases a net difference appears evident in terms of productivity between horizontal and up-hill excavations. Conclusion: Such net difference between horizontal and up-hill excavation productions can be attributed to the greater burdens of times necessary for the supply of materials and personnel, the regripping operations with fall preventer systems and, in general, the greater difficulties of carrying out <b>ordinary</b> and extraordinary <b>maintenance</b> of the machines in particularly difficult altrimetric conditions...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} {{case from the}} steel industry, waste {{hydrochloric}} acid from the pickling process is regenerated using spray roasting. The process is driven by four burners placed symmetrically along {{the periphery of the}} cylindrical main section of the reactor.

40|$|The {{standard}} {{view is that}} rent regulation {{leads to}} a reduction in maintenance, as the landlord will be able to find tenants at the regulated rent even if the level of maintenance is low.

It is shown that when there is a housing shortage this system creates economic incentives for increasing the standard of apartments, even if this reduces total welfare.

40|$|This essay {{presents}} the work {{carried out by}} the University of Brescia which got involved with the Municipality of Nave (Brescia) in 2014 to deal with the particular situation of Monteclana. Its position on the border of the town, outside the main route, the lack of buildings maintenance, the lack of public services and elements with appeal don’t allow for any other prospects apart from the progressive abandonment and the decrease of possibilities to bring it back to an attractive place to live and work in. In Italy this destiny is very common among many villages and local administrations struggle to contest it. The only planning tools available can’t regenerate these areas on their own. Moreover local administration has little room to manoeuvre because of the scarcity of public funds and difficulties in activating procedures with private subjects to stimulate any changes. Starting from the administration’s targets – to enhance the aesthetic image of Monteclana and to subsidize the participation of citizens in <b>ordinary</b> building <b>maintenance</b> – the University of Brescia has carried out a survey aimed at giving an account of the status quo of the buildings, bringing to light the whole complex effects of private intervention on buildings in the last thirty years. The survey analyses the method followed in each intervention and the level of the impact, due to the moderately free way used to operate on our historical heritage. Furthermore, the University of Brescia has proposed an operating solution to improve the aesthetic image of Monteclana. On the basis of an image, respectful of its preexistence, recognizable and shared with the citizens, the urban planning tools for the historical centre have been completed by guide lines concerning the external structures. Streamlined procedures have been established to involve more citizens in investing in the maintenance of their property...|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of its construction, the Midland was among the best-appointed roads in the United States. Ten of the {{locomotives}} it purchased in 1886 and 1887 (the Class 115 2-8-0s) were among the largest and most powerful of their type in the United States. Unfortunately, the Midland's cash situation militated against capital replacement, and most of the locomotives purchased in the road's first decade were still on the property when it closed in 1918. The Midland purchased its last locomotives, the Class 175 2-8-0s, in 1907; after that, the purchase of new power fell behind <b>ordinary</b> operations and <b>maintenance</b> expenses on the company's priority list, and was postponed in part because of concerns about the ability of the roadbed and track to support heavier equipment. At the outbreak of the First World War, the road's chief mechanical officer proposed the immediate construction of a new class of engines to handle the surging traffic, but the state of the road's physical plant (which urgently needed both maintenance and upgrading) was such that he limited his proposal to a copy of the D&RGW's C-48 class locomotives, a design that was thirteen years old and approaching obsolescence.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the arrival}} of lapped {{porcelain}} stoneware tiles on the market, several studies have {{been focused on the}} improvement of the technical characteristics of the surfaces of these products. Surface lapping induces aesthetical improvements, but can at the same time deteriorate the performance of porcelain stoneware tiles. To overcome this problem, it is possible to protect the lapped surface with commercial waterproofing materials. In this work, lapped commercial porcelain stoneware tiles with protective stain proofing agents (FILA PD 15 and FILA 1239 Plus) were evaluated.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{electrical}} energy is globally growing very quickly. For this reason, the optimization of power plant productions and power plant maintenance scheduling have become important research topics. A Large Scale Energy Management (LSEM) problem is studied in this paper. Two types of power plants are considered: power plants of type 1 can be refueled while still operating.

In this article we formulate an answer to the central research question “How did plural policing processes in Belgium originate and what is the current situation?” By means of a multiple case study with triangulation of methods, 27 years of security policy (1985 - 2012) are analysed. Contrasting with neo-liberal policies in the UK from the 1970 s on, Belgian policy was shaped by the powerful presence of socio-democrats who occupied key ministry positions in the federal government, such as the minister of the Interior and the minister of Big Cities, throughout the entire time period.

40|$|Abstract. The article {{examines}} the relationship between property value and level of conservation of public urban space. While many {{studies have examined the}} effect of “proximity ” of open space, parks, and trees on property value, there has been few examination of how projects of urban revitalization and <b>ordinary</b> and extraordinary <b>maintenances</b> of public spaces can influence property values.

We proposes the application of a new econometric models for quantitative analysis of the characteristics of real estate property (Generalized Additive Model), {{to assess the impact of}} maintenance condition on property values, due to the better prevision that these functions can obtain in a real estate market context. The control of the formal and logical adequacy of the proposed theoretical model is referred to the case study under analysis, in the city of Naples.
