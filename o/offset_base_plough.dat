40|$|A system using {{frequency}} <b>offset</b> <b>based</b> transmit- reference (TR) modulation allows multiple nodes {{to transmit}} simultaneously and asynchronously without any mutual timing coordination. Thus, {{such a system}} provides inherent capabilities for a multiple access in the medium access control (MAC) layer to coordinate the shared use of the common wireless medium among the nodes of the wireless sensor network (WSN). However, certain characteristics of a frequency <b>offset</b> <b>based</b> system limits its performance, for example, the number of available frequency offsets is limited as it depends on several system parameters, {{and the number of}} simultaneous communications using different frequency offsets is limited due to inter-user interference. In this paper, we introduce an extended version of the performance model of a basic slotted- Aloha system, that captures the basic phenomena of a multi- channel system with a limited set of channels and a limit to the number of simultaneously used channels. An analysis of this model reveals the potential of a MAC protocol for TR modulation with frequency offsets...|$|R

40|$|A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) {{consists}} of sensor nodes distributed across an area {{to collect and}} communicate information. Research {{in the field of}} WSNs became interesting in recent times because of the challenges and constraints these WSNs impose, e. g., limited available energy, achieve low complexity and low cost. These research challenges and the applications of WSNs require robust communication with low power consumption in the MAC layer, {{as well as in the}} physical layer. Transmit reference (TR) modulation in the physical layer offers a simple low power receiver architecture, achieves fast synchronization with short signal acquisition time, and provides multiple frequency offsets that can be used for multiple simultaneous communications. The main contributions of this dissertation are motivated by the research question of how to design a medium access control protocol to exploit the features of the underlying transmit reference modulation to provide energy-efficiency, traffic-adaptive behavior, and robust medium access control in a shared wireless environment. We introduce a new energy-efficient MAC protocol, called TR-MAC, which exploits the benefits of the TR modulation in the underlying physical layer, and minimizes its drawbacks. The analysis of this thesis improves the understanding of the frequency <b>offset</b> <b>based</b> transmit reference modulation, and proposes a medium access control protocol customized for this unique modulation technique, named as the TR-MAC protocol. The TR-MAC protocol exploits the fast synchronization capabilities of the underlying frequency <b>offset</b> <b>based</b> transmit reference modulation. Energy- efficiency is achieved in this TR-MAC protocol by using transceiver duty cycling mechanism and preamble sampling technique. Furthermore, this TR-MAC protocol achieves traffic-adaptive behavior while maintaining energy-efficiency by using a duty cycle adaptation algorithm. The multi-channel multiple access model using frequency offsets and the performance analysis of the TR-MAC protocol in a multiple access scenario show that the TR-MAC protocol together with frequency <b>offset</b> <b>based</b> TR modulation increases the throughput and efficiency of the system while maintaining energy-efficiency. The TR-MAC protocol is suitable for low data rate and low-duty-cycle sparse WSN scenarios, for example, monitoring and tracking applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to compare barycenter <b>offset</b> <b>based</b> designs of spherical robots to control moment gyroscope (CMG) based designs in order to determine which approach is most effective. The first objective was to develop a list of current state of the art designs in order to gain an overall understanding of what the obstacles in this area of research were. The investigation showed that barycenter offset designs can produce a low, continuous output torque, whereas CMG based designs can usually only produce a high, momentary output torque. The second objective was to develop a CMG based design that has the potential to outperform current state barycenter <b>offset</b> <b>based</b> designs. A design consisting of a dual, scissored-pair CMG (DSP-VSCMG) configuration was proposed and the dynamics derived from first principles. The third objective was to develop a set of equations that can describe performance characteristics of spherical robots. The equations that were modeled were power consumption, translational velocity, maximum incline plane, step size from rest, as well as CMG inertias and geometries. The fourth objective was to perform a series of parametric analysis using the developed equation set to compare barycenter and DSP-VSCMG based designs in a controlled environment. The analysis showed that DSP-VSCMG based designs can be more agile than barycenter designs, but require more power to do so...|$|R
