The filter length is estimated using an equiripple low-pass implementation and should be applied to both real and imaginary components of the baseband signal. In order to keep the distortion of the OFDM signal to a reasonable level at the output of the transmitter, the ripple in the band is set to 0.5 dB, while the end of the passband is set to the limit of the occupied bandwidth.|$|E

40|$|This note {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} implementing a reliable <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signal</b> {{for use in a}} host-to-host protocol. It is motivated by the fact that such a satisfactory mechanism does not exist in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) of Cerf et. al. [reference 4, 6] In addition to discussing some requirements for such an <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signal</b> (interrupts) and the implications for the implementation of the requirements, a discussion of the problem for the TCP case will be presented. While the ARPANET host-to-host protocol does not support reliable transmission of either data or controls, it does meet the other requirements we have for an out-of-band control signal and will be drawn upon to provide a solution for the TCP case. The TCP currently handles all data and controls on the same logical channel. To achieve reliable transmission, it provides positive acknowledgement and retransmission of all data and most controls. Since interrupts are on the same channel as data, the TCP must flush data whenever an interrupt is sent {{so as not to be}} subject to flow control. Functional Requirements It is desirable to insure reliable delivery of an interrupt. The sender must be assured that one and only one interrupt is delivered at the destination for each interrupt it sends. The protocol need not be concerned about the order of delivery of interrupts to the user. The interrupt signal must be independent of data flow control mechanisms. An interrupt must be delivered whether or not there are buffers provided for data, whether or not other controls are being handled. The interrupt should not interfere with the reliable delivery of other data and controls. The host-to-host protocol need not provide synchronization between the interrupt channel and the data-control channel. In fact, if coupling of the channels relies on the advancement of sequence numbers on the data-control channel, then the interrupt channel is no longer independent of flow control as required above. The synchronization with the data stream can be performed by the user b...|$|E

The stopband attenuation of these decimators is more than 120 dB. The decimators contain no generd multipliers and a few data memory locations. thereby making them easily VLSI-realizable. This is achieved by using several decimation stages with each stage containing {{a small number of}} delays and arithmetic operations. Some of the stages have been constructed using low-order building blocks which are combined to give a selective filter using a few additional tap coefficients and adders.

By suppressing the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signal</b> with two broadened symmetric SBS losses, pass bandwidth can be tuned from 500 MHz to 10 GHz. Considering the limited interaction {{in the center}} frequency range, a flat-top response with 0. 3 dB ripple is easily achieved. Unlike a SBS gain based filter, due to the transparency of the pass band in our proposed filter, hardly no noise is detected in a noise measurement against an obvious maximum 5 dB noise pedestal for a SBS gain based one. Considering the wide independent bandwidth and center frequency tunability, flat-top response, and low-noise characteristic, our proposed filter can be perfectly used as a supplement of most commericalized tunable single bandpass filters, whose minimum bandwidth is limited by 10 GHz.

40|$|Abstract — Spectrum sensing is {{essential}} to the realization of spectrum agility in cognitive radio (CR) networks. Although fundamental tradeoffs and theoretical limits associated with spectrum sensing have been studied extensively, there have been very few experimental studies focused on building a spectrum “sensor ” with commercial off-the-shelf devices. We have therefore built a prototype of CR-based sensor implementation with offthe-shelf IEEE 802. 11 devices. 1 In particular, we have explored issues in implementing a spectrum sensor, mostly at the MAC layer, as well as the difficulty in implanting sensing functions into industrial network interfaces. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of building a spectrum sensor and the construction of an incumbent-detection mechanism with off-theshelf devices. We have also identified technical difficulties, such as device-dependency in determining the detection threshold, inband signal jamming between secondary devices, and adjacent channel interference due to <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signal</b> emission. This experimental experience has led us to suggest a sensor design guideline for commercial wireless interfaces which can also facilitate other CR-related research. I...|$|E

40|$|Interference filters {{assembled}} in ‘butcher-block’ arrays are used close to focal plane arrays for spectral definition in sensors such as VIIRS. Ideally only light incident {{on a particular}} filter above a detector element which is within the specified band will reach the detector. Optical cross-talk is in-band or out-of-band light incident on an adjacent filter or adjacent region of the same filter reaching the detector. Out-of-band optical cross-talk results in spectral and spatial ‘impurities’ in the signal and consequent errors in the calculated environmental parameters such as ocean color that rely on calculations based on combinations of signals {{from more than one}} band. <b>Out-of-band</b> <b>signal</b> and out-of-band optical cross-talk was observed in testing of VIIRS Flight 1 despite the apparent lack of <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signal</b> in the filters as previously specified and measured during the procurement and build process. To correct this for VIIRS Flight 2 and subsequent, new laboratory measurements, Total Transmission and Slit Modified Transmission, using standard laboratory spectrophotometers with commercial attachments were developed at Raytheon and are discussed. Measurements with these techniques demonstrated that the out-of-band features observed at the sensor level are also seen at the individual filter level. These features are due to the Stierwalt effect where out-of-band features are observed when a detector is in proximity to a filter (near field), as the out-of-band light exits the filter assembly at discrete large angles from normal, to which the term “Angle Resolved Scatter” (ARS) has also been applied. Thus filters can be characterized using commercially available spectrophotometer techniques at the filter level prior to assembling into butcher-blocks or testing at a higher integration level for optical cross-talk. The simplicity of these techniques allows the filter manufacturer to incorporate them in their testing. This capability was incorporated and implemented into Raytheon specifications for filters and filter assemblies for the VIIRS VIS/NIR filters for VIIRS F 2 and subsequent flights. Testing of these new filters at the component level using the Total Transmission and Slit Modified Transmission techniques showed the absence of these ARS optical cross-talk features. In-band scatter measurements showed significantly reduced scatter compared with Flight 1 as expected as the out-of-band light observed for the Stierwalt effect is a combination of scattering and optical design. Further measurements at the butcher-block level were made demonstrating that the filter-level measurements were a good indicator of optical cross-talk performance at the next higher level. This presentation will present the techniques developed and the correlation between filter-level and butcher-block-level performance for out-of-band features...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Zero echo time (ZTE) imaging with single-pulse {{excitation}} is a fast, robust, {{and silent}} three-dimensional (3 D) method for MRI of short T 2 tissues. In this technique, algebraic reconstruction serves to fill {{gaps in the}} center of k-space due to finite acquisition dead time. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of this operation on depiction characteristics, noise behavior, and achievable bandwidth. Methods: The spatial response function (SRF) and noise covariance resulting from ZTE reconstruction were studied using formal analysis, simulations, and phantom experiments. Results: Three prominent limiting phenomena were identified: SRF behavior within the field of view, heightened sensitivity to <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signal</b> sources, and noise amplification. The related errors all appear as image distortions of low spatial frequency and are strongly attenuated upon the transition from one-dimensional projections to 3 D image data. Relying on these observations, ZTE imaging was accomplished with a previously unreached gap size, permitting the depiction of a solid sample with T 2 ≈ 25 µs at a bandwidth of 500 kHz. Conclusion: The tightest bandwidth limits in ZTE arise from background signal and radiofrequency (RF) switching transients.

40|$|Delta-Sigma Analog-to Digital Converters have {{recently}} become important for providing high resolution with monotonicity and reasonable signal-to-distortion ratings {{without the need}} for laser trimming techniques. This has come about because of the recent ability to combine both extensive digital computation power, and switched-capacitor analog circuitry on a monolithic chip. Delta-Sigma converters have primarily been used, however, in signal processing applications, notably digital audio, but not for instrumentation. The purpose of this dissertation is to provide a high accuracy, DC-accurate, Delta-Sigma Analog-to-Digital converter in monolithic form. Autocalibration gives endpoint correction, and chopper stabilization minimizes the effect of parameter shifts, drift, and flicker noise. A digital filter, needed for all Delta-Sigma converters, serves as a signal processor to reject out-of-band noise and resonant responses of the external system. A 3 -micron, double-poly CMOS process is used. Power requirements are +/- 5 Volts. A six-pole Gaussian IIR digital filter is chosen for good transient response and no overshoot. The filter algorithm and hardware solve the difference equations of a low-pass switched-capacitor prototype filter in digital form. Due to the low bandwidth needed, an area-efficient shift-and-add architecture is used. The area is further reduced with a novel multiplication algorithm, and the logic is reused to perform the calculations required for calibration. The system level device performance is verified in FORTRAN. The analog subcircuits are simulated over process and temperature corners in HSPICE.

40|$|The {{design of}} a single-loop continuous-time ?? {{modulator}} (CT??M) with high resolution, wide bandwidth, and low power consumption is very challenging. The multi-stage noise-shaping (MASH) CT??M architecture is identified as an advancement to the single-loop CT??M architecture {{in order to satisfy}} the ever stringent requirements of next generation wireless systems. However, it suffers from the problems of quantization noise leakage and non-ideal interstage interfacing which hinder its widespread adoption. To solve these issues, this dissertation proposes a MASH CT??M with on-chip RC time constant calibration circuits, multiple feedforward interstage paths, and a fully integrated noise cancellation filter (NCF). The prototype core modulator architecture is a cascade of two single-loop second- order CT??M stages, each of which consists of an integrator-based active-RC loop filter, current-steering feedback digital-to-analog converters, and a four-bit flash quantizer. On-chip RC time constant calibration circuits and high gain multi-stage operational amplifiers are realized to mitigate quantization noise leakage due to process variation. Multiple feedforward interstage paths are introduced to (i) synthesize a fourth-order noise transfer function with DC zeros, (ii) simplify the design of NCF, and (iii) reduce signal swings at the second-stage integrator outputs. Fully integrated in 40 nm CMOS, the prototype chip achieves 74. 4 dB of signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR), 75. 8 dB of signal-to-noise ratio, and 76. 8 dB of dynamic range in 50. 3 MHz of bandwidth (BW) at 1 GHz of sampling frequency with 43. 0 mW of power consumption (P).

40|$|The Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI) {{spectral}} response was determined {{through a series}} of ground based tests conducted with the HFI focal plane in a cryogenic environment prior to launch. The main goal of the spectral transmission tests was to measure the relative {{spectral response}} (including <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signal</b> rejection) of all HFI detectors. This was determined by measuring the output of a continuously scanned Fourier transform spectrometer coupled with all HFI detectors. As there is no on-board spectrometer within HFI, the ground-based spectral response experiments provide the definitive data set for the relative spectral calibration of the HFI. The spectral response of the HFI is used in Planck data analysis and component separation, this includes extraction of CO emission observed within Planck bands, dust emission, Sunyaev-Zeldovich sources, and intensity to polarization leakage. The HFI spectral response data have also been used to provide unit conversion and colour correction analysis tools. Verifications of the HFI spectral response data are provided through comparisons with photometric HFI flight data. This validation includes use of HFI zodiacal emission observations to demonstrate out-of-band spectral signal rejection better than 10 ^ 8.

40|$|Abstract Subsampling {{can be used}} in a radio {{receiver}} to perform signal downconversion and sample-and-hold operations in order to relieve the operation frequency and bandwidth requirements of the subsequent discrete-time circuitry. However, due to the inherent aliasing behaviour of wideband noise and interference in subsampling, and the difficulty of implementing appropriate bandpass anti-aliasing filtering at high frequencies, straightforward use of a low subsampling rate can result in significant degradation of the receiver dynamic range. The aim of this thesis is to investigate and implement methods for integrating filtering into high-frequency signal sampling and downconversion by subsampling to alleviate the requirements for additional front-end filters and to mitigate the effects of noise and <b>out-of-band</b> <b>signal</b> aliasing, thereby facilitating use in integrated high-quality {{radio receiver}}s. The charge-domain sampling technique studied here allows simple integration of both continuous-and discrete-time filtering functions into high-frequency signal sampling. Gated current integration results in a lowpass sin(x) /x(sinc(x)) response capable of performing built-in anti-aliasing filtering in baseband signal sampling. Weighted integration of several successive current samples can be further used to obtain an embedded discrete-time finite-impulse-response (FIR) filtering response, which can be used for internal anti-aliasing and image-rejection filtering in the downconversion of bandpass signals by subsampling. The detailed analysis of elementary charge-domain sampling circuits presented here shows that the use of integrated FIR filtering with subsampling allows acceptable noise figures to be achieved and can provide effective internal anti-aliasing rejection. The new methods for increasing the selectivity of elementary charge-domain sampling circuits presented here enable the integration of advanced, digitally programmable FIR filtering functions into high-frequency signal sampling, thereby markedly relieving the requirements for additional anti-aliasing, image rejection and possibly even channel selection filters in a radio receiver. BiCMOS and CMOS IF sampler implementations are presented in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the charge-domain sampling technique for integrated anti-aliasing and image-rejection filtering in IF signal quadrature downconversion by subsampling. Circuit measurements show that this sampling technique for built-in filtering results in an accurate frequency response and allows the use of high subsampling ratios while still achieving a competitive dynamic range...|$|E
