50|$|Like {{all other}} stingless bees, Trigona spinipes is highly social. When foraging, the workers utilize {{polarized}} odor-trail communication to relay {{the locations of}} food sources to each other. Unlike classic pheromone trails which extend from the food source to the nest, these polarized pheromone signals are short and do not reach the nest. They likely evolved to be short so as to not lead eavesdropping predators back to their nest. What makes these trails polarized {{is that they are}} strongest at the food source and taper off moving away from it. This allows other bees following the signal to arrive at the food in large numbers without wasting time looking for food along the trail. <b>Octyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> is the most significant component of the trail pheromone. It is emitted from the cephalic labial glands of Trigona spinipes and makes up approximately 74% of the secretion. Studies found synthetically produced <b>octyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> to be equally attractive to natural extract derived from the labial glands of foragers.|$|E
50|$|Mediterranean hartwort {{does have}} edible leaves. In Italy {{it is used}} as a condiment. The {{essential}} oil composition of aerial parts of Tordylium apulum L. from Italy was analyzed. Sixty-seven compounds were identified representing 96.5% of the oil. The most abundant compounds were (E)-β-ocimene (17.3), α-humulene (11.4%) and <b>octyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> (8.8%). Essential oil from aerial parts of T. apulum from Greece was reported to have α-humulene (28.7%) and octyl hexanoate (11.7%) as the main constituents. There are no known medicinal uses for this plant.|$|E
40|$|Stingless bees of {{the species}} Trigona spinipes (Fabricius 1793) use their saliva to lay scent trails {{communicating}} the location of profitable food sources. Extracts of the cephalic labial glands of the salivary system (not the mandibular glands, however) contain a large amount (approx. 74 %) of <b>octyl</b> <b>octanoate.</b> This ester is also found on the scent-marked substrates at the feeding site. We demonstrate <b>octyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> to be a single compound pheromone which induces full trail following behaviour. The identification of the trail pheromone in this widely distributed bee makes it an ideal organism for studying the mechanism of trail following in a day flying insect. © 2007 The Royal Society...|$|E
40|$|The {{apparent}} molar heat capacity, phi-c, its associative part, phi-c(assoc), and {{the excess}} heat capacity, C(p) E, {{have been obtained}} at 25 -degrees-C through the concentration range for methanol, hexan- 1 -ol and decan- 1 -ol {{in a series of}} proton acceptor solvents: methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, <b>octyl</b> acetate, methyl <b>octanoate,</b> decyl acetate and methyl tetradecanoate. The results are explained quantitatively by the Tresczanowicz-Kehiaian (TK) association model and the Flory lattice model in terms of alcohol self-association into tetramers, characterized by an OH-OH equilibrium constant and enthalpy, and by alcohol-ester complex formation characterized by an OH-COO equilibrium constant and enthalpy, each independent of alcohol and ester chain length. As predicted, phi-c(assoc) at infinite alcohol dilution is independent of the choice of alcohol, but increases with increasing ester chain length. With increasing alcohol concentration phi-c(assoc) passes through a maximum which is much reduced compared with the inert solvent case. For each alcohol, C(p) E increases with increasing ester chain length, while for the same ester, C(p) E decreases with increasing alcohol chain length. dC(p) E/dT is positive for mixtures of methanol and methyl acetate, as predicted by the TK model. It is negative for decanol with methyl acetate, contrary to the TK model, but consistent with a non-random distribution of alcohol tetramers in the solution...|$|R

Under the same conditions, 1 -hexanol and 1 -octanol give hexyl hexanoate and <b>octyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> respectively. On the other hand, cinnamyl alcohol undergoes disproportionation to 3 -phenylpropanol and cinnamaldehyde. Â© 2011 American Chemical Society.

40|$|Foragers {{can improve}} search efficiency, and {{ultimately}} fitness, by using social information: cues and signals produced by other animals that indicate food location or quality. Social information use {{has been well}} studied in predator-prey systems, but its functioning within a trophic level remains poorly understood. Eavesdropping, use of signals by unintended recipients, {{is of particular interest}} because eavesdroppers may exert selective pressure on signaling systems. We provide the most complete study to date of eavesdropping between two competing social insect species by determining the glandular source and composition of a recruitment pheromone, and by examining reciprocal heterospecific responses to this signal. We tested eavesdropping between Trigona hyalinata and Trigona spinipes, two stingless bee species that compete for floral resources, exhibit a clear dominance hierarchy and recruit nestmates to high-quality food sources via pheromone trails. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of T. hyalinata recruitment pheromone revealed six carboxylic esters, the most common of which is <b>octyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> the major component of T. spinipes recruitment pheromone. We demonstrate heterospecific detection of recruitment pheromones, which can influence heterospecific and conspecific scout orientation. Unexpectedly, the dominant T. hyalinata avoided T. spinipes pheromone in preference tests, while the subordinate T. spinipes showed neither attraction to nor avoidance of T. hyalinata pheromone. We suggest that stingless bees may seek to avoid conflict through their eavesdropping behavior, incorporating expected costs associated with a choice into the decision-making process. © 2010 The Author(s) ...|$|E
