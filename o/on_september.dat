5|$|A northwestward moving {{tropical}} wave {{moved out}} the Caribbean Sea <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 1 {{and became a}} tropical depression <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 2 after crossing southern Florida. Still moving northwestward, the tropical depression made landfall in southeastern Louisiana <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 4. A building high pressure system over the Central United States forced the tropical depression to move southwest over the Gulf of Mexico. The warm waters then cause the depression to reach tropical storm strength and the storm was given the name Fern by the National Hurricane Center <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 7.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved into}} the Pacific Ocean from Central America <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 10. Convection along the wave became better organized as it moved westward, and a tropical depression developed <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 18. The depression moved generally west-northwestward before strengthening into Tropical Storm Marty <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 19. The storm entrained dry air into its circulation as it curved toward the northwest, disrupting the storm's convective structure and inhibiting further intensification {{for the next two}} days. Eventually, Marty fought off the dry air and intensified, reaching hurricane strength <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 21.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa behind Hurricane Luis on August 31. Strong outflow from Luis prevented development of the wave, and it continued westward until crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 12. Convection increased as it moved through the Gulf of Tehuantepec, and the cloud pattern organized sufficiently to warrant Dvorak classifications for the system <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 15. Based on the development of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Eleven-E <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 16 while located around 290miles (465km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Due to the tropical depression moving over an area of warm water temperatures with favorable upper level outflow, the National Hurricane Center forecast the tropical depression to slowly intensify to 70mph (110km/h) winds within 72hours the forecast early <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 16.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the eastern coast of Africa on August 21 and moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development. <b>On</b> <b>September</b> 3, the disturbance merged with a dissipating upper level low pressure system over Hispaniola and Puerto Rico and developed an increasing cloud mass as it continued westward. As the disturbance crossed the Bahamas, satellite imagery showed the disturbance gaining a distinct circulation <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 5. <b>On</b> <b>September</b> 6, the disturbance became a Tropical Depression before it made landfall in southeastern Florida {{on the same}} day.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the western coast of Africa <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 1. An {{area of low pressure}} {{associated with the}} wave moved slowly westward, and its convection initially appeared to become better organized. <b>On</b> <b>September</b> 3, as it passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands, organization within the system degraded, though convection increased the next day. The system gradually became better organized, and Dvorak classifications began early <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 5. Based on the development of a closed surface circulation, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen early <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 6. Hours later, it intensified into Tropical Storm Isabel, though operationally the National Hurricane Center did not begin issuing advisories until 13hours after it first developed.|$|E

5|$|After {{entering}} the Gulf of California, an eye began to become apparent on visible satellite imagery, {{and it is}} estimated Isis attained hurricane status late <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 2.

After entering Nevada <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 5, the remnants of Isis passed into Oregon before dissipating in Idaho <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 8.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} its peak intensity for 12hours Fabian degraded due to internal fluctuations, {{and began to}} weaken. The hurricane turned to the northwest <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 2 {{in response to a}} weakness in the subtropical ridge, a break caused by a mid-level circulation over the southwest Atlantic Ocean. After fading back to a Category3 hurricane, Fabian re-intensified <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 4, and regained Category4 status for a short time. The hurricane weakened again as it accelerated northward towards Bermuda, a motion due to an approaching mid-level trough. As small pockets of dry air became entrained in the eyewall, Fabian weakened slightly, passing just 14miles (23km) west of Bermuda <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 5 as a 115mph (185km/h) Category 3 hurricane. The eastern portion of the eyewall moved over the island, resulting in a direct hit; however, as the center did not move over the island, Fabian did not make landfall. After passing the island, the hurricane accelerated northeastward, and weakened to a 105mph (165km/h) Category2 hurricane <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 7. Steady weakening occurred as the hurricane moved into an area of increasing wind shear, drier air, and progressively cooler waters. <b>On</b> <b>September</b> 8, while located 680miles (1095km) east-northeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, Fabian transitioned into an extratropical storm, with no deep convection remaining near the center. The extratropical remnant turned to the north <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 9, and <b>on</b> <b>September</b> 10 it merged with another extratropical storm while located between southern Greenland and Iceland.|$|E
