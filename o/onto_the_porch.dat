25|$|The next morning, either June 17 or 18, {{the band}} of about 30 Native Americans {{returned}} to their hidden positions and awaited the settlers. When the settlers awoke, Brigham and Phillips went <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of Ament's cabin where they conversed for a few minutes, failing to notice the moccasin tracks around the property. Phillips {{decided to go to}} his cabin, about a half mile (.8km) from Ament's property, to finish a letter to his parents. Brigham, intending to accompany Phillips, entered his cabin for a moment, and once inside he heard the sound of musket fire outside. Phillips, mortally wounded, fell to the ground, struck by two musket balls. The band of raiding Native Americans immediately descended upon him with their tomahawks.|$|E

2500|$|The downstairs {{consisted}} of a parlor, dining room, central hallway, and two bedrooms. [...] Both the parlor and the front bedroom had French doors that opened <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> [...] The upstairs had four small bedrooms, each with a dormer. [...] Classical wood columns supported the porch roof, and a white picket fence surrounded the house. [...] A detached brick kitchen was in the rear, and {{on either side of}} the house were [...] garden plots. [...] Williams estimated that the house cost $7,472.|$|E
5000|$|Two small {{bedrooms}} {{where the}} three girls slept. The original bedrooms each contained two {{windows and a}} door that opened <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> front <b>porch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Internally, the {{two floors}} of the {{building}} are arranged around a central hall which continues northward from {{the position of the}} front door {{to the rear of the}} building. On the ground floor the front door provide access to a large porch area which incorporates the area of the tower element. The large proportion of window openings in the walls ensure that this porch area and a similar area on the first floor are naturally lit and ventilated. The flooring in <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> is of terrazzo tiles which have been formed into patterns reflecting the unusual planform of the spaces. French doors open <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porches</b> from internal rooms.|$|R
50|$|A single-bay {{entrance}} pavilion projects <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> south <b>porch,</b> overlooking <b>the</b> larger {{pond and}} its stone bridge. It is {{topped with a}} railed balcony. The doorway is heavily ornamented with classical molded surround, pilasters, sidelights, entablature and leaded transom. The south elevation also has solid and latticework supports with decorated balusters and brackets.|$|R
2500|$|The side {{elevations}} of {{the house}} have small single-story porches, supported by three Doric columns. [...] A fourth porch spans the rear {{of the house}}, connecting the additions, with a rear door similar in detail to the front opening <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> [...] Two more doors access the side porches. [...] A set of three doors opens onto the deck formed by the roof of the rear porch. [...] The windows in the house are double-hung, with six-over-six lights, many of which are original to the house. [...] The roof is covered with asphalt shingling, and a set of low-sloped dormers project to the rear.|$|E
2500|$|On Friday, May 10, in Atoka, Oklahoma, a {{man walked}} up to a woman's house and opened her screen door. He asked Mrs. Harmon {{if he could have}} some {{turpentine}}, food, and money. Mrs. Harmon told the man that she had very little turpentine and had no money or food. The man then grabbed Mrs. Harmon by the hair and dragged her out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> He told her that he might as well kill her since he had already killed three or four people and {{that he was going to}} rape her. He then heard a horse galloping towards them and told her, [...] "There comes a man on a horse. If you report this to officers I'll come back and kill you." [...] After the man ran off, the woman took her child with her to a neighbor's house further up the street and reported it to the police. Soon after her report, a widespread search for the man included 20 officers and 160 residents. She described the man as a 5'9-10 white man about 40 or 45 years old, about 150 to 155pounds, with dark hair, and was in bad need of a shave. He carried an open, five-inch bladed pocket knife and was wearing gloves, a faded and worn blue shirt with khakis, and had an old, dirty, dark-colored flopped hat.|$|E
60|$|They {{went down}} the stone walk and up <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> Gross rang the bell. They waited. After a time they heard slow footsteps. The door opened. An elderly woman in a shapeless wrapper studied them impassively.|$|E
50|$|Manson {{was met by}} Shahrokh Hatami, an Iranian {{photographer}} and Tate's friend. Hatami was there to photograph Tate in advance of her departure for Rome the next day. Having seen Manson through a window as Manson approached the main house, Hatami had gone <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> front <b>porch</b> to {{ask him what he}} wanted.|$|R
50|$|Built in 1905 by the Alamo Lumber Company, {{the house}} is a fine local example of a Victorian-era {{residence}} and stylistic influences of the Queen Anne period. It features a distinctive octagonal plan, with porches providing additional spaces to complete the octagon. Because of its unusual floor plan, the house's central living room contains eight doors but no windows; four of <b>the</b> doors open <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> corner <b>porches.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{front door}} is framed with its {{original}} semicircular limestone arch with keystone and impost blocks. It opens {{on a large}} square room filling the building's southeast corner and extending two-thirds of its depth. A fireplace with original mantel is on the south wall; a narrow stair goes to the upper story behind the west wall while a door opens <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>porch.</b> <b>The</b> past presence of a chair rail {{in the room is}} evident from the plaster behind where it was. The original baseboard and some window trim remains.|$|R
60|$|With a jolt {{it stopped}} before the cottage, and a black-haired giant leaped out {{to run up}} <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> Without a pause he rushed into the house. On the couch lay Clayton. The man started in surprise, but with a bound was {{at the side of}} the {{sleeping}} man.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's the rumble, they're coming! I'll go <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> {{and meet}} them. It looks hospitable, and I want the poor child {{to have a}} good time after all her trouble," [...] said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the word. But after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable expression, for looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one young lady.|$|E

5000|$|The {{shooting}} occurred {{while the}} victims {{were in the process}} of conducting a backyard party. About fifteen people were in attendance at the time. According to officials, shortly before 11:00 p.m., one gunman who was situated in a nearby alley fired shots from a [...]40-caliber pistol and forced several people <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> back <b>porch.</b> <b>The</b> other gunman, equipped with a 7.62 mm caliber rifle and situated in the yard of an adjacent residence, then ambushed them as they tried to enter the house through a backdoor and shot the victims. Afterwards, the gunmen fled the scene on foot.|$|R
50|$|Acland Barton and Chapel were classed as a Grade I listed {{building}} in 1965. The house was completely rebuilt in the 15th century, and included its own private domestic chapel, {{licensed by the}} Bishop of Exeter. The date 1591 survives carved <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> wooden <b>porch,</b> and represents <b>the</b> modernisation and rebuilding of the house at that date involving the insertion into the great hall of a ceiling with room above, thus lowering {{the height of the}} house's principal room. This work was done by Hugh Acland (1543-1622), who lived at Acland his whole life.|$|R
5000|$|The complex was {{commissioned}} in 1880 by James Gordon Bennett, Jr. Legend states that Bennett placed a bet with his guest British Cavalry Officer, Captain Henry Augustus [...] "Sugar" [...] Candy that Candy would not ride his horse up <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> front <b>porch</b> of Newport's most exclusive men's club - The Newport Reading Room. Candy won the bet, but the Governors of the Reading Room were not amused. Bennett and his infamous short temper {{did not take}} this kindly, and soon set about creating his own retreat, what would eventually become The Newport Casino.|$|R
50|$|Alice wanders out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> where Russell {{has been}} waiting for her. He confesses his love for her, despite her poverty and family problems.|$|E
50|$|Folk and Jazz music {{emanated from}} the inside out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> with singers such as Judy Henske, Steve Gillette (who later wrote songs for the Stone Poneys) and Lee Mallory (later with Sagittarius, Millennium) {{performing}} here during the early '60s. Dave Myers sang folk songs at Café Frankenstein before forming his Del-Fi surf band, Dave Myers & the Surf-Tones. Comedian Lord Buckley performed here. Famous photographer Lewis Baltz was also an early regular.|$|E
50|$|Frykowski's {{hands had}} been bound with a towel. Freeing himself, Frykowski began {{struggling}} with Atkins, who stabbed at his legs {{with the knife}} with which she had been guarding him. As he fought his way toward and out the front door, <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> Watson caught up with Frykowski and struck him {{over the head with}} the gun multiple times, stabbed him repeatedly, and shot him twice. Watson broke the gun's right grip in the process.|$|E
50|$|The {{beginning}} of this historic house located in downtown Pontiac, Michigan is a cabin that dates to 1819 or 1820 just after the sawmill was up and running. The sawmill and cabin, each a Pontiac Company resource, were owned by Solomon and Sarah Sibley. Early additions to the cabin were made across {{the north and west}} sides. The front portion of the current house dates to 1840 and was a separate house moved here in 1867. Additions made to that newly formed edifice include a bathroom, dining room, fireplace, all {{around the turn of the}} century. <b>The</b> front <b>porch</b> was likely widened at this time. A side porch of Victorian style also was added on the east side with a side door entering <b>onto</b> it. <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> and door are since removed.|$|R
50|$|A ghostly {{woman has}} also been {{reported}} many times being around the Grove. She was spotted in the house by Hopkins right before he was opening up the restaurant. The woman {{has also been}} reported by a neighbor and her sister, who saw a “glowing white figure” on <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> This woman has been {{said to be the}} original owner, Minerva Fox Stilley. She has often been seen walking beside the house, and then stepping up through a wall of the house. On the inside, she emerges from the wall and then walks across the width of the house. This strange path makes more sense when one considers that the wall that she steps up through was once <b>the</b> back <b>porch</b> to <b>the</b> house before the 1870 addition was made. Instead of stepping up through a wall, she instead is probably stepping up <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> back <b>porch,</b> coming through a door that was {{at the back of the}} house, and walking across to what would have been the children's bedroom.|$|R
50|$|Richard wakes {{the next}} morning and manages to free himself. He runs to Elise's room, 117, and finds that her party has left. Despondent, he goes <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> hotel's <b>porch.</b> Suddenly, he hears Elise calling his name and sees her running towards him. They return to his room, 416, and make love. The next morning they agree to marry. Elise tells him that the first thing she will do for him is buy him a new suit, as the one he has been wearing is about 15 years out of date. Richard begins to show her how {{practical}} the suit is because of its many pockets. He is alarmed when he reaches into one and finds a Lincoln penny with a mint date of 1979. Seeing an item from his real present wrenches him out of his hypnotically induced time trip, and Richard feels himself rushing forward in time. Elise screams his name in horror as he is pulled inexorably out of 1912.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} dawn of July 1, he was apprehended by {{a squad of}} {{soldiers}}. In the jail he attended, Fr. Orona Madrigal and his brother were there, covered with wounds. While he was praying {{at the foot of}} the bed, the soldiers shot Fr. Cruz. His still living body was thrown <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> together with Fr. Orona. The two were then taken to Cuquío, where their bodies were dragged through the central square, during which they died.|$|E
50|$|The downstairs {{consisted}} of a parlor, dining room, central hallway, and two bedrooms. Both the parlor and the front bedroom had French doors that opened <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> The upstairs had four small bedrooms, each with a dormer. Classical wood columns supported the porch roof, and a white picket fence surrounded the house. A detached brick kitchen was in the rear, and {{on either side of}} the house were 10 acre garden plots. Williams estimated that the house cost $7,472.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Maxwell Harbin and {{his wife}} {{purchased}} the house in 1935 and changed {{the name of the}} home to Kenmore Woods because of the confusion with the home of George Washington's sister, Betty, in nearby Fredericksburg, Virginia. Sometime during the 1930s, a screened porch was added to {{the south side of the}} home. To create a passage from the house <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> it was necessary to cut through four courses of brick. It was around this time that electricity and plumbing were added to the house.|$|E
50|$|Stairwells to {{the north}} and south arrive at the upper level that is a mirror image of spaces about a central {{dividing}} wall running east-west. In each half the rooms work off a central corridor. This main dividing wall is cut through at its east and west ends to provide access between the two halves of the floor. In each half, the outer corner rooms open to the enclosed verandahs that run the length of the north and south sides; a large central room to <b>the</b> east opens <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> open <b>porch</b> and <b>the</b> central room to the west is partitioned into a number of small spaces and opens out to the rear landing. <b>The</b> deep open <b>porches</b> to <b>the</b> centre of the east side offer a prospect over the railway line to the suburb of Albion beyond. Tilting fanlights to the central north-south partition facilitate ventilation through the rooms. Throughout the walls and ceilings are painted and plastered masonry. Each stairwell is lit by a large window and contains a flight of timber stairs with a substantial timber handrail and decorative metal balustrade.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> front <b>porch,</b> {{accessible}} via concrete steps, {{leads to}} the paneled oak front door with beveled glass. The screen door, of white aluminum, was installed in 2001. To {{the right of the}} front door is a bay window with decorative brickwork. A similar bay window with a hipped roof is located on the right (north) side of the home, next to a tall brick chimney. Towards the rear of the building, also on the right side, is a single-hung window. On the rear of the house, wooden steps (reconstructed in 1999) lead <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> enclosed back <b>porch</b> through a wooden screen door and a wooden paneled door. A single double-hung window is the only one on the first-floor rear of the house. On the left (south) side of the structure is a pair of double-hung windows next to a door leading to the basement.|$|R
50|$|Off {{the kitchen}} is a pantry. Off {{the living room is}} the master bedroom. This tiny bedroom has an east window {{with a view of the}} barn. On the west wall of the room is a door, which exits <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>porch.</b> On <b>the</b> second floor, there is a narrow hall on the west side of the stairs. On the west side of the hall, on the south side of the house, there is a guest room. This, the house's largest bedroom, has {{bracketed}} shelves, intended for the display of objects. It is the only room in the house with this feature. On the west side of the hall is a walk-in closet, the only closet in the house. On the east side of the hall are two other bedrooms. The room to the west were used for laundry, dyeing, and other domestic activities. The south and east walls of this room, originally exterior walls have clapboard siding. There is no ceiling; rafters and roof sheathing can be seen overhead. The floor is wood.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} elevation {{includes the}} rest of the wrap-around porch and a protruding three-sided gable-roof topped bay. There is one double-hung window on the porch facing south; it features a leaded glass pane over a single pane. A door with two large frames of glass is set in the bay opening <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> A double-hung, one-over-one window is set in the southern and southeastern sides of the bay; two more double-hung, one-over-one windows, featuring single leaded-glass panes, are set in the wall west of the bay.|$|E
50|$|A {{wrap-around}} porch stretches {{around the}} west, south (front), and east {{sides of the}} house. On the front elevation, French windows with fanlights {{on either side of}} the portico open <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> Casement windows with lattice lights above sit on the second story above the French windows. On the east side, there are two French windows with casements above and a porte-cochère below a small balcony. Windows on the west elevation are one-over-one double-hung sash windows, except for casements on a sleeping porch off the rear of the house.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{house has}} two architectural {{features that are}} unique to this area and time period. First {{the exterior of the}} house appears to be made of stone. The planners employed a technique that George Washington had used at Mount Vernon to transform wood to the look of stone. Second is the front entrance to the house which has a uniquely hexagon shaped vestibule with French doors opening <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> The doorway is flanked on each side by an angled side panel. It is believed the original panel contained partial glass.|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred years}} ago, a young German {{engineer}} named Max Kämper, {{came as a}} visitor to Mammoth Cave. He became so enchanted with the cavern he obtained permission to map the vast system. For the next eight months Max, along with assistance from cave guide Ed Bishop, meticulously put together a highly detailed and accurate map revealing more of the cave than ever before. He probably never realized his work would be admired by generations to follow. Some admire its artistic expression of the cave. Others see beauty in its precision. Ultimately, {{it has become the}} iconic map for generations of future explorers, preserving the history of place names and cave features as well as the lives of individuals for whom various areas were named. On the warm summer evening of Monday, July 13, 1908, Max took a break from his cartographic masterpiece. Hotel manager Marty Charlet gave a porch party for guests. The Glasgow Daily Times reported, “The piano was moved <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> spacious <b>porch</b> of <b>the</b> hotel, and Mr. Max K[ä]mper, of Berlin, Germany, delighted the crowd with some excellent music on the violin accompanied by Miss Mayme Depp of this place. ...|$|R
50|$|The layout was {{square with}} four rooms {{on each of}} the two floors. The large wooden front door opened into a foyer. On the left of the foyer, along the south wall, was a flight of steps leading to the second floor. One could turn right into a parlor (the NE corner) or walk {{straight}} ahead into a dining room (SW corner). The kitchen was the NW corner of the first floor accessible from the dining room, and had a door to the backyard. On the second floor, there was a railing around the south stair opening, and a hall that ran beside the stairway {{to the front of the}} house. A central sitting room had a door <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> front <b>porch.</b> There was an entry door to both the NE bedroom and to the NW bedroom from the sitting room. The entry to the SW bedroom was through a door at the top of the stairs. Harry Jones added an indoor bathroom on stilts off the south side of the house, which was accessible from a door at the top of the stairs.|$|R
5000|$|Consultation {{over the}} verdict lasted {{for nearly two}} hours during which time {{observers}} and journalists were transferred by the police to a grated <b>porch</b> under <b>the</b> sun. The resentment of the journalists over this [...] "confinement" [...] didn't help. After two hours, the presiding judge entered the hall wearing a red hat, {{a sign that the}} verdict was death. He informed the condemned that they were sentenced to [...] "hanging until their spirit departs". Amnon Michaelov and Nachman Zitterbaum were sentenced to imprisonment [...] "until the commissioner chooses to free them" [...] due to their youth. When they heard the verdict the accused burst into song with the crowd in the hall joining them in a rendition of [...] "Hatikvah". Immediately afterwards the entire crowd was put <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> barred <b>porch</b> for three quarters of an hour until the jury left. It was reported that the crowd were told anyone trying to leave would [...] "be shot where they stood". The condemned parties were loaded into an armored vehicle that then made its way to the Acre Prison. Haviv's mother exercised self-control when the verdict was declared and remained silent throughout.|$|R
