40|$|Abstract. Conventional {{control of}} tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> can't achieve the ideal effect {{because of the}} {{complexity}} of its work process, uncertainty of construction environment. In order to solve the question, the intelligent control is expected. The neural network control has many characteristics such as self-adaption, self-organization, and can modify the corresponding parameters by learning about external knowledge, so it becomes research focus of tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> control system in recent years. In this paper the advantage and disadvantage of several kinds of neural network used in the tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> control are introduced, the development trends of tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> control is predicted...|$|R

Both purpose-built double-shield <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> began on the northern end, with the first arriving in Brisbane in July 2007 and cutting commencing in December after testing. At the time, the tunneling machines were the biggest in the world, weighing 4,000tonnes and being [...] in length. Each machine cost A$50million to build. The <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> of [...] diameter each were built by the German firm Herrenknecht and can dig up to [...] per day. When finished the <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> had placed 37,000precast linings. Smaller roadheader machines began from the southern end in February 2007.|$|R
40|$|A conceptually new {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} designing new <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> has been worked out. It has permitted to create an algotithm, a mathematical model and methods used for optimizing the parameters of the machines, and technical requirements for them. General-purpose rotary <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> for strippings have been validated, and the design of its type has been developed. The introduction {{of the results of the}} work and recommendations makes it possible to reduce the range and number of newly produced <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> for strippings, as well as to improve its engineering level.
