Following her friends in Kensington society, Olivia opened her home <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> a salon, beginning an important period in her life. When Yeats returned to London that year, Olivia became the centre of a blossoming literary movement. Yeats held a Monday evening salon; those who attended usually also visited Olivia's. She hosted, and became a nexus for, much of the pre-war literary activity in London. Notable attendees included Pound, Hilda Doolitle, Yeats, Wyndham Lewis, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Walter Morse Rummel, Richard Aldington, William Carlos Williams, T. E. Hulme and John Cournos. The gatherings were held in her drawing room, a place Pound described in a letter as [...] "full of white magic". Olivia was by now a well-known occultist and hosted séances in her drawing room. She became well-versed in astrology and palmistry, passing on what she knew to Dorothy who shared her interest. Both read grimoires; Olivia was an expert at [...] "drawing occult symbols" [...] and quite familiar with the symbology of the occult.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Aegle marmelos (L.) (Rutaceae) {{commonly}} known as bael is an important medicinal fruit tree. The present study focused {{on the effects of}} aqueous extract of Aegle marmelos (AEAM) on the testis and sperm characteristics induced by cyclophosphamide (CPA) in mice. Thirty six adult Parke’s strain mice were divided into six groups: group I given only distilled water (control); group II administered with AEAM alone <b>once</b> in <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> five weeks; group III administered with CPA (200 mg/kg b. w., intraperitoneally) <b>once</b> in <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> five <b>weeks</b> and group IV-VI CPA along with AEAM (400, 500 and 600 mg/kg b. w., orally). CPA was found to reduce gonadosomatic index (GSI), sperm counts, motility, viability, antioxidant activities and induced histopathological changes of testis. In the group administered AEAM with CPA an exacerbation of sperm count, motility and viability of the cauda epididymis, GSI, antioxidant activities and architecture of testis was observed. The results suggest that the administration of AEAM may aggravate CPA-induced reproductive toxicity. It may be helpful in preparation of natural male contraceptives...|$|R

2500|$|Bulimia nervosa can be {{difficult}} to detect, compared to anorexia nervosa, because bulimics tend to be of average or slightly above or below average weight. Many bulimics may also engage in significantly disordered eating and exercise patterns without meeting the full diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa. Recently, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders was revised, which resulted in the loosening of criteria regarding the diagnoses of bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. [...] The diagnostic criteria utilized by the DSM-5 includes repetitive episodes of binge eating (a discrete episode of overeating during which the individual feels out of control of consumption) compensated for by excessive or inappropriate measures taken to avoid gaining weight. The diagnosis also requires the episodes of compensatory behaviors and binge eating to happen a minimum of <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>for</b> a consistent time period of 3 months. The diagnosis is made only when the behavior is {{not a part of the}} symptom complex of anorexia nervosa and when the behavior reflects an overemphasis on physical mass or appearance.
