We all leave school unable to drive! Now that would be quite handy.|$|E
5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> function in this city.|$|E

Kennedy was reported in The New York Times as saying, [...] "an injured, maimed, or dead child is a price that none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> afford to pay", although adding, [...] "I believe that everyone understands their just grievances must be resolved."

500|$|In August 1999, McCain's memoir Faith of My Fathers, co-authored with Mark Salter, was published; a {{reviewer}} {{observed that}} its appearance [...] "seems {{to have been}} timed to the unfolding Presidential campaign." [...] The most successful of his writings, it received positive reviews, became a bestseller, and was later made into a TV film. The book traces McCain's family background and childhood, covers his time at Annapolis and his service {{before and during the}} Vietnam War, concluding with his release from captivity in 1973. According to one reviewer, it describes [...] "the kind of challenges that most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> barely imagine. It's a fascinating history of a remarkable military family." ...|$|E
500|$|Delsin's Native American {{heritage}} {{came from}} the game's setting in the Pacific Northwest, which features a large Native American population. Delsin wears a beanie inspired by one that Harper would wear around the studio (Harper recounted one particular staff meeting where {{four of the six}} team members were wearing hats). Delsin's character was inspired by United Kingdom street artist Banksy, as the development team appreciated Banksy's clandestine, satirical work. Developing Delsin's personality, the team posited the hypothetical: [...] "What if Johnny Knoxville had powers? What would he do with it?". Harper considered Delsin [...] "full of reckless abandon", the kind of character that would, upon gaining superpowers, jump off a cliff to see what happens. Fox considered Delsin [...] "flawed in a way I think a lot <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> relate to", trying {{to live up to his}} successful brother Reggie. He called the game's story a [...] "hero's journey".|$|E

Nevertheless, Halifax pulled away with the 125–91 victory, putting them one win away from the title. Rainmen forward Forrest Fisher complained about Windsor, [...] "They're playing very physical, and at times a little bit dirty with sucker punches, and we started playing into their game (Friday) and that's not us. A couple <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> play like that, myself included, and we came out tonight and I told them 'hey, let me take the hits, I'm used to that. You guys play your normal game.' We play the way we play, and it doesn't matter how they play." [...] According to The Chronicle Herald, [...] "the game featured several incidents that threatened to escalate into a full-scale brawl." [...] The teams' coaches would frequently have to break up skirmishes and confront officials for what they felt were bad calls.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by Paul Fedor was filmed between October 31 and November 1, 2006. During {{an interview with}} MTV News, Lee said, [...] "There's the me in all white and it's really wintry, and then there's the all-in-black Amy {{under the surface of}} the water of this lake in the forest. So it's the happiness and the sorrow and we're almost singing to each other, trying to figure out how both <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> work." [...] She added that the video was not [...] "so-in-your-face" [...] in order to be made more literal, but expressed her opinion that it's [...] "all about touching somebody and I hope it does that". For the video, fake snow and trees were used along with various other objects which according to the video's scenic coordinator, were supposed to create a [...] "frozen, gothic, cemetery feel". For the scenes filmed in water, a hydraulic lift was used with which Lee could easily sink and the lake water was colored black.|$|E
500|$|The Ludys {{argue that}} one's love {{life should be}} both guided by and {{subordinate}} to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, [...] "if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry... is alive and wandering the earth" [...] and that this knowledge should encourage people to act {{in such a way}} that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others... our deepest needs are met as well!" ...|$|E

500|$|Dream Days at the Hotel Existence was {{recorded}} at Sunset Sound Studio, Los Angeles, California, in early 2007 by producer Rob Schnapf, {{best known for}} his work with Beck and The Vines. Powderfinger had already written most of the album before departing to the United States. In particular, Powderfinger wrote songs in parts and brought them together; some songs were written in pairs or trios, while others were written in parts by different people, and then combined. According to the band, this brought a [...] "diverse" [...] and [...] "fresh" [...] approach to songwriting. The band used different methods in putting the album together as [...] "it comes back to the sound the five <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> make together". Powderfinger guitarist Darren Middleton commented that as a rule they preferred not to put together an album that was just [...] "plain". As the style of writing differed, the band identified the need for piano performances in many of their songs, enlisting veteran pianist Benmont Tench to play parts throughout.|$|E
500|$|Alec Mapa of The Advocate elaborates: [...] "While {{the rest}} of us were sleeping, Cher's been out there for the last four decades living out every single one of our {{childhood}} fantasies... Cher embodies an unapologetic freedom and fearlessness that some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> only aspire to." [...] Rolling Stone Jancee Dunn wrote, [...] "Cher is the coolest woman who ever stood in shoes. Why? Because her motto is, 'I don't give a shit what you think, I'm going to wear this multicolored wig.' There are folks all over America who would, in their heart of hearts, love to date people half their age, get multiple tattoos and wear feathered headdresses. Cher does it for us." [...] Alexander Fury of The Independent wrote that Cher [...] "represents a seemingly immortal, omnipotent, uni-monikered level of fame." [...] Bego stated: [...] "No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's. She has been a teenage pop star, a television hostess, a fashion magazine model, a rock star, a pop singer, a Broadway actress, an Academy Award-winning movie star, a disco sensation, and the subject of a mountain of press coverage." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the course}} of the show, Val was often played up as the good girl character. When asked about whether Val was a weak character, Van Ark said: [...] "God, no. No she wasn’t. For the very reason that she went through so much and landed on both feet. She was strong in a {{realistic}} kind of way. I do remember that TV Guide did a quote that the three <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> be compared to Earth, Wind and Fire. Michele was the Earth, I was the Wind and Donna was the Fire. I think that really captured it." [...] Van Ark was later asked about who she saw Val as today. She said, [...] "Of course the dysfunctional elements would come out. Why even bother otherwise? But of course they would persevere and still be together after all. I think Valene was headed to, and my sister’s like this, after years of doing everything for her husband and her children, Valene was going to further her achievements in the professional world. I think if you saw Valene today she’d be much more accomplished as a writer and would be very successful overall." [...] The actress also said: ...|$|E

500|$|A {{review in}} Publishers Weekly called the book an [...] "exuberant parade of pork fat", and commented, [...] "there's plenty {{good to be}} had in these pages". Writing for Library Journal, Judith Sutton concluded, [...] "There are, in fact, several other cookbooks devoted to bacon, {{including}} Sara Perry's Everything Tastes Better with Bacon, but with its irresistible recipes and wealth of information and lore, Villas's new title is recommended for most collections." [...] Amy Culbertson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram also compared the Villas's work to another book on bacon, writing, [...] "His is a more definitive cookbook than last year's [...] "Seduced by Bacon" [...] by Joanna Pruess". The book was highlighted in the [...] "Holiday Cookbook Roundup: Gift Guide" [...] column of The Austin Chronicle, where writer Mick Vann concluded, [...] "This {{is one of the}} few cookbooks you'll find where every single recipe makes you want to head straight for the stove, whether it's a bacon, goat cheese, and sweet-onion pie; Russian borscht; beef-stuffed plantains; or braised Japanese pork belly. For those fellow bacon lovers in our midst, Villas' The Bacon Cookbook is required reading." [...] In honor of International Bacon Day in 2009, the National Pork Board offered recipes from The Bacon Cookbook. Bonnie Stern of Financial Post recommended the book, and commented, [...] "Few <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> resist the allure of sizzling, smokey, crispy bacon. Though not usually high on the list of foods that are considered good for you, if you don't eat it often, you can have your bacon and eat it, too. If you want to know all about bacon, have a look at The Bacon Cookbook by James Villas".|$|E
500|$|It's {{human nature}} to look to {{external}} forces when faced with our own inadequacies but the ethicist is against this. Comparison is an esthetic exercise and {{has nothing to do}} with ethics and religion. He says, [...] "Let each one learn what he can; both <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> learn that a person’s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this would only make him completely unhappy." [...] He also asks if a person [...] "absolutely in love can know if he is more or less in love than others." [...] He completes this thought later in his Concluding Unscientific Postscript and expands on looking inward in Practice in Christianity.The ethical and the ethical-religious have nothing to do with the comparative. … All comparison delays, and that is why mediocrity likes it so much and, if possible, traps everyone in it by its despicable friendship among mediocrities. A person who blames others, that they have corrupted him, is talking nonsense and only informs against himself. Concluding Unscientific Postscript p. 549-550Comparison is the most disastrous association that love can enter into; comparison is the most dangerous acquaintance love can make; comparison is the worst of all seductions. Søren Kierkegaard, Works of Love (1847), Hong, p. 186 Lord Jesus Christ, our foolish minds are weak; they are more than willing to be drawn-and there is so much that wants to draw us to itself. There is pleasure with its seductive power, the multiplicity with its bewildering distractions, the moment with its infatuating importance and the conceited laboriousness of busyness and the careless time-wasting of light-mindedness and the gloomy brooding of heavy-mindedness-all this will draw us away from ourselves to itself in order to deceive us. [...] But you, who are the truth, only you, Savior and Redeemer, can truly draw a person to yourself, which you have promised to do-that you will draw all to yourself. Then may God grant that by repenting we may come to ourselves, so that you, according to your Word, can draw us to yourself-from on high, but through lowliness and abasement.
