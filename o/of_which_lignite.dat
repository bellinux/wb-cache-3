40|$|A high {{pressure}} supercritical CO geochemical reactor {{was used to}} simulate the CO sequestration process into deep coal seam under around 40 °C and 9. 8 MPa for 72 hours. The changes of pore structure of different rank coal samples with and without the supercritical CO treatment were investigated by helium pycnometer and mercury porosimetry. The {{results show that the}} true density of anthracite increase from 1. 51 g/cm to 1. 59 g/cm while that of other rank samples have no significant changes after being treated by the HP-ScCO-HO system. All the bulk densities decrease, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>lignite</b> and low volatile bituminous decreased by 0. 1 g/cm. The growth rate of total pore volume and porosity of lignite are 85 % and 118 % respectively, which are mainly attributed to the increase in macropores. Pore structures of coal during CO sequestration are mainly influenced by macropores and mesopores in low rank coals, while in high rank coals mainly by micropores, which increase the surface area of coal. As shown in anthracite, the surface area increase from 24. 3 m/g to 27. 6 m/g, which accordingly enhance the gas adsorption. The "ink-bottle" pores are influenced during CO sequestration process from analysis on hysteresis of the extrusion curves...|$|E

Lignite represents geologically the youngest type of coal, and belongs to kaustobiolites, which are masses {{with varying degrees of}} carbonification of the original phytomass. The degree of carbonification is roughly between peat and brown coal. Particular attention was paid to the application of lignite as a cheaper and more versatile sorbent to replace activated carbon and for the use of sorption of biologically active substances in biotechnology. The specific structure and composition give the lignite the natural sorption capability. In model experiments, polyphenols were used as significant microbial inhibitors for <b>which</b> <b>lignite</b> had a high sorption and for glucose, <b>which</b> <b>lignite</b> practically did not absorb.

Today Kosovo wastes 30% of available energy due to energy efficiency, 37% due to technical losses, the outdated electrical grid and other commercial losses, such as theft. A study by Dr. Daniel Kammen shows that [...] "Kosovo can cover 38% of its energy consumption from renewable sources". He also specified that this scenario, without including the Kosova e Re power plant, would create 27% more jobs than current scenarios.

30|$|The {{products}} of biosolubilization are {{a mixture of}} humic, fulvic acids and other organic compounds. The chemical structure of the products enables their usage as excellent sorbents, for example in biosorption of various pollutants, especially heavy metals.

Brown coal has been proposed before as fertilizer and a component in soil remediation process (Sekhohola et al. 2013). Furthermore, high content of organic substances suggests application of liquefied coal in production of methane. The process of biosolubilization may be an initial step for methanogenesis.

Beyond the primary need to develop technically and economically reliable procedures for the extraction of humic substances from compost at the industrial scale, importance must be placed on controlling the influence of such compounds on soil-plant systems. Humates from leonardite, representative of the active agents among humus-based commercial preparations, have been compared in pot trials with humic acids, potassium salts, from green compost in order to evaluate their respective effects on soil microbial activity and plant productivity. Differences between pot blocks amended with humic acids have suggested that humus-like substances extracted from compost seem to exert higher stimulative effects on microbial growth and vegetative biomass production than fossil humates...|$|R
