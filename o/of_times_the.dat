5|$|Before the promotion's purchase, {{the final}} champions {{recognized}} by WCW were Sean O' Haire and Chuck Palumbo; {{they were also}} the first champions under the titles operation in the WWF. On November 18, 2001, the championship was deactivated after its use in the Invasion storyline. The title was unified with the WWF Tag Team Championship, and the final champions recognized by the WWF, were The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von). The title was won in Australia, Canada, Germany, and the United States. Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) held the most reigns as a tag team (10), and Booker T held the most individual reigns (11), {{which is the same}} amount <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> title was vacated. At 282 days, Doom's reign during WCW's NWA withdrawal was the longest in the championship's history. Overall, there were 143 title reigns.|$|E

5|$|The 49th Pursuit Group {{was soon}} {{on its way}} to fight the Japanese in the South West Pacific. Arriving in Australia in February 1942, the 49th Pursuit Group moved to the Darwin area in March and April 1942. By this time, Darwin had been bombed a number <b>of</b> <b>times.</b> <b>The</b> 49th Pursuit Group became its {{principal}} defense. Conditions in the area were still primitive, and spare parts and equipment were scarce. Lacking adequate logistical support, the Americans were heavily dependent on their Australian allies.

5|$|The I Ching {{has been}} {{translated}} into Western languages dozens <b>of</b> <b>times.</b> <b>The</b> most influential edition is the 1923 German translation of Richard Wilhelm, later translated to English by Cary Baynes. The earliest complete published I Ching translation in a Western language was a Latin translation done in the 1730s by Jesuit missionary Jean-Baptiste Régis that was published in Germany in the 1830s. Although Thomas McClatchie and James Legge had both translated the text in the 19th century, the text gained significant traction during the counterculture of the 1960s, with the translations of Wilhelm and John Blofeld attracting particular interest. Richard Rutt's 1996 translation incorporated {{much of the new}} archaeological and philological discoveries of the 20th century. Gregory Whincup's 1986 translation also attempts to reconstruct Zhou period readings.|$|E
5|$|The classic {{point in}} polygon test from {{computational}} geometry applies the above ideas. To {{determine if a}} point lies within a polygon, one casts a ray from infinity to the point and counts the number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> ray crosses the edge of polygon. The crossing number is even {{if and only if}} the point is outside the polygon. This algorithm works because if the ray never crosses the polygon, then its crossing number is zero, which is even, and the point is outside. Every time the ray does cross the polygon, the crossing number alternates between even and odd, and the point at its tip alternates between outside and inside.|$|E

5|$|The initial Windows {{release was}} criticized by players for several {{perceived}} shortcomings. The game was shipped with SecuROM copy protection that required activation from 2K Games' servers over the Internet; the unavailability of these servers was reported {{as the reason}} for the cancellation of the game's midnight release in Australia. Players found that the SecuROM limited the number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> game could be activated to two; user feedback led to 2K Games to increase the activation count to five, and later offer a tool that allowed users to revoke previous activations on their own. Ultimately 2K Games removed the activation limit, though retail versions of the game still required the activation process. Levine admitted that their initial approach to the activation process was malformed, harming their reputation during the launch period.|$|E
5|$|The inner {{boundary}} of the debris disk was estimated at 11″±2″, or 70–100AU. The disk of dust is produced as radiation pressure from Vega pushes debris from collisions of larger objects outward. However, continuous production {{of the amount of}} dust observed over the course of Vega's lifetime would require an enormous starting mass—estimated as hundreds <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> mass of Jupiter. Hence it is {{more likely to have been}} produced as the result of a relatively recent breakup of a moderate-sized (or larger) comet or asteroid, which then further fragmented as the result of collisions between the smaller components and other bodies. This dusty disk would be relatively young on the time scale of the star's age, and it will eventually be removed unless other collision events supply more dust.|$|E

5|$|The {{morning of}} 16 August was {{relatively}} quiet, {{with only a}} few attempts made by small German parties to approach the Canadian lines. After having failed to capture all their objectives the previous day and having postponed additional attacks a number <b>of</b> <b>times,</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Canadian Brigade attacked and captured the remainder of its final objective line on the afternoon of 16 August. The assault lasted a little over an hour but the troops were then forced to defend against a dozen German counter-attacks during the day.|$|E
5|$|Battle Mountain {{changed hands}} so often during August {{that there is}} no {{agreement}} on the exact number <b>of</b> <b>times.</b> <b>The</b> intelligence sergeant of the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry estimated the peak changed hands 19 times. From August 18 {{to the end of the}} month, North Korean troops attacked the mountain every night. The peak often changed hands two or three times in a 24-hour period. The usual pattern was for the North Koreans to take it at night and the US 24th Infantry to recapture it the next day. This type of fluctuating battle resulted in relatively high losses among artillery forward observers and their equipment. During the period of August 15–31, seven forward observers and eight other members of the Observer and Liaison Section of the 159th Field Artillery Battalion were casualties, and they lost eight radios, 11 telephones, and two vehicles in the process.|$|E

5|$|If one removes from a 1-tree one of {{the edges}} in its cycle, {{the result is a}} tree. Reversing this process, if one augments a tree by {{connecting}} any two of its vertices by a new edge, the result is a 1-tree; the path in the tree connecting the two endpoints of the added edge, together with the added edge itself, form the 1-tree's unique cycle. If one augments a 1-tree by adding an edge that connects one of its vertices to a newly added vertex, the result is again a 1-tree, with one more vertex; an alternative method for constructing 1-trees is to start with a single cycle and then repeat this augmentation operation any number <b>of</b> <b>times.</b> <b>The</b> edges of any 1-tree can be partitioned in a unique way into two subgraphs, one of which is a cycle and the other of which is a forest, such that each tree of the forest contains exactly one vertex of the cycle.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{possible}} to rule out many explanations of the observed divergences in the masses of the world's prototypes proposed by scientists and the general public. The BIPM's FAQ explains, for example, that the divergence {{is dependent on the}} amount of time elapsed between measurements and not dependent on the number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> artifacts have been cleaned or possible changes in gravity or environment. Reports published in 2013 by Peter Cumpson of Newcastle University based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of samples that were stored alongside various prototype kilograms suggested that one source of the divergence between the various prototypes could be traced to mercury that had been absorbed by the prototypes being in the proximity of mercury-based instruments. The IPK has been stored within centimetres of a mercury thermometer since at least {{as far back as the}} late 1980s. In this Newcastle University work six platinum weights made in the nineteenth century were all found to have mercury at the surface, the most contaminated of which had the equivalent of 250µg of mercury when scaled to the surface area of a kilogram prototype.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the filming}} was completed, more than 20 two-hour Beta SP video tapes of footage {{had to be}} edited down to fit {{the actions of the}} game. The {{programming}} included editing the original video footage, and mixing the rendered images of doors, drawers, chairs and other objects into the footage frame-by-frame, which was necessary for more than 100 scenes. The game required more polishing and fine-tuning than most games of its time due to the many video components, and the programmers had to determine the desired frame rate, data transfer rate and desired resolution of the video elements. Another challenge for the game was CD resource management. Since many of the scenes in the game could be repeated in multiple chapters, some pieces of the code were written onto several different CDs to reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> player had to swap discs {{in the middle of a}} chapter, an unusual practice for computer games at the time. The final game was on seven discs, a large number for a computer game, and more than the four or five discs originally expected.|$|E

5|$|The {{generalized}} Euclidean algorithm {{requires a}} Euclidean function, i.e., a mapping f from R into {{the set of}} nonnegative integers such that, for any two nonzero elements a and b in R, there exist q and r in R such that a = qb + r and f(r) < f(b). An example of this mapping is the norm function used to order the Gaussian integers above. The function f can be {{the magnitude of the}} number, or the degree of a polynomial. The basic principle is that each step of the algorithm reduces f inexorably; hence, if f can be reduced only a finite number <b>of</b> <b>times,</b> <b>the</b> algorithm must stop in a finite number of steps. This principle relies heavily on the natural well-ordering of the non-negative integers; roughly speaking, this requires that every non-empty set of non-negative integers has a smallest member.|$|E
5|$|When {{taking an}} audition, a judge evaluates the idol over a 30-second period. The judge's {{interest}} level continuously decreases in 10% increments, but {{this can be}} increased with another minigame. The heart points obtained up to the audition {{are used in the}} minigame as the number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>the</b> player is given to successfully appeal to the judge until all the points are exhausted. For instance, three heart points indicates the player will have three chances to increase a judge's interest level. At the end of the audition, a judge's interest level determines if the idol passes or not. If an idol passes the audition, he or she is chosen to do a televised performance of the song previously chosen. A performance serves to increase an idol's number of fans, which in turn can increase an idol's rank if enough fans have been obtained for a given rank. For example, an idol starts at rank F with below 10,000 fans, and the next level up is a rank E with between 10,001 and 99,999 fans. The ranks continue from D to C, B, A and finally S.|$|E
