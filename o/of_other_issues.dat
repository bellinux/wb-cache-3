Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.|$|E
5|$|Burnell was {{the chief}} and most {{influential}} of Edward I's advisers {{during the first half}} of his reign. As part of his duties Burnell spent most of his time in attendance on the king. He heard many requests and petitions from those who desired patronage or other advancements, and was diligent and active in dealing with routine business. Burnell played a leading role in the legislation introduced by King Edward. The king's major legislative acts mainly date to Burnell's tenure of the office of chancellor, from 21 September 1274 until Burnell's death in 1292. Burnell was instrumental in the enforcement of royal writs and enactments, including the Statutes of Westminster, enacted in 1275, 1285, and 1290. Those of 1275 attempted to deal with the usurpation of royal rights. Keeping the peace in the realm and the extension of royal jurisdiction to cover rape was dealt with in the statutes from 1285, along with a number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>issues.</b> The last statute, from 1290, regulated land law, the result of pressure from the magnates, the leading laymen of England.|$|E

Its signing is also closely linked with the efforts to create peace between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) representing the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). It was signed at the southern border crossing of Arabah on 26 October 1994 and made Jordan only the second Arab country (after Egypt) to sign a peace accord with Israel.|$|E

25|$|In 1956, for example, the moetzes {{issued a}} written ruling forbidding Orthodox rabbis {{to join with}} any Reform or Conservative rabbis in rabbinical {{communal}} professional organizations that then united the various branches of America's Jews, such as the Synagogue Council of America. This position was not endorsed by the Modern Orthodox. Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik of Yeshiva University had initially aligned himself with Agudah, but later established his independent views on these matters and a host <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>issues,</b> such as attitudes towards college education and attitudes towards the secular-led Israeli governments. Rabbi Soloveitchik felt it important to nurture the modern Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America (RCA).

25|$|The United States generates about 18% of its {{electricity}} from nuclear power plants. Nuclear engineers {{in this field}} generally work, directly or indirectly, in the nuclear power industry or for national laboratories. Current research in the industry is directed at producing economical, proliferation-resistant reactor designs with passive safety features. Some government labs research the same areas as industry, they also study a myriad <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>issues</b> such as nuclear fuels and nuclear fuel cycles, advanced reactor designs, and nuclear weapon design and maintenance. A principal pipeline for trained personnel for US reactor facilities is the Navy Nuclear Power Program. The job outlook for nuclear engineering from the year 2012 to the year 2022 is predicted to grow 9% due to many elder nuclear engineers retiring, safety systems needing to be updated in power plants, and the advancements made in nuclear medicine.|$|E

25|$|While few {{societies}} have recognized same-sex unions as marriages, {{the historical and}} anthropological record reveals a large range of attitudes towards same-sex unions ranging from praise, through full acceptance and integration, sympathetic toleration, indifference, prohibition and discrimination, to persecution and physical annihilation. Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that same-sex marriage, while doing good for the couples that participate in them and the children they are raising, undermines a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father. Some supporters of same-sex marriages take {{the view that the}} government should have no role in regulating personal relationships, while others argue that same-sex marriages would provide social benefits to same-sex couples. The debate regarding same-sex marriages includes debate based upon social viewpoints as well as debate based on majority rules, religious convictions, economic arguments, health-related concerns, and a variety <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>issues.</b>|$|E

In the spring of 1831, Van Buren helped end the Petticoat affair by offering to resign as Secretary of State.

500|$|News of the Tea Act {{set off a}} {{firestorm}} of protest in the colonies. This was not a dispute about high taxes; the price of legally imported tea was actually reduced by the Tea Act.

Some colonists worried that, by buying the cheaper tea, they would be conceding that Parliament had the right to tax them. The [...] "power of the purse" [...] conflict was still at issue. The tea tax revenues were to be used to pay the salaries of certain royal officials, making them independent of the people.
