50|$|The {{origins of}} the Haulpak line began with the {{purchase}} of R. G. LeTourneau's construction machinery business in 1953 by Westinghouse Air Brake Company. Wabco had traditionally been a manufacturer of railway air brake systems, but ventured into construction machinery with the purchase of LeRoi air tools and industrial drills in 1952. The subsequent purchase of R. G. LeTourneau's construction machinery line gave Wabco a comprehensive range of machinery including scrapers, rubber-tyred dozers and other attachments. Wabco subsequently added motor graders to their product line by purchasing J.D. Adams in 1955 and thereafter front end loaders, with the purchase of Scoopmobile. Wabco recognised {{the importance of the}} <b>off-highway</b> <b>Truck</b> market and hired Ralph H. Kress to design a line of haul trucks in-house. Kress incorporated many new design features which were trend setting and eventually Caterpillar was to offer him a position designing their range of haulers.|$|E

The console is interfaced with the workstation through an IBM-PC in which the operator's commands were digitized and sent through an RS- 232 serial port. The simulation gave visual feedback adequate for the operator in the loop, with the camera's field of vision projected on a large screen in multiple view windows. The view control can emulate either stationary or moving cameras. This simulator created an innovative engineering design environment by integrating computer software and hardware with the human operator's interactions. The backhoe simulation has been adopted by Caterpillar in building a virtual reality tool for backhoe design...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Army Topographic Engineering Center (TEC) and Caterpillar Inc. have cooperated in {{the joint}} {{research}} and development of a system to position, track, and maneuver construction and other equipment during their normal construction activities. The two main components of this research focus are the positioning system needed for navigation and the Computer Aided Drafting and Design (CADD) interface for automation. The positioning system is based on software developed by TEC that utilizes the Global Positioning System (GPS). It is called the On-the-Fly (OTF) Differential GPS system. Several repeatability tests were conducted to test the accuracy and precision of the OTF software. The results proved that the OTF system can provide an accuracy of 3 centimeters in a robust manner. The positioning system software has been integrated with Caterpillar developed software tools to automate construction activities and increase productivity and safety in the project area. This software allows the construction vehicle to perform its operations and provide real time as-built drawings in the process. This joint effort has produced an autonomous construction vehicle navigation and automation system that has been demonstrated on a Track-Type Tractor (dozer) and will be adapted to various other construction vehicle platforms, which include an <b>off-highway</b> <b>truck</b> and a motor grader.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} ongoing {{research at}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Spokane Research Laboratory, in which collision warning systems for surface mining dump trucks are being evaluated. Common accidents involve these large trucks running over smaller vehicles or pedestrian workers. Collision warning systems currently use one of several methods, including radar, radio-frequency-signal detection, or ultrasonic signals, to detect and warn {{of the presence of}} an object or person in the blind spots of the mining equipment. Most available systems have not been tested on large <b>off-highway</b> dump <b>trucks.</b> This report evaluates several systems on two sizes of trucks, a 50 -ton-capacity truck commonly used in quarries and construction and a 240 -ton-capacity truck commonly used in open-pit mines. Tests were conducted to determine false alarm rates, alarm effectiveness, and reliable detection zones for a person and a pickup truck. The results indicate that radar and radiofrequency identification systems show promise for this application and that several of the improved systems are ready for extensive field tests.

40|$|The lack of {{visibility}} near {{earthmoving equipment}} resulted in six fatalities in U. S. surface mining operations during 2003. These accidents {{were the result}} of either a piece of equipment striking another vehicle or worker, or the equipment traveling over the edge of an embankment. Figure 1 {{is an example of a}} recent accident that resulted in serious injuries to one worker and fatal injuries to two others when a van parked in front of a haul truck. Two fatalities occurred in separate incidents when front-end loaders struck workers. Another two workers were killed when their equipment backed over the edge of a highwall or dump point [1]. There is clearly a need to provide better information to equipment operators regarding their surroundings. [] Researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Spokane Research Laboratory, are working to reduce these accidents by developing systems that sense obstacles and changes in terrain near the equipment and provide this information to the operator. Many off-the-shelf proximity warning systems that were developed for automobiles, light trucks, and recreational vehicles were evaluated on <b>off-highway</b> dump <b>trucks</b> [2]. Many limitations were found with existing systems, including frequent false alarms, limited detection range, a lack of specific information on an obstacle (e. g., location, identity), difficulties in finding suitable mounting locations, and an inability to withstand the environment. These limitations have necessitated the development of new systems designed specifically for large, off-highway, earthmoving equipment. New off-the-shelf systems available for mining equipment include radar and tag-based detection systems. Prototype systems now being developed include a proximity warning system based on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and a computer-assisted stereovision system. Development of these new systems was accomplished by working with manufacturers to modify existing systems to meet the needs of surface mining and through cooperative research with organizations to develop completely new solutions. A typical proximity warning system consists of a sensor or antenna mounted on the equipment that detects the presence of obstacles and an alarm interface in the cab of the equipment. Some systems, as described in more detail below, also require that other vehicles and personnel on the ground be outfitted with electronic tags that transmit an I m here signal back to the system (e. g., radio signal detection systems or GPS). Many types of proximity warning systems are on the market, but they are not all discussed in this paper. APPROACH In past work, engineers at NIOSH evaluated several off-the-shelf proximity warning technologies in order to verify their effectiveness on <b>off-highway</b> dump <b>trucks</b> [2]. Dump trucks were chosen because of the number and severity of accidents involving this type of equipment and because extensive blind areas around these trucks are typical. This experience allowed engineers to limit the number of systems chosen for long-term tests at mine sites to those systems showin...|$|R
40|$|Problem: An {{average of}} three workers {{a year are}} killed in surface mining {{operations}} when a piece of haulage equipment collides with another smaller vehicle or a worker on foot. Another three workers are killed each year when haulage equipment backs {{over the edge of}} a dump point or stockpile. Devices to monitor the blind areas of mining equipment are needed to provide a warning to operators when a vehicle, person, or change in terrain is near the equipment. Method: A proximity warning system (PWS) based on the global positioning system (GPS) and peer-to-peer communication has been developed to prevent collisions between mining equipment, small vehicles, and stationary structures. Results: A final system was demonstrated using one <b>off-highway</b> haul <b>truck,</b> three smaller vehicles, and various stationary structures at a surface mining operation. The system successfully displayed the location of nearby vehicles and stationary structures and provided visual and audible warnings to the equipment operator when they were within a preset distance. Summary: Many surface mining operations already use GPS technology on their mobile equipment for tracking and dispatch. Our tests have shown that it is feasible to add proximity warning to these existing systems as a safety feature. Larger scale and long-term tests are needed to prove the technology adequately. Impact on Industry: A PWSs that incorporates a combination of technologies could significantly reduce accidents that involve collisions or driving over an edge at surface mining operations...|$|R
