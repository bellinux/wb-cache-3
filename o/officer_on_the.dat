5|$|Apart {{from a few}} {{inscriptions}} and fragments, texts {{written by}} people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander were all lost. Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander's campaign historian Callisthenes; Alexander's generals Ptolemy and Nearchus; Aristobulus, a junior <b>officer</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman. Their works are lost, but later works based on these original sources have survived. The earliest of these is Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus (mid-to-late 1st century AD), Arrian (1st to 2nd century AD), the biographer Plutarch (1st to 2nd century AD), and finally Justin, whose work dated {{as late as the}} 4th century. Of these, Arrian is generally considered the most reliable, given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources, closely followed by Diodorus.|$|E
5|$|As chief {{engineer}} to the Military Division of the Pacific, {{he was the}} top U.S. Army Corps of Engineers <b>officer</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> entire American Pacific Coast. Upon his arrival on the West Coast, he visited locations from Alaska to the Mexican border in order to analyze the work that would be needed. Between 1868 and 1870, he surveyed numerous California harbors and made engineering suggestions as required. One of these suggestions resulted {{in the construction of}} a 7,000-foot breakwater that made Long Beach harbor accessible to large amounts of shipping for the first time. In 1870, he suggested that landowners near Colusa, California, construct levees to contain the Sacramento River within a single channel. The plan would reclaim swampland and control the river's annual floods, making large-scale farming possible. The plan was eagerly seized upon by local residents.|$|E

F/O Tongue {{was a member of}} the RAF, had been commissioned from sergeant and promoted to flying <b>officer.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> night he won the bar to his DFC, on 25 November 1944, his pilot was A. A. Harrington of the United States Army Air Forces. They destroyed three Junkers Ju 88s, their own Mosquito having been hit by debris from the second Ju 88, and during the fight that led to the downing of the third, Tongue was also having to keep track of a further Ju 88 which was endeavouring to attack their aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Greene's wife Martha died in 1883 {{at an age}} of 74. Their oldest son, Lieutenant Samuel Dana Greene, was the {{executive}} <b>officer</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ironclad ship USS Monitor during the Battle of Hampton Roads. Another of their sons, Francis V. Greene, commanded a brigade at the Battle of Manila during the Spanish–American War. A third, Charles Thurston Greene, was a lieutenant on his father's staff at Culp's Hill. Later in 1863, Charles was wounded by an artillery shell and his leg was amputated, but he remained on active service until 1870. George Sears Greene, Jr., volunteered to serve but {{was not allowed to}} do so by his father so he could survive and carry on the family name.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} to make minor appearances in television throughout the 1980s; in 1987, he auditioned {{for the role of}} Dave Lister in the BBC North science fiction sitcom Red Dwarf. The part eventually went to Craig Charles but Bathurst was given a role in the first episode of the first series as Frank Todhunter, second <b>officer</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship, who is killed in the first ten minutes. Ten years later, Bathurst was invited to reprise the role when a storyline in the series allowed former characters to return, but filming commitments prevented him from appearing. In 1989, he appeared in Malcolm Bradbury's Anything More Would Be Greedy for Anglia Television, playing Dennis Medlam, MP. The programme was broadcast in 1990 to little fanfare. In 1990, he performed on Up Yer News, a live topical programme broadcast on BSB.|$|E

50|$|This {{legislation}} has been reproduced in the Revised Statutes, where <b>the</b> distinction between <b>officers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> retired list and <b>officers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> retired list <b>on</b> furlough pay is preserved. Thus, §§ 1588 and 1592 prescribe one {{rate of pay}} for retired officers, and § 1593 a different rate for <b>officers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> retired list <b>on</b> furlough pay, and § 1594 authorizes the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to transfer any <b>officer</b> of <b>the</b> navy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> retired list from the furlough to the retired pay list. It is plain, therefore, that section 5 of the Act of July 15, 1870, relied on by appellant and {{which is the only}} one which refers to the pay of retired officers, applies in both its terms and meaning only to <b>the</b> pay of <b>officers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> retired list, and not to the compensation of <b>officers</b> retired <b>on</b> furlough pay, to which class Brown belonged, and did not abolish the furlough pay list. The order of the President retiring Brown on furlough pay was therefore made strictly in accordance with the provisions of the statute then and still in force.|$|R
