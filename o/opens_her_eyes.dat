5|$|Book Nine, Nsara, {{follows the}} life of a young Muslim woman named Budur and her aunt Idelba in Europe, in the {{aftermath}} of the Long War. Budur's family is highly traditional and as there are not enough men left after the war for marriage prospects, she is forced to live in seclusion with her female cousins in the family's compound in Turi, a city in one of the Alpine Emirates. Idelba is an educated woman and was involved in physics research in Firanja before her husband's death, she is just as unhappy in Turi as Budur and wishes to return to her former work. One night, Idelba escapes and Budur follows her. Together they leave {{the life of}} captivity in the Alps and move to the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Nsara (Saint-Nazaire in France). There they stay at a zawiyya, a refuge for women, Idelba restarts her work in physics and Budur enrols in university where she studies history. The history class is presided over by Kirana, a radical feminist lecturer who questions everything about Muslim society. Budur becomes close to Kirana who <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to the injustices that women face and how they can seek emancipation and liberation (the two have a brief affair). Life at the university allows for open debate about all issues and Kirana focuses on the nature of history and contemporary events, such as the Muslim defeat in the Long War, which she blames on the failure of the Islamic countries to properly mobilize women for the war effort (something which the Chinese did almost totally). There is also a newfound interest in ancient history as the field of archaeology is taking off (theories about how and why the plague killed off the Europeans centuries before are a popular topic).|$|E

500|$|The {{miscarriage}} leaves Steffy devastated and {{she decides}} to leave town, ending her marriage to Liam. Wood noted that [...] "Steffy was so set on she really messed this up" [...] and noticed that Liam still had feelings for Hope. Speaking of the miscarriage {{and the end of}} Liam and Steffy's marriage, Wood explained: [...] "She is obviously trying a reason to get out of it. In her heart and soul, she wants to be with him. She felt he was her soulmate, but with everything that has happened, she feels it was her fault and she can't change that. She should never have gotten on that motorcycle and he told her not to. There have been so many things that happened that it <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to the possibility that maybe he should be with Hope." [...] Upon Steffy's brief return to the show in 2015, she realizes that she still loves Liam, despite believing that these feelings were gone. Wood explained [...] "They lost a child together, so they’ll always have that emotional connection." [...] Despite liking the fact that Steffy [...] "speaks up" [...] and [...] "fights for love", Wood said that she wanted [...] "to see someone come in and sweep her off her feet and take that pain away", not wanting her to fight for [...] "a man that flip flops". However, Liam is involved with Steffy's cousin Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer) and Steffy does not win him back. Wood noted that [...] "in Steffy's mind, Ivy is just some new woman in town and Liam is fair game. He and Ivy have no history." [...] Eventually Liam breaks up with Ivy and after Steffy's marriage to Wyatt breaks down, Steffy and Liam rekindle their love and romance and they marry each other again for the third time.|$|E

Who among you all stood alone in refusing to believe that she was blind for life? I did! Who brought the man here who has given her back her sight? I brought the man! And I am the one person who is to be left in ignorance of how it ends. The others are to be present: I am to be sent away. The others are to see it: I am to hear by post (if any of you think of writing to me) what she does, what she says, how she looks, at the first heavenly moment when she <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on the world." [...] He flung up his hand in the air, and burst out savagely with a bitter laugh. [...] "I astonish you, don't I? I am {{claiming}} a position which I have no right to occupy.

He tore at the breast of his coat as if he was suffocating--and turned, and left me.|$|E
6000|$|Gradually Numerian's voice grew calmer. He {{raised his}} {{daughter}} in his arms, and bent wistfully {{on her face}} his attentive and pitying eyes. 'Returned, returned!' he murmured, while he gazed on her, 'never again to depart! Returned, beautiful and patient, kinder and more tender than ever! Love me and pardon me, Antonina. I sought for you in bitter loneliness and despair. Think not of me as what I was, but as what I am! There were days when you were an infant, when I had no thought but how to cherish and delight you, and now those days have come again. You shall read no gloomy task-books; you shall never be separated from me more; you shall play sweet music on the lute; you shall be all garlanded with flowers which I will provide for you! We will find friends and glad companions; we will bring happiness with us wherever we are seen. God's blessing goes forth from children like you--it has fallen upon me--it has raised me from the dead! My Antonina shall teach me to worship, as I once taught her. She shall pray {{for me in the}} morning, and pray for me at night; and when she thinks not of it, when she sleeps, I shall come softly to her bedside, and wait and watch over her, so that when she <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> they shall open on me--they are the eyes of my child who has been restored to me--there is nothing on earth that can speak to me like them of happiness and peace!' ...|$|E
