40|$|The {{transportation}} of oil {{represents one of}} the most strategically important movements of energy resources in the global economy (Rodrigue, 2004). However, shipping of crude oil between the Middle East and Europe and between the Middle East and the USA is moving through some of the world’s most pirate-infested waters, the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean being the most significant. This research project presents a study on the effect on operational cost of Somali piracy on crude oil shipping. The study quantifies the direct operational cost for <b>owners,</b> <b>charterers</b> and cargo <b>owners.</b> This includes ransoms, insurance premiums, security measures and rerouting of vessels. Creating an understanding of the operational impact that Somali piracy has on ship <b>owners,</b> <b>charterers</b> and cargo <b>owners</b> in the crude oil market is important for several reasons. • The global economy is highly dependent on oil (Green et. al., 2002). • The oil price and oil consumption are highly correlated with economic growth (Lee & Chiu. 2011) • Transport time has a significant impact when an oil importer selects export markets (Rodrigue, 2004). The operational cost of Somali piracy in this vital corridor for crude oil is thus important considerations when shaping government policies. For stakeholders such as oil companies, ship owners, cargo owners, and energy companies the quantification of the piracy-triggered cost is important in order to formulate appropriate strategies and operational practices (Fu et. al., 2010). The study area has been limited to crude oil shipping from the Middle East Gulf to Europe and to USA. The broader Middle East {{is the single most important}} oilproducing region in the world, while Europe and USA are major exporters and consumers (Rodrigue, 2004). IMO and IMB data have been thoroughly examined and sorted to establish a valid data sample of ship movements. Fixtures on the relevant route have also been thoroughly examined to establish commercial practices that can be relevant to include. Qualitative interviews with ship <b>owners</b> and <b>charterers</b> have been conducted and analysed. 5 This paper suggests that the piracy-triggered increase in direct economic cost to ship <b>owners,</b> <b>charterers</b> and cargo <b>owners</b> is significant. However it is hard to find an absolute quantification. Plymouth Business Schoo...|$|R

Dry Cargo shipping can, in general terms, be categorized by Vessel size: namely, Bulkers such as Capesizes, Panamaxes and Handysize.

40|$|The {{description}} of the tanker market {{is probably one of}} the most useful tools in the hands of all interested parties, such as ship <b>owners,</b> <b>charterers,</b> shipbrokers, etc. The most useful way to describe this market (and other markets as well) is to introduce a proper new index. The new index has two major advantages: It consists of a huge number of tanker routes (at least 37 tanker routes instead of only 10 for the BDTI), which gives a more representative sample of the world's dirty tanker market and it has ""dynamic"" characteristics. Hence, the introduction of the new index describes the dirty tanker market in a better way, compared to the Baltic Exchange's BDTI, since it embraces all those factors that have an influence to the market. Furthermore it uses a much bigger and consequently, more representative sample of the market, that makes the new index more reliable. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|R

40|$|The {{well-known}} German legal author H-J Puttfarken prefaces {{his remarks}} on the arrest of a vessel with the striking sentence "The arrest of a vessel is just {{as much a part}} of seafaring as distress, pirates and congested ports". Even if this comparison is doubtful since in opposition to an arrest, "distress, pirates and congested ports" are no legal institutes that are regulated by procedural rules. But the sentence shows the popularity of the maritime arrest, at least in the view of many ship owners, charters, etc. On the other hand the arrest of a vessel has now for ages often been the only possibility for debtors to realize a claim against ship <b>owners,</b> <b>charterers,</b> etc. The vessel, typically registered in some obscure legislation and cruising around in the world sea-lanes often constitutes the only valuable asset of a company, which itself is registered in some sunny island-state. This and much more makes the arrest of vessel so import for the world shipping business. This thesis aims on a comparison of two completely different legal systems one a mixture of different legal traditions and one a classical civil law jurisdiction. The thesis takes a practical approach to show differences and similarities that are relevant for the praxis. Thus the thesis does not focus a lot on the historical background, but rather shows the law and procedures how they are now.

Lawsuits brought for the breach of an obligation under a charter party are generally within the admiralty jurisdiction. As long as the agreement is executory, for inadequate performance the remedy is in personam which allows the plaintiff to go to state court under the [...] "saving to suitors" [...] clause.

Moreover the performance is only warranted during the specific conditions stated in the charter party which are not always clear. These usually refer to Beaufort Force (BF) and the Douglas Sea and Swell (DSS) scale which is archaic in the age of Numerical Weather Prediction. Given these conditions, the stage is set for conflict and there are often disputes over the weather conditions experienced. Moreover ships’ often do not arrive on time because the charterer has assumed that the ship will make good its warranted speed and not taken account of the forecast weather conditions.

5000|$|Voyage charter: The {{voyage charter}} {{is the most}} common charter in tramp shipping. [...] The owner of the tramp is obligated to provide a {{seaworthy}} ship while the charterer is obligated to provide a full load of cargo. [...] This type of charter is the most lucrative, but can be the riskiest due to lack of new charterers. During a voyage charter a part or all of a vessel is leased to the charterer for a voyage to a port or a set of different ports. There are two types of voyage charter - net form and gross form. [...] Under the net form, the cargo a tramp ship carries is loaded, discharged, and trimmed at the charterer's expense. Under the gross form the expense of cargo loading, discharging and trimming is on the <b>owner.</b> The <b>charterer</b> is only responsible to provide the cargo at a specified port and to accept it at the destination port. Time becomes an issue in the voyage charter if the tramp ship is late in her schedule or loading or discharging are delayed. If a tramp ship is delayed the charterer pays demurrage, which is a penalty, to the ship owner. The number of days a tramp ship is chartered for is called lay days.|$|R
40|$|A {{great deal}} of trouble is taken, by {{draftsman}} of voyage charterparties, to apportion risks of delay between <b>owners</b> and <b>charterers</b> at loading and discharge. Care must be taken over the commencement of laytime, {{the circumstances in which}} notice of readiness can be tendered, and exceptions and interruptions to laytime and demurrage. The complexities of demurrage alone have been judicially described as 'hideous': and no doubt the same sentiments can equally apply to laytime. This careful apportionment of delay risk can be entirely upset if the delay occurs before laytime is triggered. If charterers are held to have committed a breach of an independent term, preventing the laytime from running, damages will be for detention and neither layime nor demurrage provisions will be triggered. Charterers will lose the benefit of their laytime, and neither side will enjoy the convenience of the liquidated damages provided by the demurrage regime. This article considers two problems in this regard which could arise from recent decisions of the courts; first, the widening of safe port and safe berth obligations to encompass delay, and secondly, the implication of such terms into charterparties. Whatever view may be taken of these developments generally, neither is desirable in the contect of careful risk apportionment. To date, the courts have to some extent embraced the first, while fortunately restricting the second...|$|R
40|$|No single {{primary source}} exists to provide current and would-be {{participants}} in recreational charter boat {{operations in the}} United States with a basic legal understanding of their rights and obligations. The relevant federal maritime standards, laws, regulations, and judicial interpretations are scattered in isolated codebooks, reporters, and bulletins. Moreover, the governing body of law for boat chartering is admiralty law, which has been shaped throughout the centuries primarily by the traditions and dictates of the commercial shipping and shipbuilding industries. As a result, the logic behind the admiralty framework tends to be obscure when viewed {{in the context of}} a recreational charter boat operation. Nonetheless, a basic tenet of the American legal system is that the individual undertakes to ascertain and abide by the legal authorities applicable to his situation. This research compiles and synthesizes the significant legal requirements of the federal maritime law as they apply to boat chartering. Legal and historical background is provided where it is deemed essential to an understanding of the law. Examination of the legal relationships among the charter boat <b>owner,</b> the <b>charterer,</b> and the crew member reveals their duties, rights, and remedies in various types of charter arrangements. Preparation of this comprehensive overview of the federal maritime law in the context of recreational boat charters has exposed certain inconsistencies which lead to misconceptions about proper compliance. Analysis reveals certain areas of the law which are inappropriate and indeed burdensome for charter operations. Chief among these problems are the confusion surrounding and the stringency of the requirements for a bareboat charter.

Further, it identifies different constraints that the industry meet in their attempt to combat Somali pirates. Some 95 percent of the world’s goods are carried by sea and one of the most important shipping lines connecting Europe and the Far East passes through these pirateinfested waters. It is important to achieve an understanding related to how the pirates are affecting shipowners and charterers and their operations. In order to answer the aims and objectives in this study, a range of shipowners, charterers and brokers were approached through in-depth interviews and questionnaires. This study revealed that the dry cargo shipping industry has adopted safety measures from the BMP 3. However, these guidelines are considered as a minimum of what needs to be done and guards are therefore engaged as additional security. Further, it was found that insurance premiums have increased, crew are being paid bonuses for their service in the High Risk Area and trade routes have changed. All this results in additional costs for the shipowner and the charterer. Lastly, if was found that political issues are the most significant constrains in the <b>owner’s</b> and <b>charterer’s</b> quest {{to reduce the risk of}} pirate attacks. This was mostly related to a lack of common viewpoint in the industry as to how pirates should be combated and where the responsibility lay. It is clear from this study that the operational costs have increased, and operations have changed in the industry’s attempt to reduce the risk of pirate attacks. From the study one can conclude that the lack of united actions in the industry are preventing a successful attempt to combat Somali pirates.

40|$|Stowaways {{are people}} who are placing {{themselves}} and others at great risk when they unlawfully embark vessels. They are mostly found on container vessels and the greatest problems exist in West Africa where the majority of these embarkations occur. Stowaways generate increasing expenses for the parties involved in terms of repatriation costs and temporary living expenses. In addition to these actual costs, the stowaway causes loss of time and constitutes a mental strain on the crew of the afflicted vessel. This thesis has examined the laws and regulations governing the handling of stowaways in the maritime sector and what agreements and other available possibilities exist in order to limit liability. This is done in order to help those who come in contact with stowaways to handle situations which can arise. The method of this thesis has mainly consisted of literature studies of laws, rules and guidelines. The thesis also includes three case studies. These are real cases that are intended to give the reader a sense of realism, highlighting the difficulties and showing in what ways the laws are applied in reality. There are a number of international organizations that have developed conventions and regulations concerning stowaways, such as IMO, UNHCR, FAL Convention and the ISPS Code. Furthermore, {{there are a number of}} laws applicable to stowaways in the Swedish legislation. These rules results in a clear framework of how vessel security should be structured in order to prevent stowaways from embarking and how they should be treated when an incident has occurred. To allocate responsibility between ship <b>owners</b> and <b>charterers</b> regarding stowaways, BIMCO has designed a standard clause that can be used in charter agreements at sea.

30|$|The term ‘tramp {{shipping}} optimisation’ {{refers to}} the use of OR to maximise the revenue or minimise the cost of a tramp shipping problem, subject to the limited shipping resources. One such tramp shipping problem exists when there are some ships and some cargoes and it is required to find out the cargo mix assigned to each ship voyage which maximises total gross profit per day for all ships, subject to ship capacity and cargo time window (lay can). Name this problem area ‘optimisation of ship voyage’. To give more details on this area, consider the following facts. Unlike ‘optimisation in liner shipping’, both ports of call and port calling sequence are here assumed optional. Charter party, signed by the ship <b>owner</b> and the <b>charterer,</b> usually specifies terms and clauses to be followed by both parties. Non-demise voyage charter parties are assumed here. Terms generally include the following items: calling ports, calling sequence, cargo freight, cargo time window (lay can), allowable cargo handling time (lay days), dispatch count if actual days are less than lay days, and demurrage count if more. Loading and discharging lay days may be considered in reversible or irreversible manner. If reversible, lay days are specified for loading and discharging collectively. If irreversible, lay days are specified for loading and discharging separately. The gross terms of voyage charter party are here assumed unless otherwise specified. Before cargoes are being fixed by the ship owner, ‘optimisation of ship voyage’ helps in proposing a voyage plan suggesting an optimal cargo mix for each ship. This mix maximises the sum of voyage gross profit per day for all ships, subject to ship capacity, cargo lay can, and other voyage charter party terms. In the cargo mix selection, the random nature of sea transport demand has to be considered.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that bulk {{shipping}} is a highly competitive market and is subject to volatile freight rates caused by an imbalance between demand and supply as well as changes in input costs. As such companies constantly face challenges of being competitive in the market and making profit. Companies need not only to keep operational costs low but also maintain a high level of customers' satisfaction and service quality. On the other hand, the scope and terms of shipping service are subject to negotiation and agreement between the shipper and the carrier; the delivery of shipping services are governed by a mutually agreed charter party that documents the terms and conditions of the contract of carriage. Charter parties have historically favoured <b>owners</b> and left <b>charterers</b> dissatisfied with the services provided, even though the services provided are as per the contract. This is mainly because the expectation of service is not well communicated; carriers monitor the expectation of service quality based on their past experience and market research, while the service quality expectations of shippers are beyond the terms and conditions of the charter party that often cannot specify the intangible elements of service quality. This study is the first and critical step in determining the overall gap between the perceptions and expectations of service quality in dry bulk shipping in Asia. Although the concept of service quality is not new in dry bulk shipping, it is often not well understood. The current study extends previous research on service quality to dry bulk shipping in Asia and investigates the contribution of the key factors to service quality as a means for carriers to differentiate their service and improve company competitiveness in the market. To achieve the above research objective, the quantitative primary data for the study are collected through an online survey and are then used to measure the gap between the service quality expectations of shippers and carriers. A survey questionnaire is developed based on Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry's (1988, 1992, 1995) approach adapted to dry bulk shipping. The results of descriptive and inferential statistical analysis suggest that a significant gap exists between the service quality expectations of shippers and carriers. It has also been found that shippers are willing to pay a premium for better service quality. This implies that carriers need to align their service quality with the expectations of shippers if they want to improve customer satisfaction and gain competitive advantage. Alternatively, improved service quality that is aligned with shippers' expectations would result in higher productivity, less delay, increased market share and profits. The study highlights that dry bulk shippers consider intangible elements of service to be more important than tangible elements. Shippers expect their carriers {{to do more than just}} fulfilling the terms and conditions of the contract of carriage. While, 82...|$|R
