This incorporated {{a thin layer}} of material that prevented ink from penetrating and was relatively soft and easy to remove from the page. An ordinary soft pencil eraser could quickly produce perfect erasures <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> paper. However, the same characteristics that made the paper erasable made the characters subject to smudging due to ordinary friction and deliberate alteration after the fact, making it unacceptable for business correspondence, contracts, or any archival use.|$|E

500|$|The {{new feature}} {{continued}} {{to be known as}} The Concert Feature or Musical Feature as late as November 1938. Hal Horne, a publicist for Disney's film distributor RKO Radio Pictures, wished for a different title, and gave the suggestion Filmharmonic Concert. Stuart Buchanan then held a contest at the studio for a title that produced almost 1,800 suggestions including Bach to Stravinsky and Bach and Highbrowski by Stokowski. Still, the favorite among the film's supervisors was Fantasia, an early working title that had even grown on Horne, [...] "It isn't the word alone but the meaning we read into it." [...] From the beginning of its development, Disney expressed the greater importance of music in Fantasia compared to his past work: [...] "In our ordinary stuff, our music is always under action, but on this... we're supposed to be picturing this musicâ€”not the music fitting our story." [...] Disney had hoped that the film would bring classical music to people who, like himself, had previously [...] "walked out <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> stuff".|$|E
500|$|The ship's {{constant}} movement also impacted character animation. Once the ship's movement reached a certain angle, Hansen {{and any other}} characters on deck start to slide, and have to compensate in whatever direction was necessary relative to their position. According to Levastre, this meant Hansen required nine times the animations usually seen in third-person games (center, front, back, left, right and four intermediary positions). Ultimately, Hansen had {{two hundred and fifty}} separate animations, and most of the non-player characters had one hundred and fifty. According to Antonin Delboy, lead animator on the game, [...] "all the technical decisions were taken in favor of animation, both in terms of quality and quantity, which is very rare <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> project." [...] Basic animation was produced with 3D Studio Max software. Inverse kinematics were then used to create the nine directional animations, with the engine calculating the level of character compensation depending on the angle of the ship. Each character movement is composed of basic animation and compensation animation, and Delboy says that in total, the game contains more than nine hundred animations, allowing for over five thousand possible movements. Levastre stated [...] "The interaction between the storm and the characters that are on the deck sometimes creates some really breathtaking moments. And on top of that, we managed to offer some really intense action sequences featuring far more enemies than in most horror games." ...|$|E
2500|$|Philosopher Peter Singer of Princeton University {{has argued}} that ALF direct action can only be {{regarded}} as a just cause if it is non-violent, and that the ALF is at its most effective when uncovering evidence of animal abuse that other tactics could not expose. He cites 1984's [...] "Unnecessary Fuss" [...] campaign, when ALF raided the University of Pennsylvania's head-injury research clinic and removed footage showing researchers laughing at the brain damage of conscious baboons, as an example. The university responded that the treatment of the animals conformed to National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines, but {{as a result of the}} publicity, the lab was closed down, the chief veterinarian fired, and the university placed on probation. Barbara Orlans, a former animal researcher with the NIH, now with the Kennedy Institute of Ethics, writes that the case stunned the biomedical community, and is today considered one of the most significant cases in the ethics of using animals in research. Singer argues that if the ALF would focus <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> direct action, instead of sabotage, it would appeal to the minds of reasonable people. Against this, Steven Best writes that industries and governments have too much institutional and financial bias for reason to prevail.|$|E

We may well suppose, that, at some remote period, a bird which was perhaps the common and more generalised ancestor of most of our thrushes, warblers, wrens, etc., had spread widely over the great northern continent, and had given rise to numerous varieties adapted to special conditions of life. Among these some took to feeding on the borders of clear streams, picking out such larvae and molluscs as they could reach in shallow water. When food became scarce they would attempt to pick them out of deeper and deeper water, and while doing this in cold weather many would become frozen and starved. But any which possessed denser and more hairy plumage than usual, which was able to keep out the water, would survive; and thus a race would be formed which would depend more and more <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> food. Then, following up the frozen streams into the mountains, {{they would be able to}} live there during the winter; and as such places afforded them much protection from enemies and ample shelter for their nests and young, further adaptations would occur, till the wonderful power of diving and flying under water was acquired by a true land-bird.|$|E
