On carbonisation, low micropore volumes and mean pore widths of about 0. 25 cm 3 g- 1 and < 1 nm, respectively, are obtained.

This thesis research focused on the syntheses of oligopeptide-functionalized polyesters and polyolefins. Polyester functionalization was geared towards applications in biomaterials, tissue engineering, and drug delivery by incorporating sequences that promote cell-adhesion. These polyester- graft -oligopeptide materials were prepared by a 1, 3 -Huisgen cycloaddition reaction, 2 ̆ 2 click 2 ̆ 2 chemistry, of an azide-terminated oligopeptide (prepared by Fmoc-based solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)) and alkyne-containing polyester (synthesized by ring-opening polymerization). Following the syntheses of these materials, they were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and <b>organic</b> <b>gel</b> permeation chromatography (GPC). The oligopeptide-functionalized polyolefins were designed for nucleic acid complexation, and therefore the oligopeptide sequences were intended to incorporate positively-charged moieties (e. g., oligolysine) for DNA and short interfering RNA (siRNA) complexation. These graft copolymers, prepared by SPPS followed by ring-opening metathesis polymerization, have highly tunable structures that enable control over charge density and polymer backbone rigidity.

Xerogel properties have been tailored, within this study, by altering the synthesis procedure {{with a focus on}} monomer concentrations, catalyst to monomer ratio, and the introduction of a nitrogen-rich precursor, thereby incorporating nitrogen into the structure to additionally affect the chemical properties of the final gel. Melamine (M) is used as the source of nitrogen, partially replacing the resorcinol (R) typically used, and resulting in a melamine-resorcinol-formaldehyde (MRF) gel; synthesis was facilitated by a sodium carbonate catalyst (C), as often used in RF gel production. R/C and R/F molar ratios, and M concentration ([M]), were chosen as parameters to study in-depth, as they have previously been shown to markedly influence sol-gel formation. The MRF gels produced were subsequently characterized to determine porous structure and chemical functionality. The results indicate that, texturally, increasing [M] produces a similar effect as increasing R/C values: increasing pore size, while decreasing surface area. Pore volume tends to increase when R/C or M increase individually but pore volume and surface area decrease drastically when both variables increase concurrently. Microporosity also tends to increase as R/C decreases, and as the concentration of M is decreased. Altering the gel matrix, by replacing M for R, results in a weakening of the gel structure, as the bridges formed during curing are reduced in quantity, which indicates a maximum level of substitution that can occur within these materials. Combined, these results suggest that nitrogen can be successfully incorporated into <b>organic</b> <b>gel</b> structures but that the interplay between process variables is crucial in determining final gel characteristics for specific applications...|$|E
30|$|Nowadays, {{researchers}} {{related to}} bioinspired and biomimetic biomineralization for {{the preparation of}} user friendly and cost effective functional biomaterial are giving much emphasis. Material scientists are focusing much {{on the use of}} polymeric-based matrices as a promising tool for the development, repair and regenerate the functional tissues, organs, etc. of the body (Rauch et al. 2012). In material science, mimicking the natural structure design offers the great advantage in developing hybrid materials that combine the properties of organic polymers and inorganic phase. The combination of organic–inorganic phase leads to strengthening the properties of the prepared material (Rauch et al. 2012). Numerous studies have been proposed till now on bioinspired matrix-based biomineralization. Mineralization carried out on the matrix, which are fibrous and porous in nature, can provide better framed structure on which growth and nucleation process of inorganic crystals can occur (Kim and Park 2014). However, to accomplish this process, several biominerals play an important role as they possess specific shape and properties. Further, most of the studies carried out till now are focused on the development of crystal formation on gels, fibers, or film (Kim and Park 2014). Also, it is interesting to understand the role of chemical motifs that are mediated by the matrix properties in the form of its pore size, its composition, functionalization with active groups present within the polymeric matrix and cross-linking density (Nindiyasari et al. 2015). Biominerals in the form of hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate/carbonate are used to carry out the process of biomineralization, thus forming organic–inorganic hybrid materials (Rauch et al. 2012; Feng-ju et al. 2012). Among all the biominerals, calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 as calcite) {{is one of the most}} abundant minerals found in the nature produced by organisms. It has also several industrial applications like fillers in paints, plastics, or paper (Feng-ju et al. 2012). From the literature survey, it was found that mostly calcite crystal shows the crystallographic orientation within the hard tissues (Nindiyasari et al. 2015). Further, the formation of crystals within the matrix could be explained by the classical theory of crystallization which can be elaborately explained by the mesocystal theory (Rauch et al. 2012).

40|$|The {{process of}} forward osmosis (FO) has been {{reported}} to be a promising potential alternative to current pressure driven membrane processes such as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis. However, the lack of full understanding on essential aspects of the process such as membrane fouling and the inherent phenomena of concentration polarization is still a major drawback impeding its progress towards real world applications. The coupled effects of membrane fouling and concentration polarization have catastrophic impact on permeate flux. Therefore, this research work was aimed at investigating the key mechanisms that lead to membrane fouling in a forward osmosis process used for brackish/seawater desalination as well as wastewater reclamation. Model organic compounds representative of various common organic foulants (polysaccharides, proteins, humic substances and fatty acids) were used to prepare different synthetic feed streams representative of seawater and wastewater. These feed water types were then used to test the fouling behaviour of forward osmosis membranes such as the much studied traditional cellulose triacetate memmbrane as well as thin film composite membranes. Severe flux loss was observed in feed streams containing alginate, bovine serum albumin and humic acid; this was attributed to the presence negatively charged functional groups (i. e. -COOH) on organic foulants that resulted in specific reaction with cations particularly calcium ions leading to complexed moieties that were easily deposited onto the membrane surface under significant permeation drag. Protein molecules were found to severely foul the polyamide thin film composite membrane through multiple layer adsorptions. Membrane structural surface properties (porous structure of support layer), had a dominant role in foulant deposition and in <b>organic</b> <b>gel</b> layer accumulation. Foulants got deposited on the “valley” of the rough surface of the support layer hindering permeation and back-diffusion of solutes resulting in severe internal concentration polarization. The key foulant-foulant interactions that influence membrane fouling behaviour during combined fouling were investigated by conducting series of systematic experiments using various combinations of organic and colloidal foulants. Foulant-foulant interactions were identified through sequential fouling experiments; where the membrane was fouled with the two foulants in alternating sequences. The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM-D) with dissipation monitor was also used to investigate surface interactions between colloidal particles and organic foulants. It was revealed that when two foulants co-exist in a FO process, fouling is usually dominated a single foulant. This was evident when alginate co-existed with silica colloids in the same feed solution; cake layer formation was dominated by alginate aggregates. The alginate had a primary effect on the cake layer formation. The new approach of sequential fouling experiments and QCM-D analysis provided proof of the adsorption of alginate onto the surface of silica particles surfaces which led to altered colloid-colloid interactions such that the resulting cake layer had the same hydraulic characteristics as that of the alginate fouling layer. A similar observation was observed when both alginate and bovine serum albumin were present in the same feed solution. However, eventually more severe permeate flux loss was observed compared to that caused by either foulant suggesting that Bovine serum albumin molecules initiated foulant deposition, thereafter synergistic effects between the two foulants through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions lead to severe flux loss. Characterization analyses using advanced contact angle measurements were used to gain insight onto foulant-membrane interactions at contact as well foulant feed water stability. Given the virtual absence of electrostatic interactions at seawater level ionic strength (the increase in feed ionic strength was shown to reduce the Debyle length and electric double layer {{to such an extent that}} normal electrostatic interactions effectively suppressed), interaction of the membrane and foulant at contact was found to be better explained by the short-range acid-base interactions from the two interacting surfaces. The surface free energies correlated strongly with the rates of membrane fouling and predicted membrane fouling by alginate. However, due to the nature of the resulting fouling layer from combined fouling (dominance of one foulant) the prediction of the fouling behavior due to multi-component feed solutions was not as accurate as those for single foulants. A strategy to clean fouled forward osmosis membranes was developed by gaining insight into the key physical cleaning mechanisms involved in a simple osmotic backwash process during the cleaning of FO membranes fouled under seawater conditions. The osmotic backwash process was found to effectively restore membrane flux (> 80 %) of cellulose triacetate membrane fouled with alginate during seawater desalination. The fouling layer (alginate gel) removal was shown to be a function of both permeate flux rate induced by the cleaning draw solution and the shear force generated by increased cross-flow velocities of bulk solution. It was also revealed that the high permeate rate responsible for faster membrane fouling (increased foulant deposition rate) was a requirement for the effective fouling layer removal during osmotic backwash. Therefore, this implies that the ideal operational conditions for a long FO run include moderate permeate fluxes with high feed cross-flow velocity...|$|E

The detailed examination of a 1 b + CoCl 2 gel system in ethanol showed that the gel is stabilised by the cross-link of 1 b molecules by the Co(II) –amino group interaction. This is the first and a convenient method for the metal reinforcement of <b>organic</b> <b>gels...</b>|$|R

In {{order to}} improve mass {{transport}} in the pore texture of carbon supported catalysts, the widely used supports (activated carbons or carbon blacks) can be replaced by carbon gels, i. e. texture-tailored materials obtained by drying and pyrolysis of <b>organic</b> <b>gels.</b> Carbon xerogels issued from resorcinol-formaldehyde aqueous gels were used as metal catalyst supports both in gas phase heterogeneous catalysis and in PEM fuel cell electrodes. These materials, composed of very pure carbon, allow for excellent metal dispersion via impregnation methods. Pd-Ag/C catalysts were obtained by impregnation and tested for hydrodechlorination reactions in gaseous phase. Pt loaded carbon xerogels were tested as electrocatalysts in PEM fuel cell cathodes. In both cases, the well-adapted structure of the support {{proved to be a}} great advantage compared to classical activated carbons or carbon blacks: (i) in the gas phase reaction, diffusional limitations encountered with activated carbon supports were completely eliminated; (ii) in fuel cells, Pt loaded catalysts enabled decreasing the effect of diffusion in the catalytic layer on potential loss and led to increasing the global metal utilization ratio. hal- 00490247, version 1 - 16 Jun 2010 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Organic</b> <b>gels</b> {{have been}} {{synthesized}} by sol-gel polycondensation of phenol (P) and formaldehyde (F) catalyzed by sodium carbonate (C). The effect of synthesis parameters such as phenol/catalyst ratio (P/C), solvent exchange liquid and drying method, on the porous {{structure of the}} gels have been investigated. The total and mesopore volumes of the PF gels increased with increasing P/C ratio {{in the range of}} P/C a parts per thousand currency sign 8, after this both properties started to decrease with P/C ratio for P/C > 8 and the gel with P/C = 8 showed the highest total and mesopore volumes of 1. 281 and 1. 279 cm(3) g(- 1) respectively. The gels prepared by freeze drying possessed significantly higher porosities than the vacuum dried gels. The pore volume and average pore diameter of the freeze dried gels were significantly higher than those of the vacuum dried gels. T-butanol emerged as the preferred solvent for the removal of water from the PF hydrogel prior to drying, as significantly higher pore volumes and specific surface areas were obtained in the corresponding dried gels. The results showed that freeze drying with t-butanol and lower P/C ratios were favourable conditions for the synthesis of highly mesoporous phenol-formaldehyde gels...|$|R
40|$|Resorcinol and {{formaldehyde}} {{react in}} aqueous solutions to form nanoporous <b>organic</b> <b>gels</b> {{well suited for}} a wide range of applications from supercapacitors and batteries to adsorbents and catalyst supports. In this work, we investigated the mechanism and kinetics of formation of primary clusters in the early stages of formation of resorcinol–formaldehyde gels in the presence of dissolved sodium carbonate. Dynamic Light Scattering measurements showed that size of freely diffusing primary clusters was independent of both reactant and carbonate concentrations at a given temperature, reaching the mean hydrodynamic radius of several nanometres before further changes were observed. However, more primary clusters formed at higher carbonate concentrations, and cluster numbers were steadily increasing over time. Our results indicate that the size of primary clusters appears to be thermodynamically controlled, where a solubility/miscibility limit is reached due to formation of certain reaction intermediates resulting in approximately monodisperse primary clusters, most likely liquid like, similar to formation of micelles or spontaneous nanoemulsions. Primary clusters eventually form a particulate network through subsequent aggregation and/or coalescence and further polymerisation, leading to nanoscale morphologies of resulting wet gels. Analogous formation mechanisms have been previously proposed for several polymerisation and sol–gel systems, including monodisperse silica, organosilicates and zeolites...|$|R
