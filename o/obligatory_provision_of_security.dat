40|$|The field <b>of</b> <b>security</b> policy {{seems to}} have {{undergone}} {{dramatic changes in the}} last decades. Under the broad umbrella of a turn to security governance, one can observe trends of an internationalization and privatization <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> <b>Of</b> these trends, one seems to stand out, that is the increasing reliance of states on private business actors in the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> How do theses trends affect the state? While some believe that the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> by private agents is unproblematic as long as the state keeps its governmental supervision, others fear that the state is losing its capability to control the activities of private actors in the field <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> the more privatization proceeds. The working paper, firstly, provides a systematic overview on the inclusion of private business actors in the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> Secondly, it will address the question of its consequences for the state.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{substantiate}} the methodical approach to determining the level <b>of</b> formation and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> enterprise personnel <b>security.</b> By analyzing, systematizing and generalizing scientific achievements of many scientists, approaches to the evaluation <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> at the enterprise were considered, a set of indices for evaluation <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> was defined. There justified the urgency of creating a comprehensive approach to evaluation <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> that includes implementation of the following stages: defining a list of indices corresponding to the level <b>of</b> formation and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> {{with the help of}} the expert evaluation method; calculating integral indices <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> for each component and the corresponding level by means of the taxonomic analysis; grouping enterprises by the level <b>of</b> formation and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> with the use of the cluster and discriminant analysis. It is found that the implementation of this approach will allow not only determining the level <b>of</b> formation and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> at the enterprise, but also developing appropriate recommendations on improving its state. Prospects for further research in this direction are evaluation of conditions for formation and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> personnel <b>security</b> at the enterprise, which will enable revealing negative destabilizing factors that influence personnel securit...|$|R

40|$|Proprietary rule, {{whereby the}} state is owned by a ruler who maximizes tax {{revenues}} minus the costs of governing, is a useful ideal type that describes many of the states that have ever existed. The study of proprietary rule and its public finance, however, is comparatively scarce. I argue that proprietary rule emerges out of anarchy and its main alternative - self-governance - has diÂ¢ culties surviving because of problems in providing effective internal and external security. Competitive proprietary rule (or, anarchy) is the market structure for the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> that is more stable, but is highly inefficient because all the savings that come out <b>of</b> the public <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> are dissipated into contests for power among proprietary rulers. I also explore how competitive proprietary rule can be consolidated into more complex forms of governance. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the hopes}} {{of the people in}} South Africa that the new {{democracy}} would bring significant changes to the many impoverished people in the country, this has not happened. In relation to security, crime has risen {{to the top of the}} national agenda and is the focus of public and media attention. The government's lacking capacity to deal with the massive problems of crime has led to a gap in the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> The economically empowered have been able to fill part of this gap by purchasing the services <b>of</b> private <b>security</b> companies, but to the vast majority of South Africans this is not an option. The focus of this study is to locate the different communities' ability to generate local capacity to confront this gap in security provision. A comparative study of three distinct communities in Hout Bay is in this respect suitable because they each contain a different segment of the South African population, and represent very different socioeconomic standards. The relatively affluent white community in the Valley has managed to gather around a collective project to reduce property crime through a newly formed Neighbourhood Watch, and network extensively with the police and private security companies to achieve their goals. In contrast to this, the neighbouring communities have not been successful at developing projects that could enhance their security. Instead, the mainly African township Imizamo Yethu is characterised by internal division and conflict, while the coloured community in Hangberg has sunk into a collective apathy. To explain the communities' varying ability to affect their <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> a focus on social relations, identity formation, and networking is applied, as well as a nodal governance approach to map the existing nodes that seek to impact the governance <b>of</b> <b>security</b> in each community. Though the white community is more able than the others to affect the local <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> the contemporary development is increasing the already substantial differences between the communities, and it is likely that this will lead to more distrust and tension. This study seems to indicate that unless the people of Hout Bay are able to build common projects that will enhance the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> to all communities, they may all stand to lose in the long run...|$|R

40|$|With {{regards to}} social constructivism, this project explores {{the effects of}} private {{military}} and security companies on states’ authority and their <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> A core aspect of legitimate state authority is the monopoly of violence, which the military is understood as being the practical extension of. The effect on states monopolization of violence, and consequently state authority, when the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> has been outsourced to private military and security companies becomes relevant while working with the <b>security</b> dimension <b>of</b> the social contract. Based on empirical data from the United States, Japan and Sierra Leone, we argue for some observable generalisations regarding the effects on the social contract in relation to security, and consequently states’ authority, when outsourcing the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> to private military and security companies. We have found that, as such, states’ reliance on private military and security companies does not significantly affect states’ authority, and subsequently the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> in neither the United States nor Japan. However, there are some implications within Sierra Leone, in which the social contract in relation to security was affected by the Sierra Leonean state’s use of private military and security companies. Generally, {{it was observed that}} by outsourcing military functions to private military and security companies, a new actor entered into the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> civil society’s <b>security.</b> While the state’s monopoly of violence is partially being eroded, it does not necessarily entail that the authority of states are affected. Rather, a monopsy of violence is established. On the basis of historic and cultural trends within each case study, we argue that the social contract in relation to security needs to be analysed in a country-specific context. By arguing that the social contract in relation to security is country-specific, it is also argued that the use of private military and security companies does not warrant the same effects on states’ authority among all states, but rather that this requires further investigation on a country-by-country basis. Lastly, this project also discusses the implications on states’ authority while part of an international society in which states interact with international organisations, non-governmental organisations and private firms. When utilising a social constructivist framework, it is argued that states are becoming increasingly international and, as such, should be investigated in a national as well as in an international context...|$|R
