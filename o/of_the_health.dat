5|$|Although {{his suicide}} is often {{linked to the}} Foundation’s {{financial}} difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro overwhelmed by the corruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> system and feeling {{that he could not}} fight against this powerful organization. In some parts of the letter, he refers to himself as “Don Quijote” in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue is}} using {{standardized}} technology for communication with agencies in other countries. Norway {{is a member}} of the Schengen Agreement, which requires trans-border communication between law enforcement agencies. There were 27 different networks for the police, one for each police district. In Oslo, Akershus and Østfold, the police had also been using Enhanced Digital Access Communication System since 1994. There were 230 municipal fire department radio systems, and a manual mobile phone system for the health sector. The health network was built by the county municipalities between 1990 and 1995 and covers all parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> service, including paramedics, ambulance services, midwives and medical doctors. The various systems had different levels of coverage. In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT450) telephones were being used where encrypted communication was necessary.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} novels in the series, aspects of Thunderball come from Fleming's own experiences: the visit to the health clinic was inspired by his own 1955 trip to the Enton Hall health farm and Bond's medical record, as read out to him by M, is a slightly modified version of Fleming's own. The name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> farm, Shrublands, was taken {{from that of a}} house owned by the parents of his wife's friend, Peter Quennell. Fleming dedicates a quarter of the novel to the Shrublands setting and the naturalist cure Bond undergoes.|$|E

That was the date when Blandy realized, for the first time, that Geiger counters could not detect plutonium. Blandy was aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> problems of radium dial painters who ingested microscopic amounts of radium in the 1920s, {{and the fact that}} plutonium was assumed to have a similar biological effect.

5|$|In 1909, Bryce {{reported}} that, between 1894 and 1908, {{mortality rates}} at some residential schools in western Canada ranged from 30% to 60% {{over five years}} (that is, five years after entry, 30% to 60% of students had died, or 6–12% per annum). These statistics did not become public until 1922, when Bryce, who was no longer working for the government, published The Story of a National Crime: Being a Record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921. In particular, he alleged that the high mortality rates {{could have been avoided}} if healthy children had not been exposed to children with tuberculosis. At the time, no antibiotic had been identified to treat the disease, and this exacerbated the impact of the illness. Streptomycin, the first effective treatment, was not introduced until 1943.|$|E
5|$|In western societies, {{voluntary}} {{blood donation}} is a common, yet less extreme, form of risk taking. Costs {{associated with these}} donations include pain and risk of infection.

5|$|Nonfatal {{health effects}} were {{difficult}} to measure in the smog's immediate aftermath. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> effects were themselves delayed; for example, most of the serious effects on the elderly population would only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health research group, found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative health effects from the smog, including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the research group said anything serious enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog had, indicated {{the existence of a}} serious public health problem.|$|E

Few areas of the US health care system were left untouched, making it the most sweeping health care reform since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. However, some areas were more affected than others. The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, {{and many of the}} law's regulations applied specifically to this market, while the structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market were largely retained. Most of the coverage gains were made through the expansion of Medicaid, and the biggest cost savings were made in Medicare. Some regulations applied to the employer market, and the law also made delivery system changes that affected most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> care system. Not all provisions took full effect. Some were made discretionary, some were deferred, and others were repealed before implementation.|$|E
