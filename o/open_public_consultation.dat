40|$|Background The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{the development of}} evidence-based practice guidelines for the nutritional management of adult patients with head and neck cancer using a wiki platform to enable wide international stakeholder consultation and maintain currency. Methods A dietitian steering committee and a multidisciplinary steering committee were established for consultation. Traditional methods of evidence-based guideline development were utilised to perform the literature review, assess the evidence and produce a draft document. This was transferred to a wiki platform for stakeholder consultation and international endorsement processes in Australia, New Zealand and the UK. Data were collected on website traffic utilising Google Analytics. Results In addition to broad stakeholder consultation through the steering committees, an additional twenty comments were received via the wiki by twelve individuals covering six different professions from three different countries, compared to four comments by e-mail. The guidelines were subsequently endorsed by the dietetic associations of Australia, New Zealand and the UK. During a 4 -month period monitoring {{the use of the}} guidelines, there were 2303 page views to the landing page from 33 countries. The average number of pages accessed per visit was five and the duration of time spent on the website was approximately 6 min. Conclusions Using a wiki platform for guideline development and dissemination is a successful method for producing high-quality resources that can undergo wide international stakeholder review and include <b>open</b> <b>public</b> <b>consultation.</b> This can replace conventional methods whereby guidelines can quickly become outdated...|$|E
40|$|The Nordic {{countries}} have collaborated in setting guidelines for dietary composition and recommended intakes of nutrients {{for several decades}} through the joint publication of the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR).   This 5 th edition, the NNR 2012, gives Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for nutrients, and compared with earlier editions more emphasis {{has been put on}} evaluating the scientific evidence for the role of food and food patterns contributing to the prevention of the major diet-related chronic diseases. Recommendations on physical activity are included and interaction with physical activity has been taken into account for the individual nutrient recommendations wherever appropriate. A chapter on sustainable food consumption has been added.   A Nordic perspective has been accounted for in setting the reference values. The NNR 2012 has used an evidence-based and transparent approach in assessing associations between nutrients and foods and certain health outcomes.   Systematic reviews form the basis for the recommendations of several nutrients and topics, while a less stringent update has been done for others.   The systematic reviews and individual chapters have been peer reviewed and the systematic reviews are published in the Food & Nutrition Research journal. The draft chapters were subject to an <b>open</b> <b>public</b> <b>consultation.</b>   Recommendations have been changed only when sufficient scientific evidence has evolved since the 4 th edition. The primary aim of the NNR 2012 is to present the scientific background of the recommendations and their application.   A secondary aim is for the NNR 2012 to function as a basis for the national recommendations that are adopted by the individual Nordic countries...|$|E

30|$|Policy {{changes and}} {{initiatives}} are often {{triggered by the}} stakeholders {{that are going to}} be affected by those future policies, e.g. a specific sector of the industry. In democratic countries policy makers typically consult a limited number of experts and the largest stakeholders directly involved before issuing a new policy proposal. However, this process leaves citizens and smaller stakeholders underrepresented in the process of policy-shaping. Therefore in many countries, governments are working on improving the communication with citizens and stakeholders to increase their involvement in the law-making process. As an example, the European Commission (EC) has been making a significant effort to engage an increasing number of citizens in the EU law-making process by means of <b>open</b> <b>public</b> <b>consultations</b> (European Political Strategy Centre 2018). This was formerly known as the “Your Voice in Europe” initiative where citizens and stakeholders were encouraged to provide feedback to policy proposals by means of responses to the <b>open</b> <b>public</b> <b>consultations.</b> Typically, the responses are limited to a few hundred, mostly coming from the lobbying organizations that are active in the specific policy areas.|$|R

40|$|Esta pesquisa trata do impacto causado pela aproximação entre produtores e receptores na produção {{cultural}} no ciberespaço, que afetou diretamente o status do autor e o modo como ele se constrói na sociedade. A digitalização dos produtos culturais e o compartilhamento em rede desestabilizaram três categorias fundamentais que sustentam os direitos autorais: o autor, a propriedade e o trabalho. O objetivo desta pesquisa é apresentar algumas mudanças epistemológicas em relação a noção de propriedade intelectual enquanto fonte de remuneração autoral. Tais mudanças afetam de maneira significativa os modos como as obras se comunicam com o público. Isso porque, dentre outros fatores relacionados, o controle sobre a reprodução das obras imateriais torna-se cada vez mais complexo e ineficiente. O problema desta pesquisa reside no fato de que tanto a função-autor como o papel do usuário foram radicalmente alterados, impactando o modo como circulam os discursos e a produção cultural. O tema será estudado sob dois ângulos de análise: do ponto de vista do sistema jurídico e das estruturas de poder relacionadas a indústria cultural; e da cultura. Apresentamos debates sobre propriedade intelectual (Virno 2003, Hardt & Negri 2005 e Gorz 2005), cultura livre (Lessig 2004, 2009; e Lemos 2005, 2010, 2011); a função-autor (Foucault, 1969) e o conceito de paradigma da imunização desenvolvido por Roberto Esposito (2005, 2010). Os estudos divulgados durante o período da consulta pública aberta pelo Ministério da Cultura em 2007 pelos grupos acadêmicos ligados a FGV, USP e UFSC, constituíram ainda a base para compreendermos, no âmbito jurídico, quais são as alterações propostas para reforma da lei de direitos autorais brasileira, 9. 610 / 98. O resultado da pesquisa foi uma atualização de discussões nem sempre correlacionadas e que, analisadas sistemicamente, apontam para mudanças significativas nos modos de se pensar as novas relações entre autoria, obra e público nas redes cognitivas do ciberespaçoThis {{research is}} about the impact caused by the proximity between producers and receivers {{in the context of}} cyberspace cultural production. This phenomenon has directly affected author status and the way it is constructed in society. The digitalization of cultural products and the network sharing have destabilized three fundamental categories that holds the copyright: the author, the property and the labor. The purpose of this research is to introduce some changes regarding the epistemological notion of intellectual property as a remuneration copyright source. These changes affect significantly {{the ways in which the}} works communicate with public. This is a relevant thing why among other related factors, the control over the intangible works reproduction becomes increasingly more complex and inefficient. The problem of this research resides in the fact that both, the author-function as the user's role, has been radically altered impacting the way the discourses and the cultural production circulates. The theme will be studied from two angles of analysis: from the standpoint of the legal system and power structures related of cultural industry, and from culture. We will introduce debates regarding intellectual property (Virno 2003, Hardt & Negri 2005, Gorz 2005), free culture (Lessig 2004, 2009, 2005; and Lemos, 2005, 2010, 2011); author-function (Foucault, 1969) and the concept of immunization paradigm developed by Roberto Esposito (2005, 2010).

Several projects have been started such as the European Medicines Agency´s (EMA) “proactive publication of clinical trial data”, theBMJ open data campaign, or theAllTrials initiative. The executive director of the EMA, Dr. Guido Rasi, has recently announced that clinical trial data on patient level will be published from 2014 onwards (although it has since been delayed).

Contributors: BRIGLAUER, Wolfgang CAMBINI, Carlo CAVE, Martin PARCU, Pier Luigi ROSSI, Maria Alessandra SHORTALL, Tony SILVESTRI, Virginia VALLETTI, TommasoInternet and its {{connected}} innovative {{technologies are}} fostering the digital economy and society, {{one of the}} main objectives of the European Union and by consequence of the new European Commission. In fact, the deployment of New Generation Networks to ensure specific targets in terms of availability and adoption of fast and high quality Internet connections for European households is {{one of the main}} pillars of the Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE) 2020. In spite of the relatively wide set of policy tools put in place at the European and national level, profound differences in terms of broadband coverage and adoption do however persist across member States. These disparities have largely contributed to a feeling of dissatisfaction for the level of investment in broadband networks in Europe. Partly as a response to this view, the European Commission <b>opened</b> a <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> to assess the need for broadband speed and quality beyond 2020. Following the questions posed by the consultation, this Report intends to focus on targets, i. e. the meta-instrument that precedes the implementation of more traditional policy instruments, such as national plans, sector-specific regulation, competition policy and direct public intervention. In particular, the Report aims at exploring the impact of setting future targets for ultra-fast broadband, also considering the opportunity, and the risks, of formulating targets that specifically favour higher performing technological solutions, i. e. FTTH, which enables connection speeds well above 100 Mbps, over others, i. e. cable, copper, wireless technologies or a mix of them...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The need to {{consider}} the patient perspective in health technology assessments (HTA) has been widely recognized. In July 2012, the Finnish Medicines Agency (Fimea) published a national recommendation for integrating the patient perspective into the HTAs of pharmaceuticals. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe the development of the recommendation for integrating the patient perspective into the HTA process of pharmaceuticals in Finland. Methods: The development of the recommendation was based on a review of international recommendations and experiences of patient and public involvement in HTA. The draft recommendation was tested in two focus group discussions (n = 7 patients) and three individual interviews among diabetes patients (type 1 or 2) using long-acting insulin treatment. The recommendation was <b>open</b> for <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> in April 2012 and revised according to the comments received. Results: Patients will be involved in multiple stages of Fimea’s HTA process. The recommendation includes step-by-step instructions on how to assess the patient perspective. The main focus is on qualitative interviews, which will be conducted at the beginning of the assessments to gain information, particularly on patient preferences and values, including positive and negative outcomes important to patients and ethical and social aspects of the medicine’s use. Conclusions: The recommendation will act as a tool to integrate patients’ experiences, needs and preferences into Fimea’s HTAs of pharmaceuticals...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To develop {{clinical}} practice guidelines for screening, assessing and managing cancer pain in Australian adults. Methods: This three phase project utilised the ADAPTE approach to adapt international cancer pain {{guidelines for the}} Australian setting. A Working Party was established to define scope, screen guidelines for adaptation, and develop recommendations to support better cancer pain control through screening, assessment, pharmacological and non-pharmacological management, and patient education. Recommendations with limited evidence were referred to Expert Panels for advice before the draft guidelines were <b>opened</b> for <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> via the Cancer Council Australia Cancer Guidelines Wiki platform in late 2012. All comments were reviewed by the Working Party and the guidelines revised accordingly. Results: Screening resulted in six international guidelines being included for adaptation - those developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (2008), National Health Service Quality Improvement Scotland (2009), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2012), European Society of Medical Oncology (2011), European Association for Palliative Care (2011, 2012) and National Institute of Clinical Excellence (2012). Guideline adaptation resulted in 55 final recommendations. The guidelines were officially launched in November 2013. Conclusion: International guidelines can be efficiently reconfigured for local contexts using the ADAPTE approach. Availability of the guidelines via the Cancer Council Australia Wiki is intended to promote uptake and enable recommendations to be kept up to date. Resources to support implementation will also be made available via the Wiki if found to be effective by a randomised controlled trial commencing in 2015...|$|R

RECENT events in Soham have drawn {{attention}} {{to some of the}} more negative aspects ofBritish society: the resurgence of national mourning sickness, the actual violence of mobrule, and the instinctive linking in many peoples minds of mental illness with violence. The evidence base on violence and mental illness, however, tells a different story. Less than 10 % of serious violence, including homicide, is attributable to psychosis, 1 with factors such as male sex and youth contributing a much higher proportion to societal violence than mental illness. Indeed, statistically, there is a greater chance of winning the national lottery than being killed by a person with a mental illness. 2 Yet Not In My Back Yard (NIMBY) -ism is rife and mental health service users, particularly those with serious mental illness, continue to live in communities that stereotype them as unemployable and potentially dangerous.

Governments have responded to this expectation by increasing the amount of <b>public</b> <b>consultation.</b> Still, <b>public</b> discontent with the efficacy of <b>public</b> <b>consultations</b> including the level of participation, accessibility, transparency and accountability remains. This thesis focuses on the importance of the quality over the quantity of <b>public</b> <b>consultations</b> to improve satisfaction with government decision making related to land use planning and development. More specifically, it focuses on the following elements: the types and levels of <b>public</b> <b>consultation,</b> accessibility of the consultations for different stakeholders, the influence of stakeholders in decision-making, and the meaning attached by stakeholders to the consultation experience in various planning and development processes. 	This thesis examines the degree of participatory democracy {{within the context of a}} case study of <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> undertaken by the City of Saskatoon between 2000 and 2010 to plan and develop the South Downtown Waterfront Redevelopment. The analysis is rooted in theoretical and conceptual frameworks contained within the relevant literature on <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> drawn from different disciplines. The case study produced several key findings; the most notable is that the stakeholder assessment of the value or efficacy of <b>public</b> <b>consultations</b> used by the City is affected by the mechanisms in which they participate. Public sector and business sector stakeholders invited by the City to participate in central participative mechanisms, such as steering committees, expressed a higher degree of confidence that the consultations had significant positive influence in shaping the project. By contrast, community stakeholders invited by the City to participate in less participative mechanisms, such as open houses, expressed a lower degree of confidence that the <b>public</b> <b>consultations</b> had significant positive influence in shaping the project. This thesis concludes by recommending that the City of Saskatoon enhance participatory democracy in land use planning and development by: expanding the 'Community Engagement Model' to encompass the full 'Public Participation Spectrum' for all stakeholders; establish a complementary evaluation framework based on normative participation principles; expand the types and levels of <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> available; and, adopt more inclusionary, accountable and transparent <b>public</b> <b>consultation</b> practices...|$|R
