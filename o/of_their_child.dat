Early in 1952, Paul was called to the United States Army Reserve for the Korean War. While {{he served in the}} army, she spent a year at Camp Gordon, Georgia. Her life became easier with Paul's army allotment. Coming back from the Korean War in 1954, he took a job with a small newspaper in East Los Angeles, California, and lived in a small apartment in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, with Jayne and her pets— a Great Dane, three cats named Sabina, Romulus, and Ophelia, two chihuahuas, a poodle dyed pink, and a rabbit.

We exploit information on the risk and trust attitudes <b>of</b> parents and <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> as well as rich information about parental efforts in the upbringing <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study. Our results show that parents who invest more in the upbringing <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> are more similar to them with respect to risk and trust attitudes and thus transmit their own attitudes more strongly. The results are robust to including variables {{on the relationship between}} children and parents, family size, and the parents' socioeconomic background...|$|R

25|$|Antichrist is a 2009 English-language Danish {{experimental}} horror film {{written and}} directed by Lars von Trier, and starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg.

The narrative is divided into a prologue, four chapters and an epilogue. The film was primarily a Danish production and co-produced by companies from six different European countries. It was filmed in Germany and Sweden.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the parents}} are over-protective <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> and shield them from {{difficulties}} and injuries. They are {{often referred to as}} “monster parents”.

Indulging by parents may lead children to narcissism.|$|R
25|$|Liability for {{omissions}} {{has long}} existed where a pre-existing duty {{can be established}} between two parties. For example, where an individual accidentally creates a small fire in a flat, he is under a duty to take reasonable steps to extinguish it, or to summon help. A special duty also exists between parents and their children, and an omission of a parent to save their young child from drowning would result in criminal liability, as it is deemed a parent voluntarily undertakes to ensure the wellbeing <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> Other duties may be inferred from contractual obligations, and so an individual employed to ensure individuals do not cross a railway line while there are trains running would be found criminally negligent where he abandoned his post.|$|E
25|$|Healthy narcissism {{might exist}} in all individuals. Freud {{said that this}} is an {{original}} state from which the individual develops the love object. He argued that healthy narcissism {{is an essential part of}} normal development. According to Freud, the love of the parents for their child and their attitude toward their child could be seen as a revival and reproduction of their own narcissism. The child has an omnipotence of thought; the parents stimulate that feeling because in their child they see the things that they have never reached themselves. Compared to neutral observers, parents tend to overvalue the qualities <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> When parents act in an extreme opposite style and the child is rejected or inconsistently reinforced depending on the mood of the parent, the self-needs of the child are not met. Freud contrasts the natural development of active-egoistic and passive-altruistic tendencies in the individual with narcissism, in the former, and what Trevor Pederson refers to as echoism, in the latter.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners {{developed}} {{hand signals}} to communicate {{things they did}} not want the guards or other prisoners to hear. When a prisoner wanted to pass a note down to a girlfriend, he would attach a little bundle {{to the end of a}} long rope woven from mattress fibers and throw the bundle down into the street. The girlfriend down below would run to catch the bundle and take out the note. This would also give her an opportunity to stuff a note, cigarettes, drugs, a photograph <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>child,</b> a weapon, into the bundle, which the inmate could then hoist back up through the hole in the wall, before the guards came running to intercept the line. They called these rope and bundle setups palomas ("pigeons") and apparently, at any given time, seven or eight palomas could be flying down into the street, or back up to the prison, attached to their makeshift ropes.|$|E

25|$|As infants grow, food {{supplements}} are added. Many parents choose commercial, ready-made baby foods to supplement breast milk or formula for the child, while others adapt their usual meals for the dietary needs <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> Whole cow's milk {{can be used}} at one year, but lower-fat milk is not recommended until the child is 2 to 3 years old. Weaning is the process through which breast milk is eliminated from the infant's diet through the introduction of solid foods in exchange for milk. Until they are toilet-trained, infants in industrialized countries wear diapers. The transition from diapers to cloth undergarments is an important transition {{in the development of}} an infant/baby to that of a toddler. Children need more sleep than adults—up to 18 hours for newborn babies, with a declining rate as the child ages. Until babies learn to walk, they are carried in the arms, held in slings or baby carriers, or transported in baby carriages or strollers. Most industrialized countries have laws requiring child safety seats for babies in motor vehicles.|$|E

Ronnie is also pregnant but they agree that Richard will live with Jack and Ronnie when Sam feels unable to cope with parenthood but, having given a child up for adoption, Ronnie can see that Sam is having doubts. Consequently, Ronnie gives her money so she and Richard can leave Walford together. She and Jack marry and prepare for the birth <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> Ronnie bonds with Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) over being abused as children and have given their first child up for adoption. With Jack abroad on business, Ronnie gives birth to a boy called James Branning but he dies of {{sudden infant death syndrome}} within days of being born and as Ronnie seeks help, she swaps her child with Kat's newborn son, Tommy Moon. Ronnie soon regrets her actions but it is too late as James has been found and Jack has returned and met Tommy, thinking he is his son. Ronnie struggles to bond with Tommy and refuses to let anyone see him. She is refused permission to attend James's funeral but goes anyway. At the wake, she gives Tommy to Kat but her intention is misunderstood and leads Jack to think she needs psychiatric help. Ronnie discovers that Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) is Tommy's birth father and tries to sabotage his relationships with Roxy and Jack so he will leave Walford but Michael convinces Jack that Ronnie is obsessed with him. Unable to explain her actions, Ronnie agrees that she needs professional help and visits a counsellor but leaves before the session and lies to Jack about it. Glenda realises that Ronnie is not attending counselling but is forced to leave Walford. Ronnie briefly goes missing, and after Jack brings her home, her behaviour becomes increasingly erratic. After visiting the hospital where James was born, she finally admits the truth and returns Tommy to Kat.|$|E
