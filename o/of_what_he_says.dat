He opined that Occupy felt [...] "nostalgic", largely because the Occupy movement itself [...] "has largely run out of steam." [...] Nevertheless, he thought much of what Chomsky had to say was [...] "practical" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "difficult to refute much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> about the way Western society is set up." ...|$|E

His ideas about the Deros became so fanciful and 'out there' that it became easy for skeptics to dismiss him as a nut. A fraud. There were no aliens. No rape and torture. That's all very fanciful and helped sell pulp magazines. The Deros have much more {{complicated}} goals than that. But Shaver's shouts of 'evil Deros!' distracted any reasonable authority from investigating Deros rationally. Shaver was disinformation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Craig Kennedy {{adds that}} [...] "one key {{difference}} is that of focus. The novel belongs to Sheriff Bell. Each chapter begins with Bell's narration, which dovetails and counterpoints {{the action of the}} main story. Though the film opens with Bell speaking, much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> in the book is condensed and it turns up in other forms. Also, Bell has an entire backstory in the book that doesn't make it into the film. The result is a movie that is more simplified thematically, but one that gives more of the characters an opportunity to shine." ...|$|E

2500|$|The One People's Project {{claims that}} MacDonald has {{promoted}} anti-Semitic propaganda {{under the guise}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> is a legitimate and academic search for truth. He {{has been accused of}} misrepresenting the sources he uses in that regard. For example, Barry Mehler, an educator at Ferris State University, noted that MacDonald had claimed that [...] "Jewish opposition to the 1921 and 1924 legislation (to limit immigration) was motivated less by a desire for higher levels of Jewish immigration than by opposition to the implicit theory that America should be dominated by individuals with northern and western European ancestry." [...] MacDonald based this on a dissertation entitled “American Jewry and United States immigration policy, 1881–1953” by Sheldon Morris Neuringer. Nueringer’s thesis posited that Jewish opposition in 1921 and 1924 to the anti-immigration legislation at the time was due more to it having the [...] "taint of discrimination and anti-Semitism" [...] as opposed to how it would limit Jewish immigration. Mehler stated [...] "It seems to me Mr. MacDonald is misrepresenting Mr. Neuringer in this case and I posted my query hoping that a historian familiar with the literature might have a judgment on MacDonald's use of the historical data."' ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Du Bois's {{speech was}} well {{received}} by most students and alumni in attendance, it angered many alumni, parents of current students and leading Nashville Blacks who disagreed with his assertions. One alumnus, {{the mother of}} a graduating senior, took the podium almost immediately after Du Bois, and, [...] "without mentioning him Du Bois or his talk, expressed herself in exactly the opposite point of view." [...] A 1924 Fisk alumnus declared that he was [...] "heartily opposed to Dr. Du Bois" [...] and considered [...] "his attack upon Dr. McKenzie as a cunning and hellish attempt at self-aggrandizement spurred on by his inherent bent for the precipitation of a crisis." [...] Mrs. Booker T. Washington, a graduate of Fisk who closely followed the school's developments, strongly criticized Du Bois's remarks, calling him a [...] "radical" [...] and asserting he [...] "is not always careful <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> and when he says it." [...] To demonstrate continued Black support, McKenzie published a pamphlet [...] "Letters and Telegrams from Parents of Fisk Students, Alumni, Students and Friends-at-Large Together with Certain Statements Relative to the Recent Disturbances at Fisk University February 4, 1925" [...] containing over 75 reprinted letters from primarily parents and alumni critical of Du Bois and supporting his administration. The pamphlet indicated that all the letters were from Blacks.|$|E

"Not only is <b>he</b> <b>saying</b> {{the right}} thing, {{but with the}} way I feel when he speaks to me, I absorb {{everything}} {{a lot better than}} if it were coming from the average Joe,” Ayala said of Manfredo Sr. “I trust a lot <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>he’s</b> <b>saying.</b> I could literally go in there with a blindfold on and have him {{tell me what to do}} and I would still win the fight.
