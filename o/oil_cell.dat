40|$|The {{grapefruit}} of America {{is first}} described from the East Indies {{about the middle}} part of the eighteenth century, {{but it was not}} botanically named until MACFADYBN, who treated it thoroughly in 1830 under the specific name Citrus paradisi MACF. Obtaining information from TUSSAC, the autho r of Flora Antillarum (1808 - 1827), RISSO and POITEAU named it Citrus pompelmos racemosus in a work published during 1818 - 1822, as a variety of shaddock. Considering that Citrus decumana is the proper name for shaddock, combinations Citrus decumana paradisi NICHOLLS, and Citrus decumana racemosa ROEMER have been proposed. RICCOBONO, in 1908, rejected the use of racemosa because of it is badly chosen, and renamed it as Citrus decumana Patoniana, but of course such name is untenable. DE GREGORIO used Pampelmos for grapefruit as the name of varietal rank, and LELONG presented the name Pomelanus also as variety, claiming that it was adopted from WILLDENOW. Overlooking all of these early nomenclatures, MERRILL and LEE again named graphfruit as Citrus maxima uvacarpa. Many indifferent authors, beginning with LUNAN (1814), included grapefruit in Citrus decumana without distinguishing it by any varietal name. All of these names, except Citrus paradisi, were determined from conception regarding it a botanical variety of shaddock which was first reported by SLOANE (1707) on its origin of introduction into the West Indies. No one except HUME (according t o an informal remark of his conversation) seems to have maintained th at grapefruit is a good species distinguishable from shaddock. Critical study of the writer, however, brought a conclusion that grapefruit is different from shaddock by many distinct essential characters. The grapefruit calyx is well lobed, much smaller, nearly lacking pubescence; fruit is decidedly yellow-colored, not whitish as in shaddock, well flatten at both ends, occasionally providing crator-like stem-end and areolate apex. <b>Oil</b> <b>cell</b> dots of the rind are small, inuniform, even or concave, and contain oil of distinctive aroma. The segments of grapefruit are regular, rounded at the centre; pulp is very distinctly yellow and aromatic, vesicles are small and anastomosing. Seeds are smaller, lighter colored, not dentiform and usually pointed at ends, and contain well marked poly-embryos. The shaddock fruits, on the contrary, are more rounded at both ends, having large calyx with continuous, broken-cut margin. No typical areola and crator depression are found in shaddock fruit, and the <b>oil</b> <b>cell</b> dots of the rind are always convex and never form foveoli. The segments of shaddock fruit are generally irregular, otherwise with the carpel and much pointed at the centre; pulp is white (often rosy), coarsely grained, firm, not juicy, and less refreshing. The pulp vesicles are large and parallel, occasionally intercrossing in the salmon flesh structure, but scarcely anastomosing. Seeds of shaddock are characterised by large dentiform, wedge-shaped outline with strong striations. Poly-embryony has nevern been observed in shaddock. These remarkable distinctions are worthy of bringing grapefruit into the species rank separate from shaddock. Such species is to be defined as a horicultural species, and it is nearly clear that it was originated by chance seedling, most probably from a shaddock seed. It is therefore concluded that Citrus. paradisi MACF. is correct and valid scientific name of grapefruit, now grown in West Indies, North America, Italy, Taiwan and Japan.

Critical examination of the original description and later Dutch and English summary published in Java in 1926, soon revealed that this name is nonvalid, by the reason of (1) the lack of definiteness and clearness of essential specific characters that involves, (2) the founding of species upon aggregate types, each one of which being distinct species, like Citrus depressa HAYATA, Citrus tachibana TANAKA, Citrus kinokuni HORT., Citrus tangerina HORT., Citrus erythrosa HORT., et., (3) the failure of distinguishing the description of the type of the species, thereby causing impossibility to reserve the name, and (4) the impossibility of applying the name to the Koji mikan of Japan by the antagonistic diagnosis such as wild nature, bitterness of the pulp, and the like. Since these points are enough to become the permanent source of error, and since the Koji mikan is a definite horticultural species and must have a name, the author reached {{to the conclusion that the}} name Citrus Coji should be proscribed, and a better name should be chosen for Koji.

Citrus koozi HORT., offered in a paper of the author read before the Third Pan-Pacific Science Congress (based upon Citrus nobilis subsp. Suntara var. Koozi TANAKA. nom. seminud. published in 1912) is withdrawn to avoid further mistake. Citrus nobilis var. Koji found in popular Japanese books is also rejected by being applied to aggregate species lacking the description of the type. From these unfortunate circumstances, the author is compelled to create a new horticultural species Citrus leiocarpa HORT. nov. based upon Tsuchi Koji or Mar Koji of the Japanese gardens, which covers subordinate horticultural varieties Hira Koji (Kin Koji), Suruga Yuko, and Sagami Yuko (Fukure mikan). Citrus leiocarpa is a good horticultural species, being a small thornless tree, dencely convered by broad leaves of medium-small size and acuminate apex. Flower-buds are broad, and their cross section is angular, the calyx lobe of which being much rounded with deep and sharp cut and glabrous margin. Fruits are small, depressed-globose, tumid, much polished and yellewish-orange in color, with smooth, minute <b>oil</b> <b>cell</b> dots. Segments are 8 - 11, regular and moderately thick-walled, leaving small space at the central column; pulp, is deep yellow, narrowly pararell-netted, with juice of mild subacid flavor. Pulp vesicles are long-fusoid, separable and not delicate. Seeds are rather large, ellipsoid, green, not beaked, smooth, containing green polyembryos; tegmen at charaza is marked rosy-brown. Its closest wild relative is Citrus depressa HAYATA, never occurring north of Sanbok (Amami Oshima), which differs from it by having broadly pointed leaves, reddish rind, finely round-netted pectiniferous pulp vesicles, large seeds of brownish coat, and dark-brown charaza part of tegmen. Another wild relative, Citrus tachibana TANAKA of Japan proper, has soft fruit of decidedly small outline, truncate, broadly depressed ends, baggy rind, fewer number of segments, melting acid pulp, short-fusoid extremely delicate pulp vesicles, smaller seeds, and very light-colored charaza part of tegmen.

40|$|The acorn {{barnacle}} Balanus amphitrite is {{a marine}} crustacean with six nauplius and one cyprid larval stages and a sessile adult, that represent {{one of the}} main constituents of sea biofouling. The cyprid is the last larval stage, specialized for settlement, and the study of its biology is interesting also in the frame of antifouling strategies. In this study, a novel approach to the neurobiology of B. amphitrite cyprid has undertaken, studying immunohistochemically the distribution of some G-protein α subunits (Gαs, Gαo Gαi, and Gαq) on B. amphitrite cyprid. Gαs-like immunoreactivity was observed in the intestinal mucosa, oral cone, epithelial cells along the outer face of the mantle and thorax; Gαo into the fibers of the neuropile of the central nervous system; Gαi in <b>oil</b> <b>cells,</b> epithelial cells, and limbs and thorax muscles; Gαq was not detected. The results suggest the involvement of the G-protein α subunits in different tissues and functions that seem to be in agreement with the distribution of the ones from the same class of G-proteins in vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Spathelia-Ptaeroxylon clade is a {{group of}} morphologically diverse plants that have been {{classified}} together as a result of molecular phylogenetic studies. The clade is currently included in Rutaceae and recognized at a subfamilial level (Spathelioideae) despite {{the fact that most of}} its genera have traditionally been associated with other families and that there are no obvious morphological synapomorphies for the clade. The aim of the present study is to construct phylogenetic trees for the Spathelia-Ptaeroxylon clade and to investigate anatomical characters in order to decide whether it should be kept in Rutaceae or recognized at the familial level. Anatomical characters were plotted on a cladogram to help explain character evolution within the group. Moreover, phylogenetic relationships and generic limits within the clade are also addressed. METHODS: A species-level phylogenetic analysis of the Spathelia-Ptaeroxylon clade based on five plastid DNA regions (rbcL, atpB, trnL-trnF, rps 16 and psbA-trnH) was conducted using Bayesian, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. Leaf and seed anatomical characters of all genera were (re) investigated by light and scanning electron microscopy. KEY RESULTS: With the exception of Spathelia, all genera of the Spathelila-Ptaeroxylon clade are monophyletic. The typical leaf and seed anatomical characters of Rutaceae were found. Further, the presence of <b>oil</b> <b>cells</b> in the leaves provides a possible synapomorphy for the clade. CONCLUSIONS: The Spathelia-Ptaeroxylon clade is well placed in Rutaceae and it is reasonable to unite the genera into one subfamily (Spathelioideae). We propose a new tribal classification of Spathelioideae. A narrow circumscription of Spathelia is established to make the genus monophyletic, and Sohnreyia is resurrected to accommodate the South American species of Spathelia. The most recent common ancestor of Spathelioideae probably had leaves with secretory cavities and <b>oil</b> <b>cells,</b> haplostemonous flowers with appendaged staminal filaments, and a tracheidal tegmen...|$|R
