40|$|In Sweden, as {{in other}} industrialised nations, <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> are {{considered}} to be an important tool for chemical risk management, although many other factors also play a role in occupational safety and health management. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> in relation to information about, and the risk perception of, chemicals. An interview study was performed at four Swedish process industry workplaces in order to investigate these issues. For each workplace, the range of informants covered at least one person who spent most of their working time in the production process; one person in a managerial position; one person in the site health, safety and environment department; the main safety ombudsman; and the site manager. The results show that informants' understanding of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> and their use is quite poor, although they do understand that there is epistemic uncertainty in determining the toxicological effects of hazardous substances. The risk perception and safety behaviour of the informants were not affected by the <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits,</b> nor did <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> have any role as sources of information. Nevertheless, almost all the informants expressed the view that <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> are trusted and needed; safety engineers and main safety ombudsmen, generally, also added that <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> are useful. What was found to be most important factor for the informants' perception of risk and safety was trust in specific people, often established through long-term relationships...|$|R
