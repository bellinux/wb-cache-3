5|$|Five {{days after}} the British surrendered, Congress passed a {{resolution}} agreeing to erect a structure dedicated to commemorating {{those who participated in}} the battle. Construction of the monument was delayed, however, as the federal government had several other financial <b>obligations</b> <b>that</b> were considered to be of a more urgent nature. The battle's centennial sparked renewed enthusiasm in the resolution and prompted the government to begin building the monument in 1881 amid national support. The structure was formally erected in 1884 and currently resides within Colonial National Historical Park.|$|E

25|$|For {{native peoples}} like the Māori in New Zealand, there is {{conflict}} between the fluid identity assumed as part of modern society and the traditional identity with the <b>obligations</b> <b>that</b> accompany it; the loss of language heightens the feeling of isolation and damages the ability to perpetuate tradition.|$|E
25|$|The Commission relied chiefly on {{the binding}} legal <b>obligations</b> <b>that</b> the country voluntarily assumed as a State party to the: International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; Convention on the Rights of the Child; and Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The Commission also relied on other {{international}} and customary law, including international humanitarian law.|$|E

25|$|According to the Talmud {{women are}} {{generally}} exempted from <b>obligations</b> <b>that</b> {{have to be}} performed at a certain time. Orthodox authorities have generally interpreted this exemption due to women's higher spiritual level and therefore a lack of need to connect to God at specific times, since they are always connected to God. In accordance with the general exemption from time-bound obligations, most Orthodox authorities have exempted women from performing evening prayers (Maariv), but most believe that women are obligated to pray Shacharit and Mincha, the morning and afternoon prayers, respectively, when possible.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, {{that space}} had been outgrown. A new chapel {{was built for}} $10,000 ($ in modern dollars) in 1897 on Western Avenue near North Main, the same space {{occupied}} by the rectory today. Two years later, in 1899, the chapel petitioned the diocese to separate itself from its parent church, since its congregation was increasingly composed of residents of the area who had no historical connection to the founding church. It was granted later that year and St. Andrew's became its own parish, after agreeing to assume some of the financial <b>obligations</b> <b>that</b> had previously been St. Paul's.|$|E

The licensing of these editions shows various restrictions and <b>obligations</b> <b>that</b> were called complex by licensing expert Freirich Florea. The Enterprise Edition (DB EE), the most expensive of the Database Editions, has the fewest restrictions — but nevertheless has complex licensing.

25|$|For {{many decades}} the correct {{interpretation}} of the articles also caused some controversy among Irish nationalists. Some saw the constitution as placing an enforceable legal obligation on {{the government of the}} Republic to use its influence to actively seek the unification of the island. Invoking Article 2, some Northern Ireland nationalists elected to the UK parliament requested, but were denied, the right to be recognised in the southern parliament (the Oireachtas) as TDs (members of Dáil Éireann). Before 1999, however, the Irish Supreme Court affirmed in consistent rulings that Article 2 created no rights or <b>obligations</b> <b>that</b> were actually enforceable in a court of law.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{traditional}} for each Kent student {{to have a}} job while they are at school.This tradition dates back to {{the early days of the}} school when it was mainly self-sufficient. These are not jobs in the typical sense but are rather different duties and <b>obligations</b> <b>that</b> each student will have. Some jobs are very basic, such as washing tables after dinner or keeping a common room neat. Others are more involved, such as being a student tour guide or being a student computer technician. The job program is an integral part of the school's history and character even if many of the jobs are different than when they were originally created.|$|E
25|$|In most {{corporate}} insolvencies, it {{is likely}} {{that a large number of}} people's jobs rely on continued business. Accordingly, UK labour law touches corporate insolvencies in three main ways. First, employment contracts cannot be changed except when there are good economic, technical or organisational reasons under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006. This matters particularly in the case of a sale of a business' assets. Second, special provisions concern the adoption of employees' contracts by an administrator or other insolvency practitioner, but apparently with various limits on the <b>obligations</b> <b>that</b> survive. Third, employees and their pensions have preferential claims above other creditors' rights, and if this is exhausted may claim money from the National Insurance Fund or the Pension Protection Fund.|$|E

Similarly, Slovakia has only four holy days of <b>obligation</b> <b>that</b> are also public holidays: Christmas, Solemnity of Mary Mother of God, Epiphany and All Saints', leaving it with five working holy days. In the Netherlands, the bishops conference decreed that, with effect from 1 January 1991, the feasts of the Assumption and All Saints, each of which it had previously decided to celebrate on the following Sunday, were to be of obligation as regards Mass, but not for abstaining from work.|$|R
50|$|The main {{impetus for}} change {{throughout}} has been international <b>obligation,</b> <b>that</b> is, response to foreign, rather than domestic, pressure. The {{result has been}} a prolonged, reluctant process of reducing barriers, which has frustrated many of Japan's trading partners.|$|R

This {{consisted of a}} triangular route to Ålesund Airport, Vigra and Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, {{as well as an}} international service to Göteborg Landvetter Airport. Stein Matre bought part of the company in 2000, and decided to bid for some of the public service <b>obligations</b> <b>that</b> were being auctioned away by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The company was awarded two routes, from Bodø Airport to Røst Airport, and from Oslo Airport, Gardermoen to Fagernes Airport, Leirin, taking effect from 1 April 2000. The Røst route resulted in the company having to establish a base at Røst Airport. Starting in November 2000, GuardAir started flights from Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Kristiansund and Ålesund, with one daily service.|$|E
25|$|The Company {{inherited}} a revenue collection {{system from the}} Mughals in which the heaviest proportion of the tax burden fell on the cultivators, with one-third of the production reserved for imperial entitlement; this pre-colonial system became the Company revenue policy's baseline. However, there was vast variation across India in the methods by which the revenues were collected; with this complication in mind, a Committee of Circuit toured the districts of expanded Bengal Presidency {{in order to make}} a five-year settlement, consisting of five-yearly inspections and temporary tax farming. In their overall approach to revenue policy, Company officials were guided by two goals: first, preserving as much as possible the balance of rights and <b>obligations</b> <b>that</b> were traditionally claimed by the farmers who cultivated the land and the various intermediaries who collected tax on the state's behalf and who reserved a cut for themselves; and second, identifying those sectors of the rural economy that would maximise both revenue and security. Although their first revenue settlement turned out to be essentially the same as the more informal pre-existing Mughal one, the Company had created a foundation for the growth of both information and bureaucracy.|$|E

500|$|On June 29, 1954, the AEC {{upheld the}} {{findings}} of the Personnel Security Board, with five commissioners voting in favor and one opposed. The decision was rendered 32 hours before Oppenheimer's consultant contract, and with it the need for a clearance, was due to expire. In his majority opinion, Strauss said that Oppenheimer had displayed [...] "fundamental character defects". He said that Oppenheimer [...] "in his associations had repeatedly exhibited a willful disregard of the normal and proper obligations of security," [...] and that he [...] "has defaulted not once but many times upon the <b>obligations</b> <b>that</b> should and must be willingly borne by citizens in the national service." ...|$|E
500|$|The 836 charter also {{contains}} an early {{reference to the}} trimoda necessitas, the set of three <b>obligations</b> <b>that</b> kings of the era placed on their subjects. [...] These duties were the building of royal residences, the obligation to pay feorm, or food rent, to the king, and hospitality to the king's servants. [...] The privileges granted came at a cost: Wiglaf and one ealdorman received life interests in estates, and another ealdorman was paid six hundred shillings in gold. [...] It is perhaps notable that in common with many other Mercian charters of the 9th century, this grant is of privileges rather than land: the chronicler Bede had commented a century earlier that excessive grants of land to monasteries were leaving kings without land to grant to the nobility, and the Mercian kings may have been responding to this problem.|$|E
500|$|There also {{developed}} <b>obligations</b> <b>that</b> produced smaller numbers of feudal troops. The Davidian Revolution of {{the twelfth century}} was seen by Geoffrey Barrow as bringing [...] "fundamental innovations in military organization". These included the knight's fee, homage and fealty, as well as castle-building and the regular use of professional cavalry, as knights held castles and estates in exchange for service, providing troops on a 40-day basis. David's Norman followers and their retinues were able to provide a force of perhaps 200 mounted and armoured knights, {{but the vast majority}} of his forces were the [...] "common army" [...] of poorly armed infantry, capable of performing well in raiding and guerrilla warfare. Although such troops were only infrequently able to stand up to the English in the field, nonetheless they did manage to do so critically in the wars of independence at Stirling Bridge in 1297 and Bannockburn in 1314.|$|E
