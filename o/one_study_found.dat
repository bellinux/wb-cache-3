5|$|Seed {{germination}} {{rates are}} quite high. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> germination rates better than 77% in most batches tested. Seed {{is likely to}} remain viable for a long time, as seed of the closely related B.cuneata remains viable for around ten years.|$|E
5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E

5|$|Ferraro's womanhood was {{consistently}} discussed during the campaign; <b>one</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that {{a quarter of}} newspaper articles written about her contained gendered language. Throughout, Ferraro kept campaigning, taking on the traditional running mate role of attacking the opposition vigorously. By the end, she had traveled more than Mondale and more than Reagan and Bush combined.|$|E
5|$|In many {{temperate}} regions, beavers play {{an essential}} hydrological role. When building their dams and lodges, beavers alter {{the paths of}} streams and rivers and allow {{for the creation of}} extensive wetland habitats. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that engineering by beavers leads to a 33 percent {{increase in the number of}} herbaceous plant species in riparian areas. Another study found that beavers increase wild salmon populations.|$|E
5|$|Spaying or neutering {{increases}} life expectancy: <b>one</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> neutered male cats live {{twice as}} long as intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females. Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemical}} changes {{associated with}} infection of a tumor or its surrounding tissue can cause rapidly escalating pain, but infection is sometimes overlooked {{as a possible}} cause. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that infection {{was the cause of}} pain in four percent of nearly 300 people with cancer who were referred for pain relief. Another report described seven people with cancer, whose previously well-controlled pain escalated significantly over several days. Antibiotic treatment produced pain relief in all of them within three days.|$|E
5|$|The {{limitations}} on resources available {{in developing countries}} are particularly evident {{in the area of}} emergency transport. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries. Indeed, there may be no roads at all. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that modes of transport as diverse as motorboats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts were used for emergency transport.|$|E
5|$|When hunting, banded sea kraits {{frequently}} {{head into}} deep water far from land, but return {{to land in}} order to digest, shed skin, and reproduce. Individual banded sea kraits return to their specific home islands, exhibiting philopatry. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that when banded sea kraits on Fijian islands were relocated to different islands 5.3km away, all recaptured individuals were found on their home islands in an average of 30.7 days.|$|E

5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E
5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. American goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is {{despite the fact}} that the American goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough nutrition; the seed-rich diet of American goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.|$|E
5|$|Many animals prey on marsh rice rats. The {{barn owl}} (Tyto alba) {{is among the}} most important; <b>one</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that 97.5% of {{vertebrate}} remains in barn owl pellets were marsh rice rats. Other predators include birds (marsh hawks, Circus cyaneus; and barred owls, Strix varia), snakes (cottonmouth moccasins, Agkistrodon piscivorus; and others), alligators, and carnivorans (raccoons, Procyon lotor; red foxes, Vulpes vulpes; minks, Neovison vison; weasels of the genus Mustela; and striped skunks, Mephitis mephitis). Many parasites have been recorded on the marsh rice rat, including various ticks and mites, lice, and fleas among external parasites and many nematodes and digeneans, a pentastomid, and several coccidians among internal parasites (see parasites of the marsh rice rat).|$|E

5|$|<b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> {{that people}} with or without {{hypertension}} who excreted less than 3 grams of sodium per day in their urine (and therefore were taking in less than 3g/d) had {{a higher risk of}} death, stroke, or heart attack than those excreting 4 to 5 grams per day. Levels of 7g per day or more in people with hypertension were associated with higher mortality and cardiovascular events, but this was not found to be true for people without hypertension. The US FDA states that adults with hypertension and prehypertension should reduce daily intake to 1.5g.|$|E
5|$|Pain is {{experienced}} by 53 {{percent of all}} people diagnosed with malignant cancer, 59 percent of people receiving anticancer treatment, 64 percent of people with metastatic or advanced-stage disease, and 33 percent of people after completion of curative treatment. Evidence for prevalence of pain in newly diagnosed cancer is scarce. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> pain in 38 {{percent of people who}} were newly diagnosed, another found 35 percent of such people had experienced pain in the preceding two weeks, while another reported that pain was an early symptom in 18â€“49 percent of cases. More than one third of people with cancer pain describe the pain as moderate or severe.|$|E
5|$|Populations are dense in {{the higher}} {{mountain}} regions of Tasmania. Widespread throughout the state, their presence is known on King Island, located north-west from Tasmania. The ant prefers rural areas, found in warm, dry, open eucalypt woodlands; the climate provides the ant with isolation and warmth. This environment also produces the ant's food, which includes nectar and invertebrate prey. In suburban areas, this ant is found in native vegetation, and use rockeries, cracks in concrete walls, dry dirt and grass to build nests. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> suburbs with voluminous vegetation cover such as Mount Nelson, Fern Tree and West Hobart host jack jumper populations, while the heavily urbanised suburbs of North Hobart and Battery Point, do not.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{have not}} found an overall benefit in the general {{population}} of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never having had a heart attack or stroke in the past. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that among those who have never had a heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from having a non-fatal heart attack or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to have a non-fatal bleeding event. However, the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who had never had a heart attack or stroke.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat {{may have}} {{external}} parasites, mostly ticks and fleas, and often carries the parasites of its prey, {{especially those of}} rabbits and squirrels. Internal parasites (endoparasites) are especially common in bobcats. <b>One</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> an average infection rate of 52% from Toxoplasma gondii, but with great regional variation. One mite in particular, Lynxacarus morlani, has to date been found only on the bobcat. Parasites' and diseases' role in the mortality of the bobcat is still unclear, but they may account for greater mortality than starvation, accidents, and predation.|$|E
5|$|The mirror neuron system (MNS) theory hypothesizes that {{alterations}} to {{the development}} of the MNS interfere with imitation and lead to Asperger's core feature of social impairment. For example, <b>one</b> <b>study</b> <b>found</b> that activation is delayed in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with AS. This theory maps well to social cognition theories like the theory of mind, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from impairments in ascribing mental states to oneself and others, or hyper-systemizing, which hypothesizes that autistic individuals can systematize internal operation to handle internal events but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents.|$|E
