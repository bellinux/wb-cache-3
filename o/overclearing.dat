Marsh warned of the deleterious erosional consequences of the <b>overclearing</b> of vegetation. The Fleurieu Peninsula, eighty kilometres south of Adelaide, South Australia, affords the opportunity to study in detail the results of man's activity upon the landscape, wrought by settlement {{in the second half}} of the last century. Cleared initially for the growing of wheat, the area now shows the consequences of erosion. in the form of deep gullies and mass-movements. Gullying results from the concentration of run-off in the vertical furrows employed before the introduction of contour ploughing. Landsliding is considered the most significant process of mass-movement operating in the area and while there has not been a disaster in the sense of loss of life such as occurred in Hong Kong (So, 1971) or Yungay, Peru, where twenty five thousand are known to have perished (Cooke &Townshend, 1970), landsliding represents a serious economic loss of productive land. With gullying, it is estimated by Campana (1954) that landsliding causes a twenty percent reduction of arable land. These landslides pose a number of problems, first in relation to distribution, morphology and active and passive causes as suggested by Sharpe (1938) and second to the time lapse between the initial clearing and subsequent movement of the land. These problems are investigated in this study. Thesis (B. Sc. (Hons)) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Social Sciences, 197...|$|E

40|$|Methods {{used for}} sample storage, {{specimen}} clearing, slide mounting, species illustration and morphometric description in alpha-taxonomic studies {{are essential for}} the Eriophyoidea. Eriophyoid mites are very tiny and delicate, for which truly permanent specimen slides currently cannot be prepared, resulting in eventual loss of material, including type specimens. Often, published descriptions and drawings have not achieved the required level of quality, and thus many relevant taxonomic details have been permanently lost or neglected. These shortcomings can make certain identifications impossible and cause significant confusion. Consequently, there is a considerable need for accurate and uniform descriptive and illustrative data for the Eriophyoidea. Based on their expertise on this topic, the authors provide guidelines and advices, assisted also by illustrations, of the main critical aspects in managing eriophyoid mites in order to supplement and improve techniques for handling and preparation of specimens, and for improving their taxonomic study. The effects of the short- and long-term preservation methods (i. e., fresh, dried and liquid preservative choices) on digesting the internal tissues of the mites are discussed. Clearing and mounting procedures are analyzed, and special tips are suggested for handling mites and designing tools needed during these steps. Methods for recovering specimens from unsuitable slides (i. e., undercleared and <b>overcleared</b> specimens) are proposed and described. Techniques and tricks to produce descriptive line drawings of good quality are highlighted, and the content to include in plates is stressed. Finally, detailed instructions for standardization of measurements are given...|$|R

We believe such a moment exists today {{in the management of}} Australia’s natural environment. The opportunity exists because over the past decade there has been a quiet revolution taking place in rural Australia. Australians are learning about our continent, the adaptability of its biodiversity and the value of this natural heritage to the economic future of city and country people alike. Today, there are thousands of farmers who want to restore our damaged rivers and landscapes and create a new model of sustainability that would become the envy of other nations. These people have energy, commitment and ideas, but they lack resources and scientific advice and are disempowered by the existing bureaucratic environment. The real debate about land clearing is not about trees, it’s about better management of native vegetation so that farmers can protect our rivers which produce fresh water and manage our land so they can continue to produce the food we eat and the clothes we wear. The vast majority of this continent is managed by individual landowners (both black and white). They make decisions every day that either benefit or damage the long term future of our natural resource base. Fundamental to the success of a new model for landscape management is simplifying the overwhelmingly complex structures that exist at present, to empower the farming community {{to take control of the}} problem, to back them with first class science and provide them with adequate public funds to deliver on-ground solutions on the farm. The Wentworth Group proposes a radically new way of managing native vegetation in New South Wales. This model not only seeks to resolve the current conflict over land clearing in a fair and equitable way, it also looks at the bigger picture of an urgent need for a major investment in revegetation of <b>overcleared</b> landscapes. The model is underpinned by tougher laws on land clearing, but is focused on providing farmers with investment security and the funding support they need. The Wentworth Model for Landscape Conservation has five interdependent components: 	strengthening and simplifying native vegetation regulations, ending the broadscale clearing of remnant vegetation and protected regrowth; 	setting environmental standards and clarifying responsibilities for native vegetation management which will, over time, create healthy rivers and catchments; 	using property management plans to provide investment security, management flexibility and financial support for farmers; 	providing significant levels of public funding to farmers to help meet new environmental standards and support on-ground conservation; 	restructuring institutions by improving scientific input into policy setting, improving information systems, and regionalising administration. The Wentworth model is founded on simplicity and flexibility, it balances investment security with high environmental standards, and it replaces perverse incentives to clear native vegetation with economic incentives to produce better environmental results...|$|R
