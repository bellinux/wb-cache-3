5|$|Horowitz {{points out}} that the film's {{dichotomy}} of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust. Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, The Restaurant {{was awarded}} three Michelin stars. White {{claimed to have}} become the youngest chef ever to have won a third star, but this was later disputed by Heinz Winkler. The same year, Ladenis also won his third star at fellow Rocco Forte hotel based restaurant Chez Nico. The media response {{at the time was}} to criticise White <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that despite his restaurant serving French cuisine, White had never travelled to France. White had actually travelled through France on trains, for family holidays in Italy with his mother as a child.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{behind the}} church is Tre Kronor castle. Destroyed by fire in 1697 and {{subsequently}} replaced by the Stockholm Palace, it was named after the central citadel, a large gun tower emblazoned with the Three Crowns symbol, known as the first building in Stockholm and a symbol for the Swedish Crown. While {{it is not known}} when the symbol was first added to the citadel (it became the national coat of arms in the late 14th century), it was gilded during the 16th century. Again, the painting is strictly accurate, as the 1540s enlargement of the tower is not present in the image. The castle's eastern wing, the king's personal residence, was destroyed by fire in 1525 and in letters ten years later the king, burdened by debts of war to Lübeck, expressed his indignation <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the reconstruction was still not completed. In the painting {{to the right of the}} church the eastern wing is accurately depicted as under construction, the exposed roof trusses confirming the inconvenience experienced by the monarch.|$|E

5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) is {{organizing}} {{the making of}} a time capsule, meant to be opened 50 years in the future and filled with items that encapsulate the spirit of Pawnee. A citizen named Kelly Larson (Will Forte) comes to Leslie's office and makes a passionate plea for the Twilight books to be included. When Leslie refuses because the books have no connection to Pawnee, Kelly handcuffs himself to a pipe in her office until she reconsiders. He is able to stay several days because he brought food, water and a pillow. During his stay, Kelly notices Tom (Aziz Ansari) appears sad, and correctly deduces Tom is having romantic issues; Tom's girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) has dumped him because Tom cannot get <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that his ex-wife, Wendy (Jama Williamson), is dating Ron (Nick Offerman). Kelly encourages Tom to read Twilight, to which he initially scoffs, but after reading them finds he loves the books. Lucy later visits Tom and tells him she still likes him, and if he ever gets past his Ron & Wendy-jealousy problems he should call her.|$|E
5|$|While Governor Pataki {{supported}} this revised, $1.5 billion people mover plan, Mayor Rudy Giuliani voiced his opposition <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that it was}} not a direct rail link from Manhattan, and thus would not be profitable because of the need to transfer from Jamaica. Additionally, Giuliani did not like that the city had to effectively pay $300 million toward the new light rail system. The Port Authority was originally planning to pay for only $1.2 billion of the project, with the other $300 million to be used to pay the rent at the airport instead. In order to give his agreement, Giuliani wanted the Port Authority to study the possibility of extending the Astoria elevated to LaGuardia Airport, as well as make the light-rail system compatible with the subway or LIRR to allow possible future interoperability. In late 1997, Giuliani agreed to the plan under the condition that the state reimburse the city $300 million of the system's cost, with the city paying the $300 million for the line from 2002 through 2017. As part of the agreement, the state would also conduct a study on a similar train link to LaGuardia Airport.|$|E
5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a Manicure is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} by everything around her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Homer doesn't {{have any interest in}} auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no one cares for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge by pointing out that they knew he was a victim in her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E

He openly criticised Serbian, Croatian and Slovene nationalism.|$|E
30|$|The {{problem here}} is that while {{we may be able to}} see stories as falsified history, we do not see History (with a capital H) as a {{collection}} of falsified stories. What happens in nationalistic history-writing is that a story takes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> (including <b>the</b> language) and becomes institutionalized as history. I will illustrate this with a piece of historicized story-telling, the (his)story of the American South.|$|R

Watson admits in convincing Holmes, [...] "A little diplomacy was needed," [...] for Holmes resists anything that sounds like coddling or sentimentalism. Watson also glosses <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of Holmes' illness from overwork, implying redundancy because all of Europe was [...] "ringing with his name." ...|$|R

25|$|George Rapp had {{an eloquent}} style, which matched his {{commanding}} presence, {{and he was}} the personality that led the group through all the different settlements.

25|$|Danforth {{did not sit}} on the Court of Oyer and Terminer. In fact he is {{recorded}} as being critical of {{the conduct of the}} trials, and played a role in bringing them to an end.

In real life, the Putnams (who both died in 1699) were survived by ten of their twelve children, including Ann Jr., who, in 1706, issued perhaps the most heartfelt apology of any accuser. Thomas Putnam's conduct during the witch trial hysteria has been amply documented to have been almost entirely due to financial motivations and score-settling, something the play only makes reference to after introducing the Putnams' fictional deceased offspring as part of the plot narrative.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine William James's theory of {{personal}} identity.

James's ultimate commitment is to the unassailable nature of <b>the</b> basic <b>facts</b> of consciousness. He rejects the theories offered by both Hume and Kant because of their inability to account for basic indubitable characteristics of thought. However, I also show how James's own theory of personal identity also runs its philosophical commitments <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of consciousness. My aim here is to show the dangers inherent in any attempt to provide philosophical mechanisms designed to explain the nature of selfhood...|$|R
