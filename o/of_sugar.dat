50|$|Measurement {{of carbon}} isotopic ratios {{can be used}} for {{detection}} of adulteration of honey.

5|$|Refined {{sugar is}} widely used for {{industrial}} needs for higher quality. Refined sugar is purer (ICUMSA below 300) than raw sugar (ICUMSA over 1,500).

5|$|Another {{commodity}} {{that was}} a prominent source of trade was the production <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> from the crop sugar cane. The original habitat <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> was in India, where it was taken and planted in various islands. Once reaching {{to the people of}} the Iberian Peninsula, it was further migrated across the Atlantic Ocean. In the 16th century, the first plantations <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> were started in the New World, marking the last great stage of migration of the cane to the West. Because of the conflict of transporting sugar in its raw form, sugar was not associated with commerce until the act of refining it came into play; this act became the center for industry. Venice was the center for refining during the Middle Ages, therefore making them the chief traders <b>of</b> <b>sugar.</b> Although, the Spanish and Portuguese held the monopolies of the sugar cane fields in America, they were being supplied by Venice. In the 17th century, England dominated Venice and became the center for refining and cultivating sugar; this leadership was maintained until the rise of French industry. Sugar throughout the 17th century was still considered a luxury until the latter half of the 17th century when the sugar was being produced in mass quantities making it available to the mass of the English people. This turn of events made the sugar a commodity, because the crop was not being used in only special occasion, but in all daily meals.|$|E
40|$|We report amperometric {{determination}} <b>of</b> <b>sugars</b> {{by using}} a disposable barrel plating nickel electrode (Ni-BPE) in this study. The activated Ni-BPE possesses good reproducibility in flow injection analysis <b>of</b> <b>sugars</b> with a relative standard deviation of 3. 16 % for 10 consecutive injections of glucose. The electrocatalytic mechanism for the detection <b>of</b> <b>sugars</b> as welt as the use as a detector in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is investigated. We achieve a good separation <b>of</b> four <b>sugars</b> (glucose, fructose, sucrose, and maltose) in HPLC with favorable sensitivity at a detection potential of + 0. 55 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The results of wide linear calibration ranges and detection limits in the mu M range meet the need of real sample analysis. This detection method is successfully used for quantitative determination <b>of</b> <b>sugars</b> in honey to identify its authentication...|$|R

5|$|In {{the fall}} of the year 1799, a {{translation}} of Franz Carl Achard's ground-breaking work on the production <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> from beets appeared in Nicholson's Journal. Until that time, sugar cane, which was grown overseas, was the only plant from which sugar could be derived. This information made possible the creation of a domestic sugar industry, and was greeted with great interest. A short time after the article's publication, Accum had samples of beet sugar sent from Berlin, and presented them to William Nicholson. This was the first time sugar derived from beets had ever been present in England. Following his careful analysis of both types <b>of</b> <b>sugar,</b> Nicholson published a detailed report in the January edition of his journal, stating that there was no appreciable difference in taste between the two.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the late}} nineteenth century, sugar was {{purchased}} in loaves, {{which had to be}} cut using implements called sugar nips. In later years, granulated sugar was more usually sold in bags. Sugar cubes were produced in the nineteenth century. The first inventor of a process to make sugar in cube form was the Moravian Jakub Kryštof Rad, director of a sugar company in Dačice. He began sugar cube production after being granted a five-year patent for the process on January 23, 1843. Henry Tate of Tate & Lyle was another early manufacturer <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> cubes at his refineries in Liverpool and London.
