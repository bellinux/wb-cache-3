30|$|It {{is noted}} that, without {{including}} {{the effect of}} root reinforcement in <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> stability analysis (i.e. Case 1), the computed FOS for <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> is 1.05, which indicates <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> is marginally stable. When vegetation grows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>slope</b> (i.e. Case 8), the FOS increases from 1.05 to 1.25 (i.e. 19  % increase), which has the most significant increase in FOS among all other cases. This {{is followed by the}} case with vegetation growing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> surface and toe (i.e. Case 4) and, in this case, the FOS increased to 1.2 (i.e. 15  % increase). However, when vegetation was grown only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> surface (i.e. Case 2) or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>slope</b> region (i.e. Case 5), the increase in FOS was only 3  %. Furthermore, when vegetation was grown only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> toe (i.e. Case 3) or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>slope</b> region (i.e. Case 6), no improvement in FOS was observed. These results suggest that vegetation should be grown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> entire ground surface of a slope or at least <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> surface and toe, so that the beneficial effect of <b>the</b> root reinforcement <b>on</b> <b>slope</b> stability can be obtained.|$|R

Over the centuries, the city has changed hands: being conquered and ruled by the Phoenicians, Persians, Hasmoneans, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Crusaders, Ottomans, British, and the Israelis.

Progress was slowed by mines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> of the bluff, but elements of all three rifle companies, as well as a stray section of G/116, had gained the top by 09:00, causing the defenders at WN-62 to mistakenly report that both WN-65 and WN-66 had been taken.|$|E

5|$|The highest forested zone on the volcano, at an {{elevation}} of , is dominated by māmane (Sophora chrysophylla) and naio (Myoporum sandwicense), both endemic tree species, and is thus known as māmane–naio forest. Māmane seeds and naio fruit are the chief foods of the birds in this zone, especially the palila (Loxioides bailleui). The palila was formerly found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> of Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, and Hualālai, but is now confined to the slopes of Mauna Kea—only 10% of its former range—and has been declared critically endangered.|$|E
5|$|The {{native forest}} in the Canberra region was almost wholly {{eucalypt}} species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials {{of a number of}} species including Pinus radiata <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.|$|E
