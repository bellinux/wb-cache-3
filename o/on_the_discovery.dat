5|$|Recent studies, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of a {{penny of}} Eanred {{for which a}} date no earlier than c. 850 is proposed, suggest a very {{different}} dating for ninth-century Northumbrian kings. From this, {{it is argued that}} Eardwulf's second reign ended circa 830, rather than in the years soon after 810, and that the reigns of subsequent kings should be re-dated accordingly: Eanred from 830 to 854, Æthelred II from 854 to 862, Rædwulf in 858, and Osberht from 862 to 867.|$|E

5|$|The {{first episode}} of Son of God {{shown in the}} UK gained sixmillion viewers and an {{audience}} share of 25%, which was considered high for a religious documentary. During its American broadcast <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Discovery</b> Channel, the series was watched by 12million. It was repeated in the US during March the following year, and gained a figure of 1.5million viewers per episode. The series was nominated for two awards, both for the computer-generated images created by graphics team Red Vision: it was first nominated at the 2001 LEAF Awards, then won an Outstanding Achievement award at the 2001 Royal Television Society North Awards.|$|E

Realising that the object is in fact an ancient Martian spacecraft, Quatermass deduces that the aliens have influenced human evolution and the development of human intelligence. The spacecraft has an intelligence of its own, and once uncovered begins to exert a malign influence, resurrecting Martian memories and instincts buried deep within the human psyche.|$|E

5|$|Bruce paid two further {{visits to}} Spitsbergen, in 1912 and 1914, but the {{outbreak}} of war prevented further immediate developments. However, early in 1919 the old syndicate {{was replaced by a}} larger and better-financed company. Bruce had now fixed his main hopes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of oil, but scientific expeditions in 1919 and 1920 failed to provide evidence of its presence, although substantial new deposits of coal and iron ore were discovered. Thereafter Bruce was too ill to continue with his involvement. The new company had expended most of its capital on these prospecting ventures, and although it continued to exist, under various ownerships, until 1952, there is no record of profitable extraction. Its assets and claims were finally acquired by a rival concern.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the series was mixed. While some reviewers praised the programme for being worthy of its publicity by focusing on history rather than spirituality, others remarked that it was dumbed down and went off on strange tangents. The reliability of the facial reconstruction was also questioned. Son of God first aired in the UK on BBC One during April 2001, where it received a viewership of sixmillion and an audience share of 25%. In the United States, the series was shown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Discovery</b> Channel under the name Jesus: The Complete Story as a single three-hour programme, two weeks after its UK broadcast. The show was also licensed to countries including France, Denmark and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|However, Markham {{had second}} thoughts, {{and was soon}} writing to the current RGS president, Leonard Darwin, to express disbelief about Shackleton's claimed latitudes, repeating these doubts to Scott. Historians have surmised that Scott was Markham's protégé, and {{that the old man}} resented polar glory going to someone else. Whatever his reason, Markham adopted a {{bitterness}} towards Shackleton which he retained {{for the rest of his}} life. He is said to have crossed out all favourable references to Shackleton in his own notes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Discovery</b> expedition, and to have virtually ignored Shackleton's achievements in a 1912 address to the British Association. He was equally dismissive in his history of Antarctic exploration, The Lands of Silence (published posthumously in 1921).|$|E

5|$|In May 2009, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party {{reported}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of copernicium {{and acknowledged}} {{the discovery of}} the isotope 283Cn. This implied the de facto discovery of the livermorium-291 isotope, from the acknowledgment of the data relating to its granddaughter 283Cn, although the livermorium data was not absolutely critical for the demonstration of copernicium's discovery. Also in 2009, confirmation from Berkeley and the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Germany came for the flerovium isotopes 286 to 289, immediate daughters of the four known livermorium isotopes. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 2000–2006. Whereas they found the earliest data (not involving 291Lv and 283Cn) inconclusive, the results of 2004–2006 were accepted as identification of livermorium, and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, the Joint Working Party (JWP) of IUPAC {{published}} a report <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of copernicium {{in which they}} acknowledged {{the discovery of the}} isotope 283Cn.

The discovery of the isotopes flerovium-286 and -287 was confirmed in January 2009 at Berkeley. This was followed by confirmation of flerovium-288 and -289 in July 2009 at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Germany. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 1999–2007.

5|$|Shackleton's {{choice of}} a four-man team for the {{southern}} journey to the South Pole was largely determined {{by the number of}} surviving ponies. Influenced by his experiences <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Discovery</b> Expedition, he had put his confidence in ponies rather than dogs for the long polar march. The motor car, which ran well on flat ice, could not cope with Barrier surfaces and was not considered for the polar journey. The men chosen by Shackleton to accompany him were Marshall, Adams and Wild. Joyce, whose Antarctic experience exceeded all save Wild's, was excluded from the party after Marshall's medical examination raised doubts about his fitness.|$|E

5|$|The liquid thermal {{diffusion}} process was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> by Carl Ludwig in 1856 and later Charles Soret in 1879, that when a temperature gradient is maintained in an originally homogeneous salt solution, after a time, a concentration gradient will also exist in the solution. This is generally known today as the Soret effect. David Enskog in 1911 and Sydney Chapman in 1916 independently developed the Chapman–Enskog theory, which explained that when a mixture of two gases passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier gas tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter gas at the warm end. This was experimentally confirmed by Chapman and F.W. Dootson in 1916.|$|E
5|$|He had eleven known children, all by Elizabeth. His eldest son, and heir, John, Earl of Lincoln (c. 1462–16 June 1487), eventually, due to King Richard III {{losing his}} own son, became heir to his {{maternal}} uncle's throne. Following Richard's death at Bosworth Field, Lincoln rebelled {{against the new}} king Henry VII, and himself was killed at the Battle of Stoke. John de la Pole's second son, Geoffrey, was born circa 1464, but died young. Next, Edward (1466–1485) joined the church and became Archdeacon of Richmond. John de la Pole's first daughter, Elizabeth (c. 1468–1489), married Henry Lovel, 8th Baron Morley (1466–1489), and had no issue. John's dukedom descended to his fourth son, Edmund (1471–30 April 1513), who had to bargain energetically with the king and pay a substantial amount before it was granted. He eventually became a Yorkist pretender to Henry VIII's crown, who had him beheaded. Another daughter, Dorothy, {{who was born in}} 1472, died young, whilst next, Humphrey (1474–1513) took Holy Orders, while Anne (1476–1495) became a nun. John's final daughter, Katherine (c. 1477–1513), made a good marriage to William, Baron Stourton, with whom she had no issue. John de la Pole's two youngest sons both seem to have been involved in a plot against Henry VII that was discovered in 1501. Sir William de la Pole, of Wingfield Castle (1478–1539) was imprisoned in the Tower of London, for thirty-seven years. Before this he had married Katherine Stourton; she was twenty years older than him, and they had no issue. The youngest son, Richard de la Pole (1480–1525), managed to escape to France <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of the 1501 plot. Taking part in France's campaigns during the Italian Wars, he was killed at the Battle of Pavia, 24 February 1525.|$|E
5|$|The Sommerfeld {{model and}} spin models for {{ferromagnetism}} illustrated the successful application {{of quantum mechanics}} to condensed matter problems in the 1930s. However, there still were several unsolved problems, most notably the description of superconductivity and the Kondo effect. After World War II, several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems. These included recognition of collective excitation modes of solids and the important notion of a quasiparticle. Russian physicist Lev Landau used {{the idea for the}} Fermi liquid theory wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now termed Landau-quasiparticles. Landau also developed a mean field theory for continuous phase transitions, which described ordered phases as spontaneous breakdown of symmetry. The theory also introduced the notion of an order parameter to distinguish between ordered phases. Eventually in 1965, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and John Schrieffer developed the so-called BCS theory of superconductivity, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> that arbitrarily small attraction between two electrons of opposite spin mediated by phonons in the lattice can give rise to a bound state called a Cooper pair.|$|E
