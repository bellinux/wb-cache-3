40|$|When {{more and}} more people use web-based {{information}}, information of how they use the information is also available in the form of log data. Analysing such data can help information provider to understand their clients’ interests over the information space being served, and adapt it according to users point of view. This paper describes a novel way of applying data mining techniques on Internet logging data in order to find correlated web sections from users’ point of view. We explain how data from the log file can be transformed into a set of transactional click-streams and how data mining techniques can be applied on these transactions. A test bed has been developed for transforming web log data and discovering association rules from it. Real log data from Microsoft web site is used in experiments and evaluation results show that the approach is effective in obtaining useful knowledge of users correlated interests at a particular web site. We also make some effort on mining <b>other</b> <b>service</b> <b>log</b> data obtained from IRAIA project, an information retrieval system serving economical data...|$|R

40|$|The ALMA Common Software (ACS) is a {{software}} framework {{that provides the}} infrastructure for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and other projects. ACS, based on CORBA, offers basic services and common design patterns for distributed software. Every properly built system {{needs to be able}} to log status and error information. Logging in a single computer scenario can be as easy as using fprintf statements. However, in a distributed system, it must provide a way to centralize all logging data in a single place without overloading the network nor complicating the applications. ACS provides a complete <b>logging</b> <b>service</b> infrastructure in which every log has an associated priority and timestamp, allowing filtering at different levels of the system (application, service and clients). Currently the ACS <b>logging</b> <b>service</b> uses an implementation of the CORBA Telecom <b>Log</b> <b>Service</b> in a customized way, using only a minimal subset of the features provided by the standard. The most relevant feature used by ACS is the ability to treat the logs as event data that gets distributed over the network in a publisher-subscriber paradigm. For this purpose the CORBA Notification Service, which is resource intensive, is used. On the other hand, the Data Distribution Service (DDS) provides an alternative standard for publisher-subscriber communication for real-time systems, offering better performance and featuring decentralized message processing. The current document describes how the new high performance <b>logging</b> <b>service</b> of ACS has been modeled and developed using DDS, replacing the Telecom <b>Log</b> <b>Service.</b> Benefits and drawbacks are analyzed.

A previous version of this utility was rarely used for various reasons, herein explained. The lessons learned set the grounds and motivation for a new redesign. The <b>Log</b> <b>Service</b> consists of the Logger, the entity that collects logs and stores them in an Oracle database; a set of user utilities to access and maintain the database; and a Java based tool, known as the Log Manager, which provides a compact and intuitive interface for browsing the log messages based on a user defined search criteria. The outline of these software components are explained, including various optimization techniques deployed in order to handle the large volume of entries expected to be stored in the database.

50|$|The <b>Log</b> <b>Service</b> enables {{applications}} to express and write log records through log streams {{that lead to}} particular output destinations, such as a named file. Once at the output destination, a log record is subject to output formatting rules, which are configurable and public. The logging application {{does not need to}} be aware of any of these aspects (e.g. the destination file location, file rotation or formatting, etc.) as the <b>Log</b> <b>Service</b> handles them based on the current settings for the targeted log stream. Since the output format is public, third party tools can read these log files.|$|R

Vern Jones was the company's first president. EXLOG would become a world leader in surface logging, rig instrumentation and data acquisition. Baker International acquired EXLOG in 1972, and invested in its expansion. By 1982, the company had more than 200 logging units and 1,000 geologists on staff.

40|$|In {{the online}} world, {{increasing}} amounts of personal data of users are processed by service providers and other third party data processors. The privacy principle of transparency means that users should be informed about what data about them are processed by whom and how. This report describes a <b>log</b> <b>service</b> that enables users to reconstruct a log trail of these actions, by retrieving log entries from log servers. The information that links log entries into a trail is logged — together with the encrypted action data — to dedicated log servers by the data processors. In the proposed <b>service,</b> <b>log</b> entries of one trail can be spread over different log servers, possibly generated by different data processors. The fact that certain information is logged about a user can already leak information, and adding linking information only elevates this privacy risk. Encrypting the logged information does not suffice to protect against this. In our system, linking information across log databases is cryptographically protected and is only meaningful to the user to whom the log entries relate. In the report, we also {{consider the fact that}} log servers and data processors can become compromised. The scheme is therefore auditable, meaning that a third party can validate that log servers cannot make any changes to log entries without being detected, even when they collude with <b>other</b> <b>log</b> servers or data processors.

40|$|Reusability, {{reliability}} and flexibility {{are the key}} concerns in component based development. Moreover components should not affect the functionality of other components. So {{to address these issues}} software component models were introduced. This component based approach is also used in embedded real time systems. But due to recourse restrictions, traditional component models have a small domain. This problem is resolved by introducing a new software component services approach extending the functionality of already available component models. In my thesis I created a visual studio add-in which extended the functionality of a COM type library and provided the <b>logging</b> <b>service</b> for ATL smart device. It reads the classes and methods of the COM type library and then adds <b>logging</b> <b>service</b> using proxy objects. Then I tested my add-in with a managed client of a simple calculator. First I used the simple COM type library with the managed client and then I used it with my add-in’s output. The result in both cases were same so it’s clear that my add-in didn’t alter the basic functionality of the COM type library it just added the <b>logging</b> <b>service</b> to it. ...|$|R

40|$|The CERN {{accelerator}} <b>Logging</b> <b>Service</b> currently holds {{more than}} 90 terabytes of data online, and processes approximately 450 gigabytes per day, via hundreds of data loading processes and data extraction requests. This service is mission-critical for day-to-day operations, especially {{with respect to}} the tracking of live data from the LHC beam and equipment. In order to effectively manage any service, the service provider’s goals should include knowing how the underlying systems are being used, in terms of: “Who is doing what, from where, using which applications and methods, and how long each action takes”. Armed with such information, it is then possible to: analyse and tune system performance over time; plan for scalability ahead of time; assess the impact of maintenance operations and infrastructure upgrades; diagnose past, on-going, or re-occurring problems. The <b>Logging</b> <b>Service</b> is based on Oracle DBMS and Application Servers, and Java technology, and is comprised of several layered and multi-tiered systems. These systems have all been heavily instrumented to capture data about system usage, using technologies such as JMX.
