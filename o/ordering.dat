5|$|Topological sorting is the {{algorithmic}} {{problem of}} finding a topological <b>ordering</b> of a given DAG. It can be solved in linear time. Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting builds the vertex <b>ordering</b> directly. It maintains a list of vertices that have no incoming edges from other vertices that have not already {{been included in the}} partially constructed topological ordering; initially this list consists of the vertices with no incoming edges at all. Then, it repeatedly adds one vertex from this list {{to the end of the}} partially constructed topological <b>ordering,</b> and checks whether its neighbors should be added to the list. The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been processed in this way. Alternatively, a topological <b>ordering</b> may be constructed by reversing a postorder numbering of a depth-first search graph traversal.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{directly}} <b>ordering</b> {{the aircraft}} from McDonnell Douglas, the Australian Government purchased its F/A-18s through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. <b>Ordering</b> the aircraft via the US Government allowed the RAAF {{to take advantage}} of the superior purchasing power of the US military, and reduced the service's project management requirements. This led to a complicated arrangement whereby the aircraft were ordered by the US Government, delivered to the US Navy, and then transferred to the RAAF once initial flight testing had taken place. The process functioned smoothly, however, and was cost effective.|$|E
