5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping <b>oil</b> in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global <b>oil</b> prices. This is partly because it took several years to reach full production and partly because U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS production increases. <b>Oil</b> prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of price controls, and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s <b>oil</b> glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. <b>oil</b> production. As North Slope <b>oil</b> production declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. <b>oil</b> production.|$|E
5|$|An <b>oil</b> tanker, {{also known}} as a {{petroleum}} tanker, is a merchant ship designed for the bulk transport of <b>oil.</b> There are two basic types of <b>oil</b> tankers: crude tankers and product tankers. Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude <b>oil</b> from its point of extraction to refineries. For example, moving crude <b>oil</b> from <b>oil</b> wells in Nigeria to the refineries on the coast of the United States. Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets. For example, moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations.|$|E
50|$|Natural beard <b>oils</b> are {{typically}} created with both carrier <b>oils</b> and essential <b>oils,</b> absolutes, and/or extracts. Carrier <b>oils</b> are <b>oils</b> {{that make up}} the bulk of the volume of the product and are formulated to condition the skin and beard. The most popular types of carrier <b>oils</b> are coconut, grape seed, jojoba, saffron and argan. They are used as a natural fragrance for the beard <b>oils,</b> but also may have aromatherapy benefits. Since essential <b>oils,</b> absolutes, and extracts are usually very strong they may cause chemical burns or skin irritation, they are commonly paired up with carrier <b>oils</b> in order to dilute them.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ninety-one {{essential}} <b>oils,</b> each distilled from {{a single}} plant source, and 64 blended essential <b>oils</b> obtained from a commercial source were screened using the disc diffusion assay for inhibitory activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Of the 91 single essential <b>oils,</b> 78 exhibited zones of inhibition against MRSA, with lemongrass, lemon myrtle, mountain savory, cinnamon and melissa essential <b>oils</b> having {{the highest levels of}} inhibition. Of 64 blended essential <b>oils,</b> 52 exhibited inhibitory activity against MRSA, with R. C. (a combination of myrtle, Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus australiana, Eucalyptus radiata, marjoram, pine, cypress, lavender, spruce, peppermint and Eucalyptus citriodora <b>oils),</b> Motivation (a combination of Roman chamomile, ylang ylang, spruce and lavender <b>oils)</b> and Longevity (a combination of frankincense, clove, orange and thyme <b>oils)</b> blended essential <b>oils</b> having the highest inhibitory activity. These results indicate that essential <b>oils</b> alone and in combination can inhibit MRSA in vitro. Application of these results may include the potential use of essential <b>oils</b> as an alternative therapy for various diseases sustained by S. aureus MRSA...|$|R

40|$|Citrus peel {{essential}} <b>oils</b> {{are considered}} to constitute the most important resistance factor of citrus fruits against fruit flies. Essential <b>oils</b> were obtained from three sweet orange varieties, one bitter orange and one lemon variety. Yield, chemical composition and toxicity against neonates of the Mediterranean fruit fly were determined. Based on chemical analysis, the toxicity of commercially purchased major and minor components (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) of essential <b>oils</b> was determined. In addition, fractions were prepared to evaluate the role of minor components in the toxicity of crude essential <b>oils.</b> Limonene {{was by far the}} most abundant ingredient (96. 2 - 97. 4 %) in all sweet orange varieties and in bitter orange, while the concentration of limonene was much lower in lemon essential <b>oils</b> (74. 3 %). Orange and bitter orange essential <b>oils</b> were more toxic than lemon essential <b>oils.</b> The toxicity of orange and bitter orange essential <b>oils</b> was similar to that of their major component limonene. In tests of commercially purchased chemicals, the oxygenated components of essential <b>oils</b> were more toxic than hydrocarbons but their low concentration in citrus essential <b>oils</b> could not affect the toxic activity of essential <b>oils.</b> The presence of alpha-pinene and beta-pinene seems to account for the lower toxicity of lemon essential <b>oils</b> in relation to other citrus essential <b>oils.</b> The importance of understanding the toxicity of essential <b>oils</b> in relation to their composition and their role regarding the resistance of citrus fruits to Ceratitis capitata infestation is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} paper {{is to find out}} whether the {{addition}} of essential <b>oils</b> determines better oxidation stability and positive change of sensory and hedonic perception of edible <b>oils.</b> The oxidation stability of sunflower, corn and grape seed <b>oils</b> was analyzed in the presence of antioxidants in essential <b>oils</b> of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), thyme (Thymus vulgaris) and basil (Ocimum basilicum) during storage, under conditions of accelerated oxidative processes (4 days, at 60 °C). The total phenolic compounds of these essential <b>oils</b> were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The DPPH method was used to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of basil, rosemary and thyme essential <b>oils</b> in comparison with known synthetic antioxidant L(+) -ascorbic acid. The addition of essential <b>oils</b> to edible <b>oils,</b> the amounts proposed in analyses, determines a favorable influence on their oxidation stability as well as their taste. The influence of addition of essential <b>oils</b> on the taste of edible <b>oils</b> was studied in two products consumed mainly at breakfast, bread and spinach leaves. The results recommend the use of these plant extracts as additives in edible <b>oils</b> rather than synthetic antioxidants...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} {{literature}} concerning using vegetable <b>oils</b> {{as a replacement for}} diesel fuel. The term vegetable <b>oils</b> as used in this paper refers to vegetable <b>oils</b> which have not been modified by transesterification or similar processes to form what is called biodiesel. The <b>oils</b> studied include virgin and used <b>oils</b> of various types including soy, rapeseed, canola, sunflower, cottonseed and similar <b>oils.</b> In general, raw vegetable <b>oils</b> can be used successfully in short term performance tests in nearly any percentage as a replacement for diesel fuel. When tested in long term tests blends above 20 percent nearly always result in engine damage or maintenance problems. Some authors report success in using vegetable <b>oils</b> as diesel fuel extenders in blends less than 20 percent even in long term durability studies. Degumming is suggested by one author as a way to improve use of raw <b>oils</b> in low level blends. It is apparent that few, if any, engine studies using low-level blends of unmodified vegetable <b>oils,</b> < 20 %, have been conducted...|$|R

All essential <b>oils</b> inhibited the spores’ germination, but in varying degrees, in addition, presenting fungistatic activity. All the essential <b>oils</b> showed chemical instability when the incubation time or the interval between products application where increased, all <b>oils</b> decrease antifungal activity percentage.
