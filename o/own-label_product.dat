40|$|Purpose of the Paper	To {{explore the}} nature and scope of good and bad {{practice}} in the relationships that UK supermarkets have with their suppliers of <b>own-label</b> <b>products</b> in the main commodity sectors (meat, dairy, fresh produce) Design/Methodology/Approach	The paper {{presents the results of}} a postal survey of supermarket suppliers, which formed part of a wider study of corporate social responsibility in UK supermarket supply chains Findings	The results demonstrate the heterogeneity in relationships between supermarkets and their suppliers of <b>own-label</b> <b>products</b> in the main commodity sectors the extent to which retail and supply chain strategy is likely to influence the way in which supermarkets deal with suppliers. Best practice was most evident in the two supermarket supply chains where supply base rationalisation has virtually ceased and the adoption of lead suppliers and sole suppliers has been most evident in recent years. Research Limitations/Implications	Postal survey limited to suppliers in three commodity sectors, where buyer power is greatest. Would expect different results for relationships with branded suppliers. Practical Implications	With supermarkets coming under increasing scrutiny over the way they treat suppliers, the conceptual framework and survey instrument represent an mechanism for independent assessment of supply chain relationships in sensitive markets, which could be used constructively to encourage the more widespread adoption of good practice and the elimination of bad practice in supermarket relationships. What is Original/Value of Paper	This paper presents the results of the first attempt anywhere to empirically measure fairness in relationships between supermarkets and their suppliers. Further research is necessary but the results of our early work are extremely encouraging. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} role of sales as a feature of price {{dynamics}} using scanner data. The study analyses a unique, high frequency panel of supermarket prices consisting of over 230, 000 weekly price observations on around 500 products in 15 categories of food stocked by the UK’s seven largest retail chains. In all, 1, 700 weekly time series {{are available at the}} barcode-specific level including branded and <b>own-label</b> <b>products.</b> The data allows the frequency, magnitude and duration of sales to be analysed in greater detail than has hitherto been possible with UK data. The main results are: (i) sales are a key feature of aggregate price variation with around 40 per cent of price variation being accounted for by sales once price differences for each UPC level across the major retailers are accounted for; (ii) much of the price variation that is observed in the UK food retailing sector is accounted for by price differences between retailers; (iii) only a small proportion of price variation that is observed in UK food retailing is common across the major retailers suggesting that cost shocks originating at the manufacturing level {{is not one of the}} main sources of price variation in the UK; (iv) <b>own-label</b> <b>products</b> also exhibit considerable sales behaviour though this is less important than sales for branded goods; and (v) there is some evidence of coordination in the timing of sales across retailers insofar as the probability of a sale at the UPC level at a given retailer increases if the product is also on sale at another retailer.

40|$|International audienceEach year, {{hundreds}} of <b>own-label</b> <b>products</b> {{appear on the}} shelves of major multiple retailers that "look" like successful brands. The close imitation of a national brand trade dress aims at creating a "halo of resemblance," {{on the basis of}} which consumers may make inferences and attributions of similarity of use, of content, if not of origin. In most countries, imitation is condemned if there is a risk of confusion. But the final decision {{as to whether or not}} such a risk exists is left up to the judge. The purpose of this paper is to test for the presence of confusion by means of a tachistoscopic experiment. It aims at bringing empirical data into the courtroom. Hence, it relies on the operational definition used by courts to evaluate the likelihood of confusion. This research demonstrates that the risk of confusion is real. It also shows how this confusion operates. Finally, it raises some important ethical issues in the face of the fact that many copied brands hesitate to engage lawsuits...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{argues for}} the need to build an {{economic}} sociology/political economy of demand that goes from micro-individual through to macro-structural features. It develops an ?instituted economic process? approach {{to the study of}} demand and innovation to account for processes of institutionalisation and deinstitutionalisation. Within this framework, the concept of a ?production?distribution?retail?consumption? configuration is seen as shaping innovation. The empirical investigations of this chapter involve analysis of how retail markets link demand with supply, and how that link is a structured one: the interface facing both ways. The chapter explores three empirical cases. The first involves the near disappearance of wholesale markets for fresh fruit and vegetables to retail markets, and the particular questions raised in terms of range and quality of products that flow through them. The second deals with an equally significant reconfiguration of the retail?distribution?production configuration reflected in the emergence of supermarket <b>own-label</b> <b>products.</b> The third raises the question of how the organisation of retail markets, and their transformation, alters the way demand is instituted between end consumers and retailers...|$|R

Nonparametrically identified non-nested tests identify the most likely pricing game for the Boston white fluid milk market. Results from this analysis indicate that branded milk manufacturers are Stackelberg leaders to retailers and store brand milks are procured at or near cost. This baseline model of the market is matched against a series of counterfactual markets to assess {{the impact of}} strong store brands. One counterfactual simulation considers the absence of the leading retailer’s own labeled milk. Another considers the market without store brand milks. Simulation results indicate that strong store brands increase channel profits, retailer profits, and consumer welfare, while having mixed ef-We thank Alessandro Bonanno, Jean-Pierre Dubé, Avi Goldfarb, Sylvie Tchumtchoua, and Gautam Tripathi for valuable discussions and comments leading to improvements in this paper.

At the production stage, Waitrose <b>own-label</b> <b>products</b> are fully traceable, GM-free and all suppliers undergo a detailed assessment programme based on current best practice. Crop suppliers to Waitrose operate an authenticity programme to certify that each assignment is GM-free and produce is screened for pesticide residues. Waitrose sources conventional crops grown from 'Integrated Crop Management Systems' (ICMS) using best horticultural practices. The 'Assured Product' scheme regulates all UK produce to ICMS standards and these audits are being extended worldwide. Business is withdrawn from suppliers who fail the audit. In relation to this, Waitrose has increased its Fairtrade range as in its view 'Buying these products provides direct additional benefit to workers in the developing countries where they are produced and assists marginal producers by giving them access to markets they would not otherwise have'. Currently, Waitrose is developing its own sustainable timber assessment criteria. For livestock, protocols are in place to ensure that animals are reared under the 'most natural conditions possible' and free range produce is offered where animals have access to open space although some produce is not from free-range animals. Waitrose also use a 'Hazards Analysis Critical Points' system to identify food safety hazards that occur at any stage from production to point of sale and to ensure that full measures are in place to control them. In addition, mechanisms have been implemented to reduce fuel use and hence reduce CO 2 emissions in the transport of products and staff, and to increase the energy use efficiency of refrigeration systems which account for approximately 60...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{sought to}} understand ways to change consumer food purchasing behaviour {{to become more}} environmentally sustainable. The literature review pointed to the influential yet understudied role of situational factors within the purchase decision making process, {{and the potential for}} labelling as a strategy for behaviour change. The launch of a carbon labelling trial of <b>own-label</b> <b>products</b> by the UK’s largest supermarket represented an opportunity to investigate and measure the potential role of carbon labelling in facilitating behaviour change. The research utilises an innovative mixed method case study approach. The first phase of the case study was exploratory focus groups, designed to provide an understanding of the reasons behind current food shopping habits and patterns and to gain an appreciation of current levels of awareness, understanding and use of carbon labelling. Results paved the way for phase two of the case study, a series of interventions both pre-store (working with schools) and in-store (various activities) designed to raise awareness and understanding of carbon labelling sufficiently to overcome unfavourable situational factors and convert into favourable situational factors, and create a more conducive environment to enable purchasing of a carbon labelled product. Results of the interventions were evaluated using several sources of evidence – teacher’s interviews, two questionnaires and, most significantly, using actual purchasing behaviour data through the use of supermarket loyalty card data. Results showed some impact on raising awareness, understanding and claimed behaviour, but no discernible impact on actual purchasing behaviour. This research highlights the importance of situational factors in the purchase decision making process, and the challenges associated with changing behaviour in the face of competing and often conflicting drivers of supermarket purchasing behaviour. It also highlights the benefits of mixed methods in understanding behaviour and evaluating impacts of targeted interventions, particularly in such complex contexts as sustainability, consumption and the supermarket shopping mission.

40|$|The growing use {{of private}} labels {{in recent years}} has {{affected}} significantly the landscape of retail competition, with major retailers no longer being confined to their traditional role as purchasers and distributors of branded goods. By selling their <b>own-label</b> <b>products</b> within their outlets they are competing with their upstream brand suppliers for sales and shelf space. This unique relationship, and the continued strengthening of private labels, raises important questions as to their pro-competitive effects and possible negative effects. This book provides an in-depth review of the range of competitive and intellectual property issues raised in connection with private brands in Europe and the US. It examines the development of private labels and their impact on retail competition, then moves on to focus on policy and question the adequacy of current economic and legal analysis in light of the characteristics of own-label competition, and finally it presents a thorough evaluation of the legal issues in the field, including chapters on horizontal and vertical effects, dominance, mergers and acquisitions, intellectual property, copycat packaging and consumer welfare. The book contains a collection of essays reflecting the debate on the impact of private labels upon competition, investment and innovation in the retail sector. The ideas and arguments underlying the articles have been developed through a series of seminars held in the Oxford Centre for Competition Law and Policy over the last three years. Participants in these seminars have included competition officials, law academics, practitioners and representatives from industry.
