25|$|In {{any part}} of the world that uses <b>organophosphates,</b> C. megacephala could prove to be beneficial. Organophosphate {{compounds}} are used in agriculture and are highly toxic. Organophosphate poisoning often causes death, and in many cases, by evaluating the body tissue and fluids, the toxin can be identified as the source of the poisoning. However, it is somewhat difficult to evaluate the body tissue in a body that is exceedingly decomposed. Nevertheless, a medical examiner in Hawaii worked on a case in which poisoning by malathion, an organophosphate insecticide, was thought to be the cause of death. The victim’s stomach contents and body fat were examined and found to have contained malathion. The fly larvae of Chrysomya megacephala and Chrysomya rufifacies were also present at the scene on the body and were tested for malathion. Both of these species did contain malathion, but there had been no previous record of <b>organophosphates</b> in their larvae. Studying larvae from decomposed remains may provide an effective method of determining the presence of these toxins in a body that is extremely decayed.|$|E
40|$|Background: Farmers in {{developing}} countries use highly toxic <b>organophosphate</b> pesticides.

25|$|Many {{pesticides}} can {{be grouped}} into chemical families. Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines, <b>organophosphates,</b> and carbamates. Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g., DDT) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, {{and other related}} compounds. They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their toxicities vary greatly, {{but they have been}} phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate. Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines. Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. <b>Organophosphates</b> are quite toxic to vertebrates and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates. Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates. Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g. 2,4-D), triazines (e.g., atrazine), ureas (e.g., diuron), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g., alachlor). Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses. The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plant's nutrient transport system. Triazines interfere with photosynthesis. Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including glyphosate.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{and chronic}} {{pollution}} events {{have been shown}} to impact southern California kelp forests, though the intensity of the impact seems to depend on both the nature of the contaminants and duration of exposure. Pollution can include sediment deposition and eutrophication from sewage, industrial byproducts and contaminants like PCBs and heavy metals (for example, copper, zinc), runoff of <b>organophosphates</b> from agricultural areas, anti-fouling chemicals used in harbors and marinas (for example, TBT and creosote) and land-based pathogens like fecal coliform bacteria.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to address this complication, neurite outgrowths (either axonal or dendritic) in {{response}} to applied compounds have recently been proposed as a more accurate distinction between true neurotoxins and cytotoxins in an in-vitro testing environment. Due to the significant inaccuracies associated with this process, however, it has been slow in gaining widespread support. Additionally, biochemical mechanisms have become more widely used in neurotoxin testing, such that compounds can be screened for sufficiency to induce cell mechanism interference, like the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase capacity of <b>organophosphates</b> (includes DDT and sarin gas). Though methods of determining neurotoxicity still require significant development, the identification of deleterious compounds and toxin exposure symptoms has undergone significant improvement.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—Poisoning by <b>organophosphate</b> {{insecticides}} causes cholinergic toxicity. <b>Organophosphate</b> induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) is a sensory-motor {{distal axonopathy}} which usually occurs after ingestion of large doses of certain <b>organophosphate</b> insecticides and {{has so far}} only been reported in patients with preceding cholinergic toxicity. Surprisingly, it was recently reported by other authors that an exclusively sensory neuropathy developed in eight patients after repeated unquantified exposures to chlorpyrifos, which did not cause clear-cut cholinergic toxicity. The objective was to assess whether an exclusively sensory neuropathy develops in patients severely poisoned by various OPs.  METHODS—Toxicological studies and electrophysiological measurements were performed in peripheral motor and sensory nerves in 11 patients after acute <b>organophosphate</b> poisoning among which two subjects were poisoned with chlorpyrifos.  RESULTS—Three patients developed OPIDP, including one poisoned by chlorpyrifos. Exclusively sensory neuropathy was never seen after either single or repeated acute <b>organophosphate</b> poisoning. A mild sensory component {{was associated with a}} severe motor component in two of the three cases of OPIDP, the other was an exclusively motor polyneuropathy.  CONCLUSION—A sensory-motor polyneuropathy caused by <b>organophosphate</b> insecticides might occur after a severe poisoning and the sensory component, if present, is milder than the motor one. Bearing in mind the toxicological characteristics of these <b>organophosphate</b> insecticides, other causes should be sought for sensory peripheral neuropathies in patients who did not display severe cholinergic toxicity {{a few weeks before the}} onset of symptoms and signs. ...|$|R

25|$|Insecticides {{have also}} been used often in prevention, but with {{improper}} application and heavy reliance throughout the years, insecticide resistance and residues within the wool have caused much concern. The primary reason for failures in using insecticides is attributed to poor application. Jetting, dipping, and backlining are the three most commonly used methods for insecticide application, {{and most of the}} chemicals used belong to three types of chemicals: synthetic pyrethroids, <b>organophosphates,</b> insect growth regulators and spinosins. Insect growth regulators can provide the long term protection against flies and when applied correctly provide protection during the susceptible times of the year. Resistance to this group of insecticide has been identified. Spinosins are good for short term control of flies and leave no residues in wool. Many government agencies mandate that the wool be free of insecticidal residues forcing withholding periods by farmers before shearing. During this time, the flock can become extremely sensitive to flystrike.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the level}} of damage an {{infestation}} can result in, much has been done over the years in the effort to manage, reduce, and eliminate the horn fly. Traditional methods were through the use of pour-ons, backrubbers and face powder bags, with products such as Co-Ral which is available as dust for face/horn flies. Self-applicator methods such as dust bags and backrubbers are used mainly for range or pasture herds, and are placed so that the animal cannot avoid coming into contact with it, such as at a gate through which animals pass. More recently, control of the horn fly by using ear tags on cattle has been extremely successful. The ear tags are made of a PVC matrix impregnated with pyrethroid, and can be effective for between 16 and 24 weeks. Originally, the ear tags were developed and used against such pests as ticks and by 1983 50% of cattle had ear tags. Long periods of such dosing resulted in the elimination of 95-99% of susceptible flies, but this strong selective pressure ended up resulting in the development of resistant strains of the flies. To combat this, the use of <b>organophosphates</b> and piperonyl butoxide as a synergist are now recommended to be alternated with pyrethroid to help slow resistance. In addition, methoprene in the form of sustained release bolus (a rounded mass of food or pharmaceutical preparation ready to swallow) inhibits the emergence of an adult insect from a pupal case or an insect larva from an egg for up to 7 months.|$|E
