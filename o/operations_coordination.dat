It was key part of UNDG's formation in 1997, uniting the UN system and {{improve the quality of}} its development assistance. Coordination leads to more strategic UN support for national plans and priorities, makes operations more efficient, reduces transaction costs for governments, and ultimately helps people attain the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development objectives. At present [...] is the Secretariat and technical and advisory support unit of the UNDG. It brings together the UN development system to promote change and innovation to deliver together on sustainable development. DOCO works under the leadership of the UNDG Chair and guidance of the UNDG. The team provides field evidence to inform policy, facilitates the achievement of shared results, and promotes excellence in UN leadership and coordination. The core objective is a relevant and impactful UN contribution to development.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDrawing {{lessons from}} the constructions of {{domestic}} and foreign urban rail transit network <b>operation</b> <b>coordination</b> platform, the paper puts forward the structure of network command center information platform with the full life cycle management idea and the open architecture. Besides, it designs the main platform functions and explores key technologies such as the information fusion mechanism, real-time monitoring with GIS technology, equipment alarm monitoring and intelligent emergency decision. The network command center integrated information platform which has important functions in the <b>operation</b> <b>coordination,</b> resource sharing, and emergency decision is the main technical support system of urban rail transit network operation and management. It can grasp the real-time operation situation of each rail transit line, use for the daily operation supervision,and especially unify coordination control during emergencies to implement emergency linkage by organizing relevant departments and assembling the rescue resources. The running effect of the network command center information platform suggests that the system can effectively improve the urban rail major accident or emergency rapid response capability and scientific decision so as {{to ensure the safety}} of urban transportation...|$|R
5000|$|The {{primary focus}} of this article is {{asynchronous}} control in digital electronic systems. [...] In a synchronous system, operations (instructions, calculations, logic, etc.) are coordinated by one, or more, centralized clock signals. An asynchronous digital system, in contrast, has no global clock. Asynchronous systems do not depend on strict arrival times of signals or messages for reliable <b>operation.</b> <b>Coordination</b> is achieved via events such as: packet arrival, changes (transitions) of signals, handshake protocols, and other methods.|$|R
50|$|Ports must {{smoothly}} coordinate ships reaching port, {{departing from}} port {{as well as}} the loading and discharging of ships in relation to inbound and outbound transportation. This means that sea voyages must be in synchronization with port operations such that ship arrivals can be accurately predicted and prepared for. In STM the ambition is to enable this level of <b>operation</b> <b>coordination</b> by improving situational awareness through information sharing. The information needed may be included in the standardized route exchange protocol developed.|$|R
