5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} {{poisoning}} include carbon monoxide detectors, proper venting of gas appliances, keeping chimneys clean, and keeping exhaust systems of vehicles in good repair. Treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving 100% oxygen along with supportive care. This should generally {{be carried out}} until symptoms are no longer present and the HbCO level is less than 10%. While hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> is unclear. The risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30%.|$|E
5|$|A letter Hess {{wrote to}} his wife dated 4 November 1940 shows {{that in spite of}} not {{receiving}} a reply from Hamilton, he intended to proceed with his plan. He began training on the Messerschmitt Bf 110, a two-seater twin-engine aircraft, in October 1940 under instructor Wilhelm Stör, the chief test pilot at Messerschmitt. He continued to practice, including logging many cross-country flights, and found a specific aircraft that handled well—a Bf 110E-1/N—which was from then on held in reserve for his personal use. He asked for a radio compass, modifications to the <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> system, and large long-range fuel tanks to be installed on this plane, and these requests were granted by March 1941.|$|E
5|$|Operational {{problems}} have been experienced and some have caused fleet-wide groundings. Critically, pilots have experienced a decreased mental status, including losing consciousness. There were reports of instances of pilots {{found to have a}} decreased level of alertness or memory loss after landing. F-22 pilots have experienced lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough; other symptoms include irritability, emotional lability and neurological changes. A number of possible causes were investigated, including possible exposure to noxious chemical agents from the respiratory tubing, pressure suit malfunction, side effects from <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> at greater-than-atmospheric concentrations, and oxygen supply disruptions. Other problems include minor mechanical problems and navigational software failures. The fleet was grounded for four months in 2011 before resuming flight, but reports of oxygen issues persisted.|$|E

25|$|In crude terms, this {{measurement}} compares {{left and}} right cardiac activity and calculates preload and afterload flow and pressures which, theoretically, can be stabilized or adjusted with drugs to either constrict or dilate the vessels (to raise or lower, respectively, the pressure of blood flowing to the lungs), {{in order to maximize}} <b>oxygen</b> for <b>delivery</b> to the body tissues.|$|R
30|$|Conclusion: The {{addition}} of a Dup-Reyg system to the expiratory way of a BS increases FiO 2 significantly. This system could be implemented {{for the purpose of}} increasing the FiO 2 when the IF is high and or when the <b>oxygen</b> flow <b>delivery</b> is limited (ambulance, disaster situations, war zone etc.). However, complementary studies must be carried out in order to verify its clinical application.|$|R
5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> to all tissues, but also leads {{to the production of}} methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E
25|$|An over-tight {{neck seal}} can put {{pressure}} on the carotid artery, causing a reflex which slows the heart, resulting in poor <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> to the brain, light-headedness and eventual unconsciousness. For this reason, neck seals should be stretched or trimmed to the correct size.|$|E
25|$|More recent {{research}} has examined <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> in trauma patients, looking at biomarkers and physiological parameters such as organ-specific pH monitoring. Other studies have challenged the utilization of accepted predictive markers such as vital signs, and serum lactic acid levels, in trying to employ the use of end-tidal carbon dioxide as a better diagnostic and prognostic marker in penetrating trauma patients.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{exhibit a}} wide range of tactics to {{counteract}} aquatic hypoxia, but when escape from the hypoxic stress is not possible, maintaining <b>oxygen</b> extraction and <b>delivery</b> becomes an essential component to survival. Except for the Antarctic ice fish that does not, most fish use hemoglobin (Hb) within their red blood cells to bind chemically and deliver 95% of the oxygen extracted from the environment to the working tissues. Maintaining <b>oxygen</b> extraction and <b>delivery</b> to the tissues allows continued activity under hypoxic stress and is in part determined by modifications in two different blood parameters: hematocrit and the binding properties of hemoglobin.|$|R

When quoted as an acronym, coronary artery disease becumes an insulting CAD, secondary carcinoma of the upper mediastinum turns into SCUM, thyroid uptake gradient transforms into THUG, and right atrial pressure elevation transmutes into RAPE.

25|$|Except in {{the most}} severe cases, ischemic colitis is treated with {{supportive}} care. IV fluids are given to treat dehydration, and the patient is placed on bowel rest (meaning nothing to eat or drink) until the symptoms resolve. If possible, cardiac function and oxygenation should be optimized to improve <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> to the ischemic bowel. A nasogastric tube may be inserted if an ileus is present.|$|E
25|$|There are devices which {{test the}} {{sufficiency}} of <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> to the colon. The first device {{approved by the}} U.S. FDA in 2004 uses visible light spectroscopy to analyze capillary oxygen levels. Use during Aortic Aneurysm repair detected when colon oxygen levels fell below sustainable levels, allowing real-time repair. In several studies, Specificity has been 90% or higher for acute colonic ischemia, and 83% for chronic mesenteric ischemia, with a sensitivity of 71%-92%. This device must be placed using endoscopy, however.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin {{also carries}} nitric oxide (NO) in the globin {{part of the}} molecule. This {{improves}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> in the periphery and contributes to the control of respiration. NO binds reversibly to a specific cysteine residue in globin; the binding depends on the state (R or T) of the hemoglobin. The resulting S-nitrosylated hemoglobin influences various NO-related activities such as the control of vascular resistance, blood pressure and respiration. NO is not released in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes but transported by an anion exchanger called AE1 out of them.|$|E
30|$|Severe {{acidosis}} in sepsis {{is associated}} with haemodynamic instability through many different pathophysiologic mechanisms (reduced left ventricular contractility, diastolic dysfunction and right ventricular failure, predisposition to cardiac arrhythmias, arterial vasodilation, impaired responsiveness to catecholamines, reduced hepatic blood flow, impaired <b>oxygen</b> tissue <b>delivery)</b> [27]. Kellum et al. [28] demonstrated that hyperchloraemic acidosis reduced the mean arterial pressure (MAP) in normotensive septic rats; the decrease in MAP showed a higher correlation to plasma Cl− elevation as compared to pH reduction. Moderate acidosis enhanced plasma nitrite levels, a result confirming previous studies by Pedoto et al. [24] who reported an increase in serum nitrite levels and {{a significant decrease in}} blood pressure in healthy rats after HCl-induced acidosis.|$|R
50|$|Physical exercise, {{particularly}} continuous aerobic exercises such as running, cycling and swimming, {{has many}} cognitive benefits and {{effects on the}} brain. Influences on the brain include increases in neurotransmitter levels, improved <b>oxygen</b> and nutrient <b>delivery,</b> and increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus.

We are also making too many errors, but at least there is a new nitric oxide therapy in the offing. How to deliver <b>oxygen?</b> The <b>delivery</b> of <b>oxygen</b> to tissues remains a central tenet of intensive care medicine. Much of the attention has focused on optimizing cardiac output and perfusion pressure, not least because we possess therapeutic tools that affect these parameters. The second element in the equation is oxygen carrying capacity, which is primarily determined by haemoglobin concentration and hence red cell mass. Transfusion of stored red blood cells is used to maintain oxygen carrying capacity, although the optimal use of this therapy remains a...|$|R
25|$|Supraglottic airway — a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any {{airway device}} that is seated above {{and outside the}} trachea, as an {{alternative}} to endotracheal intubation. Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery.</b> Newer devices feature esophageal ports for suctioning or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia. There are many types of SGAs available including the Esophageal-tracheal Combitube (ETC), Laryngeal tube (LT), and the obsolete Esophageal obturator airway (EOA).|$|E
25|$|Angiogenesis is {{generally}} associated with aerobic exercise and endurance exercise. While arteriogenesis produces network changes {{that allow for}} a large increase {{in the amount of}} total flow in a network, angiogenesis causes changes that allow for greater nutrient delivery {{over a long period of}} time. Capillaries are designed to provide maximum nutrient delivery efficiency, so an increase in the number of capillaries allows the network to deliver more nutrients in the same amount of time. A greater number of capillaries also allows for greater oxygen exchange in the network. This is vitally important to endurance training, because it allows a person to continue training for an extended period of time. However, no experimental evidence suggests that increased capillarity is required in endurance exercise to increase the maximum <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{woolly mammoth}} was {{probably}} the most specialised member of the family Elephantidae. They had lipopexia (fat storage) in their neck and withers, for times when food availability was insufficient during winter, and their first three molars grew more quickly than in the calves of modern elephants. The expansion identified on the trunk of [...] "Yuka" [...] and other specimens was suggested to function as a [...] "fur mitten"; the trunk tip was not covered in fur, but was used for foraging during winter, and could have been heated by curling it into the expansion. It was also suggested that the expansion could be used to melt snow if there was shortage of water to drink, as melting it directly inside the mouth could disturb the thermal balance of the animal. As in reindeer and musk oxen, the haemoglobin of the woolly mammoth was adapted to the cold, with three mutations to improve <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> around the body and prevent freezing. This feature may have helped the mammoths to live in high latitudes.|$|E

50|$|Vascular theory: Postulates that {{increases}} in capillary pressure, constriction of veins, and shunting of blood through anastomoses {{to bypass the}} capillaries, causes decreased blood and therefore decreased <b>oxygen</b> and nutrient <b>delivery</b> to lamellae. The end-result would be ischemia, leading to cellular death and breakdown between the lamellae. Subsequently, increased vascular permeability leads to edema within the hoof, compression of small vessels, and ischemia. Vasoactive amines may be partially to blame for changes in hoof blood flow.|$|R
40|$|Seventeen {{patients}} with hemodynamic instability from acute cerebrovascular accidents were evaluated shortly after {{arrival at the}} emergency department of a university-run county hospital with both invasive Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter placement and a new, noninvasive, thoracic electrical bioimpedance device. Values were recorded and temporal patterns of survivors and nonsurvivors were described. Cardiac indices obtained simultaneously by the 2 techniques were compared. Of the 17 patients, 11 (65 %) died. Survivors had higher values than nonsurvivors for mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, and <b>oxygen</b> saturation, <b>delivery,</b> and consumption at comparable times. Cardiac index values, as measured by invasive and noninvasive methods, were correlated. We concluded that hemodynamic monitoring in an acute care setting may recognize temporal circulatory patterns associated with outcome. Noninvasive electrical bioimpedance technology offers a new method for early hemodynamic evaluation. Further {{research in this area}} is warranted...|$|R
2500|$|The main {{difficulty}} {{in the in}} vivo study of embryonic vascular remodelling has been to separate the effects of physical cues from the delivery of nutrients, oxygen, and other signalling factors which may {{have an effect on}} vascular remodelling. [...] Previous work has involved control of blood viscosity in early cardiovascular flow, such as preventing the entry of red blood cells into blood plasma, thereby lowering viscosity and associated shear stresses. Starch can also be injected into the blood stream in order to increase viscosity and shear stress. Studies have shown that vascular remodelling in the embryo proceeds without the presence of erythrocytes, which are responsible for <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery.</b> Therefore, vascular remodelling does not depend on the presence of oxygen and in fact occurs before perfused tissues require <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery.</b> [...] However, it is still unknown whether or not other nutrients or genetic factors may have promotional effects on vascular remodelling.|$|E
2500|$|Clinical {{trials have}} shown the {{benefits}} of coronary stenting with bare-metal stents over other methods of angioplasty, including balloon angioplasty and atherectomy. [...] Drug-eluting stents (DES) have also been extensively studied, and are generally superior to bare-metal stents with respect to occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE, generally defined as death, myocardial infarction, or {{the need for a}} repeat revascularization procedure). Stents are indicated to improve the diameter of the coronary artery lumen, when narrowing (generally because of atherosclerosis) causes ischemia (reduced <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> to the muscle supplied by that artery).|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{catheters}} {{have multiple}} lumina — {{five or six}} are common — and have openings along the [...] length to allow administration of inotropes and other drugs directly into the [...] atrium. [...] Drugs to achieve these changes can be delivered into the atrium via the fourth lumen, usually dedicated to medication. Common drugs used are various inotropes, norepinephrine or even atropine. A further set of calculations {{can be made by}} measuring the arterial blood and central venous (from the third lumen) and inputting these figures into a spreadsheet or the cardiac output computer, if so equipped, and plotting an <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> profile.|$|E
40|$|Retinopathy of prematurity(ROP) is an {{ocular disease}} caused by retinal {{ophthalmic}} dysplasia in premature infants, leads to strabismus, amblyopia, cataract, glaucoma, and even blindness, which seriously affects {{the quality of}} life of preterm infants. The infant blindness ratio has climbed to 6 %- 18 %, according to figures released by the World Health Organisation. ROP is the primary cause of blindness in children of the world in recent years. But the pathogenesis of ROP is not yet clear. Gestational age, birth weight, <b>oxygen</b> intake, <b>delivery</b> mode, multiple newborns, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, anemia, blood transfusion, sepsis, infection, hypercapnia, hyperbilirubinemia, maternal prenatal use of a drug are all the risk factors.

50|$|As time elapses {{after the}} onset of stroke, {{the extent of the}} {{penumbra}} tends to decrease; therefore, in the emergency department a major concern is to protect the penumbra by increasing <b>oxygen</b> transport and <b>delivery</b> to cells in the danger zone, thereby limiting cell death. The existence of a penumbra implies that salvage of the cells is possible. There is a high correlation between the extent of spontaneous neurological recovery and the volume of penumbra that escapes infarction; therefore, saving the penumbra should improve the clinical outcome.|$|R
2500|$|Diving mammals have {{an elastic}} aortic bulb thought to help {{maintain}} arterial pressure during the extended intervals between heartbeats during dives, and have high blood volume, combined with large storage capacity in veins and retes of the thorax and head in seals and dolphins. Chronic physiological adaptations of blood include elevated hematocrit, hemoglobin, and myoglobin levels which enable greater <b>oxygen</b> storage and <b>delivery</b> to essential organs during a dive.

The most common option (but not approved by FDA) some patients choose is to acquire an oxygen concentrator which typically delivers 85–96% oxygen as the breathing gas.|$|E
2500|$|Presentation {{is similar}} {{to other forms of}} rapid heart rate and may be asymptomatic. Palpitations and chest {{discomfort}} are common complaints. The rapid uncoordinated heart rate may result in reduced cardiac output, with the heart being unable to provide adequate blood flow and therefore <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> {{to the rest of the}} body. Common symptoms of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation may include shortness of breath, shortness of breath when lying flat, dizziness, [...] and sudden onset of shortness of breath during the night. This may progress to swelling of the lower extremities, a manifestation of congestive heart failure. Due to inadequate cardiac output, individuals with AF may also complain of light-headedness, may feel like they are about to faint, or may actually lose consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|A {{feature of}} the {{pulmonary}} artery catheter that has been largely ignored in the clinical setting {{is its ability to}} monitor total body oxygen extraction by measuring the mixed venous oxygen saturation. [...] Regardless of the value obtained by measurements of the cardiac output, the mixed venous oxygen saturation is an accurate parameter of total body blood flow and therefore cardiac output. The assumption that a low mixed venous oxygen saturation (normal = 60% except for the coronary sinus where it approximates 40% reflecting the high metabolic rate of the myocardium) represents less than adequate <b>oxygen</b> <b>delivery</b> is consistent with physiological and metabolic observations. High oxygen extraction is associated with low cardiac output and decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation. Except during hypothermia and in severe sepsis, low mixed venous oxygen saturations are indication of inadequate hemodynamics. The ability of the pulmonary artery catheter to sample mixed venous blood is of great utility to manage low cardiac output states.|$|E

The assessment and grading of diastolic dysfunction remains challenging in these patients, and the guidelines used in the outpatient setting are not fully applicable. While pharmacological optimization remains difficult, especially with time constraints (urgency/emergency cases), a proactive management aiming at maintaining adequate loading conditions and an appropriate balance between myocardial <b>oxygen</b> demand and <b>delivery</b> {{could be the best}} strategies in managing patients with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.|$|R
