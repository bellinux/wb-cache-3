5|$|Stratton {{was exposed}} to {{multiple}} influences through his life. As an undergraduate student of Howison, he learned about philosophy and religion. At Yale and later at Wundt's lab, he switched to experimental psychology and studied perception, memory and emotion. His exposure to World War I, serving in the Army then, focused his mind on issues <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>and</b> <b>peace</b> and international relations. Stratton's later work reflected these elements of his experience. He was also a scholar of the classics and translated some Greek philosophers.|$|E

5|$|Prokofiev {{had been}} {{considering}} making an opera out of Leo Tolstoy's epic novel War and Peace, when {{news of the}} German invasion of Russia on 22June 1941 made the subject seem all the more timely. Prokofiev took two years to compose his original version <b>of</b> <b>War</b> <b>and</b> <b>Peace.</b> Because of the war he was evacuated together {{with a large number}} of other artists, initially to the Caucasus where he composed his Second String Quartet. By now, his relationship with the 25-year-old writer and librettist Mira Mendelson (1915–1968) had finally led to his separation from his wife Lina, although they never divorced: indeed Prokofiev had tried to persuade Lina and their sons to accompany him as evacuees out of Moscow, but Lina opted to stay.|$|E

Extra sessions can be called by the President of the Republic, {{by the president of}} the parliament or by the government. The powers of the legislature include enactment and amendment of the constitution, enactment of laws, adoption of the state budget, declarations <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>and</b> <b>peace,</b> alteration of the country's boundaries, calling and conducting referenda and elections, appointments and relief of office, supervising the work of the Government of Croatia and other holders of public powers responsible to the Sabor, and granting amnesty.

5|$|The royal {{prerogative}} is in much {{use in the}} realm of foreign affairs. It is the monarch who recognises foreign states (although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives), issues declarations <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>and</b> <b>peace,</b> and forms international treaties. The monarch also has the power to annexe territory, as was done in 1955 with the island of Rockall. Once territory has been annexed, the monarch has complete discretion as {{to the extent to which}} the government will take over the former government's liabilities; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v The King. The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory. Her freedom to do these things in practice is doubtful, in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights. When the island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany in 1890, Parliamentary approval was first sought. The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council. The courts have long fought against the monarch's use of this power: in R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2), the Court of Appeal ruled that using Orders-in-Council to frustrate judicial rulings was an unlawful abuse of power, although this ruling was later overturned.|$|E

However, with continuing losses in the war he was forced to make peace in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia, concluding the war.
