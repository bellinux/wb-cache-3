50|$|The {{regional}} accrediting {{agencies were}} established in the late 19th and early 20th centuries {{in response to a}} perceived need for better articulation between secondary schools and higher education institutions (the school offered the courses the college needed applicants to have taken; this helped colleges and universities evaluate prospective students). The New England Association was formed in 1885 by a group of schoolmasters of secondary schools. The Middle States Association formed in 1887. The faculty of Vanderbilt University led the establishment of the Southern Association in 1895, and the North Central Association was <b>organized</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> year at a meeting of 36 administrators of midwestern schools, colleges, and universities. The Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools (predecessor of the two organizations that now serve that region) was formed in 1917 and the Western Association was founded in 1923. Initially the main focus of the organizations was on accreditation of secondary schools and establishment of uniform college entrance requirements.|$|E
50|$|When Longboat was a child, a Mohawk {{resident}} of the reserve, Bill Davis, who in 1901 {{finished second in the}} Boston Marathon, interested him in running races. He began racing in 1905, finishing second in the Victoria Day race at Caledonia, Ontario. His first important victory was in the Around the Bay Road Race in Hamilton, Ontario in 1906, which he won by three minutes. In 1907 he won the Boston Marathon in a record time of 2:24:24 over the old 24-1/2 mile course, four minutes and 59 seconds faster than any of the previous ten winners of the event. He collapsed, however, in the 1908 Olympic marathon, along with several other leading runners, and a rematch was <b>organized</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> year at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Longboat won this race, turned professional, and in 1909 at the same venue won the title of Professional Champion of the World in another marathon.|$|E

5000|$|In the Mirror World case, {{the patent}} claimed a method and {{apparatus}} for organizing [...] "data units" [...] (i.e., documents) into [...] "streams" [...] and [...] "substreams." [...] This {{was said to}} organize, locate, summarize, and monitor incoming data. Apple argued that this just meant that data was being organized, say, in chronological order—and that was just an abstract idea. Apple said {{this was not a}} computer problem, particularly, and paper documents could be <b>organized</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way. Anyway, the operation could be performed conventionally on a conventional computer. In response, Mirror World argued that streams and substreams were computer concepts not found in the pre-computer world of paper documents. This argument impressed the PTO. The PTO considered that the streams and substreams were manipulated by a computer electronically in a way that did not duplicate prior art paper shuffling, and that improved computer functionality as in Enfish. Therefore, the claims were patent eligible.|$|E
5000|$|Kunihiko Iwadare and Takeshiro Maeda {{established}} Nippon Electric Limited Partnership on August 31, 1898 {{by using}} facilities {{that they had}} bought from Miyoshi Electrical Manufacturing Company.

[...] Carleton was also responsible for the renovation of the Miyoshi facilities. [...] It was agreed that the partnership would be reorganized as a joint-stock company when treaty would allow it. On July 17, 1899, the revised treaty between Japan and the United States went into effect.

50|$|Because of {{the urgent}} need for climactic information, early in 1942 the WPA {{civilian}} punched card project was transformed into a support resource for the Armed Forces. By {{the end of the war}} 80 million cards were punched, many from pre-war weather observation forms of other countries. These cards were summarized into products, such as flying weather and low visibility summaries, which were essential for military operations. Throughout World War II, the AAF Weather Service maintained a Climatology Division with its staff at Headquarters U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) in the Pentagon. In May 1943 the division moved to Asheville, North Carolina where the AAF Weather Wing was <b>organized.</b> <b>The</b> <b>same</b> year the AAF Statistical Services Division was created at Winston-Salem, North Carolina to begin the routine storage and processing of military weather observations. Climatology was a factor in every major or minor WWII operation. The planning for every landing, mission, and offensive, including the D-Day Invasion in 1944 and the atomic bombing of Japan, required extensive climatological preparation and analyses.|$|E
50|$|In “Community Unionism: A Strategy for <b>Organizing</b> in <b>the</b> New Economy”, Black {{highlights}} {{that community}} organizations can be territorial. This {{can lead to}} conflict when two separate groups try to <b>organize</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> community. Black {{also points out that}} conflict may also arise over what the focus of their organizing will be based on. Disagreement on the specific goals of the organization can take the form of short-term and long-term goals. Black also finds that there can be conflict on the internal structure of a community union (specifically, equal participation in the organization).|$|R

50|$|La Cygne {{was founded}} in 1869 {{as soon as the}} people were assured of the {{building}} of a track for the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad. A town company was organized and purchased 1400 acre of land, but had only 140 acre laid out as a town site. La Cygne was incorporated on January 14, 1870, and a board of trustees was appointed. In the fall of that year the town had grown so that it had inhabitants enough to organize as a city of the third class, and F. A. Foote was elected the first mayor. The first school was taught in 1869 in Cady's hall. It was a private subscription school and was kept open until 1870, when the public school house was built. It was a commodious two-story brick building containing the graded and high schools. The Methodist church organized in 1870 and soon after built a house of worship. The Presbyterian church was <b>organized</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> year but had no building for a year afterward.|$|E

The Commanding General of the Venezuelan Air Force, as of July 2015, is Major General Edgar Valentín Cruz Arteaga.|$|E
5000|$|Washburn's motor theory {{attempted}} {{to find common}} ground between the structuralist tradition of her mentor, Titchener, which focused exclusively on consciousness and the rising view of behaviorism, which dismissed consciousness in favor of visible actions. Washburn's motor theory argued that all thought {{can be traced back to}} bodily movements. According to her theory, consciousness arises when a motion or a tendency towards movement is partially inhibited by a tendency towards another movement. In the presence of an object, the senses create an impression of it, including vision, sight, feel etc. This is accompanied by an incipient sense of movement, either towards or from the object. Different objects evoke different senses of motor readiness. When the object is not present, memory re-evokes those sensations. Learning consists of an association of movements into a set of regular series and combinations. When two movements become closely linked in quick succession, the sense of movement from the first primes the next, beginning a series. Ideas are <b>organized</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way. Thinking becomes a derivative of movements of the hands, eyes, vocal cords, and trunk muscles (remember the thinker's pose). In summary: ...|$|E
