I come into the office with this hollow feeling in my stomach lots <b>of</b> <b>time....</b> <b>You</b> get trapped almost. You get too many responsibilities. It's a bellyfull to carry. It's risky. Dangerous. There's the possibility of failure with it every day and every night. But in a way, it's a challenge. It's invigorating. There isn't any point in not being a player – you're here.... It's not only the money. It's the disgrace, yourself, your manhood. I'm not sure I'd have a big problem with that. On the other hand I'm not sure I wouldn't." ...|$|E
500|$|During early development, Rocksteady {{placed a}} {{prototype}} Batmobile {{in the existing}} Arkham City map, and learned that the claustrophobic city designed for Batman to glide and grapple did not work well for driving a vehicle. Gotham City was thus redesigned with wider streets to allow space for the Batmobile and other street traffic to drive without colliding into walls, and buildings were made taller to accommodate the vehicle's ejection ability. To redesign Gotham City, the designers attempted {{to build on the}} previous games' gothic architecture while making a more believable and dense city. Alongside minor elements like neon lights, billboard advertising, and American-style cars, the team developed ideas for shops that could be found in the city, while retaining a grimy, dystopian theme. Describing the design, Hego said: [...] "every kind of element we've added in there ... makes the entire experience feel a little out <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>You</b> couldn't pinpoint whether it's twenty years ago, now or in ten years time." [...] The designers valued making an open world that was [...] "rich, vibrant, dense...and full of interesting things to do" [...] over it just being large.|$|E

500|$|Everything Everything {{went into}} the studio aiming to [...] "make people want to move", and set about {{avoiding}} slower-paced songs that had featured strongly on their previous album. This became apparent to them following the writing of eventual album closer [...] "Warm Healer". Lead vocalist, Jonathan Higgs, told Anthem Magazine that [...] "we kind of ripped up that rule book after realiing, 'Right. Let’s not write something this quiet. Let’s do horrible stuff from now on'". The group worked on ideas for songs as they came to them, rather than their previous method of practising and recording as a live group. Bass guitarist, Jeremy Pritchard, explained to Skiddle that the group were keen to create a record that would [...] "stand up for the huge amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> spend touring a record", which in turn inspired a more pop-oriented sound than had appeared on Arc. Higgs later discussed how they used their previous sound to inform the direction of Get to Heaven, seeking to avoid [...] "quiet songs" [...] and [...] "tenderness" [...] {{in an effort to}} [...] "inject a new fire into ourselves".|$|E

We still love the songs but we'd be excited about doing new things." [...] The following day, they announced that they would finally begin recording new material in January 2017. In December 2016, Judd revealed that the McBusted-recorded song 'Getting It Out' would have appeared on the band's scrapped album.|$|E

Upon graduation, Hill was called up for the army in 1964 but childhood asthma saw him ruled ineligible. This forced him to think about {{what he wanted to do}} for a career. [...] "When you are that age, you think you are going to be in the army two years, it's a huge amount <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>You</b> don't bother worrying about what you are doing.

2500|$|Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks {{states that}} in Judaism humility is an {{appreciation}} of oneself, one's talents, skills, and virtues. [...] It is not meekness or self-deprecating thought, but the effacing of oneself to something higher. [...] Humility is not to think lowly of oneself, but to appreciate the self one has received. In recognition of the mysteries and complexities of life, one becomes humbled to the awesomeness one is and what one can achieve. [...] Rabbi Pini Dunner discusses that humility is to place others first; it is to appreciate others' worth as important. [...] In recognizing our worth as people, Rabbi Dunner shows that looking into the zillions of stars in the sky, and in the length and history <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> and I are insignificant, like dust. Rabbi Dunner states that Moses wrote in the Torah, [...] "And Moses was exceedingly humble, more than any man {{on the face of}} the earth." [...] How is it possible to be humble and write you are the most humble? The conclusion is that Moses knew he was humble. It is not in denial of your talents and gifts but to recognize them and live up to your worth and something greater. [...] It is in the service to others that is the greatest form of humility.|$|E
