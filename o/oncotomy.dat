40|$|The authors {{present the}} case of a 52 -year-old man who had {{recurring}} scrotal abscesses resulting in <b>oncotomy</b> being carried out seven times within 2 years. Eventually, it was dissected out totally. Histology proved anaplastic cancer metastasis. The primary tumor was detected in the bronchia; moreover, metastases were found in other organs as well. The patient died 6 weeks after the first diagnosis. We intended to draw attention to frequently occurring scrotal inflammation and thus the underlying diseases. We emphasize the importance of histology examinations...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to study the dynamics of some activity indexes of lipid peroxidation in the tissue of primary cerebral tumours and brain metastases tumours {{for the purpose of}} treatment optimization. Materials and Methods. There have been studied tumour tissue samples (anaplastic gliomas and benign astrocytomas) and their perifocal areas taken from the patients during the <b>oncotomy</b> operations and the surgeries on brain metastases tissues excision (breast cancer, lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, skin melanoma). Results. Primary malignancies and brain cancer metastases of various localization have been stated to have common biochemical mechanisms. There has been noticed the more aggressive “metabolic” nature of brain cancer metastases of various localization compared to malignant gliomas. The metastases near hypothalamus as well as multiple metastases have been revealed to be of more aggressive nature...|$|E
