40|$|ABSTRACT Drainage {{construction}} on the Delmarva Peninsula was started in colonial times in the 1700 ’s. Most of the drainage is <b>open</b> <b>ditch</b> <b>drainage</b> with very little tile drainage. Environmental issues became a concern in drainage projects in the 1970 ’s. Some controlled drainage was installed in the late 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s {{in some of the}} tax ditches. A number of drainage water quality studies have been reported. Ritter and Chirnside (1986) in a three year study, found phosphorus concentrations were increased by drainage construction. In another study herbicides were leached rapidly to shallow groundwater shortly after they were applied in both controlled and uncontrolled drainage sites. The Soil Conservation Service evaluated the effect of drainage on sediment yield over a 16 year period. Drainage decreased sediment yield. Several more recent studies have shown drainage ditches may release ortho phosphorus from bottom sediments and transport it to the estuaries along with high nitrate loads in baseflow...|$|E
40|$|<b>Open</b> <b>ditch</b> <b>drainage</b> has {{historically}} been a common land management practice in upland blanket peats, particularly in the UK. However, peatland drainage is now generally considered to have adverse effects on the upland environment, including increased peak flows. As a result, drain blocking has become a common management strategy in the UK over recent years, although there is only anecdotal {{evidence to suggest that}} this might decrease peak flows. The change in the hydrological regime associated with the drainage of blanket peat and the subsequent blocking of drains is poorly understood, therefore a new physics-based model has been developed that allows the exploration of the associated hydrological processes. A series of simulations is used to explore the response of intact, drained and blocked drain sites at field scales. While drainage is generally found to increase peak flows, the effect of drain blocking appears to be dependent on local conditions, sometimes decreasing and sometimes increasing peak flows. Based on insights from these simulations we identify steep smooth drains as those that would experience the greatest reduction in field-scale peak flows if blocked and recommend that future targeted field studies should be focused on examining surface runoff characteristics...|$|E

40|$|A field {{experiment}} established in 1980 {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of <b>open</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>ditch</b> applied for water removal on bacterial and fungal communities of cold waterlogged paddy soils in 2011. In this experiment, traditional plate counting and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis were employed to characterize the abundance and diversity of soil bacterial and fungal communities. Four different distances from the <b>open</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>ditch,</b> 5, 15, 25 and 75 m with different degrees of drainage were designed for this study. Maximum populations of culturable aerobic bacteria and fungi were at 15 -m distance while minimum populations were at 75 -m distance. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) in fungal populations were observed at all distances from <b>open</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>ditch.</b> The highest diversity of the bacterial community was found {{at a distance of}} 25 m, while that of the fungal community was observed at a distance of 5 m. Sequencing of excised TGGE bands indicated that the dominant bacteria at 75 -m distance belonged to anaerobic or microaerobic bacteria. Relationships between microbial characteristics and soil physicochemical properties indicated that soil pH and available nitrogen contents were key factors controlling the abundance of culturable aerobic bacteria and fungi, while soil water capacity also affected the diversity of fungal community.

40|$|<b>Open</b> <b>ditch</b> <b>drainage</b> is a {{commonly}} implemented land management practice in upland blanket peatlands, {{particularly in the}} UK, where policy decisions between the 1940 s and 1970 s led to widespread drainage of the uplands. The change in the hydrological regime associated with the drainage of blanket peat is poorly understood, yet has perceived importance for flooding, low flows and water quality. We propose a new simplified physics-based model that allows the associated hydrological processes and flow responses to be explored. The model couples four one-dimensional models to represent a three-dimensional hillslope, allowing for the exploration of flow and water table response throughout the model domain {{for a range of}} drainage configurations and peat properties. The model is tested against a data set collected from Oughtershaw Beck, UK, with results showing good model performance for wet periods although less conformity with borehole observations during rewetting periods. A wider exploration of model behaviour indicates that the model is consistent with the hydrological response reported in the literature for a number of drained blanket peat sites, and therefore has potential to provide guidance to decision makers concerning the effects of management practices. Through a global sensitivity analysis, we conclude that further field investigations to assist in the surface and drain roughness parameterisation would help reduce the uncertainty in the model predictions...|$|E

40|$|In {{northeast}} Italy, {{a regimen}} of controlled drainage {{in winter and}} subirrigation in summer was tested as a strategy for continuous water table management with the benefits of optimizing water use and reducing unnecessary drainage and nitrogen losses from agricultural fields. To study the feasibility and performance of water table management, an experimental facility {{was set up in}} 1996 to reproduce a hypothetical 6 -ha agricultural basin with different land drainage systems existing in the region. Four treatments were compared: <b>open</b> <b>ditches</b> with free <b>drainage</b> and no irrigation (O), <b>open</b> <b>ditches</b> with controlled <b>drainage</b> and subirrigation (O-CI), subsurface corrugated drains with free drainage and no irrigation (S), subsurface corrugated drains with controlled drainage and subirrigation (S-CI). As typically in the region free <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> were spaced 30 Â m apart, and subsurface corrugated drains were spaced 8 Â m apart. Data were collected from 1997 to 2003 on water table depth, drained volume, nitrate-nitrogen concentration in the drainage water, and nitrate-nitrogen concentration in the groundwater at various depths up to 3 Â m. Subsurface corrugated drains with free drainage (S) gave the highest measured drainage volume of the four regimes, discharging, on average, more than 50 % of annual rainfall, the second-highest concentration of nitrate-nitrogen in the drainage water, and the highest nitrate-nitrogen losses at 236 Â kÂ ha- 1. <b>Open</b> <b>ditches</b> with free <b>drainage</b> (O) showed 18 % drainage return of rainfall, relatively low concentration of nitrate-nitrogen in the drainage water, the highest nitrate-nitrogen concentration in the shallow groundwater, and 51 Â kgÂ ha- 1 nitrate-nitrogen losses. Both treatments with controlled drainage and subirrigation (O-CI and S-CI) showed annual rainfall drainage of approximately 10 %. O-CI showed the lowest nitrate-nitrogen concentration in the drainage water, and the lowest nitrogen losses (15 Â kgÂ ha- 1). S-CI showed the highest nitrate-nitrogen concentration in the drainage water, and 70 Â kgÂ ha- 1 nitrate-nitrogen losses. Reduced drained volumes resulted from the combined effects of reduced peak flow and reduced number of days with drainage. A linear relationship between daily cumulative nitrate-nitrogen losses and daily cumulative drainage volumes was found, with slopes of 0. 16, 0. 12, 0. 07, and 0. 04 Â kgÂ ha- 1 of nitrate-nitrogen lost per mm of drained water in S-CI, S, O, and O-CI respectively.

40|$|The {{study of}} runoff {{is a crucial}} issue because it {{is closely related to}} flooding, water quality and erosion. In {{cultivated}} catchments, agricultural <b>ditch</b> <b>drainage</b> networks are known to influence runoff. As anthropogenic elements, agricultural <b>ditch</b> <b>drainage</b> networks can therefore be altered to better manage surface runoff in cultivated catchments. However, the relationship between the spatial configuration, i. e., the density and the topology, of agricultural <b>ditch</b> <b>drainage</b> networks and surface runoff in cultivated catchments is not understood. We studied this relationship by using a random network simulator that was coupled to a distributed hydrological model. The simulations explored a large variety of spatial configurations corresponding to a thousand stochastic agricultural <b>ditch</b> <b>drainage</b> networks on a 6. 4 km 2 Mediterranean cultivated catchment. Next, several distributed hydrological functions were used to compute water flow-paths and runoff for each simulation. The results showed that (i) denser networks increased the drained volume and the peak discharge and decreased hillslopes runoff, (ii) greater network density did not affect the surface runoff any further above a given network density, (iii) the correlation between network density and runoff was weaker for small subcatchments (< 2 km 2) where the variability in the drained area that resulted from changes in agricultural <b>ditch</b> <b>drainage</b> networks increased the variability of runoff and (iv) the actual agricultural <b>ditch</b> <b>drainage</b> network appeared to be well optimized for managing runoff as compared with the simulated networks.

2500|$|The {{other major}} problem facing the new viceroy was drainage, a {{perennial}} problem for Mexico City resulting in major flooding {{from the early}} sixteenth century through to the late nineteenth century.

Allen Abstract: The loss of nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P), in agricultural drainage waters {{is a priority}} conservation concern. <b>Open</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> concentrate runoff and therefore offer opportunities for capturing P in runoff from large areas of land. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the potential to use P sorbing materials in <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> to sequester dissolved P from ditch water. We describe factors affecting the selection of P sorbing materials for use in treating ditch water and review several approaches to their application in ditches. In addi-tion, experiential insight is provided with regard to developing and installing a P removal structure within a ditch that has high concentrations of dissolved P in flow. Preliminary data indicate that such structures have great promise in treating not only dissolved P in ditch flow, but also trace metals (arsenic, copper, nickel, zinc). Key words: drainage ditches—phosphorus removal structure—phosphorus sorbing materials—water quality Concern over accelerated eutrophica-tion in many agricultural watersheds has focused attention on novel manage-ment practices to reduce phosphorus (P) transfers from agricultural fields to down-stream surface waters (Sims et al. 1998; He et al. 2006). Although the existing man-agement practices can successfully reduce particulate P losses to surface waters, rela-tively few management practices have been developed to curtail dissolved P transfers (Sharpley 1992).

25|$|During {{this period}} of expansion, farmers {{introduced}} modern production practices. The widespread use of modern inputs—chemical fertilisers and insecticides, agricultural machinery, and improved seed varieties—sharply improved crop yields. Yet the modernisation process again made farm production dependent on supplies from abroad, this time on imports of petroleum and fertilisers. By 1984 domestic sources of energy covered only about 20 percent of farm needs, while in 1950 domestic sources had supplied 70 percent of them. In {{the aftermath of the}} oil price increases of the early 1970s, farmers began to return to local energy sources such as firewood. The existence of many farms that were too small to allow efficient use of tractors also limited mechanisation. Another weak point was the existence of many fields with <b>open</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> needing regular maintenance; in the mid-1980s, experts estimated that half of the cropland needed improved drainage works.
