5|$|Armillaria luteobubalina {{was first}} {{described}} in 1978, {{after having been}} discovered several years earlier growing in a Eucalyptus plantation in southeastern Australia. It distinguished itself from other known Australian Armillaria species by its aggressive pathogenicity. It may take years for infected trees to show signs <b>of</b> <b>disease,</b> leading to an underestimation <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> prevalence. Studies show that the spread <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps left following logging operations. Although several methods have been suggested to control the spread <b>of</b> <b>disease,</b> they are largely economically or environmentally unfeasible. Phylogenetic analyses have determined that A.luteobubalina {{is closely related to}} A.montagnei and that both of these species are in turn closely related to the Brazilian species A.paulensis. The distribution of A.luteobubalina suggests that it is an ancient species that originated before the separation of the precursor supercontinent Gondwana.|$|E
5|$|The spread <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> was {{significantly}} more rampant {{in areas of}} poverty. Epidemics ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread <b>of</b> <b>disease</b> than {{the children of the}} wealthy.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We discuss an {{consideration}} on identity <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> {{based on}} an ontological model <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> as causal chains. Because we define an individual disease is constituted by a causal chain, changes of the causal chain implies changes <b>of</b> the <b>disease.</b> That is, in order to consider an identity <b>of</b> <b>diseases,</b> we have to investigate how an identity of a causal chain changes. For this purpose, we introduce a classification of causal inks and causal chains. Then, we propose an ontological model to deal with identity <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> as causal chains. It would contribute to the ontological treatment of identity <b>of</b> a <b>disease</b> in medical information systems. ...|$|R

The long-held idea that living organisms could easily originate from nonliving matter (spontaneous generation) was attacked {{in a series of}} experiments carried out by Louis Pasteur, while debates over vitalism vs. mechanism (a perennial issue since the time of Aristotle and the Greek atomists) continued apace.|$|E
