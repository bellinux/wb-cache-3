5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to <b>offer</b> <b>me</b> in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
25|$|Sedative-hypnotics such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and the {{barbiturates}} {{are known}} for the severe physical dependence that {{they are capable of}} inducing which can result in severe withdrawal effects. This severe neuroadaptation is even more profound in high dose drug users and misusers. A high degree of tolerance often occurs in chronic benzodiazepine abusers due to the typically high doses they consume which can lead to a severe benzodiazepine dependence. The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome seen in chronic high dose benzodiazepine abusers is similar to that seen in therapeutic low dose users but of a more severe nature. Extreme antisocial behaviors in obtaining continued supplies and severe drug-seeking behavior when withdrawals occur. The severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome has been described by one benzodiazepine drug misuser who stated that I'd rather withdraw off heroin any day. If I was withdrawing from benzos you could <b>offer</b> <b>me</b> a gram of heroin or just 20mg of diazepam and I'd take the diazepam every time– I've never been so frightened in my life. Those who use benzodiazepines intermittently are less likely to develop a dependence and withdrawal symptoms upon dose reduction or cessation of benzodiazepines than those who use benzodiazepines on a daily basis.|$|E

500|$|Blount was not {{reinstated}} in {{time for}} the Stanford game, but two days after the Ducks' loss to Stanford, the Ducks requested, and the Pac-10 approved, Blount's reinstatement for the Ducks' November 14 game against Arizona State. Blount released a statement thanking head coach Kelly for showing that he [...] "cares enough to <b>offer</b> <b>me</b> this second chance" [...] and that it was up to Blount to [...] "prove to people that their lasting impressions of me are not what they saw in Boise." [...] Blount suited up for the Arizona State and Arizona games, but since his replacement, LaMichael James, was playing so well, Blount did not see any playing time in those games.|$|E
500|$|From 1848 to 1864, Denmark and the German Confederation {{fought over}} control of the two duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Historically, the duchies had been ruled by Denmark since medieval times, but there {{remained}} a large German majority. This majority was sparked to rebellion after Frederick VII of Denmark announced on 27 March 1848 the duchies would {{become an integral part of}} Denmark under his new liberal constitution. Prussia soon became involved, supporting the uprising and beginning the First Schleswig War. Ernest sent 8,000 men initially, adding to the army sent by the German Confederation. He also desired to be given a military job during the war, but was refused, as it was [...] "extremely difficult to <b>offer</b> <b>me</b> a position in the army of Schleswig-Holstein corresponding to my rank", according to his memoirs. He agreed to a smaller command, coming to lead a Thuringian contingent; he commented in a letter to his brother that [...] "I should have declined any other command of the kind, but I could not refuse this one, as, in the present condition of our States, it is important to keep the executive power in our hands". As commander of a German corps, Ernest was instrumental in winning the 5 April 1849 battle of Eckernförde against Danish forces.|$|E

[...] He explained that after the bombing at Pearl Harbor, {{he was prepared to}} fight in the war until he read about the American terms of unconditional surrender that he feared would lead to the [...] "permanent destruction of Germany and Japan." [...] Before Lowell was transferred to the prison in Connecticut, he was held in a prison in New York City that he later wrote about in the poem [...] "Memories of West Street and Lepke" [...] from his book Life Studies.|$|E
