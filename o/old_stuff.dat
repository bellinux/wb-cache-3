500|$|The {{character}} of Charlie Chan {{was created by}} Earl Derr Biggers. In 1919, while visiting Hawaii, Biggers planned a detective novel to be called The House Without a Key. He did not begin to write that novel until four years later, however, when he was inspired to add a Chinese-American police officer to the plot after reading in a newspaper of Chang Apana (鄭阿平) and Lee Fook, two detectives on the Honolulu police force. Biggers, who disliked the Yellow Peril stereotypes he found {{when he came to}} California, explicitly conceived of the character as an alternative: [...] "Sinister and wicked Chinese are <b>old</b> <b>stuff,</b> but an amiable Chinese on the side of law and order has never been used." ...|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr {{described}} {{how difficult it}} was to be accepted as a female photographer in the 1960s: [...] "Every magazine and newspaper wanted me to photograph the Beatles again. Or they wanted my <b>old</b> <b>stuff,</b> even if it was out of focus, whether they were nice or not. They wouldn't look at my other work. It was very hard for a girl photographer in the 60s to be accepted. In the end I gave up. I've hardly taken a photo since 1967." [...] Kirchherr was quoted as saying that When We Was Fab (Genesis Publications 2007), would be her last book of photographs: [...] "I have decided it is time to create one book in which I am totally involved so that it contains the pictures I like most, printed the way I would print them, even down to the text and design.... This book is me and that is why it will be the last one. The very last one." ...|$|E

500|$|However, Trio members never {{claimed to}} be folksingers and were never {{comfortable}} with the label. The liner notes for the group's first album featured a quotation from Dave Guard asserting that [...] "We are not folksingers in the accepted sense of the word." [...] Guard later told journalist Richard Hadlock in Down Beat magazine: [...] "We are not students of folk music; the basic thing for us is honest and worthwhile songs that people can pick up and become involved in." [...] Nick Reynolds added in the same article: [...] "We don't collect old songs {{in the sense that}} the academic cats do... We get new tunes to look over every day. Each one of us has his ears open constantly to new material or <b>old</b> <b>stuff</b> that's good." [...] Bob Shane remarked years later: [...] "To call the Kingston Trio folksingers was kind of stupid in the first place. We never called ourselves folksingers... We did folk-oriented material, but we did it amid all kinds of other stuff. But they didn't know what to call us with our instruments, so Capitol Records called us folksingers and gave us credit for starting this whole boom." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A {{lot of people want to}} hear the <b>old</b> <b>stuff,</b> and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{untitled}} record (typically {{known as}} LP5 or simply Autechre) followed in 1998. It {{has been seen}} as a transitional work, with Brown commenting in 2005 that [...] "a lot of people have cited it as a classic Autechre album because it bridges the gap between the guys who liked our <b>old</b> <b>stuff</b> and the guys who got propelled on to our new stuff." ...|$|E

5000|$|In March 2015, Solomon {{changed his}} stage name to Solomon Ray. He told Out Magazine, Advocate and HIV Plus Magazine, “The music I’m {{doing now is}} {{different}} and more refined. I can’t group it together with my <b>older</b> <b>stuff.</b> So I felt a new name was appropriate. Still Solomon, but just a different ending.” [...] To coincide with his name change the artist released a cover of Beck's [...] "Guess I'm Doing Fine".|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} studio {{recording}}, the song {{became part of}} the Dominos live set. Although it did not appear on their 1973 In Concert album, a recording from the Fillmore East on October 24, 1970 was later included on the expanded Live at the Fillmore album released in 1994. For this version, Clapton played all the guitar parts and Whitlock performed on piano. In 1992, Clapton recorded another rendition for the MTV Unplugged series. In keeping with the show's theme, the song was performed in an acoustic style. Clapton recounted: [...] "I also enjoyed going back and playing the <b>old</b> <b>stuff</b> like 'Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out', which was how it all started back in Kingston [...] so long ago." [...] The version from Unplugged was released as a special limited edition single in Argentina, where it reached number eight on the record chart in 1992 and was certified as a [...] "gold" [...] record (50,000 copies shipped).|$|E
2500|$|Leslie then {{produced}} {{her entire}} album, {{which is a}} mix of pop and R Cassie described her sound as [...] "mellow, chill, and easy to relate to. This album represents what I've always wanted to do." [...] She said in another interview, [...] "I rap, I sing, I do my R, I do my slow songs and stuff that the girls will love, I have a down South joint, I have a rock song that I did with my girls–this band called Pretty Boys. [...] It has some funk, some <b>old</b> <b>stuff,</b> it's really fun." [...] She paid tribute to her Filipino culture by incorporating OPM sounds into some of the ballads. While describing the process of working with Leslie, she stated, [...] "I will talk about situations that I was going through at the time and we'll talk about that and it comes straight from the heart that's why it works out well between us," [...] continuing about her songwriting input, [...] "I was just kind of going along with it trying to get the vibe. I'm starting to get into it and I'm excited to write." [...] Cassie also mentioned [...] "Not With You" [...] was one of her favorite songs, [...] "It's slow, it's simple, and you get to really hear me as opposed to all the synthesizers and everything in the background," [...] and compared the second single, [...] "Long Way 2 Go," [...] to Vanity 6's vibe. [...] "I'm hoping to show I can do a wide range of things," [...] concluding, [...] "The whole album really just goes back to love songs." ...|$|E

[...] "I'm not saying it's not good stuff to pull, but it's <b>old</b> <b>stuff</b> now. I'm sorry for you, but I thought of it before you did.

I really like country and folk music, so I think it's always going to come through. Maybe this time it's come through in a more authentic way, rather than playing with a genre, just playing it because we like it. I think the guitar-picking stuff on this record mostly comes from Bob Dylan or Nick Drake {{and that sort of}} stuff, more folk kind of things." ...|$|R
