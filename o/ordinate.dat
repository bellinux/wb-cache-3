40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that the periodogram <b>ordinates</b> of an lid mean-zero Gaussian sequence at the Fourier frequencies constitute an lid exponential vector, hence the maximum of these periodogram <b>ordinates</b> has a limiting Gumbel distribution. We show for a non-Gaussian lid mean-zero, finite variance sequence that this statement remains valid. We also prove that the point process constructed from the periodogram <b>ordinates</b> converges to a Poisson process. This implies the joint weak convergence of the upper order statistics of the periodogram <b>ordinates.</b> These results are {{in agreement with the}} empirically observed phenomenon that various functionals of the periodogram <b>ordinates</b> of an lid finite variance sequence have very much the same asymptotic behavior as the same functionals applied to an lid exponential sample...|$|R

These covariances among Fourier spectral <b>ordinates</b> {{can be used}} to generate accelerograms within a stochastic simulation framework that offer improvements over traditional approaches that make use of deterministic Fourier amplitude spectra combined with a random phase spectrum. The article demonstrates that the accelerograms generated in this new way result in response spectral <b>ordinates</b> that have variances that are very consistent with those predicted by empirical ground‐motion models. In addition, the interperiod {{correlations among}} response spectral <b>ordinates</b> obtained from the simulated motions are also consistent with empirically derived response spectral correlations. The study partitions the variance among Fourier spectral <b>ordinates</b> into between‐event, between‐site and within‐event components, and interfrequency correlation models, and variance models are derived for each component. The between‐event correlations are found to exhibit a mild degree of magnitude dependence. An important feature of the new correlation and variance models is that they {{can be used to}} generate accelerograms that are broadly consistent with conditional response spectra. This new approach has significant implications for response‐history analyses within earthquake engineering that make use of conditional spectra as a target...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} code, DRC 3, {{has been}} developed for coupling Monte Carlo adjoint leakages with three-dimensional discrete <b>ordinates</b> forward fluences in order to solve a special category of geometrically-complex deep penetration shielding problems. The code extends the capabilities of earlier methods that coupled Monte Carlo adjoint leakages with two-dimensional discrete <b>ordinates</b> forward fluences. The problems involve the calculation of fluences and responses in a perturbation to an otherwise simple two- or three-dimensional radiation field. In general, the perturbation complicates the geometry such that it cannot be modeled exactly using any of the discrete <b>ordinates</b> geometry options and thus a direct discrete <b>ordinates</b> solution is not possible. Also, the calculation of radiation transport from the source to the perturbation involves deep penetration. One approach to solving such problems is to perform the calculations in three steps: (1) a forward discrete <b>ordinates</b> calculation, (2) a localized adjoint Monte Carlo calculation, and (3) a coupling of forward fluences from the first calculation with adjoint leakages from the second calculation to obtain the response of interest (fluence, dose, etc.). A description {{of this approach is}} presented along with results from test problems used to verify the method. The test problems that were selected could also be solved directly by the discrete <b>ordinates</b> method.

2500|$|De Morgan's work {{entitled}} Trigonometry and Double Algebra {{consists of}} two parts; the former {{of which is a}} treatise on trigonometry, and the latter a treatise on generalized algebra which he called [...] "double algebra". The first stage in the development of algebra is arithmetic, where numbers only appear and symbols of operations such as , , etc. The next stage is universal arithmetic, where letters appear instead of numbers, so as to denote numbers universally, and the processes are conducted without knowing the values of the symbols. Let [...] and [...] denote any numbers; then such an expression as [...] may be impossible; so that in universal arithmetic there is always a proviso, provided the operation is possible. The third stage is single algebra, where the symbol may denote a quantity forwards or a quantity backwards, and is adequately represented by segments on a straight line passing through an origin. Negative quantities are then no longer impossible; they are represented by the backward segment. But an impossibility still remains {{in the latter part of}} such an expression as [...] which arises in the solution of the quadratic equation. The fourth stage is double algebra. The algebraic symbol denotes in general a segment of a line in a given plane. It is a double symbol because it involves two specifications, namely, length, and direction; and [...] is interpreted as denoting a quadrant. The expression [...] then represents a line in the plane having an abscissa [...] and an <b>ordinate</b> [...] Argand and Warren carried double algebra so far but they were unable to interpret on this theory such an expression as [...] De Morgan attempted it by reducing such an expression to the form , and he considered that he had shown that it could be always so reduced. The remarkable fact is that this double algebra satisfies all the fundamental laws above enumerated, and as every apparently impossible combination of symbols has been interpreted it looks like the complete form of algebra.
