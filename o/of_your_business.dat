25|$|In 1988, Morrissey {{launched}} his solo career with Viva Hate. This album and its follow-ups—Bona Drag, Kill Uncle, Your Arsenal, and Vauxhall and I—all {{did well in}} the UK Albums Chart and spawned a number of hit singles. During this time his image began to shift into that of a burlier figure, who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his subsequent albums, Southpaw Grammar and Maladjusted, also charted but were less well received. Relocating to Los Angeles, he embarked on a hiatus between 1998 and 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, You Are the Quarry, in 2004. Ensuing years saw the release of albums Ringleader of the Tormentors, Years of Refusal, and World Peace Is None <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Business.</b> He released his autobiography in 2013, followed by his first novel in 2015. His eleventh solo album, Low in High School, is set {{to be released in}} November 2017.|$|E

40|$|When {{it comes}} to {{employee}} compensation, most managers are busy asking: “What do I {{have to pay to}} …. ? ” That is not an easy question to answer. A better question might be: “What do I want my compensation package to say? ” Whether you realize it or not, it is already saying a lot. The benefits, bonuses, and incentives <b>your</b> <b>business</b> offers speak volumes as far as your employees are concerned. Child care and health benefits say that you value family. Longevity bonuses for employees on the anniversary of their employment with you says that you value employees who stay with the business. Throwing a party at the end <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>business’s</b> busy season lets the employees and their families know that you appreciate it when your people go the extra mile. Bonuses, profit sharing plans, and other incentives are amazing managerial tools, but they can also become a slippery slope if you aren’t careful.
