5|$|Bottom time is {{the time}} spent at depth before {{starting}} the ascent. Bottom time used for decompression planning may be defined differently depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases. It is important to check how bottom time is defined for the tables before they are used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define bottom time as the elapsed time between leaving the surface {{and the start of}} the final ascent at 10 metres per minute, and if the ascent rate is slower, then the whole of the ascent time needs to be considered part of the bottom time for the algorithm to remain safe.|$|E

500|$|Lloyd and {{the troupe}} made their début at a mission in Nile Street, Hoxton, in 1880 and {{followed}} this with an {{appearance at the}} Blue Ribbon Gospel Temperance Mission later the same year. [...] Costumed by Matilda, they toured local doss-houses in East London, where they performed temperance songs, teaching people the dangers of alcohol abuse. [...] Eager {{to show off his}} daughter's talent, John secured her unpaid employment as a table singer at the Eagle Tavern in Hoxton, where he worked as a waiter. Among the songs she performed there was [...] "My Soldier Laddie". Together with her performances at the Eagle, Lloyd briefly contributed to the family income by making babies' boots, and, later, curled feathers for hat making. [...] She was unsuccessful at both and was sacked from the latter after being caught dancing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> by the foreman. She returned home that evening and declared that she wanted a permanent career on the stage. [...] Although happy to have her performing in her spare time, her parents initially opposed the idea of her appearing on the stage full-time.

2500|$|In his autobiography, Buck Clayton shared {{some of his}} {{memories}} of the Dunbar. He recalled the Dunbar as “jumping” with loads {{of people trying to}} get a glimpse of the celebrities, and parties thrown by Duke Ellington and his guys with “chicks and champagne everywhere.” Clayton recalled an instance when Ellington and his orchestra came to Los Angeles shortly after the 1932 release of the song It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing). Ellington’s band was in the Dunbar restaurant when the song came on the jukebox. It was the first time since leaving New York that they had heard their recording. Clayton described the band's response: “So much rhythm I've never heard, as guys were beating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> instrument cases or anything else they could beat on with knives, forks, rolled-up newspapers or anything else they could find to make rhythm. [...] It was absolutely crazy.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Between {{the two of}} them, Powell and Rothe began {{a series}} of reforms which were {{targeted}} at updating the facility.

[...] A training regimen for the guards was also instilled, which bettered communication between shifts and cut back on guard contributions to the black market. Something they were unable to initiate until too late was the removal of firearms from the cellblocks; Powell and Rothe wanted to completely sweep both cellblocks of the rifles the guards carried on the catwalks. [...] They saw the [...]30-30 Winchester rifles' presence as an instigator for inmate uprising, but the guards refused to surrender the guns.|$|E

2500|$|Toni {{was later}} {{inducted}} into the Marxist club formed by Constantin Mille at Sotir Hall, Bucharest, and lectured for the public on a weekly basis. Author Constantin Kirițescu, who joined the Sotir group as a 17-year-old, recalls that both men [...] "carried the brunt" [...] of organizing and educating the socialist sympathizers. According to journalist I. Felea, Toni, who [...] "resembled Ferdinand Lassalle in looks and speech", was {{a favorite of the}} Bucharest workers, and made an impression on them by touching the issue of penniless senior citizens. Bacalbașa himself did not have a stable domicile, and slept <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> at Sotir. By 1893, Kirițescu notes, the task of representing [...] "Marxist orthodoxy" [...] had fallen on a new arrival, Ioan Nădejde; the [...] "occult leader" [...] Dobrogeanu-Gherea, already [...] "an invalid", was rarely visiting the club, and was losing support among the rank and file. Two other figures, Alexandru Ionescu and Alexandru Georgescu, represented the working class on the Sotir presidium, but they were both in the process of becoming prosperous businessmen.|$|E
2500|$|Cinematographer Adam Greenberg, whose {{previous}} film credits included Three Men and a Baby, La Bamba and Near Dark, {{approached the}} film {{with a unique}} documentary-style technique. Commenting on the initial photography lighting tests, Greenberg remarked, [...] "The first ones were a disaster. They didn't look good at all. I didn't know how to photograph these aliens. It {{was the first time}} I had to deal with this kind of thing. But I have an eye and I learned from these tests." [...] At the Biltmore Hotel, a peculiar situation arose where the ceilings were simply too tall for standard lighting equipment. An ingenious idea was devised by the crew to have six to eight weather balloons sent up and have artificial light bounce off of them to create the proper lighting mood. Greenberg remarked, [...] "I wanted a very rich look from that place, gold and very warm. In the story it is very late after a big party. I wasn't going for any special effect, just nice light from lamps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables.</b> The problem was, the hotel management wouldn't let us hang anything from the ceiling. In pre-production they had told us we could hang lights, but I didn't believe them. The ceilings there are very high and very beautiful." ...|$|E

[...] Once the German Jews arrived on the Riga transports in December, 1941, they were sent to the ghetto, where they found that the houses had obviously been left in a hurry.

2500|$|One of {{the largest}} N scale layouts {{in the world is}} located at the San Diego Model Railroad Museum. Pacific Desert Lines [...] is a [...] layout {{featuring}} hand-laid code 40 rail. Each piece of rail is [...] (forty thousandths) high and is manually affixed to the roadbed by solder to copper-clad ties placed every 5th tie. About [...] (scale miles, actually [...] ) of mainline track are on this massive layout, as well as over 500 hand-made turnouts. Many models of local San Diego structures can be identified on the layout, including an intricate scale model of San Diego's Santa Fe Depot, the Western Metal Supply Building, the Carrizo Gorge's Goat Canyon Trestle, Palomar Observatory, the American Agar building, and the Carlsbad, California flower fields and power plant. The model of the Santa Fe depot was constructed using the actual building's blueprints and has been featured on the cover of Model Railroader magazine. The Spanish revival architecture is reproduced using epoxy castings of scale model adobe roof tiles. The Western Metal Supply Building (now part of the left field foul line in the San Diego Padres' Petco Park) was constructed using historic photographs and contains brick castings, brass-etched fire escapes, and computer-generated window panes. The detail on the Goat Canyon Trestle includes the prototype's railings, catwalks, and fire suppression system. The power plant contains fibre-optic strobe lights in its chimney. Many buildings have detailed interiors, right down to the napkin dispenser and placemats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> at the corner cafe. Some surfers appear in the water off the coast. The layout can be operated by manual or computer control. Trains can run completely unattended or a single operator can control the layout with the click of a mouse.|$|E
