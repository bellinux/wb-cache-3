5|$|August 15, 1787: The Four-State Tornado Swarm of 1787 was {{the largest}} tornado {{outbreak}} recorded to date, and affected most of New England.

A mother and two <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> were killed in Wethersfield, and 10 others were injured before the tornado lifted outside of the town.

50|$|The current {{position}} of the English courts has been criticised as leading to unfair results both in law and from the medical point of view.

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of this study is to clarify how the mother with an {{adolescent}} <b>child</b> accepts independence <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>child.</b> More specific purposes are as follows (1) what kind of effect does the father 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with his family have on the mother 2 ̆ 7 s acceptance <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>child</b> 2 ̆ 7 s independence? (2) what kind of feelings does the accepting mother and the less accepting mother have respectively regarding the independence <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>child?</b> (3) what kind of relationships are there between the mother 2 ̆ 7 s feelings toward <b>her</b> <b>child</b> and the father 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with his family? Main results are as follows: (1) more accepting mothers for independence of their children recognized more emotional interactions between the child and the father. (2) more accepting mothers for independence of their children trusted the growth of their children, and less accepting mothers felt loneliness toward the growth of their children. (3) when the emotional interactions between the father and the family was higher, the mothers self-involvement to her individual role was higher and <b>her</b> sense <b>of</b> loneliness toward the growth <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>child</b> was lower. Furthermore, the more the father spends time with his Family, cooperates with his wife, and has direct interactions with his child, the less sense of loneliness the mother has toward the growth <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>child...</b>|$|R

Potter liked the suggestion, and, in 1900, revised a tale she had written for five-year-old Noel Moore in 1893, and fashioned a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1899 bestseller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer for the tale, she published it {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901.|$|E
