40|$|The Modified Cam Clay (MCC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used soil models, which is very popular in the world. It was developed by the researchers at the University of Cambridge, U. K. This MCC model has gained general acceptance amongst the researchers in the field of geotechnical engineering. Some commercial softwares for geotechnical problems are using the MCC model as the basis of analysis. The MCC model undoubtedly works very well for predicting the mechanical behavior of normally consolidated clay, but in reality some soils are in the state of overconsolidated. This study is aimed to find out some pitfalls in using the MCC model in relation to its application on overconsolidated soils. Some data from plane strain testing on the <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clay</b> were used to examine the application of MCC model on <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clay.</b> The results showed that, the MCC model is no longer able to simulate the mechanical behavior of heavily overconsolidated clay; the MCC calculation for heavily <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clay</b> was deviated far below the experimental result.

40|$|Most clays, either {{naturally}} deposited or man-made, {{possess a}} certain degree of overconsolidation owing to tamping, cyclic loading, erosion, excavation, and/or changes in groundwater tables. An easy-to-use constitutive model for <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays</b> is useful for relevant engineering applications. In this paper, a simple model is proposed for <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays</b> based on the unified-hardening (UH) model. To evaluate the potential peak stress ratio of <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays,</b> a parabolic Hvorslev envelope rather than a straight envelope (used in the original UH model) is adopted. The proposed parabolic Hvorslev envelope passes through the origin of the mean stress-deviatoric stress plane. It has a slope of 3 as the overconsolidation ratio (OCR) approaches infinity and intersects with the critical state line as the OCR reaches unity. This modification leads to more realistic predictions for highly <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays</b> than does the original UH model with a straight Hvorslev envelope and is consistent with the critical state soil mechanics in which the higher peak stress ratio in <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays</b> is a result of interlocking (or dilatancy) rather than cohesion. The modified UH model retains the same parameters as those in the modified Cam-clay model. Reasonable agreement between the model predictions and experimental data demonstrates that the modified model is capable of addressing the fundamental behavior of <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays.</b> The present model is developed for reconstituted clays with an isotropic fabric.

Comparisons between predicted and experimental results show the validity and good applicability of the anisotropic model.

40|$|The pre-failure {{behaviour}} of <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays</b> is {{now well}} known to be highly non-linear and inelastic. Conventional constitutive soil models fail to predict this observed behaviour and recently a family of elasto-plastic soil models, the kinematic hardening models, has been developed to overcome these limitations. The kinematic hardening models allow for plasticity and non-linearity to be invoked within the conventionally defined yield surface, through the introduction of kinematic surfaces. The aim of this thesis {{is to improve the}} predictions of the behaviour of <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays,</b> particularly the pre-failure behaviour, through the study of elasto-plastic constitutive models based on this concept. Two existing kinematic hardening models, formulated within the framework of critical state soil mechanics, were chosen to be implemented into the Imperial College Finite Element Program (ICFEP), the two-surface model developed by Al-Tabbaa (1987), and the three-surface model developed by Stallebrass (1990). Both models were generalised in order to make their implementation into a finite element code possible. Although these models form a substantial improvement in modelling the behaviour of <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays</b> they cannot predict a smooth transition from elastic to elasto-plastic behaviour. This feature of behaviour, which proves to be an important drawback when simulating pre-failure non-linearity, was improved by changing the hardening modulus of each model and in this way two new generalised models were formulated. The implementation of the four models into ICFEP was validated through a number of single finite element analyses. The performance of the models was then evaluated through simulation of a series of laboratory tests on <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays</b> and comparison of the predictions with experimental data, where possible. The models were further used in the finite element analyses of two boundary value problems. The first of these modelled an embankment founded on a soft clay deposit. The second boundary value problem involved the analyses of tunnels excavated within the heavily <b>overconsolidated</b> London <b>Clay.</b> An analysis of the twin tunnels beneath St. James's Park, London, constructed as part of the Jubilee Line Extension of the London Underground network, is also presented.

40|$|Based on the {{relationships}} between the Hvorslev envelope, the current yield surface and the reference yield surface, a new constitutive model for <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays</b> is proposed.

The model can describe many characteristics of <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays,</b> including stress-strain relationships, strain hardening and softening, stress dilatancy, and stress path dependency. Compared with the Cam-clay model, the model only requires one additional soil parameter which is the slope of the Hvorslev envelope. Comparisons with data from triaxial drained compression tests for Fujinomori clay show that the proposed model can rationally describe overconsolidated properties. In addition, the model is also used to predict the stress-strain relationship in the isotropic consolidation condition and the stress paths in the undrained triaxial compression tests...|$|R
40|$|A new {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) elastoviscoplastic (EVP) {{constitutive model}} for both normally consolidated and <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays</b> is presented. In developing the new model, first the time effects on clays were {{connected with the}} change of overconsolidation degree according to the concepts of aging time and the instant normal compression line. This made it convenient to combine a logarithmic creep function with the reloading function of the unified hardening (UH) model (a model for <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays),</b> and, thus, an isotropic EVP relationship was built. Second, a time variable derived from the isotropic EVP relationship was embedded into the current yield function of the UH model, and, thereby, a time-dependent current yield function is proposed. Based on the time-dependent current yield function and the flow rule, an EVP model for triaxial compression stress states was built. The EVP model for triaxial compression stress states then was extended to a 3 D EVP model for general stress states through the transformed stress method. The proposed 3 D EVP model can describe time-dependent behaviors, such as creep, relaxation, and loading rate effect, for both normally consolidated and <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays,</b> with two additional parameters compared with the modified Cam-clay model. Finally, numerous experimental results in the literature (such as the results of triaxial undrained creep tests, triaxial undrained compression and extension tests at the constant strain rate, and triaxial undrained tests at the stage-changed strain rate) were used to validate the new model.

40|$|The {{incision}} of {{a natural}} or an artificial slope in a clay deposit initiates a morphological evolution and determines variations of the internal state of stress in the deposit. This evolution can be analyzed considering the variations over time of the lateral stress at rest coefficient K- 0. This paper {{is focused on the}} evolution of the K- 0 in <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clay</b> deposits submitted to the incision of natural slopes. The proposed idea is that, under specific morphological and evolutionary conditions, a value of K- 0 < I could be considered reliable even for medium-high OC clay deposits. This idea is here discussed with the support of in-situ and laboratory data from: i) pressuremeter tests performed in <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clay</b> deposits in Central Italy and ii) a scaled physical modeling experiment reproducing a normally consolidated clay deposit. This study suggests that when dealing with clay deposits subjected to a simultaneous vertical and horizontal unloading due to slope incision, the K- 0 coefficient should be considered a parameter variable {{as a function of the}} different stress-strain evolutions experienced by each portion of the deposit. The portions involved in the slope incision had different evolutions and are represented by different K- 0 values. As a consequence, diverse amounts of decrease distinguish the evolution of the K- 0 for natural rather than artificial slopes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|PhDDiaphragm {{walls are}} being used {{increasingly}} in connection with building basements and road improvement schemes, particularly in urban areas. Many of these walls retain <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clay,</b> and {{the magnitude of the}} lateral stresses which will act on the wall under service conditions is uncertain. One of the reasons for this is that, although the initial in situ lateral effective earth pressures in an <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clay</b> deposit will be high, they will be affected to some extent by the process of installation of the wall. Stress relief which occurs during installation should be taken into account, since it will influence the starting point for analysis of the post-construction behaviour. Ground movements which occur during installation are important in their own right, and might for a diaphragmtype retaining wall be more significant than those which occur during and after excavation in front of the wall. The investigation of this problem using a centrifuge modelling technique is the principal aim of the current research. An extensive literature review has been carried out to collate field data concerning the stress history and in situ lateral stresses of <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clay</b> deposits. These were used to confirm that the proposed centrifuge modelling technique would achieve realistic stress states and changes in stress. A series of centrifuge tests has been carried out at the London Geotechnical Centrifuge Centre (operated jointly by Queen Mary & Westfield College and City University), on samples of overconsolidated speswhite kaolin, simulating the effects of excavation under a slurry trench and concreting the diaphragm wall. The background to the tests, and the geometry and design of the model are discussed.

The UH model can model many characteristics of <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clays</b> well, including stress-strain relationships, shear dilatancy, strain-hardening and softening, and stress path dependence behaviour. The key feature of the model is the adoption of a unified hardening parameter that is independent of stress paths.

Compared with the Cam-clay model, the UH model requires only one additional clay parameter, the slope of the Hvorslev envelope.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades much effort has been spent to {{investigate}} the installation effects of diaphragm wall panels in an overconsolidated deposit. Conversely, in the literature there is relatively little focus on the effects of bored pile construction. In this thesis a number of three dimensional finite difference analyses using FLAC 3 D have been carried out to investigate the stress changes and consequent movements due to bored pile and diaphragm wall installation in stiff clay. The three-dimensional numerical models developed to carry out these analyses were used to analyse, interpret and explain the instrumented data of ground stress changes during bored pile wall installation in an <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clay</b> deposit in connection with the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL; now HS 1) at Ashford. Two different soil models were implemented in the three dimensional finite difference analyses, having linear and non-linear stress strain characteristic. It was found that both analyses could capture the observed pattern of changes in stresses. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} difference in stress changes and ground movements after a single pile or panel installation were primarily a consequence of the different geometry between pile and panel. In the literature, only limited research has been carried out to quantify the three dimensional effects of diaphragm wall installation. For this thesis a number of three dimensional finite difference analyses, using FLAC 3 D, were carried out, to investigate the installation effects of a group of panels in an <b>overconsolidated</b> <b>clay</b> deposit. One of the key uncertainties associated with the design of in situ embedded retaining walls in an overconsolidated deposit concerns the long-term horizontal stress acting on the wall.
