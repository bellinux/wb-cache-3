5|$|Portuguese {{immigrants}} {{had been}} in Hawaii since the whaling days. Many of them were mixed blood Afro-Portuguese sailors who found the brown-skinned Native Hawaiians free of racial bias towards them. The first Portuguese plantation labor emigration to Hawaii came from the Azores and Madeira in 1878, starved out of their homelands by widespread grape vine fungus. They emigrated mostly in family groups, joining an established community of their <b>own</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{school system}} {{was created for}} the purpose of {{removing}} children from the influence of their <b>own</b> <b>culture</b> and assimilating them into the dominant Canadian culture. Over the course of the system's more than hundred-year existence, about 30%, or roughly 150,000, of Indigenous children were placed in residential schools nationally. At least 6,000 of these students are estimated to have died while residents.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of another key social fact: the culture. Groups, when interacting, create their <b>own</b> <b>culture</b> and attach powerful emotions to it. He {{was one of}} the first scholars to consider the question of culture so intensely. Durkheim was interested in cultural diversity, and how the existence of diversity nonetheless fails to destroy a society. To that, Durkheim answered that any apparent cultural diversity is overridden by a larger, common, and more generalized cultural system, and the law.|$|E

5|$|Watership Down is {{a fantasy}} {{adventure}} novel by English author Richard Adams, published by Rex Collings Ltd of London in 1972. Set in southern England, the story features {{a small group}} of rabbits. Although they live in their natural environment, they are anthropomorphised, possessing their <b>own</b> <b>culture,</b> language, proverbs, poetry, and mythology. Evoking epic themes, the novel follows the rabbits as they escape the destruction of their warren and seek a place to establish a new home, encountering perils and temptations along the way.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not without}} conflict, European Canadians' early {{interactions}} with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples {{played a critical}} part {{in the development of}} European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The Crown and indigenous peoples began interactions during the European colonization period, though the Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European settlers. However, from the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged indigenous peoples to assimilate into their <b>own</b> <b>culture.</b> These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations. A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Early Māori {{adapted the}} tropically based east Polynesian culture {{in line with}} the {{challenges}} associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation was largely communal with families (whānau), subtribes (hapū) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira), whose position was subject to the community's approval. The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their <b>own</b> <b>culture</b> to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture, particularly with the introduction of Christianity. However, Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples. More recently American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.|$|E

5|$|Roman {{religious}} beliefs {{date back to}} the founding of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with Greek culture, and adopted many of the Greek {{religious beliefs}}. Private and personal worship was an important aspect of religious practices. In a sense, each household was a temple to the gods. Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their <b>own</b> <b>culture,</b> as well as other philosophical traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{is remembered}} in the CIA {{as its first}} {{successful}} Director of Central Intelligence, {{and one of its}} most effective, who redefined its structure and mission. The CIA's expansive covert action program remained the responsibility of Frank Wisner's quasi-independent Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), but Smith began to bring OPC under the DCI's control. In early January 1951 he made Allen Dulles the first Deputy Director for Plans (DDP), to supervise both OPC and the CIA's separate espionage organization, the Office of Special Operations (OSO). Not until January 1952 were all intelligence functions consolidated under a Deputy Director for Intelligence (DDI). Wisner succeeded Dulles as DDP in August 1951, and it took until August 1952 to merge the OSO and the OPC, each of which had its <b>own</b> <b>culture,</b> methods, and pay scales, into an effective, single directorate.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic concept}} of SaGa Frontier {{is based on}} its Free Scenario System, in which one can play as any of seven {{different}} protagonists, all of whom exist in the same setting: a solar system known as The Regions, a group of planets, each with its <b>own</b> <b>culture,</b> game-level of technology, and form of magic. The game is considered non-linear, in that from the beginning many of the characters are free to go almost anywhere and interact with almost anyone. Travel {{through most of the}} Regions is easy due to inter-regional ships traveling regularly between them. The player controls the protagonist on the field screen, a set of interconnecting pre-rendered backgrounds, and is able to speak with a slew of other characters in order to gather information, recruit party members, and initiate quests. Each character has his or her own storyline and a main quest to fulfill, but there are also several optional quests that any of the characters can participate in. Some of the main characters even encounter each other during their quests. The storyline of each character also changes depending on who is chosen, what is said in conversation, what events have already occurred, and who the protagonist has in his or her party, a concept first introduced in Romancing SaGa 2.|$|E
