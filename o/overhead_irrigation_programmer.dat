40|$|The {{effects of}} {{irrigation}} methods on several bedding plants without polyethylene pots using compacted polyester fiber medium hardened by heat fusion were investigated. The characteristics of <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> {{with a tray}} collecting runoff water (combination of <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation) were investigated at the same time. Irrigation usage (the amount of water supplied per pot / amount of irrigation water) {{with a combination of}} <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation was improved compared to <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> alone. The growth of garden type Cyclamen grown under a combination of both <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation was significantly greater than that grown in either wick irrigation, ebb & flow <b>irrigation</b> or <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Notably, smaller growth was achiered in garden type cyclamen grown with <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation.</b> The growth of Vinca grown in a combination of <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation was significantly greater than that grown with <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> alone. The irrigation amount had no effect on the growth of Vinca regardless of irrigation method. The growth of Petunia was greater with increased amounts of irrigation water. However, the growth of Pansy grown under <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> was significantly greater than that grown in a combination of <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation. These results suggest that a combination of <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation method in bedding plant production without polyethylene pots is generally suitable since the plants grow without drought stress. However, it may be suggested that the amount of irrigation water should be as low as possible in the winter season or with sensitive species in order to prevent waterlogging injury. 熱融着性ポリエステル繊維固化培地を利用したポットレス花壇苗生産における灌水方法として，水受けトレイを用いた頭上灌水（頭上底面灌水）の実用性を検討した．頭上灌水と比較して頭上底面灌水では灌水効率（培地に吸収された灌水量／灌水量）が大幅に改善できた．ガーデンシクラメンの生育は頭上底面灌水区で最もよく，次いでひも灌水，底面灌水の順であり，頭上灌水区で最も生育が抑制された．ニチニチソウでは頭上灌水より頭上底面灌水区で生育が改善されたが，灌水量には差はほとんどみられなかった．ペチュニアでは灌水量が多いほど，専用トレイに溜める水量が多いほど生育が旺盛になった．しかし，パンジーでは頭上底面灌水によって生育が抑制された．ポットレス花壇苗生産では頭上底面灌水が最も適切であったが，蒸発散の少ない冬期や過湿に弱い種においては灌水量をできるだけ少なくすべきと考えられた...|$|R

40|$|Water quality {{remains a}} {{predominant}} issue within the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and nutrient loading continues {{to undermine the}} progressive recovery of this ecosystem. Until recently, the ornamental plant industry has had little information to develop better management practices {{to increase the efficiency}} of water and nutrient applications. This research used an integrated approach to examine container- production systems, to develop recommendations to increase nutrient uptake efficiency and reduce runoff. A 40 -month field study examined the effects of various cultural practices on irrigation and nutrient uptake efficiencies. Under cyclic scheduling, drip irrigation applied 3 to 4. 5 times less water than <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> and had significantly less runoff when plants were spaced at low densities. While drip irrigation is significantly more efficient, <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> is more practical and economically feasible for most small container-nursery stock. Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) was examined as an alternative to cyclic scheduling and when used with <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation,</b> water applications were half that of cyclic irrigation scheduling.. This research simultaneously documented nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics by examining nutrient applications, uptake and leaching over the forty months. In most cases, N and P uptake efficiency and runoff was negatively affected by <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation,</b> particularly when soluble nutrients were applied via fertigation and at low plant densities. Nitrogen and P efficiencies ranged between 10 and 30 % and were dependent upon methods of irrigation and fertilization, plant density and water use. The use of both drip and TDR-scheduled <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> reduced nutrient runoff to half that of the <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> program Intensive spring nutrient uptake studies showed that N influences the total growth of Rhododendron (azalea) and P uptake is a function of P fertilization rate and growth, influenced by N rate. Moderate N rates maintained optimal growth, while total P was only required at 1 / 20 of this N rate. Periodicity in nutrient uptake suggests seasonal timing of fertilizers may increase N and P uptake efficiency. Novel management strategies in the area of irrigation, fertilization, and cultural practices should be adopted by the ornamental industry to improve upon low efficiencies and reduce nutrient pollution in our watersheds...|$|R

To develop bedding plant production system without PP, properties of compacted medium hardened by heat fusion polyester fiber were investigated. Effects of irrigation methods {{on the growth}} of vegetative propagated petunia grown in medium without PP were investigated. The effect of medium type was not as significant as the difference in water loss per pot. Water loss per pot of medium without PP was about two times greater than medium held in PP. No compacted medium disintegrated easily without root-ball formation, and in 20 days after cutting about half of non-compacted medium had disintegrated. Compacted medium did not disintegrate before rooting. Medium type did not significantly affect rooting rates, plant heights, leaf numbers and fresh weights when transplanted to medium. Also, cell or pot medium type did not significantly affect plant heights, flower numbers, leaf numbers and fresh weights. Non-compacted medium without PP easily disintegrated with <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Subirrigation and much <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> had similar effect on growth when planted in containers.

These effects may help treated plants {{to survive a}} transplant shock. Under mild water stress, ProCa caused a transient reduction in leaf stomatal conductance (gs) in 'Camarosa' and 'Sweet Charlie' plants. This reduction in gs was paralleled by a decrease in transpiration in treated plants, which was not attributable to differences in plant size or leaf area. Pressure volume curves of 'Sweet Charlie' plants revealed that ProCa application lowered leaf osmotic potential at both full and zero turgor, and increased the volumetric modulus of elasticity.

In addition to dispersing bacterial cells and helping them to reach healthy plants as the key factor, and promoting release of leaf nutrients to the microbial community, <b>overhead</b> sprinkler <b>irrigation</b> can generate a film of water over the leaf surface including stomata, providing the symptomless epiphytic populations with a bridge to enter the plant resulting in disease symptoms development (Carvalho et al. 2011).

The aim {{of this research was}} to determine whether growth control of hardy nursery stock is possible using deficit irrigation applied with conventional <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Over two years, crop growth under an <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> system was compared under full irrigation and two severities of deficit irrigation. Initially, two crops of contrasting canopy structure i. e. Cornus alba and Lonicera periclymenum were grown.

Deficit irrigation was found to be highly effective in controlling vegetative growth when applied using <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> - with similar results as when drip irrigation was used. This comparable response suggests that deficit irrigation can be applied without precision drip irrigation. Scheduling two very different crops with respect to their water use and uptake potential, however, highlighted challenges with respect to application of appropriate deficits for very different crops under one system; responses to deficit irrigation will be more consistent where nursery management allows for scheduling of crops with very different architecture and water use under different regimes. The effectiveness of deficit irrigation in controlling the growth of Forsythia was similar when a reduced peat based substrate was compared with pure peat; additionally, flowering was enhanced...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to discuss {{certain aspects of}} irrigation {{on the basis of}} limited information which has been gained at Tongaat during the past few years. The ideas put forward mayor may not be agreed with, but if they stimulate interest and discussion on the numerous problems and unknowns, which arise from the application of water to sugar cane, then this paper has served its purpose. The word irrigation has come to mean the controlled application of water to the land, that is, specific quantities of water at planned times, and any application of water which falls short of these objectives requires another word to describe it. There are two methods 'of irrigation-surface or furrow <b>irrigation</b> and <b>overhead,</b> spray or sprinkler irrigation. It is important to realise that either can be the right way to irrigate. Where the land is gently sloping and water abundant and cheap, furrow irrigation must be considered first and foremost. When the terrain is difficult and, in particuJlar, water scarce or expensive, then <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> comes into its own. It is for precisely these reasons that <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> has been developed at Tongaat. Although the following conclusions relate to <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation,</b> the principles involved apply equally well to furrow irrigation governed only by the practical difficulties of applying precise quantities of water at each application.

The reason for the higher correlation coefficient with the <b>overhead</b> sprinkler <b>irrigation</b> system can {{be due to the}} effect of this type of irrigation on bacterial penetration to interior leaf spaces and subsequent development of disease. Similar results have been reported by other studies on the effect of windblown rain fall (Gilbertson and Maxwell 1992). Significant positive correlations between bacterial populations and disease severity have also been shown in other studies. For example, the epiphytic population of X. campestris pv. vesicatoria, the causal agent of tomato bacterial spot, was positively correlated with plant defoliation as a result of disease development (McGuire et al. 1991). Previously, Lindemann et al. (1984) also showed that the severity of brown spot of bean was correlated more consistently with epiphytic Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae population sizes than with disease incidence. A significant (P< 0.05) negative correlation between disease severity and seed yield per plant for both the furrow irrigated field (r=- 0.59) and the overhead sprinkler irrigated field (r=- 0.68) has also been reported (Akhavan et al. 2009 a). Furthermore, in both systems, there was a significant (P< 0.05) negative correlation between disease severity and total seed yield, but the coefficient correlation was higher under <b>overhead</b> sprinkler <b>irrigation</b> (r=- 0.83) compared to furrow irrigation (r=- 0.66). This difference is likely due to more severe disease in the field under <b>overhead</b> sprinkler <b>irrigation</b> system. Since the only difference between the two fields was the type of irrigation method, it can be interpreted that the overhead sprinkler system provided several factors that encouraged epiphytic populations to increase and to establish an endophytic population of Xap. <b>Overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> can provide an ideal multiplication site, i.e. a thin layer or film of water on the bean leaf surface, while also disseminating the pathogen from diseased to healthy plants. <b>Overhead</b> sprinkler <b>irrigation</b> may also help the epiphytic population of Xap to establish an aggressive endophytic population by facilitating the entry of bacterial cells through leaf openings followed by symptom development.|$|R

50|$|Wind {{and water}} {{movement}} easily disperses spores of Pestalotiopsis palmarum so sanitation and irrigation management can be {{proven to be}} critical in preventing {{the movement of the}} disease. Wounds and damage to the plant offer easy access for the fungus so the limitation of human and insect activity can be very beneficial. Limiting the length of time that the leaves are wet when exposed to high humidity levels also reduces the risk of inoculation. So eliminating <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> can prevent infection on leaves when there is favorable humid weather. Nutrient management is also very important in controlling Pestalotopsis palmarum. Nutrient deficiencies can cause chlorosis and necrosis of leaf tissue which then in turn creates a wound necessary for disease inoculation.|$|R
40|$|Bacterial midrib rot, {{caused by}} Pseudomonas cichorii, {{has become a}} serious threat to the {{production}} of greenhouse butterhead lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. capitata) in Belgium. Currently, there are no strategies for controlling this pathogen. Therefore, greenhouse experiments were conducted to obtain more knowledge about the epidemiology of P. cichorii on butterhead lettuce. Greenhouse butterhead lettuce becomes susceptible to lettuce midrib rot infections at head formation, and a single <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> with water containing 102 CFU/ml P. cichorii was sufficient to cause disease. The use of surface drip <b>irrigation</b> instead of <b>overhead</b> sprinkler <b>irrigation</b> significantly reduced midrib rot incidence in the greenhouse. P. cichorii isolates can be divided into subgroups based on BOX-PCR genomic fingerprinting, with isolates belonging to subgroup C 1 and C 2 being more virulent than those of (or related to) subgroup C 3. P. cichorii infections with distinct symptoms comparable to midrib rot have also been observed on field-grown crisphead lettuce in California and Japan which, respectively, are referred to as 'varnish spot' or 'tar'. We showed that symptom expression is strongly influenced by the lettuce cultivar group, irrespective of the P. cichorii isolate, resulting in varnish spot/tar on crisphead lettuce and midrib rot on butterhead or cutting group lettuce...|$|R
30|$|An {{integrated}} {{disease management}} {{is the most}} effective way of avoiding P. obscurans infection (Elmer 1990; Louws 2007; Ellis and Nita 2018). Admittedly, preventive measures are major approaches for the disease management wherein agricultural practices rank high among the disease control measures. In this vein, the use of certified disease-free plants, clearing the field of old plant debris from previous plants because overwintered fungus is commonly found in these debris and can easily lead to a new fungal inoculum, selecting a field with excellent soil drainage and good air circulation by allowing enough space between plants, applying <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation</b> in the early morning to speed up the drying of leaves during the day to prevent the growth of pathogens, and control of weeds which may favor an environment for pathogen growth.|$|R
40|$|Trifluralin is {{a general}} use {{pesticide}} (GUP) used to control many annual grasses and broadleaf weeds in a large variety of tree fruit, vegetable and grain crops. The compound {{may be found in}} formulations with other herbicides. Trifluralin is a selective, pre-emergence dinitroaniline herbicide that should be incorporated into the soil by mechanical means within 24 hours of application. Pre-emergence herbicides are applied before weed seedlings sprout. Granular formulations may be incorporated by <b>overhead</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Trifluralin available in granular and emulsifiable concentrate. The emulsifiable concentrate is about 45 percent pure. Products containing trifluralin bear the signal word, “Caution ” or “Warning” depending on the formulation. Trifluralin is classified toxicity class III. Trifluralin is a dinitroaniline compound. Trifluralin is labeled for use on many crops in Washington State – see table...|$|R
