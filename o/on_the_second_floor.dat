5|$|The kitchen, oratory {{and great}} chamber rose two floors, {{therefore}} only the minstrels' gallery was accessed via the main staircase <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor.</b> However, the butlery and pantry was single-storeyed, but held the butler's chamber (with a garderobe) above it, accessed either via a staircase {{in that room}} or via the gallery.|$|E

5000|$|The book Yōkaigadan Zenshū Nihonhen Jō (妖怪画談全集 日本編 上, [...] "Complete Analysis of Yōkai Paintings, Volume Japan, First Part") by the folklorist Morihiko Fujisawa {{gives the}} {{explanation}} {{that in the}} story from the Wakayama Prefecture called Takanyōbō (高女房, [...] "Tall Woman"), a takaonna would cause frights <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floors</b> of girō (brothels). Also, in the book Tōhoku Kaidan no Tabi (Travels for Mysterious Tales of Tōhoku) by the novelist Norio Yamada, the kaidan (mysterious tale) titled [...] "Takaonna" [...] presents the takaonna as one that peeks peek into <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> house, as a deeply jealous and ugly woman who could not get with any man, so they would walk around peeking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floors</b> of brothels. Due to this, much yōkai-related literature from the post-war period would also state that the takaonna is an ugly woman unable to get with any man who would mutate and become a monster and then peek into <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>floor</b> of brothels to menace people, but the yōkai resesarcher Kenji Murakami points out that Fujisawa's explanation {{is nothing more than}} a mere imagined interpretation of Sekien's painting and that Yamada's mysterious tale is a completely different tale that simply put under the title of being a takaonna.|$|R
