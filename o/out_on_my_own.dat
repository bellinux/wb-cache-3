25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E
500|$|The Daily Star quoted Rowland on {{the theme}} of the song. She said [...] "I hope to see women singing the song like they're in charge. It's {{important}} to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny." [...] Love explained to Rap-Up magazine his view of the song, [...] "It's just such an aggressive record, it's a club record, it's a worldwide international record. She's stretching her legs out and she's showing her true vocal ability, she's like the queen of the night on this record." [...] Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said [...] "I feel like I've finally come into my own," [...] a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound. [...] "With the sound of dance music getting embraced more, I'm very excited, seeing how fans have been responding to the music. Dance music is more of a European thing, but I've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans (in different parts of the country) talking about playing 'Commander'." [...] She said working with Guetta was [...] "amazing" [...] because it is [...] "effortless" [...] and she feels a great sense of [...] "chemistry" [...] when working with him. Rowland felt she was trying something different: [...] "In this generation and this day and time, no one is putting soul in dance music... no pop artist. I thought maybe that was something I could try. And then it works." [...] In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material but still fun. [...] "I just thought it'd be so much fun to be a commander of course. It's just a statement for me definitely, coming <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>own,</b> filling my space.

[...] Trainor said it took little time to craft the song with producer Ricky Reed, explaining: [...] "I told my producer we needed a big eff-you song, an anthem about girl power that sounded like nothing on the album.

As, besides the two new Zosterops, several of the 87 or 88 collected species are new for Liberia, and others being rare or of some interest in another way, I consider it sufficiently important to bring forward a full list of them, the more so as Mr. Demery, in January last, has left Liberia for the Sulymah River in the British Colony of Sierra Leone.

60|$|She withdrew her hand, yet left a {{lingering}} pressure, which I felt long afterwards. So intimately connected as I {{had been with}} perhaps {{the only man in}} whom she was ever truly interested, Zenobia looked on me as the representative of all the past, and was conscious that, in bidding me adieu, she likewise took final leave of Hollingsworth, and of this whole epoch of her life. Never did her beauty shine out more lustrously than in the last glimpse that I had of her. She departed, and was soon hidden among the trees. But, whether it was the strong impression of the foregoing scene, or whatever else the cause, I was affected with a fantasy that Zenobia had not actually gone, but was still hovering about the spot and haunting it. I seemed to feel her eyes upon me. It was as if the vivid coloring of her character had left a brilliant stain upon the air. By degrees, however, the impression grew less distinct. I flung myself upon the fallen leaves at the base of Eliot's pulpit. The sunshine withdrew up the tree trunks and flickered on the topmost boughs; gray twilight made the wood obscure; the stars brightened out; the pendent boughs became wet with chill autumnal dews. But I was listless, worn <b>out</b> with emotion <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> behalf and sympathy for others, and had no heart to leave my comfortless lair beneath the rock.|$|R
60|$|Lest any man think I {{mean to be}} ill-natured when I {{talk about}} our pilgrims as I have been talking, I wish to say in all sincerity that I do not. I would not listen to lectures from men I did not like and could not respect; and none of these can say I ever took their lectures unkindly, or was restive under the infliction, or failed to try to profit by what they said to me. They are better men than I am; I can say that honestly; they are good friends of mine, too--and besides, {{if they did not}} wish to be stirred up {{occasionally}} in print, why in the mischief did they travel with me? They knew me. They knew my liberal way--that I like to give and take--when it is for me to give and other people to take. When one of them threatened to leave me in Damascus when I had the cholera, he had no real idea of doing it--I know his passionate nature and the good impulses that underlie it. And did I not overhear Church, another pilgrim, say he did not care who went or who staid, he would stand by me till I walked <b>out</b> of Damascus <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> feet or was carried out in a coffin, if it was a year?

40|$|This {{study was}} borne <b>out</b> of {{reflection}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> journey of English language learning. My knowledge of English {{has been built}} through my ‘lived-experiences’ of academic and social discourses that I encountered as a postgraduate student learning and living, in English, in Australia. I decided I {{wanted to be able}} to use my experiences almost as a touchstone for an investigation of the experiences of others like me. In order to do this, this study has been constructed, and is presented, so that the experiences of the researcher - me - run parallel to those of others who are like me. The study investigates how the knowledge and experiences of English language learning, that Asian students bring with them to Australia, impact academic engagement and second language socialisation. It also examines how the use of explicit instruction in language learning skills and strategies (LLS) influences continued language development, academic engagement and fuller socialisation within the Australian community. This research is a qualitative case study. The methodology of the study is informed by a number of theoretical perspectives including phenomenology and ethnomethodology as well as by the principles of designed based research. The study also draws on the work of Michael Agar (1994; 2006) to provide a framework for how Asian students adapt to their new environment. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews conducted before and after a language learning strategy training program. Data were also gathered through the application and analysis of a strategy checklist and through the use of an online survey. There were eight principal participants in the study. Their accounts of their experiences provide rich and detailed information about their language learning, about academic discourse socialisation and about socialisation more generally. Survey data suggest that the experiences of the principal participants resonate more broadly within the Asian student population of the university where this study was conducted. The findings of the study identify areas of difficulty for the participants and evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy program in supporting students to overcome these difficulties. The study reveals that strategy training can be assistive but that other factors, such as language proficiency and educational experiences both in home country contexts and in Australia, can impact strategy training effectiveness. These other factors are widely reported in the Australian literature (e. g. Betty Leask; Erlenawati Sawir; Helen Benzie; Simone Volet). What is different about this study is that, through the utilisation of a range of theoretical perspectives to inform and enact strategy training and use, a new theoretically cohesive model has been developed that can be assistive in addressing issues associated with both academic discourse socialisation and second language (L 2) socialisation more generally. The study also provides recommendations for institutions and advice for students to better support Asian students, like me, who choose to study in Australia...|$|R
