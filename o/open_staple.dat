5000|$|Goldenvoice {{reserved}} tentative {{dates for}} October 2000 to reprise the festival, but ultimately canceled for that year; Tollett {{blamed it on}} the oversaturation of music festivals in Southern California. The electronic dance music festival Nocturnal Wonderland filled the void at the Empire Polo Club, taking place in September 2000. Goldenvoice opted to bring Coachella back in April 2001 {{in an attempt to}} beat the heat. Ticket prices were raised to $65. Organizers encountered difficulty booking acts for the festival and due to [...] "available talent", were forced to shorten the festival to a single day. Issues with securing a headliner threatened to doom the event until Perry Farrell agreed to bring his reunited group Jane's Addiction to the proceedings. Amidst financial concerns, Tollett agreed to sell Goldenvoice to Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) in March 2001 for $7 million. AEG, which had <b>opened</b> <b>Staples</b> Center in Los Angeles two years prior, purchased the promoter to help them find shows to book. The corporation wanted Tollett to continue staging Coachella, understanding that it initially would lose money; Tollett initially retained full control of Coachella {{as a result of the}} acquisition. Like its predecessor, the 2001 festival went smoothly; over 35,000 tickets were sold, and despite taking a loss again, Tollett estimates it was a [...] "low, low six-figure sum".|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} {{consecutive}} series of 31 patients who underwent endoscopic stapled diverticulotomy. The patients' notes were reviewed retrospectively {{to gather data}} on their original admission and a postal survey was conducted to establish patient satisfaction, their ability to swallow and re-operation data. Three patients were lost to follow-up. Nine of the remaining 28 died at a median of 18 months. The remaining 21 were followed up for a median of 59 months. The data showed that, at 5 years, 94. 4 % of patients had an improvement in their swallowing, and 50 % had an entirely normal swallow. In order to achieve this result, 19 % of patients required a second procedure, and one patient (3. 2 %) required a third (<b>open)</b> procedure. Endoscopic <b>stapled</b> diverticulotomy has well-established, short-term advantages. This series shows {{that it has a}} good long-term outcome that is similar to established open techniques and probably better than other techniques of endoscopic diverticulotomy, i. e. diathermy or laser...|$|R
40|$|Background Anastomotic leak (AL) after {{gastrointestinal}} {{surgery is}} a severe complication associated with relevant short- and long-term sequelae. Most of the anastomosis are currently performed with a surgical stapler {{that is required}} to have appropriate characteristics to guarantee good performances. The aim of our study was to evaluate, in the laboratory, pressure resistance and tensile strength of anastomosis performed with different surgical linear staplers, available in the market. Materials and methods We have been studying three linear staplers, with diverse cartridges and staple heights, of three different companies, used for gastrointestinal anastomosis and gastric or intestinal closure. We performed 50 anastomosis for each device, with the pertinent different cartridges, on fresh pig intestine, {{for a total of}} 350 anastomosis, then injected saline solution and recorded the pressure that provokes a leak on the staple line. There were no statistically significant differences between the mean pressure necessary to induce an AL in the various instruments (P > 0. 05). For studying the tensile strength, we performed a total of 350 anastomosis with the different linear staplers on a special strong paper (Tyvek), then recorded the maximal tensile force that could open the anastomosis. Results There were no statistically significant differences between the different staplers about the strength necessary to <b>open</b> the <b>staple</b> line (P > 0. 05). Conclusions we demonstrated that different linear staplers of three companies available in the market give comparable anastomotic pressure resistance and tensile strength. This might suggest that small dissimilarities between different devices are not involved, at least as major parameters, in AL etiology...|$|R
40|$|Background: Haemorrhoidal disease, one of {{the most}} common {{anorectal}} disorders, when complicated, is a painful concern to the patient. Miligan Morgan haemorrhoidectomy is a commonly performed gold standard procedure for haemorrhoids with good results but is a very painful procedure. Stapled haemorrhoidopexy has emerged as a possible alternative promising lesser immediate post operative complications. Methods: Sixty patients between age group of 20 - 70 years with symptomatic haemorrhoidal disease planned for surgical technique were randomized into two groups: A stapled haemorrhoidopexy(SH) group operated on using PPH 03 kit and a Miligan Morgan (MM) group operated on using a standard open haemorrhoidectomy technique. Results: The mean operative time, average pain scores and consequent parenteral and oral analgesics requirement was significantly lower in stapled group. There was no significant difference in immediate complications between the two groups. Duration of hospital stay was significantly lower in SH group and they returned to work significantly earlier and were more satisfied than the <b>open</b> group. Conclusion: <b>Stapled</b> haemorrhoidopexy is an effective procedure for haemorrhoids with minimal immediate complications but the cost is exorbitant...|$|R
