5|$|Okra seed oil, from Abelmoschus esculentus. Composed {{predominantly}} of <b>oleic</b> and linoleic acids. The greenish yellow {{edible oil}} has a pleasant taste and odor.|$|E
5|$|Persimmon seed oil, {{extracted}} from the seeds of Diospyros virginiana. Dark, reddish-brown color, similar in taste to olive oil. Nearly equal content of <b>oleic</b> and linoleic acids.|$|E
5|$|Tall oil, {{produced}} as {{a byproduct of}} wood pulp manufacture. A further byproduct called tall oil fatty acid (TOFA) is a cheap source of <b>oleic</b> acid.|$|E
5|$|Fruits are {{released}} in the summer, containing about 16 seeds on average. These seeds are most typically dispersed by ants, which is called myrmecochory, but yellow jackets (Vespula vulgaris) and harvestmen (order Opiliones) have both been observed dispersing the seeds at lower frequencies. Insect dispersal is aided {{by the presence of}} a conspicuous elaiosome, an oil-rich body attached to the seed, which is high in both lipids and <b>oleic</b> acid. The <b>oleic</b> acid induces corpse-carrying behavior in ants, causing them to bring the seeds to their nesting sites as if they were food. As ants visit several colonies of the plant, they bring genetically variable seeds back to a single location, which after germination results in a new population with relatively high genetic diversity. This has the ultimate effect of increasing biological fitness.|$|E
5|$|Passiflora edulis Passion fruit oil is {{extracted}} from the seeds and composed mainly of linoleic acid (62%) with smaller amounts of <b>oleic</b> acid (20%) and palmitic acid (7%). It has varied applications in cosmetics manufacturing and for uses as a human or animal food.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Geastrum triplex have been {{chemically}} analyzed and shown {{to contain a}} number of bioactive compounds, including fungal sterols such as ergosta-4,6,8,(14),22-tetraen-3-one,5,6-dihydroergosterol, ergosterol, and peroxyergosterol. The fungus also contains various fatty acids, notably myristic, palmitic, stearic, <b>oleic,</b> alpha-linolenic, and linoeic acid.|$|E
5|$|The total lipid, or crude fat, content {{makes up}} 2.6% {{of the dry}} matter of the mushroom. The {{proportion}} of fatty acids (expressed as a % of total fatty acids) are: palmitic acid, 9.8%; stearic acid, 2.7%; <b>oleic</b> acid, 36.1%; linoleic acid, 42.2%, and linolenic acid, 0.2%.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of fresh fruit bodies collected in Mexico {{showed them to}} have the following composition: moisture 94.53%; ash 0.323%; dietary fiber 3.024%; fat 0.368%; and protein 1.581%. The free fatty acid content of dried fruit bodies was 4.5%, slightly more than the common button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), which had 3.5%. The majority of this total was <b>oleic</b> acid (1.95%), followed by linoleic acid (1.68%) and palmitic acid (1.69%).|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{analysis}} shows R.botrytis {{to have a}} food energy value of 154 kilojoules per 100 grams of fresh fruit bodies, which {{is comparable to the}} 120–150 kJ range reported for commercially grown edible mushrooms. As a percentage of dry matter, the fruit bodies contain 39.0% crude protein, 1.4% lipids, 50.8% carbohydrates, and 8.8% ash. The majority of the lipid content comprises <b>oleic</b> (43.9%), linoleic (38.3%), and palmitic (9.9%) fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of S.brevipes fruit bodies has been analyzed. The cap contained a higher lipid content than the stipe—18.4% {{of the dry}} weight, compared to 12.4%. In the cap, linoleic acid made up 50.7% of the total lipids (65.7% in the stipe), <b>oleic</b> acid was 29.9% (12.4% in the stipe), followed by palmitic acid at 10.5% (12.6% in the stipe). Linoleic acid—a {{member of the group}} of essential fatty acids called omega-6 fatty acids—is an essential dietary requirement for humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a double bond is {{introduced into the}} fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of stearic acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces <b>oleic</b> acid. The doubly unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid {{as well as the}} triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E
5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% <b>oleic</b> acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, <b>oleic</b> and linolenic acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant. Varying amounts of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc were present.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volatile flavour compounds of Suillellus luridus consists largely of linoleic acid, with smaller proportions of 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid methyl ester, and heptadecanoic acid. Pyrazine compounds might {{be responsible for the}} characteristic odour of the dried mushroom. The predominant sterol present in the fruit bodies is ergosterol, with smaller amounts of closely related derivative compounds. The main fatty acids of the mushroom include linoleic acid (53.4% of total fatty acids), <b>oleic</b> acid (24.1%), and palmitic acid (10.2%). Arginine is the free amino acid found in the highest concentration (96.9μM per gram of dry weight), followed by glutamine (9.7) and alanine (8.2).|$|E
25|$|Typical {{total fat}} {{composition}} is roughly: 1%ω-3, 14%ω-6, 71%ω-9 (65% <b>oleic</b> and 6% palmitoleic), and 14% saturated fat (palmitic acid).|$|E
25|$|About 75% of an avocado's energy {{comes from}} fat, {{most of which}} (67% of total fat) is {{monounsaturated}} fat as <b>oleic</b> acid.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in 2001 found higher levels of monounsaturated fatty acids MUFAs (especially <b>oleic</b> acid) in the erythrocyte membranes of postmenopausal women who developed breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 73% of {{the energy}} in hemp seeds {{is in the form}} of fats and {{essential}} fatty acids, mainly polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic, <b>oleic</b> and alpha-linolenic acids.|$|E
25|$|Walnut oil is {{composed}} mostly of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid, although it also contains <b>oleic</b> acid, a monounsaturated fat and 31% of total fat is saturated fat.|$|E
25|$|An isotope {{labeling}} {{study in}} humans {{concluded that the}} fraction of dietary stearic acid that oxidatively desaturates to <b>oleic</b> acid is 2.4 {{times higher than the}} fraction of palmitic acid analogously converted to palmitoleic acid.|$|E
25|$|Erucic acid is {{produced}} by elongation of <b>oleic</b> acid via oleoyl-coenzyme A and malonyl-CoA. Erucic acid is broken down into shorter-chain fatty acids in the human liver by the long-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase enzyme.|$|E
25|$|Both crunchy/chunky {{and smooth}} peanut butter are sources of {{saturated}} (primarily palmitic acid, 21% of total fat) and monounsaturated fats, mainly <b>oleic</b> acid as 47% of total fat, and polyunsaturated fat (28% of total fat), primarily as linoleic acid).|$|E
25|$|Older {{literature}} {{cites the}} fungus Malassezia furfur (previously known as Pityrosporum ovale) {{as the cause}} of dandruff. While this species does occur naturally on the skin surface of both healthy people and those with dandruff, in 2007 it was discovered that the responsible agent is a scalp specific fungus, Malassezia globosa, that metabolizes triglycerides present in sebum by the expression of lipase, resulting in a lipid byproduct <b>oleic</b> acid. During dandruff, the levels of Malassezia increase by 1.5 to 2 times its normal level. <b>Oleic</b> acid penetrates the top layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum, and evokes an inflammatory response in susceptible people which disturbs homeostasis and results in erratic cleavage of stratum corneum cells.|$|E
25|$|Grape {{seed oil}} from crushed seeds {{is used in}} cosmeceuticals and skincare {{products}} for perceived health benefits. Grape seed oil contains tocopherols (vitamin E) and high contents of phytosterols and polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid, <b>oleic</b> acid, and alpha-linolenic acid.|$|E
25|$|The cypselas contain almost 7% <b>oleic</b> {{acid and}} 12½% {{linoleic}} acid, making the oil comparable to soybean, corn, sunflower and sesame oils. Commercial use would {{be dependent on}} plant breeding to improve crop yield, suitability for harvesting and for food processing, such as selection of spineless plants.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the major fatty acid components, palmitic acid, <b>oleic</b> acid and linoleic acid, C.cristata contains two unusual fatty acids, cis-9, cis-14-octadecadien-12-ynoic acid, and the conjugated cis-9, trans-11, trans-13, cis-15-octadecatetraenoic acid (commonly known as α-parinaric acid). C.cristata is the only fungi known to contain α-parinaric acid.|$|E
25|$|Other {{possible}} fat taste receptors {{have been}} identified. G protein-coupled receptors GPR120 and GPR40 {{have been linked}} to fat taste, because their absence resulted in reduced preference to two types of fatty acid (linoleic acid and <b>oleic</b> acid), as well as decreased neuronal response to oral fatty acids.|$|E
25|$|Necrophoric {{behaviour}} {{occurs in}} the red imported fire ant. Workers discard uneaten food and other such wastes away from the nest. The active component was not identified, but the fatty acids accumulating {{as a result of}} decomposition were implicated and bits of paper coated with synthetic <b>oleic</b> acid typically elicited a necrophoric response. The process behind this behaviour in imported red fire ants was confirmed by Blum (1970): unsaturated fats, such as <b>oleic</b> acid, elicit corpse-removal behaviour. Workers also show differentiated responses towards dead workers and pupae. Dead workers are usually taken away from the nest, whereas the pupae may take a day for a necrophoric response to occur. Pupae infected by Metarhizium anisopliae are usually discarded by workers at a higher rate; 47.5% of unaffected corpses are discarded within a day, but for affected corpses this figure is 73.8%.|$|E
25|$|A 100 gram {{serving of}} milk {{chocolate}} supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% {{of the fat}} in milk chocolate is saturated, composed mainly of palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is <b>oleic</b> acid (table, see USDA reference for full report).|$|E
25|$|The trans {{fatty acid}} elaidic acid has {{different}} chemical and physical properties, owing to the slightly different bond configuration. It has a much higher melting point, 45°C, than <b>oleic</b> acid, 13.4°C, due {{to the ability of}} the trans molecules to pack more tightly, forming a solid that is more difficult to break apart. This notably means that it is a solid at human body temperatures.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a diacyl-glycerol shown on the right. This DAG is 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol, which {{contains}} side-chains derived from palmitic acid and <b>oleic</b> acid. Diacylglycerols can also have many other combinations of fatty acids attached at either the C-1 and C-2 positions or the C-1 and C-3 positions of the glycerol molecule. 1,2 disubstituted glycerols are always chiral, 1,3 disubstituted glycerols are chiral if the substituents are different from each other.|$|E
25|$|The genus is rich {{in organic}} acids {{including}} formic, butyric, linoleic, linolenic, malic, myristic, <b>oleic</b> and palmitic acids as well as phenolic compounds, and the amino acid α-alanine. Esters like ethyl butyrate, ethyl caproate, n-hexyl butyrate and n-hexyl caproate give the fruits their flavor and appetizing smell. Sugars, contained mainly in the fruit, are most significantly d-fructose, d-glucose and raffinose. Among enzymes, Passiflora {{was found to be}} rich in catalase, pectin methylesterase and phenolase.|$|E
25|$|Greenish-yellow edible okra oil {{is pressed}} from okra seeds; {{it has a}} {{pleasant}} taste and odor, and is high in unsaturated fats such as <b>oleic</b> acid and linoleic acid. The oil content of some varieties of the seed is about 40%. At 794kg/ha, the yield was exceeded only by that of sunflower oil in one trial. A 1920 study found that a sample contained 15% oil. A 2009 study found okra oil suitable {{for use as a}} biofuel.|$|E
25|$|Other skin {{damaging}} {{methods used}} to increase nanoparticle penetration include tape stripping, skin abrasion, and chemical enhancement. Tape stripping is the process in which tape is applied to skin then lifted to remove {{the top layer of}} skin. Skin abrasion is done by shaving the top 5-10 micrometers off the surface of the skin. Chemical enhancement is the process in which chemicals such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and <b>oleic</b> acid are applied {{to the surface of the}} skin to increase permeability.|$|E
25|$|Some alleles {{that vary}} in {{frequency}} between specific populations {{have been shown}} to be associated with differential responses to specific drugs. The beta blocker atenolol is an anti-hypertensive medication that is shown to more significantly lower the blood pressure of Caucasian patients than African American patients in the United States. This observation suggests that Caucasian and African American populations have different alleles governing <b>oleic</b> acid biochemistry, which react differentially with atenolol. Similarly, hypersensitivity to the antiretroviral drug abacavir is strongly associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism that varies in frequency between populations.|$|E
25|$|That {{same study}} {{discussed}} that a diet high in MUFAs {{is not the}} major determinant of erythrocyte membrane MUFAs, where most <b>oleic</b> acid in mammalian tissue {{is derived from the}} saturated stearic acid residue. Where key conversion is controlled by the Delta9-desaturase, which also regulates the transformation of the other common saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (myristic and palmitic). The study discussed that fat content of the diet has an important effect on Delta9-d activity, while high levels of SFAs increase Delta9-d activity by twofold to threefold, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) decrease.|$|E
