5|$|Membership {{peaked in}} the 1920s, {{but with the}} onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Depression</b> {{declined}} steadily, and by the 1970s the congregation {{could no longer afford}} to heat the sanctuary.

By 1937, tiring of life as an administrative clerk, Braham turned to the British armed forces for a more fulfilling career.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Depression</b> until the {{formation}} of the New Zealand Rabbit Board in 1954, rabbits became a major pest in the area, and rabbiters were employed to keep the creatures under control. The trapping of rabbits and auctioning of their skins in Dunedin became a minor but important part of the Catlins area's economy during this time.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Shepard {{accepted}} {{the position of}} pastor at Mount Olivet Tabernacle Baptist Church in West Philadelphia, where he would remain {{for the rest of}} his life.

Shepard's reputation as a minister grew, and he served as assistant secretary of the National Baptist Convention and associate editor of the National Baptist Voice.|$|E

When the provincial government proved resistant to adopting it, Aberhart resolved to field social credit candidates in the 1935 provincial election. These candidates won 56 of the province's 63seats, and Aberhart became Premier of Alberta.|$|E
5|$|No {{recession}} of the post-World War II era has come {{anywhere near the}} depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Depression.</b> In the Great Depression, GDP fell by 27% (the deepest after demobilization is the recession beginning in December 2007, during which GDP has fallen 5.1% as of {{the second quarter of}} 2009) and unemployment rate reached 10% (the highest since was the 10.8% rate reached during the 1981–82 recession).|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Alaska Railroad was completed in 1922, but by the 1930s, due to effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Depression,</b> freight traffic declined on the railroad.

The truckers rebelled at this, with some violent skirmishes. Pirate ferry operations were started, lasting until the start of World War II.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Carnivàle {{takes place in}} the mid-1930s during the worst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Depression,</b> a time of massive social and {{political}} upheaval. Unemployment rates were high, and European fascism was on the rise, in the years leading up to the Second World War. People in the Great Plains suffered from the effects of the Dust Bowl. Farmers often not only ran into debt and lost their properties but also risked their health; dust pneumonia was a common cause of death.|$|E
5|$|The {{story that}} the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore. Bradman's {{meteoric}} rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years.

5|$|U.S. President Herbert Hoover {{signed the}} Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act into law on June 17, 1930. The tariff's {{aim was to}} protect {{agriculture}} in the United States, but congressional representatives ultimately raised tariffs {{on a host of}} manufactured goods resulting in average duties as high as 53% on over a thousand various goods. Twenty-five trading partners responded in kind by introducing new tariffs {{on a wide range of}} U.S. goods. Hoover was pressured and compelled to adhere to the Republican Party's 1928 platform, which sought protective tariffs to alleviate market pressures on the nation's struggling agribusinesses and reduce the domestic unemployment rate. The culmination of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Depression</b> heightened fears, further pressuring Hoover to act on protective policies against the advice of Henry Ford and over 1,000 economists who protested by calling for a veto of the act. Exports from the United States plummeted 60% from 1930 to 1933. Worldwide international trade virtually ground to a halt. The international ramifications of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, comprising protectionist and discriminatory trade policies and bouts of economic nationalism, are credited by economists with prolongment and worldwide propagation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Depression.</b>|$|E

Born at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Depression,</b> Adkins' early life was stricken by poverty. His parents were unable to provide him shoes until he was four or five years old. Some reports say he attended school for a very brief time, as few as two days of first grade.|$|E
