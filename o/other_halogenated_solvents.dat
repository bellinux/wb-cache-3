The objective of the present work is to propose substitution solvent for the extraction of volatile compounds. The most important physico-chemical parameters in the choice of an appropriate extraction solvent of volatile compounds are reviewed. Various solvents are selected on this basis and on their hazard characteristics. The selected solvents, safer than dichloromethane, are compared using the extraction efficiency of volatile compounds from a model food product able to interact with volatile compounds. Volatile compounds with different hydrophobicity are used. High extraction yields were positively correlated with high boiling points and high Log Row values of volatile compounds. Mixtures of solvents such as azeotrope propan- 2 -one/cyclopentane, azeotrope ethyl acetate/ethanol, and mixture ethyl acetate/ethanol (3 : 1, v/v) gave higher extraction yields than those obtained with dichloromethane...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the present work concern {{the study of the}} complex {{formation}} between macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers, cryptand [2. 2. 2], crown ether derivatives, and cyclodextrin with charged or uncharged substrates in different media. This study is important {{from the point of view}} of understanding the mechanism of biological transport, molecular recognition, and enzyme specific binding activities as well as extraction abilities of crown ethers. During the extraction process, water molecules are coextracted with the metal ions, metal complexes, and anions into the water-saturated organic solvent used. Up to date, there is little knowledge about the influence of the water molecule upon these processes. First, the study of the complex formation between 18 C 6 and barium and ammonium perchlorate in mixtures of water-dioxan is performed by means of calorimetric titrations. The water-dioxan system allows a large range of dielectric permittivity. The stability constants and thermodynamic values for the formed complexes are determined. Since chloroform is used as solvent in extraction experiments, the complex formation of alkali metal cations and ammonium as dibenzyldithiocarbamate salts with crown ethers in chloroform is systematically investigated by means of calorimetric titrations. The most important problem in nonpolar solvent arises from the existence of ion pairs. In the case of ammonium salts, competitive measurements are carried out to underline the anion influence upon the complex formation. The influence of chloroform upon the complex formation between the crown ethers and cryptand [2. 2. 2], respectively, and the ammonium salts is observed by using in these experiments <b>other</b> <b>halogenated</b> <b>solvents,</b> e. g. dichloromethane, 1, 2 -dichloroetane. Further, the interest is focused on the interactions between small quantities of polar solvent (like water) and crown ethers in chloroform. These interactions are studied by calorimetric measurements. For a better understanding of the influence of chloroform upon the complexation between crown ethers and water, chloroform is replaced by: dichloromethane, 1, 2 -dichloroethane, and carbon tetrachloride. Since the hydrogen bonds are responsible for the complex formation between crown ethers and water in the halogenated solvents, further investigations have been performed by replacing water by methanol, acetone and acetonitrile. Once the impact of the polar solvents upon the solvation of the ligands in chloroform has been investigated, the focus of attention is laid on the reaction of crown ethers with cations in nonpolar medium with small amounts of polar solvents added. The aim is to get deeper insight into the solvation (hydration) of the salts. The experiments have been carried out by calorimetric titration. The interactions, the ligand nature, the concentrations of polar solvents, and the nature of nonpolar solvents involved in complexation have been analysed and discussed. In order to double check the results, a new set of experiments has been performed by spectrophotometric measurements. The stability constants of the complex formation between the two ligands one aza- 15 -crown- 5 derivative and one benzo- 15 -crown- 5 derivative, and alkali ions as dibenzyldithiocarbamate salts in chloroform are determined based on the spectral changes of the ligands in the presence of variable concentration of alkali metal cations in chloroform. The results are comparable with the ones obtained by calorimetric titrations. Further, the complex formation of α-cyclodextrin with uncharged guests, such as amides and nitriles, respectively, in aqueous solution has been investigated by calorimetric titration. The results demonstrate the influence of solvation changes during the complex formation of uncharged molecules with α-cyclodextrin...|$|E
40|$|The {{preparation}} and characterisation of [FeIII(sal 2 -trien) ][MnIICrIII(ox) 3]·CH 2 Cl 2 and [FeIII(sal 2 -trien) ][MnIICrIII(ox) 3]· 0. 75 CH 3 OH· 0. 5 H 2 O {{is presented in}} Chapter 2. The use of [FeIII(sal 2 -trien) ]+ leads, depending on the synthetic conditions, to two different structures. Compound [FeIII(sal 2 -trien) ][MnIICrIII(ox) 3]·CH 2 Cl 2 presents a 2 D network and shows coexistence of a complete spin-crossover and a ferromagnetic ordering from the bimetallic oxalate network around 5 K. The second compound, [FeIII(sal 2 -trien) ] [MnIICrIII(ox) 3]· 0. 75 CH 3 OH· 0. 5 H 2 O, with a 3 D achiral network, exhibits a partial spincrossover besides the ferromagnetic ordering. The formation of two different oxalate networks with the same templating cation is a very unusual fact {{for this type of}} compounds that we attribute to the flexibility of the organic ligands of [FeIII(sal 2 -trien) ]+ complex in the presence of different solvents. The photomagnetic properties of [FeIII(sal 2 -trien) ] [MnIICrIII(ox) 3]·CH 2 Cl 2 are studied in Chapter 3. This compound shows LIESST effect below 42 K. This is a very unusual result as this effect is rarely observed in FeIII complexes. In Chapter 4, the preparation of several analogs of [FeIII(sal 2 -trien) ] [MnIICrIII(ox) 3]·CH 2 Cl 2 in <b>other</b> <b>halogenated</b> <b>solvents</b> (CHCl 3, CH 2 Br 2 y CHBr 3) is described. The same 2 D structure is maintained in the compounds of formula [FeIII(sal 2 -trien) ] [MnIICrIII(ox) 3]·CH 2 Br 2, [FeIII(sal 2 -trien) ][MnIICrIII(ox) 3]·CHBr 3 and [FeIII(sal 2 -trien) ] [MnIICrIII(ox) 3]·CHCl 3. The change of CH 2 Cl 2 by bulkier solvents allows tuning T 1 / 2, which is shifted toward lower temperatures, and TLIESST, which is shifted towards higher values. The FeIII complexes of these compounds have been diluted with similar diamagnetic GaIII complexes. This has allowed to study the spin-crossover of the isolated FeIII complexes by spectroscopic methods in [Ga 0. 99 Fe 0. 01 (sal 2 -trien) ][MnIICrIII(ox) 3]·CH 2 Cl 2. This compound shows a thermal spin-crossover and LIESST effect as the FeIII pure compound. Finally, a structural analysis of these compounds and other FeIII ones described in the literature showing LIESST effect has been performed. In Chapter 5, 6 and 7 the search of other oxalate-based magnetic hybrids with derivatives of [FeIII(sal 2 -trien) ]+ complex has been continued. [FeIII(5 -NO 2 -sal 2 trien) ][MnIICrIII(ox) 3]·MeNO 2 · 0. 5 H 2 O and [FeIII(5 -CH 3 O-sal 2 trien) ][MnIICrIII(ox) 3] with 2 D and 3 D achiral structures, respectively, are presented in Chapter 5. The two compounds show a magnetic ordering around 5 K but they do not present spin-crossover. The syntheses, structure and magnetic properties of [FeIII(5 -Cl-sal 2 trien) ][MnIICrIII(ox) 3]· 0. 5 MeNO 2, [FeIII(5 -Br-sal 2 trien) ][MnIICrIII(ox) 3] and [InIII(5 -Cl-sal 2 trien) ][MnIICrIII(ox) 3] are shown in Chapter 6. They present a new chiral 3 D structure that affords a new property to the multifunctional system, chirality, besides magnetic ordering and spin-crossover in the FeIII compounds. Finally, derivatives of [FeIII(sal 2 -trien) ]+ with substituent in 3 or 4 positions lead to the compounds of formula [FeIII(4 -Br-sal 2 trien) ][MnIICrIII(ox) 3] 0. 67 ·Cl 0. 33 ·MeOH, [FeIII(3 -Cl-sal 2 trien) ][MnIICrIII(ox) 3]·(CH 3 OH) 2 ·(CH 3 CN) 2, [FeIII(3 -Br-sal 2 trien) ] [MnIICrIII(ox) 3]·(CH 3 CN) 2, and [FeIII(3 -MeO-sal 2 trien) ][MnIICrIII(ox) 3]·(CH 3 OH) ·(H 2 O) 1. 5 ·(CH 2 Cl 2) 0. 5 with 2 D structures. The magnetic ordering around 5 K of all of them coexists with a complete spin-crossover from 300 to 400 K for [FeIII(4 -Br-sal 2 trien) ] [MnIICrIII(ox) 3] 0. 67 ·Cl 0. 33 ·MeOH and partial spin-crossover for [FeIII(3 -Cl-sal 2 trien) ] [MnIICrIII(ox) 3]·(CH 3 OH) 2 ·(CH 3 CN) 2 and [FeIII(3 -Br-sal 2 trien) ][MnIICrIII(ox) 3]·(CH 3 CN) 2. FeIII complexes of [FeIII(3 -MeO-sal 2 trien) ][MnIICrIII(ox) 3]·(CH 3 OH) ·(H 2 O) 1. 5 ·(CH 2 Cl 2) 0. 5 are in the High-Spin state in all the range of temperature studied. The insertion of [MnIII(salen) ]+ complexes and derivatives into oxalate-based bimetallic networks has been studied in Chapters 8 and 9. These complexes give rise to a great variety of structures. The insertion of derivatives of [MnIII(salen) ]+ leads to the stabilization of MnIII monomers coordinated to the tetradentate Schiff base and two solvent molecules as shown in Chapter 8. Some of these compounds of formula [Mn((R) - salmen) (CH 3 OH) 2][MnCr(ox) 3](CH 2 Cl 2) 0. 375 ·(CH 3 OH) 0. 125 ·(H 2 O) 0. 375 and [Mn((S) - salmen) (CH 3 OH) 2][MnCr(ox) 3](CH 2 Cl 2) 0. 375 ·(CH 3 OH) 0. 375 ·(H 2 O) 0. 125 present 3 D achiral structures totally different to those obtained before. The compounds [Mn((R) - salmen) (CH 3 OH) (CH 3 CN) ][MnCr(ox) 3]·(CH 3 OH) 0. 5 ·(CH 3 CN) 1. 25 and [Mn((S) -salmen) (CH 3 OH) (CH 3 CN) ][MnCr(ox) 3]·(CH 3 OH) 0. 5 ·(CH 3 CN) 1. 25 with a chiral 2 D structure constitute the most promising result, as the they can be obtained enantiomerically pure. In contrast to its derivatives, [MnIII(salen) ]+ inserted into bimetallic networks maintains its dimeric structure in the compound [MnIII(salen) (H 2 O) ] 2 [MnIICrIII(ox) 3] 2 ·(MeOH) 3 ·(H 2 O) and the paramagnetic analog of formula [MnIII(salen) (H 2 O) ] 2 [ZnIICrIII(ox) 3] 2 ·(MeOH) 3 ·(H 2 O). They are formed by [MnIII(salen) (H 2 O) ] 2 2 + dimers inserted into an achiral 3 D network very similar to that obtained with [FeIII(sal 2 -trien) ]+, in Chapter 2. The preservation of the dimeric structure of MnIII precursor, allows a single molecule magnet (SMM) behavior in the ZnII paramagnetic compound although at very low temperatures (below 0. 5 K). Magnetic characterization of the ferromagnetic [MnIII(salen) (H 2 O) ] 2 [MnIICrIII(ox) 3] 2 ·(MeOH) 3 ·(H 2 O) compound is consistent with coexistence of magnetic ordering and a SMM behavior with important changes in the two properties due to the interaction between the bimetallic oxalate network and the SMMs...|$|E

If the cyclopropane is {{contaminated by}} diethyl malonate CH 2 (COOEt) 2, polymerization can be initiated by metallic sodium. The mechanism of this initiation {{was found to}} involve an initial reduction of the malonate by sodium to give the salt (EtOOC) 2 CH(-) Na(+) which acts as the real initiator. Poly(diethyl 1, 1 -cyclopropane dicarboxylate) is soluble in <b>halogenated</b> <b>solvents</b> and was characterized by GPC, IR, H- 1 - and C- 13 -NMR. Molecular weights are low to moderate (typically 10 (3) - 10 (4)) and are compatible with the low monomer / initiator ratios used in these experiments...|$|R
40|$|Substantial {{effort has}} been devoted to the {{synthesis}} of molecular receptors that can function as chemosensors for nitroaromatic explosives. In spite of several advantages, these receptors suffer from low sensitivity and difficulties translating the response into the gas phase. We have combined tetrathiafulvalene-functionalized calix[4]pyrrole, a colorimetric receptor, with a polyimide microcantilever, that includes a mechanical stress sensing element. The resulting system is capable of detecting 10 ppb trinitrobenzene vapor. This represents a 30 -fold improvement relative to the receptor in <b>halogenated</b> <b>solvents,</b> suggesting that this approach can provide a solution to translating the chemical response of colorimetric chemosensors into practical devices.
