5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the <b>oval</b> <b>window)</b> which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the <b>oval</b> <b>window.</b> Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the <b>oval</b> <b>window</b> causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|The three {{ossicles}} transmit {{sound from}} the outer ear to the inner ear. The malleus receives vibrations from sound pressure on the eardrum, where it is connected at its longest part (the manubrium or handle) by a ligament. It transmits vibrations to the incus, which in turn transmits the vibrations to the small stapes bone. The wide base of the stapes rests on the <b>oval</b> <b>window.</b> As the stapes vibrates, vibrations are transmitted through the <b>oval</b> <b>window,</b> causing movement of fluid within the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{between the}} incus {{and the inner}} ear, the stapes transmits sound {{vibrations}} from the incus to the <b>oval</b> <b>window,</b> a membrane-covered opening to the inner ear. The stapes is also stabilized by the stapedius muscle, which is innervated by the facial nerve.|$|E

Traces of the abbot's house were discovered during building works in 1989 and a small <b>oval</b> <b>window</b> was incorporated into the new building. Archaeological investigations have found graves with human remains, dating to the thirteenth to fifteenth century, and a medieval conduit, similar to one excavated at Saint Augustine's Abbey in Bristol.|$|E
5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the <b>oval</b> <b>window,</b> which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|The south transept's {{southern}} wall {{is nearly}} complete, displaying the fine workmanship {{of the first}} phase. It shows the Gothic pointed arch style in the windows that first appeared in France in the mid-12th century and was apparent in England around 1170, but hardly appeared in Scotland until the early 13th century. It also shows the round early Norman window design that continued {{to be used in}} Scotland during the entire Gothic period (Fig. 6). The windows and the quoins are of finely cut ashlar sandstone. A doorway in the south-west portion of the wall has large mouldings and has a pointed <b>oval</b> <b>window</b> placed above it. Adjacent to the doorway are two lancet-arched windows that are topped at the clerestory level with three round-headed windows. The north transept has much less of its structure preserved, but much of what does remain, taken together with a study by John Slezer in 1693, shows that it was similar to the south transept, except that the north transept had no external door and featured a stone turret containing a staircase.|$|E

25|$|In {{the middle}} ear, {{the energy of}} {{pressure}} waves is translated into mechanical vibrations by the three auditory ossicles. Pressure waves move the tympanic membrane which in turns moves the malleus, the first bone of the middle ear. The malleus articulates to incus which connects to the stapes. The footplate of the stapes connects to the <b>oval</b> <b>window,</b> {{the beginning of the}} inner ear. When the stapes presses on the <b>oval</b> <b>window,</b> it causes the perilymph, the liquid of the inner ear to move. The middle ear thus serves to convert the energy from sound pressure waves to a force upon the perilymph of the inner ear. The <b>oval</b> <b>window</b> has only approximately 1/18 the area of the tympanic membrane and thus produces a higher pressure. The cochlea propagates these mechanical signals as waves in the fluid and membranes, and then converts them to nerve impulses which are transmitted to the brain.|$|E

25|$|The stapes (stirrup) ossicle bone of {{the middle}} ear transmits {{vibrations}} to the fenestra ovalis (<b>oval</b> <b>window)</b> {{on the outside of the}} cochlea, which vibrates the perilymph in the vestibular duct (upper chamber of the cochlea). The ossicles are essential for efficient coupling of sound waves into the cochlea, since the cochlea environment is a fluid–membrane system, and it takes more pressure to move sound through fluid–membrane waves than it does through air; a pressure increase is achieved by the area ratio of the tympanic membrane to the <b>oval</b> <b>window,</b> resulting in a pressure gain of about 20 from the original sound wave pressure in air. This gain is a form of impedance matching – to match the soundwave travelling through air to that travelling in the fluid–membrane system.|$|E

25|$|The {{vibrations}} of the endolymph in {{the cochlear}} duct displace the basilar membrane {{in a pattern}} that peaks {{a distance from the}} <b>oval</b> <b>window</b> depending upon the soundwave frequency. The organ of Corti vibrates due to outer hair cells further amplifying these vibrations. Inner hair cells are then displaced by the vibrations in the fluid, and depolarise by an influx of K+ via their tip-link-connected channels, and send their signals via neurotransmitter to the primary auditory neurons of the spiral ganglion.|$|E
25|$|The cochlea {{is filled}} with a watery liquid, the perilymph, which moves in {{response}} to the vibrations coming from the middle ear via the <b>oval</b> <b>window.</b> As the fluid moves, the cochlear partition (basilar membrane and organ of Corti) moves; thousands of hair cells sense the motion via their stereocilia, and convert that motion to electrical signals that are communicated via neurotransmitters to many thousands of nerve cells. These primary auditory neurons transform the signals into electrochemical impulses known as action potentials, which travel along the auditory nerve to structures in the brainstem for further processing.|$|E
25|$|In reptiles, {{sound is}} {{transmitted}} to the inner ear by the stapes (stirrup) bone of the middle ear. This is pressed against the <b>oval</b> <b>window,</b> a membrane-covered opening {{on the surface of}} the vestibule. From here, sound waves are conducted through a short perilymphatic duct to a second opening, the round window, which equalizes pressure, allowing the incompressible fluid to move freely. Running parallel with the perilymphatic duct is a separate blind-ending duct, the lagena, filled with endolymph. The lagena is separated from the perilymphatic duct by a basilar membrane, and contains the sensory hair cells that finally translate the vibrations in the fluid into nerve signals. It is attached at one end to the saccule.|$|E

25|$|The {{walls of}} the hollow cochlea are made of bone, with a thin, {{delicate}} lining of epithelial tissue. This coiled tube is divided through most of its length by an inner membranous partition. Two fluid-filled outer spaces (ducts or scalae) are formed by this dividing membrane. At {{the top of the}} snailshell-like coiling tubes, there is a reversal of the direction of the fluid, thus changing the vestibular duct to the tympanic duct. This area is called the helicotrema. This continuation at the helicotrema allows fluid being pushed into the vestibular duct by the <b>oval</b> <b>window</b> to move back out via movement in the tympanic duct and deflection of the round window; since the fluid is nearly incompressible and the bony walls are rigid, it is essential for the conserved fluid volume to exit somewhere.|$|E
500|$|The stapes is {{the third}} bone of the three {{ossicles}} in the middle ear. The stapes is a stirrup-shaped bone, and the smallest in the human body. It rests on the <b>oval</b> <b>window,</b> {{to which it is}} connected by an annular ligament. The stapes is described as having a base, resting on the <b>oval</b> <b>window,</b> as well as a head that articulates with the incus. These are connected by anterior and posterior limbs (...) [...] The stapes articulates with the incus through the incudostapedial joint. The stapes is the smallest bone in the human body, and measures roughly 3 x 2.5mm, greater along the head-base span.|$|E
500|$|The stapes [...] or stirrup is a bone in {{the middle}} ear of humans and other mammals which is {{involved}} in the conduction of sound vibrations to the inner ear.

500|$|Otosclerosis is a {{congenital}} or spontaneous-onset disease {{characterized by}} abnormal bone remodeling {{in the inner}} ear. Often this causes the stapes {{to adhere to the}} <b>oval</b> <b>window,</b> which impedes its ability to conduct sound, and is a cause of conductive hearing loss. Clinical otosclerosis is found in about 1% of people, although it is more common in forms that do not cause noticeable hearing loss. Otosclerosis is more likely in young age groups, and females. Two common treatments are stapedectomy, the surgical removal of the stapes and replacement with an artificial prosthesis, and stapedotomy, the creation of a small hole in the base of the stapes followed by the insertion of an artificial prosthesis into that hole. [...] Surgery may be complicated by a persistent stapedial artery, fibrosis-related damage {{to the base of the}} bone, or obliterative otosclerosis, resulting in obliteration of the base.|$|E
500|$|The main {{entrance}} hall is a grand, high ceilinged room using oak panelling salvaged from the Warwick Priory.
