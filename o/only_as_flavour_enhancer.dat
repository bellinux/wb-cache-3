30|$|Erythritol is a four-carbon sugar alcohol, {{which is}} applied <b>as</b> <b>flavour</b> <b>enhancer,</b> {{formulation}} aid, humectants, stabilizer, thickener, and as low-calorie sweetener, {{of which the}} latter is the main utilization. It has a natural occurrence in several foods including beer, sake, wine, soy sauce, water melon, pear and grape (O’Donnell and Kearsley [2012]; Sreenath and Venkatesh [2008]) and is well tolerated by the human body (Munro et al. [1998]). Erythritol can be chemically synthesized from dialdehyde starch with a nickel catalyst at high temperatures, but this process is not stereospecific and low in yield, and therefore, not industrialized (Moon et al. [2010]). Instead erythritol is produced in biotechnological processes using osmophilic yeasts obtained by random mutagenesis as Aureobasidium sp. (Ishizuka et al. [1989]; Sasaki et al. [1990]), Trichosporonoides sp. (Suh et al. [1999]), (Torula sp. Oh et al. [2001]), and Candida magnoliae (Koh et al. [2003]; Ryu et al. [2000]). As substrate a highly concentrated glucose solution (typically 40 % (w/v)) is applied, which is gained from chemically and enzymatically hydrolyzed wheat- and cornstarch. It serves as carbon source and causes high osmotic pressure, which pushes the yeast to produce the osmolyte erythritol (reviewed by (Moon et al. [2010])).|$|R

In the present study, MSG intake and body weight were quantitatively assessed in 2002 and followed up in 2007. MSG intake was not associated with significant weight gain after adjusting for age, sex, multiple lifestyle factors and energy intake. When total glutamate intake was added to the model, an inverse association between MSG intake and 5 % weight gain was found (P = 0 · 028), but when the model was adjusted for either rice intake or food patterns, this association was abolished.

In this study, we {{determine}} if monosodium glutamate, after repeated oral administration, can induce {{any degree of}} anxiety. Taking into account the interdependence between glutamate and GABA neurotransmissions, we studied the possible interactions of monosodium glutamate with some representatives belonging to benzodiazepines therapeutical class, diazepam and alprazolam, used as first line therapy {{for the treatment of}} anxiety. Methods: For determining the degree of anxiety, the specific cross-labyrinth test was used. The medium time spent in the closed-arms of the crosslabyrinth is correlated with increased anxiety and the medium time spent in the opened arms is correlated with a low degree anxiety. NMRI adult mice received 300 mg/kg monosodium glutamate for 21 days, dose representing 1 / 50 from mice LD 50 (15000 mg/kg) and twice the maximum admitted dose/ day for human. Results: When compared to control group, the group receiving monosodium glutamate, showed a not statistically significant slight increase in the degree of anxiety. The groups receiving benzodiazepines presented a significant reduction of the degree of anxiety, proving their anxiolytic effect. The groups receiving glutamate and diazepam or alprazolam, showed a lower reduction of the degree of anxiety, than group receiving only benzodiazepines, phenomenon which proves an antagonism between glutamate and the anxiolytics used in this study. Conclusions: The oral administration of monosodium glutamate increases slightly, not statistically significant, the degree of anxiety in mice and significantly alters the response to the benzodiazepines therapy, reducing the effect for both alprazolam and diazepam...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{pinpoint}} {{the effects of the}} <b>flavour</b> <b>enhancer</b> Monosodium Glutamate; MSG on the histology and ultrastructure of the testes. Such effects were monitored after giving 10 (Short-term) and 30 (Long-term) oral doses each was 4 g kg - 1 body weight; a third of LD 50, of MSG to adult white rats Rattus norvegicus. Their testes were routinely processed for examination with the light and electron microscopes. The seminiferous tubules of rats treated with MSG for short-term exhibited slight to moderate damage. The slight damage of the tubules included appearance of vacuoles and loss of late spermatids. The vacuoles were found inside the cytoplasm of the spermatogonia, the primary spermatocytes and Sertoli cells. Some seminiferous tubules displayed sloughing of impaired early spermatids into their lumina. Other tubules showed complete loss of early and late spermatids. Due to shrinkage of many tubules the intertubular spaces widened. By using the electron microscope, the primary spermatocytes revealed loss of cristae of many of their mitochondria, great enlargement of Golgi apparatus and disruption of the nuclear envelope as well. The sloughed early spermatids possessed irregular head caps, dilated endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria with fused cristae and few cytoplasmic vacuoles. Also, few mitochondria of these cells underwent disorganization of their distribution. Mitochondria of Sertoli cells exhibited loss of {{some or all of the}} cristae. In case of long-term treatment with MSG, the testes of rats contained severely damaged tubules. Such seminiferous tubules were characterized by containing only Sertoli cells almost arranged in a ring together with occasional occurrence of ruined spermatogenic cells and appearance of masses of necrotic germ cells. Many mitochondria with disintegrated cristae were noticed in the severely perished primary spermatocytes. Sertoli cells showed extensive vacuolation, disintegration of the cytoplasm and highly harmed mitochondria with electron-dense matrices. The structural changes of testes of the MSG-treated rats were found to be dosage-duration-dependent and ranged from slight to moderate damage in case of the short-term treatment however, severe damage was recorded in the case of the long-term treatment. Thus, it is important to reconsider the usage of MSG <b>as</b> a <b>flavour</b> <b>enhancer...</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: D-tagatose is {{a natural}} low-calorie bulk {{sweetener}} (1. 5 kcal/g) showing 92 % of the sweetness of sucrose. It is low glycaemic, non-cariogenic and has prebiotic properties. Besides this wide range of healthy benefits, D-tagatose can also be applied <b>as</b> <b>flavour</b> <b>enhancer</b> and <b>flavour</b> creator in many applications. Tagatose significantly reduces the lingering sweetness and the bitter and metallic off-flavour of high intensity sweeteners. The natural occurrence of D-tagatose is however too limited for the increasing interest in this alternative sweetener. Chemical production of D-tagatose from D-galactose is economically not feasible due to byproduct formation and complex waste water treatment steps. A biocatalysed process using an immobilised L-arabinose isomerase enzyme for galactose isomerisation is therefore part of this study. Materials and methods: A wild type L-arabinose isomerase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus is used as enzyme source for bioconversion of D-galactose to D-tagatose with Escherichia coli (BL 21) strain as expression host. Cells are harvested from culture broth by centrifugation and are resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7) or ringer solution. Different biomass concentrations are immobilised with 5 % v/v alginate in a 1 / 1 biomass/alginate volumetric ratio. Biomass concentration is varied between 1. 3 and 6. 5 %. Batch conversion experiments are performed in a thermostatic shaking bath at 60 °C. Bead concentration is varied between 10 and 30 %. A galactose solution of 360 g/l is used as substrate, containing 1 mM MnCl 2 as co-factor at pH 7. Samples are analysed by HPLC with refractive index detection. Results and discussion: Tagatose production increases with a higher biomass concentration immobilised in alginate. By varying the biomass concentration from 1. 3 to 6. 5 % at a bead concentration of 20 %, the tagatose concentration obtained after 24 hours increases from 27 to 65 g/l. The increase in tagatose production is however not linearly correlated to the biomass concentration. A similar conclusion can be drawn for {{the influence of the}} bead concentration. At a biomass concentration of 3. 3 % w/v, tagatose concentration increases from 29 to 56 g/l for an increase in bead concentration of 10 to 30 %. No significant influence of the diluent of the biomass is noticed on tagatose production. What’s innovative: An enzymatic bioprocess is developed and optimised for production of D-tagatose from D-galactose. Besides the unique benefits of tagatose for many food applications (low caloric value, low glycaemic, non-cariogenic and prebiotic properties, less lingering artificial sweetener aftertaste), the application of an L-arabinose isomerase for production of D-tagatose results in a highly selective and environmentally friendly production process, which is not yet available on the current industrial market. As sugar substitute, tagatose will help to control weight, tooth decay and will be a major help in comfort of diabetics. status: publishe...|$|R
