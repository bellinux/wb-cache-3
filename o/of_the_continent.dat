5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather in the first few weeks of winter, the eastern half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E

5|$|Three species {{occur in}} both New Guinea and Australia.

Some cockatoos have been introduced accidentally to areas outside their natural range such as New Zealand, Singapore, and Palau, while two Australian corella species have been introduced to parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> where they are not native.|$|E

The finding of one especially large lake (Uniamési) is depicted in a map known as the 'Slug' map. It was known by this name because the layout of the water body suggested a shape similar to that of a slug.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica {{is a cold}} {{region with}} a ground base above sea level and {{occupies}} most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent.</b> This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows.

However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.|$|E

Faced with German domination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent,</b> the only weapon the British could use to exert immediate military pressure on Germany was the night bombing operations of RAF Bomber Command.|$|E

5|$|In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist Richard Schodde {{proposed}} a northern origin for the chestnut-shouldered fairywren group {{due to the}} variety of forms {{in the north and}} their absence in the southeast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent.</b> Ancestral birds spread south and colonised the southwest during a warm and wetter period around 2 million years ago {{at the end of the}} Pliocene or beginning of the Pleistocene. Subsequent cooler and drier conditions resulted in loss of habitat and fragmentation of populations. Southwestern birds gave rise to what is now the red-winged fairywren, while those in the northwest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> became the variegated fairywren. Further warmer, humid conditions again allowed birds to spread southwards; this group, occupying central southern Australia east to the Eyre Peninsula, became the blue-breasted fairywren. Cooler climate after this resulted in this being isolated as well and evolving into a separate species. Finally, after the end of the last glacial period 12,00013,000years ago, the northern variegated forms have again spread southwards. This has resulted in the ranges of all three species overlapping. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified.|$|E
40|$|This article {{reports for}} first time <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> science and {{technology}} in <b>the</b> African <b>Continent</b> on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> two scientometric indicators - number of research publications and number of patents awarded. Our analysis shows that Africa produced 68 945 publications over the 2000 - 2004 period or 1. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world’s publications. In comparison India produced 2. 4 % and Latin America 3. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world’s research. More detailed analysis reveals that research in Africa is concentrated in just two countries – South Africa and Egypt. These two counties produce just above 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Continent’s</b> publications and <b>the</b> top 8 countries produce above 80 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent’s</b> research.

Examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent’s</b> inventive profile, as manifested in patents, indicates that Africa produces less than one thousand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world’s inventions.
