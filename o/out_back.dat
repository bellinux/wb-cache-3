5|$|Smith {{meanwhile}} continued working {{towards the}} A∴A∴ grade of Zelator, while the British Columbia Lodge No. 1 became increasingly moribund {{following the death}} of White, a key member, who had succumbed to Spanish Flu aged 33 in November 1918. Jones had rejoined the O.T.O. and relocated to Detroit in the United States. When Smith was fired from his job following a bout of flu in February 1920, he decided to join Jones in Detroit, where there was a small O.T.O. community; there he gained work as a clerk with the Detroit City Gas Company. In his absence, Nem was appointed Right Worshipful Master of the Vancouver lodge. In March 1921, Jones and Smith proceeded to Chicago, but in June Smith returned to North Vancouver to see his family. That year, Jones convinced Smith to join an esoteric organisation known as the Universal Brotherhood (UB). Smith however was unnerved that rather than expressing a Thelemic viewpoint, the UB adhered to Roman Catholicism, and he also considered its literature purposeless, vague, and grandiose; he soon dropped <b>out.</b> <b>Back</b> in Vancouver, Smith aided one of his initiates, Frank Page, in founding the British Columbia Lodge No. 3 in Kamloops, creating all the furniture for their temple. Nevertheless, the lodge closed after a year, with Smith's own British Columbia Lodge No. 1 also becoming defunct in February 1922.|$|E

The steering was a power-assisted recirculating ball design.|$|E

50|$|<b>Out</b> and <b>back</b> {{refers to}} the layout of a roller coaster. An <b>out</b> and <b>back</b> coaster is one that climbs a lift hill soon after leaving the station, races out {{to the far end}} of the track after the initial drop, {{performs}} a 180 degree turn and then returns to the station. Some <b>out</b> and <b>back</b> coasters perform more complicated turns at the far end of the track.|$|R

25|$|That night, Spade is {{awakened by}} {{a phone call from}} the police and {{informed}} that Archer has been killed. He meets his friend, Police Detective Tom Polhaus (Ward Bond), at the murder scene. He tries calling Wonderly at her hotel, but she has checked <b>out.</b> <b>Back</b> at his apartment, he is grilled by Polhaus and Lieutenant Dundy (Barton MacLane), who tell him that Thursby was also murdered the same evening. Dundy suggests that Spade had the opportunity and motive to kill Thursby, who likely killed Archer, immediately after he learned of Archer's death. Archer's widow Iva (Gladys George) believes that Spade shot his partner so he could have her.|$|E
25|$|While {{the rest}} of the adults in town and a visiting {{television}} crew film a reenactment for America's Most Wanted, a tree falls on the power line causing the power to go out. All of the adults are now stuck in a building until the storm settles. The group hastily resort to cannibalism to survive. The power also goes <b>out</b> <b>back</b> at the hospital, and a plan is enacted to restore it. Dr. Doctor suggests that they split into two teams: team A, consisting of everyone in the room except Kenny, and team B, consisting of Kenny. His job is to reconnect the generator, while team A give advice to Kenny via walkie-talkie.|$|E
50|$|A {{good example}} of the {{difference}} between an <b>out</b> and <b>back</b> design and twister design is layouts of Apollo's Chariot and Raging Bull, two Bolliger & Mabillard designed hypercoaster roller coasters that debuted in 1999. Apollo's Chariot uses a traditional <b>out</b> and <b>back</b> layout while Raging Bull is a twister.|$|R

25|$|Elliot, Alma, and Jess next {{come upon}} the {{isolated}} house of Mrs. Jones, a negative, elderly eccentric {{who has no}} outside contact with society and is unaware of the current disaster. The following morning, Mrs. Jones becomes infected with the toxin. Realizing that the plants are now targeting individuals, Elliot locks himself in the basement but is separated from Alma and Jess, {{who are in the}} home's springhouse <b>out</b> <b>back.</b> They are able to communicate through an old talking tube, and Elliot warns them of the threat. He expresses his love for her before deciding that if he is to die, he would prefer to spend his remaining time with her. The three leave the safety of their buildings and embrace in the yard, surprised to find themselves unaffected by the neurotoxin. The outbreak has abated as quickly as it began.|$|E
25|$|After the war, the Macks {{wanted to}} expand the seating {{capacity}} again, in a park that {{was running out of}} room to expand into. In 1949, they proposed erecting the ultimate spite fence: a new double-deck seating section in right field that would boost the park's capacity to 50,000. The problem was that the home plate-to-right field axis was the shorter dimension of the Shibe block rectangle, and since the new stand could not intrude into the play area, its fascia would {{have to be in the}} plane of the existing right field fence while its hindquarters would have to protrude <b>out</b> <b>back,</b> dangling some 15 feet above the west sidewalk of North 20th Street and forming a covered arcade walkway. The $2.5-million proposal galvanized the 20th Street neighbors against the A's again, and this time the legal team could not overcome the zoning issues.|$|E
25|$|In February 2008, Died Pretty re-formed {{to perform}} Doughboy Hollow in its {{entirety}} {{as part of the}} All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series, using that album's line-up – Clark, Hoey, Myers, Peno and Welsh – playing {{together for the first time}} in sixteen years. Peno revealed that a documentary was pending – featuring interviews with band members, and rehearsal and concert footage from the Melbourne shows. Doughboy Hollow was remastered, expanded and reissued by Citadel Records in February. The tour included shows in all major capital cities. The line-up continued with appearances at the 2008 Homebake Festival in Sydney and as 'EG Awards Hall of Fame' inductees on 4 December in Melbourne. They appeared on the nationwide Big Day Out tour in January 2009, having played the inaugural Big Day <b>Out</b> <b>back</b> in 1992. A 2×CD deluxe reissue of their debut album Free Dirt was released through Aztec Music in late 2008, and an expanded reissue of 1988's Lost was released in June 2013. Peno & Myers performed an acoustic set at the Orient Hotel, Brisbane, on 7 November 2009 for a private party. Peno had returned to his solo career by May 2010. In October 2010, Doughboy Hollow (1991) was listed in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums.|$|E

500|$|Al Capone and {{his family}} lived in the two-story red brick duplex at 7244 South Prairie Avenue from 1923, which is shortly after he moved to Chicago, until 1931, when he was sent off to prison for income tax fraud. [...] The Capone family kept the home until his mother's death in 1952. In 1988, the privately owned house was {{nominated}} for the National Register of Historic Places by historians {{as the home of}} one of Chicago's most famous citizens. The nomination was withdrawn after local politicians and members of Italian-American groups sharply argued that it would appear to validate the life of a murderer and hoodlum. [...] The house retains the security bars on the basement windows and the brick garage <b>out</b> <b>back,</b> which the Capone built for his bullet-proof Cadillac limousine.|$|E
500|$|Initially, The Sydney Morning Herald {{reported}} that the final catalyst for the move on Rudd was sparked by a report that Rudd had used {{his chief of staff}} to sound <b>out</b> <b>back</b> benchers on his level of support, thus implying that [...] "he did not trust the repeated assurances by Ms Gillard that she would not stand". Later, ABC's 7:30 Report said the seeds for the challenge to Rudd came from [...] "factional heavyweights" [...] Bill Shorten and Senator David Feeney, who secured the support of [...] "New South Wales right power broker" [...] Mark Arbib and that Feeney and Arbib went to discuss a challenge with Gillard on the morning of 23 June and a final numbers count began for a challenge. Accounts have continued to differ as to the extent of Gillard's foreknowledge and planning of the replacement of Rudd.|$|E
500|$|Manchester United captain Roy Keane infamously confronted Vieira in {{the players}} tunnel before the return fixture {{later in the}} season, which United won 4–2 at Highbury. This came about by an {{incident}} during the pre-game warm up when Vieira had allegedly pushed Gary Neville after confronting the player about the challenges Pirès suffered at Old Trafford earlier in the season. Once Keane found <b>out</b> <b>back</b> in the United locker room, he unleashed a verbal tirade on Vieira including telling the Arsenal skipper [...] "I'll see you out there". The match that followed was another ill-spirited affair with both sides guilty of harsh challenges, which also saw Mikaël Silvestre sent off after a clash with Ljungberg. United {{went on to win}} the game, coming from behind twice before holding onto the lead, despite being reduced to 10 men for the last third of the match.|$|E

500|$|Romeo begs Friar Lawrence, a sea otter, to wed them. After some thought, the friar {{believes}} {{their marriage}} {{will end the}} feud between their families, and agrees. Romeo and Juliet are wed that morning and traverse the sea in their happiness. However, even the other sea and land animals strongly oppose their being together. A fish finds them a lovely couple, but warns them {{that they will be}} in big trouble if the Prince finds <b>out.</b> <b>Back</b> on the beach, Mercutio is telling many jokes, which leads to him making insulting jokes against the Capulets, and the Prince is headed in that direction. When he arrives, Mercutio mocks him as well. Romeo rushes to aid his friend, but after a struggle Mercutio falls off the cliff where Juliet met Romeo the previous evening, and everyone thinks that he is dead. The Prince, jealous of Juliet's affection for Romeo, exiles Romeo to Shark Island. In despair, Juliet seeks the Friar's help, and he gives her a potion to put her in a deathlike state. Mercutio is revealed to be alive and sees the whole thing, remarking, [...] "What a tangled web we weave." ...|$|E
500|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. Homer's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no characters other than Homer, Grampa Simpson, Lenny, and Krusty the Clown have a similar beard line. When Groening originally designed Homer, he put his initials into the character's hairline and ear: the hairline resembled an 'M', and the right ear resembled a 'G'. Groening decided that this would be too distracting and redesigned the ear to look normal. However, he still draws the ear as a 'G' when he draws pictures of Homer for fans. The basic shape of Homer's head is described by director Mark Kirkland as a tube-shaped coffee can with a salad bowl on top. Bart's head is also coffee-can shaped, while spheres are used for Marge, Lisa, and Maggie. During the shorts, the animators experimented with the way Homer would move his mouth when talking. At one point, his mouth would stretch <b>out</b> <b>back</b> [...] "beyond his beardline"; but this was dropped when it got [...] "out of control." [...] In some early episodes, Homer's hair was rounded rather than sharply pointed because animation director Wes Archer felt it should look disheveled. Homer's hair evolved to be consistently pointed. During the first three seasons, Homer's design for some close-up shots included small lines which were meant to be eyebrows. Matt Groening strongly disliked them and they were eventually dropped.|$|E
