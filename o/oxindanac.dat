40|$|A {{simple and}} humane model of inflammation, {{induced by the}} {{intradermal}} injection of 0. 3 mL of sterile 2 % carrageenan, was characterized in calves by measuring the volume of skin swelling plus histological analysis of skin biopsies. Carrageenan produced a biphasic increase in skin swelling, with an early edematous response followed by a more chronic cellular infiltrate. The swelling and sensitivity to pressure observed in the early response were suitable for testing the antiedematous and analgesic activity of a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), <b>oxindanac.</b> Pretreatment with intravenous <b>oxindanac</b> at doses from 0. 5 to 8. 0 mg/kg reduced the volume of swelling and this reached statistical significance (p < 0. 05) at 2 mg/kg. The ED 50 and ED 90 values for inhibition of the peak swelling volume (4 h) were estimated to be 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg, respectively. These compare with an ED 90 of 2. 0 mg/kg for inhibition of serum TxB 2 production, an index of platelet cyclo-oxygenase activity. The dose of <b>oxindanac</b> required for antiedematous activity correlated, therefore, with maximal inhibition of serum TxB 2. The analgesic activity of <b>oxindanac</b> reached no clear maximum response, but statistically significant difference (p < 0. 05) from placebo was reached with doses of 2 mg/kg and above. It is concluded that intradermal carrageenan produced a simple, humane and useful model for dose estimation of a new NSAID in calves...|$|E
