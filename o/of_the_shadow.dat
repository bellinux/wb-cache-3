5|$|At its 2010 {{summit in}} Seoul, South Korea, the G-20 collectively {{endorsed}} a new collection of capital adequacy and liquidity standards for banks recommended by Basel III. Andreas Dombret of the Executive Board of Deutsche Bundesbank has noted a difficulty in identifying institutions that constitute systemic importance via their size, complexity, {{and degree of}} interconnectivity within the global financial system, and that efforts {{should be made to}} identify a group of 25 to 30 indisputable globally systemic institutions. He has suggested they be held to standards higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite the inevitability of institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> banking system.|$|E

5|$|Despite his meager {{political}} experience—having previously {{served only}} {{three years in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives—Johnson labored vehemently to ensure the success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> government. Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861, but the shadow government's influence in the Commonwealth extended only as far as the Confederate Army advanced. When Albert Sidney Johnston abandoned the Confederate capital of Bowling Green, Governor Johnson and the other government officials accompanied him. Despite his advanced age and a crippled arm, Johnson volunteered for military service in General Johnston's army. Johnson was killed at the Battle of Shiloh, making him the only state governor, Union or Confederate, to fall in battle during the Civil War. He was succeeded by Richard Hawes, the second and last governor of Confederate Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Photovoltaic (PV) arrays powered Mir. The station used a 28volt DC supply which {{provided}} 5-, 10-, 20- and 50-amp taps. When {{the station was}} illuminated by sunlight, several solar arrays mounted on the pressurised modules provided power to Mirs systems and charged the nickel-cadmium storage batteries installed throughout the station. The arrays rotated in only one degree of freedom over a 180° arc, and tracked the sun using sun sensors and motors installed in the array mounts. The station itself also had to be oriented to ensure optimum illumination of the arrays. When the station's all-sky sensor detected that Mir had entered Earth's shadow, the arrays were rotated to the optimum angle predicted for reacquiring the sun once the station passed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow.</b> The batteries, each of 60Ah capacity, were then used to power the station until the arrays recovered their maximum output on the day side of Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{papers in}} the series were treatises on gravitational radiation (one with Sachs, one with Trümper). The work with Sachs studies, among other things, vacuum solutions with special algebraic properties, using the 2-component spinor formalism. It also gives a systematic exposition of the geometric properties of bundles (in mathematical terms: congruences) of light beams. Spacetime geometry can influence the propagation of light, making them converge on or diverge from each other, or deforming the bundle's cross section without changing its area. The paper formalizes these possible changes in the bundle {{in terms of the}} bundle's expansion (convergence/divergence), and twist and shear (cross-section area-conserving deformation), linking those properties to spacetime geometry. One result is the Ehlers-Sachs theorem describing the properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> produced by a narrow beam of light encountering an opaque object. The tools developed in that work would prove essential for the discovery by Roy Kerr of his Kerr solution, describing a rotating black hole – {{one of the most important}} exact solutions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the field}} of entertainment, Mutual built on the {{incomparable}} success <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Shadow.</b> WGN's Chicago Theater of the Air, featuring hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast {{for the first time}} in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. Chicago Theater of the Air would run on Mutual through March 1955. Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan, whose show Here's Morgan began its network run in October 1940. Though The Lone Ranger moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. The Adventures of Superman, picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as The Return of Nick Carter and later retitled Nick Carter, Master Detective, it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, reprising their roles from the Universal film series. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to Mutual from September 1947 through June 1949. The Mysterious Traveler, a proto–Twilight Zone anthology series, aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.|$|E
5|$|On March 21, 2009, Ubisoft {{released}} {{a special edition}} <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Shadow</b> of the Templars for the Wii and Nintendo DS. According to Cecil, the Director's Cut came about thanks {{to a group of}} Broken Sword fans, who started an online petition begging him to bring the series to the Wii and DS. The game starts a day before the Parisian cafe explosion in the original game, filling in some of Nicole Collard's back-story. Dave Gibbons, with whom Revolution worked previously on their 1994 cult classic adventure Beneath a Steel Sky, worked on visual references for the game; He also produced a comic book to accompany the game's DS release. In the Director's Cut, Hazel Ellerby returns to voice Nicole Collard in the new sections, playing Nico again {{for the first time since}} the original game's release. Rolf Saxon, as in every sequel, also returns to voice George Stobbart. Unlike in the original game, players control Nicole Collard for selected game sections. Besides the new character artwork by Gibbons during conversations, the Director's Cut also features a new first person view for certain puzzles. In the DS version, there is no spoken dialogue, only subtitles. A version of the Director's Cut for iPhone and iPod Touch was released on January 20, 2010. In May 2010, a version with higher resolution and a digital comic was released on the iPad. A PC version was released on August 27, 2010 on various digital distribution services.|$|E
5|$|Seven years later, {{an older}} Link awakens {{in an area}} of the Sacred Realm known as the Chamber of Sages and is met by Rauru, one of the seven sages who protect the {{entrance}} to the Sacred Realm. Rauru explains that Link's spirit was sealed for seven years until he was old enough to wield the Master Sword and defeat Ganondorf, who has now taken over Hyrule. The seven sages can imprison Ganondorf in the Sacred Realm, but five are unaware of their identities as sages. Link is returned to the Temple of Time; there he meets the mysterious Sheik, who guides him to free five temples from Ganondorf's control, allowing each temple's sage to awaken. Link befriended all five sages as a child: Saria, the Sage of the Forest Temple; Darunia, the Sage of the Fire Temple; Ruto, the Sage of the Water Temple; Impa, the Sage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shadow</b> Temple; and Nabooru, the Sage of the Spirit Temple. After the five sages awaken, Sheik reveals herself to be Zelda in disguise, and the seventh sage. She tells Link that Ganondorf's heart was unbalanced, causing the Triforce to split into three pieces. Ganondorf acquired only the Triforce of Power, while Zelda received the Triforce of Wisdom and Link the Triforce of Courage.|$|E

5|$|On March 17, Brunson helped Stevenson {{qualify for}} a third {{consecutive}} appearance in the IHSA final four with a victory over Riverside Brookfield Township High School. In the game, Brunson became the Lake County career scoring record holder. On March 19, Brunson received the highest vote total for the Illinois Class 4A Associated Press All-state team. On March 20, he repeated as Illinois Gatorade Player of the Year. Brunson led Stevenson to the IHSA final four for a third consecutive time, but he led the team to the first state championship by a Lake county school with an IHSA Class 4A title-game record 30 points in a 57-40 victory over Normal Community High School. Brunson was 9-for-15 {{from the field and}} 9-for-9 from the free throw line. 2015 was Lake county's ninth consecutive year with a team reaching the IHSA final four; Stevenson became the first school in the large school division and the third school overall to win IHSA football and basketball state championships in the same year. The win got him out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> of IHSA final four losses to Parker- and Okafor-led teams. Following the season, he won Illinois Mr. Basketball with 552 points and 99 of the 132 first place votes ahead of fellow Jordan Brand All-American selection Charles Matthews who had 157 points. Brunson finished his senior season with averages of 23.3 points, 5.2 assists and 4.7 rebounds per game and with shooting percentages of 38% on three point shots and 83% on free throws. At the March 30 POWERADE Jam Fest associated with the McDonald's All-American game, Brunson won the skills competition over finalists Carlton Bragg and Isaiah Briscoe and was a finalist for the three-point shooting contest. Brunson was a first-team Parade All-American, as well as a third-team USA Today All-USA high school basketball team selection. In the April 11 Nike Hoops Summit, Brunson had 12 points and 7 assists in a 103101 loss. In the April 17 Jordan Brand Classic, Brunson had a game-high 3 steals. He finished his high school career ranked #16 in the ESPN 100 and as the #2 point guard (behind Isaiah Briscoe).|$|E
