25|$|Methylene blue {{is also a}} {{photosensitizer}} used {{to create}} singlet oxygen when exposed to both oxygen and light. It is used in this regard to make <b>organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> by a Diels-Alder reaction which is spin forbidden with normal atmospheric triplet oxygen.|$|E
25|$|It {{is used in}} the {{production}} of various <b>organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> with dibenzoyl peroxide being a high volume example. This is used in polymerisations, as a flour bleaching agent and as a treatment for acne. Peroxy acids, such as peracetic acid and meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid are also typically produced using hydrogen peroxide.|$|E
25|$|Ethers like {{diethyl ether}} and {{tetrahydrofuran}} (THF) can form highly explosive <b>organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> upon exposure to oxygen and light. THF is normally {{more likely to}} form such peroxides than diethyl ether.

25|$|Because COT is {{unstable}} and easily forms explosive <b>organic</b> <b>peroxides,</b> {{a small amount}} of hydroquinone is usually added to commercially available material. Testing for peroxides is advised when using a previously opened bottle; white crystals around the neck of the bottle may be composed of the peroxide, which may explode when mechanically disturbed.|$|E

2500|$|This {{degradation}} can {{be prevented}} through the addition of 5–100 ppm of antioxidants, such as phenylenediamines and other amines. Hydrocarbons with a bromine number of 10 or above can be protected with the combination of unhindered or partially hindered phenols and oil-soluble strong amine bases, such as hindered phenols.

40|$|The {{liquid phase}} {{hydrocarbon}} oxidation is studied in a packed bed membrane reactor. A mathematical model is developed, reaction simulations are performed and interpreted using the conversion, <b>organic</b> <b>peroxide</b> efficiency and oxidation product separation factor. The influence of several process parameters, such as space time, overall membrane mass transfer coefficient and aqueous-organic phase distribution coefficient is investigated. A {{substantial increase in}} <b>organic</b> <b>peroxide</b> efficiency was observed in the packed bed membrane reactor configuration as compared to a conventional packed bed reactor.

2500|$|Although many {{different}} peroxyacids {{are used for}} the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation, {{some of the more}} common oxidants include meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) and trifluoroperacetic acid (TFPAA). The general trend is that higher reactivity is correlated with lower pKa (i.e.: stronger acidity) of the corresponding carboxylic acid (or alcohol {{in the case of the}} peroxides). [...] Therefore, the reactivity trend shows TFPAA > 4-nitroperbenzoic acid > mCPBA and performic acid > peracetic acid > hydrogen peroxide > tert-butyl hydroperoxide. The peroxides are much less reactive than the peroxyacids. The use of hydrogen peroxide even requires a catalyst. In addition, using <b>organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> and hydrogen peroxide tends to generate more side-reactivity due to their promiscuity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> {{may be in}} {{the solid}} or liquid state. There are no <b>organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> in the vapor state.

50|$|<b>Organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> are organic {{compounds}} containing the peroxide functional group (ROOR′). If the R′ is hydrogen, the compounds are called organic hydroperoxides. Peresters have general structure RC(O)OOR. The O−O bond easily breaks, producing free radicals {{of the form}} RO•. Thus, <b>organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> are useful as initiators for some types of polymerisation, such as the epoxy resins used in glass-reinforced plastics. MEKP and benzoyl peroxide are commonly used for this purpose. However, the same property also means that <b>organic</b> <b>peroxides</b> can either intentionally or unintentionally initiate explosive polymerisation in materials with unsaturated chemical bonds, and this process {{has been used in}} explosives. <b>Organic</b> <b>peroxides,</b> like their inorganic counterparts, are powerful bleaching agents.|$|E
