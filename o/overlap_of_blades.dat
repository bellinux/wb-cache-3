The mechanism may also be suitable for use in laboratory and industrial vacuum systems on Earth for which there are similar requirements. The requirements include the following: a) To alternately close, then open, a 1. 5 -cm-diameter optical aperture twice per second, with a stroke time of no more than 15 ms, during a total operational lifetime of at least a year; b) To attenuate light by a factor of at least 1012 when in the closed position; c) To generate little or no magnetic field; d) To be capable of withstanding bakeout at a temperature of 200 C to minimize outgassing during subsequent operation in an ultrahigh vacuum; and e) To fit within a diameter of 12 in.

40|$|Under the {{intrinsic}} variability {{of the wind}} speed and its exponential relationship with the rotor torque, the power control systems play an increasingly important role in terms of efficiency {{and stability in the}} modern and large wind turbines. The paper describes a power control system based on swept band area dimensional regulation (DBB) that it is particularly well suited for off-shore wind turbines. After an introduction of the modern power control strategies and revised their current limitations, the theoretical fundamentals of the new approach are formulated. The system operates jointly with pitch or active stall controls but dedicated to the low wind speed range. In this range, the dynamic pair <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> <b>blade</b> segments may increase or decrease their swept band areas aiming to reach a constant rated power output. With maximum total swept area larger and with minimum swept area lesser than the current wind turbines of the same class, the proposed control system may provide the rated power of the wind turbine in a broader wind speed range. Preliminary simulation results in the experimental offshore wind site of âMar de Canarias â are presented. These results show an augmented annual energy yield that remarkably compensates the added complexity due to the incorporation of the new control system. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Blade which {{transfers}} {{thermal energy}} of steam into power, {{is a basic}} component in steam turbine. The reliability <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> is heavily influenced by the operating environment. The rotating blade experiences large inertial load and the wake of nozzle flow impose large variations of aerodynamic load on blade, in addition, the last stage blade is also affected by corrosion, so accidents <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> happen from time to time. Preventing blade failure {{has become one of}} the major objectives of turbine design and in-service maintenance. It is said that the reason for most <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> failure is fatigue fracture. In this study, a synthetical numerical model has been developed to evaluate service life <b>of</b> <b>blade.</b> At first, a numerical model to analyze the excitation force, dynamic frequency and dynamic stress <b>of</b> steam turbine <b>blade</b> has been developed, based on the results of dynamic stress analysis, a model to evaluate the service life <b>of</b> turbine <b>blade</b> has been developed.
