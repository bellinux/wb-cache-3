5000|$|... : Public Procurement Law 2004, revised in 2009. Direct offsets are {{supervised}} by the Defense Ministry, and indirect <b>offsets</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of Economy and Energy. There is however a Permanent Inter-Ministerial Council of Special Purpose Public Procurement to approve offset agreements. The Agency for Information, Technology and Communications (SAITC) assists and coordinates offset projects. The threshold for offset is 5 million Euro. The minimum Value is 110% {{of the contract}} value. Multipliers are between 1 and 3. Offsets are generally 30% direct and 70% indirect.http://www.mee.government.bg/eng/offsetp/offsetp/docs.html?id=201014 ...|$|E
50|$|In {{temperate}} zones, the corms of {{most species}} and hybrids should be lifted in autumn and stored over winter in a frost-free place, then replanted in spring. Some species from Europe and high altitudes in Africa, {{as well as}} the small 'Nanus' hybrids, are much hardier (to at least -15 °F/-26 °C) and can be left in the ground in regions with sufficiently dry winters. 'Nanus' is hardy to Zones 5-8. The large-flowered types require moisture during the growing season, and must be individually staked as soon as the sword-shaped flower heads appear. The leaves must be allowed to die down naturally before lifting and storing the corms. Plants are propagated either from small cormlets produced as <b>offsets</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> parent corms, or from seed. In either case, they take several years to get to flowering size. Clumps should be dug up and divided every few years to keep them vigorous.|$|E

Coupled models of plates and thermal convection quantitatively show both eustatic and epeirogenic controls on long-term uplift and subsidence of Earth's surface from regional to global scales. Eustasy and epeirogeny {{can no longer be}} viewed as mutually exclusive hypotheses explaining continental stratigraphy-both arise with nearly equivalent amplitudes, but with complex phase <b>offsets,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> same system of global convection. Dynamic models assist in the interpretation of the stratigraphic record, which has long been known to show that continents undergo both eustatic and epeirogenic motions...|$|E

40|$|The {{extension}} of the 26 meter antenna to 34 meter diameter decreased the F/D ratio. This F/D change resulted in unacceptable gain losses due to the hyperboloid's lateral deflections. A three direction translating mounting device {{was added to the}} hyperboloid. This device was controlled by a microprocessor to minimize the offsets of the phase centers in the cassegrain RF system and also compensated for boresight directions. The use of the radiation program to predict the gain losses from displacements computed by a structural computing program using an analytical model of the 34 meter reflector structure is discussed. Field test results showed accurate predictions for the Y and Z hyperboloid translations. In the X direction, the prediction value was low. However, the computed gain losses vs primary foci <b>offsets</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> radiation program were verified by field tests...|$|E
30|$|Dilute nitride III–V {{semiconductor}} alloys in {{thin films}} with variable bandgap {{have been on}} the extensively studied material systems [1 – 10] for optical telecommunications applications. Introduction of very low nitrogen concentrations is sufficient to modulate the band gap of such systems over a wide range. Amongst the possible III–V-based dilute nitride materials, GaAsSbN systems in the thin film configuration have been proven {{to be one of the}} promising systems for the spectral window of 1.3 – 1.55  μm [1]. Simultaneous reduction in the band gap with lattice parameter and also independent tuning of conduction and valence band <b>offsets</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> N and Sb constituents, respectively, are the distinguishing features of this system. However, large disparity in the atomic radius of N and Sb creates N-induced defects and compositional disorder leading to non-radiative recombination centers, which adversely affect the optoelectronic properties of the thin film. It is well established that considerable improvement in the optical properties occurs on annealing due to the annihilation of N-related centers. Reducing dimensionality further to nanowires, for example, may prove to be advantageous for this system in terms of efficient annihilation of point defects and enhanced photon collection due to the large surface to volume ratio.|$|E
40|$|We propose {{and explore}} {{financial}} instruments supporting programs for reducing emissions from deforestaion and forest degradation (FI-REDD). Within a microeconomic framework we model interactions between an electricity producer (EP), electricity consumer (EC), and forest owner (FO). To keep their profit at a maximum, the EP responds to increasing CO 2 prices by adjusting electricity quantities generated by different technologies and charging a higher electricity price to the EC. The EP can hedge against future high (uncertain) CO 2 prices by employing FI-REDD: they can purchase {{an amount of}} offsets under an unknown future CO 2 price and later, when the CO 2 price is discovered, decide {{how many of these}} offsets to use for actually offsetting emissions and sell the rest on the market sharing the revenue with the FO. FI-REDD allows for optimal consumption of emission <b>offsets</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> EP (any amount up to the initially contracted volume is allowed), and includes a benefit sharing mechanism between the EP and FO as it regards unused offsets. The modeling results indicate that the FI-REDD might help avoid bankruptcy of CO 2 -intensive producers at high levels of CO 2 prices and therefore serve as stabilizing mechanism during the transition of energy systems to greener technologies. The analytical results demonstrate the limits for potential market size explained by existing uncertainties. We illustrated that when suppliers and consumers of REDD offsets have asymmetric information on future CO 2 prices, benefit sharing increases the contracted REDD offsets quantity...|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} studies, we {{have proposed}} financial instruments supporting REDD (FI-REDD). Within a microeconomic framework we modeled interactions between an electricity producer (EP), electricity consumer (EC), and forest owner (FO). FI-REDD allows for optional consumption of emission <b>offsets</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> EP (any amount {{up to the}} initially contracted volume is allowed), and includes a benefit-sharing mechanism between the EP and FO as it regards unused offsets. The modeling results indicated that FI-REDD might help avoid bankruptcy of CO 2 -intensive producers at high levels of CO 2 prices. We demonstrated the impact of benefit-sharing and risk preferences on the contracted REDD offsets quantity. Here, we further develop the FI-REDD model by introducing two modifications. Firstly, we add opportunity cost of the forest owner, i. e. forest value alternative to REDD. This change leads to a realistic risk-adjusted supply curves for REDD, which are generated by the indifference (fair) pricing model and calculated for all possible benefit-sharing ratios. Secondly, we introduce an uncertainty associated with acceptance (fungibility) of REDD offsets in {{the second stage of}} the model. Modeling results demonstrate in a quantitative way the impact of fungibility uncertainty and positive effects of the benefit-sharing mechanism. An optimal value of the benefit-sharing ratio can be found that guarantees contracting the highest amounts of offsets at the low equilibrium price. This qualitative feature of the benefit-sharing mechanism is robust with respect to the uncertainty parameters in the model. We also undertake an in-depth analysis of decision making of the electricity producer using 3 D visualization tools...|$|E
