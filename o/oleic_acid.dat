5|$|Fruits are {{released}} in the summer, containing about 16 seeds on average. These seeds are most typically dispersed by ants, which is called myrmecochory, but yellow jackets (Vespula vulgaris) and harvestmen (order Opiliones) have both been observed dispersing the seeds at lower frequencies. Insect dispersal is aided {{by the presence of}} a conspicuous elaiosome, an oil-rich body attached to the seed, which is high in both lipids and <b>oleic</b> <b>acid.</b> The <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> induces corpse-carrying behavior in ants, causing them to bring the seeds to their nesting sites as if they were food. As ants visit several colonies of the plant, they bring genetically variable seeds back to a single location, which after germination results in a new population with relatively high genetic diversity. This has the ultimate effect of increasing biological fitness.|$|E
5|$|Passiflora edulis Passion fruit oil is {{extracted}} from the seeds and composed mainly of linoleic acid (62%) with smaller amounts of <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> (20%) and palmitic acid (7%). It has varied applications in cosmetics manufacturing and for uses as a human or animal food.|$|E

The free fatty acid content of dried fruit bodies was 4.5%, slightly more than the common button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), which had 3.5%. The majority of this total was <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> (1.95%), followed by linoleic acid (1.68%) and palmitic acid (1.69%).|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a double bond is {{introduced into the}} fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of stearic acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces <b>oleic</b> <b>acid.</b> The doubly unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid {{as well as the}} triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} {{to determine the effect}} of graded level of concentrate 0 %, 25 %, 50 % and 75 % on the tempertuer and pH in rumen fluid, fauna and fatty acids composition of rumen protozoa in goats under feeding of wild grass. Ruminal tempertur remained high up to 50 % level of concentrate ratio. Ruminal pH decreased up to 50 % concentrate ratio. Total protozoa number was increased with feeding of concentrate level. Correlation of total protozoa number and Entodinum number was higher in positive. Content of palmitic <b>acids</b> and <b>oleic</b> <b>acids</b> of rumen porotozoa were increased with concentrate ratio. Corerlation of content of <b>oleic</b> <b>acids</b> and Epidinium number was higher in positive. These results suggest that fermentation of feed in the rumen is activates with increase of concentrate ratio. Moreone, it seems that the increase {{of the total number of}} protozoa ascribes to the number of Entodinum species and the increase of <b>oleic</b> <b>acids</b> content is due to the increase of Epidinium species...|$|R
5|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of S.brevipes fruit bodies has been analyzed. The cap contained a higher lipid content than the stipe—18.4% {{of the dry}} weight, compared to 12.4%. In the cap, linoleic acid made up 50.7% of the total lipids (65.7% in the stipe), <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> was 29.9% (12.4% in the stipe), followed by palmitic acid at 10.5% (12.6% in the stipe). Linoleic acid—a {{member of the group}} of essential fatty acids called omega-6 fatty acids—is an essential dietary requirement for humans.|$|E
5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% <b>oleic</b> <b>acid,</b> 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volatile flavour compounds of Suillellus luridus consists largely of linoleic acid, with smaller proportions of 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid methyl ester, and heptadecanoic acid. Pyrazine compounds might {{be responsible for the}} characteristic odour of the dried mushroom. The predominant sterol present in the fruit bodies is ergosterol, with smaller amounts of closely related derivative compounds. The main fatty acids of the mushroom include linoleic acid (53.4% of total fatty acids), <b>oleic</b> <b>acid</b> (24.1%), and palmitic acid (10.2%). Arginine is the free amino acid found in the highest concentration (96.9μM per gram of dry weight), followed by glutamine (9.7) and alanine (8.2).|$|E
40|$|The product {{distribution}} of Brevibacterium ammoniagenes fatty acid synthetase {{has been investigated}} using propionyl-CoA instead of acetyl-CoA as the primer. The synthetase produces not only an odd-numbered fatty acid (heptadecanoic acid) but also even-numbered fatty <b>acids</b> (stearic and <b>oleic</b> <b>acids)</b> {{in the presence of}} propionyl-CoA. The amounts of heptadecanoic, stearic and <b>oleic</b> <b>acids</b> increased with increas-ing concentration of propionyl-CoA. However, the formation of heptadecenoic acid (Ci 7 :l) was not observed under any conditions tested. The failure of C 17 !l synthesis suggested that the enzyme component catalyzing the fty-dehydration, which is responsible for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, has a high degree of chain length specificity. Under standard assay conditions, stearic acid predom-inated and heptadecanoic and <b>oleic</b> <b>acids</b> were found in lesser amounts. Mass spectrometric analyses of fatty acids synthesized either from [2 H]propionyl-CoA or in 2 H 2 O revealed that propionyl-CoA is utilized as the priming substrate for the synthesis of heptadecanoic acid and that an acetyl residues, which is formed by the decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA, served as the priming substrate for the synthese...|$|R

40|$|Polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} (PUFA) {{are known to}} repress SCD- 1 gene expression, key enzyme of {{monounsaturated}} fatty acid biosynthesis. Alterations of the monounsaturated/saturated fatty acids ratio have been implicated in various diseases related to the metabolic syndrome, including hypertension. We previously evidenced that lipogenesis end-products accumulated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and that a dietary combination of n- 6 /n- 3 PUFA had hypotensive effects. Our present objective was {{to test the hypothesis}} that these SHR liver lipid disorders might be modulated, in response to this hypotensive combination, by changes in SCD- 1 expression and activity. So we studied, in hepatocytes, SCD- 1 transcription by Northern blotting, as well as plasma and liver fatty acid composition by gas-liquid chromatography. Liver SCD- 1 gene expression was suppressed by 50 %, and in different lipid classes, relative abundance of stearic and <b>oleic</b> <b>acids</b> decreased. Consequently, the Delta 9 desaturation index, calculated from the ratio of <b>oleic</b> vs. stearic <b>acids,</b> decreased. In addition, the level of circulating saturated fatty acids decreased when one of <b>oleic</b> <b>acids</b> increased. These data provided evidence that the tested hypotensive PUFA combination reverses the high monounsaturated/saturated fatty acids ratio associated to hypertension in SHR, via a regulation monounsaturated fatty acid relative abundance by repression of SCD- 1 gene...|$|R

25|$|Older {{literature}} {{cites the}} fungus Malassezia furfur (previously known as Pityrosporum ovale) {{as the cause}} of dandruff. While this species does occur naturally on the skin surface of both healthy people and those with dandruff, in 2007 it was discovered that the responsible agent is a scalp specific fungus, Malassezia globosa, that metabolizes triglycerides present in sebum by the expression of lipase, resulting in a lipid byproduct <b>oleic</b> <b>acid.</b> During dandruff, the levels of Malassezia increase by 1.5 to 2 times its normal level. <b>Oleic</b> <b>acid</b> penetrates the top layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum, and evokes an inflammatory response in susceptible people which disturbs homeostasis and results in erratic cleavage of stratum corneum cells.|$|E
