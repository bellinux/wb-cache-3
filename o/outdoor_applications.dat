This paper focused on the possibility of using Waste Tire Dust-Polypropelene (WTD-PP) composite with Alumina Trihydrate (ATH) as the main reinforcement filler for high voltage insulation material. Compound of WTD-PP without and with ATH were prepared with different compositions of WTD-PP content and different amount of ATH filler.

40|$|Gypsum is an economy-priced {{building}} material which is particularly advantageous for the indoor application featuring {{a variety of}} positive physical properties, {{but it is not}} moisture-resistent. Thus, gypsum {{building material}}s are not suitable for <b>outdoor</b> <b>application.</b> At the Fraunhofer Institutes for Silicate- and Wood Research, Germany, a gypsum front panel was developed which is also suitable for <b>outdoor</b> <b>application.</b> One of the special feature of this panel is the multi-layer design. The carrier panel consists of a gypsum matrix containing mass hydrophobing agents and eventually reinforcing fibers. On the outside is applied a functional layer open to water vapor {{and at the same time}} imper-meable to water. A method which is wide-spread in the manufacture of modern texti-les. The functional layer consists of a glass fiber mat and an incorporated micro-poriferous structure with hydrophobic properties. The weathering resistance of the pa-nel was proved by artificial weathering in a facility for climatic simulation. The mechanical properties of the gypsum front panel are typical for gypsum. If the construction is adjusted to the panel also a static load carrying will be possible. Moreover, the panel is non-combustible and, therefore, it can be applied p. ex. in high buil-dings with special fireproofing requirement...|$|R
