40|$|This paper {{suggests}} a new visual language for describing the logical {{outline of a}} component-based system: ConCOIL extends the UML and uses two new specification techniques. On the one hand, ‘context properties’ describe dependencies between otherwise possibly unrelated model elements that share the same context. On the other hand, ‘context-based instructions’ are introduced at the design level as invariants based on context properties. They enable the developer to specify which parts of the model should not be changed throughout the lifetime of the system. Thus, they prevent the violation of important design decisions during {{the evolution of a}} system model. The context-based component <b>outline</b> <b>instruction</b> language ConCOIL consists of four layers: the global business object layer combines those business objects identified during analysis into one single, global view. The component topology layer contains the system's logical component structure. The context-based <b>outline</b> <b>instruction</b> layer describes essential design-level invariants for groups of components or business objects. The outline layer is a summary diagram showing the results...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} Associated Press {{articles}} related to {{persons with disabilities}} have appeared recently in newspapers across the country. The labels used in these articles have seldom conformed to guidelines set for reporting and writing about people with disabilities (Research and Training Center on Independent Living, 1996). Even though the American Psychological Association Publication Manual has also <b>outlined</b> <b>instructions</b> for writing about persons with disabilities, examples of inappropriate terminology still appear in related professional journals. "To address differences, every society creates descriptors to identify people who vary significantly from the norm. This process is called “labeling" (Hardman, Drew, & Egan, 1996, p. 4). The nature of these descriptors {{and how they are}} used often infer negative implications about persons with disabilities. Many of the terms used to describe persons with disabilities have evolved over time. The terms "mad" or "insane " were, at one time, used to describe individuals with a psychiatric disorder. The terms "moron " or "idiot " were used to depict individuals with mental retardation. We would no longer consider using these terms either professionally or informally. In the past five years, a number of other changes have occurred in the terminology used to describe music therapy clientele.

30|$|In conclusion, {{although}} {{not all of the}} five journals studied published articles in which equal credit was given to multiple authors, it is increasingly common in public health journals to publish articles given equal credit to multiple authors. Thus, we recommend that journals should include specific requirements regarding giving authors equal credit in the section <b>outlining</b> the <b>Instructions</b> for Authors. Academic promotion committees should strengthen the standards used to manage this practice, and a scientifically and logically valid evaluation system should be developed to promote the further refinement of this practice. International institutions, such as the ICMJE, World Association of Medical Editors (WAME), and COPE should provide relevant guidelines for use by scholars and journal editors.|$|R

An intelligent cruise control system fitted in a Nissan Primera was tested on the road over a 2 -week period by 10 drivers, eight of which were experts in road safety. Most test-drives were conducted on motorways during dry weather. Before driving the car, the drivers had to read the instructions concerning ACC from the handbook. The test drivers completed a survey form {{on the quality of}} the ACC system, the usability of the ACC on different road types and traffic conditions and the perceived increase or decrease of accident risk.
