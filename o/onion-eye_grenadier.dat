50|$|Macrourus berglax, the roughhead {{grenadier}} or <b>onion-eye</b> <b>grenadier,</b> is {{a species of}} marine ray-finned fish in the family Macrouridae. It is a deep-water fish found in the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
50|$|Because {{little was}} known about the {{biodiversity}} of the New England Seamount Chain, an expedition was mounted in 2000. The NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service deep water research vessel R/V Delaware II made 20 exploratory trawls {{in the vicinity of}} Bear Seamount and around 274 species were collected. These included 115 species of fish, some of which were rare or had not been recorded in the western North Atlantic before. The roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris) and the <b>onion-eye</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Macrourus berglax) were the only fish species of potential commercial importance - they were caught in mid-water at depths of between 1100 and 1800 m and were up to a metre in length. A common but much smaller fish was Aldrovandia phalacra.|$|E
50|$|The roughhead {{grenadier}} can reach {{a length of}} one metre (yard). The head occupies about {{one quarter of the}} total length of the fish and it has a slender body and long tapering tail. There are some bony spiny scutes or scales on the upper side of the head but the lower side is scaleless. The snout is pointed and the small mouth is set far back on the lower side of the head with a short barbel underneath. There are 3 to 5 rows of sharp teeth in the upper jaw and 1 or 2 rows in the lower jaw. The eye is large and bulbous, giving the fish its alternative name of <b>onion-eye</b> <b>grenadier.</b> There are two dorsal fins, the front one having 11 to 13 finrays and the hind one running along the back to the tip of the tail. The anal fin is similarly long and narrow and there is no tailfin. The body is covered in large ridged, spiny scales. The general body colour is grey, darker underneath, with dark fins and dark edges to some of the scales.|$|E
