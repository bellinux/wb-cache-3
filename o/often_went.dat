He remained active, however; he took walks through parks near his home and on beaches, played golf regularly, and until 1999 he <b>often</b> <b>went</b> to his office in nearby Century City.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{population in}} towns near the Everglades hunted in the area. Raccoons and otters {{were the most}} widely hunted for their skins. Hunting <b>often</b> <b>went</b> unchecked; in one trip, a Lake Okeechobee hunter killed 250alligators and 172otters. Water birds were a particular target of plume hunting. Bird feathers were used in women's hats in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women {{during the}} war {{presented}} men not wearing military uniform with white feathers (symbolising cowardice). This campaign <b>often</b> <b>went</b> awry, {{as many of the}} men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the Rhodesia Herald and other newspapers began publishing lists of men who had volunteered only to be deemed medically unfit by the army doctors.|$|E

5|$|Australia's lower order batted the {{tourists}} into {{control on the}} second morning. Despite the loss of Lindwall for 15 at 8/275, Tallon kept on batting in a conventional manner, supported by Johnston and Ernie Toshack, who scored their highest Test scores. Both tail-enders threw the bat at the ball, which <b>often</b> <b>went</b> in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Tallon put on 45 with Johnstonwho scored 29 before holing out for 53. Ending at 350, the Australians had regained the momentum, taking 92 runs from 66 minutes of hitting in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his artistic}} talents, Kim's main {{interest}} was medicine, and {{he applied for}} entrance into medical school upon graduation {{from high school in}} 1940. When he failed to gain admittance, Kim moved to Japan, planning to study and save up money to reapply for medical school. The theater and cinema grew into lifetime interests at this time. Kim <b>often</b> <b>went</b> to Kyoto, where he attended many stage productions and saw many international films. Josef von Sternberg's Morocco (1930) and Fritz Lang's M (1931) made a particularly strong impression on him, and their influence was to show in his mature film style.|$|E

When Lazare was two years of age, his mother moved to France to earn a better living.

5|$|In 371, the Emperor Valens split Cappadocia {{into two}} new provinces, Cappadocia Prima and Cappadocia Secunda. This {{resulted}} in complex changes in ecclesiastical boundaries, during which several new bishoprics were created. Gregory was elected {{bishop of the}} new see of Nyssa in 372, presumably {{with the support of}} his brother Basil, who was metropolitan of Caesarea. Gregory's early policies as bishop <b>often</b> <b>went</b> against those of Basil : for instance, while his brother condemned the Sabellianist followers of Marcellus of Ancyra as heretics, Gregory may have tried to reconcile them with the church.|$|E
5|$|Isabella and John Sigismund left Transylvania on 6August 1551, {{accompanied}} by Péter Petrovics. They settled in Kassa (now Košice in Slovakia), {{and moved to}} Opole in March 1552. Realizing that the Silesian duchies were poor, they left for Poland {{before the end of}} April. During the following years they lived in Kraków, Warsaw, Sanok, and other Polish towns. John Sigismund <b>often</b> <b>went</b> hunting for bison and regularly visited his uncle, Sigismund II Augustus, King of Poland. However, his health was delicate because he suffered from epilepsy and chronic intestinal disorders.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} two seasons, Jones {{developed}} into a star flanker, a position he helped invent. He was both a running threat and a receiver – his tall stature was well-suited to receiving – and helped complement a passing attack that featured the Browns' two main ends, Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie. Jones <b>often</b> <b>went</b> in motion behind {{the line of scrimmage}} before the snap at a time when few players did so, causing confusion and mismatches on defense. He had 312 rushing yards and 241 receiving yards in 1949, when the Browns won another AAFC championship.|$|E

5|$|Stewart {{spent the}} next two years working in Russia as a tutor, {{teaching}} English. He learned the Russian language and wrote a book describing his experiences and the country, Provincial Russia. Returning to England, he took up an appointment as Assistant Lecturer in Classics at the University of Liverpool. In 1912, he accepted a professorship teaching classics at Canterbury College, in Christchurch, New Zealand. At the college, later to become the University of Canterbury, he acquired a reputation for his energy and wit. In his leisure time, he <b>often</b> <b>went</b> climbing in the Southern Alps.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of calendars between {{the start of}} the Reformation and the 20th century were quite minimal in their commemorations. Most included events such as the Annunciation or persons such as Saint Paul, these days <b>often</b> <b>went</b> unobserved despite scrupulous attention to the temporal cycle. Even further, the commemoration of some biblical persons of note (including the Virgin Mary) were often omitted entirely. During the 20th century, especially at the instigation of the liturgical movement, familiar saints began make a reemergence onto the calendar, along with newer names and events.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} {{other areas of}} South Australia, and Australia as a whole, {{settlers}} on the frontier employed various tactics to deal with Aboriginal resistance to being forced off their traditional lands. Initially, these revolved around keeping them at a distance using threats of violence, but they soon escalated to terrorising Aboriginal people to stop them interfering with stock and other property, tactics which sometimes included violent clashes. Violence by settlers towards Aboriginal people <b>often</b> <b>went</b> unreported to the authorities, and became more secretive after a settler was hanged in March 1847 for murdering an Aboriginal man in the south east of the colony, the only such sentence {{in the history of}} South Australia's early white settlement. This frontier violence has been described as an undeclared and covert war between settlers and Aboriginal people.|$|E

5|$|In the Second Test at Lord's, Australia batted {{first and}} Johnston scored his Test career best of 29 in another tail-wagging {{performance}} in the first innings. After coming to the crease with the score at 8/275 on the second morning, Johnston added 45 runs with wicket-keeper Don Tallon before the latter fell to Bedser. He was joined by last man Toshack and they put on 30 before Johnston was stumpedhaving overbalanced while leaning onto the front foot and trying to hit a ball for sixfrom the bowling of Doug Wright to end Australia's innings at 350. Both Johnston and Toshack threw the bat at the ball, which <b>often</b> <b>went</b> in vastly different directions compared to where they had aimed their shots. Both mennot known for their batting abilityplayed without inhibitions, joyfully revelling in their luck. One sequence of two overs from Edrich was taken for 28 runs, with many balls being unintentionally spooned over the slips or the covers.|$|E
5|$|Metal armour was {{of limited}} {{use in the}} hot, wet {{tropical}} climate. It was heavy {{and had to be}} constantly cleaned to prevent rusting; in direct sunlight, metal armour became unbearably hot. Conquistadores <b>often</b> <b>went</b> without metal armour, or only donned it immediately prior to battle. They were quick to adopt quilted cotton armour based upon that used by their native opponents, and commonly combined this {{with the use of a}} simple metal war hat. Shields were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry; generally this was a circular target shield, convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood. Rings secured it to the arm and hand.|$|E
5|$|Nadanian {{was born}} on 19 September 1972 in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, which then {{was part of the}} Soviet Union, to Sergei and Irina, both hairdressers. He was taught to play chess by his father when he was seven. His early coach was Rafael Sarkisov, who took him on as a pupil at Spartak in Baku. In his article The Voiceless Old Man Nadanian recollects, that when he was nine or ten there were almost no chess tournaments in which young players could play with seniors and {{therefore}} he <b>often</b> <b>went</b> to the park near his house to play chess with older chess lovers. He remembers that in one of these park-battles he played against a mysterious, silent stranger {{who turned out to be}} the highly respected chess champion Vladimir Makogonov. In 1986 and 1987 Nadanian won the under-sixteen Azerbaijani championship. With the beginning of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1988, his family was forced to leave Baku and flee to Armenia.|$|E

5|$|The idea of Jesse riding go-karts {{by himself}} to relax was {{inspired}} by Aaron Paul and other crew members who <b>often</b> <b>went</b> kart racing between filming of Breaking Bad episodes in Albuquerque, New Mexico. During one of the party scenes at Jesse's house, Jesse keeps throwing crumpled dollar bills {{at the mouth of}} a sleeping man wearing a dress shirt and tie with no pants until he finally gets one inside his mouth. Catlin thought of the idea, and it was property master Trina Siopy actually throwing the bills off-screen; she got one into the actor's mouth on her second try. The scenes in Jesse's house were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy.|$|E
5|$|The royal touch (also {{known as}} the king's touch) {{was a form of}} laying on of hands, whereby French and English monarchs touched their subjects, {{regardless}} of social classes, with the intent to cure them of various diseases and conditions. The thaumaturgic touch was most commonly applied to people suffering from tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis (better known as scrofula or the King's Evil), and exclusively to them from the 16th century onwards. The disease rarely resulted in death and <b>often</b> <b>went</b> into remission on its own, giving the impression that the monarch's touch cured it. The claimed power was most notably exercised by monarchs who sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of their reign and of their newly founded dynasties.|$|E
5|$|Australia won the toss and batted {{first in}} the Second Test at Lord's. They were on the back foot at 7/258 at stumps on the first day. On the second morning, the Australian lower order counter-attacked; Toshack joined Johnston with the score at 9/320 and they put on 30 runs before Johnston was stumped. Australia regained the momentum, adding 92 runs in 66 minutes of hitting in the morning. One {{sequence}} of two overs from Edrich was taken for 28 runs, with many balls unintentionally spooned over the slips or the covers. Both players swung wildly at the ball, which <b>often</b> <b>went</b> in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Both made new Test best scores; Toshack scored 20 not out. Both Johnston and Toshack—not known for their batting ability—played without inhibitions, joyfully revelling in their luck. England were then bowled out for 215. Toshack was wicketless, but was the most economical of the bowlers, conceding only 23 runs from his 18 overs. Toshack operated after the first new ball was taken, and as England had fallen to 4/46, they played him cautiously {{in an attempt to}} rebuild the innings. Australia then declared at 7/460 in their second innings with Toshack not required to bat, leaving England a target of 596.|$|E
