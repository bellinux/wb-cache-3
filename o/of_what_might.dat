5|$|In 1990 Northern Irish poet Paul Muldoon {{published}} his long poem Madoc: a Mystery, inspired by Southey's {{work and the}} events surrounding it. Muldoon's work takes as its premise the idea that Southey and Coleridge actually came to America to found their ideal state, and offers a multi-layered poetic exploration <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have happened. It won the 1992 Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize.|$|E
5|$|Manne's {{heavy load}} of Hollywood studio work {{sometimes}} shifted his attention from his mainstream jazz playing. Even in lackluster films, however, he nevertheless often {{succeeded in making}} art <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be called hackwork. Still, for all his tireless work in the studios, Manne's labor of love was his contribution to jazz as an American art form, {{to which he had}} dedicated himself since his youth and continued to work at almost to the last day of his life.|$|E

It also includes prognosis, an awareness <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> happen next. That includes on the one hand an awareness both <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> occur based on diagnosis and the current situation, {{and on the other hand}} on an awareness of current plans and intentions.|$|E
25|$|At the 2008 Paris Motor Show, Lamborghini {{revealed}} the Estoque, a four-door sedan concept. Although {{there had been}} much speculation regarding the Estoque's eventual production, Lamborghini management has not made a decision regarding production <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be the first four-door car to roll out of the Sant'Agata factory.|$|E
25|$|The {{resurgence}} of feminist activism {{in the late}} 1960s was accompanied by an emerging literature <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be considered female-associated issues, such as concerns for the earth, spirituality, and environmental activism. The atmosphere this created reignited the study of and debate on matricentricity as a rejection of determinism, such as with Adrienne Rich in Of Woman Born and Marilyn French in Beyond Power. For socialist feminists like Evelyn Reed, patriarchy held the properties of capitalism.|$|E

25|$|Shaffer was {{inspired}} to write Equus when he heard of a crime involving a 17-year-old who blinded six horses {{in a small town}} near Suffolk. He set out to construct a fictional account <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have caused the incident, without knowing any of the details of the crime. The play's action is something of a detective story, involving the attempts of the child psychiatrist Dr. Martin Dysart to understand the cause of the boy's actions while wrestling with his own sense of purpose.|$|E
25|$|In Henry's suite, {{he realizes}} {{that things are going}} too fast, and afraid <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> happen, he sneaks out and heads back to his house in the suburbs. Upon his return to their home, he is upset by the fact that Helen is not at home. In Helen's suite, she is {{confused}} by the effect that McKenzie's attention is having on her. Putting him off, she tells him that she will give him an answer in the morning. After he leaves, she is afraid of her feelings, and she heads back to her home. After she arrives, she and Henry realize that the two really love each other, and they reconcile.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 Corvette chief {{engineer}} Zora Arkus-Duntov initiated {{a program to}} produce a lightweight version based on a prototype that mirrored the new 1963 Corvette. Concerned about Ford {{and what they were}} doing with the Shelby Cobra, Duntov's program included plans to build 125 examples of the Corvette Grand Sport to allow the model to be homologated for international Grand Touring races. After the GM executives learned of the secret project, the program was stopped, and only five cars were built. All five cars have survived and are in private collections. They are among the most coveted and valuable Corvettes ever built, not because of what they accomplished, but because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have been.|$|E

25|$|Regarding Sophoniba, {{her story}} {{provides}} {{a perspective on}} the rivalry between the two kings, Syphax of Masaesyli (west Numidia) and Masinissa of Massyli (east Numidia). Her story also sheds light {{on the relationship between}} Carthage and the Berbers, with particular reference to Rome. Livy (59 BC–AD 17), the Roman historian, presents a rather detailed portrait of these circumstances, especially events following the defeat of her husband Syphax. Such details may shed light on the personality of Masinissa, or at least on the world in which he lived. Yet ancient historians were not unfamiliar with propaganda and their readers expected them to recreate scenes, giving memorable, probable versions <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have happened.|$|E
25|$|Still {{operating}} as a Missouri militia general (rather {{than as a}} commissioned Confederate officer), Price was unable to agree with his Wilson's Creek colleague, Brigadier General Benjamin McCulloch, {{as to how to}} proceed following the battle; this led to the splitting <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> otherwise have become a sizable Confederate force in the West. Price and McCulloch became bitter rivals, leading to the ultimate appointment of Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn as overall commander of the Trans-Mississippi district. Van Dorn reunited Price's and McCulloch's formations into a force he named the Army of the West, and set out to engage Unionist troops in Missouri under the command of Brig. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis. Now under Van Dorn's command, Price was commissioned in the Confederate States Army as a major general on March 6, 1862.|$|E
500|$|Throughout much of 2007, Clinton and Giuliani led in {{national}} polls for their parties' respective nominations, and media reports often {{looked back to}} the 2000 [...] "race that wasn't" [...] as a preview <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> lie in wait for the entire nation in 2008. [...] Such extrapolating ended with the Giuliani campaign's precipitous decline and January 2008 withdrawal. Clinton as well failed to gain the 2008 nomination and, in June 2008, she finished in a close second place to Illinois Senator Barack Obama.|$|E

500|$|Concerns that {{defamation}} under {{common law}} might be {{incompatible with the}} new republican form of government caused early American courts to struggle between William Blackstone's argument that the punishment of [...] "dangerous or offensive writings [...] [...] [...] [...] necessary {{for the preservation of}} peace and good order, of government and religion, the only solid foundations of civil liberty" [...] and the argument that the need for a free press guaranteed by the Constitution outweighed the fear <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be written. Consequently, very few changes were made in the first two centuries after the ratification of the First Amendment.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the focus}} {{in this essay}} is largely on the {{character}} of Prince Hamlet, Hazlitt also comments on the movement of the dramatic action. Shakespeare lends all the characters and settings an air of verisimilitude, so that the reader might consider [...] "the whole play [...] an exact transcription <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be supposed to have taken place at the court of Denmark, at the remote period of time fixed upon, before the modern refinements in morals and manners were heard of. [...] the characters think and speak and act just as they might do, if left entirely to themselves. There is no set purpose, no straining at a point." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} 33 years, {{the fate of}} the {{expedition}} was shrouded in mystery and its disappearance part of cultural lore in Sweden and to a certain extent elsewhere. It was actively sought {{for a couple of years}} and remained the subject of myth and rumor, with frequent international newspaper reports of possible findings. An extensive archive of American newspaper reports from the first few years, 1896–99, titled [...] "The Mystery of Andree", shows a much richer media interest in the expedition after it disappeared than before. A great variety of fates are suggested for it, inspired by finds, or reported finds, of remnants <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be a balloon basket, or great amounts of balloon silk, or by stories of men falling from the sky, or visions by psychics, all of which would typically locate the stranded balloon far from Danes Island and Svalbard.|$|E

500|$|The creators started {{brainstorming}} {{possibilities for}} the short film in June 2014. After early discussions about Olaf, head story artist Marc Smith [...] pitched the idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> happen if Elsa had a cold, which {{became the basis for}} the short's plot. The directors began working on the short in June and by August were back in the recording studio with the cast to lay down vocal tracks. The production of Frozen Fever took six months. All of the animators from Frozen wanted to come back to animate at least one shot on Frozen Fever, resulting in a large number of animator credits for a short film. They struggled to squeeze the animation phase of the short's production into a tight time slot in fall 2014 after animation wrapped on Big Hero 6 and before the studio's animators had to start working on subsequent features.|$|E
500|$|We {{as readers}} or {{audience}} appreciate the characters {{by the force}} of our imagination's seeming to participate in the scene, as if we were present during such an event in real life. Commenting on the scene in Julius Caesar where Caesar confides to Marc Antony his apprehensions about Cassius, Hazlitt writes: [...] "We know hardly any passage more expressive of the genius of Shakespeare than this. It is {{as if he had been}} actually present, had known the different characters and what they thought of one another, and had taken down what he heard and saw, their looks, words, and gestures, just as they happened." [...] In [...] "Hamlet", he observes that [...] "the characters think and speak and act just as they might do, if left entirely to themselves. [...] The whole play is an exact transcript <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be supposed to have taken place at the court of Denmark [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Could Fall in Love" [...] {{received}} a generally positive response from music critics, who commented on its similarities to songs recorded by other artists. Ed Morales of Vibe magazine felt that, {{because of its}} syncopated drums, [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] had a [...] "Jon Secada-like feel", and it reminded Tarradell of songs recorded by American singer Brandy Norwood and by the trio TLC. An editor from the Star-News thought the song had [...] "a whiff of" [...] Celine Dion. James Hunter, also from Vibe, praised Selena's astute interpretation, calling it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and commenting that Selena's death made the track more difficult to listen to. Larry Flick of Billboard described [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] as an [...] "optimistic love song" [...] that left [...] "melancholy thoughts <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have been" [...] {{in the mind of}} the listener. John Lannert, also from Billboard, conceived [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] as a [...] "sensuous narrative" [...] recording and a [...] "seductive romantic confessional". Tarradell, writing in The Beaver County Times, called it a [...] "crossover staple".|$|E
