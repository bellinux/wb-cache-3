60|$|If it was {{the object}} of Lord BYRON to stamp his character, and to bring his name forward by a single act of his life into general notoriety, it must be confessed that he has {{completely}} succeeded. We do not recollect any former instance in which a Peer has stood forth as the libeller of his Sovereign. If he disapproves the measures of his Ministers, the House of Parliament, {{in which he has}} an hereditary right to sit, is the place where his opinions may with propriety be uttered. If he thinks he can avert any danger to his country by a personal conference with his Sovereign, he has a right to demand it. The Peers are the natural advisers of the Crown, but the Constitution which has granted them such extraordinary privileges, makes it doubly criminal in them to attack the authority from which it is derived, and to insult the power which it is their peculiar province to uphold and protect. What then must we think of the foolish vanity, or the bad taste of a titled Poet, who is the first to proclaim himself the Author of a Libel, because he is fearful it will not be sufficiently read without his avowal. We perfectly remember having read the verses in question a year ago; but we could not then suppose them the offspring of patrician bile, nor should we now believe it without the Author's special authority. It seems by some late quotations from his Lordship's works, which have been rescued from that oblivion to which they were hastening with a rapid step, by one of our co-equals, that this peerless Peer has already gone through a complete course of private ingratitude. The inimitable Hogarth has traced the gradual workings of an unfeeling heart in his progress of cruelty. He has shewn, that malevolence is progressive in its operation, and that a man who begins life by impaling flies, will find a delight in torturing his fellow creatures before he closes it. We have heard that even at school these poetical propensities were strongly manifested in Lord BYRON, and that he began his satirical career against those persons to whom the formation of his mind was entrusted. From his schoolmaster he turned the <b>oestrum</b> of his opening genius to his guardian and uncle, the Earl of CARLISLE. We cannot believe that the Noble Person's conduct has in this instance been a perfect contrast to the general tenor of his life. We have heard, that during his guardianship he tripled the amount of his nephew's fortune. If the Earl of CARLISLE was satisfied with his own 'conscia mens recti', if he wanted no thanks, he must at least have been much surprised to find such attentions and services rewarded with a libel, in which not only his literary accomplishments, but his bodily infirmities, were made the subject of public ridicule. The Noble Earl was certainly at liberty to treat such personal attacks with the contempt which they deserve, but since his Sovereign is become the object of a vile and unprovoked libel, he will no doubt draw the attention of his Peers to a new case of outrage to good order and government, which has been unfortunately furnished by his own nephew.|$|E

The new species is of small size, has a cephalon that is little immersed in pereonite 1, anterolateral angles of pereonite 1 that reach or surpass {{the eyes and}} a pleon that is deeply immersed in pereonite 7. The pleopods of the new species have small, lobular accessory gills projecting from the bases. Cymothoa excisa Perty, 1830, and Cymothoa <b>oestrum</b> (Linnaeus, 1758) are redescribed. Both are of large size (25 - 35 mm in length). C. excisa has pointed anterolateral margins of pereonite 1 that reach or surpass the eyes. This species also has trilaminate pleopods in the female and bilaminate pleopods in the male. C. <b>oestrum</b> has rounded anterolateral margins of pereonite 1 and no visible eyes.

40|$|The {{parasitic}} isopod fauna of fishes in {{the southern}} Caribbean is poorly known. In examinations of 12 639 specimens of 187 species of Venezuelan fishes, the authors found 10 species in three families of isopods (Gnathiids, Gnathia spp. from Diplectrum radiale *, Heteropriacanthus cruentatus *, Orthopristis ruber * and Trachinotus carolinus *; two aegids, Rocinela signata from Dasyatis guttata *, H. cruentatus *, Haemulon aurolineatum *, H. steindachneri * and O. ruber; and Rocinela sp. from Epinephelus flavolimbatus *; five cymothoids: Anilocra haemuli from Haemulon boschmae *, H. flavolineatum * and H. steindachneri *; Anilocra cf haemuli from Heteropriacanthus cruentatus *; Haemulon bonariense*, O. ruber*, Cymothoa excisa in H. cruentatus *; Cymothoa <b>oestrum</b> in Chloroscombrus chrysurus, H. cruentatus* and Priacanthus arenatus; Cymothoa sp. in O. ruber; Livoneca sp. from H. cruentatus *; and Nerocila fluviatilis from H. cruentatus * and P. arenatus *). The Rocinela sp. and A. cf haemuli {{in the southern}} Caribbean could represent new species. The abundance of A. cf haemuli appears to have drastically reduced from 1994 to 1999 in the Gulf of Cariaco. The Cymothoa sp. represents an undescribed species that is apparently host specific to O. ruber. It does not occur in the Gulf of Cariaco, but is relatively abundant on the Caribbean coast of Sucre State, Venezuela. The Livoneca sp. is an undescribed species host specific to Diapterus rhombeus, Cymothoa excisa and C. <b>oestrum</b> were thought to have distinct host preferences, but both infected the Heteropriacanthus cruentatus in the present study. Gnathia spp. are reported from Venezuelan waters for the first time. Twenty new host records* are noted.

40|$|Cymothoa spinipalpa sp. nov. (Isopoda, Cymothoidae) a {{buccal cavity}} {{parasite}} {{of the marine}} fish, Oligoplites saurus, is described {{on the basis of}} eight male specimens and one female. The fish hosts were captured in the coastal waters of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil. In the new species, the anterior margin of the cephalon is doubled ventrally over the bases of the antennae. In this respect, it resembles C. recifea Thatcher & Fonseca, 2005. It differs from that species, however, in being much smaller and having basal carinae on the pereopods 4 to 7 that are small and rounded (not large and pointed). Also, pleopods 2 - 4 lack the folds and pockets that are present in C. recifea. The new species can be distinguished from all known Cymothoa spp. by the mandibular palps which are entirely covered with small spines in adult males. The mancas of the new species resemble those of Cymothoa <b>oestrum</b> since they have elongate antennae but they are wider and have shorter uropods. Cymothoa spinipalpa sp. nov.

40|$|Os cruzamentos na ovinocultura tornaram-se um importante instrumento para aumentar a velocidade de crescimento dos animais e incrementar os parâmetros reprodutivo, sendo justificadas as pesquisas que gere tecnologias. Objetivou-se, com o presente trabalho, comparar a prolificidade e a fertilidade, de ovelhas Santa Inês (SI) cruzados com as raças Dorper (DP) e Somalis Brasileira (SB). A pesquisa foi conduzida no Campo Experimental Pedro Arle, da Embrapa Tabuleiros Costeiros/SE. Foram utilizadas 95 ovelhas da raça SI com idade variando de dois a sete anos e peso médio de 45, 3 kg, criadas em regime semi-intensivo. As fêmeas foram inseminadas por laparoscopia (IL) com sêmen congelado de dois reprodutores das raças DP, SB e SI, formando assim três grupos genéticos: GG 1 : SI x SI, GG 2 : DP x SI e GG 3 : SB x SI. Observou-se que não houve associação entre taxa de fertilidade ao parto e o tipo de acasalamento, obtendo-se taxa média de 43, 16 %. A prolificidade média foi de 1, 19, não apresentando diferença significativa (P> 0, 05) entre grupos genéticos. Com base nos resultados, conclui-se que as ovelhas SI apresentaram razoável taxa de fertilidade ao parto, quando submetidas à Inseminação Artificial Laparoscópica em nível de campo, com indução do estro apenas pelo efeito macho; o efeito da heterose sobre a prolificidade pode ser desprezível.

Abstract - Interbreedings from the sheep raising {{become an important}} means to increase the rapidity of animals growth and even increase reproductive parameters, the searches have been justified for the technological. Advanced development the actual performance considered to confer the prolification and the fertility sheep Santa Snês breed (SI) interbred with the Dorper (DP) and Somalis Brazilian breeds (SB). The search was conduced at experimental rural rustic camp denominated Pedro Arle, to belong to Embrapa Tabuleiros Costeiros/SE. It were utilized ninety five sheeps of the SI breed with age between from two to seven ages and 45, 3 medium weight, they were breeding in a half-active regime. The females were inseminated by laparoscopia (IL) with frozen semen that belongs reproducers of the DP, SB and SI breeds, producing in this manner three genetical groups: GG 1 : SI x SI, GG 2 : DP x SI and GG 3 : SB x SI. So it was understood that there wasn´t any association between the fertility parturition rate in comparison to mating type, obtaining consequently a medium rate of 43, 16 %. The prolification average was 1, 19, it didn´t present any significative diference (p> 0, 05) among to geneticals groups. Basing at these results, it has been concluded that the SI sheeps showed reasonable fertlility rate for the artificial insemination laparoscopic in search level, with induction <b>oestrum</b> only by effect male animal; contrasting the heterose effect and prolification can be worthless. 200...|$|E
40|$|The ferret fits in {{immediately}} {{with its new}} environment as regards its sexual cycle, when taken from the northern to the southern hemisphere. The animals that were in anoestrum in England started breeding shortly after they arrived in South Africa - the last litters being born the 22 nd March, 1938. Females may be stimulated to show oestrus, even where the light is decreasing, {{after the birth of}} a litter or after they have suckled their young for some time. A female may even remain in <b>oestrum</b> throughout the winter. There is, however, a big variation in the reaction of different females. Some females that had litters during December did not show oestrus again during that season while other females still came on heat as late as the end of April after their young had been weaned. Fertile matings appeared to occur only until the end of January or the first week in February. A few matings occurred after this date, but no young were produced. The earliest that a litter has been produced is the 6 th September. This female was served on the 27 th July, 1940, so that litters have been obtained from September to March inclusive. The breeding season at Onderstepoort, therefore, appears to be about 1 to 2 months longer than in Europe. Young males, born during the previous season, will copulate and are fertile about a month earlier than older males. When females commence to come on heat toward the middle of July, only young males will sense them. The average litter size of those in which one and more have been reared is 6 • 0 young per litter and 5 • 7 in those litters of which all the young were destroyed. If females are served immediately after their vulvas start to swell, then the average litter size is only 3, which is half the normal. The average litter size of the previous litters of these females was 9, so that early service can reduce the litter size to half or a third the normal size. Up to the end of November only 10 young out of 177 were reared. From December there was an improvement. It appears that the months September, October and November have an adverse influence on the mothers and probably on the young as well. This is substantiated by the results obtained with rats over a period of 4 years. During {{this time of the year}} the survival rate is the lowest and those that did survive grew at a slower rate and did not reach the same mature weights as those born during the favourable time of the year. Experience during the last two years indicates that there is very little advantage in breeding ferrets before November, although they commence to come on heat 3 months earlier. Rats born during June and July have done very well. Therefore it is intended to try out the practicability of electric lighting for large scale breeding and probably injecting only the males with pregnant mare serum after they had been exposed to the extra light for some time.
