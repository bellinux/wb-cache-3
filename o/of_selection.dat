30|$|For data applications, {{the numbers}} <b>of</b> <b>selections</b> <b>of</b> UMTS and LTE by Algorithms  1 – 3 are {{relatively}} close, {{and they also}} choose WLAN and WiMAX for {{a certain number of}} times, thus causing more handovers. The network most selected by Algorithms  4 – 6 is WLAN, followed by UMTS, with the number <b>of</b> <b>selections</b> <b>of</b> LTE and WiMAX being very small. Therefore, in a data application, Algorithms  4 – 6 reduce more switching times for Algorithms  1 – 3, respectively.|$|R

5|$|A {{population}} bottleneck is when {{a population}} contracts to a significantly smaller size over {{a short period of}} time due to some random environmental event. In a true population bottleneck, the odds for survival of any member of the population are purely random, and are not improved by any particular inherent genetic advantage. The bottleneck can result in radical changes in allele frequencies, completely independent <b>of</b> <b>selection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Advocates {{for higher}} levels <b>of</b> <b>selection</b> (such as Richard Lewontin, David Sloan Wilson, and Elliott Sober) {{suggest that there}} are many {{phenomena}} (including altruism) that gene-based selection cannot satisfactorily explain. The philosopher Mary Midgley, with whom Dawkins clashed in print concerning The Selfish Gene, has criticised gene selection, memetics, and sociobiology as being excessively reductionist; she has suggested that the popularity of Dawkins's work is due to factors in the Zeitgeist such as the increased individualism of the Thatcher/Reagan decades.|$|E

5|$|At {{various times}} during the program, NASA {{managers}} and personnel found themselves limited in terms of resources and manpower, particularly as Phase Two geared up, and {{had a hard time}} getting anywhere with NASA administration. One particular area of contention was with crew assignments to missions. Many astronauts allege that the method <b>of</b> <b>selection</b> prevented the most skilled people from performing roles they were best-suited for.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act {{at different}} levels of organisation, such as genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and species. Selection can act at multiple levels simultaneously. An example <b>of</b> <b>selection</b> occurring below the level of the individual organism are genes called transposons, which can replicate and spread throughout a genome. Selection at a level above the individual, such as group selection, may allow the evolution of cooperation, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{will only}} cause evolution {{if there is}} enough genetic variation in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was blending inheritance. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The Hardy–Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant in the absence <b>of</b> <b>selection,</b> mutation, migration and genetic drift.|$|E

5|$|Pet {{birds are}} kept in their millions, as are {{domestic}} fowls, bantams, and pigeons.

5|$|Upon the {{resumption}} of competitive cricket, Tallon's chances <b>of</b> <b>selection</b> had improved due to the fates of his pre-war wicket-keeping rivals. Oldfield had long retired. Barnett, a captain in the army, had been a prisoner of the Japanese at Changi in Singapore for four years. Emaciated, he slowly recovered his fitness and forced his {{way back into the}} Victorian team, but was almost 40 and intended to retire in the near future. Walker had joined the Royal Australian Air Force as a gunner and was killed in a duel with Nazi fighter pilots over Soltau in Germany. This left Tallon as the front-runner, but there was a possibility that the selectors would opt for generational change and install a more youthful keeper like Gil Langley or Ron Saggers with an eye to the future. With the pressure <b>of</b> <b>selection</b> on his head, Tallon made eight dismissals in the first match after {{the resumption}} of cricket, against New South Wales in Brisbane, including three stumpings and three catches from the leg spin of Colin McCool, a future Test team-mate. The performance was to herald the start of a prolific bowler-wicket-keeper partnership. Tallon then scored 74 to guide Queensland to the target of 270 with four wickets in hand. Queensland won two of their seven matches and Tallon scored 305 runs at 30.50 and completed 27 dismissals to finally gain national selection.|$|E
5|$|Very rarely, {{female worker}} bees lay eggs that escape worker policing, {{in a process}} known as the anarchic syndrome. Female {{reproductive}} workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even {{in the presence of a}} queen. The worker eggs are allowed as they mimic queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can maximize their reproductive fitness at the expense of the colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example <b>of</b> <b>selection</b> working in opposite directions at individual and group levels.|$|E
