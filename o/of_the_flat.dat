5|$|Be Reasonable is {{a monthly}} {{interview}} show that engages guests with ideas {{outside the mainstream}} scientific consensus, such as a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flat</b> Earth Society. In the first episode, on 28 January 2013, hosts Hayley Stevens (until June 2014) and Michael Marshall described the show as an examination of their guests' beliefs and their structure, and the evidence they believe supports these beliefs. Guests have discussed past life therapy, aura photography {{and the presence of}} aliens on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Carboniferous Period (359–299 {{million years}} ago) rocks are {{represented}} by the Carboniferous Limestone that forms the Mendip Hills, rising abruptly out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> landscape of the Somerset Levels and Moors. The limestones are very fossiliferous, and contain evidence of the abundant marine life that existed {{at the time of}} their creation, including fossil crinoids (sea-lilies), corals and brachiopods.|$|E
5|$|Irving's {{writings}} on Columbus are {{a mixture of}} history and fiction, a genre now called romantic history. Irving based them on extensive research in the Spanish archives, but also added imaginative elements aimed at sharpening the story. The first of these works {{is the source of}} the durable myth that medieval Europeans believed the Earth was flat. (See Myth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> earth.) According to the popular book, Columbus proved the Earth was round.|$|E
50|$|Following control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> council passing to the Labour party <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> {{demolition}} {{decision for}} four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> was reviewed, {{with a report}} in 2012 recommending <b>the</b> demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> (Gorthorpe, Kinthorpe, Laxthorpe, and Highcourt). In mid 2012 the council decided to refurbish two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> (Gorthorpe, and Kinthorpe) due to demand for housing, and demolish the others.|$|R
40|$|The design {{concept and}} {{configuration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flatbed</b> transport aircraft are presented. <b>The</b> <b>Flatbed</b> configuration combines into one frame, {{the ability to}} haul cargo, virtually unrestrained by cross sectional dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage. The feasibility and capability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flatbed</b> is discussed in depth...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{hydrology}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kafue River and Kafue Flats {{have been}} significantly altered by the construction in <b>the</b> 1970s <b>of</b> two dams, firstly at Kafue Gorge downstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> {{and then at}} Itezhi-Tezhi upstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> as parts <b>of</b> a scheme to generate hydroelectric power.|$|R
5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E
5|$|The species favours lowland {{areas that}} are {{seasonally}} wet but never inundated, such as the margins of swamps and marshes. For example, in the Yule Brook Botany Reserve, where parallel sand ridges cross a clay flat, B.telmatiaea occurs neither in the lowest parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat,</b> where seasonal inundation occurs; nor {{on the tops of}} the ridges, where the drainage is good; but {{it is one of the}} most abundant plants of intermediate habitats, on ridge slopes and in higher areas of the clay flat.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic {{reptiles}} {{with long}} snouts and {{large numbers of}} teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates {{from side to side}} to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> head enabling them to remain above {{the surface of the water}} when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|E
5000|$|The Cuyahoga River splits <b>The</b> <b>Flats</b> in half {{where the}} two sides are {{referred}} to appropriately as <b>the</b> East Bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flats</b> and <b>the</b> West Bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flats.</b> While <b>the</b> East Bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flats</b> was once <b>the</b> popular nightlife district in Ohio, its demise in the early 2000s spurred a complete redevelopment where a majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing buildings were demolished. In its place, an 8-story Aloft Hotel and a 21-story office tower were built. Restaurants, apartments, and a riverside promenade are planned for Phase II of this mixed-use project. [...] <b>The</b> West Bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flats</b> contains <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district's residential population, primary stemming from a set of apartments and condos known as Stonebridge. The areas also boasts bars, restaurants, jet ski rental, strip clubs, and, most recently, <b>the</b> home <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greater Cleveland Aquarium.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> {{residents}} {{worked at}} the Heinrich Brewery {{at the south end}} or the Noerenberg Brewery (1870) at <b>the</b> north end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flats.</b> Others worked in the sawmills and flour mills farther upstream. The St. Paul and Pacific Railroad bridge (1887) and the original Washington Avenue bridge (1884) went over <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> with houses directly beneath. <b>The</b> residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> were responsible for establishing churches in Northeast Minneapolis, Cedar-Riverside, and Prospect Park, and traveled to the city center and beyond for their jobs. Members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community likely attended Americanization classes at nearby centers, such as the Pillsbury House in Cedar-Riverside or the Seven Corners Library.|$|R

5|$|In 1975, the South Glamorgan County Council leased {{the island}} for the next 99 years. In March 1995, the county council agreed to obtain Flat Holm through a 50-year lease from the Crown Estate {{starting}} on 12 December 1995. Flat Holm is now designated as a Local Nature Reserve, as stipulated in that lease. It is managed by the Cardiff Council as The Flat Holm Project. The project team operates the Lewis Alexander, a boat which was purpose-built for the crossing to Flat Holm and which is able to carry up to 45 passengers and essential supplies to the island. The work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flat</b> Holm Project {{is supported by the}} registered charity the Flat Holm Society.|$|E
5|$|Macartney scored 2,207 runs {{during the}} tour {{at an average}} of 45.04. During the English season, he reached the peak of his {{performance}} as an all-rounder, taking 38 wickets. He made six centuries, including two in one match against Sussex. Apart from his 99 at Lord's, Macartney did not pass 34 in the other Tests and ended with 197 runs at 32.83. He did not bowl heavily during the series, taking six wickets at 23.66. It was not a happy tour for the Australians; without the senior players, there were frequent reports of drunken brawls and verbal abuse towards the locals. Macartney was one of only four players to accept the guaranteed tour fee of 400 pounds; the others signed up to a percentage share of the profits and the commercial failure of the tour left them with less than half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> fee.|$|E
5|$|The island made {{communication}} history {{again on}} 8 October 2002, by {{becoming one of}} the first areas of South Wales to link to the Internet through a wireless connection deployed by Cardiff Council as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flat</b> Holm Project. The connection is used for Internet, access to Cardiff Council's data network and VOIP telephony. There are two handsets in the main farmhouse {{that are part of the}} councils own PBX thus having Cardiff dialling codes. 105 years after Marconi, Spencer Pearson an IT Consultant with Cardiff Council made the first telephone call from the island to his office at County Hall, Atlantic Wharf, Cardiff.|$|E

5|$|The {{name of the}} bastion {{refers to}} {{the faces of the}} {{fortification}} and not to the slope of the ground on which it was built; Flat Bastion was constructed on sloping ground. A 1908 map <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Flat</b> Bastion confirms that its south faces join at an obtuse angle which is relatively flat, and nearly parallel to the Charles V Wall. Flat Bastion includes Flat Bastion Magazine within its eastern portion, now a geological research and exhibition facility. The bastion is a listed building with the Gibraltar Heritage Trust. While St. Jago's Bastion has been said to be an early name for Flat Bastion, it has a separate listing with the Gibraltar Heritage Trust, next to those for Flat Bastion and Flat Bastion Magazine.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{creature}} {{may be a}} dog or a cat. Blood {{pours out}} of its mouth onto the head and body of its prey, a chimera rendered as owl-like with human facial characteristics. The prey unsuccessfully struggles to flee from its captor. The lower figure's human aspect is most notable {{in the details of}} its mouth and genitalia. Both figures are positioned in the centre foreground of the canvas, and are each mutilated and covered in blood, their physical discomfort contrasted against the flat, neutral background typical of Bacon's paintings. The figures exhibit many elements found in his early work, noticeably the expressive broad strokes set against the tightness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat,</b> nondescript background. The link with the biblical Crucifixion is made through the raised arms of the lower creature, and the T-shaped cross.|$|E
5|$|Zoe {{is found}} not guilty of Sarah's murder, due to the court believing Sarah {{committed}} suicide. After Lydia catches Mike kissing Zoe, she goes to Amy and tells her what she saw, and tells her she believes Zoe {{is trying to get}} Mike on her side {{to make it look like}} she is innocent. Lydia expresses her doubts with Mike, still trying to blame Zoe for Sarah's death. However, after realising she could try to get Zoe on her side, she pleads with her to forgive her and move into the Barnes family home. An angry Zoe throws her out. Zoe then approaches Lydia and apologises. The pair slowly become friends. However, Zoe is only pretending in order to get a confession. Lydia and Zoe kiss as part of Zoe's plan to expose Lydia as Sarah's killer. Mike throws Zoe out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat.</b>|$|E

Japanese beetle grubs uniformly dispersed to all sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> not infested with H. bacteriophora ‘Oswego' strain. In flats infested with H. bacteriophora ‘Oswego' strain, however, greater proportions of Japanese beetle grubs were recovered in sections near the nematode release site or center sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flats.</b> H. bacteriophora ‘Oswego' strain dispersed to all sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> but dispersed more rapidly within <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> infested with Japanese beetle grubs than in flats not infested with Japanese beetle grub...|$|R

5|$|During the preceramic era, {{the people}} of the {{highlands}} produced petrographs and petroglyphs representing their deities, the abundant flora and fauna of the area, abstract motives and anthropomorphic or anthropo-zoomorphic elements. The self-sufficient sedentary agricultural society developed into a culture based on ceramics and the extraction of salt in the Herrera Period, usually defined as 800 BC to 800 AD. During this time, the oldest existing form of constructed art was erected; the archaeoastronomical site called El Infiernito ("The Little Hell") by the catholic Spanish conquistadors. The Herrera Period also marked the widespread use of pottery and textiles and the start of what would become the main motive for the Spanish conquest; the skilled fine goldworking. The golden age of Muisca metallurgy is represented in the Muisca raft, considered the masterpiece of this technology and depicts the initiation ritual of the new zipa of Bacatá, {{the southern part of the}} Muisca Confederation. This ceremony, performed by xeques (priests) and caciques wearing feathered golden crowns and accompanied by music and dance, took place on a raft in Lake Guatavita, in the northern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> Bogotá savanna. Accounts of such ceremonies created the legend of El Dorado among the Spanish, leading them on a decade-long quest for this mythical place.|$|E
5|$|The canal passes {{along the}} {{south-western}} edge of Christleton, {{and through the}} centre of Waverton, {{where there is a}} large grade II listed mill building, which was once steam powered and includes bays in the right gable from which boats were loaded. The parish church is some distance from the main centre of population, on the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> Cheshire plain. The tall tower dates from the 16th century, and the roof of the nave is of hammer-beam construction, dating from 1635. There are several accommodation bridges on this section, all dating {{from the time of the}} construction of the canal, including Davies Bridge, Salmon's Bridge, and Faulkners Bridge, all built in orange brick and grade II listed structures. The railway line to Crewe follows the same general alignment as the canal, but a little further to the south, as both follow the valley of the River Gowy. The canal crosses from the south bank of the river to the north bank on an aqueduct and continues eastwards, passing the massive ruined remains of Beeston Castle, which was built in the 1220s by the Earl of Chester on top of a steep hill, and dominates the countryside.|$|E
