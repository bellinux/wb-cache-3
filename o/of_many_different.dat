5|$|In Quenya, {{there are}} many {{similarities}} in form between prepositions and adverbs since the grammatical case already determines the relation of verb and object. Many Quenya prepositions have adverb-like uses with no complement. In Common Eldarin, these prepositions were postpositions instead, and later became inflectional endings. Case markings combine primarily with nouns, whereas prepositions can combine with phrases <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> categories. This is why most prepositions in Quenya are used with a noun in the nominative case.|$|E
5|$|Mayon Volcano, the Philippines {{most active}} volcano. It {{has been the}} site <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> types of eruptions, Peléan included. Approximately 40 ravines radiate from the summit and provide {{pathways}} for frequent pyroclastic flows and mudslides to the lowlands below. Mayon's most violent eruption occurred in 1814 and was responsible for over 1200 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1079 and 1532, Winchester Cathedral has had {{an unusual}} {{architectural}} history. The exterior, apart from the modified windows, gives {{the impression of a}} massive Norman building and indeed, it is the longest medieval church in the world. However, the west front is now Perpendicular, with its huge window filled with fragments of medieval glass. Inside, only the crypt and the transepts have retained their Norman appearance. The spectacular Perpendicular nave with its tall arcade arches and strong vertical emphasis has been literally carved out of the original Norman interior. The Very Rev. Sykes wrote of it “Well might the visitor who enters … by the west door gasp with amazement.” Winchester is also famous for its carved wooden fittings <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> periods.|$|E

5|$|Canada is a {{multilingual}} {{and multicultural}} society home to people <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> ethnic, religious and national origins, {{with the majority}} of the population made up of Old World immigrants and their descendants. Following the initial period of French and then the much larger British colonization, different waves (or peaks) of immigration and settlement of non-indigenous peoples took place over the course of nearly two centuries and continue today. Elements of Indigenous, French, British, and more recent immigrant customs, languages and religions have combined to form the culture of Canada and thus a Canadian identity. Canada has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the United States.|$|E

The sovereignty of the Knights Hospitaller over Malta from 1530 to 1798 resulted in a legacy of elaborate artistry and architecture throughout Malta. The country's modern museums and art galleries feature relics from Malta's history for tourists and Maltese residents alike to enjoy.|$|E

Mir's purpose {{was to provide a}} large and habitable scientific laboratory in space, and, through a number of collaborations, including Intercosmos and Shuttle-Mir, was made internationally accessible to cosmonauts and astronauts <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> countries. The station existed until March 23, 2001, at which point it was deliberately deorbited, and broke apart during atmospheric re-entry.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand is a multiethnic society, {{and home}} to people <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> {{national}} origins. Originally composed solely of the Māori who arrived in the thirteenth century, the ethnic makeup of the population later became dominated by New Zealanders of European descent. In the nineteenth century, European settlers brought diseases for which the Māori had no immunity. By the 1890s, the Māori population was approximately 40 percent of its size pre-contact. The Māori population increased during the twentieth century, though it remains a minority.|$|E
5|$|Research at Simla {{formally}} {{began in}} 1950. Beebe's research at Simla combined elements <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> earlier stages of his research, including {{observations of the}} life cycles of the area's birds, detailed analyses of every plant and animal in small areas of forest, and studies of insect behavior. Insects were {{the focus of the}} scientific papers he produced during this period, marking a transition from his past areas of study into the field of entomology. Local children periodically brought animal specimens to Beebe at Simla and asked him to classify them. Remembering the early studies of his own childhood, in which he had brought specimens to the American Museum of Natural History, he was happy working with them.|$|E

5|$|Virtually all {{microbes}} {{can trigger}} an antibody response. Successful recognition and eradication <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> types of microbes requires diversity among antibodies; their amino acid composition varies {{allowing them to}} interact with many different antigens. It {{has been estimated that}} humans generate about 10billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen. Although a huge repertoire of different antibodies is generated in a single individual, the number of genes available to make these proteins is limited {{by the size of the}} human genome. Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that allow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes.|$|E

Walter explains he believes the creature is a man-made chimera, which has the best genetic traits <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> creatures, including a lizard, bat, and wasp. He had tried to create the creature years before, but his experiments failed, and concludes that someone else must have taken up his research. Though initially thinking Charlie was healthy after the attack, they realize the chimera's stinger injected him with its larvae, {{and that he has}} less than 24 hours to live.|$|E

5|$|In this section, Heilmann draws {{evidence}} from his observations of germ cells, impregnation, cell division, ontogeny and comparative embryology about the probable ancestry of birds. A {{fair amount of}} detail is devoted early in the section to comparative studies between the germ cells <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> species of extant bird and reptile (and several mammals), including some comments on the corkscrew locomotion observed in the spermatozoa cells of several bird and reptile species, but no mammals. He {{then goes on to}} offer a similar comparison between the egg cells of birds and reptiles, and finds considerably more similarity there than either has to the egg cell of a mammal. Following an analysis of the germ cells, he moves onward through the developmental cycle by next examining the process of fertilization and subsequent cleavage of the zygote. He presents here several figures and illustrations of the cleavage of the blastoderm in reptiles and birds.|$|E
5|$|Major interplanetary {{corporations}} {{known as}} Hammond Robotics—a major manufacturing, aerospace and defense contractor—used {{resources of the}} Frontier to make builds of mecha-combatants such as Titans and Spectres. Titans are descendants of present-day fledgling military exoskeletons. In addition to the obvious combat applications, unarmed forms of Titans are used in heavy industries like cargo transport and deep space ship salvage. They are also used in special applications such as deep space search and rescue, and are very effective in inhospitable environments. The use of Titans is widespread throughout the Frontier in both combat and civilian life. As with Titans, the Frontier contains Pilots <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> styles and experiences. Titan Pilots are rated by 'certifications', most of which apply to civilian applications, such as construction, shipping, and heavy salvage industries. The most prestigious {{of these is the}} Full Combat Certification - a widely published series of tests that grade a Titan Pilot's abilities. Because of the extreme physical and mental challenges of mastering both Titan combat & dismounted parkour movement, a fully combat certified Titan pilot is a rare find, and the combat skills of active Pilots in the field varies widely throughout the Frontier.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} of boron is nonmetallic in nature. Unlike its heavier congeners, {{it is not known}} to form a simple B3+ or hydrated 3+ cation. The small size of the boron atom enables the preparation of many interstitial alloy-type borides. Analogies between boron and transition metals have been noted in the formation of complexes, and adducts (for example, BH3 + CO →BH3CO and, similarly, Fe(CO)4 + CO →Fe(CO)5), {{as well as in the}} geometric and electronic structures of cluster species such as 2− and 2−. The aqueous chemistry of boron is characterised by the formation <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> polyborate anions. Given its high charge-to-size ratio, boron bonds covalently in nearly all of its compounds; the exceptions are the borides as these include, depending on their composition, covalent, ionic and metallic bonding components. Simple binary compounds, such as boron trichloride are Lewis acids as the formation of three covalent bonds leaves a hole in the octet which can be filled by an electron-pair donated by a Lewis base. Boron has a strong affinity for oxygen and a duly extensive borate chemistry. The oxide B2O3 is polymeric in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Organometallic compounds of boron have been known since the 19th century (see organoboron chemistry).|$|E
