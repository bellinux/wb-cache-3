5000|$|A Commission Sharing Agreement ("CSA") {{or in the}} US named Client Commission Agreement ("CCA") {{is a type of}} soft dollar {{arrangement}} that allows money managers to separately pay the executing broker for trade execution and ask that broker to allocate a portion of the commission directly to an independent research provider. CSAs consist of a percentage of execution fees, that are directed to pay for research reports from sell-side banks. The form of a CSA can be as short as one page. One of the disadvantages of CSAs is the counterparty risk, that the broker becomes as the cash is held on the broker's balance sheet [...] and not in a <b>segregated</b> <b>client</b> <b>account.</b> Moves included in MiFID II such as the creation of Research Payment Accounts (RPAs) aim to address this issue.|$|R

50|$|Lehman Brothers International (Europe) was the UK {{subsidiary}} of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, the US parent {{that had gone}} in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. It had held money on behalf of many clients, including some affiliates of Lehman. The client money rules of Financial Services Authority were in the Client Assets Sourcebook, chapter 7, issued under the FSMA 2000 section 138. FSMA 2000 section 139 permitted FSA rulemaking for ‘clients’ money being held on trust {{in accordance with the}} rules’, and accordingly CASS 7.7.2R said that client money was to be held on trust for the purpose of the client money rules. If a firm failed, the client money distribution rules in CASS 7.9 applied. But under CASS 7.4, a firm could either (1) pay money into a segregated account or (2) put the money into the firm’s own house accounts and then <b>segregate</b> it into <b>client</b> <b>accounts</b> {{at the close of the}} preceding day’s business. Lehman had done the alternative approach in (2). On 15 September 2008, Lehman went into administration, a ‘primary pooling event’ under CASS 7, so the funds in each ‘client money account’ were to be treated as pooled and then distributed so that each client received a sum rateable to their ‘client money entitlement’. The administrators asked the High Court for directions under the Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, about how to apply CASS 7 to the client money that Lehman held. There was a lot of unsegregated client money in the firm’s house accounts because of the operation of the alternative approach, and also significant non-compliance of Lehman with CASS 7 over a long time.|$|R
