25|$|There {{are some}} ESI methods that require {{little to no}} sample preparation. One such method is a method termed {{extractive}} electrospray ionization (EESI). This method involves having an electrospray <b>of</b> <b>solvent</b> directed at an angle against a different spray of the sample solution, produced by a separate nebulizer. This method requires no sample preparation in that the electrospray <b>of</b> <b>solvent</b> extracts the sample from the complex mixture, effectively removing any background contaminants. Another particularly powerful variation on ESI is desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which involves directing an electrospray at a surface with the sample deposited on top of it. The sample is ionized in the electrospray as it splashes off the surface, then traveling to the mass spectrometer. This method is important {{because of the fact}} that no sample preparation is needed for this method. A sample simply needs to be deposited on a surface, such as paper. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) is similar to ESI in that the sample is nebulized in droplets that are then evaporated, leaving behind a charged ion to be analyzed. APCI experiences few of the negative matrix effects experienced by ESI due to the fact that ionization occurs in the gas phase in this method rather than the within the liquid droplets as in ESI and the fact that in APCI there is an overabundance of reaction gas, thus minimizing the effect of the matrix on the ionization process.|$|E
25|$|In {{each case}} an {{equilibrium}} constant {{can be specified}} as a quotient of activities. This equilibrium constant is dimensionless as activity is a dimensionless quantity. However, use of activities is very inconvenient, so the equilibrium constant is usually divided by the quotient of activity coefficients, to become a quotient of concentrations. See equilibrium chemistry#Equilibrium constant for details. Moreover, the concentration <b>of</b> <b>solvent</b> is usually taken to be constant and so is also subsumed into the equilibrium constant. For these reasons, the constant for a solubility equilibrium has dimensions related to the scale on which concentrations are measured. Solubility constants {{defined in terms of}} concentrations are not only temperature dependent, but also may depend on solvent composition when the solvent contains also species other than those derived from the solute.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report a}} {{strategy}} that combines supra-molecular assembly and solvent annealing to manipulate the microdomain orientation in block copolymer thin films. In supramolecular thin films formed by polystyrene-b-poly(4 -vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P 4 VP) with 3 -pentadecylphenol (PDP) hydrogen-bonded onto P 4 VP blocks, where PS blocks phase-separate into cylindrical microdomains, {{we found that the}} orientation of PS cylinders can be controlled by using different types <b>of</b> <b>solvents</b> to anneal the films. As films are annealed under the vapors <b>of</b> <b>solvents</b> bearing no oxygen atoms, such as chloroform, PS cylinders are perpendicular to the surface, while under those <b>of</b> <b>solvents</b> bearing oxygen, such as THF, PS cylinders are parallel to the surface. Furthermore, the orientation is switchable upon the alternate use of different types <b>of</b> <b>solvents.</b> The 1 H NMR measurements showed that the strengths of hydrogen bonds between PDP and P 4 VP are greatly weakened in oxygen-bearing solvents due to the competition of the highly electronegative oxygen atoms. We thus suggest that the binding capability of PDP onto P 4 VP is the key to determine whether the supramolecules can be assembled in the vapors of different types <b>of</b> <b>solvents,</b> which in turn, regulates the orientation of PS cylinders...|$|R
