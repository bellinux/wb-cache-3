25|$|While the Apostolic process {{concerning}} {{the reputation of}} sanctity was under way outside of Rome, documents were prepared by the Procurator of the cause for the discussion de non cultu, or absence of cultus, and at the appointed time an <b>ordinary</b> <b>meeting</b> (congregatio) was held in which the matter was investigated; if {{it was found that}} the decree of Pope Urban VIII had been obeyed, another decree provided that further steps might be taken.|$|E
25|$|When {{the inquiry}} {{concerning}} {{the reputation of}} sanctity (super fama) had arrived in Rome, it was opened (as already described in speaking of the ordinary processes, and with the same formalities in regard to rescripts), then translated into Italian, summarized, and declared valid. The documents super fama in general were prepared by the Advocate, and at the proper time, in an <b>ordinary</b> <b>meeting</b> of the cardinals of the Congregation of Rites, the question was discussed: whether there was evidence of a general repute for sanctity and miracles of this servant of God. If the answer was favourable, a decree embodying this result was published.|$|E

25|$|Tec has a {{good record}} in college athletics, picking up over 18% of the medals at the 2007 {{national}} collegiate competition (Universiada) {{and one of its}} campuses won every American Football Collegiate Championship in Mexico (ONEFA) from 1998 to 2008. Such accomplishments were possible through the Institute's investments in sports facilities and personnel and a well-funded and comprehensive athletic scholarships program, which attracted a significant number of promising athletes but prompted allegations of talent drain by some of its rivals. Before the 2009 season the Institute decided to part ways with the organization and create a new league; however, the league didn't materialize after other breakaway universities decided to remain in the ONEFA. The Institute asked to return to the organization, but the ONEFA Board decided that the request should be formally presented in its next <b>ordinary</b> <b>meeting,</b> after the 2009 season, which its four teams ended up playing between themselves in a Tech-only championship. For the 2010 season, the Institute decided not to participate in the ONEFA championship and, instead, asked the CONADEIP, a national athletic association of private educational institutions, to create an American football championship.|$|E

2500|$|This {{procedure}} was followed {{in all cases}} of formal beatification in causes of both confessors and martyrs proposed in the ordinary way ("per viam non cultus"). Those proposed as coming under the definition of cases excepted ("casus excepti") by Pope Urban VIII were treated differently. In such cases proof is required that an immemorial public veneration for at least 100 years before the promulgation in 1640 of the decrees of Pope Urban VIII had been paid the servant of God, whether as a confessor or martyr. Such cause was proposed under the title of [...] "confirmation of veneration" [...] ("de confirmatione cultus"); it was considered in an <b>ordinary</b> <b>meeting</b> of the Congregation of Rites.

The magistrate passed by the end where Benjamin was seated, and posted himself, at a safe distance from the steward, in front of the Leather- Stocking.

One rapid glance into his pale features, which suffering and intellectual labor seemed in some measure to have etherealized, was sufficient. She had all the poignant sense of a culprit before an injured but merciful judge, and at that moment the memory of those dying words was faint within her. And so, though it is not usually the case, it was he who appeared the least disturbed, and he it was who broke that strange silence which had lasted several moments after she had come to a standstill before him.|$|E
