5|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{combines}} NASA's Space Station Freedom {{project with}} the Soviet/Russian Mir-2 station, the European Columbus station, and the Japanese Kibō laboratory module. NASA originally planned in the 1980s to develop Freedom alone, but US budget constraints {{led to the}} merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The station consists of pressurized modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components, which have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and the US Space Shuttles. It is currently being assembled in Low Earth Orbit. The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, {{the completion of the}} US <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment</b> occurred in 2011 and the completion of the Russian <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment</b> is expected by 2016. The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements which divide the station into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment</b> (with the exception of Zarya), with the US <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment</b> allocated between the other international partners.|$|E
25|$|The ISS {{programme}} is a {{joint project}} among five participating space agencies: NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, ESA, and CSA. The ownership {{and use of the}} space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements. The station is divided into two sections, the Russian <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment</b> (ROS) and the United States <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment</b> (USOS), which is shared by many nations. , the American portion of ISS is being funded until 2024. Roscosmos has endorsed the continued operation of ISS through 2024 but has proposed using elements of the Russian <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment</b> to construct a new Russian space station called OPSEK.|$|E

50|$|USOS modules {{were brought}} to the station by the Space Shuttle and {{manually}} attached to the ISS by crews during EVAs. Connections are made manually for electrical, data, propulsion and cooling fluids. This results in a single piece which is not designed for disassembly.The Russian <b>orbital</b> <b>segment's</b> modules are able to launch, fly and dock themselves without human intervention using Proton rockets. Connections are automatically made for power, data and propulsion fluids and gases. The Russian approach allows assembly of space stations orbiting other worlds in preparation for manned missions.

They {{also had an}} {{elongated}} maxilla, a long cheek region and a long post <b>orbital</b> <b>segment.</b> The carotid foramina in the basisphenoid in the skull is paired and is separated by the parasphenoid. Also, the parasphenoid has a processus cultriformis. The largest T. platyodon skulls can range from 1m to 1.5m long.|$|E
25|$|The Russian <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment</b> {{contains}} the Data Management System, which handles Guidance, Navigation and Control (ROS GNC) {{for the entire}} station. Initially, Zarya, the first module of the station, controlled the station until a short time after the Russian service module Zvezda docked and was transferred control. Zvezda {{contains the}} ESA built DMS-R Data Management System. Using two fault-tolerant computers (FTC), Zvezda computes the station's position and orbital trajectory using redundant Earth horizon sensors, Solar horizon sensors as well as Sun and star trackers. The FTCs each contain three identical processing units working in parallel and provide advanced fault-masking by majority voting.|$|E
25|$|Nauka {{mission has}} changed over time. During the mid-1990s, it was {{intended}} as a backup for the FGB, and later as a universal docking module (UDM); its docking ports will be able to support automatic docking of both spacecraft, additional modules and fuel transfer. Nauka has its own engines. Like Zvezda and Zarya, Nauka will be launched by a Proton rocket, while smaller Russian modules such as Pirs and Poisk were delivered by modified Progress spacecraft. Russia plans to separate Nauka, {{along with the rest of}} the Russian <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment,</b> to form the OPSEK space station before the ISS is deorbited.|$|E
30|$|The latter {{asymmetry}} {{can appear}} {{due to the}} Parker orientation of the IMF in the solar wind. For the nominal IMF orientation (+Y −X or −Y +X) the induced magnetosphere is stronger protected from the magnetosheath plasma at the dusk side where the draped magnetic field is almost tangential to the magnetospheric boundary while at the dawnside, where the magnetic field is more radial, solar wind more easy {{gain access to the}} magnetosphere (Dubinin et al., 2008 c). Figure 5 (b) shows the <b>orbital</b> <b>segments</b> on which the ionosphere was expanded (red curves) or contracted (blue curves) in the YZmso plane for the 12 selected cases. It is worth noting that the MEX orbit is not suitable to study a dawn-dusk asymmetry because the spacecraft surveyed mainly the low-altitude dusk ionosphere. It is well seen in Fig. 10 (a) which shows the map of the fluxes of the low-energy oxygen ions in the XYmso plane. The absense of ion fluxes at the dawn side {{is due to the fact}} that MEX sampled this region at much higher altitudes.|$|R
40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is {{developing}} a Fine Water Mist (FWM) Portable Fire Extinguisher (PFE) for use on the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS presently uses {{two different types of}} fire extinguishers: a water foam extinguisher in the Russian Segment, and a carbon dioxide extinguisher in the United States <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segments,</b> which include Columbus and Kibo pressurized elements. Currently, there are operational concerns with the emergency breathing equipment and the carbon dioxide extinguisher. The toxicity of the carbon dioxide requires the crew members to have an oxygen supply present during a fire event, therefore inherently creating an unsafe environment. The FWM PFE extinguishes a fire without creating a hazardous breathing environment for crew members. The following paper will discuss the unique functional and performance requirements that have been levied on the FWM PFE, identify unique microgravity design considerations for liquid and gas systems, as well as discuss the NASA ISS specific fire standards that were developed to establish an acceptable portable fire extinguisher s performance...|$|R

25|$|The Russian <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment</b> {{communicates}} {{directly with}} the ground via the Lira antenna mounted to Zvezda. The Lira antenna also has the capability to use the Luch data relay satellite system. This system, used for communications with Mir, fell into disrepair during the 1990s, and so {{is no longer in}} use, although two new Luch satellites—Luch-5A and Luch-5B—were launched in 2011 and 2012 respectively to restore the operational capability of the system. Another Russian communications system is the Voskhod-M, which enables internal telephone communications between Zvezda, Zarya, Pirs, Poisk and the USOS, and also provides a VHF radio link to ground control centres via antennas on Zvezda exterior.|$|E
25|$|The US <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment</b> (USOS) {{makes use}} of two {{separate}} radio links mounted in the Z1 truss structure: the S band (used for audio) and Ku band (used for audio, video and data) systems. These transmissions are routed via the United States Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) in geostationary orbit, which allows for almost continuous real-time communications with NASA's Mission Control Center (MCC-H) in Houston. Data channels for the Canadarm2, European Columbus laboratory and Japanese Kibō modules are routed via the S band and Ku band systems, although the European Data Relay System and a similar Japanese system will eventually complement the TDRSS in this role. Communications between modules are carried on an internal digital wireless network.|$|E
25|$|Several modules {{planned for}} the station were {{cancelled}} {{over the course of}} the ISS programme. Reasons include budgetary constraints, the modules becoming unnecessary, and station redesigns after the 2003 Columbia disaster. The US Centrifuge Accommodations Module would have hosted science experiments in varying levels of artificial gravity. The US Habitation Module would have served as the station's living quarters. Instead, the sleep stations are now spread throughout the station. The US Interim Control Module and ISS Propulsion Module would have replaced the functions of Zvezda in case of a launch failure. Two Russian Research Modules were planned for scientific research. They would have docked to a Russian Universal Docking Module. The Russian Science Power Platform would have supplied power to the Russian <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment</b> independent of the ITS solar arrays.|$|E
40|$|Objectives The {{trochlear nerve}} is {{important}} to preserve during approaches to the skull base. Traditionally, this nerve has been divided into cisternal, cavernous, and <b>orbital</b> <b>segments.</b> However, the authors anecdotally observed an additional segment during routine cadaveric dissections. Therefore, they performed this study to better elucidate this anatomy. Design Twenty latex-injected cadaveric sides (10 adult cadavers) were dissected {{with the aid of}} an operating microscope. Standard microdissection techniques were used to examine the course of the distal cisternal and precavernous segments of the trochlear nerve. Setting Cadaver laboratory. Main Outcome Measures Measurements were made using a microcaliper. Digital images were made of the dissections. Results The authors identified a previously undescribed segment of the trochlear nerve in all specimens. This part of the nerve coursed between the entrance of the trochlear nerve into the posterior corner of the oculomotor trigone to the posterior wall of the cavernous sinus. This segment of trochlear nerve was, on average, 4 [*]mm in length. Conclusions The authors have identified a new segment of the trochlear nerve not previously described. They propose that this be referred to as the trigonal segment. Knowledge of the microanatomy of the trochlear nerve is useful to skull base surgeons...|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} {{surgical technique}} {{for the treatment}} of exophthalmos caused by Graves' disease or meningioma is presented. It is based on the orbital expansion as presented by Tessier (1969). It consisted of a lateral marginotomy with extension to the superior and inferior orbital rim and removal of the great wing of the sphenoid bone. The osteotomised <b>orbital</b> rim <b>segment</b> was advanced and stabilised by interposition of a calvarial bone graft. Concomitant lipectomy was carried out when indicated. Seven patients were operated on. No major complications occurred. The advantages of the method are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Asymmetry of plasma flow {{can also}} appear due to crustal {{magnetic}} field. Crider et al. (2002) {{have found that}} the magnetospheric boundary moves upward with increasing southern latitude. Fraenz et al. (2006) and Dubinin et al. (2008 a) have shown that the boundary above strong crustal sources can shift upward by ~ 400 km as compared to the boundary in the northern hemisphere. Due to the local origin of crustal magnetic fields on Mars, the surface of the magnetospheric cavity occurs corrugated (Brain et al., 2006; Dubinin et al., 2008 c) and the ionospheric plasma lifting up along the crustal field lines produces swells in the density distribution. Figure 5 (c) shows the trajectories of MEX orbits at which MARSIS examined the upper ionosphere at almost the same solar zenith angles on the inbound and outbound crossings. Blue and red curves correspond to the orbital legs at which the ionosphere was contracted or expanded, respectively. Trajectories are given in the variables: altitude-model radial component of the crustal magnetic field at 400 km. It is seen that although for these selected cases we try to minimize a possible role of crustal sources, the ionospheric expansion usually occurs on the <b>orbital</b> <b>segments</b> with higher values of the crustal field, even if the value of the local field is small to balance the solar wind dynamic pressure.|$|R
25|$|According to a 2009 report, Space Corporation Energia is {{considering}} methods to {{remove from the}} station some modules of the Russian <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment</b> when the end of mission is reached and use them {{as a basis for}} a new station, called the Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex (OPSEK). The modules under consideration for removal from the current ISS include the Multipurpose Laboratory Module (Nauka), currently scheduled to be launched in 2017, and other Russian modules which are planned to be attached to Nauka afterwards. Those modules would be within their useful lives in 2016 or 2020. The report presents a statement from an unnamed Russian engineer that, based on the experience from Mir, a 30-year life should be possible, except for micrometeorite damage, because the Russian modules have been built with on-orbit refurbishment in mind.|$|E
25|$|The docking module {{originated}} in the 1992 design version of the cancelled Mir-2 space station, which featured a combined docking compartment and airlock to facilitate docking missions during the Soviet Buran space shuttle programme (this module, SO-1, was eventually incorporated into the Russian <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment</b> of the International Space Station as Pirs). When the Shuttle-Mir programme began, engineers realised {{that in order to}} enable US space shuttles to dock to Mir, the Kristall module would have to be relocated to the forward port of the core module and back to its own lateral port each time a shuttle docked, a process which was not only time consuming but would also be entirely reliant on Kristalls Lyappa arm, which, should it fail, would prevent any further shuttle missions to the station. Adding a small extension to Kristall, however, would provide the shuttles the clearance they needed to dock without necessitating the relocation of the module on each occasion, and it was decided to base the design of the new module loosely on that of the Mir-2 docking compartment.|$|E
25|$|Space debris is tracked {{remotely}} {{from the}} ground, and the station crew can be notified. This {{allows for a}} Debris Avoidance Manoeuvre (DAM) to be conducted, which uses thrusters on the Russian <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment</b> to alter the station's orbital altitude, avoiding the debris. DAMs are not uncommon, taking place if computational models show the debris will approach within a certain threat distance. Eight DAMs had been performed prior to March 2009, the first seven between October 1999 and May 2003. Usually, the orbit is raised by one or two kilometres {{by means of an}} increase in orbital velocity of the order of 1m/s. Unusually, there was a lowering of 1.7km on 27 August 2008, the first such lowering for 8 years. There were two DAMs in 2009, on 22 March and 17 July. If a threat from orbital debris is identified too late for a DAM to be safely conducted, the station crew close all the hatches aboard the station and retreat into their Soyuz spacecraft, so that {{they would be able to}} evacuate in the event the station was seriously damaged by the debris. This partial station evacuation has occurred on 13 March 2009, 28 June 2011, 24 March 2012 and 16 June 2015.|$|E
40|$|The Australian Geographic Reference Image (AGRI) is a {{national}} satellite image mosaic that covers the vast Australian continent. Formed from 9560 ALOS PRISM images, AGRI provides a spatially correct reference image at 2. 5 m resolution, with 1 -pixel accuracy. The production of AGRI was made feasible by {{the development and implementation}} of a long-strip adjustment technique that facilitated a refinement in the georeferencing process of orbit and attitude parameters for <b>orbital</b> <b>segments</b> comprising 50 or more images. The strip of images is effectively treated as a single image. The ground control requirements for such full-pass georeferencing, which does not require the measurement of tie or pass points, amount to only 4 – 8 GCPs for the complete strip rather than 4 or more per image within the strip. Once the adjusted orbit parameters are obtained, the georeferencing and orthorectification process can revert to a fully automatic image-by-image computation. This paper first overviews AGRI and then describes the longstrip adjustment technique that made its production possible. Testing and validation are then discussed via the example of the georeferencing of a 1527 km single strip of 55 PRISM images. The testing phase verified that 1 -pixel accuracy georeferencing could be achieved with the long-strip adjustment approach, and in the production of AGRI accuracy checks against 2460 checkpoints yielded an RMS discrepancy of close to 2. 5 m and a 90...|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{comparison}} of dynamical models with observations of the interstellar gas in 6 Virgo cluster spiral galaxies a first complete ram pressure stripping time sequence has been established. The observational characteristics of the different stages of ram pressure stripping are presented. The dynamical models yield the 3 D velocity vectors of the galaxies, peak ram pressures, and times to peak ram pressure. In {{the case of a}} smooth, static, and spherical intracluster medium, peak ram pressure occurs during the galaxy's closest approach to the cluster center, i. e. when the galaxy's velocity vector is perpendicular to its distance vector from the cluster center (M 87). Assuming this condition the galaxy's present line-of-sight distance and its 3 D position during peak ram pressure can be calculated. The linear <b>orbital</b> <b>segments</b> derived in this way together with the intracluster medium density distribution derived from X-ray observations give estimates of the ram pressure that are on average a factor of 2 higher than derived from the dynamical simulations for NGC 4501, NGC 4330, and NGC 4569. Resolving this discrepancy would require either a 2 times higher intracluster medium density than derived from X-ray observations, or a 2 times higher stripping efficiency than assumed by the dynamical models. Compared to NGC 4501, NGC 4330, and NGC 4569, NGC 4388 requires a still 2 times higher local intracluster medium density or a direction which is moderately different from that derived from the dynamical model. A possible scenario for the dynamical evolution of NGC 4438 and M 86 within the Virgo cluster is presented. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures; accepted for publication in A&...|$|R
40|$|The segment-molecular-orbital {{representation}} is developed and {{incorporated into the}} recently developed linear-scaling localized-density-matrix method. The entire system is divided into many segments, and the molecular <b>orbitals</b> of all <b>segments</b> form the basis functions of the segment-molecular-orbital representation. Introduction of different cutoff lengths for different segment-molecular-orbitals leads to a drastic reduction of the computational cost. As a result, the modified localized-density-matrix method is employed to investigate the optical responses of large Poly(p-phenylenevinylene) aggregates. In particular, the interchain excitations are studied.

It was handed off to Canadarm2, which was operated by Greg Chamitoff and Greg Johnson, and {{was installed in}} its final location on the S3 truss segment at 09:46 UTC. Immediately after the installation, crews on the ground began activating the experiment. The installation of the AMS-2 marked {{the completion of the}} US <b>Orbital</b> <b>Segment</b> of the International Space Station. Later in the day, Greg Chamitoff, Drew Feustel and Mike Fincke prepared the Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) that Chamitoff and Feustel would wear during their spacewalk on flight day 5. The trio was also assisted by commander Mark Kelly in preparing the tools required for the Extravehicular Activity (EVA). While this was going on, Expedition 27 crew members Paolo Nespoli, Cady Coleman and Ron Garan assisted the rest of the STS-134 crew in completing transfers to and from Endeavour. Late in the crew day, the two crews performed an EVA procedures review. After the review, Chamitoff and Feustel camped out in the Quest Airlock overnight, in preparation for the mission's first spacewalk. The campout was done with the airlock's air pressure reduced, so as to purge nitrogen bubbles from the astronauts' blood and thus prevent decompression sickness. Members of both crews also conducted two in-flight interviews with media on the ground, including PBS NewsHour, National Public Radio, Associated Press, Reuters and Fox News. The crew also answered questions that were relayed up to them by Miles O'Brien for Google.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{detection}} of weak continuous signals from sources in binary systems via the incoherent combination of many "short" coherently-analyzed segments. The main focus {{of the work is}} on the construction of a metric on the parameter space for such signals for use in matched-filter based searches. The metric is defined using a maximum likelihood detection statistic applied to a binary orbit phase model including eccentricity. We find that this metric can be accurately approximated by its diagonal form in the regime where the segment length is > the segment length) for all but the orbital angular frequency. Increased template density for this parameter scales linearly with the observation span. We also present two example search schemes. The first uses a re parameterized phase model upon which we compute the metric on individual short coherently analyzed segments. The second assumes long >> the <b>orbital</b> period <b>segment</b> lengths from which we again compute the coherent metric and find it to be approximately diagonal.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{long-term}} stability of X-ray modulation apparently synchronized with an orbital period of 3. 9 {{days in the}} gamma-ray binary LS 5039. Recent observations with the Suzaku satellite in the year 2007, which covered continuously more than one orbital period, have provided us with detailed characterization of X-ray flux and spectral shape {{as a function of}} orbital phase. Motivated by the results from Suzaku, we have re-analyzed the X-ray data obtained with ASCA, XMM-Newton, and Chandra between 1999 and 2005, to investigate long-term behavior of LS 5039 in the X-ray band. We found that the modulation curves in 1999 [...] 2007 are surprisingly stable. Even fine structures in the light curves such as spikes and dips are found to be quite similar from one orbit to another. The spectral characteristics observed in the past are consistent with those seen with Suzaku for some <b>orbital</b> phase <b>segments.</b> We suggest that magneto-hydrodynamical collisions between the relativistic outflow from a compact object and the stellar wind from the O star explain the clock-like non-thermal X-ray emission over eight years through remarkably stable production of high-energy particles near the binary system.

40|$|The Orbview- 1 {{spacecraft}} {{was launched}} in April, 1995. It is a small, low-orbiting satellite with two scientific payloads, the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) and the GPS Meteorological instrument (GPS-Met). The Orbview- 1 mission was developed in alignment with NASA 2 ̆ 7 s directive of 2 ̆ 2 cheaper, better, faster 2 ̆ 2 satellite programs. An important element in achieving these goals is the reduction in operations cost through spacecraft automation.
