The count established a power base in the region, but in 1218 William Marshal, the regent, ordered him to return it to the Crown; the count declined. Further demands followed until, in 1220, royal forces besieged and took the count's castle at nearby Rockingham.

5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their <b>own</b> <b>free</b> <b>will.</b> Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of ethics in Martin Heidegger {{is reduced to}} the {{question of}} Man’s finite existence - of his being capable of death as death. An in-depth survey of several early Heideggerian texts on death highlights the feasibility of refounding a practical philosophy circumscribed by the presupposition of death as a possibility that comprises all of the possibilities of existence of the Dasein: the There-Being. In fact, Man’s relationship to his own death determines the how of his relationship with other men and the world. His relationship with death is not something that occurs out of necessity, but something that is open to his <b>own</b> <b>free</b> <b>willed</b> decision. In late Heidegger, such resoluteness, Entschlossenheit, is radicalized in its intrinsic ontological value. Man becomes mortal, and his mortality allows him to take his place into the Four-Fold: the Geviert from which his dwelling in the world receives its sense of being. In late Heidegger, such an opening does not necessarily occur except for those who choose to take charge of their own Being able to die. This article also traces the notion of the finiteness of Man in Heideggerian thought with regard {{to the question of}} Man’s actions in the world...|$|R

60|$|The {{only answer}} is, 'Pray, because God is your Father, and you His child.' The only answer; {{but the most}} {{complete}} answer. I will engage to say, that if anyone here is ever troubled with doubts about prayer, those two simple words, 'Our Father,' if he can once really believe them in their full richness and depth, will make the doubts vanish in a moment, and prayer seem the most natural and reasonable of all acts. It is because we are God's children, not merely His creatures, that He will have us pray. Because He is educating us to know Him; to know Him not merely to be an Almighty Power, but a living, loving Person; not merely an irresistible Fate, but a Father who delights in the love of His children, who wishes to shape them into His own likeness, and make them fellow-workers with Him; therefore it is that He will have us pray. Doubtless he could have given us everything without our asking; for He does already give us almost everything without our asking. But He wishes to educate us as His children; to make us trust in Him; to make us love Him; to make us work for Him of our <b>own</b> <b>free</b> <b>wills,</b> in the great battle which He is carrying on against evil; and that He can only do by teaching us to pray to Him. I say it reverently, but firmly. As {{far as we can}} see, God cannot educate us to know Him, The living, willing, loving Father, unless He teaches us to open our hearts to Him, and to ask Him freely for what we want, just because He knows what we want already.|$|R

5000|$|Svecchācāra is {{important}} in the Nath Sampradaya evocation of their realized ideal, of the Avadhuta; as Mahendranath states:"Sveccha means one's <b>own</b> wish or <b>free</b> <b>will.</b> Svecchachara means a way of life where one acts as one wishes and does what is right in one's own eyes. Doing one's own Will. The concluding Sanskrit expression in the Avadhoota Upanishad is [...] "Svecchachara Paro." [...] The term [...] "Paro" [...] means a mysterious or secret pattern to that action done by one's own Will. In other words, we do our Will but with discretion, not making it too obvious, nor to harm or hurt other people. Yet this is also a typical Nathism; a complete reversal of Vedic morals and philosophy.|$|R
40|$|Whether <b>free</b> <b>will</b> exists or not, is a {{question}} yet to be answered in both scientific and philosophical terms.

In this project we wish to investigate Libets results from the article Do We Have <b>Free</b> <b>Will?</b> (1999) to discover how much they actually challenge <b>free</b> <b>will.</b> We will independently study Libets results and question his conclusions. The objections of philosopher Alfred Mele, {{will be added to}} our criticism towards Libets experiment. We also wish to investigate and verify the arguments used by Libet in previously mentioned article. To this analysis of arguments, we will use Alec Fishers recipe for inspecting the claims Libet take about his findings. Our investigations show a basic problem with Libets arguments. This problem is his interpretation of data. Furthermore our results show that there is two ways to interpret Libets results. The first simply takes its standing point from Libets <b>own</b> interpretation of <b>free</b> <b>will</b> and its criteria’s. Libet assumes that, if <b>free</b> <b>will</b> were to be challenged, the conscious will has to initiate the electrical impulses in the brain, before these impulses determine the act. He concludes that this assumption was correct, since his experiment shows that conscious will occurs after the electrical impulses. The second possibility is a softer interpretation. This interpretation states that this assumption is not necessarily correct. In the attempt of allowing Libets results to actually challenge <b>free</b> <b>will,</b> we decide to make a model which has the ability to point out the deterministic factor. In this more charitable interpretation, we conclude that <b>free</b> <b>will</b> is still not challenged...|$|R

25|$|Psychologist Daniel Wegner {{has argued}} that an introspection {{illusion}} contributes to belief in psychokinesis. He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to turn on a light) is followed by action (such as flicking a light switch) in a reliable way, but the underlying neural mechanisms are outside awareness. Hence, though subjects may feel that they directly introspect their <b>own</b> <b>free</b> <b>will,</b> the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory of apparent mental causation acknowledges the influence of David Hume's view of the mind. This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and when it goes wrong there can be an illusion of control. This can happen when an external event follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link. As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on magical thinking in which subjects were induced to think they had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a basketball player taking a series of free throws. When they were instructed to visualize him making his shots, they {{felt that they had}} contributed to his success. Other experiments designed to create an illusion of psychokinesis have demonstrated that this depends, to some extent, on the subject's prior belief in psychokinesis.|$|E
