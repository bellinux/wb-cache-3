5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty <b>of</b> <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> justice for {{shredding}} the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number}} of Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocephalus is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain. Hydrocephalus can occur because <b>of</b> <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> {{the passage of}} CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality. Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur. Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking. In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as {{the bones of the}} skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness. A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, which diverts fluid {{to another part of the}} body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.|$|E

40|$|Membranous <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> the {{inferior}} vena cava {{is a rare}} disease. The etiology of the membrane {{is believed to be}} thrombotic or congenital. In three of 11 siblings from a single family, symptoms <b>of</b> membranous <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> {{the inferior}} vena cava developed during early adult life. All had signs of more long-standing disease, as judged by the presence of collaterals, cirrhosis and, in one case, hepatocellular carcinoma. On family screening no further cases <b>of</b> membranous <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> the inferior vena cava were found. There was also no evidence of inherited defects in the natural coagulation inhibitors (protein C, protein S and antithrombin III) and plasminogen deficiency, This familial occurrence <b>of</b> membranous <b>obstruction</b> <b>of</b> the inferior vena cava supports a congenital etiology, although a thrombotic etiology cannot be totally excluded...|$|R

Epiglottitis is often managed with antibiotics, racemic epinephrine (a sympathomimetic bronchodilator that is delivered by aerosol), and may require tracheal intubation or a tracheostomy if breathing is difficult.
