Shoppers are attracted to scenery, smells, and sounds; the more pleasant the shopper feels the more they tend to spend. Past research by Morrin showed that pleasant scents can enhance cognition and cause people to better remember the details of products.20 Retail density (number of shoppers) {{was determined by the}} time of day and day of the week, while slow and fast music were played. A shopping experience can influence browsing behaviors and evaluations were highest with slow music and high density or fast music and low density.20 This random survey lends support to a [...] "schema incongruity theory" [...] stating that more elaborate information processing occurs under mildly incongruous conditions.

50|$|While {{conceptualizations of}} stress have differed, the most {{dominant}} accounts in current psychology are appraisal-based models of stress. These models define stress {{as a reaction to}} a certain type of subjective appraisal, done by an individual, of the circumstances he or she is in. Specifically, stress occurs when an individual decides that a factor in the environment puts demands on the individual beyond his or her current ability to deal with it. The process of rating situations as demanding or nondemanding is called appraisal, and this process can occur quickly and without conscious awareness. Appraisal models of stress are sometimes called “interactional” because the occurrence of stress depends <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> characteristics of the person, especially goals, and the environmental situation. Only if the individual perceives a situation to threaten his or her goals does stress occur. This structure explains the fact that individuals often differ in their emotional and stress responses when they are presented with similar situations. Stress does not come from events themselves, but from the conflict of the event with an individual’s goals. While researchers disagree about the time-course of appraisals, how appraisals are made, {{and the degree to which}} individuals differ in their appraisals, appraisal-models of stress are dominant in psychology. Appraisals may occur without conscious awareness. Stress itself is a systemic psychological state that includes a subjective “feel” and a motivational-component (the individual desires to reduce stress); some researchers consider stress to be a subset of or a closely related system to emotions, which likewise depend on appraisal and motivate behavior.|$|E

Amplitude does {{play a role}} in animal detection because accuracy suffers when amplitude is normalized. However, this effect could be due to an interaction between phase and amplitude, rather than to a loss of amplitude-only information. We used an amplitude-swapping paradigm to establish that animal detection is partly based <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> phase and amplitude. A difference in false alarms for two subsets of our distractor stimuli suggests that the classification of scene environment (man-made versus natural) may also be based <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> phase and amplitude. Examples of interaction between amplitude and phase are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{involvement}} of bradykinin, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, substance P and prostanoids in the hyperalgesia elicited by collagenase in rat paw was investigated. Collagenase (100 micrograms) induced a slight hyperalgesia in kininogen deficient rats {{in comparison with}} the behavioural response obtained in normal rats. Lisinopril (10 (- 5) M), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, increased the duration of the hyperalgesia elicited in normal rats. Ondansetron (0. 5 to 5 mumol/kg), a 5 -HT 3 antagonist, suppressed the hyperalgesia as did methysergide (1. 1 to 11 mumol/kg), a mixed 5 -HT 1 and 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist. However, the hyperalgesia was not modified by RP 67580 (1. 8 to 18 mumol/kg), a NK 1 receptor antagonist, and was only slightly delayed by indomethacin (2 mg/kg), a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor. The oedema-promoting effect of 5 -HT (6 nmol) was inhibited by methysergide but not by ondansetron. The swelling induced by collagenase in rat paw was reduced by methysergide but not by ondansetron. We conclude that the behavioural response induced by collagenase depends <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> bradykinin and 5 -HT.

30|$|One {{basic concept}} {{common to all}} {{interaction}} parameters {{is that they can}} only be measured based <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> a system and at least one user – for example during a laboratory or field test. The interaction is thus influenced by system and user characteristics and behaviour. As these aspects are interrelated they can usually not be separated. Consequently, interaction parameters will reflect not only the interaction but also the characteristics of the interlocutor. The requirements for recording interaction parameters are therefore similar to the ones applicable for experimental evaluation (cf. Section “Best practice and example evaluation” on best practice).|$|E

Prior to surgery, a position-dependent vertical ocular misalignment was present, and downward saccades were hypometric in the paretic eye. Strabismus surgery reduced the magnitude and position-dependence of the static misalignment. Saccade conjugacy improved in the patients with congenital pareses, and in the patient with a gradual-onset acquired paresis, but less improvement occurred in subjects with traumatic pareses. The post-operative change in saccade conjugacy relative to the change in static alignment correlated with pre-operative vertical vergence, suggesting that changes in saccade yoking depend <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> saccades and vertical vergence...|$|E
