5|$|The Battle of Borgerhout was {{a battle}} during the Eighty Years' War, of the Spanish Army of Flanders led by Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma, upon a {{fortified}} camp {{at the village}} of Borgerhout, near Antwerp, where several thousand French, English, Scottish and Walloon soldiers in service of the recently created Union of Utrecht were stationed. It {{took place during the}} reconquest by the armies of Philip II of Spain of the Burgundian Netherlands, whose different provinces had united in 1576 under the Pacification of Ghent to drive out the foreign troops <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> grant religious liberty to Protestants.|$|E
5|$|The reentry {{phenomenology}} was {{of interest}} {{both to the}} Army, as it might allow long-range decluttering to be carried <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the Air Force, whose own ICBMs might be at risk of long-range interception if the Soviets exploited a similar concept. A program to test these concepts was {{a major part of}} ARPA's Project Defender, especially Project PRESS, which started in 1960. This led to the construction of high-power radar systems on Roi-Namur, the northernmost point of the Kwajalein atoll. Although the results remain classified, several sources mention the failure to find a reliable signature of this sort.|$|E

5|$|Ferrara has {{proposed}} a number of redevelopments for the orphanage itself, and its surroundings. In 2004, he proposed a plan to redevelop the lot and building into 63 residential units. The proposed redevelopment was known as Glebe Gardens. Ferrara planned the construction of gardens and pools on the vacant grounds, but {{the front of the}} complex would face no development. Although the development application was approved by the city council, the plans were dropped because the costs to redevelop the lot were too great. In 2009, work began to revamp the orphanage and convert it into a retirement village, with trees being cleared to construct a retaining wall. Two metre high walls were going to be built to keep vandals <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> prevent further damage. He also stated {{that he was going to}} the fix up the orphanage once the proposed townhouses were under construction.|$|E
5|$|Minute {{traces of}} {{plutonium}} are usually {{found in the}} human body due to the 550 atmospheric and underwater nuclear tests that have been carried <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> a small number of major nuclear accidents. Most atmospheric and underwater nuclear testing was stopped by the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, which was signed and ratified by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and other nations. Continued atmospheric nuclear weapons testing since 1963 by non-treaty nations included those by China (atomic bomb test above the Gobi Desert in 1964, hydrogen bomb test in 1967, and follow-on tests), and France (tests as recently as the 1990s). Because it is deliberately manufactured for nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors, plutonium-239 is the most abundant isotope of plutonium by far.|$|E

They captured the culprits, {{who turned out to be}} young men from the town who had burned some cornstalks and were playing a joke on the people at the meeting to test their patriotism.|$|E

Then God touched Jeremiah's mouth and said that God had put words in his mouth and set him over the nations to root <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant. God asked Jeremiah what he saw, he replied that he saw the rod of an almond tree, and God said that he had seen well, for God watches over God's word to perform it.|$|E
25|$|The movement, {{like others}} in South Africa, has {{suffered}} sustained illegal harassment {{from the state}} {{that has resulted in}} more than 200 arrests of Abahlali members in the first last three years of its existence and repeated police brutality in people's homes, in the streets and in detention. On a number of occasions, the police used live ammunition, armoured vehicles and helicopters in their attacks on unarmed shack dwellers. In 2006 the local city manager, Mike Sutcliffe, unlawfully implemented a complete ban on Abahlali's right to march which was eventually overturned in court. Abahlali have been violently prevented from accepting invitations to appear on television and radio debates by the local police. The Freedom of Expression Institute has issued a number of statements in strong support of Abahlali's right to speak <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> organise protests. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions and a group of prominent church leaders have also issued public statements against police violence, as has Bishop Rubin Philip in his individual capacity, and in support of the right of the movement to publicly express dissent.|$|E
500|$|In fall 1941 the Nazis began {{transporting}} Jews {{out of the}} ghetto. Most {{of these}} were sent to Belzec extermination camp and killed. On 13 March 1943 the ghetto was liquidated and those still fit for work {{were sent to the}} new concentration camp at Płaszów. Several thousand not deemed fit for work were sent to extermination camps and killed. Hundreds more were killed on the streets by the Nazis as they cleared out the ghetto. Schindler, aware of the planned action because of his Wehrmacht contacts, had his workers stay at the factory overnight to prevent them coming to any harm. Schindler witnessed the liquidation of the ghetto and was appalled. From that point forward, says Schindlerjude Sol Urbach, Schindler [...] "changed his mind about the Nazis. He decided to get <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> save as many Jews as he could." ...|$|E

At the assembly, New Directions perform Kesha's [...] "Tik Tok", but the song comes {{to an abrupt end}} when Brittany (Heather Morris) and Santana (Naya Rivera) throw up from intoxication. Figgins later rewards the club for their performance's success in scaring their fellow students into sobriety, in the belief that the glee club had been acting during the assembly. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) publicly humiliates Will by playing the message he left on her voice mail—not Emma's, as he had meant to do—over the school's public address system while classes are in session. Will realizes that it is hypocritical to tell the students not to abuse alcohol when he does so himself, and convinces the entire club to pledge not to drink until after their upcoming Nationals competition. He tells them he will also abstain, and urges them to call him for a ride home if they do drink, regardless of where they are or how late it is.|$|E
500|$|On a {{slightly}} less positive note, Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode with a B+. He remarked that it [...] "starts out intense and crazy" [...] but [...] "becomes fairly predictable {{in its second}} half," [...] as he correctly predicted Walternate's involvement in the abduction. Murray concluded, [...] "Ultimately, 'Bloodline' {{is more of a}} plot-mover than most episodes of Fringe. There’s no additional case to solve, and no profound theme to explore. If anything, it’s like the writers decided to inject a serum into the belly of show and accelerate the story, to get Fauxlivia’s baby <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> get on to the next phase." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler also didn't find the birth storyline all that shocking [...] "since {{the number of people that}} had the power and knowledge to do this kind of thing was low." [...] Rating the episode 7.5/10, Isler added that [...] "the story could have used a bit more misdirection and a red herring or two to really keep us guessing, but that's a minor critique. Overall, Walternate's Machiavellian role in this story works, and the most important takeaway from this story is that it moved the overarching plot forward in one huge leap. Instead of waiting nine 'story' months for Fauxlivia's baby to pop out, we've already got the kid ready to fit into whatever plot twist the show runners have planned." ...|$|E
