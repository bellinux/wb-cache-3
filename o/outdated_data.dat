5000|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} a moderate statistical correlation between differences in IQ and brain size between individuals in the same group. [...] And some scholars have reported differences in average brain sizes between Africans, Europeans and Asians. [...] J. P. Rushton has argued that Africans on average have smaller brain cases and brains than Europeans, and that Europeans have smaller brains than East Asians, and that this is evidence that the gap is biological in nature. Critics of Rushton have argued that Rushton's arguments rest on <b>outdated</b> <b>data</b> collected by unsound methods and should be considered invalid. Recent reviews by [...] and [...] consider that current data does show an average difference in brain size and head-circumference between American Blacks and Whites, but question whether this has any relevance for the IQ gap. Nesbitt et al. argue that crude brain size is unlikely to be a good measure of IQ; for example, brain size also differs between men and women, but without well documented differences in IQ. At the same time newborn Black children have the same average brain size as Whites, suggesting that the difference in average size could be accounted for by differences in postnatal environment. Several factors that reduce brain size have been demonstrated to disproportionately affect Black children.|$|E
5000|$|Hardware {{related issues}} cause lag {{due to the}} {{fundamental}} structure of the game architecture. Generally, games consist of a looped sequence of states, or [...] "frames". During each frame, the game accepts user input and performs necessary calculations (AI, graphics etc.). When all processing is finished, the game will update the game state and produce an output, such as a new image on the screen and/or a packet {{to be sent to}} the server. The frequency at which frames are generated {{is often referred to as}} the frame rate. As the central game state is located on the server, the updated information must be sent from the client to the server in order to take effect. In addition, the client must receive the necessary information from the server in order to fully update the state. Generating packets to send to the server and processing the received packets can only be done as often as the client is able to update its local state. Although packets could theoretically be generated and sent faster than this, it would only result in sending redundant data if the game state cannot be updated between each packet. A low frame rate would therefore make the game less responsive to updates and may force it to skip <b>outdated</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E

We show that {{the length of the}} times between controller updates as computed from the proposed scheme is strictly positive and provide examples. I...|$|R

Computed color indices and {{spectral}} shapes {{for individual}} stars are routinely compared with observations for essentially all spectral types, but absolute fluxes are rarely tested.
