25|$|The {{history of}} nuclear energy {{economics}} in the UK is complex.

Costs have also been complicated {{by the lack of}} national strategy <b>or</b> <b>policy</b> for spent nuclear fuel, so that a mixed use of reprocessing and short-term storage have been employed, with little regard for long-term considerations (although a national repository has been proposed).|$|E

25|$|In 1993, Harris {{and other}} Ontario Greens sought {{and won a}} change in the party's {{constitution}} allowing for the election of a full-time leader.

Harris stood for the leadership, and lost to Frank de Jong. De Jong later supported Harris in his bid to become federal leader, while Harris endorsed de Jong's bid for re-election as provincial leader in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Media {{reports in}} May 2009 {{concerning}} Friedman's involvement with Goldman, and in particular, his {{purchase of the}} firm's stock when it traded at historical lows {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2008, fueled controversy and criticism over what was seen as a conflict of interest in Friedman's new role as supervisor and regulator to Goldman Sachs. These events prompted his resignation on May 7, 2009. Although Friedman's purchases of Goldman stock did not violate any Fed rule, statute, <b>or</b> <b>policy,</b> he said that the Fed did not need this distraction. He also stated his purchases, made while approval of a waiver was pending, were motivated by a desire to demonstrate confidence in the company during a time of market distress.|$|E

A key common feature of the anti-Keynesian schools of thought is that they argued for policy ineffectiveness <b>or</b> <b>policy</b> irrelevance.
