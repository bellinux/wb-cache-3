5|$|Since midnight {{the weapons}} {{on all the}} fronts are silent. By {{the order of the}} Grand Admiral Dönitz, the Wehrmacht ceased its hopeless fighting. With this, a nearly 6-year heroic {{struggle}} has ended. It brought us great victories but also heavy defeats. The Wehrmacht has been honorably defeated by superior forces. The German soldier, in accordance with his oath, has given his unforgettable effort to his people. Till the end the homeland supported him with all its strength, under the heaviest sacrifices. The singular performance of the front and Fatherland shall receive its final honor in the later, fair judgement. The achievements and sacrifices of German soldiers at sea, on the land and in the air has not escaped the notice of our enemy.

They finally locate a research centre {{where they can}} activate Bodhidharma's DNA in Aravind, and decide to hide {{there for a few}} days.

Subha and her friends in the research centre escape in a van, but Dong Lee chases them and the van collapses. An unconscious Aravind gets beaten badly by Dong Lee at first, but then gains Bodhidharma's skills and kills Dong Lee. Aravind uses an ancient medicine to cure the disease.

500|$|Prior to the {{dismantling}} project, there was debate by local residents {{on whether the}} wrecked stern should be removed.

Arnie Roblan, a state representative from Coos Bay, called the wreck a potential tourist attraction. For some residents, uncertainty remained surrounding Titan's removal plan, with the worry that the stern {{would be unable to}} withstand the force of the hydraulic pullers and that parts of the ship already buried in the sand would be unmovable. The president of the Coos Bay city council expressed concern that the proposed removal operation could cause ecological damage that would not occur if the ship were left on the beach. He further noted that [...] "shipwrecks on the Oregon Coast are part <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>history.</b> There are a lot of ways you could better spend the money here." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{occupation}} of Serbia by the Central Powers pained Bojić {{far more than}} the everyday struggles of the exodus itself. He is said to have slept very little, telling Živadinović: [...] "You don't realize what you are missing by sleeping. In circumstances like these, the entire soul must be kept constantly awake. Whole centuries have never painted such a vast fresco. Never has death been so greedy, nor heroes so indifferent to it." [...] In December 1915, Bojić reached Shëngjin with the others and reunited with his fiancée. Živadinović recalled: [...] "I shall never forget the day that we saw the sea. Only then did Bojić begin to speak about the future. He was making plans for a vast novel in verse, for comedies, dramas, tragedies, all intended to bring the great events <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>history</b> back to life." [...] Upon reaching the coast, Bojić was told that he could not board the ship to Italy because he was of fighting age. His fiancée was allowed to board and his fifteen-year-old brother was judged to be too young for military service and granted passage as well. Unable to go with them, Bojić and his companions continued {{down the length of the}} Albanian coast until they reached Corfu, where the Allies had sent ships to transport the remnants of the Serbian Army to the Greek mainland.|$|E
500|$|HMS Belfast, a Town class cruiser, was {{launched}} in 1938 and served throughout the Second World War, participating in the December 1943 Battle of North Cape and firing {{some of the first}} shots of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944. She saw further combat in the Korean War. Expected to be disposed of as scrap after she was decommissioned in 1963, in 1967 efforts were initiated to preserve Belfast as a museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum and the Ministry of Defence was established, and reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971 the government decided against preservation, prompting the formation of the private HMS Belfast Trust to campaign for her to be saved for the nation. The Trust was successful in its efforts, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the River Thames near Tower Bridge in the Pool of London. Opened to the public in October 1971 Belfast became a branch of the Imperial War Museum on 1 March 1978, being acknowledged by the then Secretary of State for Education and Science, Shirley Williams, as 'a unique demonstration of an important phase <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>history</b> and technology'.
