40|$|SummaryThe {{study of}} <b>oculomotricity</b> {{is done by}} the {{evaluation}} of three systems: saccade eye movements (MOS), optokinetic nystagmus (NO) and smooth pursuit eye movement (MORL). The joint action of these three systems allows the visual field’s establishment in different movement situations. Aim: To compare the value of <b>oculomotricity</b> in normal adults and children to confirm, or not if it is viable to use the same parameters of adults normality to children’s exams interpretation. Study design: clinical with transversal cohort. Material and Method: We studied MOS, NO and MORL in 50 normal children and in 35 adults and the results were compared by the t Student test. Results: The data analysis showed significant difference between children and adults (significance at level ± = 0. 05) Discussion: In the literature we have found evidence that myelinization of the vestibular pathways happen at about 16 weeks and the pyramidal tracts, at 24 months. <b>Oculomotricity</b> is finished at this time. Other papers describe the importance of these tests in the diagnostic of neurological diseases, visual alterations and as predictors of the risk of schizophrenia development but they do not report the normal range in children. In our study we found increased latency of MOS, increase in gain of NO, reduction in gain and increase in the distortion of MORL in children if compared to adults, which is in accordance with the literature. These alterations {{can be explained by the}} low attention during the tests and the immaturity of ocular movements’ control in children. Conclusion: Therefore, the establishment of a parameter of normality to the <b>oculomotricity</b> in childhood is necessary for the correct analysis of the oculography to avoid misinterpretation of the exam...|$|E
40|$|The saccadic pathway {{involves}} numerous {{regions of}} the brain cortex, the cerebellum and the brainstem. Saccadic movement latency, velocity and precision parameters assess the efficacy of central nervous system (CNS) control over rapid eye movements. Very few disorders which alter the CNS are missed when these parameters are carefully measured using a computer. Pendular tracking assesses {{the integrity of the}} oculomotor system in controlling slow eye movements - vulnerable to CNS and vestibular system dysfunctions. Optokinetic nystagmus represents a stereoceptive response which compensates environment movements by psycho-optical inputs. AIMS: to compare the <b>oculomotricity</b> values found in children with and without learning complaints. MATERIALS AND METHODS: prospective study. We included in the study 28 children of both genders, within the age range between 8 and 12 years, with learning disorders (study group) and 15 without (control group). We carried out the fixed and randomized saccadic movement tests, pendular tracking study and optokinetic nystagmus. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the groups concerning the randomized saccadic movement velocity parameters and in the pendular tracking test. CONCLUSION: The children with learning disorders presented alterations in some <b>oculomotricity</b> tests when compared to children without complaints...|$|E
40|$|Many medicines, {{mainly with}} {{neurological}} purpose, {{interfere with the}} <b>oculomotricity.</b> The biochemistry of the oculomotor systems and thus, the mechanisms of action of these drug interferences are not completely clarified. Most medicines impair the eye movements {{at the level of}} their fine adjustment by feed-back loops implying the cerebellum. Quite often, the interferences remain asymptomatic, restricted to a saccadic pursuit, hypometric saccades or an end-point nystagmus. Sometimes however, symptoms of dizziness or oscillopsia appear, due to loss of the vestibulo-ocular reflexes efficiency. A diplopia or a blurred vision by double outline could be suggestive of an ocular motor paresis or a loss of the binocular fusion due to drugs action.

40|$|Several structures, {{located at}} {{different}} levels in the Central Nervous System (CNS), collaborate to the control and realization of ocular movements (O. M.) Therefore, alterations of <b>oculomotricity,</b> of varying degree and of different kinds, {{may be found in}} a lot of diseases of the CNS. The study of O. M., expecially when carried out by means of specific techniques such as electro-oculography, may represent an useful tool in the diagnosis (both from a topographic and an etiological standpoint) and in the follow-up of patients, possibly also allowing a precise evaluation of therapy effectiveness. In this review the Authors briefly examine the role of the supranuclear structures mostly involved in the control and in the execution of <b>oculomotricity</b> and the characteristics of the different types of O. M. (rapid and slow, vergence movements). Successively, they analyze the semeiological features of supra-nuclear disturbances of O. M., describing alterations of saccadic movements (slowing, dysmetria) and of smooth pursuit, fixation instability (square waves, flutter, opsoclonus, nystagmus, [...] .) and other alterations of O. M. (ocular bobbing, see-saw nystagmus, skew deviation, [...] .). Successively, disturbances of O. M. are analyzed in relation to their topodiagnostic significance, describing oculomotor involvements due to focal lesions of different areas of CNS (frontal cortex, parieto-occipital cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, brainstem) and particular syndromes (Foville syndromes, locked-in syndrome, Parinaud syndrome, anterior internuclear ophthalmoplegia, "one and a half" syndrome, Balint syndrome, [...] .). Finally, particular attention is drawn to the oculomotor disturbances observed in degenerative cerebellar and multisystemic diseases, and several abnormal "oculomotor patterns", which seem to be specifically related to particular diseases, are described. In particular, the oculomotor patterns of Steele-Richardson-Olszewsky disease (slowing and hypometria of horizontal saccades, loss of upward saccades with preservation of reflex movements) and of Friedreich ataxia (fixation instability mostly due to the occurrence of square waves, saccadic dysmetria, impairment of smooth pursuit) are stressed...|$|E
40|$|Eye Movement Metrics in the Differentiation of Parkinsonian Syndromes Cecilia Bonnet, MD Summary of thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Ph. D., Charles University, Prague 2017 In this thesis we investigated conjugate and dis-conjugate eye movements (EM) in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other parkinsonian syndromes aiming to characterize and differentiate some aspects of their <b>oculomotricity</b> using infrared video-oculography. First of all we published a practical review for medical students and clinicians describing clinical examination of eye movements, and interpretation of principal findings. Then we examined principal saccadic eye movements and smooth pursuit in the horizontal and vertical directions with video-oculography in {{a large group of}} healthy subjects, aiming to help new oculomotor laboratories in the constitution of their own norms. We conclude that age influence EM metrics but not gender or education level. The latency of saccades and the error rate of antisaccaes increases, while the velocity and gain diminishes with age. Saccades should be investigated in the horizontal and vertical plane because they are influenced by the direction of the target, resulting in a right/left and up/down asymmetry. In a third project we focused on a frequent complain of PD patients, namely blurred near vision and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies showed}} {{a link between}} {{cerebral}} small vessel white matter disease (SVD) and dizziness: patients whose dizziness cannot be explained by vestibular disease show severe SVD and gait abnormalities; however, little is still known about how SVD can cause this symptom. The primary {{aim of this study}} is to examine the possible underlying causes of dizziness in neurovascular patients; this is in order to assess whether treatable causes could be routinely disregarded. A secondary aim is to possibly define a central oculomotor pattern induced per se by SVD. This could help the diagnosis of SVD-related dizziness. In this single-blind prospective study, 60 patients referred to a neurovascular clinic because of dizziness and SVD on imaging were divided into an L-SVD and a H-SVD group (low and high SVD burden, respectively), and then blindly examined with vestibulometric tests. In H-SVD group, the percentage of unexplained dizziness reached 82. 8 %. There was a higher prevalence of peripheral vestibular abnormalities in the L-SVD patient group (51. 6 %) than in the H-SVD (17. 2 %; p = 0. 012). We found no differences in central oculomotor findings between the two groups. Although <b>oculomotricity</b> does not show any consistent pattern, a severe SVD can directly represent a cause of dizziness. However, a patient with mild SVD is more likely to suffer by a peripheral vestibular disorder. Therefore, given the high incidence of vestibular disease in neurovascular or geriatric clinics, clinicians should be cautious when ascribing dizziness solely to the presence of SVD as easily treatable peripheral vestibular causes may be missed...|$|E
40|$|Objective:Gauchers {{disease is}} a rare genetic {{disorder}} that results in the accumulation of cerebrosides in the liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs, brain and bone marrow. The deficiency of the specific lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase is considered as causative factor. The first effective treatment for the disease, the drug Ceredase, approved in 1995, was replaced in 2001 by the drug Cerezyme®. Methods:During the period 2004 - 2009 in our service 11 children were hospitalized and treated for Gaucher's disease: 9 children with type 1, and 2 children with type 3 of the disease. The enzymatic examinations of the biomarker chitotriosidase were performed in Sahlgrens University Hospital, Mölndal Sweden; the DNA analysis was performed in the Childrens Hospital & Regional Medical Center, Seattle, USA. Findings:We are presenting the biological and genetic molecular data of the children. In our case series, {{one year after the}} treatment started, the hemoglobin level was normalized; the platelet count was normalized in 7 patients after one year of treatment, and in 9 patients after two years of treatment. The hemorrhagic syndrome stopped after 6 months of treatment. Chitotriosidase values decreased 10 - 20 times the initial value, after one year of treatment and in one case the value reached the normal range. The treatment with Cerezyme® has also improved the visceral and biological signs. Anomalies of the <b>oculomotricity</b> were less sensitive to the treatment. Conclusion:According to our experience, Chitotriosidase is a sensitive and specific marker in diagnosing and monitoring Gauchers disease. The enzyme replacement therapy through Cerezyme® is an effective and safe treatment of Gauchers disease. Blood signs (anemia, platelet count); visceral signs (splenomegaly, hepatomegaly) as well as bone involvement showed decisive improvement under the therapy...|$|E
40|$|Objective: OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the clinical, laboratory and electrophysiological {{features of a}} patient who presented an Avellis syndrome as the initial feature of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS). Background: BACKGROUND: Anti-GQ 1 b Ig antibodies are associated with an increasing spectrum of neurological disorders, including MFS and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). Design/Methods: DESIGN/METHODS: Clinical case description. Results: RESULTS: A 67 -year old woman was seen for subacute dysphagia and dysphonia, preceded by rapidly worsening paresthesia of the extremities and face, {{with a history of}} upper respiratory tract infection two weeks before admission. Nasotracheal examination showed a left velopalatine and left vocal cord paresis. Twelve hours later, sensory ataxia appeared and deep tendon reflexes weakened. Diffuse paresis affecting predominantly the axial muscles developped. <b>Oculomotricity</b> was preserved. Brain MRI was normal, while EMG suggested a mild sensory neuropathy. Within hours, dysphagia worsened and dyspnea appeared, prompting ICU admission for airway support. She developed a proximal paresis and dysautonomia, global areflexia. CSF findings were unremarkable. IVIg were administered at a dose of 0. 2 g/kg per day during five days. Control EMG showed signs of polyradiculoneuropathy. She gradually recovered and was discharged at home after 32 days, with only a slight velopalatal paresis and a mild fatigue. Anti-ganglioside antibodies screen was positive for IgG-GM 3, GD 1 b, GD 3, GQ 1 b, GT 1 a and GT 1 b. In front of this clinical and biological picture, the diagnosis of atypical MFS was retained. Thirty day after discharge, both clinical and electrophysiological parameters were normalised. Conclusions: CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights that (i) MFS can show atypical presentation (here a pure Avellis syndrome, never reported {{in the context of the}} anti-GQ 1 b syndrome to our knowledge) and should be considered in front of an isolated impaired cranial nerve function, even in the absence of the classical triad of ophtalmoplegia, areflexia and ataxia, and (ii) that the boundaries between MFS and GBS are usually neater in textbooks than in real life.
