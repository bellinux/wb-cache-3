40|$|A {{desk top}} {{analysis}} was conducted to assess the feasibility and economics of introducing a <b>fully</b> <b>mechanised</b> combine harvesting system on several farms of a miller cum planter estate located in the KwaZulu Natal Midlands of South Africa. Machinery and equipment costing exercises based on row length, haul-out distance and harvester forward speeds were investigated. The outcome of the study indicated that the success and economic viability of introducing a <b>fully</b> <b>mechanised</b> combine harvesting system is largely dependant on the harvester’s output, reliability and the overall management of the proposed system.

50|$|Foxfield, {{along with}} the rest of the coal {{industry}} was nationalised in 1947, and the pit entered a period of expansion where by 1954 the workforce stood at 550 with 210,000 tonnes mined a year.However, this was the high water mark and gradually output and manpower decreased. In 1965 Foxfield Colliery was closed by the National Coal Board. The colliery had nearly exhausted its economic reserves, and as it was not <b>fully</b> <b>mechanised,</b> the board decided to transfer the majority of the miners to Florence Colliery in Longton where a <b>fully</b> <b>mechanised</b> face in the Moss Seam was prepared for the Foxfield men.Foxfield Colliery is still standing, and today is owned by the Foxfield Steam Railway who run heritage steam traction to the site.|$|R

40|$|This IPIN {{presents}} {{results from}} a time study of final overstorey harvesting in a Continuous Cover Forestry (CCF) uniform shelterwood of Sitka spruce. This operation used mechanised harvesting in tree sizes with a mean dbh of 42 cm amongst well developed natural regeneration. Motor manual felling was required for trees beyond the capacity of harvester felling, due to diameter and/or coarse branching. Shortwood harvesting was carried out {{with the aim of}} removing the overstorey and releasing the well developed (natural regeneration) understorey. A John Deere 1270 D harvester was used for felling and timber extraction was carried out with a John Deere 1110 D forwarder. The mature overstorey included many large trees, consequently <b>mechanised</b> <b>harvester</b> outputs were high at 30. 15 m 3 OB/shr 1 at a cost of £ 2. 30 per m 3 OB. Motor manual felling and partial processing to assist the harvester produced an output of 8. 50 m 3 OB/shr at a cost of £ 3. 07 per m 3 OB (an addition of £ 0. 35 per m 3 OB proportionally across the study area). Forwarding outputs were also high at 18. 63 m 3 OB/ 100 m for extraction to roadside at a cost of £ 2. 88 per m 3 OB/ 100 m. Harvesting was carried out with good integration of motor manual and mechanised techniques.

40|$|Abstract：Chain Pillars serving {{longwall}} face {{is an important}} factor influencing the stability of the roadway surrounding rock in the <b>fully</b> <b>mechanised</b> caving {{longwall face}}. The reasonable width of the section coal pillar is proposed, combined with the theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and field measurement for the <b>fully</b> <b>mechanised</b> caving longwall face in thick seam in Jinzhuang coal mine. Results of the numerical simulation show that when the width of the section pillar increases to 24 m, there is an 8 m wide elastic zone in the coal pillar and a saddle-shaped vertical stress distribution, which shows that the coal pillar can maintain its stability. So the reasonable width of the coal pillar is 24 m, which is close to the result of theoretical calculation (23 m). The field observations also illustrate that the 30 m wide coal pillars in the first mining face is too large resulting in a waste of resources...|$|R

30|$|About 3000 {{million tonnes}} of coal is {{locked up in}} {{standing}} pillars (Dixit and Mishra 2010) under varying geo-mining conditions, which is prime target of the mining industry {{to meet the demand}} of coal production. Present pillar extraction (depillaring) practices of the country have, predominantly, adopted intermediate mechanisation along with few <b>fully</b> <b>mechanised</b> depillaring faces. Most of these faces are operating at shallow cover. But the existing technoeconomical conditions of the industry are attracting a <b>fully</b> <b>mechanised</b> depillaring system for deep seated coal pillars, which is likely to grow in near future (Singh et al. 2011 a). In Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL), about 60 % of coal is locked up in standing pillars formed by Bord and Pillar method (Internal Reports on BG method in the SCCL). About 50 % of coal reserves in India are in seams thicker than 4.5  m, which come under the category of thick seams, the exploitation of which is consistently posing challenges to the mining engineers. Extraction of thick seams by conventional hand section method is neither productive nor effective from the conservation point of view (heavy loss of coal by conventional hand-section method). The percentage of extraction by hand section mining in thick seams is as low as 25 – 30 %.|$|R
50|$|The {{quality of}} a weld depends, besides the weld {{parameters}} which are important for the welding process (e.g. voltage, current, wire feed and weld speed) also mainly from the type of input of process energy and of the used filler material. The positioning of the torch exerts a direct influence on the material flow. The heat input for the melting of the component edges and the steady heat flow are, furthermore, directly connected with the torch guidance and exert substantical influence on the weld quality and on the resulting residual stresses.In <b>fully</b> <b>mechanised</b> and automated shielded gas welding, the inaccuracies of torch guidance, workpiece handling, groove preparation and thermal distortion are adding to the variations of the edge position and edge geometry. In <b>fully</b> <b>mechanised</b> welding, the information which {{is required for the}} weld quality is detected via sensors. Sensors are applied for checking the position of the component (detection of weld start and end of weld), for joint tracking and for the adaptation of the process parameters to changes of the joints/grooves. It is possible to use the sensors online (together/at the same time with the welding process) or offline (in a separate working step before welding). Sensors are mainly used in online joint tracking.|$|R

40|$|This study uses {{energy and}} {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) balances to evaluate how {{the scale of}} sugarcane cultivation affects {{the performance of a}} sugarcane bioenergy system generating exportable electricity from bagasse. Small-, medium-, large- and miller-planter systems, with cane field areas of less than 10 ha, 10 – 42 ha, 42 – 2000 ha, more than 2000 ha respectively, were modelled. Each of them also has different combinations of manual and mechanical agricultural operations, resulting in different cane yields. Miller-planter system (<b>fully</b> <b>mechanised)</b> performs best with energy yield ratio of 10. 99, GHG emissions in bagasse electricity of 0. 0633 kg CO 2 eq/kWh and avoided life cycle GHG emissions of 82. 07 % when replacing electricity from coal, whereas small-planter system (fully manual) has the worst performance with energy yield ratio of 6. 82, GHG emissions in bagasse electricity of 0. 0881 kg CO 2 eq/kWh and avoided life cycle GHG emissions of 75. 03 % when substituting electricity from coal. Sensitivity analyses show that relative performances of all sugarcane planter systems both in terms of energy and GHG emissions are not significantly affected by variations in bagasse allocation factor, in sugarcane yield and in fertiliser input (the most energy-intensive and GHG-emitting component). Moreover, they confirm miller-planter system as the overall best performer and indicate that increasing small-planters’ cane yield is the critical measure to improve their energy analysis performance. In terms of the nature of agricultural operations, mechanical operations do not necessarily require more input energy than their manual counterparts, contrary to common belief. This is the case for fertilisation, irrigation and cane loading. <b>Fully</b> <b>mechanised</b> sugarcane production at miller-planter scale is therefore strongly encouraged...|$|R
