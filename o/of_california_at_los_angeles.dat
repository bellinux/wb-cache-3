5|$|Fletcher Joseph Perry {{was born}} in Stephens, Arkansas, {{and grew up in}} Los Angeles, California, after his family moved there during the Great Depression. He was a four-sport star at David Starr Jordan High School in Los Angeles. Perry grew up admiring several African-American athletes at the University <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> (UCLA), {{including}} Jackie Robinson, who played football and baseball and ran track for the university. After being rejected by UCLA, Perry played football at Compton Junior College in 1944, and scored 22 touchdowns that season. He was then recruited by UCLA, but declined, and enlisted in the Navy during World War II. He played football in the military for Naval Air Station Alameda. In an East vs. West college all-star game in January 1948, Perry scored on a four-yard run in the first quarter for the West, which also featured Bobby Layne of Texas and Jake Leicht of Oregon.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{antibodies}} {{have been developed}} that induce lethal iron deprivation (LID) by targeting the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR 1 /CD 71) and either neutralizing transferrin (Tf) binding, blocking internalization of the receptor and/or inducing its degradation. We have developed recombinant antibodies targeting human TfR 1 (ch 128. 1 and ch 128. 1 Av), which induce receptor degradation and are cytotoxic to certain malignant B-cells. We now show that internalization of TfR 1 bound to these antibodies can lead to its sequestration and degradation, as well as reduced Tf uptake, and the induction of a transcriptional response consistent with iron deprivation, which is mediated in part by downstream targets of p 53. Cells resistant to these antibodies do not sequester and degrade TfR 1 after internalization of the antibody/receptor complex, and accordingly maintain their ability to internalize Tf. These findings are expected to facilitate the rational design and clinical use of therapeutic agents targeting iron import via TfR 1 in hematopoietic malignancies.

40|$|Breast and {{ovarian cancer}} {{are two of}} the leading causes of cancer deaths among women in the United States. Overexpression of the HER 2 /neu oncoprotein has been {{reported}} in patients affected with breast and ovarian cancers, and is associated with poor prognosis. To develop a novel targeted therapy for HER 2 /neu expressing tumors, we have constructed a fully human IgE with the variable regions of the scFv C 6 MH 3 -B 1 specific for HER 2 /neu. This antibody was expressed in murine myeloma cells and was properly assembled and secreted. The Fc region of this antibody triggers in vitro degranulation of rat basophilic cells expressing human FcεRI (RBL SX- 38) in the presence of murine mammary carcinoma cells that express human HER 2 /neu (D 2 F 2 /E 2), but not the shed (soluble) antigen (ECDHER 2) alone. This IgE is also capable of inducing passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in a human FcεRIα transgenic mouse model, {{in the presence of a}} cross-linking antibody, but not in the presence of soluble ECDHER 2. Additionally, IgE enhances antigen presentation in human dendritic cells and facilitates cross-priming, suggesting that the antibody is able to stimulate a secondary T-cell anti-tumor response. Furthermore, we show that this IgE significantly prolongs survival of human FcεRIα transgenic mice bearing D 2 F 2 /E 2 tumors. We also report that the anti-HER 2 /neu IgE is well tolerated in a preliminary study conducted in Macaca fascicularis (cynomolgus) monkeys. In summary, our results suggest that this IgE should be further explored as a potential therapeutic against HER 2 /neu overexpressing tumors, such as breast and ovarian cancers.

40|$|Multiple myeloma (MM) is {{an incurable}} disease of {{malignant}} plasma cells. Recent therapeutic advancements {{have resulted in}} improved response rates, however, there is no improvement in overall survival, therefore, new therapeutics are needed. Since the transferrin receptor is upregulated {{on the surface of}} MM cells, we previously developed an antibody fusion protein consisting of an IgG 3 specific for the human transferrin receptor 1 (TfR 1, CD 71) genetically fused to avidin at its carboxy-terminus (ch 128. 1 Av). We have previously shown that ch 128. 1 Av exhibits intrinsic cytotoxicity against certain malignant B-cells by disrupting the cycling of the TfR and decreasing TfR cell surface expression resulting in lethal iron starvation. In addition, ch 128. 1 Av can sensitize malignant cells to apoptosis induced by gambogic acid, a herbal drug used in Chinese medicine. In this study, we hypothesized that ch 128. 1 Av may also sensitize drug-resistant malignant B-cells to chemotherapeutic agents by inhibiting key survival pathways. In this study we show that ch 128. 1 Av sensitizes malignant B-cells to apoptosis induced by cisplatin (CDDP). The sensitization by ch 128. 1 Av resulted in the inhibition of the constitutively activated Akt and NF-κB survival/antiapoptotic pathways and downstream decreased expression of antiapoptotic gene products such as BclxL and survivin. The direct role of the inhibition of the Akt and NF-κB pathways by ch 128. 1 Av in CDDP-mediated cytotoxicity was demonstrated by the use of specific chemical inhibitors and siRNA which mimicked the effects of ch 128. 1 Av. Overall, this study provides evidence of the therapeutic potential of ch 128. 1 Av as a chemo-sensitizing agent in drug-resistant tumor cells. Fil: Suzuki, Eriko.

The expert stated that although the lyrics and verse melodies of the two songs were different, the songs' choruses [...] "shared a 'basic shape and pitch emphasis' in their melodies, which were played over 'highly similar basslines' and chord changes, at very nearly the same tempo and in the same generic style." [...] He noted both the songs had their choruses sung in the key of B.
