5|$|The woman {{wears an}} elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur {{at the neck}} and wrist. Her clothes are of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the tall and thin {{aesthetic}} of the Gothic ideal. Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E
25|$|Mary is {{depicted}} {{sitting on a}} stool, with a slightly oversized Christ child figure sitting on her lap. She wears a tight, long-sleeved tunic and a cloak (palla) drawn <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> On her head she wears a veil, the ends of which are covered by the cloak. In her right hand she holds aloft a globe with her thumb and two fingers, while her left hand supports the infant in her lap. The Christ figure himself wears a pontifical gown and presses a book against his breast with his left hand.|$|E
500|$|Davidson further {{compares to}} early {{attestations}} of the Irish goddesses Badb (Davidson {{points to the}} description of Badb from The Destruction of Da Choca's Hostel where Badb is wearing a dusky mantle, has a large mouth, is dark in color, and has gray hair falling <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> or, alternatively, [...] "as a red figure {{on the edge of}} the ford, washing the chariot of a king doomed to die") and The Morrígan. Davidson concludes that, in these examples, [...] "here we have the fierce destructive side of death, with a strong emphasis on its physical horrors, so perhaps we should not assume that the gruesome figure of Hel is wholly Snorri's literary invention." ...|$|E

500|$|The single cover artwork for [...] "Obsessed" [...] {{features}} Carey {{leaning against}} a dirty concrete wall. She is shown wearing black underwear and a matching sheer top, with a black bra visible through the shirt. Carey's hair is featured in a long and wet style, cascading <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> and right breast. The word [...] "Obsessed" [...] is written in large white letters over Carey's body. An anonymous writer for MTV described it as [...] "wet and raunchy", while writing, [...] "As {{you can see here}} the star has chosen a sexy shot to launch material from her next album. Mariah is shown busting out of a revealing black top and wearing black underwear." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 31, 2013, Gaga {{revealed}} via Twitter that [...] "Dope" [...] {{would be}} the final song available for purchase before the release of Artpop, accessible for digital download from November 4. The single's cover art was also revealed, depicting Gaga wearing a black floppy hat with her brunette hair falling <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> an oversized [...] "boxy" [...] double-breasted blazer, sheer underwear, one black leather boot and a grill that made her teeth appear larger. Her eyes are covered by a scarf and she has bruises on her belly and around her crotch area. Idolator writer Mike Wass named the cover art [...] "a cross between Frankenstein and Michael Jackson". Matthew Jacobs from The Huffington Post found the cover relatively modest compared to the previous single covers of songs from Artpop. John Walker from MTV News compared the cover to director Tim Burton's works and called it [...] "terrifying". He described Gaga's face and the grills as [...] " [...] the gum-less teeth of a long-buried skull cast in titanium" [...] and believed that the hands and legs were prosthetic. Walker concluded {{by saying that the}} cover reminded him of a [...] "bizarro world" [...] version of singer Janet Jackson's [...] for a 1993 Rolling Stone issue. Lily Harrison from E! Online complimented Gaga for taking the fashion of grills to a [...] "whole new level". She commended the singer's ability to portray her toned figure in spite of the [...] "odd ensemble". A writer for Metro felt that the singer was as [...] "peculiar as ever" [...] on the artwork. Emma Kelly from Daily Star called the cover [...] "creepier" [...] than any horror film and felt that the wide jacket made the singer appear as a rugby player. She compared the digitally altered smile on the single cover to the cover of electronic musician Aphex Twin's EP, Come to Daddy (1997) which features similar inflated grills. Fashion website Refinery29's Leila Brillson felt that the artwork was more of a surrealist move which made Gaga look like a [...] "nightmarish" [...] version of virtual band Gorillaz. Brillson was also unclear if the bruises were related to the song.|$|E
