5|$|After the discovery, Libby Sheldon of University College London {{conducted}} several {{tests to}} verify the painting's age, including spectroscopy and laser microscopy. The age of the inscription was taken into consideration, and found to be contemporaneous {{with the rest of}} the painting. Pigments, including a type of yellow pigment rarely found after 1600, were appropriate for the 16th century. Dendrochronological analysis later showed that the work was too late to be a life portrait of Jane, but did not rule out the possibility <b>of</b> <b>reproduction.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not known}} with {{certainty}} how the spores are dispersed, they may disperse passively in the water, or a mature spore-containing fruit body may float on the water surface for dispersal.

5|$|Octopuses are gonochoric {{and have}} a single, posteriorly-located gonad which is {{associated}} with the coelom. The testis in males and the ovary in females bulges into the gonocoel and the gametes are released here. The gonocoel is connected by the gonoduct to the mantle cavity, which it enters at the gonopore. An optic gland creates hormones that cause the octopus to mature and age and stimulate gamete production. The gland may be triggered by environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrition, which thus control the timing <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> and lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Termites, {{although}} {{sometimes called}} 'white ants', are not ants. They {{belong to the}} sub-order Isoptera within the order Blattodea. Termites are {{more closely related to}} cockroaches and mantids. Termites are eusocial, but differ greatly in the genetics <b>of</b> <b>reproduction.</b> The similarity of their social structure to that of ants is attributed to convergent evolution. Velvet ants look like large ants, but are wingless female wasps.|$|E
5|$|The dog conch is an {{economically}} important {{species in the}} Indo-West Pacific, and several studies indicate {{that it may be}} suffering population declines due to overfishing and overexploitation. Malacologists and ecologists have recommended a reduction in its exploitation rate; initiatives in Thailand are attempting to ensure the possibility <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> in young-adult individuals and manage the natural populations in general. L.canarium demonstrates the imposex phenomenon, but is resistant to sterility caused by it; therefore, {{it has been suggested that}} this species might be useful as a bioindicator for organotin pollution monitoring near Malaysian ports.|$|E

5|$|The ringed caecilian (Siphonops annulatus) has {{developed}} a unique adaptation for the purposes <b>of</b> <b>reproduction.</b> The progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy. The brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate. Meanwhile, they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca.|$|E
5|$|There is no unique {{generally}} accepted {{system at the}} higher taxonomic levels and there are frequent name changes at every level, from species upwards. Efforts among researchers are now underway to establish and encourage usage of a unified and more consistent nomenclature.

5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are quick}} to bite if touched, captured, or otherwise provoked, and can inflict severe lacerations. Commercial fisheries for this species exist off Baja California {{and to a lesser}} extent off California (see below); the meat is considered excellent and is sold fresh or frozen. This species is captured in limited numbers by recreational fishers using hook-and-line, spears, or even by hand, particularly off southern California. It is also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls operating in the Gulf of California, and processed into fishmeal. The capacity of this species to withstand a focused fishing effort is limited, due to its low rates <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> and movement.|$|E
5|$|Angel sharks {{in general}} are highly {{threatened}} by commercial trawl fisheries due to their susceptibility to capture and low rate <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> and angel shark species elsewhere {{are known to have}} declined markedly under fishing pressure. Trawling activity in the Yellow Sea {{and other parts of the}} northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to 50% or more under these conditions, leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government, though enforcement is inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E

5|$|Anthozoans exhibit {{great powers}} of regeneration; lost parts swiftly regrow {{and the sea}} anemone Aiptasia pallida can be vivisected in the {{laboratory}} {{and then returned to}} the aquarium where it will heal. They are capable of a variety of asexual means <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> including fragmentation, longitudinal and transverse fission and budding. Sea anemones for example can crawl across a surface leaving behind them detached pieces of the pedal disc which develop into new clonal individuals. Anthopleura species divide longitudinally, pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and patterning. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing on the column before the sea anemone tears itself apart. Zoanthids are capable of budding off new individuals.|$|E
5|$|Because the kakapo is long-lived, with {{an average}} life {{expectancy}} of 58years and the maximum at about 90 years, it tends to have an adolescence before it starts breeding. Males start booming at about 5years of age. It was thought that females reached sexual maturity at 9 years of age, but this idea was debunked in the 2008 breeding season when two 6-year-old females named Apirama and Rakiura laid eggs. Generally females do not seek out males until they are between 9 and 11 years old. The kakapo does not breed every year and {{has one of the}} lowest rates <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. Rimu mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests such as those on Codfish Island, kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently.|$|E
5|$|Blacknose sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fishes and cephalopods, {{and in turn}} fall prey to larger sharks. Like other members of their family, they exhibit a viviparous mode <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection. The females give birth to three to six young in late spring or early summer, either annually or biennually, after a gestation period of eight to 11 months. This species is not known to attack humans, though {{it has been documented}} performing a threat display towards divers. It is of moderate commercial and recreational importance. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Near Threatened. In 2009, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the populations of the blacknose shark off the United States are being overfished, and proposed new conservation measures.|$|E

5|$|Breeding {{experiments}} to study evolution and genetics. Laboratory mice, flies, fish, and worms are inbred through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics. These provide animals of a known genetic background, {{an important tool}} for genetic analyses. Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow rate <b>of</b> <b>reproduction,</b> though some scientists take advantage of inbred domesticated animals, such as dog or cattle breeds, for comparative purposes. Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their niche) produce adaptations in their physiology and morphology. As an example, sticklebacks are now being used to study how many and which types of mutations are selected to produce adaptations in animals' morphology during the evolution of new species.|$|E
5|$|Climate can {{influence}} bat distribution, movements and biogeography, access to food resources, timing <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> and emergence {{and rate of}} energy expenditure. In combination with other factors, including ongoing loss and degradation of habitat, global climate change or global warming presents a serious and increasing threat to bats and other fauna. The affinity of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat for riparian zones in arid and semi-arid environments renders it potentially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} water stress and extreme weather events. Ecological factors that qualify the bristle-faced free-tailed bat as being at increased risk of the potential impacts of global climate change include habitat (species that rely on riparian habitats in water stress prone environments), foraging type (aerial hawking insectivore), roost type (tree hollow specialist), biogeography (species with limited dispersal ability, limited ranging behaviour) and extreme weather (species that occur in regions where there is an increasing risk of extreme temperature events or changes in rainfall patterns).|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} options {{available}} for treating sexual dysfunction in men (for whom results are concretely observable), those available for women are limited.

In theory, women's sexual response could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris, but few studies on treatments for sexual function in women with SCI have been carried out. There is a particular paucity of information outside the area <b>of</b> <b>reproduction.</b>|$|E
