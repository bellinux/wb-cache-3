25|$|Speed of {{processing}} is another theory {{that has been}} raised to explain working memory deficits. As a result of various studies he has completed examining this topic, Salthouse argues that as we age our speed {{of processing}} information decreases significantly. It is this decrease in processing speed that is then responsible for <b>our</b> <b>inability</b> to use working memory efficiently as we age. The younger persons brain is able to obtain and process information at a quicker rate which allows for subsequent integration and manipulation needed to complete the cognitive task at hand. As this processing slows, cognitive tasks that rely on quick processing speed then become more difficult.|$|E

50|$|Several {{concerns}} {{are associated with}} tacting private events. Skinner (1957) acknowledged two major dilemmas. First, he acknowledges our difficulty with predicting and controlling the stimuli associated with tacting private events (p. 130). Catania (2007) describes this as the unavailability of the stimulus {{to the members of}} the verbal community (p. 253). The second problem Skinner (1957) describes is <b>our</b> current <b>inability</b> to understand how the verbal behavior associated with private events is developed (p. 131).|$|R
2500|$|Some (including Albert Einstein) {{argue that}} <b>our</b> <b>inability</b> to predict {{any more than}} probabilities is simply due to ignorance. The idea is that, beyond the {{conditions}} and laws we can observe or deduce, there are also hidden factors or [...] "hidden variables" [...] that determine absolutely in which order photons reach the detector screen. They argue that {{the course of the}} universe is absolutely determined, but that humans are screened from knowledge of the determinative factors. So, they say, it only appears that things proceed in a merely probabilistically determinative way. In actuality, they proceed in an absolutely deterministic way.|$|E
2500|$|Although Thoreau {{believed}} {{resistance to}} unjustly exercised authority could be both violent (exemplified in {{his support for}} John Brown) and nonviolent (his own example of tax resistance displayed in Resistance to Civil Government), he regarded pacifist nonresistance as temptation to passivity, writing: “Let not our Peace be proclaimed by the rust on our swords, or <b>our</b> <b>inability</b> to draw them from their scabbards; but let her at least have so much work on her hands as to keep those swords bright and sharp.” [...] Furthermore, in a formal lyceum debate in 1841, he debated the subject “Is it ever proper to offer forcible resistance?”, arguing the affirmative.|$|E

2500|$|In 1885, Gordon {{achieved}} the martyrdom {{he had been}} seeking at Khartoum as the British press portrayed him as a saintly Christian hero and martyr who had died nobly resisting the Islamic onslaught of the Mahdi. As late as 1901 {{on the anniversary of}} Gordon's death, The Times wrote in a leader (editorial) that Gordon was [...] "that solitary figure holding aloft the flag of England {{in the face of the}} dark hordes of Islam". Gordon's death caused a huge wave of national grief all over Britain with 13 March 1885 being set aside as a day of mourning for the [...] "fallen hero of Khartoum". In a sermon, the Bishop of Chichester stated: [...] "Nations who envied our greatness rejoiced now at our weakness and <b>our</b> <b>inability</b> to protect our trusted servant. Scorn and reproach were cast upon us, and would we plead that it was undeserved? No; the conscience of the nation felt that a strain rested upon it". Baring [...] who deeply disliked Gordon [...] wrote that because of the [...] "national hysteria" [...] caused by Gordon's death, that saying anything critical about him at present would be equal to questioning Christianity. Stones were thrown at the windows at 10 Downing Street as Gladstone was denounced as the [...] "Murderer of Gordon", the Judas figure who betrayed the Christ figure Gordon. The wave of mourning was not just confined to Britain. In New York, Paris and Berlin, pictures of Gordon appeared in shop windows with black lining as all over the West the fallen general was seen as a Christ-like man who sacrificed himself resisting the advance of Islam.|$|E

40|$|Acculturation {{refers to}} the {{processes}} by which individuals, families, communities, and societies react to inter-cultural contact. Advances in communication and transportation technologies, and increasing migration pressures due to demographic, economic, environmental, human rights, and security disparities, make acculturation {{one of the most}} important topics for applied research in cross-cultural psychology. However, progress in acculturation research has been frustrated by <b>our</b> <b>inabilities</b> to pit theories against each other in meaningful ways, to summarize results by meta-analytic methods, or to improve constructs and scales all because we have been unaware of the interdisciplinary breadth of acculturation research and its historical depth. This annotated bibliography of acculturation taxonomies presents an accessible historical foundation to the literature on acculturation. The most ancient psychological discussion of acculturation appears to be that of Plato in 348 BC. In the early 19 th century, DeTocqueville speculated about acculturation processes in Europe and America. The word "acculturation " was first used in 1880, and by 1900 scholars were already writing histories of acculturation theory. G. Stanley Hall was the first psychologist to write about acculturation, and Thomas and Znaniecki presented the first full psychological theory in 1918. Since then, more than 100 different taxonomies of acculturation have been published, most of them cited and summarized here...|$|R

Further, these accomodation times don’t include movements if the displays are “visually field discontiguous” [81].|$|R
