5|$|Upon its {{inception}} in 1921, a very different M-86 was routed along a portion of present-day M-66 from M-46 at Six Lakes northward to Remus, ending at M-24 (modern M-20). A few years later in 1924–25, M-66 was extended north to Remus, supplanting the contemporary M-86. At the same time, the M-86 designation was relocated to Ionia County to run from M-44 in <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> M-43 (present day M-66) just east of there. In late 1929, M-44 was extended east from <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> junction with M-43, once again, causing M-86 to be supplanted and removed from the highway system.|$|E

5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|Charles trusted Isabeau {{enough by}} 1402 {{to allow her}} to {{arbitrate}} the growing dispute between the Orléanists and Burgundians, and he turned control of the treasury over to her. After Philip the Bold died in 1404 and his son John the Fearless became Duke of Burgundy, the new duke continued the political strife in an attempt {{to gain access to the}} royal treasury for Burgundian interests. Orléans and the royal dukes thought John was usurping power for his own interests and Isabeau, at that time, aligned herself with <b>Orléans</b> <b>to</b> protect the interests of the crown and her children. Furthermore, she distrusted John the Fearless who she thought overstepped himself in rank—he was cousin to the King whereas Orléans was Charles' brother.|$|E

5|$|His {{funeral was}} {{one of the largest in}} the South. Davis was first entombed at the Army of Northern Virginia tomb at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans. In 1893, Mrs. Davis decided to have his remains reinterred at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. After the remains were exhumed in New Orleans, they lay for a day at Memorial Hall of the newly {{organized}} Louisiana Historical Association, with many mourners passing by the casket, including Governor Murphy J. Foster, Sr. The body was placed on a Louisville and Nashville Railroad car and transported to Richmond, Virginia. A continuous cortège, day and night, accompanied his body from New <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> Richmond. He is interred at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.|$|E
5|$|In 1525 or 1526, Gérard {{withdrew his}} son from the Collège de Montaigu and {{enrolled}} {{him in the}} University of <b>Orléans</b> <b>to</b> study law. According to contemporary biographers Theodore Beza and Nicolas Colladon, Gérard believed that Calvin would earn more money as a lawyer than as a priest. After {{a few years of}} quiet study, Calvin entered the University of Bourges in 1529. He was intrigued by Andreas Alciati, a humanist lawyer. Humanism was a European intellectual movement which stressed classical studies. During his 18-month stay in Bourges, Calvin learned Koine Greek, a necessity for studying the New Testament.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, {{the state}} began {{construction}} on the Wabash and Erie Canal. The canal was started at Lake Erie, passed through Fort Wayne, and connected to the Wabash River. This new canal made water transport possible from New <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> Lake Erie on an internal route rather than sailing around {{the whole of the}} Eastern United States and entering through Canada. Other canal projects were started, but all were abandoned before completion due to the state's foundering credit after the devaluation of the bonds.|$|E

5|$|In December 1862, Nathaniel P. Banks {{replaced}} Butler {{in command}} at New Orleans. Banks, a Massachusetts Republican with prohibitionist sympathies, had known Dow before the war, but he initially displeased Dow {{by refusing to}} repeal Butler's order against confiscation of rebel property. He did, however, allow Dow to return to New <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> {{take part in the}} planned spring offensive. As the Union armies looked to complete their control over the Mississippi River, only Vicksburg, Mississippi and Port Hudson, Louisiana held out against federal control. Major General Ulysses S. Grant moved on Vicksburg from the north while Banks advanced to Port Hudson from the south. By May 21, the town was surrounded.|$|E
5|$|In late 1835, Davis sailed from New <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> Havana, Cuba, to {{help restore}} his health. He was {{accompanied}} by James Pemberton, his only slave at that time. Davis observed the Spanish military and sketched fortifications. Although no evidence points to his having any motive beyond general interest, the authorities knew that Davis was a former army officer and warned him to stop his observations. Bored and feeling somewhat better, Davis booked passage on a ship to New York, then continued to Washington, D.C., where he visited his old schoolmate George Wallace Jones. He soon returned with Pemberton to Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} in New Orleans, Louisiana, was delayed following Hurricane Katrina {{because of the}} devastation caused by the storm {{and the collapse of}} the levees. Many of the exteriors were set to be shot in New Orleans, including a key sequence involving the Canal Street Ferry across the Mississippi River. After the city was reopened, the cast and crew returned to New <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> continue filming. Some scenes of the post-Katrina devastation were worked into the plot, including those in the Lower 9th Ward; additionally, evidence of Katrina's impact on the city was worked into the script.Deja Vu starts production in New Orleans|work= USA Today|date= February 2, 2006|accessdate=2008-10-19|quote= |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-02-02-deja-vu_x.htm}} The filming crew spent two weeks filming a scene at the Four Mile Bayou in Morgan City, Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|Task Force Katrina Commander Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore {{also charged}} the paratroopers to {{straighten}} out the evacuation situations at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, the New Orleans Convention Center and the Superdome. In all, 3,600 of the division's paratroopers were deployed to New <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> participate in Task Force All-American. The unit worked in tandem with state, local and other federal authorities to feed, process and transport evacuees to other accommodations; the division's soldiers helped evacuate 6,000 New Orleans residents. By September 18, the 82nd Division medical personnel had treated 1,352people and given 2,047 immunizations, according to unit documents. By September 19, 82nd Division military engineers had cleared 185 city blocks of debris, cleared 113 streets, and removed 218 trees, according to unit documents.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{had a major}} {{effect on}} the {{development}} of Indiana. Before the war, the population was generally in the south of the state, where many had entered via the Ohio River, which provided a cheap and convenient means to export products and agriculture to New <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> be sold. The war closed the Mississippi River to traffic for nearly four years, forcing Indiana to find other means to export its produce. This led to a population shift to the north where the state came to rely more on the Great Lakes and the railroad for exports.|$|E
5|$|The year 1955 saw further {{changes to}} the {{division}} and more changes of assignment for subordinate elements.

On 30 January, the 377th Regiment was reassigned to the 95th from the 75th and its headquarters moved from New <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> Tulsa, Oklahoma.

5|$|Tightrope (1984) had Eastwood {{starring}} opposite Geneviève Bujold in {{a provocative}} thriller, inspired by newspaper articles about an elusive Bay Area rapist. Set in New <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> avoid confusion with the Dirty Harry films, Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his target's tortured psychology and fascination for sadomasochism. Tightrope {{was a critical}} and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing R-rated film of 1984. Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy City Heat (1984) alongside Burt Reynolds, a film about a private eye and his partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the prohibition era of the 1930s. The film grossed around $50million domestically, but was overshadowed by Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop.|$|E
5|$|William Legrand has {{relocated}} from New <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> Sullivan's Island in South Carolina {{after losing}} his family fortune, and has brought his African-American servant Jupiter with him. The story's narrator, {{a friend of}} Legrand, visits him one evening to see an unusual scarab-like bug he has found. The bug's weight and lustrous appearance convince Jupiter that it is made of pure gold. Legrand has lent it to an officer stationed at a nearby fort, but he draws a sketch of it for the narrator, with markings on the carapace that resemble a skull. As they discuss the bug, Legrand becomes particularly focused on the sketch and carefully locks it in his desk for safekeeping. Confused, the narrator takes his leave for the night.|$|E
5|$|Arkansas {{participated in}} the Yorktown Sesquicentennial {{celebrations}} in October 1931, marking the 150th anniversary of the Siege of Yorktown.

She then went into drydock for an extensive refit in the Philadelphia Navy Yard, which lasted until January 1932. During this time, she was under the command of George Landenberger. Arkansas was transferred to the Pacific Fleet after completing the refit; while en route, she stopped in New <b>Orleans</b> <b>to</b> participate in the Mardi Gras celebration. She operated off the west coast through early 1934, at which point she was transferred back to the Atlantic Fleet, where she served as the flagship of the Training Squadron.|$|E
