50|$|The Federal Wire Securities Service {{provides}} safekeeping, transfer, {{and settlement}} services for securities {{issued by the}} United States Treasury, federal agencies, government-sponsored enterprises, and certain international transactions. Securities are kept {{in the form of}} electronic records of securities held in <b>custody</b> <b>accounts.</b> Securities are transferred according to instructions provided by parties with access to the system. Access to the Federal Wire Securities Service is limited to depository institutions that maintain accounts with a Reserve Bank, as well as some government offices. Other parties, such as brokers and dealers, must hold and transfer securities through depository institutions that are both Federal Wire participants and that provide specialized government securities clearing services. In 2013, the Federal Wire Securities Service processed 20.4 million of these securities transfers with a value of $267.6 trillion.|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of the Slovenian central bank, the Bank of Slovenia (BS), adjustment policy to surges in capital flows has shown that BS was quite successful in its attempts to mitigate detrimental effects of capital flows on national economy. As such an increased flows through capital account did not cause the excessive money supply. The latter meets money demand and current account most of the time. On the other side, analysis indicates that the BS was not so successful in preventing real appreciation of exchange rate, deriving from excessive foreign currency inflow, which had a rather strong significance {{as one of the}} foreign exchange determinants with negative influence on its growth (depreciation). In addition to indirect adjustment methods the so-called direct methods of adjustment to surges in capital flows were also used.

50|$|An LGD model {{assesses the}} value and/or {{the quality of}} a {{security}} the bank holds for providing the loan - securities can be either machinery like cars, trucks or construction machines. It can be mortgages or it can be a <b>custody</b> <b>account</b> or a commodity. The higher the value of the security the lower the LGD and thus the potential loss the bank or insurance faces {{in the case of a}} default. Banks using the A-IRB approach have to determine LGD values, whereas banks within the F-IRB do only have to do so for the retail-portfolio. For example, as of 2013, there were nine companies in the United Kingdom with their own mortgage LGD models. In Switzerland there were two banks as of 2013. In Germany many thrifts - especially the market leader Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall - have their own mortgage LGD models. In the corporate asset class many German banks still only use the values given by the regulator under the F-IRB approach.|$|R

40|$|Securities {{settlement}} is an area, where {{nobody seems to}} be content with the current international processing systems, but neither has a proposal for improvement emerged that has attracted common support. This paper describes a possible solution based on an international, harmonised and simplified institutional structure operating in an open real-time network structure. All deals are settled in immediate, t+ 0, real-time, which means that all assets and funds are delivered immediately and thereby removing settlement risk. Inter-custodian delivery problems of securities will disappear, because only securities available on investors’ accounts can be settled, which continuously equals the amount on the omnibus-accounts. This will also take out the risks related to ‘naked’ short selling, because in most cases investors have to make securities and funds available before trading. This may divide the current market in a spot t+ 0 and a short term t+ 3 futures’ market. Corporate actions can be organised in coordination and executed in synchronisation through the infrastructure network in which all custodians and registrars/CSDs participate. The paper describes the concrete new methods required (eg international <b>custody</b> <b>account</b> number system, ICAN, and DVP-codes for matching) also the probable impact of immediate real-time settlement on trading patterns, liquidity issues and risk containment. These are all areas, where the proposed new infrastructural solutions would bring benefits to the users, mainly faster/immediate delivery, less risks, lower processing costs, more competition and more efficient processing of corporate actions. Custodians’ liquidity management will {{need to focus on}} the sufficiency of the real-time balance of settlement money, which might be more or less strained compared to the current situation depending on the off- setting patterns of incoming and outgoing settlements during the day. International implementation will require coordination and engagement by key players. Securities settlement, securities settlement infrastructure, DVP processing, securities trading interfaces...|$|R

5000|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of a tri-party repo {{is that a}} custodian bank or international clearing organization, the tri-party agent, acts as an intermediary {{between the two parties}} to the repo. The tri-party agent is responsible for the administration of the transaction including collateral allocation, marking to market, and substitution of collateral. In the US, the two principal tri-party agents are The Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan Chase, whilst in Europe the principal tri-party agents are Euroclear and Clearstream with SIX offering services in the Swiss market. The size of the US tri-party repo market peaked in 2008 before the worst effects of the crisis at approximately $2.8 trillion and by mid-2010 was about $1.6 trillion.As tri-party agents administer the equivalent of hundreds of billions of USD of global collateral, they have the scale to subscribe to multiple data feeds to maximise the universe of coverage. As part of a tri-party agreement the three parties to the agreement, the tri-party agent, the repo buyer (the Collateral Taker/Cash Provider, [...] "CAP") and the repo seller (Cash Borrower/Collateral Provider, [...] "COP") agree to a collateral management service agreement which includes an [...] "eligible collateral profile". It is this [...] "eligible collateral profile" [...] that enables the repo buyer to define their risk appetite in respect of the collateral that they are prepared to hold against their cash. For example, a more risk averse repo buyer may wish to only hold [...] "on-the-run" [...] government bonds as collateral. In the event of a liquidation event of the repo seller the collateral is highly liquid thus enabling the repo buyer to sell the collateral quickly. A less risk averse repo buyer may be prepared to take non investment grade bonds or equities as collateral, which may be less liquid and may suffer a higher price volatility {{in the event of a}} repo seller default, making it more difficult for the repo buyer to sell the collateral and recover their cash. The tri-party agents are able to offer sophisticated collateral eligibility filters which allow the repo buyer to create these [...] "eligible collateral profiles" [...] which can systemically generate collateral pools which reflect the buyers risk appetite. Collateral eligibility criteria could include asset type, issuer, currency, domicile, credit rating, maturity, index, issue size, average daily traded volume, etc. Both the lender (repo buyer) and borrower (repo seller) of cash enter into these transactions to avoid the administrative burden of bi-lateral repos. In addition, because the collateral is being held by an agent, counterparty risk is reduced. A tri-party repo may be seen as the outgrowth of the due bill repo. A due bill repo is a repo in which the collateral is retained by the Cash borrower and not delivered to the cash provider. There is an increased element of risk when compared to the tri-party repo as collateral on a due bill repo is held within a client <b>custody</b> <b>account</b> at the Cash Borrower rather than a collateral account at a neutral third party.|$|R
50|$|Viên {{refused to}} {{participate}} in the 1963 coup against South Vietnamese President Ngô Đình Diệm. He was one of several military leaders who were unaware of the coup. When called to a lunchtime meeting with other senior officers and informed of the coup d'état, he reportedly broke down in tears and resigned, refusing {{to go along with the}} putsch. Vien was not aware of the plot, and the generals had discussed whether to assassinate him during their planning phase because they knew he was a Diem admirer. His loyalty to the conspirators now suspect, a rifle was thrust into his back and he was moments from being killed. But Major General Tôn Thất Đính had spoken with General Dương Văn Minh during the planning for the coup and convinced Minh to save Viên's life. Dinh played mahjong with Vien's wife, and had convinced Minh that Vien would not oppose the coup. Vien had planned with Diem to allow the president to take refuge at his home in the event of a coup, but the offer could not be taken up because the rebels surrounded Vien's house after taking him into <b>custody.</b> Another <b>account</b> has him accepting the coup after being informed of it.

40|$|Abstract—A digital {{chain of}} <b>custody</b> is an <b>account</b> documenting digital data at a {{particular}} place and time. This paper gives a method of validating and authenticating a digital chain of custody using an algorithm by Jakobsson and by providing a new algorithm that compliments Jakobsson’s algorithm. Our method assumes specialized hardware. The physical hardware {{is assumed to be}} memory and processor constrained. Our new algorithm is an online algorithm that generates a hash chain of n hash elements without knowledge of n before it starts. At the same time, as n grows our new algorithm stores only the dlog ne pebbles which are inputs for Jakobsson’s amortized hash chain traversal algorithm. Jakobsson’s algorithm is then used to validate hash elements and thus the digital chain of custody. The complimentary algorithm presented here is used to generate and store the hash chain. The compact representation used by these algorithms is useful to store a large digital chain of custody on a small and constrained device. Our proposed method allows the use of constrained devices to validate complex and ephemeral data such as shipping manifests and handling logs. I...|$|R

Nick can see immediately {{that he is}} not Davies' father because Davies looks just like Angus. Hoping to find out why Morn survived the force-growth, the aliens run a scan which reveals her zone implant. Angry and betrayed, Nick wants revenge against Morn and her son. An opportunity arises when the Amnion demand that he sell Davies back to them. He gets his opportunity when the aliens demand they return Davies into their <b>custody,</b> but doesn't <b>account</b> for the extreme lengths to which Morn will go to protect her son. While Nick negotiates with the Amnion to trade Davies for engine parts, Morn escapes from a locked room and rigs a self-destruct large enough to destroy the ship itself and most of Enablement Station. Morn is successfully able to threaten both sides. She orders Nick to keep Davies on the ship rather than sell him to the Amnion, then forces the aliens to give them the engine parts anyway. When the Amnion hold Nick accountable for Morn's actions and declare him an enemy, he flees from their warship back toward human space. The alien ships pursue him across the border, breaking the treaties that had until then prevented outright war between the Amnion and the UMCP.|$|R
40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) The Global Transactions Services (GTS) {{business}} unit was established alongside the Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) brand reporting into a Corporate and Investment Banking Board. GTS has been mandated to deliver global cash management, trade and <b>custody</b> services and <b>account</b> services to large corporates in the jurisdictions where FirstRand operates. Technology advances in centralising operating structures, {{have made it}} possible for GTS to centralise back office operations to a few locations within the country as witnessed by Global banks like Citigroup. The research problem therefore was to evaluate and identify the strengths as well as shortfalls of the current decentralised operating model versus a proposed approach towards a centralised operating model within the GTS {{business unit}}; focusing on investigating whether outsourcing IT operations and technology would create efficiencies, attract skilled employees and technological advancement to the division. Primary objective of the research was to evaluate the current decentralised operating model. Secondary objective was to evaluate the gains associated with implementing a central operating model against the gains currently derived from the decentralised operating model. The findings derived from the study suggest that: (i) There is a misalignment between the business strategy and IT strategy within the current operating model resulting in IT playing a supporting role and not an enabling role in the business strategy formulation and implementation. (ii) The bank does not engage in an on-going activity to evaluate processes, procedures and technology making it difficult to streamline and automate processes resulting in a lot of manual processing. (iii) The bank lacks the internal capabilities required to introduce automated processes which will reduce manual interventions; (iv) Existence of Silos in the business prevent the business from taking advantage of benefits brought about by economies of scale, cross skilling, knowledge sharing, straight through processing and ultimately economies of scope benefit...|$|R
