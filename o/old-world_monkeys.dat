50|$|The rate of {{adaptive}} {{evolution in the}} human genome has often assumed to be constant over time. For example, the 35% estimate for α calculated by Fay et al. (2001) led them to conclude that there was one adaptive substitution in the human lineage every 200 years since human divergence from <b>old-world</b> <b>monkeys.</b> However, even if the original value of α is accurate for a particular time period, this extrapolation is still invalid. This is {{because there has been}} a large acceleration in the amount of positive selection in the human lineage over the last 40,000 years, {{in terms of the number}} of genes that have undergone adaptive evolution (Hawks et al. 2007). This agrees with simple theoretical predictions, because the human population size has expanded massively in the last 40,000 years, and with more people, there should be more adaptive substitutions. Hawks et al. (2007) argue that demographic changes (particularly population expansion) may greatly facilitate adaptive evolution, an argument that corroborates somewhat with the positive correlation inferred between population size and amount {{of adaptive}} evolution occurring mentioned previously.It has been suggested that cultural evolution may have replaced genetic evolution, and hence slowed the rate of adaptive evolution over the past 10,000 years. However, it is possible that cultural evolution could actually increase genetic adaption. Cultural evolution has vastly increased communication and contact between different populations, and this provides much greater opportunities for genetic admixture between the different populations (Hawks et al. 2007). However, recent cultural phenomena, such as modern medicine and the smaller variation in modern family sizes, may reduce genetic adaption as natural selection is relaxed, overriding the increased potential for adaptation due to greater genetic admixture.|$|E

Our examination focuses particularly on individual neurons: what are their visual properties, how might these properties arise, what do these prop-erties tell us about visual signal transformations, and how might these properties be expressed in perception?

60|$|As if to demonstrate, by a {{striking}} example, {{the impossibility of}} erecting any cerebral barrier between man and the apes, Nature has provided us, in the latter animals, with an almost complete series of gradations from brains little {{higher than that of}} a Rodent, to brains little lower than that of Man. And it is a remarkable circumstance that though, so far as our present knowledge extends, there 'is' one true structural break in the series of forms of Simian brains, this hiatus does not lie between Man and the man-like apes, but between the lower and the lowest Simians; or, in other words, between the old and new world apes and monkeys, and the Lemurs. Every Lemur which has yet been examined, in fact, has its cerebellum partially visible from above, and its posterior lobe, with the contained posterior cornu and hippocampus minor, more or less rudimentary. Every Marmoset, American <b>monkey,</b> <b>old-world</b> <b>monkey,</b> Baboon, or Man-like ape, on the contrary, has its cerebellum entirely hidden, posteriorly, by the cerebral lobes, and possesses a large posterior cornu, with a well-developed hippocampus minor.|$|R
40|$|Executive control {{functions}} (ECFs) {{have become}} an important topic in the cognitive sciences in the past 40 years. The number of publications has steadily increased, {{and in the last}} decade, studies have been conducted in one of the best models of human cognition: the <b>old-world</b> macaque <b>monkey.</b> Here, we review recent studies in the monkey that have contributed {{to our understanding of the}} neuronal implementation of ECFs, with a focus on task-switching paradigms. These paradigms have revealed that ECFs are distributed across both the parietal and frontal lobes...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that damage to the {{peripheral}} auditory system causes deficits in tone detection as well as pitch and loudness perception across a wide range of frequencies. However, the extent to which to which the auditory cortex plays a critical role in these basic aspects of spectral processing, especially with regard to speech, music, and environmental sound perception, remains unclear. Recent experiments indicate that primary auditory cortex is necessary for the normally-high perceptual acuity exhibited by humans in pure-tone frequency discrimination. The present study assessed whether the auditory cortex plays a similar role in the intensity domain and contrasted its contribution to sensory versus discriminative aspects of intensity processing. We measured intensity thresholds for pure-tone detection and pure-tone loudness discrimination in a population of healthy adults and a middle-aged man with complete or near-complete lesions of the auditory cortex bilaterally. Detection thresholds in his left and right ears were 16 and 7 dB HL, respectively, within clinically-defined normal limits. In contrast, the intensity threshold for monaural loudness discrimination at 1 kHz was 6. 5 ± 2. 1 dB in the left ear and 6. 5 ± 1. 9 dB in the right ear at 40 dB sensation level, well above the means of the control population (left ear: 1. 6 ± 0. 22 dB; right ear: 1. 7 ± 0. 19 dB). The results indicate that auditory cortex lowers just-noticeable differences for loudness discrimination by approximately 5 dB but is not necessary for tone detection in quiet. Previous human and <b>Old-world</b> <b>monkey</b> experiments employing lesion-effect, neurophysiology, and neuroimaging methods to investigate the role of auditory cortex in intensity processing are reviewed.

40|$|First paragraph: Women {{lack the}} {{conspicuous}} morphological and behavioral changes {{related to their}} menstrual cycle that are seen during estrus in some <b>old-world</b> <b>monkeys,</b> such as baboons, or in some apes, such as chimpanzees. In these species, changes in morphology and behavior — including genital swelling and active sexual solicitation — tend to peak in the fertile phase of the cycle and elicit elevated interest and sexual activity in their male conspecifics. Although {{they are not as}} conspicuous, some cyclic fluctuations in physical appearance and behavior can nonetheless be observed in women...|$|E
40|$|Social chemosignals, {{so-called}} pheromones, {{have recently}} {{attracted much attention}} in that effects on women's psychophysiology and cortical processing have been reported. We here tested {{the hypothesis that the}} human brain would process a putative social chemosignal, the endogenous steroid endrostadienone, faster than other odorants with perceptually matched intensity and hedonic characteristics. Chemosensory event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded in healthy women. ERP analyses indicate that androstadienone was processed significantly faster than the control odorants. Androstadienone elicited shorter latencies for all recorded ERP components but most so for the late positivity. This finding indicates that androstadienone is processed differently than other related odorants, suggesting the possibility of a specific neuronal subsystem to the main olfactory pathway akin to the one previously reported in <b>Old-world</b> <b>monkeys</b> and emotional visual stimuli in humans...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Hepcidin/LEAP- 1 is an iron {{regulatory}} hormone originally {{identified as}} an antimicrobial peptide. As part of a systematic analysis {{of the evolution of}} host defense peptides in primates, we have sequenced the orthologous gene from 14 species of non-human primates. Results The sequence of the mature peptide is highly conserved amongst all the analyzed species, being identical to the human one in great apes and gibbons, with a single residue conservative variation in <b>Old-World</b> <b>monkeys</b> and with few substitutions in New-World monkeys. Conclusion Our analysis indicates that hepcidin's role as a regulatory hormone, which involves interaction with a conserved receptor (ferroportin), may result in conservation over most of its sequence, {{with the exception of the}} stretch between residues 15 and 18, which in New-World monkeys (as well as in other mammals) shows a significant variation, possibly indicating that this structural region is involved in other functions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Otoacoustic {{estimates}} of cochlear frequency selectivity suggest substantially sharper tuning in humans. However, the logic and methodology underlying these estimates remain untested by direct measurements in primates. We report measurements of frequency tuning in macaque <b>monkeys,</b> <b>Old-World</b> primates phylogenetically closer to humans than the small laboratory animals often taken as models of human hearing (e. g., cats, guinea pigs, and chinchillas). We find that measurements of tuning obtained directly from individual nerve fibers and indirectly using otoacoustic emissions both indicate that peripheral frequency selectivity in macaques is significantly sharper than in small laboratory animals, matching that inferred for humans at high frequencies. Our results validate {{the use of}} otoacoustic emissions for noninvasive measurement of cochlear tuning and corroborate the finding of sharper tuning in humans. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Frequency {{selectivity}} in {{the inner}} ear is fundamental to hearing and is traditionally thought to be similar across mammals. Although direct measurements are not possible in humans, estimates of frequency tuning based on noninvasive recordings of sound evoked from the cochlea (otoacoustic emissions) have suggested substantially sharper tuning in humans but remain controversial. We report measurements of frequency tuning in macaque <b>monkeys,</b> <b>Old-World</b> primates phylogenetically closer to humans than the laboratory animals often taken as models of human hearing (e. g., cats, guinea pigs, chinchillas). We find that measurements of tuning obtained directly from individual auditory-nerve fibers and indirectly using otoacoustic emissions both indicate that at characteristic frequencies above about 500 Hz, peripheral frequency selectivity in macaques is significantly sharper than in these common laboratory animals, matching that inferred for humans above 4 - 5 kHz. Compared with the macaque, the human otoacoustic estimates thus appear neither prohibitively sharp nor exceptional. Our results validate the use of otoacoustic emissions for noninvasive measurement of cochlear tuning and corroborate the finding of sharp tuning in humans. The results {{have important implications for}} understanding the mechanical and neural coding of sound in the human cochlea, and thus for developing strategies to compensate for the degradation of tuning in the hearing-impaired. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{brains of}} humans and <b>old-world</b> <b>monkeys</b> show {{a great deal of}} {{anatomical}} similarity. The auditory cortical system, for instance, is organized into a ventral and a dorsal pathway in both species. A fundamental question with regard to the evolution of speech and language (as well as music) is whether human and monkey brains show principal differences in their organization (e. g. new pathways appearing {{as a result of a}} single mutation), or whether species differences are of a more subtle, quantitative nature. There is little doubt about a similar role of the ventral auditory pathway in both humans and monkeys in the decoding of spectrally complex sounds, which some authors have referred to as auditory object recognition. This includes the decoding of speech sounds (speech perception) and their ultimate linking to meaning in humans. The originally presumed role of the auditory dorsal pathway in spatial processing, by analogy to the visual dorsal pathway, has recently been conceptualized into a more general role in sensorimotor integration and control. Specifically for speech, the dorsal processing stream plays a role in speech production as well as categorization of phonemes during on-line processing of speech...|$|E
40|$|The {{nuclear and}} {{mitochondrial}} genomes coevolve to optimize approximately 100 different interactions necessary for an efficient ATP-generating system. This coevolution {{led to a}} species-specific compatibility between these genomes. We introduced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from different primates into mtDNA-less human cells and selected for growth of cells with a functional oxidative phosphorylation system. mtDNA from common chimpanzee, pigmy chimpanzee, and gorilla were able to restore oxidative phosphorylation {{in the context of}} a human nuclear background, whereas mtDNA from orangutan, and species representative of <b>Old-World</b> <b>monkeys,</b> New-World monkeys, and lemurs were not. Oxygen consumption, a sensitive index of respiratory function, showed that mtDNA from chimpanzee, pigmy chimpanzee, and gorilla replaced the human mtDNA and restored respiration to essentially normal levels. Mitochondrial protein synthesis was also unaltered in successful “xenomitochondrial cybrids. ” The abrupt failure of mtDNA from primate species that diverged from humans as recently as 8 – 18 million years ago to functionally replace human mtDNA suggests the presence of one or a few mutations affecting critical nuclear–mitochondrial genome interactions between these species. These cellular systems provide a demonstration of intergenus mtDNA transfer, expand more than 20 -fold the number of mtDNA polymorphisms that can be analyzed in a human nuclear background, and provide a novel model for the study of nuclear–mitochondrial interactions...|$|E
40|$|In Experiment 1, two {{human populations}} (Westerners and Himba) and <b>old-world</b> <b>monkeys</b> (baboons: Papio papio) were given matching-to-sample colour tasks. We report a similar strong {{tendency}} {{to divide the}} range of coloured stimuli into two equal groups in Westerners and in the remote population (Himba), but not in baboons. When matching the range of colours to the two samples, both human groups produced a boundary at {{the midpoint of the}} range and it was at this point where there was most uncertainty of the best match. The boundary depended on the range of stimuli and hence overrode established colour categories. However, range differences did not affect the names given to the colours by either Western or Himba observers. In Experiment 2, we showed that a distinctive stimulus (focal colour) in the range affected the equal division though observers again made a boundary. Experiment 3 employed an implicit task (visual search) to assess colour categorization (Categorical Perception), and it was only in this task that categorization was immune to range effects and observed only at the established colour boundary. Nevertheless, prior exposure to the range of colours did affect naming producing binary division for a restricted range of colours. Thus, irrespective of whether colour categories are taken to be universal (Berlin & Kay, 1969) or language induced (Davidoff, Davies & Roberson, 1999), they are overridden in colour decision tasks by this stronger human tendency to divide continua into two. It is argued that binary division is the basic human mechanism whereby labels are used to establish colour categories...|$|E
