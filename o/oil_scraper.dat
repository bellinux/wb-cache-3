5000|$|Another engine, {{supposedly}} {{based upon}} the Cosworth BDA and YB series engines, weighed 168 lb, half the weight of its metal counterpart. [...] Plastic parts included the engine block, cam cover, air intake trumpets, intake valve stems, piston skirts and wrist pins, connecting rods, <b>oil</b> <b>scraper</b> piston rings, tappets, valve spring retainers and timing gears.|$|E
50|$|Gas sealing is {{achieved}} {{by the use of}} piston rings. These are a number of narrow iron rings, fitted loosely into grooves in the piston, just below the crown. The rings are split at a point in the rim, allowing them to press against the cylinder with a light spring pressure. Two types of ring are used: the upper rings have solid faces and provide gas sealing; lower rings have narrow edges and a U-shaped profile, to act as <b>oil</b> <b>scrapers.</b> There are many proprietary and detail design features associated with piston rings.|$|R
30|$|The most straightforward, antique {{and widely}} used {{technique}} for solving wax problems inside wells is mechanical removal (Irwin 1955). It {{is common to}} let the paraffin accumulate inside the flowing wells, until a certain amount, and then remove it using mechanical devices. In <b>oil</b> wells, usually, <b>scrapers</b> and cutters are used to remove paraffinic deposits (Al-Yaari and Fahd 2011). There are generally two types of tools: one that cuts the deposit from the tubing and allow the producing oil {{to bring it to}} the surface, and another one that scraps and removes the deposit from the tubing. FigureÂ  6 shows an example of a schematic wax cutter used to cut deposits from the casing (left) and from the tubing (right), without interfering with the production.|$|R

5000|$|Pistons {{are made}} of forged {{aluminum}}. They have three rings and aluminum buttons retain the 1.156 x 3.300 in steel wrist pin. The piston is anodized and Teflon coated to prevent galling during the high thrust load operation encounterd. The top ring is an L-shaped section [...] "Dykes" [...] ring that provides a good seal during combustion but a second ring must be used to prevent excessive oil from entering the combustion chamber during intake strokes as the Dykes-style ring offers less than optimal reverse gas/oil sealing. The third ring is an <b>oil</b> <b>scraper</b> ring whose function is to scrape {{the majority of the}} oil film off of the cylinder wall as the piston descends, to prevent oil being exposed to combustion heat and contaminating the upcoming round of fuel/air. This [...] "oil scraping" [...] also provides a key heat removal step for the cylinder walls and piston skirts, the oil film is renewed as the piston moves upward after BDC.|$|E
50|$|A {{year before}} the {{introduction}} of the MAE, the single overhead cam two valve SCA was introduced. It was a 997 cc engine based on Ford Cortina 116E block that was designed for Formula 2, and featured the first totally Cosworth-designed head, Laystall forged crankshaft, steel main bearing caps and pistons with only one compression ring and one <b>oil</b> <b>scraper</b> ring each. Cylinder head to block sealing was by a head gasket incorporating Cooper Rings. The basic configuration was quite similar to Coventry Climax FWE on Lotus Elite including its SOHC reverse-flow design, except for a series of 7 spur gears (1 on crank, 2 intermediary gears on 2 fixed shafts mounted on the front cover back plate, 1 on the 116E camshaft used as a jackshaft, 2 on a common fixed shaft in the head, 1 on the camshaft) driving a 5 bearing camshaft and the Ford 5 main bearing iron block. The intake ports and the oil scavenge pickup for dry sump lubrication were canted 25 degrees, so they faced straight up and down, respectively, when the engine is mounted 25 degrees from vertical to the right for a lower center of gravity.|$|E
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} {{to determine whether or}} not a properly located and properly designed <b>oil</b> <b>scraper</b> piston ring, installed on a piston provided with oil drain holes of sufficient area, would prevent the excessive oiling of the Liberty engine, particularly with the engine running at idling speed with full oil pressure. Results showed that excessive oiling was in fact prevented. It is strongly recommended that scraper rings and pistons be adopted for aircraft engines...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} assessment of some advanced Stirling engine component concepts are presented. High performance piston rings, reciprocating oil scrapers and heat pipes with getters and with mechanical couplings were tested. The tests yielded the following results: (1) Bonded, split, pumping piston rings, in preliminary testing, proved a promising concept, exhibiting low leakage and friction losses. Solid piston rings proved impractical in view of their sensitivity to the operating temperature; (2) A babbit <b>oil</b> <b>scraper</b> in a compliant housing performed well in atmospheric endurance testing. In pressurized tests the scraper did not perform well as a containment seal. The latter tests suggest modifications which may adapt Ti successfully to that application; and (3) Heat pipe endurance tests indicated the adequacy of simple, inexpensive fabrication and filling procedures. Getters were provided to increase the tolerance of the heat pipes {{to the presence of}} air and commercially available couplings were demonstrated to be suitable for heat pipe application. In addition to the above tests, the program also included a design effort for a split shaft applicable to a swashplate driven engine with a pressurized crank-case. The design is aimed, and does accomplish, an increase in component life to more than 10, 000 hours...|$|E
