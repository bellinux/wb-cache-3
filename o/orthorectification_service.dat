40|$|The Agriculture and Fisheries Unit (IPSC) {{together}} with the Informatics, Networks and Library Unit (ISD) has performed this inventory called the Community Image Data portal Survey (the CID Survey); 20 Actions from 4 different Institutes (ISD, IPSC, IES, and IHCP) were interviewed. The objectives of the survey were to make an inventory of existing satellite data and future requirements; to obtain an overview of how data is acquired, used and stored; to quantify human and financial resources engaged in this process; to quantify storage needs and to query the staff involved in image acquisition and management on their needs and ideas for improvements in view of defining a single JRC portal through which imaging requests could be addressed. Within the JRC there are (including 2006) more than 700 000 low resolution (LR) and 50 000 medium resolution (MR) images, with time series {{as far back as}} 1981 for the LR data. There are more than 10 000 high resolution (HR) images and over 500 000 km 2 of very high resolution (VHR) images. For the LR and MR data, cyclic global or continental coverage dominates, while the majority of HR and VHR data is acquired over Europe. The expected data purchase in the future (2007, 2008) known which enables good planning. Most purchases of VHR and HR data are made using the established FCs with common licensing terms. Otherwise multiple types of licensing govern data usage which emphasizes the need for CID to establish adequate means of data access. The total amount of image data stored (2006 inclusive) is 55 TB, with an expected increase of 80 % in 2 years. Most of the image data is stored on internal network storage inside the corporate network which implies that the data is accessible from JRC, but difficulties arise when access is to be made by external users via Internet. In principle current storage capacity in the JRC could be enough, but available space is fragmented between Actions which therefore implies that a deficit in storage could arise. One solution to this issue is the sharing of a central storage service. Data reception is dominated by FTP data transfer which therefore requires reliable and fast Internet transfer bandwidth. High total volume for backup requires thorough definition of backup strategy. The user groups at JRC are heterogeneous which places requirements on CID to provide flexible authentication mechanisms. There is a requirement for a detailed analysis of all metadata standards needed for reference in a catalogue. There is a priority interest for such Catalogue Service and also for a centralized storage. The services to implement for data hosted on central storage should be WCS, WMS, file system access. During the analysis of the results mentioned above, some major areas could be identified as a base for common services to be provided to interested Actions, such as: provision of a centralized data storage facility with file serving functionality including authentication service, image catalogue services, data visualization and dissemination services. Specialized data services that require highly customized functionality with respect to certain properties of the different image types will usually remain the sole responsibility of the individual Actions. An <b>orthorectification</b> <b>service</b> for semi-automated orthorectification of HR and VHR data will be provided to certain Actions. At the end of the report some priorities and an implementation schedule for the Community Image Data portal (CID) are given. JRC. G. 3 -Agricultur...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{two year}} Ground European Network for Earth Science Interoperations-Digital Repositories (GENESI-DR) project was to build an open and {{seamless}} access service to Earth science digital repositories for European and world-wide science users. In order to showcase GENESI-DR, one of the developed technology demonstrators focused on fast search, discovery, and access to remotely sensed imagery {{in the context of}} post-disaster building damage assessment. This paper describes the scenario and implementation details of the technology demonstrator, which was developed to support post-disaster damage assessment analyst activities. Once a disaster alert has been issued, response time is critical to providing relevant damage information to analysts and/or stakeholders. The presented technology demonstrator validates the GENESI-DR project data search, discovery and security infrastructure and integrates the rapid urban area mapping and the near real-time <b>orthorectification</b> web processing <b>services</b> to support a post-disaster damage needs assessment analysis scenario. It also demonstrates how the GENESI-DR SOA can be linked to web processing services that access grid computing resources for fast image processing and use secure communication to ensure confidentiality of information.
