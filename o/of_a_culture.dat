5|$|Antoinette Wright, {{director}} of the DuSable Museum, has said that African American art has grown out of a need for the culture to preserve its history orally and in art due to historical obstacles {{to other forms of}} documentation. She also believes that the museum serves as a motivational tool for members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> that has experienced extensive negativity. In the 1980s, African American museums such as the DuSable endured the controversy of whether negative aspects of the cultural history should be memorialized. In the 1990s, the African American genre of museum began to flourish despite financial difficulties. In 2016, the museum formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|During {{the sixteenth}} century, Scotland {{underwent}} a Protestant Reformation {{that created a}} predominantly Calvinist national Church of Scotland (kirk), which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook. Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll {{as a result of}} Protestant iconoclasm, with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings. The nature of the Scottish Reformation may have had wider effects, limiting the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of public display and meaning that art was channelled into more austere forms of expression with an emphasis on private and domestic restraint.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{views of}} {{conscience}} usually {{see it as}} linked to a morality inherent in all humans, to a beneficent universe and/or to divinity. The diverse ritualistic, mythical, doctrinal, legal, institutional and material features of religion may not necessarily cohere with experiential, emotive, spiritual or contemplative considerations about the origin and operation of conscience. Common secular or scientific views regard the capacity for conscience as probably genetically determined, with its subject probably learned or imprinted (like language) as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E

5|$|Motives for {{collection}} of articles, such as Tipu's Tiger, are seen by literary historian Barrett Kalter {{as having a}} social and cultural context. The {{collection of}} Western and Indian art by Tipu Sultan is seen by Kalter as motivated {{by the need to}} display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly Hindu and did not share his religion, viz. Islam. In the case of the East India Company, collection of documents, artefacts and objet's d'art from India helped develop the idea of a subjugated Indian populace {{in the minds of the}} British people, the thought being that the possession of such objects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> represented understanding of, dominance over, and mastery of that culture.|$|E
5|$|Before the Reformation in the mid-sixteenth {{century the}} {{interiors}} of Scottish churches were often elaborate and colourful. Particularly in the north-east {{of the country}} there were highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Kinkell from 1524 and Deskford from 1541. Monumental effigies in churches were usually fully coloured and gilded and dedicated {{to members of the}} clergy, knights and their wives. In contrast to England, where the fashion for stone-carved monuments gave way to monumental brasses, in Scotland they continued to be produced {{until the end of the}} Medieval period. These include the very elaborate Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas and the tomb built for Alexander McLeod (d. 1528) at Rodel in Harris. Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll as a result of Reformation iconoclasm, with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings. The only significant surviving pre-Reformation stained glass in Scotland is a window of four roundels in the St. Magdalen Chapel of Cowgate, Edinburgh, completed in 1544. Wood carving can be seen at King's College, Aberdeen and Dunblane Cathedral. In the West Highlands, where there had been a hereditary caste of monumental sculptors, the uncertainty and loss of patronage caused by the rejection of monuments in the Reformation meant that they moved into another branches of the Gaelic learned orders or took up other occupations. The lack of transfer of carving skills is noticeable in the decline in quality when gravestones were next commissioned from the start of the seventeenth century. According to N. Prior, the nature of the Scottish Reformation may have had wider effects, limiting the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of public display and meaning that art was channelled into more austere forms of expression with an emphasis on private and domestic restraint.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} <b>of</b> establishing <b>an</b> {{information security}} <b>culture</b> in <b>an</b> organization {{has become a}} well established idea. The aim <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> is to address the various human factors that can affect an organization’s overall information security efforts. However, understanding both the various elements <b>of</b> <b>an</b> information security <b>culture,</b> {{as well as the}} relationships between these elements, can still be problematic. Schein’s definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corporate <b>culture</b> is often used to aid understanding <b>of</b> <b>an</b> information security <b>culture.</b> This paper briefly introduces Schein’s model. It then incorporates the important role knowledge plays in information security into this definition. Finally, a conceptual framework to aid understanding of the interactions between the various elements <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> <b>culture,</b> is presented. This framework is explained by means of illustrative examples, and it is suggested that this conceptual framework can be a useful aid to understanding information security culture...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{conduct a}} {{meta-analysis}} on the combined influence of organizational and national culture on new product performance. For this purpose, {{they refer to}} the effectiveness of value congruency and develop a conceptual model describing the fit between organizational culture types as suggested by the competing values framework and national culture, as described by Hofstede's cultural dimensions. The meta-analysis is based on 489 effect sizes taken from 123 manuscripts. The findings show that organizations with <b>a</b> market <b>culture</b> show the highest new product performance, while hierarchy-type organizations show the lowest performance. The influence of national culture variables supports the effect of value congruency, and shows that in individualistic <b>cultures</b> the impact <b>of</b> <b>a</b> clan <b>culture</b> decreases, the impact <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adhocracy <b>culture</b> type decreases with uncertainty avoidance, and the influence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hierarchy <b>culture</b> type increases with power distance. The superior effect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> market <b>culture</b> type can be matched by other organizational orientations, but in particular national cultures only. The combined findings underline the importance for firms that seek to improve the success rate of new products on international markets to consider the fit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> national <b>culture</b> with <b>a</b> firm's organizational <b>culture...</b>|$|R

25|$|Control of or {{at least}} {{inclusion}} {{in the creation of}} a cultural epic is important because the traditional epic poem like The Odyssey or Virgil’s Aeneid is, at its core, a written history.

25|$|When {{compared}} to other literary vampires of the 19th century, Carmilla is a similar product <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> with strict sexual mores and tangible religious fear. While Carmilla selected exclusively female victims, she only becomes emotionally involved with a few. Carmilla had nocturnal habits, but was {{not confined to the}} darkness. She had unearthly beauty, and was able to change her form and to pass through solid walls. Her animal alter ego was a monstrous black cat, not a large dog as in Dracula. She did, however, sleep in a coffin. Carmilla works as a Gothic horror story because her victims are portrayed as succumbing to a perverse and unholy temptation that has severe metaphysical consequences for them.|$|E
