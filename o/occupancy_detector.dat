40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{development}} of sensors, in particular the use of thermo-fluidic sensors and <b>occupancy</b> <b>detectors,</b> to achieve smart operation of air conditioning systems. Smart operation refers to the operation of air conditioners by the reinforcement of interaction to achieve both thermal comfort and energy efficiency. Sensors related to thermal comfort include those of temperature, humidity, and pressure and wind velocity anemometers. Improvements in their performance in the past years have been studied by a literature survey. Traditional occupancy detection using passive infra-red (PIR) sensors and novel methodologies using smartphones and wearable sensors are both discussed. Referring to the case studies summarized in this study, air conditioning energy savings are evaluated quantitatively. Results show that energy savings of air conditioners before 2000 was 11 %, and 30 % after 2000 by the integration of thermo-fluidic sensors and <b>occupancy</b> <b>detectors.</b> By utilizing wearable sensing to detect the human motions, metabolic rates and related information, the energy savings can reach up to 46. 3 % and keep the minimum change of predicted mean vote (∆PMV→ 0), which means there is no compromise in thermal comfort. This enables smart air conditioning {{to compensate for the}} large variations from person to person in terms of physiological and psychological satisfaction, and find an optimal temperature for everyone in a given space.

40|$|<b>Detector</b> <b>occupancy</b> is {{commonly}} used to measure traffic signal performance. Despite improvements in controller computational power, there have been relatively few innovations in occupancy-based performance measures or integration with other data. This paper introduces and demonstrates the use of graphical performance measures based on <b>detector</b> <b>occupancy</b> ratios to verify potential split failures and other signal timing shortcomings reported to practitioners by the public. The proposed performance measures combine <b>detector</b> <b>occupancy</b> during the green phase, <b>detector</b> <b>occupancy</b> during the first five seconds of the red phase, and phase termination cause (gap out or force off). These are summarized by time of day to indicate whether the phase is undersaturated, nearly saturated, or oversaturated. These graphical performance measures and related quantitative summaries provide a first-level screening and triaging tool for practitioners to assess user concerns regarding whether sufficient green times are being provided to avoid split failures. They can also provide outcome-based feedback to staff after making split adjustments to determine whether operation improved or worsened. The paper concludes by demonstrating how the information was used to make an operational decision to re-allocate green time that {{reduced the number of}} oversaturated cycles on minor movements from 304 to 222 during a Thursday 0900 - 1500 timing plan and from 240 to 180 during a Friday 0900 - 1500 timing plan...|$|R

40|$|Human {{occupancy}} {{detection and}} localization {{are important in}} a variety of smart building applications including building security, assisted living monitors, and energy-efficient heating ventilation and air cooling and lighting. Current implementation of such systems is limited by motion-sensor technologies, e. g., passive infrared (PIR) and ultrasonic sensors, which substitute as <b>occupancy</b> <b>detectors</b> but ultimately suffer from an inability to detect stationary objects. Capacitive sensing can detect stationary objects, but the technology has almost exclusively been developed for short-range human detection and localization, e. g., touch-screen human interfacing of smart devices.

From a computer vision perspective, the challenging task is how to most efficiently fuse information from multiple views in the absence of detailed calibration information and a minimum of human intervention. This thesis presents a new approach to fuse foreground likelihood information from multiple views onto a reference view without explicit processing in 3 D space, thereby circumventing the need for complete calibration. Our approach uses a homographic occupancy constraint (HOC), which states that if a foreground pixel has a piercing point that is occupied by foreground object, then the pixel warps to foreground regions in every view under homographies induced by the reference plane, in effect using cameras as <b>occupancy</b> <b>detectors.</b> Using the HOC we are able to resolve occlusions and robustly determine ground plane localizations {{of the people in the}} scene.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} elastic buffers (EBs), {{an efficient}} flow-control scheme {{that uses the}} storage al-ready present in pipelined channels in place of explicit input virtual-channel buffers (VCBs). With this approach, the channels themselves act as distributed FIFO buffers under congestion. Without VCBs, and hence virtual channels (VCs), deadlock prevention is achieved by duplicating physical channels. We develop a channel <b>occupancy</b> <b>detector</b> to apply universal globally adaptive load-balancing (UGAL) rout-ing to load balance traffic in networks using EBs. Using EBs results in up to 12 % (17 % for low-swing channels) improvement in peak throughput per unit power compared to a network using VC flow control. The power saved by eliminating VCBs is used to make channels wider, providing increased throughput that more than offsets the degradation caused by increased blocking without VCs. EB networks have identical zero-load latency to VC networks and have considerably simpler router logic as a VC allocator is not required. ...|$|E

40|$|Transformative {{impacts on}} our energy {{security}} rely on creative approaches for consumption and generation of electricity. Technological contributions can impact both areas if {{they focus on}} problems of scale. For example, occupancy-based electrical loads (HVAC and lighting) accounted for roughly 50 % of the total consumed electricity in the U. S. in 2008. Meanwhile, roughly 50 % of consumed oil in the U. S. is imported. The U. S. Department of Energy has appropriately identified "sensing and measurement" {{as one of the}} "five fundamental technologies" essential for achieving energy security. Complementing reductions in consumption with increases in deployment of fossil-fuel-independent generation (solar and wind) and energy storage (batteries, capacitors and fuel cells) will yield a two-fold impact. Lofty energy security goals can be made realizable by aggressive application of inexpensive technologies for minimizing waste and by maximizing energy availability from desirable sources. Long-standing problems in energy consumption and generation can be addressed by adding degrees of freedom to sensing and power conversion systems using multiple electrical sources. This principal drove the invention of the hybrid electric vehicle, which achieves efficiency increases by combining the energy capacity of gasoline with the flexible storage capability of batteries. Similarly, fresh strategies for electrical circuit design, control, and estimation in systems with multiple electrical sources can minimize consumption, extend the useful life of storage, and improve the efficiency of generation. A solar array constitutes a grid or network of panels or cells that may best be modeled and treated as independent sources needing careful control to maximize overall power generation. A fuel cell stack, an array of sources in its own right, is best used in a hybrid arrangement with batteries or capacitors to mitigate the impact of electrical transients. Meanwhile, room lighting constitutes a network of multiple electrostatic field sources that can be particularly useful for occupancy detection. Exploiting performance benefits of multi-source electrical networks requires an increased flexibility in the analysis required to make informed design choices.
