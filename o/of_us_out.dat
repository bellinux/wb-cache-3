500|$|Throughout {{his career}} as a composer, Stanford's {{technical}} mastery was rarely in doubt. The composer Edgar Bainton said of him, [...] "Whatever opinions may be held upon Stanford's music, and they are many and various, it is, I think, always recognised that he was a master of means. Everything he turned his hand to always 'comes off. On the day of Stanford's death, one former pupil, Gustav Holst, said to another, Herbert Howells, [...] "The one man who could get any one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> of a technical mess is now gone from us." ...|$|E
500|$|Like many musicians of his generation, Holst {{came under}} Wagner's spell. He had recoiled {{from the music}} of Götterdämmerung when he heard it at Covent Garden in 1892, but {{encouraged}} by his friend and fellow-student Fritz Hart he persevered and quickly became an ardent Wagnerite. Wagner supplanted Sullivan as the main influence on his music, and for some time, as Imogen put it, [...] "ill-assimilated wisps of Tristan inserted themselves on nearly every page of his own songs and overtures." [...] Stanford admired some of Wagner's works, and had in his earlier years been influenced by him, but Holst's sub-Wagnerian compositions met with his disapprobation: [...] "It won't do, me boy; it won't do". Holst respected Stanford, describing him to a fellow-pupil, Herbert Howells, as [...] "the one man who could get any one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> of a technical mess", but he found that his fellow students, rather than the faculty members, had the greater influence on his development.|$|E
2500|$|The {{designs were}} also criticised for not {{including}} a portrayal of Britannia, the female personification of Britain whose image {{has appeared on}} British coinage continuously since 1672. In response to the concern {{over the loss of}} Britannia, the chairman of the Royal Mint Advisory Committee stated [...] "There are 806 million Britannias in circulation at the moment [...] They will remain in circulation. They will see all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>out,</b> until they die a natural death. So whatever happens, Britannia stays around".|$|E

Her first committee assignment was the House Armed Services. In 2007, Castor voted to redeploy <b>U.S.</b> troops <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Iraq.|$|R

2500|$|When she wasn't writing, Allen and {{her husband}} were among the most visible of Manhattan's theater crowd. She would spend her later years as a script doctor and observing {{particularly}} salacious crime trials from the benches in Manhattan Criminal Court. Allen had just about given up writing any more movies from beginning to end, preferring to do lucrative rewrites. It had stopped being fun for her. Script 'development' translated to 'scripts written by committee', but the upside was that [...] "developed" [...] scripts tend to need rewrites – from outside the [...] "development circle"."A production rewrite means that the project is in production. Big money elements – directors, actors – are pay or play. There is a shooting date. The shit is in the fan. And that's where writers like me come in. Writers who are fast and reliable. We are nicely paid to do these production rewrites[...] [...] and we love these jobs. Without credit? Never with credit. If you go for credit on somebody else's work, you have to completely dismantle the structure. Who wants a job where you have to completely dismantle the structure? I only take things that I think are in reasonable shape. The director and the producer and the studio may not necessarily agree with me, but I think the script is in reasonable shape. Besides, no one but the writer ever knows how much trouble any one piece of work will be. Only the writer knows that. Only the writer. So I take what looks to me like something that is in good enough shape, yet which I can contribute to and make it worth the pay they are going to give me[...] [...] There are more than one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> there. These jobs are quick, sometimes they're even fun, and you don't have to take the terrible meetings. They're not breathing on you. They're just desperate to get a script. I've never taken anything that I knew I couldn't help. They pay good money." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "She {{has taken}} you up," [...] {{continued}} Stanbury, [...] "on altogether a different understanding. You are {{to her the}} representative of a family to whom she thinks she owes the restitution of the property which she enjoys. I was simply a member of her own family, to which she owes nothing. She thought it well to help one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> of what she regarded as her private purse, and she chose me. But the matter is quite different with you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Jefferson, drily, [...] "we'll make him, and {{you listen}} to me. We {{may have to do}} quite a few things that aren't pretty, and we have no use for sentimentality.

60|$|As agents-provocateurs, {{not alone}} were we {{able to travel}} a great deal, but our very work threw us {{in contact with the}} proletariat and with our comrades, the revolutionists. Thus we were in both camps at the same time, ostensibly serving the Iron Heel and {{secretly}} working with all our might for the Cause. There were many of us in the various secret services of the Oligarchy, and despite the shakings-up and reorganizations the secret services have undergone, they {{have never been able to}} weed all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

6000|$|The {{young man}} swore again,--fluently, volubly,--swore {{until he had}} {{come to the end of}} a varied and {{extensive}} vocabulary.

[...] "He was one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> there when we were prospecting up the Newey Valley. Look here," [...] he continued, [...] "you and I have got to have this out. Murdered, was he?

Before a hand could stay him, the boy was over the rail and curving beautifully downward after the coin. Both were in the air at the same time. It was a pretty sight. The sovereign cut the water sharply, and at the very spot, almost at the same instant, with scarcely a splash, the boy entered.|$|E
