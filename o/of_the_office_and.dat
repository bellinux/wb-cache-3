5|$|In 1916, Garran {{was made}} the first Solicitor-General of Australia (the office was then known as Commonwealth Solicitor-General) by Billy Hughes, who had since become Prime Minister. The {{creation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> Garran's appointment to it was to some degree recognition of his existing role as Permanent Head of the Attorney-General's Department, in which Garran gave legal advice to several successive governments, but it also represented a formal delegation {{of many of the}} powers and functions formerly exercised by the Attorney-General.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Patton faced Republican Eugene Goss. Goss criticized Patton for announcing that, if elected, he would seek the governor's {{office at the}} {{expiration}} of his term. Goss insisted {{that he would not}} seek the governorship if elected, and maintained that using the lieutenant governor's post as a stepping stone to the governor's office was a betrayal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> its authority. Goss ran an unorthodox campaign, limiting individual contributions to his campaign to $300 and refusing to run television commercials. Patton went on to a lopsided victory in the general election, winning 514,023votes to Goss's 250,857.|$|E

Don locks eyes with Joan when she joins them, realizing that she has, in fact, slept with Herb. Roger receives the congratulatory confirmation call from Jaguar, and the office erupts in celebration. In Don's office, Peggy informs him she has accepted a job with CGC. He thinks she is asking for a raise and attempts to negotiate salary, but she tells him {{it is not about}} money. She holds back tears as he kisses her hand. She walks out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> smiles as she waits for an elevator.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after Ben Silverman {{was named}} {{co-chairman}} of NBC's entertainment division in 2007, he asked Greg Daniels {{to create a}} new comedy series. Silverman and Daniels previously worked together on The Office, a half-hour comedy Daniels adapted from the British comedy of the same name by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Daniels wrote the pilot for what eventually became Parks and Recreation along with series co-creator Michael Schur, who had served as a writer on The Office. Daniels and Schur had been considering ideas for a possible show with cast members Rashida Jones and Aziz Ansari, but the concept for the series did not form until they learned Amy Poehler could play the lead character. Once that casting was determined, the script for the pilot episode was first written in the summer of 2008 revolving around her as a city bureaucrat seeking to turn an enormous construction pit into a park. They also decided the script would include the mockumentary comedy style <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Office</b> <b>and,</b> like that show, would allow for improvisation on set. However, they did not consider the script an Office spin-off and NBC officials vehemently insisted to media outlets that the show was a completely separate series, despite the similarities between the two shows.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{young woman}} named Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) begins a new career at Sterling Cooper as Don's secretary. She is excited {{to be working in}} Manhattan, but finds herself {{overwhelmed}} by her new surroundings. The office manager, Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks), a voluptuously beautiful and capable woman, proves more intimidating than helpful as she gives advice on how to be appealing to the men <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> how that will lead to both success in the office and a good marriage. Peggy is dismayed to find a secretary in the bathroom crying. A junior account executive named Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) makes boorish comments about Peggy's appearance and clothing, causing Don to rebuke him. On her break, Peggy goes to the office of a doctor recommended by the all-knowing Joan, where she gets a prescription for the recently introduced birth control pill, which at the time was not supposed to be prescribed to unmarried women or married women without their husband's consent. Later in the day, Peggy makes a subtle, sexually inviting gesture to Don, but he definitively rejects her advances.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J.

Contrary to Michael's wishes, Dwight stays behind and surreptitiously monitors his condition from a distance. Michael proves to be completely incapable of living out in the wild by himself. Dwight is forced to come out of hiding to save Michael when he tries to eat wild mushrooms.|$|E

5|$|The {{persecution}} in Africa {{also encouraged}} {{the development of}} Donatism, a schismatic movement that forbade any compromise with Roman government or traditor bishops (those who had handed scriptures over to secular authorities). One of the key moments in the break with the mainline Church occurred in Carthage in 304. The Christians from Abitinae {{had been brought to}} the city and imprisoned. Friends and relatives of the prisoners came to visit, but encountered resistance from a local mob. The group was harassed, beaten, and whipped; the food they had brought for their imprisoned friends was scattered on the ground. The mob had been sent by Mensurius, the bishop of the city, and Caecilian, his deacon, for reasons that remain obscure. In 311, Caecilian was elected bishop of Carthage. His opponents charged that his traditio made him unworthy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>office,</b> <b>and</b> declared itself for another candidate, Majorinus. Many others in Africa, including the Abitinians, also supported Majorinus against Caecilian. Majorinus's successor Donatus would give the dissident movement its name. By the time Constantine took over the province, the African church was deeply divided. The Donatists would not be reconciled to the Catholic Church until after 411.|$|E
5|$|Kirilenko {{was seen}} as a {{possible}} candidate for the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1977, however, First World observers tended to overrate the significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>office,</b> <b>and</b> because of it, their observation were completely off the mark. Vasili Kuznetsov, a 76-year-old man, was chosen to the office of First Deputy Chairman instead. During Brezhnev's later rule, KGB chairman Yuri Andropov gradually took over the functions and, eventually, Kirilenko's position within the Soviet leadership. In 1979, Kirilenko lost his unofficial office as supervisor of the defence industry over to Pavel Finogenov, a protegé of Dmitriy Ustinov. Kirilenko {{was seen as}} a key candidate by the West to replace Brezhnev as Soviet leader in 1982. After Brezhnev's death, Kirilenko was removed from the ruling Politburo by the new General Secretary Andropov. With his deteriorating health, having a disease known as arteriosclerosis, Kirilenko was disabled from ensuing active politics or protecting himself from Andropov's attacks. After Brezhnev's death and funeral, Kirilenko's mental condition deteriorated to where he could not remember the names of several leading Politburo members. He was unable to write properly during his later life; when asked by Andropov to write a letter of resignation in 1982, he was unable to do so. The decision to remove Kirilenko was taken before Andropov rose to power, so in the event Brezhnev had died later, Kirilenko would still have been forced to resign. The reason for the decision was that Kirilenko's son had tried to defect to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>and</b> warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes {{time for him to}} roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E

25|$|A {{controversy}} {{erupted in}} 1982, when it emerged that some historic items {{given to the}} Hall had been sold on the collectibles market.

25|$|Hucker's system has, in the main, {{not been}} adopted by the {{scholarly}} community.

With the crystallization of church order improvisation in prayer largely gave place to set forms, and collections of prayers were made which later developed into Sacramentaries and Orationals. The collects of the Breviary are largely drawn from the Gelasian and other Sacramentaries, and they are used to sum up the dominant idea of the festival in connection with which they happen to be used.|$|E
