40|$|Aims: Rhinitis {{symptoms}} frequently {{occur in}} bakery-workers. Yet, {{little is known}} about the pathophysiology of this condition. The objective of the present study was to examine nasal indices of inflammation in relation to occupational dust exposure, occupational rhinitis according to defined criteria, rhinitis symptoms associated to the workplace, and <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization</b> in bakery-workers. Methods: Bakery-workers (n = 197) were subjected to interviews, questionnaires, workplace dust measurements, allergy tests, and nasal lavages with and without histamine. alpha(2) -Macroglobulin and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were measured in saline lavages as indices of plasma exudation and eosinophilic activity, respectively. Histamine lavages were employed to explore the nasal exudative responsiveness. Results: alpha(2) -Macroglobulin and ECP increased significantly by increased workplace dust exposure (P <= 0. 035). Furthermore, the exudative responsiveness to histamine increased significantly by such exposure (P <= 0. 016). Similar patterns were seen in workers with occupational rhinitis and in subjects with rhinitis symptoms associated to the workplace, but not in workers with <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization.</b> Conclusions: We conclude that occupational dust exposure in bakery-workers is associated with nasal eosinophilic exudative inflammation. In contrast, <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization</b> is not a discriminating factor with regard to indices of eosinophilic, exudative inflammation in the present material...|$|E
40|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{bronchial}} hyperresponsiveness have previously {{been established in}} the general community. In settings where occupational asthma is a risk, {{it has not been}} established whether <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization</b> or measures of exposure are important. Bronchial responsiveness to histamine was measured in a cohort of 506 workers exposed to acid anhydrides. Skin-prick tests were performed with conjugates of phthalic, maleic and trimellitic anhydride with human serum albumin and with common inhalant allergens. Employment and smoking histories were recorded. Occupational exposure was measured using personal air samplers and estimates of past exposure made by retrospective exposure assessment. Three hundred and seventy workers (73 %) had bronchial responsiveness measured (median age 39 yrs, range 18 - 77) and 46 (12 %) of these were hyperresponsive (provocative dose causing a 20 % fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1; PD 20) < or = 8 micromol). Twelve (3 %) of these responsive workers had a skin-prick test reaction to an acid anhydride conjugate, 124 (34 %) to a common inhalant allergen, and 148 (40 %) were current smokers. Multivariate analysis showed that <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization,</b> sensitization to a common inhalant allergen, age, and pack-years of smoking were independent risk factors for bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Of these only <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization</b> was completely independent of baseline FEV 1. It is concluded that sensitization to acid anhydrides is a significant risk factor for bronchial hyperresponsiveness. However, measures of personal acid anhydride exposure were not associated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness...|$|E
40|$|Background: Sensitization to {{occupational}} allergens {{is frequently}} found in laboratory animal workers (LAWs) {{and can cause}} serious health problems. Atopy is a major risk factor for sensitization, but it is considered insufficient to advise against working with animals. Objective: We investigated whether immunologic measures, including serology and cytokine production profiles of blood cells, and parameters for airway inflammation {{are associated with the}} development of <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization.</b> Methods: In a prospective cohort study 110 starting LAWS were followed for 2 years. At inclusion, results of health questionnaires, skin test results, lung function measures, methacholine threshold levels, and nasal lavage fluid were obtained. Blood was taken for measuring total IgE and allergen-specific IgE antibodies. Cytokine production profiles were measured in whole blood. Results: Twenty-two new cases of sensitization were identified during follow-up. In multivariate logistic regression analysis a model including atopy and total IgE level predicted sensitization best. This was corroborated in a separate validation cohort. Parameters for airway inflammation or cytokine production profiles did not further contribute to the prediction of sensitization. Based on these results, pre-employment counseling aimed at applicant LAWS with atopy and a total IgE level of greater than 100 IU/mL might be able to reduce <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization</b> by up to 45 % to 50 % with less than 10 % false-positive predictions. Conclusion: The combination of atopy and total IgE level offered the best model to predict development of <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization.</b> other immunologic parameters and parameters of airway inflammation did not contribute significantly.

40|$|Background Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) {{is common}} in bakery workers. The {{relation}} between bronchial responsiveness measured with a tidal breathing method and smoking, airway symptoms, IgE-sensitization, nasal indices of inflammation and flour dust exposure have been studied with bronchial responsiveness expressed as a continuous outcome. Material and methods Bakery workers (n = 197) were subjected to interviews, questionnaires, allergy tests, workplace dust measurements and bronchial metacholine provocation. Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and alpha(2) -macroglobulin were measured in nasal lavage. Bronchial responsiveness was expressed as slope(conc), a measurement based on regressing the per cent reduction in FEV 1 at each provocation step. Results BHR expressed as slope(conc) was associated with smoking (P = 0. 009), asthma symptoms at work (P = 0. 001), and <b>occupational</b> IgE <b>sensitization</b> (P = 0. 048). After adjusting for baseline lung function the association between BHR and IgE sensitization was no longer present. We demonstrated an association between nasal ECP and BHR (slope(conc) < 3 : P = 0. 012), but not to alpha(2) -macroglobulin in nasal lavage. No association was seen between BHR and current exposure level of flour dust, number of working years in a bakery or a history of dough-making. Conclusions BHR is related to baseline lung function, work-related asthma symptoms, smoking and nasal eosinophil activity, but not to <b>occupational</b> IgE <b>sensitization</b> and current flour dust exposure when measured with metacholine provocation. The slope(conc) expression {{seems to be a}} useful continuous outcome in bronchial responsiveness testing...|$|R

40|$|Background Cough-variant asthma (Corrao’s syndrome) {{is defined}} as the {{presence}} of chronic non-productive cough in patients with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and response to bronchodilator ther-apy. This variant of asthma may present a diagnostic problem in occupational medicine. Aims To describe additional evaluation of cough-variant asthma in a cyanoacrylate-exposed worker in whom standard diagnostic testing was negative. Methods A female beautician was evaluated for suspected occupational allergic rhinitis and asthma. A specific inhalation challenge test (SICT) was performed with cyanoacrylate glues used for applying artifi-cial eyelashes and nails. Spirometry and peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements were recorded hourly for 24 h; methacholine challenge testing was performed and nasal lavage (NL) samples were analysed for eosinophilia. Results After SICT, the patient developed sneezing, nasal airflow obstruction and cough. Declines in forced expiratory volume in 1 s and PEF were not observed. Eosinophil proportions in NL fluid increased markedly at 4 and 24 h after SICT. A significant increase in BHR also occurred 24 h after SICT. Conclusions Clinical symptoms, post-challenge BHR and increased NL eosinophil counts confirmed a positive response to SICT and validated the diagnosis of cough-variant occupational asthma. SICT may be useful in cases where history and clinical data suggest cough-variant asthma and spirometric indices are negative.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} has been to {{investigate}} the frequency of sensitization to horse allergens and clinical symptoms in horse riders. Material and Methods: A total of 42 horse riders and 50 healthy individuals were examined by means of skin prick tests for a panel of horse and common animal allergens, and pulmonary function tests were done by spirometry. Results: The rate of sensitization to horse allergens was 31 % as proven by the skin prick test in horse riders whereas horse sensitization was not seen in the control group. Occupational allergy symptoms were reported by 19 horse riders. Two horse riders with no history of clinical symptoms showed positive skin reactions to horse allergens. Conclusions: To decrease the high risk of <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization</b> among horse riders, workplace conditions should be improved to reduce the load of airborne horse allergens...|$|E
40|$|Allergy to Diplotaxis erucoides pollen: <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization</b> and {{cross-reactivity}} {{with other}} common pollens Background: Diplotaxis erucoides {{is a common}} weed of the Brassicaceae family widespread in southern and central Europe. Methods: A total of 410 consecutive patients referred for allergy study of rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma were skin tested with D. erucoides pollen, 14 proving positive. A purified D. erucoides pollen extract was prepared to perform quantitative skin tests, provocation tests, immunoblotting, and EIA inhibition in the 14 sensitized patients. Results: Three patients, directly involved in viniculture, had rhinoconjunctivitis related to D. erucoides pollen. No D. erucoides-related symptoms were observed in most patients, who were also sensitized to Artemisia pollen. RAST was positive in 12 / 14 patients and nasal provocation tests in 9 / 12. The molecular masses of the most prevalent IgE-binding proteins ranged from 26 to 27. 5 and from 31 to 34 kDa. D. erucoides pollen inhibited the IgE-binding of other sensitizing pollens in the three viniculture workers, whereas both Artemisia and D. erucoides pollen produced similar heterologous inhibition in the pooled serum of the remaining, nonclinically affected, D. erucoides-sensitized patients. Conclusions: D. erucoides pollen {{may be an important}} prevalent aeroallergen, particularly in rural areas. It may act as an occupational allergen in vineyard workers, in whom {{it seems to be the}} primary sensitizing agent, playing a secondary cross-reactive role in other sensitized patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Sensitization to flour or fungal {{alpha-amylase}} is {{a prerequisite}} for the development of respiratory allergy in bakers. The knowledge of <b>occupational</b> allergen <b>sensitization</b> among bakery workers will facilitate the implementation of preventive measures for respiratory allergies in bakeries. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence and factors associated with sensitization to wheat flour and α-amylase in bakers in Douala. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 42 of the 151 bakeries that are present in the city of Douala. Demographics, clinical data, as well as results of skin prick tests to wheat flour, α-amylase and common aeroallergens were collected from all participants. A logistic regression model of the SPSS. 20 software was used to identify factors associated with sensitization to wheat flour and α-amylase. Results: Of the 229 participants included in the study, 222 (96. 9 %) were male. The mean age was 36. 3 ± 8. 9 years. The prevalence of sensitization to flour and α-amylase were 16. 6 % and 8. 3 % respectively. After multivariate analysis, factors associated with sensitization to flour were work seniority and sensitization to storage mites while an age of 30 years and above was the only factor associated with sensitization to α-amylase. Conclusion: Bakers in Douala are at risk of <b>sensitization</b> to <b>occupational</b> allergens.

40|$|Abstract Background Animal-derived allergens include lipocalins which play an {{increasing}} role in <b>occupational</b> respiratory <b>sensitizations.</b> The prevention of sensitization in stock farming {{is often difficult}} due to intense exposure, with traditional milking still requiring close animal contact. Complete avoidance of allergen exposure is only possible if stock farming is abandoned. This is, however, often not feasible in small dairy plants because of the resulting loss of income. Case presentation In a 37 -year-old female farmer daily asthmatic complaints appeared, associated with cow dust-derived allergen exposure by milking with a conventional device. Respiratory symptoms increased {{during a period of}} 12 years. Allergic bronchial asthma was diagnosed, caused by sensitization against cow dust-derived allergens, as demonstrated by positive skin prick test and by detection of IgE antibodies. In a separate specific inhalation challenge test using a 10 % extract of cow dust-derived allergens a 330 % increase of airway resistance was detected. To enable further dairy farming, a milking robot was installed in 1999, i. e., an automatic milking system. The novel milking technique reduced the daily exposure from over 2 hours to approximately 10 min. The clinical course after the installation of the milking robot was favourable, with less frequent allergic and asthmatic symptoms. Furthermore, asthma medication could be reduced. Improvement was noted also in terms of lung-function and decreased total serum IgE. Conclusion The case presented and the evidence from the literature indicates that the strategy of exposure minimization to allergens at workplaces can be an effective alternative to total elimination. In farmers with cow dust allergy a milking robot is an appropriate technical measure to minimize allergen-exposure. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To study {{snow crab}} <b>sensitization,</b> <b>occupational</b> allergy and asthma {{in the snow}} crab {{industry}} in Greenland, as high rates {{have been found in}} Canada, but no reports have emerged from the same industry in Greenland. Study design. Pilot survey. Methods. Twenty workers (19 of Inuit and 1 of other origin) in a snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) and Atlantic shrimp (Pandalus borealis) processing plant in Greenland were assessed with skin prick tests (SPTs) with common aeroallergens and specific allergens from snow crab and shrimp extracts, spirometry, blood sampling for total IgE and specific IgE determination. Eighteen workers contributed a questionnaire-based medical interview. Results. Positive skin prick test reactions were common to snow crab (40 %) and shrimp (20 %). Specific IgE to snow crab were positive in 4 workers (21 %). Two workers had elevated total IgE levels. Symptoms suggestive of asthma were common (45 %). Work-related symptoms of skin rash, rhinitis, and/or conjunctivitis were reported by 50 %, and symptoms from the lower airways by 39 %. Combining history of work-related symptoms with results from specific SPTs and/or specific IgE determination suggested that 11 and 22 % of workers suffered from probable and possible occupational asthma, respectively, whereas 22 % had possible occupational dermatitis or rhinitis. Conclusions. Greenlander Inuit {{do not appear to be}} protected against sensitization to snow crab or shrimp when occupationally exposed to these.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{the results of}} a {{cross-sectional}} epidemiological study undertaken in the period from March 2000 to January 2002 on bakery workers in 6 bakeries in Bergen, Norway. The aims were to study the consequences of different criteria for the diagnosis of occupational rhinitis (OcR), assess the prevalence of IgE sensitization, and to explore the relationships between OcR, upper and lower airway symptoms, IgE-sensitization, nasal indices of inflammation, bronchial responsiveness, and flour dust exposure. We have taken into account possible confounders such as age, gender, smoking, and baseline lung function, and we also present an alternative continuous outcome estimate of bronchial responsiveness. Bakery workers (n= 197) were subjected to interviews, questionnaires, workplace dust measurements, allergy tests, and nasal lavages with and without histamine provocation. The criteria for the diagnosis of OcR were based on the International Consensus Report on Rhinitis (ICR) from 1994. α 2 -Macroglobulin and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were measured in nasal lavage fluid. Bronchial provocation test with metacholine was carried out according to the American Thoracic Society’s guidelines. Bronchial responsiveness was expressed as slopeconc, a measurement derived by regressing the percent reduction in FEV 1 at each provocation step. The prevalence of OcR varied between 23 and 50 % depending on the diagnostic criteria used. OcR, both IgE- and non-IgE-mediated, was associated with asthma symptoms. The most frequent causes of sensitization were various species of storage mites (20 %). Storagemite sensitization was related to both OcR and work exposure (production workers versus administrative staff). α 2 -Macroglobulin, ECP, and the exudative responsiveness to histamine increased significantly with increasing workplace dust exposure (p≤ 0. 035). Similar patterns were seen in workers with OcR and with work related rhinitis symptoms, but <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization</b> was not a discriminating factor. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) expressed as slopeconc was associated with smoking (p= 0. 017) and asthma symptoms at work (p= 0. 003), but not with IgE sensitization to occupational allergens (p= 0. 221) when we also adjusted for baseline lung function. We demonstrated an association between ECP in nasal lavage and BHR in a subgroup where BHR was defined as slopeconc < 3 (p= 0. 012). No association was seen between bronchial responsiveness and current exposure level of flour dust, nasal symptoms, and a diagnosis of OcR. Using different diagnostic criteria have considerable consequences for the prevalence of OcR. There is a strong relationship between OcR and lower airway symptoms. Storage mites maybe important occupational allergens in Norwegian bakeries. OcR and occupational dust exposure in bakery workers is associated with nasal eosinophilic exudative inflammation. In contrast, <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization</b> is not a discriminating factor with regard to nasal indices of eosinophilic, exudative inflammation. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness measured by metacholine provocation is related to baseline lung function, smoking, work related asthma symptoms, and nasal eosinophil activity, but not to occupational IgE sensitization. The slopeconc expression seems to be a useful continuous outcome in bronchial responsiveness testing with metacholine...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims at {{demonstrating the}} development, validation, and {{application}} of prediction models for occupational lung diseases. Prediction models are developed to estimate an individual’s probability of the presence or future likelihood of occurrence of an outcome (i. e. disease of interest or its related condition). These models are used to assist clinical decision making for individuals, or to stratify individuals into risk groups with a different likelihood for developing disease or with disease severity. In this thesis {{the development of a}} diagnostic model is described to detect sensitization to wheat allergens among bakery workers. This model made use of questionnaire items only. Secondly a more generic model was developed for sensitization to high molecular weight allergens in bakery workers (exposed to wheat and or fungal alpha amylase allergens) and laboratory animal workers (exposed to rat and or mouse urinary allergens). The third diagnostic model included questionnaire items and lung function test results to predict the probability of having chest X-ray changes indicative for pneumoconiosis in Dutch construction workers exposed to silica dust. All diagnostic models were transformed into easy-to-use scoring systems to facilitate their application in practice. These diagnostic models enable objective and standardized quantification of the probability of having or developing disease without performing (invasive) advanced and costly reference test. We also developed prognostic models for occurrence of <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization</b> and respiratory symptoms in apprentices in animal health technology. The prognostic value of questionnaire items, skin-prick tests, and bronchial challenge to methacholine, as a single test or in combination with others, was assessed. Another element in the thesis was to assess the generalizability of a prediction model. Different statistical approaches were used to externally validate a questionnaire model for sensitization to LA allergens -developed in Dutch workers- in Canadian animal health technology apprentices. A new model was eventually developed in Canadian apprentices and compared to the original Dutch model. Model revision was done to evaluate if inclusion of new predictors from the Canadian setting could improve the performance of the original model. Finally the application of a diagnostic model for <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization</b> is described in a surveillance program for respiratory diseases in baking and flour-producing industries in the Netherlands. The diagnostic model was applied in 5, 325 Dutch bakery and flour and enzyme exposed workers. This chapter illustrates how a diagnostic model may improve the efficiency of surveillance programs. After assuring that a model is valid and produces accurate predictions, it is important to determine probability cut-off points to stratify individuals into risk categories. The choice for a cut-off point must be based on the balance between the proportion of missed cases and reduction of unnecessary diagnostic tests. This thesis shows that predicting lung diseases in the context of occupational health care and practice is possible. The use of the prediction tools assists the decision making process and would hopefully reduce expenses. Application of prediction models has not been fully explored but efforts to increase the use of predictive models deserve strong support...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Several studies, mostly {{based on}} questionnaire-derived data, have shown an {{increased}} risk of allergic diseases, especially asthma, among cleaners. The risk factors and etiological mechanisms are still being investigated. Occupational exposure to various chemical and biological agents may induce specific sensitization and/or irritant effects. The aim of our study was to estimate the prevalence of work-related symptoms suggesting the presence of allergic disease reported by cleaners, and to relate them to the results of commercially available and standardized objective tests used for screening detection of <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization</b> and chronic respiratory disorders. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed among 142 Polish workers of cleaning service in their workplaces. A detailed questionnaire, skin prick tests to common allergens and chemicals used by these workers for cleaning purposes (chloramine T, chlorhexidine, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, benzalconium chloride), total and specific serum IgE antibodies to disinfectants and rest spirometry were performed in all the subjects. Results: Fifty nine percent of all the subjects declared occurrence of at least 1 symptom suggesting allergic ailment during cleaning activities at work. Skin prick tests and specific serum IgE antibodies to disinfectants were negative in all the subjects. In 8 cases wheezing was detected during auscultation, but only in 5 of them obstructive pattern in rest spirometry was found. Conclusions: Occupational allergic causation of symptoms among cleaners could be less likely than work-related symptoms associated with exacerbations of new-onset or pre-existing respiratory diseases. Therefore, in this group of workers, mainly the non-specific irritant impact of chemicals on airways should be taken into consideration...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: <b>Occupational</b> {{allergic}} contact <b>sensitization</b> {{is common}} in dental personnel. Some {{of the most common}} occupational allergens in dental practice are some formaldehyde-releasers, formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde. Aim: The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the rate of contact sensitization to formaldehyde, quaternium- 15, imidazolidinyl urea, diazolidinyl urea, and to glutaraldehyde in students of dental medicine and dental patients. Material and methods: A total of 50 participants were included in the study: 40 students of dental medicine exposed to formaldehyde-releasers, formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde during the course of their education; 10 dental patients without occupational exposure to the latter substances served as a control group. All of them were patch-tested with the studied allergens. Results: The sensitization rate to formaldehyde was significantly higher in the group of dental patients if compared to the one of dental students (χ 2 = 5. 37; p= 0. 021). Positive skin patch test reactions to quaternium- 15 and to imidazolidinyl urea were observed only in the group of dental students. A significantly higher rate of sensitization to diazolidinyl urea, if compared to the one to imidazolidinyl urea (χ 2 = 5. 4; p= 0. 02) and to quaternium- 15 (χ 2 = 6. 76; p= 0. 009), as well as to glutaraldehyde, if compared to the one to quaternium- 15 (χ 2 = 3. 96; p= 0. 04) for the whole studied population was established. For the whole studied population, significantly increased rate of concomitant sensitization to formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde (χ 2 = 6. 18 p= 0. 013), as well as to diazolidinyl urea and to glutaraldehyde was established (χ 2 = 9. 12 p= 0. 003). Conclusions: We consider the importance of exposure to diazolidinyl urea, quaternium- 15, imidazolidinyl urea and glutaraldehyde during the course of practical education in dentistry for the onset of sensitization. The exposure to formaldehyde is ubiquitous and is difficult to distinguish the roles of environmental and occupational exposures. The promotion of proper personal protection as well as adequate information on occupational chemical hazards should start as early as during the first years of education in dentistry...|$|R
40|$|Strong contact sensitizers {{are able}} to induce signal {{transduction}} mechanisms such as tyrosine phosphory-lation and activation of MAP kinases in antigen-presenting cells. We studied the capacity of different antioxidants (ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, N-acetylcysteine, and glutathione) to block the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in human monocytes seen after stimulation with strong contact sensitizers. Human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} were stimulated with 5 -chloro- 2 -methylisothiazolinone plus 2 -methylisothiazolinone in {{the presence or absence of}} these antioxidants. The total amount of membrane-associated phosphotyrosine in CD 14 + cells was quantified using flow cytometric techniques. Complete inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation was noticed when cells were stimulated in the presence of N-acetylcysteine or glutathione. Using N-acetylcysteine as inhibitor similar results were obtained for cells stimulated with formaldehyde, thimerosal methyldibromoglutaronitrile, diphenylcyclopropenone, p-phenylenediamine, toluene- 2, 5 -diamine, and 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene. By use of a trinitrophenyl-specific monoclonal antibody it was shown that N-acetylcysteine as well as cysteine prevents the binding of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrochlorobenzene to proteins in monocytes and monocyte-derived mature dendritic cells. Furthermore, the capacity of N-acetylcysteine to block the activation of p 38 and ERK 1 / 2 MAP kinases by 2, 4, 6 -trinitrochlorobenzene was demonstrated. The radical scavengers ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol as well as the nuclear factor κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate failed to prevent the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. Our data present evidence that reactive oxygen species as well as transcription factor nuclear factor κB seem to be unimportant for the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by contact sensitizers. On the other hand, protection of thiol groups using compounds with free sulfhydryl groups is very effective to block this process. This finding may have implications for prevention of <b>occupational</b> <b>sensitization</b> to strong contact allergens...|$|E
