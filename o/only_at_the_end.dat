Bisguier stood well in the middlegame, but blundered, handing Fischer his fifth consecutive U.S. championship.|$|E
5|$|The regiments of the Bar Confederation, whose {{executive}} board {{had been forced}} to leave Austria (which previously supported them) after Austria joined the Prusso-Russian alliance, did not lay down their arms.

In the end, the Bar Confederation was defeated, with its members either fleeing abroad or being deported to Siberia by the Russians.|$|E

5|$|Place d'Armes {{is one of}} {{the largest}} squares in the city of Calais, adjoins the watchtower, and during medieval times was once the heart of the city. While Calais was a {{territory}} of England (1347–1558), it became known as Market Square (place du Marché). <b>Only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of English rule did it take the name of Place d'Armes. After the reconquest of Calais in 1558 by Francis, Duke of Guise, Francis II gave Calais the right to hold a fair twice a year on the square, which still exists today, as well as a bustling Wednesday and Saturday market.|$|E
5|$|The manga series Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray explores Kira's {{survival}} {{after the}} Strike's defeat; a technician named Lowe Guele finds Kira wounded and takes him to Reverend Malchio.

In Mobile Suit Gundam SEED C.E. 73 Δ Astray Kira makes a brief appearance; he kidnaps Cagalli from Orb during the events of Gundam SEED Destiny. He has also been featured in two character CDs from the series, with tracks performed by his Japanese voice actor, Sōichirō Hoshi.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of Verona on 18 October 1805, André Masséna led the converged light {{companies}} of his army supported by two infantry divisions in an assault {{crossing of the}} river on Verona's west side. The French stormed across the Castelvecchio Bridge and quickly captured San Giorgio, but Vukassovich threw more infantry and cavalry into the struggle for the heights, which lasted most of the day. A French diversion at Pescantina occupied his right flank brigade, keeping {{it out of the}} fight. Meanwhile, a second diversion at Albaredo d'Adige fooled Charles into thinking it was the main attack. <b>Only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the day did Count Heinrich von Bellegarde appear with reinforcements, {{but it was too late}} to stop Masséna from establishing a bridgehead on the hills to the north of the city. Believing that Vukassovich held the riverbank with too few troops, archduke dismissed him from command and appointed Prince Franz Seraph of Rosenberg-Orsini as his replacement. Another account asserts that Vukassovich was sacked because he placed a number of cannons in an exposed position in violation of Charles' orders. At Verona, the Austrians suffered 1,622 casualties and loss of four cannons, while the French only lost about 450 killed and wounded.|$|E

5|$|Indian {{troops were}} not {{originally}} {{eligible for the}} VC, because since 1837 they had been eligible for the Indian Order of Meritthe oldest British gallantry award for general issue. When the VC was created, Indian troops were still controlled by the Honourable East India Company, and did not come under Crown control until 1860. European officers and men serving with the Honourable East India Company were not eligible for the Indian Order of Merit; the VC was extended to cover them in October 1857. It was <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the 19th century that calls for Indian troops to be awarded the VC intensified. Indian troops became eligible for the award in 1911. The first awards to Indian troops appeared in the London Gazette on 7 December 1914 to Darwan Singh Negi and Khudadad Khan. Negi was presented with the VC by King George V two days earlier, on 5 December 1914, {{during a visit to}} troops in France. He is one of a small number of soldiers presented with his award before it appeared in the London Gazette.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{was known}} for {{fostering}} {{the development of new}} writers without worrying about maximizing profits, and for printing works on principle, even if he knew they would make little money. His risky publication of Joel Barlow's Advice to the Privileged Orders (1792), for example, sold 600 copies and barely broke even. He was also instrumental {{in the creation of the}} female professional writer, a role that began opening to women <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the 18th century in Britain. By nurturing the writings of Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Charlotte Smith, Mary Hays, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Maria Edgeworth, he gave women the opportunity to demonstrate that they could be both successful and significant authors. Additionally, he published works promoting women's equality, such as Hays's An Appeal to the Men of Great Britain (1798), which called for an end to the tyrannical rule of men over women; Johnson's Analytical Review reviewed the work extensively and approvingly.|$|E

5|$|Once all {{the tissue}} {{compartments}} have reached saturation {{for a given}} pressure and breathing mixture, continued exposure will not increase the gas loading of the tissues. From this point onwards the required decompression remains the same. If divers work and live at pressure for a long period, and are decompressed <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the period, {{the risks associated with}} decompression are limited to this single exposure. This principle has led to the practice of saturation diving, and as there is only one decompression, and it is done in the relative safety and comfort of a saturation habitat, the decompression is done on a very conservative profile, minimising the risk of bubble formation, growth and the consequent injury to tissues. A consequence of these procedures is that saturation divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in the slowest tissues, whereas bounce divers are more likely to develop bubbles in faster tissues.|$|E
5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|E

25|$|The {{degradation}} of polymers to form smaller molecules may proceed by random scission or specific scission. The {{degradation of}} polyethylene occurs by random scission—a random breakage of the bonds that hold the atoms of the polymer together.

Other polymers, such as poly(alpha-methylstyrene), undergo specific chain scission with breakage occurring <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends.</b> They literally unzip or depolymerize back to the constituent monomer.|$|R
