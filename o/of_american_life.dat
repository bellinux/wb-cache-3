It recognized important literary and non-fiction works {{that contributed to}} the understanding and interpretation <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>life</b> and culture. Winners of the award were considered literary ambassadors who provide, in the best contemporary English, an important window on America {{to the rest of the}} world. A panel of judges selected books out of new works in the fields of fiction, biography, autobiography, current affairs, American studies and poetry.|$|E
5|$|The Interstate grew quickly, {{along with}} the {{automobile}} industry, allowing a new-found mobility that permeated ways <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>life</b> and culture. The automobile and the Interstate became the American symbol of individuality and freedom, and, for the first time, automobile buyers accepted that the automobile they drove indicated their social standing and level of affluence. It became a statement of their personality and an extension of their self-concepts.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Lowell also {{published}} The Biglow Papers, later {{named by the}} Grolier Club as the most influential book of 1848. The first 1,500 copies sold out within {{a week and a}} second edition was soon issued—though Lowell made no profit, as he had to absorb the cost of stereotyping the book himself. The book presented three main characters, each representing different aspects <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>life</b> and using authentic American dialects in their dialogue. Under the surface, The Biglow Papers was also a denunciation of the Mexican–American War and war in general.|$|E

5|$|Robinson's character, {{his use of}} nonviolence, and his {{unquestionable}} talent {{challenged the}} traditional basis of segregation which then marked many other aspects <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>life.</b> He influenced the culture of and {{contributed significantly to the}} Civil Rights Movement. Robinson also was the first black television analyst in MLB, and the first black vice president of a major American corporation, Chock full o'Nuts. In the 1960s, he helped establish the Freedom National Bank, an African-American-owned financial institution based in Harlem, New York. After his death in 1972, in recognition of his achievements on and off the field, Robinson was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal and Presidential Medal of Freedom.|$|E
5|$|Sheryl Crow is {{the second}} studio album by American singer Sheryl Crow, {{released}} on September 24, 1996 by A Records. Unlike its predecessor Tuesday Night Music Club, which was written by a casual collective formed by Crow and several other musicians, Sheryl Crow was entirely produced by Crow, who wrote most of the songs alone or with only one collaborator. Most of the album was recorded at Kingsway Studio in New Orleans, Louisiana. The album covers topics <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>life,</b> relationship breakups, and moral and ethical issues, while encompassing a variety of music genres such as rock, blues, alternative rock, country, and folk.|$|E
5|$|While {{staying in}} Cornish in 1908, Hand began a close {{friendship}} with the political commentator and philosopher Herbert Croly. At the time, Croly was writing his influential book The Promise <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>Life,</b> in which he advocated a program of democratic and egalitarian reform under a national government with increased powers. When the book was published in November 1909, Hand sent copies to friends and acquaintances, including former president Theodore Roosevelt. Croly's ideas had a powerful effect on Roosevelt's politics, influencing his advocacy of New Nationalism {{and the development of}} Progressivism.|$|E

5|$|Between 1910 and 1916, Hand {{tried to}} {{translate}} his political philosophy into political action. Having read Croly's The Promise <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>Life</b> and its anti-Jeffersonian plea for government intervention in {{economic and social}} issues, he joined the Progressive Party. However, he discovered that party politicking was incompatible not only with {{his role as a}} judge but with his philosophical objectivity. The pragmatic philosophy Hand had imbibed from William James at Harvard required each issue to be individually judged on its merits, without partiality. In contrast, political action required partisanship and a choice between values. After 1916, Hand preferred to retreat from party politics into a detached skepticism. His belief in central planning resurfaced during the 1930s in his growing approval of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, as he once again—though this time as an observer—endorsed a program of government intervention. Hand was also an interventionist on foreign policy, supporting U.S. involvement in both world wars, and disdained isolationism.|$|E
5|$|By 2003, Madonna {{suggested}} {{that she was in}} a revolutionary mood, which led to journalistic discussions that another image makeover would take place for her. Still recovering from the commercial disappointment of Swept Away, Madonna changed her image completely to resemble that of a fighter, with inspirations from pictures of Argentinian guerrilla leader Che Guevara. French design team M/M Paris (Michael Amzalag and Mathias Augustyniak) were responsible for the artwork <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>Life.</b> The duo are best known for their collaborations with musicians and Madonna hired the duo after discussing the concept for just six minutes. The photo shoot for the album was done by photographer Craig McDean in January 2003 at Los Angeles, and cost a reported $415,000. McDean had already worked with Madonna for the cover of Vanity Fair magazine in October 2002; this shoot had a military theme, with Madonna posing in dark green and black clothes, combat boots, and guns.|$|E
5|$|Seething {{beneath the}} surface <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>life</b> in the Depression was {{the fear of the}} angry mob, portrayed in panicked {{hysteria}} in films such as Gabriel Over the White House (1933), The Mayor of Hell (1933), and American Madness (1932). Massive wide shots of angry hordes, comprising sometimes hundreds of men, rush into action in terrifyingly efficient uniformity. Groups of agitated men either standing in breadlines, loitering in hobo camps, or marching the streets in protest became a prevalent sight during the Great Depression. The Bonus Army protests of World War I veterans on the capital in Washington, D.C., on which Hoover unleashed a brutal crackdown, prompted many of the Hollywood depictions. Although social issues were examined more directly in the pre-Code era, Hollywood still largely ignored the Great Depression, as many films sought to ameliorate patrons' anxieties rather than incite them.|$|E

5|$|The costliest war in U.S. {{history in}} terms <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>life,</b> this {{war has been}} the subject of, or the {{backdrop}} to, numerous films, documentaries and mini-series. One of the earliest films using the Civil War as its subject was D.W. Griffith's 1910 silent picture, The Fugitive. Films that have the war as its main subject, or about a certain aspect of the war include the 1989 film, Glory, about the first formal unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War to be made up entirely of black men. Some films such as Gettysburg focused on a single battle during the war, or even on a single incident, like the French short film, La Rivière du Hibou (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge). Others like the 1993 miniseries North and South spanned the entire breadth of the war. Some films deal with the human aspects of the war, such as The Red Badge of Courage (1951), or Shenandoah (1965), on the tragedy that the war inflicted on the civilian population. Ken Burns's The Civil War is the most watched documentary in the history of PBS.|$|E
