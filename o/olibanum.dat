60|$|It is very {{singular}} {{that the}} elevation of this table-land (1100 feet at Shahgunj) should coincide {{with that of the}} granite range of Upper Bengal, where crossed by the grand trunk road, though they have no feature but the presence of alluvium in common. Scarce a hillock varies the surface here, and the agricultural produce of the two is widely different. Here the flat ledges of sandstone retain the moisture, and give rise to none of those impetuous torrents which sweep it off the inclined beds of gneiss, or splintered quartz. Nor is there here any of the effloresced salts so forbidding to vegetation where they occur. Wherever the alluvium is deep on these hills, neither Catechu, <b>Olibanum,</b> Butea, Terminalia, Diospyros, dwarf-palm, or any of those plants are to be met with, which abound wherever the rock is superficial, and irrespectively of its mineral characters.|$|E
60|$|I left Belcuppee on the 8th of February, {{following}} Mr. Williams' camp. The {{morning was}} clear and cold, the temperature only 56 degrees. We crossed the nearly dry broad bed of the Burkutta river, a noble stream during the rains, carrying along huge boulders of granite and gneiss. Near this I passed the Cholera-tree, a famous peepul by the road side, so called from a detachment of infantry having been attacked and decimated at the spot by that fell disease; it is covered with inscriptions and votive tokens {{in the shape of}} rags, etc. We continued to ascend to 1360 feet, where I came upon a small forest of the Indian <b>Olibanum</b> (Boswellia thurifera), conspicuous from its pale bark, and spreading curved branches, leafy at their tips; its general appearance is a good deal like that of the mountain ash. The gum, celebrated throughout the East, was flowing abundantly from the trunk, very fragrant and transparent. The ground was dry, sterile, and rocky; kunker, the curious formation mentioned at Chapter 1, appears in the alluvium, which I had not elsewhere seen at this elevation.|$|E

Ḳ. 14b; Sanh. 63a). If favorable evidence comes to light, the flag-bearer gives the signal, and the rider turns the procession back to the court where the new evidence is duly considered. Indeed, the convict's own declaration that he can prove his innocence, or mitigating circumstances, cause a stay until he is heard. And even where he fails to effect a reversal of sentence by his first attempt, there is still hope left for him. He may repeat the attempt several times, two scholars accompanying him for the purpose of hearing him and judging whether further delay should be permitted. On arriving in the neighborhood of the scaffold, he is exhorted to make confession of his sins, though not specifically of the crime for which he is to suffer death (see Confession of Sin). Thereupon he is given to drink a mixture of wine and <b>olibanum,</b> that he may become stupefied and not realize the painful close of his earthly career (Sem. ii. 9; Sanh. 43a; compare Mark xv. 23; contrast Matt. xxvii. 34).

5000|$|Naked Indian (also {{known as}} gumbo limbo), or Bursera simaruba, in particular, {{is found in}} Florida, Mexico, the Caribbean, Venezuela, and Brazil. The tree is also named the ‘tourist tree’ for its very {{distinctive}} flaking red bark; apparently, the tree occurs in tropical areas where many white tourists go on vacation. The resin from this tree {{can be used to}} make varnish and turpentine. In addition, the resin may also be used similarly to tiger balm (containing Cinnamomum camphora of the Lauraceae) to relieve sprains and muscle aches. The leaves are used to brew a tea to relieve inflammation. The bark serves as an antidote to skin irritation caused by Metopium toxiferum (also known as poisonwood, Florida poison tree, and hog gum) of the Anacardiaceae. The gumbo limbo grows quickly and {{can be used to make}} a living fence especially out of cut limbs that are placed straight into the ground or for restoration projects as a pioneer species. The tree is highly tolerant of high-intensity wind such as hurricane-force winds, so is planted in areas where hurricanes occur frequently, such as Florida and the Caribbean. The seeds of this species are also a source of food for birds. Frankincense, or <b>olibanum,</b> (Boswellia carterii) and myrrh (Commiphora abyssinica) have long been valued for the aromatic resins they produce. These resins are extracted via tapping, or cutting of the bark to make it release sap. The liquid sap hardens and is gathered, sold as is or further processed and mixed with spices, seeds, and roots to make various forms of incense. Both species are native to parts of Northeast Africa (Somalia, frankincense; Somalia and Ethiopia, myrrh) and Arabia (Oman and Yemen, frankincense), but their distribution and use have been extended beyond these regions to India and China. The best frankincense is grown in Oman and the incense is widely used in worship in India. The ancient Egyptians prized frankincense for the resin they used to make the characteristic dark eyeliner and myrrh as an embalming agent for deceased pharaohs. At that time, myrrh was worth more than gold. In modern times resins from these trees are used in Chinese herbal medicine and Indian Ayurvedic medicine to treat several ailments. Pills containing small doses of frankincense and other ingredients are valued in oriental medicine for promoting blood flow and the movement of the qi (‘life force’ or ‘spiritual energy’). and myrrh is similarly claimed to promote blood flow, stimulate the stomach and digestion, and to be useful in treating diabetes, menopause, uterine tumors, amenorrhoea, and dysmenorrhea. Both frankincense (containing triterpene acids) [...] and myrrh are used to relieve pain and inflammation as in arthritis and asthma.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to evaluate <b>Olibanum</b> resin, a natural resin polymer as matrix polymer for controlled release tablets and to design matrix tablets of diclofenac for controlled release. Matrix tablets of diclofenac were formulated employing <b>Olibanum</b> resin in different proportions of drug and polymer and the tablets were evaluated for drug release kinetics and mechanism. Two diluents namely lactose (water soluble) and DCP (water insoluble) were included in the formulations to assess their influence on drug release characteristics of <b>olibanum</b> resin matrix tablets. Matrix tablets were found t¬o be non- disint-egrating in water, acidic (pH 1. 2) and alkaline (pH 7. 4) fluids and were considered suitable for oral controlled release. Diclofenac release from the matrix tablets formulated was slow and spread over 24 h and depended on the concentration (%) of <b>olibanum</b> resin in the matrix tablets and nature/type of diluent. As the concentration of <b>olibanum</b> resin in the matrix tablets was increased, drug release was decreased. Release was relatively faster with water soluble diluent lactose when compared to water insoluble diluent DCP at all concentrations of <b>olibanum</b> resin. Drug release from the tablets followed first order kinetics and followed non - Fickian (anomalous) diffusion release mechanism. Good linear relationships were observed between percent polymer and release rate in each case. The results of the study thus indicated <b>olibanum</b> resin could be used as rate controlling matrix in design of controlled release tablets. Both water soluble and water insoluble diluents can be included in the <b>olibanum</b> resin matrix tablets without affecting its rate controlling efficiency.

40|$|Abstract Diabetes is {{a common}} {{metabolic}} disease {{in the world that}} has many adverse effects. <b>Olibanum</b> gum resin (from trees of the genus Boswellia) has traditionally been used in the treatment of various diseases such as diabetes. The aim of this study was the comparison of <b>Olibanum</b> gum resin effect with placebo on the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Inclusion criteria was diabetic patients with fasting blood sugar (FBS) = 140 - 200 mg/dL. This study has been designed as double-blined clinical trial on 71 patients with type 2 diabetes and the patients randomly were divided to interventional and placebo groups. The patients on standard antidiabetic therapy (metformin) treated with <b>Olibanum</b> gum resin (400 mg caps) and placebo tow times per day for 12 weeks, respectively. At the end of the twelfth week, the FBS, HbA 1 c, Insulin, total Cholesterol (Chol), LDL, Triglyceride (TG), HDL and other parameters were measured. The <b>Olibanum</b> gum resin lowered the FBS, HbA 1 c, Insulin, Chol, LDL and TG levels significantly (p 0. 05) compared with the placebo at the endpoint. Moreover, this plant showed anti-oxidant effect and also no adverse effects were reported.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to evaluate <b>olibanum</b> resin, a natural lipophilic polymer for its application as microencapsulating agent and to prepare and evaluate <b>olibanum</b> resin-coated microcapsules of carbamazepine for controlled release. Controlled release formulations are needed for carbamazepine to avoid erratic absorption, fluctuating plasma concentrations and associated toxicity and patient compliance. <b>Olibanum</b> resin coated microcapsules of carbamazepine were prepared by emulsification-solvent evaporation method and the microcapsules were evaluated for controlled release. The resin coated microcapsules prepared are spherical, discrete, free flowing and were of multinucleate and monolithic type. Microencapsulation efficiency was in the range 99. 0 - 100. 7 %. Carbamazepine release from the microcapsules was slow over 24 h and depended on core:coat ratio, wall thickness and size of the microcapsules. Drug release was by Fickian diffusion when the drug release was relatively rapid {{as in the case of}} microcapsules of smaller size, OMC 1, OMC 2 and OMC 3 of size 35 / 50. The release was by non-Fickian diffusion when the drug release was more slow as in the case of all microcapsules of size 20 / 35 and microcapsules, OMC 4 of size 35 / 50. Good linear relationship was observed between wall thickness of the microcapsules and release rate. <b>Olibanum</b> resin was found suitable as a new microencapsulating agent and the resin coated microcapsules exhibited good controlled release characteristics. Carbamazepine release from the <b>olibanum</b> resin coated microcapsules, OMC 3 (size 20 / 35) was similar to that from Trigretal CR tablets, a commercial controlled release formulation of carbamazepine...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation {{was to develop a}} sustained release (SR) tablet formulation of glipizide by employing two hydrophobic polymers (ethyl cellulose and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer) and two natural hydrophilic gum resins <b>olibanum</b> resin and colophony). Different batches of glipizide sustained release tablets were prepared by using lactose and dicalcium phosphate as diluents by wet granulation technique. The prepared tablets were evaluated for various parameters. In vitro drug release study was carried out and compared with the commercial Glynase XL tablets. The independent model method, Lin Ju and Liaw’s difference factor (ƒ 1) and similarity factor (ƒ 2) were used to compare various dissolution profiles. The dissolution profiles of an ideal formulation (SR F 3) containing <b>olibanum</b> resin and lactose as diluent was found to be comparable with the reference product. The kinetics of drug release was best explained by Korsmeyer and peppas model and the mechanism of drug release from these tablets was by non-fickian diffusion mechanism.

40|$|The insecticidal {{effect of}} six commercially {{available}} plant oils was tested against 4 th larval instars of Culex pipiens. Larvae were originally collected from Meit El-Attar, Qalyubia Governorate, Egypt, and then reared {{in the laboratory}} until F 1 generation. The LC 50 values were 32. 42, 47. 17, 71. 37, 83. 36, 86. 06, and 152. 94 ppm for fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-grecum), earth almond (Cyperus esculentus), mustard (Brassica compestris), <b>olibanum</b> (Boswellia serrata), rocket (Eruca sativa), and parsley (Carum ptroselinum), respectively. The tested oils altered some biological aspects of C. pipiens, for instance, developmental periods, pupation rates, and adult emergences. The lowest concentrations of <b>olibanum</b> and fenugreek oils caused remarkable prolongation of larval and pupal durations. Data also showed that the increase of concentrations was directly proportional to reduction in pupation rates and adult emergences. Remarkable decrease in pupation rate was achieved by mustard oil at 1000 ppm. Adult emergence was suppressed by earth almond and fenugreek oils at 25 ppm. In addition, the tested plant oils exhibited various morphological abnormalities on larvae, pupae, and adult stages. Consequently, fenugreek was the most potent oil and the major cause of malformation of both larval and pupal stages.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{explore the}} {{potential}} of essential oil, as therapeutic molecule source, from <b>olibanum</b> of Boswellia papyrifera (Burseraceae), leafy stems of Cymbopogon schoenanthus (Poaceae) and Croton zambesicus (Euphorbiaceae) and rhizome of Cyperus rotundus (Cyperaceae) found in Sudan. Respective essential oil was evaluated for anti-proliferative, antibacterial and antioxidant activity. MethodsEssential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation and then analysed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Anti-proliferative activity was determined against human cell lines (MCF 7 and MDA-MB 231, HT 29 and HCT 116) by the {{thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide}} (MTT) procedure. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by diphenyl 2 pycril hydrazil (DPPH) assay. Antibacterial activity was determined against two Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria by microdilution method. ResultsThe essential oil from <b>olibanum</b> of Boswellia papyrifera contained mainly alcohol and ester derivatives (46. 82 %) while monoterpenes (69. 84 %) dominated in Corton zambesicus oil. Sesquiterpenes were the most highly represented classes of terpene derivatives in Cyperus schoenanthus (71. 59 %) and Cyperus rotundus (44. 26 %). Oil of Cymbopogon schoenanthus revealed the best anti-proliferative activity against HCT 116  cell line with IC 50 value at (19. 1  ±  2. 0) μg/mL. Oil of Croton zambesicus showed the best antioxidant activity [EC 50 (4. 20  ±  0. 19) mg/mL]. All oils showed good antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value ranged from 16 to 250  μg/mL.
