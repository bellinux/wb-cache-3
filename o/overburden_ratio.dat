This paper presents different theoretical & numerical analysis of anchor plates in loose and dense sand. Numerical methods {{can be used to}} estimate the ultimate pullout capacity of anchor plates. This paper discussed different theories and numerical analysis in anchors plates from previous researchers. Analyses, beginning from Meyerhof & Adams (1968) until the most recent analysis such as Sakai & Tanaka (1998) are reviewed. The analysis is pioneered by Vesic (1971), Sarac(1989) and Smit (1989), Krishna(2000), Fargic and Marovic (2003), Merfield and Sloan(2006), Dickin & Lama(2007), Kumar and Bhoi (2008), Kuzer & Kumar(2009) and Niroumand and Kassim(2010).

40|$|The {{viability}} of using surface seismic techniques in {{the exploration of}} shallow coal deposits in the UK is investigated. The geological factors that affect the economic {{viability of}} a prospective site are the <b>overburden</b> <b>ratio</b> {{and the presence of}} faulting, drift channels and previous mine workings. The seismic refraction technique using both congressional (P) waves and shear (S) waves is used and also the P wave reflection technique. The P wave source used is explosive and the shear wave source is a horizontal hammer. Seven site surveys are described, six in North East England, and one in the North West. The refraction technique using the Plus-Minus and Generalized Reciprocal Methods of interpretation is used to locate faults, estimate drift cover thicknesses and pinpoint areas of previous opencast excavation. Faults are located by a change in refractor velocity, or by a sudden change in refractor depth. Shear waves display a greater ability to image sharp depth anomalies than P waves, due to the greater velocity contrast between consolidated and unconsolidated rocks that S waves exhibit. S waves are better lithological indicators than P waves as there exist distinct ranges of S wave velocities for unconsolidated (150 to 400 m/sec) and consolidated (650 to 1400 m/sec) rocks. The fundamental problem with shallow reflection surveys on land is that the shallow reflections occur {{at the same time as}} surface waves and ground roll. The reflection technique is used to locate faults and detect the boundaries of old mine workings. No reflections shallower than 70 m are recorded, and in areas of thick glacial drift cover no frequencies higher than l 00 Hz are detected. The results of the survey to locate positions of old mine workings are inconclusive, although some features seen on the final sections could be related to boundaries between unworked and worked strata...|$|E

40|$|Laboratory {{ultrasonic}} {{experiments were}} made on artificial soil samples in order to observe the effects of slight <b>overburden,</b> sand/clay <b>ratio</b> and pore fluid saturation on compressional and shear wave velocities. Up to several meters of overburden were simulated by applying low uniaxial stress of about 0. 1 MPa to a restrained sample. Samples were fabricated from Ottawa sand mixed with a swelling clay (Wyoming bentonite). The amount of clay added was 1 to 40 percent by mass. Most measurements were made under room-dry conditions, but some measurements were made for fully-saturated sand-clay mixtures and for partially-saturated sand samples. For the dry sand-clay samples, compressional (P) velocities were low, ranging from about 200 to 500 m/s for the mixtures at low stress. Shear (S) velocities were {{about half of the}} compressional velocity, about 70 to 250 m/s. Dramatic increases in all velocities occurred with small uniaxial loads, indicating strong nonlinearity. Composition and grain packing control the mechanical response at grain contacts and the resulting nonlinear response at low stresses. P and S velocities are sensitive to the amount of clay added, even at low concentrations. At these low equivalent overburden conditions, adhesion and capillarity at grain contacts affect wave amplitudes, velocities, and frequency content in the partial saturation case...|$|R

40|$|The frontal {{thrust of}} the Oregon accretionary prism scrapes off about 2 km of {{incoming}} sedimentary section and underlies a fault-bend fold of the first ridge landward of the abyssal plain. Scarps with associated chemosynthetic biological communities at the surface and pore-water anomalies at depth indicate that the frontal thrust is tectonically and hydrologically active. At Site 891, near seismic line OR- 5, the thrust splits into at least three splays from 375 to 500 mbsf. The upper splay is defined in the cores by strongly developed scaly fabric and is mostly positive polarity on seismic reflection lines. The middle splay shows low to moderate deformation in the cores. Drilling did not penetrate the lower splay. The middle and lower splays are mostly nega-tive polarity on the seismic reflection data. At Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 891 the upper splay is marked by increased velocity and density on borehole logs, which explains its positive polarity reflection. In core samples the middle splay is associ-ated with a velocity and density decrease about 10 m thick that explains its negative polarity reflection. Four techniques were used to estimate fluid pressure from the anomalously porous interval associated with the middle splay of the frontal thrust: (1) comparison of porosity and effective overburden to an undeformed reference section in Cascadia Basin; (2) comparison of the porosity-depth profile over this interval with the normally consolidated porosity-depth function determined from one-dimensional consolidation tests on recovered samples; (3) comparison of the undrained shear strength/ <b>overburden</b> pressure <b>ratio</b> (...|$|R
40|$|The current {{design of}} MSE walls, {{which is based on}} limit state analysis, does not apply to {{undrained}} conditions. Laboratory and numerical pullout tests are performed to determine the relation between drained and undrained pullout capacities for different soil types (clean sand, 5, 10, 15 and 35 % silty sand), overburden pressures (30, 100 and 200 kPa), and scale and permeability effects in the dissipation of excess pore pressures. The results of the pullout tests show that both drained and undrained pullout capacities change as silt content changes since the pullout capacity increases as the internal friction angle of the soil increases. It is also observed that the pullout capacity increases as the overburden pressure increases. Undrained conditions significantly reduce the pullout capacity as much as 50 %. This is caused by the generation of excess pore pressures in the soil under rapid loading which decrease the effective stress at the soil-reinforcement interface. The magnitude of the pullout reduction is related to the permeability of the soil since for large permeabilities the dissipation of excess pore pressures is very rapid and no reduction in pullout is produced; in contrast for low permeabilities the dissipation of excess pore pressures is slower than the rate of pullout and thus a reduction occurs. This is confirmed by the experiments that show no reduction in pullout capacity for clean sand, and a large reduction for silty sands. The ratio of undrained to drained pullout capacity changes with silt content and overburden pressure; for 100 and 200 kPa <b>overburden</b> pressure, the <b>ratio</b> is 1. 0 for clean sand, 0. 67 ~ 0. 69 for 5 % silty sand, 0. 77 ~ 0. 78 for 10 %, 0. 72 ~ 0. 73 for 15 %, and 0. 57 ~ 0. 59 for 35 % silty sand.

It is observed in the numerical analyses that the dissipation of pore pressures is very rapid for permeabilities larger than 10 - 2 cm/sec, and significantly slow for permeabilities smaller than 10 - 3 cm/sec. Scale effects are extremely important since as the length of the reinforcement increases the time for pore pressures to dissipates increases...|$|R

Many New Zealand coalfields are however complicated structurally, with multiple seams and extensive folding and faulting. Coal seams are characterised by variable dip, thickness, and quality over relatively short distances.

The proximity of these deposits to major infrastructure (including towns, highways and rail lines), significant environmental features such as the Waikato river and lakes, and valuable dairy farmland, add further complexity. Traditional preliminary mine planning techniques applied in these conditions are insufficient. Pit optimisation software, widely used in the metalliferous mining industry since the 1980 s, offers the ability to analyse many more specific factors affecting pit limits, mine layouts, and economics, with more rigour and for a much larger number of scenarios, than traditional methods allow. SENZ therefore decided to adapt and use ‘Whittle’ pit optimisation software for Level 2 analysis of several Waikato opencast prospects. This paper describes this work...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} some of {{the results}} of a visit to Russia between 7 - 17 th June 2005 to study the Coal Mine Methane and Abandoned Mine Methane resources of the Kuznetsk (Kuzbass) Coal basin, Siberia, Russia. Coal Mine Methane (CMM) refers to gas drained from working coal mines and Abandoned Mine Methane (AMM) refers to mine gas derived from closed mines. This visit formed part of the UK – Russia Cleaner Fossil Fuel Technology Transfer Project: AMM/CMM Technology Transfer Opportunities in Russia. The UK team comprised experts from Wardell Armstrong, British Geological Survey (BGS), IT Power and Climate Mitigation Works; Uglemetan provided support whilst in Russia. The role of the BGS was to evaluate the CMM and AMM resources of the Kuzbass Coal Basin and, if possible, to apply the UK scheme for resources and reserves assessment on the basis of such data as was available in Russia. However, due to significant problems in obtaining suitable data whilst in Russia, a Kuzbass-wide assessment of AMM and CMM resources was not possible. Hence this report represents a review of existing published and non-published data and meetings held during the visit to Russia in 2005, where they impact on AMM and CMM resources. This report is not a definitive assessment of the CMM and AMM resources and reserves of the Kuzbass and the conclusions reached are tentative. Hence it is recommended that more detailed studies be carried out in order {{gain a better understanding of}} the CMM and AMM resources and reserves in the Kuzbass. The Kuzbass Coal Basin covers an area of approximately 26, 000 km and is thought to contain 263. 7 billion tonnes of coal reserves. The main coal-bearing intervals are from the Permo-Carboniferous Kolchuginsky and Balakhonsky stages and, typically, the coal to <b>overburden</b> (non-coal) <b>ratio</b> is about 3. 5 : 1. The area is geologically complex, with large folds and thrust folds dominating.

40|$|In {{the design}} {{phase of a}} shallow tunnel, one of the {{relevant}} aspects {{to take into consideration}} is the stress release generated in the neighbourhood of the excavation. In fact, the material removal causes a variation of the initial state of stress and the stress release induces surface subsidence. In urban areas, surface settlements must be evaluated in order to properly perform risk analysis on buildings above the line, the so-called BRA, Building Risk Assessment. The three-dimensional modelling of the problem better simulates the digging conditions and the progress of the excavation face, but the analyses are time-consuming. On the other hand, the two-dimensional modelling requires a moderate computational time, but a method to simulate the ground stress release, generated during the excavation phases, has to be chosen. In the following study, the surface subsidence induced by a traditional excavation is evaluated by using a finite-difference numerical simulation with FLAC 3 D. A parametric analysis to highlight the influence of different parameters on the maximum surface subsidence and on stress release is performed. The analysed parameters are the H/D <b>ratio</b> (<b>overburden</b> divided by tunnel diameter), the K 0 coefficient and the unsupported length. Subsequently, a two-dimensional FEM modelling is performed with the software PLAXIS, to compare the 3 D and 2 D results.

40|$|Opencast mining alters {{surface and}} {{subsurface}} hydrology {{of a landscape}} both during and post-mining. At mine closure, following opencast mining in mines with low <b>overburden</b> to coal <b>ratios,</b> a void is left in the final landform. This final void is {{the location of the}} active mine pit at closure. Voids are generally not infilled within the mines' lifetime, because of the prohibitive cost of earthwork operations, and they become post-mining water bodies or pit lakes. Water quality is a significant issue for pit lakes. Groundwater within coal seams and associated rocks can be saline, depending {{on the nature of the}} strata and groundwater circulation patterns. This groundwater may be preferentially drawn to and collected in the final void. Surface runoff to the void will not only collect salts from rainfall and atmospheric fallout, but also from the ground surface and the weathering of fresh rock. As the void water level rises, its evaporative surface area increases, concentrating salts that are held in solution. This paper presents a study of the long term, water quality trends in a post-mining final void in the Hunter Valley, New South Wales, Australia. This process is complex and occurs long tern, and modelling offers the only method of evaluating water quality. Using available geochemical, climate and hydrogeological data as inputs into a mass-balance model, water quality in the final void was found to increase rapidly in salinity through time (2452 to 8909 mg l(- 1) over 500 years) as evaporation concentrates the salt in the void and regional groundwater containing high loads of salt continues to flow into the void.

40|$|This study {{identifies}} the relative magnitude of horizontal stress change below {{a series of}} parallel longwall panels {{as a consequence of}} multi-seam mining. The investigation method yields an upper bound to the horizontal stress change by assuming that the fractured and caved overburden above the supercritical longwall panels is not able to support any lateral load. Finite element modelling was conducted to consider the effects of the following variables on the horizontal stress redistribution: the ratio of the equivalent width of the extracted area to the <b>overburden</b> depth, the <b>ratio</b> of the original horizontal to vertical in situ stress components, and anisotropy in the rock mass behaviour. The key findings of this research are that the maximum horizontal stress induced as a consequence of extracting multiple supercritical longwall panels will be within approximately 10 % of the original in situ horizontal stress for the case of isotropic rock strata. The magnitude of this horizontal stress may be larger in a stiff stratum if the overall sequence of strata consists predominantly of softer rocks. Anisotropy in the strata underlying the extracted longwall panels also causes an increase in the maximum horizontal stress induced into the immediate floor of the first extracted seam, and an increase in the rate of dissipation of horizontal stress change with depth. These findings indicate that a significant increase in horizontal stress relative to the original in situ horizontal stress should not be expected in multi-seam mining situations. The results from this study need to be considered in conjunction with predicted vertical stress distributions in order to accurately predict the overall stress environment likely to be encountered when conducting multi-seam mining...|$|R

The salt layers often contain significant impurities. GRI and DOE have initialized this research proposal {{in order to increase}} the gas storage capabilities by providing operators with improved geotechnical design and operating guidelines for thin bedded salt caverns. Terralog has summarized the geologic conditions, pressure conditions, and critical design factors that may lead to: (1) Fracture in heterogeneous materials; (2) Differential deformation and bedding plane slip; (3) Propagation of damage around single and multiple cavern; and (4) Improved design recommendations for single and multiple cavern configurations in various bedded salt environments. The existing caverns within both the Permian Basin Complex and the Michigan and Appalachian Basins are normally found between 300 m to 1, 000 m (1, 000 ft to 3, 300 ft) depth depending on local geology and salt dissolution depth. Currently, active cavern operations are found in the Midland and Anadarko Basins within the Permian Basin Complex and in the Appalachian and Michigan Basins. The Palo Duro and Delaware Basins within the Permian Basin Complex also offer salt cavern development potential. Terralog developed a number of numerical models for caverns located in thin bedded salt. A modified creep viscoplastic model has been developed and implemented in Flac 3 D to simulate the response of salt at the Permian, Michigan and Appalachian Basins. The formulation of the viscoplastic salt model, which is based on an empirical creep law developed for Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Program, is combined with the Drucker-Prager model to include the formation of damage and failure. The Permian salt lab test data provided by Pfeifle et al. 1983, are used to validate the assumptions made in the material model development. For the actual cavern simulations two baseline models are developed for single and multiple caverns, respectively. Different parameters that affect damage propagation and deformation of salt cavern, such as cavern pressure, operating conditions, cavern height/diameter <b>ratio,</b> <b>overburden</b> stiffness and roof thickness are analyzed and the respective results summarized.

Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityIn this research work, {{a comprehensive review of}} investigations into pipe jacking operations, and in particular the forces generated during the process, is presented. The factors affecting these forces were examined and their influence was studied in order to give a clear indication on the their magnitude and behaviour. A model scale testing facility, based on a 1. 8 m X 1. 5 m X 1. 5 m high steel tank, has been developed together with hydraulic jacking facilities and scale model pipes of 200 mm diameter having both steel and concrete surfaces. In this facility the actual pipe jacking operation can be simulated, so that a study of the jacking forces could be made with the use of appropriate instrumentation techniques and computerised data recording. A series of tests was conducted to examine the influence of several parameters on the jacking forces, such as overcut ratio, type of soil, type of pipe surface, overburden pressure, and the rate of jacking. These parameters were in relation to the distance jacked. Two granular soils, uniformly graded Leighton Buzzard sand and well-graded River sand, were used as the material surrounding the pipeline, that is the material through which the pipes were jacked. Laboratory analysis on the soil materials was conducted and the relationship between results obtained from these tests and scale model testing were established. The interface friction between the surface of the pipeline and the surrounding soil was determined. The results show a peak in the jacking forces {{at the start of the}} jacking process, followed by a decrease and leveling off as the jacking continued. The graph is very similar to the stress/strain relationship of a typical granular soil. Both steel and concrete pipes were used in the tests to detennined the influence of pipe surface, and to a lesser degree pipe joint, characteristics. Higher forces were recorded for concrete pipes. The jacking rate was kept constant and consistent for all tests. It was found to have little effect on the magnitude of the jacking forces. The jacking forces were measured automatically using a computer. The results show a clear trend of increase in the jacking forces when the overburden pressure and jacking length were increased. Tests using different overcut ratios have indicated that a minimum jacking force might be achieved at a specific overcut ratio. The results of this research show that the jacking forces are influenced by a number of parameters. These include the <b>overburden</b> pressure, overcut <b>ratio,</b> pipe diameter, jacking length and the influence of the surrounding material. This is fully demonstrated by establishing a method of jacking forces prediction, termed herein the Loughborough Method...|$|R
