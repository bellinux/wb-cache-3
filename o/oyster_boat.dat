60|$|I {{saw that}} this was a place of wonders. In a sea turn or shallow fog while I was there the next summer, it being clear overhead, the edge of the bank twenty rods distant, {{appeared}} like a mountain pasture in the horizon. I was completely deceived by it, and I could then understand why mariners sometimes ran ashore in such cases, especially in the night, supposing it to be far away, though they could see the land. Once since this, being in a large <b>oyster</b> <b>boat</b> two or three hundred miles from here, in a dark night, when there was a thin veil of mist on land and water, we came so near to running on to the land before our skipper was aware of it, that the first warning was my hearing the sound of the surf under my elbow. I could almost have jumped ashore, and we were obliged to go about very suddenly to prevent striking. The distant light for which we were steering, supposing it a light-house five or six miles off, came through the cracks of a fisherman's bunk not more than six rods distant.|$|E

50|$|The {{skipjack}} is {{a traditional}} fishing boat used on Chesapeake Bay for oyster dredging.

50|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, {{the area was}} an {{overnight}} coach stop between New York City and Philadelphia. In 1836, a public park was built. In the middle 19th century, the area began to attract immigrants from Ireland and Germany. Among the industries established in the area was the only whale oil processing plant on Staten Island. It was later replaced by a linseed oil processing plant that operated until the 20th century. Other industries included lumber and coal yards, as a dye processing plant. Because oyster harvesting was a booming business along the mudflats in New York Harbor, many successful <b>oyster</b> <b>boat</b> captains built mansions on Richmond Terrace facing the Kill van Kull in the 1840s and 1850s. Industries along the waterfront included lumber and coal yards.|$|E

Caroline is fragile, beautiful, and musically talented--everything Sara Louise is not. As the chosen favorite of the island and Sara Louise's family, Caroline absorbs all of the attention, time, and love Sara Louise is desperate for.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] Edna E. Lockwood [...] is a Chesapeake Bay bugeye, {{the last}} working <b>oyster</b> <b>boat</b> of her kind. She {{is located at}} the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in Saint Michaels, Maryland. She was built in 1889 at Tilghman Island, Maryland by John B. Harrison and is of nine-log construction, similar to the smaller log canoe, and was {{launched}} on October 5, 1889 for Daniel Haddaway, at a cost of $2,200. She worked for at least seven sets of owners from 1899 until 1967, and was then sailed as a yacht until donated to the museum in 1973. The museum undertook an extensive restoration of the Lockwood from 1975 through 1979, which restored the bugeye to its 1910 appearance with the [...] "patent stern" [...] that had been added sometime prior to that year. She is the last bugeye retaining the sailing rig and working appearance of the type. Her length is 53.5 ft, with a 15.25 ft beam and a draft of 2.58 ft with the centerboard up, and a maximum sail area of approximately 1700 square feet.|$|E

50|$|The bugeye was {{originally}} constructed with a log hull, {{and as the}} supply of appropriate timber was exhausted and construction costs rose, builders looked to other designs. They adapted the sharpies of Long Island Sound by increasing the beam and simplifying the sail plan. The result was cheaper and simpler to construct than the bugeye, and it quickly became the predominant <b>oystering</b> <b>boat</b> in the bay.|$|R
