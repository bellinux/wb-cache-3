Fifteen target odorous VOCs (odorants) were selected. Air samples were collected at dairy barns in Wisconsin and Indiana and at swine barns in Iowa and Indiana over a one-year period. The livestock facilities with these barns participated in the National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS). Gas concentrations, <b>odor</b> character and <b>intensity,</b> hedonic tone, and odor peak area of the target odorants in air samples were measured simultaneously with GC-MS-O. The four individual odorants emitted from both dairy and swine sites with the largest odor impacts (measured as odor activity value, OAV) were 4 -methyl phenol, butanoic acid, 3 -methyl butanoic acid, and indole. The total odor (limited to target VOCs and {{referred to as the}} measured concentrations, <b>odor</b> <b>intensities,</b> and OAVs) emitted from the swine sites was generally greater than that from the dairy sites. The Weber-Fechner law was used to correlate measured <b>odor</b> <b>intensities</b> with chemical concentrations.

5000|$|The odor {{character}} is encoded in {{the ratio of}} activities of receptors tuned to different vibration frequencies, {{in the same way}} that color is encoded in the ratio of activities of cone cell receptors tuned to different frequencies of light. An important difference, though, is that the odorant has to be able to become resident in the receptor for a response to be generated. The time an odorant resides in a receptor depends on how strongly it binds, which in turn determines the strength of the response; the <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> is thus governed by a similar mechanism to the [...] "lock and key" [...] model. For a pure vibrational theory, the differing odors of enantiomers, which possess identical vibrations, cannot be explained. However, once the link between receptor response and duration of the residence of the odorant in the receptor is recognised, differences in odor between enantiomers can be understood: molecules with different handedness may spend different amounts of time in a given receptor, and so initiate responses of different intensities.|$|E

40|$|The {{olfactory}} {{evaluation function}} (e. g., <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> rating) of e-nose is always {{one of the}} most challenging issues in researches about odor pollution monitoring. But odor is normally produced by a set of stimuli, and odor interactions among constituents significantly influenced their mixture’s <b>odor</b> <b>intensity.</b> This study investigated the odor interaction principle in odor mixtures of aldehydes and esters, respectively. Then, a modified vector model (MVM) was proposed and it successfully demonstrated the similarity of the odor interaction pattern among odorants of the same type. Based on the regular interaction pattern, unlike a determined empirical model only fit for a specific odor mixture in conventional approaches, the MVM distinctly simplified the <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> prediction of odor mixtures. Furthermore, the MVM also provided a way of directly converting constituents’ chemical concentrations to their mixture’s <b>odor</b> <b>intensity.</b> By combining the MVM with usual data-processing algorithm of e-nose, a new e-nose system was established for an <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> rating.

Five pyrazines were successfully identified, 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine being the most abundant. Although 2 -ethyl- 5 -methylpyrazine was in lower levels, it presented the highest odor units, due to its low threshold. RWPS enhanced the formation of the five identified pyrazines (2. 1 times), without relevant changes in the proportion between them. The highest increase was observed for 2 -ethyl- 6 -methylpyrazine (3 times higher than in control). These results were corroborated by electronic nose analysis, presenting RWPS beef patties higher <b>odor</b> <b>intensities.</b> Mechanisms to explain these effects are also proposed in the present work, and the high content of polyphenols seems to be the major cause of the observed results.

Here we show in naive flies that Galphaq-mediated signaling in MB modulates spontaneous discrimination of odor identity but not <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> (concentration). In contrast, experience-dependent modification (conditioning) of both odor identity and intensity occurs in MB exclusively via Galphas-mediated signaling. Our data suggest that spontaneous responses to odor identity and <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> discrimination are segregated at the MB level, and neural activity from MB further modulates olfactory processing by experience-independent Galphaq-dependent encoding of odor identity and by experience-induced Galphas-dependent encoding of <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> and identity...|$|E

We analyzed FPA-R occurrence to repeated olfactory stimulation with low and high 1 -hexanol concentrations that are behaviorally attractant and repellent, respectively, in the blowfly. FPA-R occurrence diminished and ceased with repeated presentations of low and medium odor concentrations, according to dynamics inversely related to odor doses. On the other hand, repeated stimulation with higher odor concentrations induced persistent FPA-Rs. Sensory input amplitude to repeated presentations of singly tested odor concentrations did not change throughout stimulation sessions. A spontaneous restoration of FPA-R to olfactory stimulation was recorded 30 min after cessation of FPA-R to a previous olfactory stimulation session. However, a prompt restoration of FPA-R to olfactory stimulation after cessation of FPA-R was obtained following mechano-taste stimulation of labellar sensilla.

40|$|SummaryAlthough human {{perception}} of food flavors involves integration of multiple sensory inputs, {{the most salient}} sensations are taste and olfaction [1]. Ortho- and retronasal olfaction are particularly crucial to flavor because they provide the qualitative diversity so important to identify safe versus dangerous foods [2]. Historically, flavor research has prioritized aroma volatiles present at levels exceeding the orthonasally measured odor threshold [3], ignoring the variation in {{the rate at which}} <b>odor</b> <b>intensities</b> grow above threshold. Furthermore, the chemical composition of a food in itself tells us very little about whether or not that food will be liked. Clearly, alternative approaches are needed to elucidate flavor chemistry. Here we use targeted metabolomics and natural variation in flavor-associated sugars, acids, and aroma volatiles to evaluate the chemistry of tomato fruits, creating a predictive and testable model of liking. This nontraditional approach provides novel insights into flavor chemistry, the interactions between taste and retronasal olfaction, and a paradigm for enhancing liking of natural products.

Surprisingly, how the olfactory system maintains identity of complex odors is unclear [6 – 10]. We took advantage of the plant-pollinator relationship between the Sacred Datura (Datura wrightii) and the moth Manduca sexta [11, 12] to determine how olfactory networks in this insect's brain represent odor mixtures. We combined gas chromatography and neural-ensemble recording in the moth's antennal lobe to examine population codes for the floral mixture and its fractionated components. Although the floral scent of D. wrightii comprises at least 60 compounds, only nine of those elicited robust neural responses. Behavioral experiments confirmed that these nine odorants mediate flower-foraging behaviors, but only as a mixture. Moreover, the mixture evoked equivalent foraging behaviors over a 1000 -fold range in dilution, suggesting a singular percept across this concentration range. Furthermore, neural-ensemble recordings in the moth's antennal lobe revealed that reliable encoding of the floral mixture is organized through synchronized activity distributed across a population of glomerular coding units, and this timing mechanism may bind the features of a complex stimulus into a coherent odor percept...|$|R

Following training these panelists underwent triangle test screening {{to determine whether}} or not they could detect the odorants used in this study. Following triangle testing, panelists underwent directional difference testing to determine if temperature affected odor perception when presented with two water samples. Following directional difference testing, panelists used FPA and evaluated water samples that contained odorants at either 25 oC or 45 oC. Samples containing geosmin cooled to 5 oC were also evaluated. Sensory analyses experiments indicate that <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> is a function of both aqueous concentration and water temperature for geosmin, MIB, nonadienal, n-hexanal, free chlorine, and 1 -butanol. The higher water temperature resulted in an increase in <b>odor</b> <b>intensity</b> for some, but not all, concentrations of geosmin, 2 -methylisoborneol, trans- 2, cis- 6 -nonadienal, n-hexanal, free chlorine, and 1 -butanol.

The strong fishy <b>odor</b> (FPA <b>intensity,</b> 8. 5) in Yinchuan {{was attributed to}} the abnormal growth of Dinobryon (cell density, 5. 7 x 10 (4) cells/mL), while the fishy odors in Hohhot, Zhengzhou, Jinan, and Dongying might be caused by Melosira and Cyclotella, Cryptomonas, Dinobryon, and Synedra, respectively. Unsaturated aldehydes, which {{have been reported to}} cause fishy odors, were not detected in all samples. However, some saturated aldehydes, including hexanal, heptanal, nonanal, decanal, and benzaldehyde, were detected with a total concentration range of 690 ng/L to 2166 ng/L, and might have partly contributed to the fishy odors. In addition, 2 -MIB (5. 77 - 21. 12 ng/L) and geosmin (2. 26 - 9. 73 ng/L) were responsible for the earthy/musty odors in the Yellow River source waters, and dimethyl disulfide (648. 2 ng/L) was responsible for the rancid/swampy <b>odor</b> (FPA <b>intensity,</b> 8. 0) episode in Yinchuan. This is a comprehensive study reporting on the occurrence and possible reasons for the odor issues in the Yellow River source water during winter. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Hyposmia {{is one of}} {{the early}} signs in Idiopathic Parkinson&# 180;s Disease (PD). Olfactory stimuli were applied during fMRI {{scanning}} to show disease-related modulation of central nervous system structures and to advance our understanding of olfactory dysfunction in PD patients. All participants received either unpleasant stimuli smelling like rotten eggs or pleasant ones smelling like roses. Using a block design at a 1. 5 T scanner we investigated a total of 8 PD patients (mean age 60 &# 177; 10. 9 years) and 13 age matched controls (mean age 58 &# 177; 9. 6 years). PD duration ranged from 1 to 9 years (mean 6. 63 years); patients had an average &# 8220;Unified Parkinson&# 8217;s Disease Rating Scale III&# 8221; score of 23. 25 (range, 6 - 46). Olfactory function was established using the &# 8220;Sniffin&# 8217; Sticks&# 8221; test battery. Patients tended to rate the stimuli presented during fMRI scans as less intense, but also as more pleasant than controls. FMRI results revealed differences between PD patients and controls which depended on the type of stimulation. While both pleasant and unpleasant stimulation was associated with lower activation in the amygdalo-hippocampal complex in patients compared to controls, increased activity in response to pleasant stimuli was observed in the striatum and the left inferior frontal gyrus. In contrast, unpleasant stimulation led to hypoactivation of the ventral striatum in patients (but not in controls) and did not enhance left inferior frontal activity. These results may partly reflect differences between PD patients and healthy controls in the processing of primary dimensions of <b>odors,</b> <b>intensity</b> and valence...|$|R
