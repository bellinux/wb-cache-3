40|$|This paper {{considers}} an {{auto parts}} supplier who receives <b>order</b> <b>release</b> updates from its customers and revises its production plan for future periods {{on a weekly}} basis. The inaccuracy of the <b>order</b> <b>releases</b> causes significant costs {{in the form of}} premium expedited transportation, production overtime, and excess inventory. This setting provides a rich context for studying <b>order</b> <b>release</b> variance, because the supply chain has adopted a just-in-time (JIT) approach where ideal inventory levels are kept at zero. This leads to a high reliance on <b>order</b> <b>release</b> accuracy in <b>order</b> to manage production quantities. This paper presents an optimization model that extends previous approaches focused on optimizing production plans to the JIT setting. Furthermore, based on real <b>order</b> <b>release</b> information provided to the supplier, two simple adjustment heuristic methods are developed. The performances of these approaches are compared with relying solely on <b>order</b> <b>releases</b> received from the customers. The simple median-based adjustment heuristic performs the best of all the approaches. Implications of the analysis are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Workload control (WLC) is a {{well-established}} production control concept for job shops that put primary emphasis on load-based <b>order</b> <b>release.</b> Recent advances in load-based <b>order</b> <b>release</b> research {{have led to}} an improved delivery performance at reduced shop floor workloads. But although <b>order</b> <b>release</b> is {{the primary focus of}} WLC research, it must be coupled with priority dispatching on the shop floor if order progress is to be regulated. Prior simulation research suggests that load-based <b>order</b> <b>release</b> methods should only be coupled with simple dispatching rules because other, more powerful rules can conflict with the functioning of the release method. Yet, recent empirical research suggests that powerful priority dispatching rules – such as due date-oriented dispatching rules – are in fact needed for a high level of delivery performance to be obtained in practice. This paper focuses on overcoming the conflict between <b>order</b> <b>release</b> and dispatching, so load-based <b>order</b> <b>release</b> can be combined with due date-oriented dispatching. Preliminary analysis reveals that part of the conflict is because existing due date-oriented dispatching rules overcompensate for schedule deviations that occur when <b>orders</b> are either <b>released</b> earlier or later than planned. Two alternative new dispatching rules based on an improved method of determining operation due dates are then developed to better account for schedule deviations and overcome the conflict with load-based <b>order</b> <b>release.</b> Further improvements in delivery performance are obtained, while the large workload reductions achieved by recently developed load-based <b>order</b> <b>release</b> methods are retained...|$|R
40|$|Production {{planning}} and control faces increasing uncertainty, dynamics and complexity. Autonomous control methods proved {{themselves as a}} promising approach for coping with these challenges. However, {{there is a lack}} of knowledge regarding the interaction between autonomous control and precedent functions of production {{planning and}} control. In particular, up to now previous research has paid no attention to the influence of <b>order</b> <b>release</b> methods on the efficiency of autonomous control methods. Thereby, many researchers over the last decades provided evidence that the <b>order</b> <b>release</b> function has great influence on the logistic objective achievement in conventional production systems. Therefore, this paper examines the influence of <b>order</b> <b>release</b> methods on the efficiency of autonomous control methods by both theoretic evaluation and discrete event simulation. The simulation results indicate an overall high influence. Moreover, the logistic performance differs considerably depending on the implemented <b>order</b> <b>release</b> methods and the combinations of <b>order</b> <b>release</b> methods with autonomous control methods. The findings highlight demand for further research in this field...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold: First, it aims at {{providing}} a link between <b>order</b> <b>release</b> mechanisms based on the workload control concept on the one hand and models for aggregate <b>order</b> <b>release</b> planning that optimize the aggregate material flow through a production unit on the other hand. We argue that both approaches aim at optimizing the material flow through a production unit, following a rule-based approach or an optimization-based approach, respectively. Secondly, it highlights the limitations of the models of the latter category that are available today and presents a direction for improvement. We argue that aggregate <b>order</b> <b>release</b> planning models should be based on models of the transient behaviour of queueing networks, and we present one way to accomplish this.

40|$|We {{consider}} an {{original equipment manufacturer}} (OEM) that outsources some of its production activities to a contract manufacturer that serves several customers on the same capacitated production line. The contract manufacturer {{is not willing to}} share all relevant information with the OEM, and therefore, a complex situation arises for the OEM to control the outsourced operations properly. In this paper, we discuss and compare the performance of three different <b>order</b> <b>release</b> strategies, which differ in the number of decision levels, such that the probabilistic behaviour of the contract manufacturer is (partly) incorporated and production plans are generated based on (deterministic) mathematical programming models. Simulation results show that an <b>order</b> <b>release</b> strategy with multiple decision levels performs significantly better than an <b>order</b> <b>release</b> strategy with only one decision level. We also discuss the conditions for a successful implementation of the more advanced <b>order</b> <b>release</b> strategy. Further, some ideas for future research are presented.

40|$|Every {{production}} planning concept that incorporates controlled <b>order</b> <b>release</b> will initially withhold jobs from the shop floor {{and create a}} pre-shop pool. <b>Order</b> <b>release</b> is {{a key component of}} the Workload Control concept that aims to maintain work-in-process within limits while ensuring due dates are met. <b>Order</b> <b>release</b> includes two decisions: (i) a sequencing decision that establishes the order in which jobs are considered for release; and, (ii) a selection decision that determines the criteria for choosing jobs for release. While selection has received much research attention, sequencing has been largely neglected. Using simulation, this study uncovers the potential for performance improvement in the sequencing decision and improves our understanding of how <b>order</b> <b>release</b> methods should be designed. Although most prior studies apply time-oriented sequencing rules and load-oriented selection rules, analysis reveals that load balancing considerations should also be incorporated in the sequencing decision. But an exclusive focus on load balancing is shown to increase mean tardiness and, paradoxically, require high workloads. A new sequencing rule is developed that only balances loads when multiple orders become urgent. It avoids high mean tardiness and allows the shop to operate at a low workload level. At the same time, the percentage tardy is reduced by up to 50 % compared to a purely time-oriented rule. The findings have implications not only for Workload Control but for any concept that features <b>order</b> <b>release</b> control, such as ConWIP and Drum-Buffer-Rope...|$|R
