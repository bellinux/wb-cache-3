500|$|After being {{released}} from his contractual obligations with Warner Bros. Records, Frank Zappa formed Zappa Records, a label distributed at that time by Phonogram Inc.. [...] He released the successful double album Sheik Yerbouti (1979, recorded 8/1977-2/1978), and began working {{on a series of}} songs for a follow-up album. The songs [...] "Joe's Garage" [...] and [...] "Catholic Girls" [...] were recorded with the intention that Zappa would release them as a single. Throughout the development of Joe's Garage, Zappa's band recorded lengthy jams which Zappa later formed into the album. [...] The album also continued the development of xenochrony, a technique Zappa also featured on <b>One</b> <b>Size</b> <b>Fits</b> <b>All</b> (1975), in which aspects of older live recordings were utilized to create new compositions by overdubbing them onto studio recordings, or alternatively, selecting a previously recorded solo and allowing drummer Vinnie Colaiuta to improvise a new drum performance, interacting with the previously recorded piece.|$|E
500|$|By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight labels were discontinued. In their place, Zappa and Cohen created DiscReet Records, also {{distributed}} by Warner Bros. Zappa continued {{a high rate}} of production through {{the first half of the}} 1970s, including the solo album Apostrophe (') (1974), which reached a career-high No.10 on the Billboard pop album charts helped by the chart single [...] "Don't Eat The Yellow Snow". Other albums from the period are Over-Nite Sensation (1973), which contained several future concert favorites, such as [...] "Dinah-Moe Humm" [...] and [...] "Montana", and the albums Roxy & Elsewhere (1974) and <b>One</b> <b>Size</b> <b>Fits</b> <b>All</b> (1975) which feature ever-changing versions of a band still called the Mothers, and are notable for the tight renditions of highly difficult jazz fusion songs in such pieces as [...] "Inca Roads", [...] "Echidna's Arf (Of You)" [...] and [...] "Be-Bop Tango (Of the Old Jazzmen's Church)". A live recording from 1974, You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2 (1988), captures [...] "the full spirit and excellence of the 1973–75 band". Zappa released Bongo Fury (1975), which featured a live recording at the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin from a tour the same year that reunited him with Captain Beefheart for a brief period. They later became estranged for a period of years, but were in contact at the end of Zappa's life.|$|E

Van Vliet now found himself stuck {{in a web of}} contractual hang-ups. At this point Zappa had begun to extend a helping hand, with Vliet already having performed incognito as [...] "Rollin' Red" [...] on Zappa's <b>One</b> <b>Size</b> <b>Fits</b> <b>All</b> (1975) and then joining with him on the Bongo Fury album and its later support tour. Two Vliet-penned numbers on the Bongo Fury album are [...] "Sam with the Showing Scalp Flat Top" [...] and [...] "Man with the Woman Head". The form, texture and imagery of this album's first track, [...] "Debra Kadabra", sung by Vliet, has 'angular similarities' to the work he would later produce in his next three albums. On the Bongo Fury album Vliet also sings [...] "Poofter's Froth Wyoming Plans Ahead", harmonizes on [...] "200 Years Old" [...] and [...] "Muffin Man", and plays harmonica and soprano saxophone.|$|E

The freer the new systems are from dogmatism and errors, the closer they approach the ideal, the more powerfully are these features manifested.
