5|$|Archibald Ashmore ("Archie") McKellar {{was born}} in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland on the 10 April 1912, the son <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>and</b> Margaret McKellar, of Bearsden, Dunbartonshire and was then educated at Shawlands Academy in the Southside of Glasgow. Upon leaving school he joined a local stockbroker's firm. This did not suit McKellar, who {{preferred}} an open–air life style. Keen to leave, but unsure of what direction to take in life, he joined his father's general contractor and construction business as a plasterer. He spent five years as an apprentice plasterer. During {{this time he was}} given no special privileges despite being the boss' son.|$|E
5|$|At the time, John was in {{south-east}} England recruiting mercenaries {{in preparation}} for his war with the barons. Rochester blocked the direct route to London, which was also held by the rebels. According to Roger of Wendover, the rebels at Rochester were led by William d'Aubigny, lord of Belvoir. Estimates {{of the size of}} Rochester's garrison vary, with the chroniclers' figures ranging from 95 to 140knights, supported by crossbowmen, sergeants, and others. Hearing the news that the city was in enemy hands, John immediately rode to Rochester and arrived on 13October. Royal forces had arrived ahead <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>and</b> entered the city on 11October, taking it by surprise and laying siege to the castle. Rochester bridge was pulled down to prevent the arrival of a relief force from London. The siege that followed was the largest in England up to that point, and would take nearly two months.|$|E
5|$|Civil {{war broke}} out in 1642 between the {{followers}} of King Charles I and those of Parliament. Initially, Captain Barnaby Burley, a relative <b>of</b> <b>John,</b> <b>and</b> an ardent Royalist, held the castle {{on behalf of the}} King with a tiny garrison. Burley negotiated surrender terms, including that he initially be allowed to remain in the castle with armed protection, and the castle remained in the control of Parliament {{for the rest of the}} war. Early during the Interregnum it was decided to increase the size of the garrison at the castle from 30 to 70 soldiers, due to concerns about a potential Royalist attack from the island of Jersey. Most of the soldiers lived outside the castle itself. The annual cost of this force was around £78 and in 1655 the garrison was made smaller again to reduce costs.|$|E

Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed.

John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years.|$|E
5|$|Humphrey Marshall {{was born}} in Orlean, Virginia in 1760. He was the son <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>and</b> Mary (Quisenberry) Marshall and {{apparently}} {{named in honor of}} his maternal grandfather, Humphrey Quisenberry. Marshall's father was a man of meager means despite being a member of a prominent Virginia family. Little is known of Marshall's early years, but one tradition holds that he had no formal education during his childhood and that his cousin Mary (later, his wife) taught him to read. Eventually, John sent Humphrey to live with his brother, Thomas Marshall, and to be educated by the same Scottish tutors that educated Thomas' children. Among Thomas' children (Humphrey's cousins) were John Marshall, future Chief Justice of the United States; James Markham Marshall, future federal judge; and Louis Marshall, a noted educator. In addition, one of Thomas' daughters, Nancy Marshall, married Joseph Hamilton Daveiss, a future U.S. Attorney. After receiving his education, Marshall became a surveyor.|$|E
5|$|Innocent consecrated Stephen Langton as {{archbishop}} against John's wishes, {{triggering a}} long {{dispute between the}} papacy and the King. The pope imposed various sanctions on England and John; at one point de Gray {{was one of only}} two bishops still legitimately holding office in England. In 1209 he became governor of Ireland for John, and spent until 1213 attempting to impose royal government on the Anglo-Norman barons and the native Irish in that country. Recalled to England to help defend against a threatened invasion by the French, de Gray then travelled to Rome to secure a papal pardon after the final settlement <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>and</b> Innocent's dispute over the bishop's abortive elevation to Canterbury. After securing his pardon de Gray was appointed Bishop of Durham, but he died {{on his way back to}} England.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of him until 1256, when {{he appears to have}} been sent to Rhodes; the reasons for this, i.e. whether this was to take charge of a {{military}} or administrative post or as an exile, are unknown. He appears again in 1258, when he participated in the coup launched by his elder brother Michael Palaiologos, then megas konostaulos, against the regent for the underage John IV Laskaris (r. 1258–1261), George Mouzalon. After Mouzalon's murder, Michael placed the young emperor under the protection <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>and</b> their half-brother Constantine. Michael quickly secured his own nomination as regent, and in turn appointed John as megas domestikos and sent him to command the Nicaean army in Macedonia, with Alexios Strategopoulos and John Raoul Petraliphas as subordinate commanders.|$|E
5|$|<b>Of</b> <b>John</b> <b>and</b> Susannah Sartain's children, Samuel (1830–1906), Henry (1833–1895), William Sartain (1843–1925) and Emily were {{painters}} and engravers, beginning {{a legacy of}} Sartain family artists and printmakers. Sartain sought her father's input on her work throughout her career and benefited from his support and connections. She carried on the mezzatint engraving technique that he taught her. Sartain lived with her parents into adulthood, supporting and caring for them in their later years. In 1886, her parents moved into her living quarters at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, Aruban police {{detained}} Nick John and Abraham Jones, former {{security guards}} {{from the nearby}} Allegro Hotel (which was then closed for renovation) on suspicion of murder and kidnapping. Authorities have never officially disclosed the reason for their arrests, but according to news accounts, statements made by Van der Sloot and Kalpoe {{may have been a}} factor in the arrests <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>and</b> Jones. Reports also indicated that the two former guards were known for cruising hotels to pick up women, and {{at least one of them}} had a prior incident with law enforcement. John and Jones were released on June 13 without being charged.|$|E

5|$|Stroheim wrote {{a highly}} {{detailed}} 300-page script that contained camera movements, composition and tint cues. Among {{the changes that}} he made to Norris's novel was giving McTeague the first name <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>and</b> omitting Norris's anti-Semitism. McTeague had been filmed once before as Life's Whirlpool, a five-reel short by William A. Brady's World Pictures, starring Broadway star Holbrook Blinn as McTeague, which had been released in 1916. Film critics disliked this version and Stroheim later criticized Blinn's performance. According to film historian Kevin Brownlow, Life's Whirlpool was also shot on location in Death Valley.|$|E
5|$|Stuart William Morgan is an English {{lorry driver}} and former heating {{engineer}} from Poole. One {{of five children}} <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>and</b> Julianne Morgan, {{he was raised in}} Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where his father was employed as a council foreman and his mother– a refugee from the former East Germany– worked as a school cleaner. Morgan left school with three CSEs, and in 1974 served a custodial sentence in borstal following a conviction for burglary. After attending Croydon Polytechnic to train as a plumber and heating engineer, he established a plumbing business in the Tunbridge Wells area. He moved to Dorset following the failure of that business in 1983 and worked as a heating engineer for Bournemouth Borough Council. He became a lorry driver in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The Third Epistle of John, often {{referred}} to as Third John and written 3 John, is the antepenultimate book of the New Testament and attributed to John the Evangelist, traditionally thought to be the author of the Gospel <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>and</b> the other two epistles of John. The Third Epistle of John is a private letter composed to a man named Gaius, recommending to him a group of Christians led by Demetrius, which had come to preach the gospel in the area where Gaius lived. The purpose of the letter is to encourage and strengthen Gaius, and to warn him against Diotrephes, who refuses to cooperate with the author of the letter.|$|E

5|$|The extant book {{contains}} preliminary matter, {{the complete}} {{text of the}} Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, and the Gospel of John through John 17:13. The remainder <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>and</b> an unknown amount of the preliminary matter is missing and was perhaps lost when the book was stolen early in the 11th century. The remaining preliminary matter consists of two fragmentary lists of Hebrew names contained in the Gospels, Breves causae (Gospel summaries), Argumenta (short biographies of the Evangelists), and Eusebian canon tables. It is probable that, like the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Books of Durrow and Armagh, part of the lost preliminary material included the letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus I beginning Novum opus, in which Jerome explains the purpose of his translation. It is also possible, though less likely, that the lost material included the letter of Eusebius to Carpianus, in which he explains {{the use of the}} canon tables. Of all the insular Gospels, only the Lindisfarne manuscript contains this letter.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Laura {{meets with}} Heather and Wendy, who hold a séance {{to try to}} contact Christine. When she returns to the hotel Laura informs John that Christine has said he is in danger and must leave Venice. John loses his temper with Laura, but that night they receive a {{telephone}} call informing them that their son (Nicholas Salter) has been injured in an accident at his boarding school. Laura departs for England, while John stays on to complete the restoration. Under the assumption that Laura is in England, John is shocked when later that day he spots her on a boat {{that is part of}} a funeral cortege, accompanied by the two sisters. Concerned about his wife's mental state and with reports of a serial killer at large in Venice, he reports Laura's disappearance to the police. The inspector (Renato Scarpa) investigating the killings is suspicious <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>and</b> has him followed.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{produced}} {{commentaries on}} most of the books of the Bible. His first commentary on Romans was published in 1540, and he planned to write commentaries on the entire New Testament. Six years passed before he wrote his second, a commentary on First Epistle to the Corinthians, but after that he devoted more attention to reaching his goal. Within four years he had published commentaries on all the Pauline epistles, and he also revised the commentary on Romans. He then {{turned his attention to the}} general epistles, dedicating them to Edward VI of England. By 1555 he had completed his work on the New Testament, finishing with the Acts and the Gospels (he omitted only the brief second and third Epistles <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>and</b> the Book of Revelation). For the Old Testament, he wrote commentaries on Isaiah, the books of the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and Joshua. The material for the commentaries often originated from lectures to students and ministers that he reworked for publication. From 1557 onwards, he could not find the time to continue this method, and he gave permission for his lectures to be published from stenographers' notes. These Praelectiones covered the minor prophets, Daniel, Jeremiah, Lamentations, and part of Ezekiel.|$|E
