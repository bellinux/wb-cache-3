40|$|We {{investigated}} the catabolism <b>of</b> putrescine (<b>Put)</b> in a non-transgenic (NT) and a transgenic cell line of poplar (Populus nigra × maximowiczii) expressing a mouse (Mus musculus) ornithine (Orn) decarboxylase (odc) cDNA. The transgenic cells produce 3 - to 4 -fold higher amounts <b>of</b> <b>Put</b> than the NT cells. The rate <b>of</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>Put</b> from the cells {{and the initial}} half-life <b>of</b> cellular <b>Put</b> were determined by feeding the cells with [U- 14 C]Orn and [1, 4 - 14 C]Put as precursors and following the loss of [14 C]Put in the cells at various times after transfer to label-free medium. The amount <b>of</b> <b>Put</b> converted into spermidine {{as well as the}} loss <b>of</b> <b>Put</b> per gram fresh weight were significantly higher in the transgenic cells than the NT cells. The initial half-life of exogenously supplied [14 C]Put was not significantly different in the two cell lines. The activity of diamine oxidase, the major enzyme involved in Put catabolism, was comparable in the two cell lines even though the <b>Put</b> content <b>of</b> the transgenic cells was severalfold higher than the NT cells. It is concluded that in poplar cells: (a) exogenously supplied Orn enters the cells and is rapidly converted into Put, (b) the rate <b>of</b> <b>Put</b> catabolism is proportional to the rate of its biosynthesis, and (c) the increased Put degradation occurs without significant changes in the activity of diamine oxidase...|$|R

40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae can utilize {{high quality}} (e. g. {{glutamine}} and ammonia) {{as well as}} low quality (e. g. γ-amino butyric acid and proline) nitrogen sources. The transcriptional activator Put 3 p allows yeast cells to utilize proline as a nitrogen source through expression <b>of</b> the <b>PUT</b> 1 and PUT 2 genes. Put 3 p activates high level transcription of these genes by binding proline directly. However, Put 3 p also responds to other lower quality nitrogen sources. As nitrogen quality decreases, Put 3 p exhibits an increase in phosphorylation concurrent {{with an increase in}} PUT gene expression. The proline-independent activation <b>of</b> the <b>PUT</b> genes requires both Put 3 p and the positively acting GATA factors, Gln 3 p and Gat 1 p. Conversely, the phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>Put</b> 3 p is not dependent on GATA factor activity. Here, we find that the mutation <b>of</b> <b>Put</b> 3 p at amino acid Tyr- 788 modulates the proline-independent activation <b>of</b> <b>PUT</b> 1 through Gat 1 p. The phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>Put</b> 3 p appears to influence the association of Gat 1 p, but not Gln 3 p, to the PUT 1 promoter. Combined, our findings suggest that this may represent a mechanism through which yeast cells rapidly adapt to use proline as a nitrogen source under nitrogen limiting conditions...|$|R
