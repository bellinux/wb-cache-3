Larvae develop primarily in animal manure and bacteria are essential for larval development; however, the principle of this dependence is not understood. We hypothesized that as the microbial community of animal manure changes over time, it {{plays an important role}} in stable fly fitness. Two-choice bioassays were conducted using 2 week old horse manure (control) and aging horse manure (fresh to 5 week old) to evaluate the effect of manure age on stable fly oviposition.

Stable fly larvae develop primarily in animal manure and live bacteria were shown to be essential for stable fly development. I hypothesized that the microbial community of horse manure changes over time and {{plays an important role in}} stable fly fitness. Two-choice bioassays were conducted using 2 week old horse manure (control) and aging horse manure (fresh to 5 week old) to evaluate the effect of manure age on stable fly oviposition.

Volatile compounds acting as oviposition stimulants/attractants and their specific bacterial origin remain to be determined.

Selected terrestrial microhabitats (n = 17) on a farm in northern Spain were sampled repeatedly over a year-long period and characterized for use by Culicoides species for immature development. Concurrent use of CDC light traps showed the presence of 37 species and 66, 575 specimens of adult Culicoides. A total of 28 species and 11, 396 individuals emerged from laboratory-maintained soil samples. Culicoides obsoletus and Culicoides scoticus (pooled as Obsoletus complex) were particularly abundant (comprising 58. 6 % and 74. 5 % of the total collections in light traps and emergence traps respectively). Potential key vectors of animal viruses (such as BTV) were found in two main terrestrial types of microhabitats. In the case of C. obsoletus, different types of <b>manure</b> (<b>old</b> and composted <b>manure,</b> manure mixed with organic matter, and fresh manure) produced most of the specimens. In contrast, larvae of C. scoticus and Culicoides lupicaris were associated with soil substantially comprised of rotting leaf litter that included the parasitic plant Lathraea clandestina. Several species, Culicoides festivipennis, Culicoides punctatus and Culicoides brunnicans, were very common in mud at pond margins. Indeed, pond microhabitats and runoff below barn rooflines supported the greatest species richness. In the pond habitat, 49. 4 % of Culicoides specimens emerged from mud at the water edge, as opposed to 50 cm above (32. 4 %) and 1 meter above waterline (18 %). Similar species richness, but statistically significant differences in abundance, were observed among the four pond microhabitats. Overall, the majority of the specimens were found in the upper layer (0 - 3 cm), except in manure, where they preferred deeper layers (> 6 cm). Maximum peaks of abundance occurred in both light traps and soil samples in summer months, whereas increased captures in autumn were noticed only in light traps. Both trapping systems failed to collect adult Culicoides midges in the coldest months of December, January and February. The literature on immature habitats of species suspected in BTV transmission in Europe, the Pulicaris group and particularly the Obsoletus group, is briefly reviewed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to, through {{temperature}} readings {{and evaluation of}} sowing, examine how materials containing more or less nitrogen generate heat in a hot bed. The method used to answer set questions {{has been carried out}} by gathering facts from literature, informants and digital resources, compiling this into a practical test with a hot bed containing six compartments with different materials. The materials being tested are fresh stable manure, garden waste, chicken manure, leaves, wool and <b>old</b> stable <b>manure,</b> where the hot bed with fresh manure is used as a reference. The {{temperature readings}} show that materials {{with a high level of}} nitrogen has a faster and higher heat generating capacity compared to materials with lower levels of nitrogen. It also show that these hot beds has a greater temperature loss when covered with soil. By the end of the test all hot beds, regardless previous temperature, has stabilized at 7 - 10 degrees Celsius. At this time germination has occurred in half of the examined hot beds; fresh manure, garden waste and wool. One week later, germination has occurred in all hot beds, with equivalent progress. This indicates that the alternative materials can be used instead of fresh stable manure to achieve a crop earlier than outdoor sowing. The temperature readings however show that neither of the hot beds work according to the gathered information. The temperature readings also show that the cooler hot beds to a large extent follow the outside temperature. The conclusion is by these parameters that the examined materials probably can be used as a component to fresh stable manure, but that the material per se, in the amount used in this test, are not potent enough to generate enough heat, had the outdoor climate been colder.

Larval cultures were performed once, to determine the species breakdown of the parasites. All producers were interviewed regarding herd management practices. The observed fecal egg counts were low in this study, with a range from 0 to 419 nematode eggs per 5 g of feces. The mean count was 9. 8 and the median was 1. Standard transformations failed to normalize the data, which followed an over-dispersed Poisson distribution. A zero inflated negative binomial model was applied to assess factors that would influence the fecal egg counts. Identified associations were: egg counts were lowest {{in the winter and}} highest in the late spring; first-lactation cattle had higher counts than <b>older</b> cows; if <b>manure</b> was spread mechanically on pastures used by lactating cattle the egg counts were higher; and if manure was spread on heifer-pastures, the adult cows had lower counts.

Six genera of fungi were isolated from carabao manure, namely; Penicillium, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Trichoderma and Rhizopus. Among these, only Trichoderma was selected as beneficial fungi. Fungal populations at different ages of carabao manure were observed, ranging from 6 - 26 x 10 6 cfu/g. Two species of Trichoderma (Trichoderma sp. 1 and Trichoderma sp. 2) were isolated and observed to be dominant on the 3 rd and 4 th week <b>old</b> carabao <b>manure.</b> Trichoderma sp. 2 grew best in rice bran and oatmeal substrates at 4 days of incubation period. The addition of combined Trichodema sp. 1 and Trichoderma sp. 2 on the compost (3 parts of rice straw and leaf litters: 1 part of carabao manure and 0. 5 part of carbonized rice hull) lessened the period of decomposition from 45 to 36 days as well as increase N, P and K content with 1. 49 % N; 0. 73 % P and 2. 28 % K. The C/N ratio of compost with introduced Trichoderma sp. was recorded at 8 : 1; O. M. at 20. 52 %; Organic carbon at 11. 93 %. Trichoderma sp. 2 was also found to have the potential use as bio-fertilizer on the growth and yield of pechay, particularly when it was combined with Trichoderma sp. 1 as the growth of pechay increased by 7. 10 cm with the mean of 23. 6 cm. Results further showed that the weight of pechay grown in soil with combined Trichoderma sp. 1 and Trichoderma sp. 2 was heaviest by 56 %.

40|$|Traditionally managed hay meadows of the Pennines {{are highly}} prized for their botanical diversity. In recent decades {{there has been}} a drastic {{reduction}} in these meadows because of the negative effects on botanical diversity of widespread management changes, such as the application of inorganic fertiliser and the switch from hay to silage production. The consequences of changes in grazing regime, cut date and inorganic fertiliser application have been well documented. However, although farmyard manure application {{is an integral part of}} long term meadow management it has as yet received less scientific attention. The application of farmyard manure provides a possible mechanism by which seed contained within hay cut from the meadows can subsequently be returned to the meadow. The dispersal of seed and establishment of plants within traditionally managed hay meadows is an important area of study because of the problems associated with attempts to re-create meadows in the Pennines and throughout the UK, an important goal of agri-environment schemes. Field, glasshouse and laboratory experiments are described which attempt to establish the viable seed content in samples of hay from botanically diverse meadows and how subsequent feeding to livestock affects the viable seed content of the farmyard manure produced. The experiments also explored the extent to which seed remained viable during the time that manure was stored prior to spreading, thus affecting its capacity to germinate once spread or to become incorporated into the soil seed bank. The spreading of farmyard manure has often been observed to create bare patches within the meadow vegetation. It was therefore hypothesised that these patches may be suitable niches for the germination of seeds from within the manure itself or from the soil seed bank, and this was investigated using field experimentation. Comparison of the original vegetation with the viable seed content of hay, manure and dung from cattle fed exclusively on meadow hay from two traditionally managed sources produced some interesting results. The meadow vegetation contained a range of prominent perennial herbs such as Geranium sylvaticum, Sanguisorba officinalis and Filipendula ulmaria which are considered to be important from a conservation management viewpoint. However, germination of the seed within the hay cut from these meadows failed to provide any evidence for the occurrence of such species within the hay. Either the typical mid July hay cut comes before these species produce ripe seed or the seed was lost from the hay during the turning and baling operations. Viable seeds of the early flowering annual herb Rhinanthus minor, which is also considered by ecologists to be desirable, were also absent from the hay. The most abundant species in the hay were generally grasses, with Poa trivialis especially prominent, and less important, often annual, herb species. The feeding of this hay to cattle and subsequent germination of seed within the dung showed that the digestive system of the cattle was extremely damaging to seed viability. Proportionally P. trivialis became even more dominant within the dung samples with many of the less common species in the hay failing to have any viable seed within the dung. In contrast to the dung, the fresh manure collected from the two farms contained a larger quantity of seed, and more species than the dung. These samples were in fact more comparable to the hay samples in terms of species composition although not quantity. This suggests that the majority of the viable seed which is incorporated into manure does not pass through the digestive tract of the livestock, but rather falls directly from feed racks onto the barn floor. Confirmation of the negative effect of the digestive processes of cattle on seed viability was achieved in a laboratory experiment. A three stage process was used to mimic the effects of chewing, rumen digestion and post ruminal digestion. Five species were tested; two grasses P. trivlalis and Anthoxanthum odoratum which occurred within the hay samples, the annual herb Myosotis arvensis which was found within hay samples and two perennial herbs F. ulmaria and S. officinalis which were absent from the hay samples. Whilst the effects of chewing and ruminal digestion varied between the five species tested the post ruminal digestion was extremely damaging in all five species. These results suggested that the prominence of P. trivialis in dung samples was due more to the high quantity of seed within the hay rather than to any increased ability to survive digestion. The perennial herbs, F. ulmaria and S. officinalis were able to survive digestion at least as well as P. trivialis and so given appropriate management of hay cut timing could become incorporated into manure for subsequent dispersal via this route. By comparing the viable seed content of fresh" manure with that in samples stored for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months it was clear that the seed content of the manure did not reduce until it had been stored for a period longer than 6 months. Once again those species with the greatest quantity of seed in fresh manure were the ones which were able to survive within the <b>older</b> <b>manure</b> samples. The burial in manure of known quantities of the same seeds as used in the laboratory digestion experiment confirmed this result, and also showed that herb species absent from the hay and manure are at least as capable of survival within manure heaps as species such as P. trivialis which dominated the manure samples collected from farms. In order to assess the role that manure application to meadows may have in supplying seed to the soil seed bank, soil cores were extracted from the meadows at the two farms used in the study and the seed content estimated by seed germination. The soil seed bank contained all of the species found within the manure samples as well as a range of earlier flowering species including the annual herb R. minor. Again the longer lived perennial herb species valued from a bio-diversity perspective were largely absent from the soil seed bank or only present in very low quantities. The species make up of the seed bank within these diverse hay meadow communities was found to be more akin to the species make up of species poor pasture communities. This suggests that seed set by many of the ecologically desirable species is not a regular occurrence within Pennine meadows. The large quantity of seed of certain species found within manure applied to the meadows means that it could play a significant role in the build up of seed within the soil seed bank, although these species may be expected to be recruited to the soil seed bank via other routes such as seed rain during the period of crop growth and the hay making operations. Field experimentation with observation of the colonisation of gaps created by farmyard manure application showed that vegetation colonising these gaps did not compare to the seed content of the manure or the soil seed bank, but rather the surrounding vegetation. Colonisation of these gaps did not give rise to vegetation containing a higher quantity of species indicative of the manure or soil seed content. Perennial herb species absent from both the manure and the soil seed bank were amongst the colonisers of the these gaps suggesting that vegetative re-growth is an important process in the maintenance of long term botanical diversity within such meadows. Whilst it remains possible that during years when the hay cut is later than usual, seed production and subsequent incorporation into the hay of more desirable later flowering herbs could occur, the overwhelming weight of evidence suggests that the farmyard manure from cattle fed meadow hay is not a significant contributor to the dispersal of ecologically valuable components of meadow vegetation.
