5|$|The {{essential}} elements of the coronation have remained largely unchanged for the past thousand years. The sovereign is first presented to, and acclaimed by, the people. He or she then swears an oath to uphold {{the law and the}} Church. Following that, the monarch is anointed with holy oil, invested with regalia, and crowned, before receiving the homage of his or her subjects. Wives of kings are then anointed and crowned as queen consort. The service ends with a closing procession, and since the 20th century it has been traditional for the royal family to appear later <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>of</b> Buckingham Palace, before attending a banquet there.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece {{of the woman who}} lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>of</b> 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E

25|$|There was {{a single}} witness to these events, a young man taking the air <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>of</b> the Zarate family {{residence}} nearby. This man {{was thought to be}} Pedro de Zarate. He called to his slaves, and together with them he went to investigate the incident. When they arrived, they found the victim dead and the assailants gone. And they discovered that the victim was in fact Viceroy López de Zúñiga y Velasco, apparently returning from a late-night tryst. Zarate was the son of one of the judges of the Audiencia of Lima, and this court was assembled to decide what action to take. The decision was made to move the body to the viceregal palace, and to announce that the viceroy had died of a sudden attack of apoplexy.|$|E

500|$|Commenting on the film's {{final scene}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>of</b> Buckingham Palace, Andrew Roberts has written, [...] "The scene is fairly absurd from a {{historical}} {{point of view}} – Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill were not present {{and there were no}} cheering crowds outside Buckingham Palace." [...] Overall, Roberts praises the film as a sympathetic portrayal of the King's [...] "quiet, unassuming heroism", and he states: [...] "The portrayals by Firth and Bonham Carter are sympathetic and acute, and the movie’s occasional factual bêtises should not detract from that." ...|$|E
500|$|Media {{and public}} {{reaction}} to the marriage was negative and cynical. Some commentators believed Jackson was marrying a person he did not love, and Rowe was having a baby {{who may not have}} been biologically Jackson's. The Daily Mirror, a British tabloid newspaper, published a photograph of Rowe <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>of</b> an Australian hotel. In it, she is seen holding her head in her hands. One Jackson biographer stated that the woman's dismayed and exasperated pose was most probably due to the excessive presence of paparazzi below. The Daily Mirror, however, ran the photograph while mockingly proclaiming, [...] "Oh, God! I've Just Married Michael Jackson." ...|$|E
500|$|The bier and the pall {{spread over}} it are tilted towards the viewer with the lion {{supporting}} the head standing [...] shorter, increasing {{the visibility of}} the effigy, especially the head. The gilded-bronze, life-size effigy itself makes no attempt to argue for Cossa's papal status, dressing Cossa clearly in the costume of a cardinal; the bedding it rests on is of un-gilt bronze. [...] The opening in the 16th century of the sarcophagus confirmed that Cossa's actual burial clothes matched the effigy. There was no precedent for a three-dimensional gilded-bronze effigy on an Italian tomb monument; there was, however, a [...] gilt bronze statue <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>of</b> the Palazzo della Briada in Bologna commissioned by Pope Boniface VIII.|$|E

Or perhaps they had already heard rumours of the strange visitor who had come to Venice, although, however fast such news may fly, this seemed scarcely probable. At the least there they were, men and women, talking earnestly together, and about them the three Englishmen noted a strange thing.|$|R
