40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} chemical signals derived from different sources—urine of feral cats (Felis catus) and urine from <b>overcrowded</b> mice (Mus musculus) on regulation of oestrous cycles in Mus musculus musculus under laboratory conditions. Cat urine and urine from mice housed in <b>overcrowded</b> conditions caused very similar effects. Application of urine from feral cats and from <b>overcrowded</b> conspecifics to the bedding of experimental animals {{for a period of}} 21 days caused a significant increase in numbers of animals with extended oestrous cycles. Application of cat urine or <b>overcrowded</b> mouse urine to the bedding of female mice caused an extension of oestrous cycles in 56. 0 % and 62. 5 % of tested animals, respectively. The {{results of the present study}} and other experimental data from our laboratory may indicate that predator urine and urine from <b>overcrowded</b> conspecifics share the same chemical information...|$|R

5|$|Students in the {{residential}} school system were faced with a multitude of abuses from teachers and administrators, including sexual and physical assault. They suffered from malnourishment and harsh discipline {{that would not have}} been tolerated in any other school system. Corporal punishment was often justified by a belief that it was the only way to save souls, civilize the savage, or punish and deter runaways – whose injuries or death sustained in their efforts to return home would become the legal responsibility of the school. <b>Overcrowding,</b> poor sanitation, inadequate heating, and a lack of medical care led to high rates of influenza and tuberculosis; in one school, the death rate reached 69%. Federal policies that tied funding to enrollment numbers led to sick children being enrolled in order to boost numbers, thus introducing and spreading disease. The problem of unhealthy children was further exacerbated by the conditions of the schools themselves – <b>overcrowding</b> and poor ventilation, water quality and sewage systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{school was}} {{designed}} to accommodate 1,524 pupils of both sexes; however, by 1898 {{the growth of the}} Noel Park estate led to severe <b>overcrowding</b> problems, with an average attendance of 1,803, making it the most overcrowded school in the School Board's area.
