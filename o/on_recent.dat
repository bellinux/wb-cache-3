5|$|Borrowing {{from the}} French again, Planché {{introduced}} the revue (or review) to British theatre, as a commentary <b>on</b> <b>recent</b> events, particularly {{events in the}} theatre. His first revue, Success; or, a hit if you like it, was produced in 1825. He wrote another seven over the next 30 years, a peak of four in the years 1853–1855.|$|E
5|$|In neuroscience, {{long-term}} potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of synapses based <b>on</b> <b>recent</b> patterns of activity. These are patterns of synaptic activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two neurons. The opposite of LTP is long-term depression, which produces a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength.|$|E

5|$|Although Cooper {{voted in}} favor of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, he opposed {{escalating}} U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia. He questioned Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale. On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations. Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to brief the full Senate <b>on</b> <b>recent</b> developments in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Although officially {{designated}} a tropical cyclone by the NHC, Météo-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual {{report to the}} World Meteorological Organization that Grace {{should not have been}} classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60mph (95km/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, Météo-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC of warning upon this system based <b>on</b> <b>recent</b> trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.|$|E

5|$|Based <b>on</b> <b>recent</b> DNA-analysis, {{the genus}} Ploceus is almost {{certainly}} polyphyletic. If all species currently included in the genus would remain and the genus would be made monophyletic, {{it would have to}} encompass the entire subfamily Ploceinae. The Ploceinae can be divided into two groups. In the first group, the widowbirds and bishops (genus Euplectes) are sister to a clade in which the genera Foudia and Quelea are closest relatives and which further includes the Asiatic species of Ploceus, i.e. P. manyar, P. philippinus, P. benghalensis, P. megarhynchus, (and P. hypoxanthus, although untested). Since Georges Cuvier picked P. philippinus as the type species, these five species would logically remain assigned to the genus Ploceus.|$|E
5|$|Hibernian {{are one of}} {{only two}} {{full-time}} professional football clubs in Edinburgh, which is the capital of and second largest city in Scotland. The club had the fourth largest average attendance in the Scottish leagues during the 2016–17 season, with 15,394. This was a significant increase <b>on</b> <b>recent</b> seasons, inspired by the Scottish Cup victory in 2016. In the period after the Second World War, Hibs attracted average attendances in excess of 20,000, peaking at 31,567 in the 1951–52 season. Since Easter Road was redeveloped into an all-seater stadium in the mid-1990s, average attendance has varied between a high of 15,394 in 2016–17 and a low of 9,150 in 2003–04. In the 1980s and 1990s, a minority of the club's supporters had {{a reputation as one of}} Britain's most prominent casuals groups, known as the Capital City Service.|$|E
5|$|In the {{official}} records of another Bronze Age empire, {{that of the}} Hittites in Anatolia, various references from c. 1400 BC to 1220 BC mention a country named Ahhiyawa. Recent scholarship, based on textual evidence, new interpretations of the Hittite inscriptions, as well as <b>on</b> <b>recent</b> surveys of archaeological evidence about Mycenaean-Anatolian contacts during this period, concludes that the term Ahhiyawa must {{have been used in}} reference to the Mycenaean world (land of the Achaeans), or at least to a part of it. This term may have also had broader connotations in some texts, possibly referring to all regions settled by Mycenaeans or regions under direct Mycenaean political control. Another similar ethnonym Ekwesh in twelfth century BC Egyptian inscriptions, has been commonly identified with the Ahhiyawans. These Ekwesh were mentioned as a group of the Sea People.|$|E
