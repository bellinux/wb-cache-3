5|$|By 1770, Sabrina {{began to}} {{question}} Day's techniques and {{to complain about the}} chores she had to perform. In December, the propriety of Day's arrangement with Sabrina was questioned by the local community, especially Anna Seward. Edgeworth joined Day for Christmas at Stowe, and convinced him that his experiment had been unsuccessful. He also persuaded Day that Sabrina was too old to live with him without a chaperone. Day appeared to accept Edgeworth's point of view, as he paid for Sabrina to attend Sutton Coldfield boarding school in Warwickshire early in 1771. She remained at the boarding school for three years, including weekends and holidays, with infrequent visits from Day. The school normally focused on preparing high society daughters for marriage, with subjects such as needlework and the arts. Day stipulated that she was to be taught academic subjects but should not dance <b>or</b> <b>learn</b> music.|$|E

5000|$|Informal {{learning}} is any learning {{that is not}} formal <b>learning</b> <b>or</b> non-formal <b>learning,</b> such as self-directed <b>learning</b> <b>or</b> <b>learning</b> from experience. Informal {{learning is}} organized differently than formal and non-formal learning because it has no set objective in terms of learning outcomes and is never intentional from the learner’s standpoint. For all learners this includes heuristic language building, socialization, enculturation, and play. Informal learning is a pervasive ongoing phenomenon of <b>learning</b> via participation <b>or</b> <b>learning</b> via knowledge creation, {{in contrast with the}} traditional view of teacher-centered learning via knowledge acquisition.|$|R
25|$|With a gendered {{data mining}} system in place, feminist historians {{have little to}} no hope of {{integrating}} their findings with the internet.

25|$|Child {{slavery is}} also {{considered}} a contemporary form of slavery, although its does come with debate {{as to what}} constitutes child slavery. However, child prostitution is widely considered a form of slavery in which children, mostly from South East Asia, South Asia, and Latin America, “are sold by their parents either because they are destitute, have too many mouths to feed, or are simply greedy”. On the other hand, in some cases of child prostitution, when parents give their children up to traffickers, they are deceived into believing that their child will earn good money, get an education, <b>or</b> <b>learn</b> a trade.|$|E

[...] Series creator Chris Carter on the other hand claimed the episode {{was one of the most}} popular first-season episodes and thought the teaser and the scene with Mulder meeting Deep Throat at a shark tank were memorable.

500|$|While one set {{of critics}} and bloggers used the UCLA study to dismiss the {{argument}} raised in Carr's essay, another set took {{a closer look at}} the conclusions that could be drawn from the study concerning the effects of Internet usage. Among the reflections concerning the possible interpretations of the UCLA study were whether greater breadth of brain activity while using the Internet in comparison with reading a book improved or impaired the quality of a reading session; and whether the decision-making and complex reasoning skills that are apparently involved in Internet search, according to the study, suggest a high quality of thought or simply the use of puzzle solving skills. Thomas Claburn, in InformationWeek, observed that the study's findings regarding the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage were inconclusive and stated that [...] "it will take time before it's clear whether we should mourn the old ways, celebrate the new, <b>or</b> <b>learn</b> to stop worrying and love the Net".|$|E
500|$|... "Although {{the right}} of silence, in {{contrast}} to the right to counsel, can be exercised passively (by not speaking), a suspect’s initial reticence does not inherently convey to a reasonable police officer that the suspect wishes to exercise a right to silence and terminate the interview.

500|$|In {{addition}} to Karofsky's newly revealed sexual orientation, {{other aspects of}} his personality have been explored. In [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", when the football team is forced {{to spend a week}} working with the glee club that Karofsky and other members have been bullying, the [...] "softer side" [...] of his personality is seen, especially when he's performing with the club. After the club's director surprises him with a compliment on his performing, Karofsky is the one who suggests that the team perform an extra musical number for the halftime show they are preparing for, though he comes up with a rationale that makes it sound like a necessity to keep up their social status rather than something he particularly wants to do. Adler said, [...] "I feel like that it did make him happy and, obviously, he has some natural abilities that Mr. Schuester was able to spot. I don't think he's ever allowed himself to do that ever in his life, to dance <b>or</b> <b>learn</b> a song, especially to do that in public. ...Doing that was such an obstacle to overcome." [...] In [...] "Furt" [...] and [...] "Born This Way", it is revealed that he had been kind, a cub scout, and an [...] "A" [...] student. However, his behavior had changed for the worse in the former episode before returning to the good in the latter. Although the anti-bullying club formed by Karofsky and Santana in [...] "Born This Way" [...] is created with ulterior motives in mind, Karofsky subsequently makes a tearful apology to Kurt in [...] "Prom Queen", and then insists that Kurt wait for his safety escort after the next class period.|$|E
