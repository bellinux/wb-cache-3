50|$|Wellington town {{belt and}} <b>Outer</b> <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> {{is a pair}} of strips of tree-filled {{wilderness}} spaces near and around central Wellington, New Zealand's capital city. The inner strip, the town belt, is an elongated U-shape. It was set aside by the city's founders in 1840. It is now about two-thirds of its original area. Portions have been used for purposes like Wellington's Public Hospital and Wellington Botanic Garden.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} growth limits is reoccurring within city theory. If city growth is constrained, then denser {{development}} patterns must be used. Contemporary theory on city form is centred on arguments for more sustainable cities, so methods of densification must be sustainable. Very little {{work in the}} field of architecture or urban design has been done to investigate the potential of defining the edge to the city through built form. None has been found that translates the edge of a green-belted city into a built form. Therefore, this thesis suggests that in some cases, defining the edge of a green-belted city through built form is a logical step to take in the evolution of these cities. The greenbelt is a widely used tool in cities around the world and has been implemented in various ways. In order to produce a site-specific response to the edge condition created by greenbelt and city, the design is located in Wellington. Wellington is highlighted as an unusual case for the relationship between city and greenbelt for two reasons. The first is that the Wellington <b>Outer</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Belt,</b> formally established in 2004, has grown from a public desire to have a continuous network of recreational tracks running the length of {{the western edge of the}} city and protecting the highly valued visual amenity of ridgelines and hilltops. This is opposed to cities which have implemented greenbelts primarily to constrict growth. The second, closely connected to the first, is that the greenbelt boundary has largely been influenced by topographical constraints on settlement patterns and is not an arbitrary planning gesture. Wellington is also unusual because of the inclusion of a town belt in the original colonial layout of the city in 1841. The belt has survived largely intact, and can provide insight into the nature of city growth up against a green edge. This thesis aims to draw together two aspects of city form; the relationship between greenbelt and city and the understanding that denser, intensified settlement patterns provide a more ecological form and therefore poses the hypothesis that defining the edge of the city through intensification can contribute to an ecological city form...|$|E

40|$|A <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> is {{a zone of}} {{land around}} the city where {{building}} development is severely restricted. Although London's <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> {{has a history of}} being effective in achieving its purposes, recently planners have started debating how it could be reformed. The <b>green</b> <b>belt's</b> reformers propose renewing the <b>green</b> <b>belt's</b> function. However no recent research has shown the current distribution of London's <b>green</b> <b>belt.</b> The aim of this research is to explore which factors influence the functions of London's <b>green</b> <b>belt.</b> We first investigate the history of the <b>green</b> <b>belt's</b> functions.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Green</b> <b>belt</b> is {{a useful}} method to {{management}} growth of a city. It aims to prevent cities from growth irregularly, protect open spaces, provide recreational and educational space and prevent historic towns from urbanization. <b>Green</b> <b>belt</b> policy {{has been used to}} deal with the environment problems and nature conservation issues. Scotland {{has a long history of}} setting out <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> policy and putting it into practice successfully. This paper focus on comparing the <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> policy differences between Scotland and China based on history and planning system angles. The results of this study indicate that there are several problems during the process of setting and carrying out <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> policy in China. And it suggests that the <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> policy will be much more efficient by reducing planning procedures and increasing participation of local public...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Green</b> <b>belt</b> concept {{grew out}} of the English Garden City {{movement}} of the nineteenth century. Although the thoughts and theory were widespread throughout {{the first half of the}} twentieth century, it was not until 1959 that <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> policy became legislative reality. The initial result was the London Green Belt: other <b>green</b> <b>belts</b> around major cities followed The predominant objective of the <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> at that time was to restrict urban sprawl, and the concept was initially well supported by citizens, planners and the Biitish government. The British government attaches great importance to <b>green</b> <b>belts,</b> which have been an essential element of planning policy for some four decades. The purposes of <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> policy and the related development control policies set out in 1955 remain valid today with remarkably little alteration. This sophisticated and comprehensive approach provided a model that many other cities around the world have since followed. Christchurch for example inherited its planning legacy from the British experience. Although first defined in 1954 as a 'non-settlement area', (meaning the same thing) it was not until the 1980 's that the term 'green belt' was formally used in New Zealand statutory planning documents Since then (particularly in the later 1990 's) there has been speculation that the <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> philosophy has begun to fade The <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> containment policy was designed to thwart urban spread but has instead led to piecemeal development. Essentially, this has led to a rethink of the <b>green</b> <b>belt.</b> There is some speculation that the codification of <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> policy that originated in 1955 in London is not applicable to the city of Christchurch. Furthermore, new legislation by the way of the Resource Management Act has altered the philosophies of land-use planning and encouraged a new way of thinking. This new thinking is based on sustainable management objectives and has been responsible for much of the <b>green</b> <b>belt's</b> recent decline. No longer can a single land-use tool restrict development in such a large area without considering other potential uses, while simultaneously juggling it with the sustainable management principle. Accordingly it has raised questions as to whether the Christchurch <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> concept is worth keeping, and if not, what other means are available to help continue to promote the <b>green</b> <b>belt</b> objectives that were first introduced many decades ago...|$|R

40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>Belt</b> {{policies}} {{have helped to}} create chaotic landscapes at the rural–urban interfaces of the United Kingdom's largest cities.
