5|$|Bigfin reef squids and {{the common}} <b>octopus</b> (<b>Octopus</b> <b>vulgaris)</b> were studied to resolve a century-long debate over whether {{cephalopods}} can hear. Unlike fishes, cephalopods do not possess air-filled swim bladders, which might amplify sound waves travelling in water. The results were published in 2009. It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear best at a frequency of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Octopuses</b> (<b>Octopus</b> <b>vulgaris)</b> landed from {{commercial}} fishing were sampled and {{the concentrations of}} lead, calcium and strontium, in digestive gland, branchial heart, gills, mantle and arms, were determined using PIXE (particle-induced X-ray emission). Lead was detected in all tissues, although not in samples from all animals analysed. Female <b>octopuses</b> accumulated more lead in digestive gland than did males. The digestive gland index, an indicator of nutritional status, showed a negative correlation with lead concentration in both sexes. There were positive correlations between the concentration of lead and those of calcium and strontium in digestive gland and a negative correlation between lead and calcium in branchial heart tissue. Concentrations of calcium in arms were lower in autumn and spring than in winter and summer. Lead content increased with increasing body weight and mantle length so we can conclude that lead continues to accumulate during the animal’s life. Concentrations of lead in two samples were higher than the maximum legally permitted concentration of lead in food. peerreviewe...|$|R
40|$|The DNA barcoding proposes {{the use of}} a {{particular}} sequence from a single genomic region as the base for an identifying system capable to determine all animal species. This methodology comprises the analysis of a 655 base-pair region from the mithocondrial cytochrome C oxidase gene (COI). Its application in the species identification of fishery products has been very promising. However, in the last years some doubts about its usage have emerged. In this work, we make use of the DNA barcoding for the identification of some of the <b>octopus</b> species with higher commercial interest (<b>Octopus</b> membranaceus, <b>Octopus</b> <b>vulgaris,</b> <b>Octopus</b> aegina, <b>Octopus</b> cyanea) focusing the attention on the reliability and completeness of the available information on the databases.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{occurrence}} of diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs) and their producing phytoplankton species in southern Brazil, {{as well as the}} potential for toxin accumulation in co-occurring mussels (Perna perna) and <b>octopuses</b> (<b>Octopus</b> <b>vulgaris).</b> During the spring in 2012 and 2013, cells of Dinophysis acuminata complex were always present, sometimes at relatively high abundances (max. 1143 cells L− 1), likely the main source of okadaic acid (OA) in the plankton (max. 34 ng L− 1). Dinophysis caudata occurred at lower cell densities in 2013 when the lipophilic toxins pectenotoxin- 2 (PTX- 2) and PTX- 2 seco acid were detected in plankton and mussel samples. Here, we report {{for the first time the}} accumulation of DSTs in <b>octopuses,</b> probably linked to the consumption of contaminated bivalves. Perna perna mussels were consistently contaminated with different DSTs (max. 42 µg kg− 1), and all <b>octopuses</b> analyzed (n = 5) accumulated OA in different organs/tissues: digestive glands (DGs) > arms > gills > kidneys > stomach + intestine. Additionally, similar concentrations of 7 -O-palmytoyl OA and 7 -O-palmytoly dinophysistoxin- 1 (DTX- 1) were frequently detected in the hepatopancreas of P. perna and DGs of O. <b>vulgaris.</b> Therefore, <b>octopuses</b> can be considered a potential vector of DSTs to both humans and top predators such as marine mammals...|$|R
5|$|Quite common {{within its}} small range, the {{sluggish}} and reclusive puffadder shyshark {{is often seen}} lying still on the sea floor. It is gregarious and several individuals may rest together. A generalist predator with grasping dentition, the puffadder shyshark is known to take a variety of small benthic prey: crustaceans (including crabs, shrimp, crayfish, mantis shrimp, and hermit crabs), annelid worms (including polychaetes), bony fishes (including anchovies, jack macherels, and gobies), cephalopods (including squid), and fish offal. Overall, the most important component of this shark's diet is crustaceans, followed by polychaetes and then fishes. Males seem to prefer polychaetes, while females prefer crustaceans.

40|$|<b>Octopuses</b> {{have large}} brains and exhibit complex behaviors, but {{relatively}} {{little is known}} about their cognitive abilities. Here we present data from a five-level learning and problem-solving experiment. Seven <b>octopuses</b> (<b>Octopus</b> <b>vulgaris)</b> were first trained to open an L shaped container to retrieve food (level 0). After learning the initial task all animals followed the same experimental protocol, first they had to retrieve this L shaped container, presented at the same orientation, through a tight fitting hole in a clear Perspex partition (level 1). This required the <b>octopuses</b> to perform both pull and release or push actions. After reaching criterion the animals advanced to the next stage of the test, which would be a different consistent orientation of the object (level 2) {{at the start of the}} trial, an opaque barrier (level 3) or a random orientation of the object (level 4). All <b>octopuses</b> were successful in reaching criterion in all levels of the task. At the onset of each new level the performance of the animals dropped, shown as an increase in working times. However, they adapted quickly so that overall working times were not significantly different between levels. Our findings indicate that <b>octopuses</b> show behavioral flexibility by quickly adapting to a change in a task. This can be compared to tests in other species where subjects had to conduct actions comprised of a set of motor actions that cannot be understood by a simple learning rule alone...|$|R

40|$|In southeastern Brazil, slipper {{lobsters}} (Scyllarides deceptor and S. brasiliensis) are caught by fleets trawling for pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis and F. paulensis) and pots-and-traps fishing for <b>octopuses</b> (<b>Octopus</b> <b>vulgaris).</b> Eight hundred fifty-six landings of shrimp trawlers and 28 of the <b>octopus</b> fleet were monitored in the Santos region from May 2006 to April 2007. Additional {{analysis was performed}} using a database covering the period from 1999 onwards. This study seeks to identify the recent patterns of exploitation of these lobsters {{with the goal of}} improving the way towards fishery sustainability. Scyllarides deceptor was the dominant lobster species with 1032 specimens collected, while only three specimens of S. brasiliensis were identified. The area known as the `Farol do Boi` (23 degrees 01 `S, 45 degrees 00 `W to 25 degrees 00 `S, 45 degrees 40 `W at 60 - 135 m deep) showed the highest Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE). A General Linearized Model (GLM) was used to investigate the factors influencing variations in CPUE in trawl fleets and led to the conclusion that year, month and depth were the most important factors. We detected a significant decrease in the relative abundance of lobsters in the fishing zone despite relatively low fishing effort. Recommendations to protect the lobster resources include taking special precautions in the natural refuge area of the `Farol do Boi`, as an exclusion zone for trawl fleets, and controlling the use of traps longlines to catch <b>octopuses.</b> Concerns about depensatory processes due to the over-exploitation of lobster populations around the world are raised.

40|$|Failure {{mode and}} effect {{analysis}} (FMEA) model was applied {{in conjunction with}} cause-and-effect analysis for the risk assessment of <b>octopus</b> processing (<b>Octopus</b> <b>vulgaris).</b> Critical control points were identified and implemented in the cause-and-effect diagram (also known as Ishikawa, tree diagram and fishbone diagram).

Following the application of corrective actions, a second calculation of RPN values was carried out, leading to considerably lower values (below the upper acceptable limit of 130).

40|$|Abstract Some marine molluscs, notably sea hares, cuttlefish, squid, and <b>octopus,</b> release ink when {{attacked}} by predators. The sea hare Aplysia californica releases secretions from the ink gland and opaline gland that protect individuals from {{injury or death}} from predatory spiny lobsters {{through a combination of}} mechanisms that include chemical deterrence, sensory disruption, and phagomimicry. The latter two mechanisms are facilitated by millimolar concentrations of free amino acids (FAA) in sea hare ink and opaline, which stimulate the chemosensory systems of predators, ultimately leading to escape by sea hares. We hypothesize that other inking molluscs use sensory disruption and/or phagomimicry as a chemical defense. To investigate this, we examined concentrations of 21 FAA and ammonium in the defensive secretions of nine species of inking molluscs: three sea hares (Aplysia californica, Aplysia dactylomela, Aplysia juliana) and six cephalopods (cuttlefish: Sepia officinalis; squid: Loligo pealei, Lolliguncula brevis, Dosidicus gigas; octopus: <b>Octopus</b> <b>vulgaris,</b> <b>Octopus</b> bimaculoides).

40|$|Globally, <b>octopus</b> larviculture {{is one of}} the {{challenges}} faced in the attempt to diversify aquaculture and achieve cephalopod farming. Currently, only juveniles of <b>Octopus</b> <b>vulgaris,</b> <b>Octopus</b> joubini, and Enteroctopus dofleini have been obtained at an experimental level.

The morphometric measurements varied exponentially over time and did not show different tendencies before and after settlement. Mantle growth in relation to total length fit a logarithmic regression, whereas arm length and eye diameter increased linearly with respect to total length throughout the entire paralarval and juvenile periods. This suggests that the size of the mantle decreases with age in proportion to the total <b>octopus</b> length, whereas the organs more directly involved in catching prey tend to increase in direct proportion to the total length.
