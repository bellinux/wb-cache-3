50|$|Platypus cylindrus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>oak</b> <b>pinhole</b> <b>borer,</b> is a species of ambrosia beetle in the weevil family Curculionidae. The adults and larvae burrow under the bark of mature oak trees. It is native to Europe.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>oak</b> <b>pinhole</b> <b>borer</b> {{is between}} 6 and 8 mm long, being {{cylindrical}} In cross section (hence cylindrus) and, seen from above, {{shaped like a}} long, narrow rectangle. Its colour is very deep brown to black. The larvae are yellowish-white, legless grubs.|$|E
50|$|The most virulent {{cork oak}} {{pathogen}} may be Diplodia corticola, a sac fungus which causes sap-bleeding sunken canker wounds in the wood, withering of the leaves, and lesions on the acorns. The fungus Biscogniauxia mediterranea {{is becoming more}} common in cork oak forests. Its fruiting bodies appear as charcoal-black cankers. Both of these fungi are transmitted by the <b>oak</b> <b>pinhole</b> <b>borer</b> (Platypus cylindrus), a species of weevil.|$|E
50|$|Platypus australis, {{commonly}} known as the polyphagous <b>pinhole</b> <b>borer,</b> is a species of ambrosia beetle in the weevil family Curculionidae found in Australia. It only eats superficial layers of wood, hence the damage is trivial.|$|R
50|$|The New Zealand <b>Pinhole</b> <b>Borer</b> beetle is {{technically}} a wood boring beetle but its pheromones more closely resemble bark beetles because it retains an aggression pheromone, allowing the Platypus apicalis to cause large scale mortality to their hosts. This chemical {{is produced in}} their hind gut.|$|R
50|$|Platypodinae is a weevil {{subfamily}} in {{the family}} Curculionidae. They are important early decomposers of dead woody plant material in wet tropics; all but two species are ambrosia beetles that cultivate fungi in tunnels excavated in dead wood as the sole food for their larvae. They are sometimes known as <b>pinhole</b> <b>borers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The tunnels {{made by the}} <b>oak</b> <b>pinhole</b> <b>borer</b> {{are about}} 1.6 mm in {{diameter}} and do not weaken the timber to any great extent. However, they do spoil the appearance of veneers, and the ambrosia fungus produces black staining. The beetles and larvae continue their tunnelling activities in stacked timber, and although at first they only burrow through the sapwood, later they {{move on to the}} heartwood. Insecticides have no effect on adults and larvae inside their tunnels, but kiln drying of the timber can kill them when the fungus is unable to survive the dessication.|$|E
50|$|The <b>oak</b> <b>pinhole</b> <b>borer</b> infests mature trees, favouring stressed, dying or dead {{standing}} trees, fallen {{trees and}} logs; the insects choose a sick or moribund tree, but their activities do not kill trees. Besides oak trees, they can infest other hardwood trees, including beech, sweet chestnut, ash, elm and walnut. The adults can mature {{at any time}} of year but are at their most active from July to September. At this time of year, the male excavates a hole a few centimetres deep. The female goes inside and then emerges, with mating taking place {{on the surface of the}} bark. The female then re-enters the hole and the male follows. The female extends the tunnel further, working radially, and the male pushes the wood fragments out, leaving a pile of frass. This residue is fine and soft which distinguishes it from the more granular, coarser material produced by most wood-boring beetles. The walls of the gallery soon become covered with a layer of ambrosia fungi, spores having been introduced on the body surface of the beetles. This symbiotic fungus is only found in the galleries made by ambrosia beetles and provides them and their larvae with nourishment; they do not feed on the wood.|$|E
40|$|A 10 -year {{study of}} the effect of wind damage on the health of {{residual}} Nothofagus fusca (Hook, f.) Oerst. / N. menziesii (Hook, f.) Oerst. (red/silver beech) forest showed tree mortality continued throughout the period in severely damaged forest. Forest with less than 30 % canopy loss was much less affected by continued deterioration and showed little difference from undamaged forest {{at the end of the}} period. The two species showed different trends in mortality over time; the mortality rate of red beech levelled off after 7 years while that of silver beech was still increasing after 10 years. Platypus spp. <b>pinhole</b> <b>borers</b> were not a primary cause of tree mortality, attack being largely confined to trees that were already unhealthy. Blowdown debris harboured only a single generation of <b>pinhole</b> <b>borers,</b> decay being too advanced to support further broods...|$|R
5000|$|The timber is white, soft, {{and easily}} worked, with {{interlocked}} grain and coarse texture, showing {{a tendency to}} picking-up during planing. It is not durable and prone to termite, <b>pinhole</b> <b>borer</b> and marine borer attacks. Heartwood is straw-coloured with a pink or green tint, becoming reddish-brown on exposure. Freshly-cut wood has an unpleasant odour.|$|R
50|$|The <b>oak</b> <b>pinhole</b> beetle is {{native to}} Europe. It used to be {{considered}} rare in Britain, but after the Great Storm of 1987, when many trees were blown down in southern England, it {{took advantage of the}} abundant supply of timber and became much more common.|$|R
40|$|In a mixed {{stand of}} pole-sized red beech and silver beech, {{pathological}} wood (a defective core) {{was present in}} 92 % of the red and 68 % of the silver beech sampled. <b>Pinhole</b> <b>borer</b> (Platypus spp.) attack had invariably {{led to the formation}} of pathological wood in both species, and in red beech, an additional type of pathological wood often not associated with Platypus holes or other wounds, was present in at least 22 % of the trees. All stem rots were associated with pathological wood...|$|R
40|$|Forest dieback is {{a complex}} area of study {{that has led to}} the {{development}} of a number of theories or models which purport to explain it. These models are examined using the example of kamahi dieback in Tongariro National Park, There has long been concern over the health of kamahi in the Park and it is thought kamahi could be in a state of decline. A survey on three transects in the area of the Park where dieback is most apparent compared kamahi health to possible predisposing, triggering and hastening factors (the decline-disease theory of forest dieback) to determine their role in any dieback. Possums, <b>pinhole</b> <b>borer,</b> and Sporothrix fungus were highlighted in literature as likely triggering factors in kamahi dieback; an experiment examined their role: possums were excluded from trees, <b>pinhole</b> <b>borer</b> attack simulated, and healthy trees infected with Sporothrix, while unhealthy trees were treated with fungicide. To assess the effect of canopy health and vertebrate browsers on regeneration (regeneration is important in both the cohort senescence theory and the model of stand succession), another experiment was conducted using open and exclosure plots under healthy and thinning canopies. A second survey assessed the overall health of kamahi in the area, and compared site and tree factors to levels of dieback. The survey of an area with high apparent dieback found 14 % of kamahi stems were dead. There was some evidence that age predisposed stems to dieback, and Sporothrix was identified as accelerating stem death; no causal factor was determined. The experiment found no evidence that possums, <b>pinhole</b> <b>borer,</b> or Sporothrix were affecting the health of kamahi at this site. Sites under a thinning canopy in the regeneration study were much more variable in composition than sites under the healthy canopy; while sites in exclosure plots had higher densities of seedlings than sites that browsers had access to. Sites covered by the broad-scale survey contained very few unhealthy or dead kamahi trees, and none of the factors studied seemed to be impacting on the health of kamahi. There were more small (between 50 cm and 2 m) saplings present at sites with more dead kamahi trees. It was concluded that kamahi in Tongariro National Park is generally in a healthy state, and not undergoing decline; although localised dieback may be very high. Possums, <b>pinhole</b> <b>borer</b> and Sporothrix are not having a large effect on kamahi health in this area. Vertebrate browsers may be maintaining regeneration at a level below natural. Comparison between the theories of dieback, succession and the kamahi data indicate that the successional model may best explain the pattern of kamahi dieback. The models of dieback and succession can be inserted into an overriding model of dieback management, which will indicate the best path for investigating forest dieback...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} species of weevils, bark beetles and <b>pinhole</b> <b>borers</b> (Curculionidea) of the world fauna is {{estimated}} on a miscellaneous, because the weevils are explored not with identical completeness {{in different parts of}} the world. Entomologists regularly discover and describe new species of weevils. Estimation of {{number of species}} of Curculionidae has grown from 30 000 (Endrödi 1961) to 50 000 (Kippenberg 1981). Hoffman (1950) even considered Curculionidae as the greatest family of animals. This opinion is supported also by newer data (Alonso-Zarazaga, Lyal 1999). According to this data in the world live about 500 000 species of weevils only about every tenth of which is described (Lyal, Kin...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Mortality {{of forest}} and scrub species from most deltas of the Lake Te Anau {{shoreline}} is described following unnaturally prolonged flooding during 1975. Despite a {{high incidence of}} <b>pinhole</b> <b>borer</b> in the affected beech trees there is conclusive evidence that the mortality in most species was due to prolonged high water tables that exceeded the tolerances of many important shoreline species. Differential mortality in Leptospermum scoparium (manuka) apparently depended on whether or not plants were totally submerged for substantial periods-their root systems appear to be tolerant of indefinite flooding. The results have substantiated previous predictions on submergence tolerance of species from lake-shore forest and scrub communities. These tolerance values had been derived by indirect methods and form the basis of the high-level operational guidelines for use of the lake waters for hydro-electric generation...|$|R
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{generally}} forages in {{the branches}} and foliage of trees, in small groups of up to seven birds. Occasionally larger flocks of up to 30 individuals have been reported, and the species has been encountered in a mixed-species foraging flock with the little friarbird (Philemon citreogularis). The bulk of their diet consists of insects, including cockroaches, termites, grasshoppers, bugs such as lerps, scale (Coccidae) and shield bugs (Pentatomidae), beetles such as bark beetles, chafers (subfamily Melolonthinae), click beetles (genus Xanthophaea), darkling beetles (genera Chalcopteroides and Homotrysis), leaf beetles (genus Paropsis), ladybirds of the genus Scymnus, weevils such as the <b>pinhole</b> <b>borer</b> (Platypus australis), {{and members of the}} genera Mandalotus, Polyphrades and Prypnus, as well as flies, moths, bees, ants and spiders. Birds have been reported preying on small lizards. Prey are caught mostly by sallying, although birds also probe and glean. In Kakadu National Park, birds prefer to hunt prey between the leaf bases of the screw palm Pandanus spiralis.|$|R
50|$|Detarium senegalense {{trees are}} {{propagated}} by stones {{which are often}} distributed by elephants and chimpanzees who consume the fruits (elephants and chimpanzees in Senegambia?). Germination occurs 6-10 weeks after propagation, though the germination rate is typically low. Although tallow trees are leguminous, they do not fix significant amounts of nitrogen. The Detarium senegalense tree has two phases of fructification. Trees generally lose their leaves {{at the beginning of}} March and experience a renewal of leaves a few weeks later. After young leaves have developed, flowering occurs. As the fruits ripen, they develop a sweeter flavour and increased vitamin C content. Fruits reach full maturation from August-November depending on the climate of the region they are growing in. Trees are drought tolerant and have the ability to grow on infertile sites as they are relatively insensitive to soil, altitude, heat, and humidity. Their wood has good resistance to termites, <b>pinhole</b> <b>borers,</b> and marine bores; however, the wood is susceptible to Lyctus attack.|$|R

40|$|Following {{damage to}} saw-logs in Argyllshire forests methods of {{controlling}} {{attack by the}} ambrosia (<b>pinhole</b> <b>borer)</b> beetle Trypodendron linea tum (Oliv.) have been studied. Attack begins in April, reaches a peak in May but then declines rapidly, being of negligible importance after August. Trees felled between November and January are more susceptible but few logs left at stump are attacked. Damage is much more widespread in logs stacked in the forest or at the mill. Good protection can be provided economically by spraying stacked timber with an emulsion of 0 · 75 per cent. gamma BHe. A fresh treatment is advisable if logs are restacked or the outside ones removed from a stack between April and August. These treatments, combined with rapid extraction and conversion of logs during the summer, should {{reduce the incidence of}} damage. Suspension of felling during this period appears unjustified if these measures are followed; moreover, freshly felled timber is less susceptible to attack. Although the Lymt:xylid beetle Hylecoetus dermestoides L. is also widespread, damage is less apparent due to the absence of associated staining. The control measures recommended for Trypodendron appear suitable for Hylecoetus...|$|R
5000|$|The habitat {{preference}} {{of this species}} is predominantly dead beech wood forest, including Red Beech, Silver Beech and Black beech. Platypus apicalis appear in dead tissues surrounding trees and larvae. Few fungi are related to <b>pinhole</b> <b>borer</b> closely, they benefit beetles in different ways. Ambrosia fungi provide food that they depend on. Pathogenic fungi which can infect or even kill live tree is carried by insects. The beetle has no preference for hard or soft wood as it resides inside the Beech trees and some Eucalyptus species. The Platypus resides in the dead wood of the tree but when numbers grow due to sufficient breeding material, healthy trees are threatened by their invasion. They are considered pests at times to native forests but only when they threaten healthy trees. Their main pest area is the forestry plantations where they colonise and render some high quality timber useless due to imperfections and colour change in the timber.Their nests {{are more likely to}} kill the part of living tree. The beetles commonly colonise along the North Island, South Island and Chatham Island, however, has not spotted in some eastern forests such as Balmoral and Eyrewell State forests, Canterbury ...|$|R
40|$|Catastrophic tree {{mortality}} {{is a natural}} process in beech (Nothofagus spp.) forest ecology. Managers must accept that periodically large areas of forest will die, accompanied by outbreaks of insects and disease. In accepting the inevitability of these changes, managers also need to recognise an educational responsibility to forest users in offering {{an explanation of the}} processes occurring and their probable consequences. It is well known that small disturbances in beech forest usually initiate change over much greater areas, especially in mature or overmature stands. Forest managers can take action to reduce the impact of new tracks, camp sites, and picnic areas and retain healthy forest cover. <b>Pinhole</b> <b>borers</b> (Platypus spp.) are the primary agents in extending damage, and action to reduce populations and prevent their build-up can be very effective. Cleared trees and logs should be cut into short lengths to dry and become unsuitable for attack. Residual trees should not be stressed by root or stem damage or have spoil heaped on their roots. Trees that subsequently do become attacked should be felled and also cut into short lengths before brood emerge, i. e., within 2 years of attack. Care in planning tracks and camp sites and in the treatment of adjacent trees {{can go a long way}} towards preserving the essential character of the area. Conversely, the development of high populations of Platypus spp. can lead to prolonged and extensive stand decline...|$|R
40|$|Information on {{the life}} cycle and {{associations}} of the mountain <b>pinhole</b> <b>borer,</b> Platypus subgranosus Schedl (Coleoptera : Curculionidae : Platypodinae) is reviewed. Existing unpublished data combined with data collected {{in this study are}} used to provide quantitative descriptions of aspects of P. subgranosus biology. The within-tree spatial pattern of attack was found to be highly aggregated both at high and low density of attack. Aggregation was very high around host tissue infected with the pathogenic fungus Chalara australis Walker and Kile. A minimum spacing between pinholes of approximately one centimetre was indicated but densities were not sufficiently high for this to result in spatial regularity. Use of larval head capsule width and body length in a non-hierarchical classification procedure confirmed the presence of five instars. Initial oviposition occurred when the gallery ranged between 5 and 25 cm in length. The natality rate at initial oviposition was roughly one egg per centimetre beyond an initial length of 4 cm. Initial oviposition in galleries established in the late summer/autumn period occurred at roughly the same date irrespective of establishment date. This was paralleled by a faster rate of gallery development for autumn compared to late summer establishment. Timing of emergence exhibited an analogous trend to that of initial oviposition. It is postulated that these trends as well as a trend for emergence and subsequent gallery establishment to occur less commonly in spring/early summer than late summer/autumn are a response to high mortality of eggs and early instars in summer from desiccation. For a sample of galleries established in the late summer/autumn period, initial oviposition occurred in winter one to eight months after gallery establishment with eggs usually laid in a batch with median size of seven. First to third instars appeared through the following spring and early summer with fourth and fmal instars appearing in summer and subsequently the fmal instar predominating through winter until pupation in the following spring. Emergence began in early summer. A new model of insect phenology based on conditional probabilities is developed and compared to existing ordinal regression and gamma entry time models. The sex ratio of emergents over the population is very close to unity but individual galleries can deviate markedly from this with an excess of either sex. The mean number of emergents per gallery was 19. 7 with a maximum of 92. The gallery failure rate was 8...|$|R
