5|$|Although the edibility of S.amygdalinus is {{not known}} with certainty, {{authorities}} often recommend to avoid consuming blue-staining, red-pored boletes, as several are poisonous. The species was implicated in <b>one</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> poisonings in California in 1996–97, {{but because of the}} nature of the symptoms experienced, there was probably more than one type of mushroom consumed.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{may also}} be planted {{outdoors}} in regions with suitable climates. Concern for water conservation in arid regions {{has led to the}} promotion of gardens requiring less watering (xeriscaping). For example, in California, the East Bay Municipal Utility District sponsored the publication of a book on plants and landscapes for summer-dry climates. Cacti are <b>one</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> drought-resistant plants recommended for dry landscape gardening.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors made escape {{attempts}} daunting for the internees. They would have to navigate through Japanese-occupied territory, find food, and as few internees spoke Cantonese, they {{would also have to}} deal with the language barrier if they succeeded in escaping. Despite these difficulties, there were three major escape attempts, of which two in March 1942 were successful. <b>One</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> eight internees escaped on a small boat to neighbouring Macau. Another group, consisting of two internees, escaped through the New Territories and into mainland China. The third group, four policemen, in April 1942 managed to escape the camp grounds but were caught within a few miles of camp. They were subsequently imprisoned and released back to camp after a few weeks.|$|E

They burned Cox's farm at Warstock and looted and attacked the home of a Mr. Taverner. When they reached Kingswood, Warwickshire, they burned the Dissenting chapel and its manse.

5|$|Hentoff {{was known}} as a civil libertarian, free speech activist, anti-death penalty advocate, and anti-abortion advocate. He {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the State of Israel. Hentoff espoused generally liberal views on domestic policy and civil liberties, but in the 1980s, he began articulating more socially conservative positions—opposition to abortion, voluntary euthanasia, and the selective medical treatment of severely disabled infants. Hentoff argued that a consistent life ethic should be the viewpoint of a genuine civil libertarian, arguing that all human rights are at risk when the rights of any <b>one</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> people are diminished, that human rights are interconnected, and people deny others' human rights at their peril.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, a labour strike {{erupted in}} the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in Madras. This strike was led by V. Kalyanasundara Mudaliar, {{a leader of the}} Indian National Congress. The strike lasted for over six months during which around 10,000 workers struck work. A {{crackdown}} was ordered. Eventually, two factions emerged; <b>one</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> workers desired to return to work while another wished to continue the strike. Violent riots broke out when striking workers prevented the others from returning to work. The riots began to assume communal colours as the workers who wished to continue the strike were mostly caste Hindus while those who desired to end it were largely untouchables or Dalits.|$|E

As the message spread across Texas, settlers left their homes and assembled in Gonzales, where Colonel James Fannin was due to arrive with the remaining Texian Army troops. On February 27 <b>one</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> reinforcements impatiently set out on their own; as a result 32 additional Texians entered the Alamo. Research by historian Thomas Ricks Lindley indicates that an additional 50 or 60 men reinforced the Alamo on March 4.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Corregidor prisoners, before first {{entering}} the camp, had each hidden {{a piece of}} a radio under their clothing, to later be reassembled into a working device. When the Japanese had an American radio technician fix their radios, he stole parts. The prisoners thus had several radios to listen to newscasts on radio stations as far away as San Francisco, allowing the POWs to hear about the status of the war. A smuggled camera was used to document the camp's living conditions. Prisoners also constructed weapons and smuggled ammunition into the camp for the possibility of securing a handgun.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> temnospondyls, the Branchiosauridae, is {{also known}} from larval specimens. Branchiosaurids like Branchiosaurus and Apateon are {{represented}} by many fossils preserving skin and external gills. An entire growth series is exhibited in {{the wide range of}} sizes among specimens, but the lack of terrestrially adapted adult forms suggests that these temnospondyls were neotenic. Unlike other temnospondyls, their postcranial skeletons developed quickly but were still partly cartilaginous when fully mature. Adults likely had an aquatic lifestyle similar to juveniles. Recently, large specimens of Apateon gracilis were described with adaptations toward a terrestrial lifestyle, indicating that not all branchiosaurs were neotenic.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day {{a large number}} of people staged protests near Jantar Mantar, New Delhi. There were minor clashes between some groups of protesters and the police; the police then removed some protesters from the area. <b>One</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> protesters also observed a one-day hunger strike at Jantar Mantar. All roads leading to India Gate were closed by police and areas where protesters had gathered during the previous week were out of bounds to the public. Some of the protesters drew graffiti and slogans on papers spread on the road, condemning the incident and demanding stricter laws and speedy judgement. The BJP renewed its demand for a special parliament session to discuss the case and to adopt stricter laws on crime against women.|$|E
