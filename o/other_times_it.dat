5|$|The word kosher is {{also part}} of some common product names. Sometimes it is used as an {{abbreviation}} of koshering, meaning the process for making something kosher; for example, kosher salt is a form of salt with irregularly shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to the rules of kashrut, because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more effectively. At <b>other</b> <b>times</b> <b>it</b> is used as a synonym for Jewish tradition; for example, a kosher dill pickle is simply a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, using a generous addition of garlic to the brine, and is not necessarily compliant with the traditional Jewish food laws.|$|E

Some schools offer no {{sex education}}, since it remains a controversial issue in several countries, particularly the United States (especially with regard to the age at which children should start receiving such education, the amount of detail that is revealed, including LGBT sex education, and topics dealing with human sexual behavior, e.g. safe sex practices, masturbation, premarital sex, and sexual ethics).|$|E
25|$|The hyphens {{and lack}} of {{projection}} lines indicate prosodic dependencies.

A given clitic is often prosodically dependent on its syntactic dependent (He'll, There's) or on its head (would've). At <b>other</b> <b>times,</b> <b>it</b> can depend prosodically on a word that is neither its head nor its immediate dependent (Florida's).|$|E

25|$|A {{change of}} metre in Plautus often accompanies the exit or {{entrance}} of a character, and thus frames a scene. At <b>other</b> <b>times</b> <b>it</b> indicates {{a change of}} pace, such as when Amphitruo's slave Sosia suddenly changes from iambic octonarii to a more excited cretic metre when he begins to describe a battle. In Terence different metres accompany different characters: for example, in each of Terence's plays, the woman loved by a young man uses iambic septenarii; in the Heauton Timorumenos, Eunuchus, and Phormio, {{one of the two}} young men is associated with trochaics, the other with iambics. Thus there can be frequent changes of metre within a single scene.|$|E
25|$|If the {{flashing}} body {{is set on}} fire and rushes violently to the Earth it is called a thunderbolt; if it is only half of fire, but violent also and massive, it is called a meteor; if it is entirely free from fire, it is called a smoking bolt. They are all called 'swooping bolts' because they swoop down upon the Earth. Lightning is sometimes smoky, and is then called 'smoldering lightning"; sometimes it darts quickly along, and is then said to be vivid. At <b>other</b> <b>times,</b> <b>it</b> travels in crooked lines, and is called forked lightning. When it swoops down upon some object it is called 'swooping lightning'.|$|E
25|$|Mercurial, clever, {{and always}} {{a few steps}} ahead of his enemies, at times {{he could be a}} calculating schemer who would not only {{manipulate}} people for the greater good but act like a bumbling fool to have others underestimate his true abilities. Sometimes this appears simply as a joke, such as in The Tomb of the Cybermen, where he finishes the archaeologists' calculations behind their backs, but at <b>other</b> <b>times,</b> <b>it</b> seems much darker. In The Evil of the Daleks he coldly manipulates Jamie into trying to rescue Victoria (thus setting in motion the Human Factor tests) and is unsympathetic when Edward Waterfield tries to apologise for his collaboration with the Daleks. Despite the bluster and tendency to panic when events got out of control, the Second Doctor always acted heroically and morally in his desire to help the oppressed.|$|E

25|$|When a {{practical}} effect cannot be accomplished, the crew turns to Entity FX to create digital imagery {{for a given}} scene. Sometimes this imagery is to substitute action sequences that they cannot do on-site, and <b>other</b> <b>times</b> <b>it</b> is used to create subtle foreground or background effects. For instance, a matte painting is used to establish the Metropolis background, which is composed of buildings from several modern-day cities in addition to Vancouver; they include Singapore and Hong Kong among others. For the scene where Clark rips his shirt open in the phone booth, revealing the tattoo, visual effects {{were added to the}} tattoo illuminating it. But in order to add the effects, the middle pane of glass was removed from the phone booth so that the special effects team had a clear line to Welling’s chest; they re-added the middle pane digitally, adding reflections so that it looked natural.|$|E
25|$|Spirit-Eater (Grim Tuesday, Drowned Wednesday, Sir Thursday) — a {{creature}} made by sorceries and a seed item {{belonging to the}} person whose physical form it assumes, being designed to imitate them.

The mold originates from the (fictional) planet called Avraxyn; its mutant form, present in Spirit-Eaters, is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact between and only between the Spirit-Eater and natural beings, wherein after it communicates knowledge of its model to the former. A Spirit-Eater's true form varies and can only be seen through a veil of raindrops on a sunny day. At all <b>other</b> <b>times,</b> <b>it</b> resembles its model.

25|$|Externally, {{the most}} obvious feeding {{structure}} of the mosquito is the proboscis. More specifically, the visible part of the proboscis is the labium, which forms the sheath enclosing {{the rest of the}} mouthparts. When the mosquito first lands on a potential host, its mouthparts will be enclosed entirely in this sheath, and it will touch the tip of the labium to the skin in various places. Sometimes, it will begin to bite almost straight away, while <b>other</b> <b>times,</b> <b>it</b> will prod around, apparently looking for a suitable place. Occasionally, it will wander for a considerable time, and eventually fly away without biting. Presumably, this probing is a search for a place with easily accessible blood vessels, but the exact mechanism is not known. It is known that there are two taste receptors {{at the tip of the}} labium which may well play a role.|$|E
