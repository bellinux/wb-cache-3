Danny brought in some old demo tapes, I'm talking twelve years old, back when 'Down With the Sickness' and 'Stupify' , and all that stuff was written, this was actually written before that." [...] The songs that Wengren was referring to were [...] "Perfect Insanity", and [...] "Divide". The band also recorded a version of the song [...] "Midlife Crisis", which was originally performed by Faith No More. Draiman comments, [...] "We took the song, revamped it and modernized it to our current level, and the version's killer." [...] However, the song did not make it into the final track listing of the album, and is instead featured on Covered, A Revolution in Sound. This version of [...] "Midlife Crisis" [...] later appeared on The Lost Children, the band's first compilation album.|$|E
2500|$|Today many {{multiple}} pregnancies are {{the result}} of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and [...]08% quadruplets). Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made {{to reduce the risk of}} multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> <b>That</b> way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.|$|E

The investigators concluded that there were no deaths resulting from stolen equipment. And the doctor who provided Amnesty International with the number of babies killed dropped from 312 to 72 and then 30, 19 of which died before the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. After the war, The New York Times wrote, [...] "It's plainly wrong for a member of congress to collaborate with a public relations firm to produce knowingly deceptive testimony on an important issue.

2500|$|For example, if {{a patron}} {{requests}} [...] "a good book," [...] the readers' advisor might ask {{the reader to}} describe a book they have enjoyed. [...] The focus of the conversation is not on recitation of plot, but on the aforementioned appeal elements (i.e. pace, subject, tone, writing style, etc.). [...] In our example, the patron tells the readers' advisor of a humorous mystery novel with a sharp-tongued female protagonist. [...] Our readers' advisor also learns that the patron prefers fast-paced dialogue to excessive descriptive passages. [...] Once the appeal elements have been identified (i.e. a humorous mystery featuring snappy dialogue and a female protagonist), the readers' advisor will suggest appropriate titles in the collection by drawing on personal knowledge and/or by consulting appropriate print and online resources. [...] Even though the patron requested a mystery, a skilled readers advisor will often offer a suggestion <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>that</b> point the reader to new a new vista outside of a mentioned genre or milieu.|$|E

Long-time Washington Post columnist Colman McCarthy said, [...] "He was a reporter who didn't worry about being objective. He worried about what he would choose to write. I'm always amused when they call somebody 'one-sided'. Seldes offered one side – the side you weren't getting elsewhere". Nader said of Seldes, [...] "He was like a doctor. He reported about disease in the political economy, and the gross inequities of power, and the abuses and the exploitation. I {{always wanted to be a}} crusading lawyer, and he gave me some materials to contemplate crusading about." [...] Journalist Nat Hentoff said, [...] "He took what should be the most honorable term in journalism – muckraking – and made it work again.

[...] He said the game was a bit too difficult, with very challenging puzzles. A Next Generation similarly said that the puzzles were generally more frustrating than in other LucasArts games, citing as an example a door puzzle for which the clues [...] "are so confusingly drawn" [...] that the player ultimately must use trial and error. GameSpot's Jeffrey Adam Young agreed, saying of the puzzles, [...] "some follow logic, others just call for trial and error, and yet others will leave you clueless". A reviewer for Maximum disagreed, saying that [...] "with the exception of one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>that</b> were just too obscure, [...] set at just the right level to keep a serious adventure freak riveted (and not too hacked off)." [...] Joshua Roberts of Allgame praised the puzzles, saying there were [...] "only a few real brain twisters" [...] and that most could be solved with patience and consideration. [...] Bernard H. Yee of PC Magazine said that some of the puzzles were [...] "a bit more frustrating than others".|$|E

2500|$|In {{his works}} on the Missale Speciale, Stevenson {{addressed}} {{the relationship between the}} presence of specific watermarked paper and the date of printing, and developed the principle of [...] "runs and remnants". Many bibliographers had argued that the fact that a watermark in a book whose date is in question also appears in a book with a specific date gives no indication (other than a terminal date) for the printing of the undated book because the printer of the dated book could have used old paper which he or someone else had held for many years. Stevenson observed that, while an individual might hold on to a supply of writing paper for a number of years, a printer, for whom the cost of paper for books was his largest capital investment, would ordinarily use paper soon after it was purchased. In fact, [...] "As a rule a particular lot of paper seems to have been obtained and set out for a particular job." [...] Where there is a run of paper with a specific watermark, as opposed to an isolated sheet <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> <b>that</b> should indicate that the book was printed shortly after the paper was manufactured and purchased. In contrast, the presence of a single or few sheets with a particular watermark (a [...] "remnant") might reflect an older paper used, and not be indicative of the actual printing date of a book. Stevenson confirmed this principle by identifying numerous examples of the same watermarks in the Missale Speciale in other dated or datable incunables, the deteriorating states of which fit the chronology of the known dates of the books.|$|E
