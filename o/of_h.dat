30|$|The {{regulation}} <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 3 a and RFT 1 transcriptions involving multiple flowering pathways under SD and LD {{conditions have}} been reported (Greenup et al. 2009). In the OsGI-Hd 1 -Hd 3 a pathway, OsGI, similar to the Arabidopsis flowering time gene GIGANTA (GI), acts as a positive regulator upstream <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 1 under both LD and SD conditions (Hayama et al. 2003). Hd 1, which is orthologous to Arabidopsis CONSTANS (CO), regulates the expression <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 3 a. Hd 1 stimulates the expression <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 3 a under SD conditions but represses Hd 3 a expression under LD conditions (Hayama and Coupland 2004). In the Ehd 2 -OsMADS 50 -Ehd 1 -RFT 1 flowering pathway, Ehd 1 represents another important expression regulator <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 3 a and RFT 1. Ehd 1 not only up-regulates the expression <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 3 a under SD conditions but also activates the expression <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 3 a and RFT 1 under LD conditions (Doi et al. 2004; Komiya et al. 2009). Ehd 1 expression is regulated by multiple floral regulators, such as OsMADS 50, OsMADS 51, OsMADS 56 and Ehd 2 /Osld 1 /RID 1. Under SD conditions, the floral signal of OsGI is transmitted by OsMADS 51, which is a MADS-box gene downstream of OsGI, to induce the expression of Ehd 1 (Kim et al. 2007). Under LD conditions, Ehd 1 is also up-regulated by OsMADS 50 and Ehd 2 /Osld 1 /RID 1, which is a Cys- 2 /His- 2 -type zinc finger transcription factor, while Ehd 1 expression is repressed by OsMADS 56 (Matsubara et al. 2008; Park et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2008; Ryu et al. 2009). Thus, the expression <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 3 a and RFT 1 is regulated by multiple regulatory networks that govern flower initiation.|$|R

5|$|For graphs G and H, the {{question}} of whether G has a homomorphism to H corresponds to a CSP instance with only one kind of constraint, as follows. The variables are the vertices of G and the domain for each variable is the vertex set <b>of</b> <b>H.</b> An evaluation is a function that assigns to each variable an element of the domain, so a function f from V(G) to V(H). Each edge or arc (u,v) of G then corresponds to the constraint ((u,v), E(H)). This is a constraint expressing that the evaluation should map the arc (u,v) to a pair (f(u),f(v)) that is in the relation E(H), that is, to an arc <b>of</b> <b>H.</b> A solution to the CSP is an evaluation that respects all constraints, so it is exactly a homomorphism from G to H.|$|E

30|$|Under LD conditions, Hd 3 a {{expression}} {{is very low}} in any developmental stage [39]. Diurnal {{expression is}} also lower than under inductive SD conditions [38]. Hd 1 also has {{an important role in}} this suppression, although it works as activator <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 3 a expression under SD. Before the molecular cloning <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 1, it was demonstrated that near-isogenic lines containing hd 1 mutant alleles exhibited not only delayed flowering under SD conditions but also early flowering under LD conditions, indicating that Hd 1 could repress flowering under LD and that Hd 1 function is modified depending on day length [46]. Phytochrome signaling affects this day-length-dependent conversion <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 1 activity because this conversion is not observed in the phytochrome-deficient mutant; flowering of the double mutant se 5 hd 1 (which lacks both phytochrome and functional Hd 1) was slightly later than that of the se 5 single mutant (which lacks only phytochrome) [28]. Consistent with this observation, Hd 3 a mRNA accumulation is lower in se 5 hd 1 than in se 5 mutant lines. The involvement of functional modification <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 1 by day length is further supported by the direct manipulation of OsGI expression and the resulting change in Hd 1 and Hd 3 a expression levels [19]. Overexpression of OsGI delays flowering under both SD and LD, indicating that OsGI can act as a suppressor of flowering signals when it is constitutively expressed. In OsGI overexpressing plants, Hd 1 mRNA levels increase under both SD and LD, whereas Hd 3 a mRNA levels are negatively correlated with Hd 1 mRNA, indicating that Hd 1 can act as a suppressor <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 3 a when it is highly induced by OsGI constitutive expression. OsGI overexpression could also be expected to increase Hd 3 a expression through Ehd 1 up-regulation by the OsGI-OsMADS 51 pathway (see above, Kim et al. [34]), but this effect was not observed, probably because <b>of</b> strong <b>Hd</b> 1 suppressive activity. A comparison of daily temporal expression patterns <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 1 and Hd 3 a indicate that higher expression levels <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 1 during light periods might suppress Hd 3 a. Under SD conditions, wild-type Hd 1 expression starts to increase {{at the beginning of the}} dark period, thus keeping Hd 1 as an activator. OsGI overexpressors, however, express a significant level <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 1 during light periods, thus converting Hd 1 into a repressor. Under LD, wild-type Hd 1 expression starts to increase in the light, resulting in the conversion <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 1 into a suppressor [19]. Thus, the external coincidence model could be applied to rice: Circadian clock-regulated Hd 1 expression and an external light signal mediated by phytochrome generate the specific response to day length [25].|$|R

However, H. pylori possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis. A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication <b>of</b> <b>H.</b> pylori reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence <b>of</b> <b>H.</b> pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E

30|$|Suppressor of Overexpression of Constans 1 (SOC 1) in Arabidopsis is a MADS-box protein, and {{a recent}} genetic study {{suggests}} that FT mediates the activation of SOC 1 downstream of CONSTANS (CO) [44]. SOC 1 directly interacts with AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL 24) MADS-box protein in the shoot apex, and direct binding of the SOC 1 -AGL 24 complex to the promoters of both SOC 1 and AGL 24 upregulates their expression [48]. On the other hand, the regulatory hierarchy and the site of action seem to be different in rice; a T-DNA insertion mutation of OsMADS 50 /OsSOC 1 results in a reduction <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 3 a transcription in leaves, whereas RNAi suppression <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 3 a or <b>of</b> both <b>Hd</b> 3 a and RFT 1 does not result in any change in OsMADS 50 /OsSOC 1 expression.

30|$|Phytochromes {{also affect}} the {{expression}} <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 3 a under SD conditions. Hd 3 a expression under SD conditions is significantly up-regulated in an early-flowering photoperiodic sensitivity 5 (se 5) mutant, {{which has a}} mutation in the gene encoding heme oxygenase, which is required for phytochrome chromophore biogenesis [27, 28]. Flowering under SD conditions is also promoted in phyB mutants that have loss-of-function alleles {{in one of the}} three rice phytochromes[73]. Hd 1 expression is not affected by se 5 or phyB mutations [23, 28]; thus, phytochrome represses Hd 3 a expression downstream or independent <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 1 expression under SD conditions. These phytochrome effects may be reminiscent of the activator-to-repressor conversion of a subset <b>of</b> <b>Hd</b> 1 proteins that is observed under LD (see below; Izawa et al. [28]).|$|R
