5|$|Unusually, {{the score}} omits oboes, English horns, bass clarinets, and trumpets. The bassoons, contrabassoons, and trombones play {{only in the}} first movement, and <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few bars (bassoons and contrabassoons: 339–342 and 362–369; trombones: 343–348 and 367–369).|$|E
5|$|A given flower is open <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single day, opening {{before dawn}} and closing in the afternoon. Flowers are self-fecundating and protogynous (with female parts {{maturing}} first), and will self-pollinate {{if they have}} not been pollinated by insects during the day. While many insects visit the flowers, only some bees actually accomplish pollination. V.thapsus flowering period lasts from June to August in most of its range, extending to September or October in warmer climates. Visitors include halictid bees and hoverflies. The hair on lower stamens may serve to provide footholds for visitors.|$|E

5|$|Although Gilbert wrote {{much of the}} {{foundational}} code for Maniac Mansion, {{the majority of the}} game's events were programmed by Lucasfilm employee David Fox. Fox was between projects and planned to work on the game <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> month, but he remained with the team for six months. With Gilbert, he wrote the characters' dialog and choreographed the action. Winnick's concept art inspired him to add new elements to the game: for example, Fox allowed the player to place a hamster inside the kitchen's microwave.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of August Garbage's involvement was confirmed in a press release from MGM and Radioactive Records, Shirley Manson's record label, which would release the soundtrack and the single. Although Music Week reported that Jamiroquai, Robbie Williams, Sharleen Spiteri, Björk and Melanie C were rejected by the producers before Garbage was chosen, Arnold denied that the other artists had auditioned; the single was suitable <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> film, and was not created with a particular artist in mind.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Worsley found {{a command}} in the Merchant Navy, and, giving his age as 64 (he was {{actually}} 69), was appointed {{master of the}} Dalriada in August 1941. He worked to keep the harbour entrance at Sheerness clear of wrecked shipping and also carried out salvage work. His command was <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few months for when the company that owned his vessel found out his true age, he was replaced. Unhappy at being put into the Merchant Navy Reserve Pool, he continued to advocate for a useful posting.|$|E

5|$|Ewell {{interpreted}} {{his orders}} as calling <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cannonade. His 32 guns, along with A. P.

Finally, about six o'clock, Ewell sent orders to each of his division commanders to attack the Union lines in his front.|$|E
5|$|From {{time to time}} special {{seasonal}} {{festivals and}} events are held. They last <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> set {{period of time and}} offer a variety of fun or useful rewards. Many events have changed over time, adding new features and eliminating old ones. These events are geared towards any level, often restricting players to level 1, so that veterans and novice players alike can join in together. Events celebrated are often thematically based on real life equivalents, for example: Valentione's Day in place of Valentine's Day, the Egg Hunt Egg-stravaganza in place of Easter, and the Starlight Celebration in place of Christmas.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 the Notre Dame Island {{site was}} reopened (primarily for the Floralies) making both islands {{simultaneously}} accessible again, albeit <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brief time. Minor thematic exhibitions {{were held at}} the Atlantic pavilion and Quebec pavilion at this period. After the 1981 season, the Saint Helen's Island site permanently closed, shutting out the majority of attractions. Man and His World was able to continue in a limited fashion with {{the small number of}} pavilions left standing on Notre Dame Island. However, the few remaining original exhibits closed permanently in 1984.|$|E

5|$|In April 1918 {{the militia}} {{artillery}} was again mobilised, although this time <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> month, when {{news that the}} German commerce raiders Wolf and Seeadler had entered Australian waters the previous year. In June 1918 {{the number of troops}} actively employed on home service was 9,215, of which 2,476 were regulars. At this time the Navy took over the task of providing guards for ships in harbour and communications facilities, thus allowing for many of the militia troops to be released for further training, and as such it was decided to increase the period of camp training for the militia from eight days to 24.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, series {{producer}} Katsuhiro Harada {{stated that}} while no characters {{will be paid}} downloadable content (DLC), those who pre-order the game at select retailers {{will be able to}} play as {{one or more of the}} four DLC characters (Ancient Ogre, Angel, Kunimitsu and Michelle Chang) at launch, but <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> limited period of time before the content is made available for free to all players.|$|E
5|$|Parasola auricoma is a {{saprobic}} species, and so obtains nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter into simpler molecules. The fruit bodies grow either singly or in groups, often in large numbers, at road sides in deciduous forests, or on grassy areas. The mushrooms are short-lived, usually lasting <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{few hours before}} collapsing. Common in Europe and North America (including Hawaii), {{it has also been}} recorded from Japan. In Europe, fruit bodies appear most commonly in spring and summer months, while in North America, fruiting is more common in the late summer and autumn, after rains.|$|E

5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} who do {{not feel}} well despite optimal levothyroxine dosing may request adjunctive treatment with liothyronine. A 2012 guideline from the European Thyroid Association recommends that support should be offered {{with regards to the}} chronic nature of the disease and that other causes of the symptoms should be excluded. Addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> trial period of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine. The guideline explicitly aims to enhance the safety of this approach and to counter its indiscriminate use.|$|E
5|$|Stallions must be {{registered}} New Foresters, {{and are not}} allowed to run free all year round on the Forest. They normally are turned out <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> limited period in the spring and summer, when they gather several groups of mares and youngstock into larger herds and defend them against other stallions. A small number (usually fewer than 50) are turned out, generally between May and August. This ensures that foals are born neither too early (before the spring grass is coming through), nor too late (as the colder weather is setting in and the grazing and browsing on the Forest is dying back) in the following year.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{substantial}} {{revision of the}} election law came in February 2015, and was partially upheld by the Constitutional Court in September 2015. An element of preferential voting was introduced by letting voters choose not <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> list of candidates, but also a single member of the same list. If the percentage of votes for a candidate exceeds 10%, they are elected {{as if it was}} an open list system. The list ranking is maintained for those candidates that do not meet this quota.|$|E
