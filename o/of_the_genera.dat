5|$|During the Cretaceous period, a few {{species of}} {{primitive}} ants ranged widely on the Laurasian supercontinent (the Northern Hemisphere). They were scarce {{in comparison to}} the populations of other insects, representing only about 1% of the entire insect population. Ants became dominant after adaptive radiation {{at the beginning of the}} Paleogene period. By the Oligocene and Miocene, ants had come to represent 20â€“40% of all insects found in major fossil deposits. Of the species that lived in the Eocene epoch, around one in 10 genera survive to the present. Genera surviving today comprise 56% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genera</b> in Baltic amber fossils (early Oligocene), and 92% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genera</b> in Dominican amber fossils (apparently early Miocene).|$|E

5|$|A 1992 phylogenetic {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequences showed a strong {{possibility of a}} clade consisting of Boselaphini, Bovini and Tragelaphini.

Tragelaphini consists of two genera: Taurotragus (eland) and Tragelaphus. A closer relationship between Boselaphini and Tragelaphini was predicted, and seconded by a similar study in 1999.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 57 genera of {{flowering}} plants contain at least 500 species, {{according to a}} 2004 analysis by the botanical taxonomist David Frodin.

5|$|Allosaurus is {{regarded}} as senior synonym <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genera</b> Creosaurus, Epanterias, and Labrosaurus. Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of A. fragilis, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is Labrosaurus ferox, named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is now regarded as an example of A. fragilis.|$|E

5|$|Another {{unidentified}} parrot specimen, {{this one}} brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, {{was described by}} the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which he pointed out {{similarities and differences between}} the two. The English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested the possibility that this might have been a lesser vasa parrot, if not a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni). The specimen is now lost. English zoologist and author George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the Moluccas to Mascarinus in his book A List <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Genera</b> of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters may be infested {{by several}} blood-feeding flies {{of the genus}} Carnus, and the biting fly Ornithophila metallica. Other parasites include chewing lice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genera</b> Meromenopon, Brueeliaa and Meropoecus, {{some of which are}} {{specialist}} parasites of bee-eaters, and the stickfast flea Echidnophaga gallinacea. The hole-nesting lifestyle of bee-eaters means that they tend to carry a higher burden of external parasites than non-hole-nesting bird species. Bee-eaters may also be infected by protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus including H. meropis.|$|E
5|$|Described {{as being}} similar to members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genera</b> Pareledone, Eledone, and Enteroctopus, V. togata {{has a large}} body with large eyes and {{extensive}} membranes that link the octopus' arms together. The species has a single line of suckers on each arm, and its head, mantle, and part of its arms are covered in warts. Although the reproductive habits of V. togata have not been extensively studied, the species {{is believed to be}} one of the most fecund among octopuses in its region and depth level, despite the species possessing large eggs and extremely large spermatophores.|$|E

500|$|<b>Of</b> <b>the</b> fifteen <b>genera</b> within <b>the</b> Liliaceae, <b>the</b> ten <b>genera</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lilioideae {{subfamily}} {{form one}} morphological {{group that is}} characterised by contractile bulbs and roots, and a Fritillaria-type embryo-sac (megagametophyte with four megaspores). Within the Lilioideae, Clintonia and the closely related Medeola form a subclade, and are now considered a separate tribe (Medeoleae). The other major grouping consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five <b>genera</b> constituting <b>the</b> Streptopoideae (including Scoliopus) and Calochortoideae (including [...] Tricyrtis) subfamilies characterised by creeping rhizomes, styles which are divided at their apices, and by megagametophyte development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polygonum-type (a simple megaspore and triploid endosperm) embryo-sac.|$|R
5|$|External parasites include chewing lice of {{the genus}} Saemundssonia, feather lice and fleas such as Ceratophyllus borealis. Lice are often host specific, and the closely related common and Arctic terns carry quite {{different}} species. Internal parasites include the crustacean Reighardia sternae, and tapeworms such as Ligula intestinalis and members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genera</b> Diphyllobothrium and Schistocephalus. Terns are normally free of blood parasites, unlike gulls that often carry Haemoproteus species. An exception is the brown noddy, which sometimes harbours protozoa of that genus. In 1961 the common tern was the first wild bird species identified as being infected with avian influenza, the H5N3 variant being found in an outbreak involving South African birds. Several species of terns have been implicated as carriers of West Nile virus.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the molds Sepedonium ampullosporum, S.laevigatum, and S.chalcipori. In Sepedonium infections, a {{white to}} powdery yellow mold covers {{the surface of}} the fruit body. The {{mushrooms}} are a food source and rearing habitat for several insect species, including the fungus gnats Mycetophila fisherae and M.signatoides, and flies such as Pegomya winthemi and species <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genera</b> Sciophila and Mydaea. The cottontail rabbit species Sylvilagus brasiliensis has been recorded feeding on the mushrooms in Costa Rica.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes are preyed on by a {{wide range}} of animals, {{including}} various reptiles, amphibians, birds, mammals, and insects. Mammalian predators such as coatis and meerkats roll captured millipedes on the ground to deplete and rub off their defensive secretions before consuming their prey, and certain poison dart frogs are believed to incorporate the toxic compounds of millipedes into their own defences. Several invertebrates have specialised behaviours or structures to feed on millipedes, including larval glowworm beetles, Probolomyrmex ants, chlamydephorid slugs, and predaceous dung beetles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genera</b> Sceliages and Deltochilum. A large subfamily of assassin bugs, the Ectrichodiinae with over 600 species, has specialized in preying upon millipedes. Parasites of millipedes include nematodes, phaeomyiid flies, and acanthocephalans.|$|E
