60|$|While {{these things}} were in progress, the Neshamony was not idle. She made six voyages between the Reef and the Peak in that month, {{carrying}} to the last, fish, fresh pork, various necessaries from the ship, as well as eggs and salt. Some of the fowls were caught and transferred to the Peak, as well as half-a-dozen of the porkers. The return cargo consisted of reed-birds, in large quantities, several other varieties of birds, bread-fruits, bananas, yams, cocoa-nuts, and a fruit that Heaton discovered, which was of a most delicious flavour, resembling strawberries and cream, and which was afterwards ascertained to be the charra-moya, the fruit that, of all others, when good, is thought to surpass everything else of that nature. Bridget also picked a basket of famously large wild strawberries on the Summit, {{and sent them to}} Anne. In return. Anne sent her sister, not <b>only</b> <b>cream</b> and milk, by each passage, but a little fresh butter. The calves had been weaned, and the two cows were now giving their largest quantity of milk, furnishing almost as much butter as was wanted.|$|R

Technically, the name [...] "true goat's cheese" [...] is misleading, since goat cheese (such as the French chèvre) is relatively uncommon in Norway, and is commonly called Hvit geitost ("white goat's cheese") to avoid confusion.|$|R

5000|$|Smoky black foals {{must always}} {{have at least}} one parent with the cream dilute gene and at least one parent that carries the [...] "E" [...] {{extension}} gene associated with black coloring. This could occur one of two ways: A foal could have a smoky black parent or a buckskin parent carrying both genes within a single horse. A smoky black could also be produced by breeding one horse with <b>only</b> the <b>cream</b> dilution, such as a palomino, to a bay or black horse carrying only the extension gene, but no cream dilution. As foals, smoky blacks are typically quite silvery, and may be mistaken for grullos, especially when born with primitive countershading. Smoky black foals are sometimes born with reddish tufts of hair in their ears. However, both traits are also seen in many true black foals as well.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, sugar {{shortages}} during World War I hurt {{sales of}} Archibald Query's Marshmallow Creme, so Query sold his recipe in 1920 to two men from Swampscott, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower, who began distributing the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. The pair renamed the product Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff, and Durkee-Mower continues {{to sell the}} product under the name Marshmallow Fluff. The sandwich made with peanut butter and marshmallow fluff continued to be eaten, but was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960, when an advertising firm Durkee-Mower hired created the term as a more effective way to market the sandwich. Fluffernutter is a registered trademark of Durkee-Mower, although the company's U.S. trademark registrations for the term cover <b>only</b> ice <b>cream</b> and printed recipes. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued Williams-Sonoma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its trademark by selling a marshmallow and peanut butter chocolate-covered candy under the Fluffernutter name.|$|R
40|$|Dairying in Iowa {{has been}} an {{essential}} part of most farm operations. The skim milk resulting from farm separation of the cream has been a useful supplement to com in the swine feeding operations which constitute the most important single phase of Iowa agriculture. Because of this relationship between dairying and hog farming, the dairy processing industry in Iowa has been based primarily on one product, butter, and most of this has been manufactured in creameries receiving <b>only</b> farm-separated <b>cream.</b> Many of these creameries were established 50 - 60 years ago when the roads and transportation facilities of the time dictated the need for many local plants which tended to remain small. Over the years this system of dairy marketing has persisted in Iowa. In other important dairy sections of the United States, there has been a trend to concentrate dairy processing in larger plants manufacturing a number of different products. [URL]...|$|R
