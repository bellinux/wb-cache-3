40|$|Interconnection of IP QoS {{capabilities}} between networks releases considerable value. In {{this paper}} we show where this value will be realised. We give technical and economic arguments for why QoS {{will be provided}} in core and backbone networks as a bulk QoS facility incapable of distinguishing or charging differentially between sessions. While between edge networks a vibrant mix of retail QoS solutions will be possible, including Internet-wide per-flow guarantees. We <b>outline</b> <b>cutting</b> edge research on how to coordinate QoS between networks, using a session-based overlay between the edges that will extract most surplus value, underpinned by a bulk QoS layer coordinating the whole. We survey today’s interconnect tariffs and the current disconnected state of IP QoS. Then we describe a commercial ‘model of models ’ that allows incremental evolution towards an interconnected future. The paper covers intertwined engineering and economic/commercial issues in some depth, but considerable effort {{has been made to}} allow both communities to understand the whole paper. ...|$|E
60|$|The {{idea of a}} fort in this {{association}} owed little to imagination. For on the nibbled green steep above the kiln stood a bye-gone, worn- out specimen of such an erection, huge, impressive, and difficult to scale even now in its decay. It was a British castle or entrenchment, with triple rings of defence, rising roll behind roll, their <b>outlines</b> <b>cutting</b> sharply against the sky, and Jim's kiln nearly undermining their base. When the lime-kiln flared up in the night, which it often did, its fires lit up the front of these ramparts to a great majesty. They were old friends of his, and while keeping up the heat through the long darkness, as it was sometimes his duty to do, he would imagine the dancing lights and shades about the stupendous earthwork to be the forms of those giants who (he supposed) had heaped it up. Often he clambered upon it, and walked about the summit, thinking out the problems connected with his business, his partner, his future, his Margery.|$|R

40|$|This is a video {{resource}} {{to support the}} teaching of catalysis at A-level. It features explanations of the underlying theory, coupled with an <b>outline</b> of <b>cutting</b> {{research in this area}} of Chemistry at the University of Southampton, which relates to the A-level topic. The video files are in the. zip folder, and instructions for how to access them {{can be found in the}} attached document. You will also find a Word document called 'Skeleton notes', which is designed to be printed out by students and completed as they watch the video. We will be seeking feedback from students who use the resource, to find out their views about its effectiveness in educational terms.

5000|$|Silhouette {{can refer}} {{to the art of}} <b>cutting</b> <b>outlines</b> or portraits out of black paper. Modern-day papercutters {{typically}} follow {{one or more of the}} [...] "traditional" [...] styles listed above, while others have begun to expand the art into new styles, motifs, and designs. Contemporary papercutting is also sometimes associated with the art of stenciling, itself being derived from techniques used in graffiti art. The use of hand-cut stencils in graffiti art has received international attention in recent years due in part to the artist Banksy.|$|R
50|$|A {{committee}} {{was set up}} to oversee the project, the 'Cavaliers of the Devizes Millennium White Horse', and members of the public were invited to join. The group was also formed to support its future maintenance. Alan Truscott, of Sarsens Housing, joined the committee as the member in charge of the surveying and pegging out of the figure of the horse on the hill, alongside did Keith Saunders of Pearce Civil Engineering, who joined to provide the machinery and manpower to complete the clearing of the top soil and the infilling of the chalk following the <b>cutting</b> of the <b>outline,</b> the <b>cutting</b> of which was done by hand by various groups and individuals from the local community. 200 people helped cut the figure. It was anticipated that this project will promote Devizes, its ancient heritage and the attractive countryside surrounding it, as well as to be an additional feature to the tourist map of the area.|$|R

This work was the standard text on the subject of stone <b>cutting,</b> <b>outlining</b> the principles of three-dimensional geometry. Frézier illustrates complicated intersections between forms such as spheres and cones.

40|$|A {{machined}} surface {{can be seen}} as a replica of the geometric <b>outline</b> of the <b>cutting</b> tool nose during the process of cylindrical turning, and the texture of the {{machined surface}} varies along with the tool wear. A new method of on-line turned surface monitoring is proposed in this paper by studying the grey value characteristics of the turned surface digital image. The regularity of the surface image is judged and analysed by using wavelet transform, fractal analysis, and discreteness analysis of the wavelength of the texture contour. The average wave contour, which can reflect processing state and the condition of the turned surface, is extracted from the regular texture image. Experimental results show that the turned surface condition can be monitored on-line effectively with the presented method...|$|R
25|$|The {{celebrations}} were formalized {{and standardized}} by Commandant Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr. in 1952, <b>outlining</b> the cake <b>cutting</b> ceremony, which {{would enter the}} Marine Drill Manual in 1956. By tradition, the first slice of cake {{is given to the}} oldest Marine present, who in turn hands it off to the youngest Marine present, symbolizing the old and experienced Marines passing their knowledge to the new generation of Marines. The celebration also includes a reading of Marine Corps Order 47, republished every year, as well as a message from the current Commandant, and often includes a banquet and dancing if possible. In many cases, the birthday celebration will also include a pageant of current and historical Marine Corps uniforms, as a reminder {{of the history of the}} Corps. Another modern tradition includes a unit run on the 10th. Marines are reputed to celebrate the birthday, regardless of where they may be in the world, even in austere environments or combat.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} {{the response of}} plasmonic systems in a quantum optics setting. This work can be grouped into two sub-investigations, the study of macroscopic and microscopic responses. The narrative of the thesis comprises three principal parts. First, we give an in-depth review {{of the field of}} quantum plasmonics as it is an important theme that runs through the work contained in this thesis. In particular, we focus on <b>outlining</b> the <b>cutting</b> edge research that is being done on the intense interactions between plasmonic systems and quantum emitters. This leads naturally to the first investigation into the macroscopic response of quantum plasmonic systems in a metamaterial setting. We outline how complex hybrid systems of plasmonic metal nanoparticles (MNP) and two-level quantum dots (QD) can be used to create a quantum plasmonic metamaterial. Metamaterials are structures composed of periodic lattices of identical subwavelength unit cell scatterers, each of which governs completely the electromagnetic properties of the entire bulk material. We theorize the use of MNP-QD nanorings as a unit cell in order to control the macroscopic magnetic properties of the metamaterial. We outline how such a metamaterial can have a tunable, and saturable, magnetic permeability. In {{the last part of the}} thesis we consider the model of a single light mode interacting ultrastrongly with a collection of emitters, in the anticipation that quantum plasmonic systems can be brought into this ultrastrong-coupling regime (USC). In particular we study the emission of the system after the coupling between the light mode and the emitters is non-adiabatically switched-on. We find evidence that for both two-level, and multi-level, emitters in the USC, both the counter-rotating terms and the diamagnetic term must be included to prevent qualitative errors.

40|$|We {{consider}} the well-known Canonical DC (CDC) optimization problem, relying on an alternative equivalent formulation {{based on a}} polar characterization of the constraint, and a novel generalization of this problem, which we name Single Reverse Polar problem (SRP). We study the theoretical properties of the new class of (SRP) problems, and contrast them with those of (CDC) problems. We introduce {{of the concept of}} ``approximate oracle'' for the optimality conditions of (CDC) and (SRP), and make a thorough study of the impact of approximations in the optimality conditions onto the quality of the approximate optimal solutions, that is the feasible solutions which satisfy them. Afterwards, we develop very general hierarchies of convergence conditions, similar but not identical for (CDC) and (SRP), starting from very abstract ones and moving towards more readily implementable ones. Six and three different sets of conditions are proposed for (CDC) and (SRP), respectively. As a result, we propose very general algorithmic schemes, based on approximate oracles and the developed hierarchies, giving rise to many different implementable algorithms, which can be proven to generate an approximate optimal value in a finite number of steps, where the error can be managed and controlled. Among them, six different implementable algorithms for (CDC) problems, four of which are new and can't be reduced to the original cutting plane algorithm for (CDC) and its modifications; the connections of our results with the existing algorithms in the literature are <b>outlined.</b> Also, three <b>cutting</b> plane algorithms for solving (SRP) problems are proposed, which seem to be new and cannot be reduced to each other...|$|R
5000|$|Steve, [...] "Doc", Charlie, and Dorothy are astronauts {{on a ship}} {{approaching}} Mars. Following {{a scheduled}} cutoff of communications, they encounter and collide with something in orbit around Mars. They are forced to jettison the main stage and land in the control section. They leave in suits, taking with them some essentials, such as inflatable boats and paddles, with a rifle. They paddle down a canal, being attacked by water creatures, and eventually enter a cave system. The cave {{comes to an end}} near a lava flow, and they are forced to leave the boats and edge around a lava lake, eventually finding a passage to the surface, just before the volcano erupts in a Lava fountain. They think they hear the signal of the main stage, but {{it turns out to be}} from an automated biolab, sent to determine the habitability of Mars. Charlie becomes hysterical and shoots the lab, inadvertently revealing that it has enough oxygen left to replenish their dwindling oxygen supplies. A sandstorm blows in and they take shelter in the lee of the lab. The sandstorm uncovers a stone road, which they follow to an abandoned stone city. The city proves to have a breathable atmosphere, which enables them to remove their suits. Exploring, they discover two charred <b>outlines</b> beside a <b>cutting</b> torch near a wall with a partially cut hole and later a column with a hole in it. The column proves to be hollow and a nearby one turns out to conceal a desiccated Martian, with a transparent braincase. Mental communication between it and Steve guides him to a hall, which contains a projection of a head. It reveals that it represents the collective consciousness of all Martians. They were an old race, who once ruled a good part of the galaxy, but who retreated to Mars to ponder. To give themselves time to think, they took their city out of time, in an eternal present. Eventually they discovered that they had a further destiny, but could not reverse the process, being then incapable of physical effort. The city had been previously entered by other beings, who thought to plunder, instead of help. It directs them to a sphere, which must be replaced in the mechanism, in order for time to begin moving forward once again. X drops the sphere, revealing a model of the city. They return to where the others have been cutting a hole in the wall and complete the task. Behind the wall is a giant metal pendulum. Charlie, with help from Steve manages to replace the sphere in the clockwork above the pendulum. The pendulum begins to swing once again. They escape as the city begins to crumble, eventually fading away. They eventually collapse by the stone road and vanish. They reappear in their ship in orbit, dirty and exhausted, where only two minutes have passed.|$|R
