[...] Critics noted an influence from British rock bands from the 1960s, as well as The Smiths, and slower, love-themed ballads featured more heavily on the album than the fast-paced, rockier songs that typifies the band's sound. Turner wrote much of the album in his apartment on an acoustic guitar, further influencing the ballad-style prevalent on the album.|$|E

It became a prominent issue after a nationally televised game against Notre Dame. The mouthpiece became a symbol for two opposing viewpoints: for Mexican-Americans, it was a symbol of unity—Sanchez accepting his heritage; for critics, the gesture symbolized a radical political statement. Sanchez, who {{was born and raised in}} the United States, received hate mail urging him to return to Mexico. Sanchez responded to the controversy stating, [...] "It’s not a Mexican power thing <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> It’s just a little bit of pride in our heritage. Hopefully, it inspires somebody and it’s all for the best."

[...] The jury found that the alleged misconduct would not have led to Churchill's firing and rejected the university's academic misconduct claim as the grounds for dismissal. On April 1, 2009, a Colorado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired, and awarded $1 in damages. As {{one of the jurors}} said later in a press interview, [...] "it wasn't a slap in his face <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> when we didn't give him any money.

While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The pinch {{always seemed}} {{to come in the}} matter of clothes, and then Marcia gave up {{whatever}} she wanted, and said she must make the old things do. Bartley hated this; in his position he must dress well, and, as there was nothing mean about him, he wished Marcia to dress well to. Just at this time he had set his heart on her having a certain sacque which they had noticed in a certain window one day when they were on Washington Street together. He surprised her a week later by bringing the sacque home to her, and he surprised himself with a seal-skin cap which he had long coveted: it was coming winter, now, and for half a dozen days of the season he would really need the cap. There would be many days when it would be comfortable, and many others when it would be tolerable, and he looked so handsome in it that Marcia herself could not quite feel that it was an extravagance. She asked him how they could afford both of the things at once, but he answered with easy mystery that he had provided the funds; and she went gayly round with him to call on the Hallecks that evening and show off her sacque. It was so stylish and pretty that it won her a compliment from Ben Halleck, which she noticed {{because it was the first}} compliment, <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it, <b>that</b> he had ever paid her. She repeated it to Bartley. [...] "He said <b>that</b> I looked <b>like</b> a Hungarian princess that he saw in Vienna." ...|$|R
60|$|And why? Because, {{it seems}} to me, they were what Englishmen ought to be--what too many Englishmen are too apt to boast of being in these days, while they are not so, <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it--and <b>that</b> is, honest men and {{practical}} men. They had taught the children {{to say that they}} were members of Christ, children of God, and inheritors of the kingdom of heaven; and they had taught the children, when they said that, to mean what they said; for they had no notion that 'I am,' meant 'I may possibly be;' or that 'I was made,' meant 'There is a chance of my being made some time or other.' They would not have dared to teach children to say things which were most probably not true. So believing really what they taught, they believed also that the children were justified. For if a child is not justified in being a member of Christ, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven, what is he justified in being? Is not that exactly the just, right, and proper state for him, and for every man?--the very state in which all men were meant originally to be, in which all men ought to have been? So they looked on these children as being in the just, right, and proper way, on which God looks with satisfaction and pleasure, and in which alone a man can do just, right, and proper things, by the Spirit of Christ, which He gives daily and hourly to those who belong to Him and trust in Him and in His Father.|$|R

This took place on January 29, 2013, after the petition against his casting had gained momentum. Viewing his character as a separate person and not a fictionalized version of himself, Tyson said, [...] "I have no emotional connection to the role. As a human being I can relate to it, but {{it has nothing to do}} with me." [...] He also mentioned being a fan of SVU, calling it [...] "the most exciting show on TV" [...] and saying [...] "My wife Spicer, whom he wed in 2009 and I looked on this show a lot, especially when I was going through my relapse and drug periods." [...] In response to the criticism, Tyson maintained, as he has since 1992, that he was innocent of raping Desiree Washington.

500|$|The {{concept of}} Gus {{installing}} a surveillance camera into the meth lab {{stemmed from the}} idea of Walter and Gus employing what Gilligan called [...] "brinkmanship and gamesmanship" [...] against each other after their falling {{out at the end of}} the third season. Gilligan commented: [...] "What's one way Gus can amp up the story there? How can he mess with Walt's head a little bit?" [...] The footage shown from the first-person perspective of the camera is actual footage from the real camera, including the numbers shown at the top and bottom of the screen. This is why that shot is shown in pillarbox and in lower quality than the rest of the episode, which was shot in 35 mm film. The episode features a subplot with Marie engaging in acts of kleptomania, which had been a major part of her character during the first season. Catlin said it was conceived early on that Marie would act this way while brainstorming the ideas for Marie coping with Hank's difficult recovery. Gilligan described Marie's acts of stealing as a respite for her: [...] "She's looking for another life, but she's not actively ready to leave her husband <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> ... We liked the quirkiness of it." [...] Betsy Brandt said [...] "Open House" [...] was her favorite episode of the season to shoot.|$|E

After the screening of the scenes, Lister explained: [...] "It was quite nerve-wracking actually as I'm good friends with Loui — it's quite a strange thing to smooch a really good friend so we had to get over the giggles and think 'right, just do it!'" [...] Also commenting on her worries about the scenes, she said: [...] "I thought it was hilarious! I thought it'd be interesting, though. I was obviously quite worried about them. Loui [...] and I chatted a lot when we found out {{that it was going to}} be in the late-night eps and we were wondering 'oh no, what does this mean?!'

The second trailer for the game, released on May 31, 2008, revealed a more racially diverse group of enemies and the African BSAA agent Alomar, who assists the protagonist. Critics felt that Alomar's character was added {{to address the issue of}} racism, though Karen Dyer said the character had been in development before the first trailer was released. Takeuchi denied that complaints about racism had any effect in altering the design of Resident Evil 5. He acknowledged that different cultures may have had differing opinions about the trailer, though said he did not expect there to be further complaints once the game was released and people were [...] "able to play the game and see what it is for themselves".

In time, when you get intimate with her, intimate enough to introduce the subject, your course would be to impress this upon her so strongly as to induce her to make an open confession. Of course you would point out to her that this could now in no way injure the man who is her lover, as he has gone no one knows where, and will certainly never return to this country, as upon his appearance he would at once be arrested and tried on the charge of killing the gamekeeper. All this would be perfectly open and above-board. Then, Mary, you could, if you deemed it expedient, own your own strong interest in the matter. There would be nothing treacherous in this, dear. You simply urge her to do an act of justice. Of course it will be painful for her to do so, after concealing it so long.

Since then, they've blown those doors wide open." [...] He added, [...] "We have relatively free rein we just can't go anywhere that [...] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told [...] "no" [...] that much". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as [...] "something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe.

His feat {{was the first of}} its kind since Rube Waddell achieved it on July 4, 1905. Davis was the designated hitter until he was pressed into service as a relief pitcher in the 16th inning after Showalter had depleted the Orioles' bullpen. He struck out two batters and did not allow a run in his two innings of mound work. He was the first position player in the American League (AL) to be the winning pitcher in a game since Rocky Colavito on August 25, 1968, and the first to pitch for the Orioles since Manny Alexander on April 19, 1996. He and losing pitcher Darnell McDonald were the first position players on opposing teams in the same contest to each work in relief since Ty Cobb and George Sisler on October 4, 1925, and the first where both earned pitching decisions since Sam Mertes and Jesse Burkett on September 28, 1902. Davis described his outing: [...] "After the first inning, I was just trying to get it over the plate, and I was like, 'This is a lot harder than it looks.' I told myself to start using my legs so I didn't blow my arm out <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> But in all seriousness, to get a win like that here, to end a road trip like this, it's huge. Neither team wanted to lose today, especially when it goes to extra innings. I mean, they would have pulled people out of the stands to finish that game. It's just a huge win for us." ...|$|E
500|$|According to The Sunday People, [...] "though {{critics said}} it was an affectionate tribute about a nice man. Van went on to urge fans not to buy it." [...] According to The Boston Globe, Van Morrison [...] "disdained the book". In an {{interview}} with The Boston Globe, Turner commented on this: [...] "He considers anything that reveals details of family background <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> an invasion of his privacy. He doesn't believe in biographies, and I do." [...] When the biography came out in hardcover, Van Morrison sent Turner 36 statements from the book that he called [...] "lies, gross exaggerations and innuendo". Van Morrison told Turner that none of the 40 individuals the author had interviewed for the biography were currently friends of his. The letter from Van Morrison to Turner concluded with: [...] "I am very sorry that you feel you are entitled to earn a living by peddling distortions and inaccuracies about me personally." [...] In his reply letter to Van Morrison, Turner wrote: [...] "You may not think you are 'difficult' or 'introvert' but other people do and have the right to express their opinions." [...] The Sunday Times reported that [...] "Allegedly, Van's management even considered buying up all 25,000 copies of the book to pulp them," [...] and this was also reported in The Independent. The Evening Times wrote that Van Morrison [...] "reportedly tried to buy all the copies of a biography by Steve Turner." [...] Representatives for Van Morrison did not confirm whether he attempted to purchase the 25,000 copies of the biography, and confirmed that [...] "representatives of the singer discussed various possibilities". Van Morrison's manager, Chris O'Donnell, said of the musician: [...] "He is not happy about books, period. He is an artist and stands up for himself – he doesn't want his private life raked over." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 4 July 1941, Caldwell saw a German pilot {{shoot and}} kill a close friend, Pilot Officer Donald Munro, who was {{descending}} {{to the ground}} in a parachute. This was a controversial practice, but was nevertheless common among some German and Allied pilots. One biographer, Kristin Alexander, suggests that it may have caused Caldwell's attitude to harden significantly. Months later, press officers and journalists popularised Caldwell's nickname of [...] "Killer", which he disliked. One reason for the nickname was that he too shot enemy airmen after they parachuted out of aircraft. Caldwell commented many years later: [...] "... there was no blood lust <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> about it <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> It {{was just a matter of}} not wanting them back to have another go at us. I never shot any who landed where they could be taken prisoner." [...] (In later life, Caldwell said that his thoughts often turned to one Japanese airman or passenger, who survived Caldwell's last aerial victory but could not be rescued.) A more commonly cited reason for the nickname was his habit of using up ammunition left over at the end of sorties, to shoot up enemy troop convoys and vehicles. During his war service, Caldwell wrote in a notebook: [...] "it's your life or theirs. This is war." ...|$|R
5000|$|These early discoveries by Oort {{about the}} Milky Way overthrew the Kapteyn system, named after his mentor, which had envisioned a galaxy that was {{symmetrical}} around the Sun. As Oort later noted, “Kapteyn {{and his co-workers}} had not realized that the absorption in the galactic plane was {{as bad as it}} turned out to be.” Until Oort began his work, he later recalled, “the Leiden Observatory had been concentrating entirely on positional astronomy, meridian circle work and some proper motion work. But no astrophysics <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> looked <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> No structure of the galaxy, no dynamics of the galaxy. There was no one else in Leiden who was interested in these problems in which I was principally interested, so the first years I worked more or less by myself in these projects. De Sitter was interested, but his main line of research was celestial mechanics; at that time the expanding universe had moved away from his direct interest.” As the European Space Agency states, Oort “shook the scientific world by demonstrating that the Milky Way rotates like a giant ‘Catherine Wheel.’” He showed that all the stars in the galaxy were “travelling independently through space, with those nearer the center rotating much faster than those further away.” ...|$|R
6000|$|It cost us a {{month or}} six weeks' time to perform this voyage, in which time we went on shore several times for water and provisions, and found the natives always very free and courteous; but we were {{surprised}} one morning early, being at the extremity of the northernmost part of the island, when one of our men cried out, [...] "A sail! a sail!" [...] We presently saw a vessel a great way out at sea; but after we had looked at it with our perspective glasses, and endeavoured all we could to make out what it was, we could not tell what to think of it; for it was neither ship, ketch, galley, galliot, <b>or</b> <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> we had ever seen before; all that we could make of it was, that it went from us, standing out to sea. In a word, we soon lost sight of it, for we were in no condition to chase anything, and we never saw it again; but, by all that we could perceive of it, from what we saw of such things afterwards, it was some Arabian vessel, which had been trading to the coast of Mozambique, or Zanzibar, the same place where we afterwards went, as you shall hear.|$|R
