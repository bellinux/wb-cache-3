500|$|Within the level, {{there were}} four large lakes or meres, of which the biggest was Whittlesey Mere. It was used for leisure boating, and was {{described}} by Celia Fiennes in 1697, who stated that it was [...] long and [...] wide, and noted that it was sometimes dangerous, since it was prone to sudden winds rising up 'like hurricanes'. In order to maintain and improve the route between Salters Lode Sluice on the Great Ouse and Stanground Sluice on the River Nene, another Act of Parliament was obtained in 1754. This created Commissioners to manage the waterways, with powers to charge 3 old pence (1.25p) per ton on goods entering the system through either of the sluices. Agricultural produce was carried through Salters Lode, bound for Kings Lynn, while coal, timber and groceries moved in the opposite direction. Pleasure boats were specifically excluded from paying tolls, as were certain products including manure, compost, malt dust, pigeons' dung and some varieties of <b>oil</b> <b>cake.</b> Another account {{of the system is}} provided by George Walpole's Journal of the Voyage round the Fens in 1774, which was made in a fleet of nine boats, all of which were towed by a single horse called Hippopotamus when there was insufficient wind for sailing. Carpenters were employed to jack up or remove bridges which were too low for the boats to pass, and although the expedition lasted for 22 days, Walpole only recorded one gang of lighters, which delayed them as Salters Lode.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Twenty two fungi were {{isolated}} from different <b>oil</b> <b>cakes,</b> namely, coconut, groundnut and sesamum. Of these, Aspergillus flavus and A. niger {{were isolated}} {{from all the}} samples of groundnut and sesamum <b>oil</b> <b>cakes.</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>cakes</b> collected during June-July had the highest population of fungi. Positive and significant correlation was obtained between weather parameters and population of fungi. Key words: <b>Oil</b> <b>cakes,</b> fungal deterioration. <b>Oil</b> <b>cakes</b> are traditionally and widely used as manure and are the major constituents of cattle and poultry feed. Deterioration by microorganisms {{is a serious problem}} encountered in the storage and trans-port of <b>oil</b> <b>cakes.</b> Fungi are the major group respon-sible for the spoilage of <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> (philip, 1978;Nusrath and Nahdi, 1983 and Reddy et al., 1986). It has been estimated that at least 10 per cent of coconut products are lost as a result of mirotial activity (Subrahmanyan etal., 1965). Environmental factors also play an im-portant role in deterioration of stored products. (Subramanian, 1956; Niza, 1981). The present study aims at investigating the fungi responsible for the spoil-age of different <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> during storage and transit. MATERIALS AND METHODS <b>Oil</b> <b>cakes</b> of coconut, groundnut and sesamumwere collected from different oil mills of the state, during three different periods of the year, namely, February-March, June-July and October-November. The population in different samples of <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> was estimated immediately after collection and after storage for one month in gunny bags at room temperature (28 ± 2 °C).

40|$|Among the {{research}} {{on the history of}} Chinese agriculture in Japan, the previous research on paddy field cultivation utilized "hard-work" and "heavy-fertilizing" as analytical indicators. There is a problem with such cultivation that the amount of energy invested is large, while that of energy generated from the production is small. In order to comprehensively examine the overall picture of paddy field cultivation, it is effective to analyze it from a "soil fertility" perspective. This {{is a good example of}} effective research, because an improvement of soil fertility is not synonymous with an increase in fertilizer application. Although <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> were common as fertilizer by the middle of the Qing Period, and it was an age when "heavy-fertilizing" was just beginning. The application of fertilizer dependent on <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> can cause physiological disorders of various kinds. To solve this problem, the application of combustion ash had been considered to be effective. However, compared to the supply of <b>oil</b> <b>cakes,</b> that of combustion ash was not sufficient. Therefore, determining whether the increase in application of <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> led to an improvement of soil fertility remains a matter to reconsider. In Pre-modern China, there were some other methods that were considered effective to improve soil fertility, such as winter flooded paddy fields, soil dressing and paddy-upland rotation fields, etc [...] However, when viewed from the modern agricultural perspective, some of them are regarded as illogical. Research on Chinese agricultural history including the ideological background of the people of the time is needed in the future...|$|R
2500|$|The {{seeds of}} Ricinus communis are {{commonly}} crushed to extract castor oil. [...] As ricin is not oil-soluble, little {{is found in}} the extracted castor oil. The extracted oil is also heated to more than 80°C to denature any ricin that may be present. The remaining spent crushed seeds, called variously the [...] "cake", [...] "oil cake", and [...] "press cake", can contain up to 5% ricin. While the <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> from coconut, peanuts, and sometimes cotton seeds can be used as either cattle feed and/or fertilizer, the toxic nature of castor beans precludes their <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> from being used as feed unless the ricin is first deactivated by autoclaving.

Nematode infested soil {{was treated with}} D-D at 0, 0. 05, 0. 10 and 0. 15 ml/kg, and sodium azide at 0, 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg soil 2 weeks before sowing. Carbofuran was applied at 0, 0. 0450, 0. 0675 and 0. 0900 mg/kg soil 2 hr before sowing. <b>Oil</b> <b>cakes</b> of mustard and cotton seeds were mixed with the soil at 0, 0. 25, 0. 50 and 1. 0 % (w/w) and allowed to decompose for 2 weeks before sowing. Twenty five TPS were sown in each pot under all experiments. Seven days after germination seedlings were thinned and 10 plants/pot were allowed to grow for 6 weeks. Data on plant growth and severity of root-knot were recorded. It was found that treatment of soil with the nematicides and <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> gave significant reduction in gall indices and in numbers of galls and females in roots. Higher dosage corresponded to better control of the disease. Complete elimination of root-knot was achieved with only the treatment with highest dosage of sodium azide.

Previous researches proved the efficacy of DPA in suppressing certain pathogens that are deleterious to the plants in the rhizosphere. DPA production was statistical optimized by amending non-edible <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> in growing media as nitrogen and sugars (Dextrose, Glucose, and Lactose) as carbon source. Plackett-Burman design (PBD), indicated that Jatropha cake, Karanja cake, and Dextrose were the most significant components (p < 0. 05) of the media and were further optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). Jatropha cake, Karanja cake, and Dextrose at the concentration of 12. 5, 4. 5, and 10 g/l, respectively, yielded 250 mg/l of DPA, which was 2. 5 fold more than that obtained from basal medium. HPLC analysis of the optimized medium (peak at retention time of 30 min) confirmed the enhanced DPA production by P. variotii. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that optimized medium impose a stress like condition (due to less C:N ratio) for the fungus and generated more spores as compared to the basal medium in which carbon source is easily available for the mycelial growth. The antimicrobial activity of the fungal extract was tested and found to be effective even at 10 − 2 dilution after 72 h against two plant pathogens, Fusarium oxysporum and Verticillium dahlia. Statistical experimental design of this study and the use of non-edible <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> as a substrate offer an efficient and viable approach for DPA production by P. variotii...|$|R
