5|$|Among some Betsimisaraka it is {{considered}} fady for a brother {{to shake hands with}} his sister, or for young men to wear shoes during their father's lifetime. Among many Betsimisaraka, the eel {{is considered}} sacred. It is forbidden to touch, fish <b>or</b> <b>eat</b> eel. Although many coastal Malagasy communities have a fady against the consumption of pork, this is not universal or common among the Betsimisaraka, who often keep pigs in their villages.|$|E

This {{required}} treatments necessitating the removal of his lower jaw, which cost him the ability to speak <b>or</b> <b>eat</b> normally. His ability to write remained unimpaired, and he continued to publish frequently both online and in print until his death on April 4, 2013.|$|E
5000|$|Environmental - simple {{issues such}} as {{inconsistent}} meal times can cause a feeding <b>or</b> <b>eating</b> disorder. Giving the child food {{that they are not}} developmentally acquired for can also cause these disorders.

5|$|Gignac {{and colleagues}} also noted, however, that bone {{puncture}} marks from Deinonychus are relatively rare, and unlike larger theropods with many known puncture marks like Tyrannosaurus, Deinonychus {{probably did not}} frequently bite through <b>or</b> <b>eat</b> bone. Instead, they probably used their high bite force in defense or prey capture, rather than feeding.|$|E
5|$|Lebrón took upon {{herself the}} {{responsibility}} {{of taking care of}} her father. She would travel to a nearby town to buy medicines for her father which she gave him every seventy minutes. For seven days she didn't sleep <b>or</b> <b>eat</b> while attending him. Following his death Lebrón began working by weaving clothes.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur {{during which the}} character of the call changes. The female mounts the male and a single spermatophore is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's oviduct over a period of a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove <b>or</b> <b>eat</b> the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E

5|$|Fruit is rich {{in sugar}} but {{deficient}} in other nutrients, {{so it must be}} eaten in large quantities. Bohemian waxwings have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Waxwings often drink water <b>or</b> <b>eat</b> snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, the fruits are juicier and water is less of a problem.|$|E
5|$|Phagocytosis is an {{important}} feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, <b>or</b> <b>eat,</b> pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved {{as a means of}} acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.|$|E
5|$|The aye-aye {{is almost}} universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar, though the tales vary from village to village and region to region. If people see an aye-aye, they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road {{outside of town}} (so others can carry the bad {{fortunes}} away) or burn their village and move. The superstitions behind aye-aye fady include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or people, that they kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein, that they embody ancestral spirits, or that they warn of illness, death, or bad luck in the family. As of 1970, {{the people of the}} Marolambo District in the Toamasina Province feared the aye-aye because they believed it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, <b>or</b> <b>eat</b> one.|$|E

25|$|Methcathinone binges {{resemble}} amphetamine binges in {{that the}} user may not sleep <b>or</b> <b>eat,</b> and takes in {{little in the way}} of liquids. The methcathinone binge is followed by long periods of sleep, excess eating, long-lasting nosebleeds (insufflation of methcathinone is corrosive to the nasal mucosa in the same manner as its methamphetamine counterpart) and, in some cases, depression.|$|E

25|$|Pica is a {{condition}} in which animals chew <b>or</b> <b>eat</b> unusual things such as fabric, plastic or wool. In cats, this is mostly harmless as they do not digest most of it, but can be fatal or require surgical removal if a large amount of foreign material is ingested (for example, an entire sock). It tends to occur more often in Burmese, Oriental, Siamese and breeds with these in their ancestry.|$|E
25|$|USS Tantalus (ARL-27) {{was one of}} 39 Achelous-class {{landing craft}} repair ships built for the United States Navy during World War II.

25|$|So {{far this}} looks like simple {{parasitism}} by the ants, as if they simply {{take advantage of the}} plant for food and shelter. However, the plant also benefits greatly from this relationship. With the help of their traps and predation, the ants defend the plant from other insects and parasitic plants. Any insect that may kill <b>or</b> <b>eat</b> the plant is quickly captured and killed by the ants, which is also to their own benefit.|$|E
