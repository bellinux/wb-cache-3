40|$|This paper {{describes}} the improved removal of impurities (coating, ink/toner) from <b>offset</b> <b>prints</b> produced by digital printing of two-side coated paper. The substrates were printed by conventional and digital offset processes. Based on image analysis results it was established that deinking flotation is an inefficient method for ink particle removal from digital <b>offset</b> <b>printed</b> paper, {{but it is}} efficient for ink removal from conventional <b>offset</b> <b>printed</b> paper. On the other hand, pre-treatment with hydrogen peroxide solution gives better results for ink particle removal from digital <b>offset</b> <b>prints</b> than from conventional <b>offset</b> <b>prints.</b> Optimal parameters for hydrogen peroxide pre-treatment for both <b>offset</b> <b>prints</b> were chosen based on unprinted substrate mass loss results in the preliminary investigation. These results showed that hydrogen peroxide pre-treatment is more successful at removal of impurities in comparison with flotation deinking without pre-treatment...|$|R

40|$|For this research, {{the image}} quality {{attributes}} of <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> versus screen printing methods for providing high-resolution premium products, such as plastic key chains, were investigated. The three substrates investigated were Polypropylene (PP), Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and Polyester (PET). Optical properties, such as dot gain, solid ink density, ink trapping, tone reproduction and print contrast, were analyzed through color measurement and visual evaluation. In addition, the end-use applications were tested using adhesion tests, water resistance tests, and heat resistance tests {{to make certain}} that the final product achieve the best quality print and meets end-use requirements. The results of this research showed that <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> can be used in place of screen printing to produce premium products. According to the research results, solid ink density, ink trapping, and print contrast on screen printed sheets show better results than <b>offset</b> <b>printed</b> sheets. However, the screen printed sheets had lower dot gain results than the <b>offset</b> <b>printed</b> sheets. Although the screen printed sheets appeared to give better optical properties than the <b>offset</b> <b>printed</b> sheet, the tone reproduction curves showed that the <b>offset</b> <b>printed</b> sheet had better visual image quality than the screen printed sheet. The results of the survey, which asked candidates to compare two images (screen <b>printed</b> sheet vs. <b>offset</b> <b>printed</b> sheet), showed {{that the majority of the}} people chose the <b>offset</b> <b>printed</b> sheet more often than the screen printed sheet. This also supports the results of the tone reproduction curves which show that the <b>offset</b> <b>printed</b> sheet produced a higher image quality than the screen printed sheet. The results of the application tests determined that the <b>offset</b> <b>printed</b> sheet withstood all three tests while the screen printed sheet failed the water resistance tests and the adhesion tests...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlcohol free “wet” offset {{technology}} {{is important not}} only for the sake of printers but for a stronger, more profitable business. The optimization of automatic <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> system for the environmentally friendly dampening components via free alcohol and filtration procedures is a further milestone of the classical offset technology environmental approach. <b>Offset</b> <b>printing,</b> also named “wet” offset, uses dampening solution in order to keep non-printing elements as a hydrophilic on the surface of <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> plate. So fountain solution is a part of its process. Generally it is composed by water and around of 8 - 10 % isopropyl alcohol as a surface active agent improved wetting. However, there are inherent issues with this process, such as negative environmental impact, health hazardous, complex press operations and waste water and chemical regulations. Isopropyl alcohol used in water solution in <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> has negative influence as: part of it vaporizes to form volatile organic compounds that pollute the working environment, also toxic and flammable. Measured by volume IPA is the most significant air pollutant in the <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> companies. In the common ecology savings conditions there are alternative ways to reduce or even fully IPA-free printing, lowering costs and risks for health and safety the environment. In web <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> are several possibilities to apply alcohol free dampening solution. In this study for the CSWO (Cold Set Web <b>Offset)</b> <b>printing</b> it was applied fully alcohol free solution with specially developed additive, compatible to individual tap water properties. In addition here was used ceramic filtration system in order to prevent fast contamination and also permit longer intervals between changing the fountain solution and keeps it clean during the long period.
