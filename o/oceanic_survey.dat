40|$|AbstractMany {{methods are}} {{available}} for the measurement of dissolved carbon dioxide in an aqueous environment. Standard titration is the typical field method for measuring dissolved CO 2 in aquaculture systems. However, titrimetric determination of dissolved CO 2 in marine water aquaculture systems is unsuitable {{because of the high}} dissolved solids, silicates, and other dissolved minerals that interfere with the determination. Other methods used to measure dissolved carbon dioxide in an aquaculture water included use of a wetted CO 2 probe analyzer, standard nomographic methods, and calculation by direct measurements of the water's pH, temperature, and alkalinity. The determination of dissolved CO 2 in saltwater based on partial pressure measurements and non-dispersive infra-red (NDIR) techniques with a CO 2 gas analyzer are widely employed for <b>oceanic</b> <b>surveys</b> of surface ocean CO 2 flux and are similar to the techniques employed with the head space unit (HSU) in this study. Dissolved carbon dioxide (DC) determination with the HSU using a infra-red gas analyzer (IRGA) was compared with titrimetric, nomographic, calculated, and probe measurements of CO 2 in freshwater and in saltwater with a salinity ranging from 5. 0 to 30 ppt, and a CO 2 range from 8 to 50 mg/L. Differences in CO 2 measurements between duplicate HSUs (0. 1 – 0. 2 mg/L) were not statistically significant different. The coefficient of variation for the HSU readings averaged 1. 85 % which was better than the CO 2 probe (4. 09 %) and that for the titrimetric method (5. 84 %). In all low, medium and high salinity level trials HSU precision was good, averaging 3. 39 %. Differences existed between comparison testing of the CO 2 probe and HSU measurements with the CO 2 probe readings, on average, providing DC estimates that were higher than HSU estimates. Differences between HSU and titration based estimates of DC increased with salinity and reached a maximum at 32. 2 ppt. These differences were statistically significant (P< 0. 05) at all salinity levels greater than 0. 3 ppt.

Quantitative aspects of the vertical and horizontal distributions are presented. The species belonging to the genera Bentheuphausia and Thysanopoda are typically deep-living. Bentheuphausia ambloyops, Thysanopoda cornuta, and T. egregia are widely ranging bathypelagic species, the adults of which inhabit depths greater than 1, 500 meters. Of the ten genera, six (Thysanopoda, Euphausia, Thysanoessa, Nematoscelis, Nematobrachion, and Stylocheiron) contain some species that inhabit a mesopelagic zone between depths of about 500 and 1, 500 meters and other species that are characteristically epipelagic, living mainly above 500 – 700 meters. The epipelagic species are designated in accord with the analogous water masses inhabited. The Pacific water masses are (1) subarctic, situated {{to the north of the}} North Pacific Drift, including only the northern part of the California Current (typical species: Thysanoessa longipes, Tessarabrachion oculatus); (2) transitionzone, including the cooler part of the California Current south of 40 °– 45 ° N. and a belt extending westward to Japan in the region of the North Pacific Drift (typical species: Thysanoessa gregaria, Nematoscelis difficilis); (3) central, occupying the oceanic gyrals of mid-latitudes 15 °– 40 ° in both hemispheres (typical species: Nematoscelis atlantica, Euphausia brevis); and (4) equatorial, occupying a broad tropical belt in the eastern Pacific and a narrower belt to the west (typical species: Euphausia diomediae, E. distinguenda). Equatorial species occupy equatorial water masses in the Pacific and Indian oceans. A zone occupied by the transition-zone species Thysanoessa gregaria and Nematoscelis megalops (corresponding to N. difficilis of the Northern Hemisphere) occurs near 35 °– 45 ° S. Subantarctic and antarctic species are found south of the Subantarctic Convergence. The composite range of a tropical western Pacific group of species (e. g., Euphausia pseudogibba, E. fallax, E. sibogae) extends eastward across the Pacific in a zone 10 °– 20 ° S., while an eastern tropical group (e. g., Euphausia distinguenda, E. eximia) extends westward in a tongue having an axis near 10 ° N. Ekman’s zones of the Pacific littoral fauna each have a counterpart species in the coastal or boundary euphausiid fauna.

40|$|Recent {{analyses}} of the geomagnetic reversal sequence have led to different conclusions regarding the important question of {{whether there is a}} discernible difference between the properties of the two polarity states. The main differences between the two most recent studies are the statistical analyses and the possibility of an additional 57 reversal events in the Cenozoic. These additional events occur predominantly during reverse polarity time, but it is unlikely that all of them represent true reversal events. Nevertheless the question of the relative stabilities of the polarity states is examined in detail, both for the case when all 57 "events" are included in the reversal chronology and when they are all excluded. It is found {{that there is not a}} discernible difference between the stabilities of the two polarity states in either case. Inclusion of these short events does, however, change the structure of the non-stationarity in reversal rate, but still allows a smooth non-stationarity. Only 7 of the 57 short events are pre- 38 Ma, but the evidence suggests that this is a real geomagnetic phenomenon rather than degradation of the magnetic recording or a bias in observation. This could be tested by detailed magnetostratigraphic and <b>oceanic</b> magnetic <b>surveys</b> of the Paleogene and Late Cretaceous. Overall it would appear that the present geomagnetic polarity timescale for 0 – 160 Ma is probably a very good representation of the actual history, and that different timescales and additional events now represent only changes in detail...|$|R

Most predictive models {{show that this}} dynamic topography has peak amplitudes of about ± 2 km, dominated by wavelengths of 10 $^ 4 $ km. Here, we test these models against our comprehensive observational database of 2, 120 spot measurements of dynamic topography that were determined by analysing <b>oceanic</b> seismic <b>surveys.</b> These accurate measurements have typical peak amplitudes of ± 1 km and wavelengths of approximately 10 $^ 3 $ km, and are combined with limited continental constraints to generate a global spherical harmonic model, the robustness {{of which has been}} carefully tested and benchmarked. Our power spectral analysis reveals significant discrepancies between observed and predicted dynamic topography. At longer wavelengths (such as 10 $^ 4 $ km), observed dynamic topography has peak amplitudes of about ± 500 m. At shorter wavelengths (such as 10 $^ 3 $ km), significant dynamic topography is still observed. We show that these discrepancies can be explained if short-wavelength dynamic topography is generated by temperature-driven density anomalies within a sub-plate asthenospheric channel. Stratigraphic observations from adjacent continental margins show that these dynamic topographic signals evolve quickly with time. More rapid temporal and spatial changes in vertical displacement of the Earth's surface have direct consequences for fields as diverse as mantle flow, oceanic circulation and long-term climate change.

40|$|Remote polar and {{deepwater}} fish faunas {{are under}} pressure from ongoing climate change and increasing fishing effort. However, these fish communities are difficult to monitor for logistic and financial reasons. Currently, monitoring of marine fishes largely relies on invasive techniques such as bottom trawling, and on official reporting of global catches, which can be unreliable. Thus, there is need for alternative and non-invasive techniques for qualitative and quantitative <b>oceanic</b> fish <b>surveys.</b> Here we report environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of seawater samples from continental slope depths in Southwest Greenland. We collected seawater samples at depths of 188 – 918 m and compared seawater eDNA to catch data from trawling. We used Illumina sequencing of PCR products to demonstrate that eDNA reads show equivalence to fishing catch data obtained from trawling. Twenty-six families were found with both trawling and eDNA, while three families were found only with eDNA and two families were found only with trawling. Key commercial fish species for Greenland were the most abundant species in both eDNA reads and biomass catch, and interpolation of eDNA abundances between sampling sites showed good correspondence with catch sizes. Environmental DNA sequence reads from the fish assemblages correlated with biomass and abundance data obtained from trawling. Interestingly, the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) showed high abundance of eDNA reads despite only a single specimen being caught, demonstrating {{the relevance of the}} eDNA approach for large species that can probably avoid bottom trawls in most cases. Quantitative detection of marine fish using eDNA remains to be tested further to ascertain whether this technique is able to yield credible results for routine application in fisheries.

These new bathymetric and associated measurements will gradually replace the existing non-uniform coverage of surface vessel track and area data, currently combined with uniform but low resolution altimeter-derived depths. The objective is to produce a world ocean database at least {{an order of magnitude}} better in resolution than what exists over much of the world ocean. Currently, the only established international structure with a worldwide mandate for compiling bathymetric data is GEBCO (General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, jointly sponsored by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO and the International Hydrographic Organization). GEBCO continually updates its world ocean maps and grids of depths by incorporating regional maps produced in the IBC (International Bathymetric Chart), localized maps resulting from research projects, data assembled by scientific data groups such as LDEO 2 ̆ 7 s Marine Geoscience Data System, track data submitted to world and national data centers, and inshore data collected by Hydrographic Offices for navigational purposes. Further multibeam data is expected to come from Coastal States who have undertaken mapping of their juridical Continental Shelf to satisfy the requirements of UNCLOS Article 76. This acoustic data is combined with satellite altimetry data to produce maps that have a horizontal resolution that is in places hundreds of meters but over extensive areas no better than approximately 28 km. In other words, the fabric of the world ocean floor is known and portrayed to highly variable resolution. This means that while the first-order plate tectonic/volcanic seafloor fabric (fracture zones, rift valleys, large seamounts and igneous plateaus) is captured for the entire ocean, second order features like abyssal hills, fault-controlled escarpments, lava flows, propagating rift tips, volcanic rift zones, deep-sea channels, mud volcanoes, emergent diapirs, landslide scars and debris flows, pockmarks, and iceberg plowmarks are know only in a few limited areas. Although vigorous efforts have produced maps of high resolution in some areas, there is at present no coherent plan to collect data that would bring the rest of the ocean up to the level of knowledge that is achievable. We solicit interest in organizing an international workshop that would produce a long-term plan to measure depths and associated data in a systematic fashion in the vast <b>oceanic</b> regions sparsely <b>surveyed</b> by surface ships. To meet this ambitious objective, this international project will need to be carefully designed to optimize return of information balanced against economical use of ship time. Societal benefits will include improved assessment of seafloor/subbottom geological resources, geohazard risk (earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanism and submarine landslides), fin and shellfish habitats, submarine cable routing, and navigational hazards. Science will gain understanding of the complex processes that shape and modify the ocean floor and subbottom, including the influence of bottom topography on circulation and the seafloor 2 ̆ 7 s role as benthic biosphere host. Exciting discoveries will attract follow-up academic studies, e. g. with AUVs, sampling, and sea-floor observatories...|$|R
