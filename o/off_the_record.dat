Other groups such as the American Diabetes Association pointed out that King, known for having weight issues and poorly controlled diabetes, was a questionable spokesperson for a burger chain that sells products that are not part of a healthier diet. Finally, several firms complained <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> that King was inconsistent in his endorsements, selling a highly fattening product while similarly endorsing diabetic products manufactured by the Johnson & Johnson company.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, Copeland {{became a}} key figure in an alleged steroid ring and drug investigation. On March 19, Sports Illustrated posted an article on its website in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Copeland, who was alleged to have obtained HGH. Copeland has previously admitted to using steroids in April 2004 after neck surgery as an experiment on TSN's <b>Off</b> <b>The</b> <b>Record</b> with Michael Landsberg in January 2005. He said, he felt it slowed him down, so he quickly got off the substance. According to Copeland, he took HGH after returning from a spinal fusion neck surgery. He was told by doctors that it would help the bones grow back around the screws and plate that were inserted into his neck. He claims to have taken blood tests, consulted doctors, studied the drug, and got prescriptions before deciding to take them.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1900s and early 2000s, baseball's {{position}} compared to football in the United States moved in contradictory directions. In 2008, Major League Baseball set a revenue record of $6.5billion, matching the NFL's {{revenue for the}} first time in decades. A new MLB revenue record of $6.6 billion was set in 2009. On the other hand, the percentage of American sports fans polled who named baseball as their favorite sport was 16%, compared to pro football at 31%. In 1985, the respective figures were pro football 24%, baseball 23%. Because there are so many more major league games played, there is no comparison in overall attendance. In 2008, total attendance at major league games was the second-highest in history: 78.6 million, 0.7% <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> set the previous year. The following year, amid the U.S. recession, attendance fell by 6.6% to 73.4 million. Attendance at games held under the Minor League Baseball umbrella also set a record in 2007, with 42.8 million; this figure does not include attendance at games of the several independent minor leagues.|$|E
5|$|Under pressure, he {{was adamant}} {{that he was}} unaware of the current {{whereabouts}} of the vessels or their crews and that he had never killed anyone; his testimony was corroborated by the other pirates. However, according to a letter sent to Hezekiah Niles' Weekly Register Cofresí admitted <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> that he had killed nearly 400 people (but no Puerto Ricans). The pirate also confessed that he burned the cargo of an American vessel to throw off the authorities. The defendants' social status and association with criminal (or outlaw) elements dictated the course of events. Captain José Madrazo served as judge and prosecutor of the one-day trial. Governor Miguel de la Torre may have influenced the process, negotiating with Madrazo beforehand. On July 14, 1825, U.S. Congressman Samuel Smith accused Secretary of State Henry Clay of pressuring the Spanish governor to execute the pirates.|$|E

25|$|Among Beith's later {{works were}} several war histories, {{which were not}} as well {{received}} as his comic fiction and plays.

25|$|After {{leaving the}} War Office, Beith {{published}} several volumes of war histories, but his habitual light and witty prose was widely thought unsuited to so grave a subject. In 1947 his only serious play, Hattie Stowe {{was presented at}} the Embassy Theatre, Swiss Cottage, London. The play was a biographical study of Harriet Beecher Stowe; it was respectfully reviewed, but made little impact. In the same year he had one of his greatest successes, with <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Record</b> (co-written with Stephen King-Hall), which ran for 702 performances.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{exceeding}} {{temperature at}} Near Field Transducer (NFT) is a mandatory issue in Heat Assist Magnetic Recording (HAMR). It significantly affects both system performance and lifetime. We believe that light reflection <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> medium {{could contribute to}} the temperature rise in the NFT. In this paper, we study light behavior from the NFT output to the media in terms of powers, using 3 -D simulation. We found that <b>the</b> light reflection <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> layer has certain effects on media absorption rate and NFT coupling efficiency. An increase in the NFT temperature is partly induced by the reflected light. When the surface roughness is included, the reflected power to the NFT obviously decreases. The average absorption rate is reduced more than 50 %. The maximum absorption rate and smallest coupling efficiency occurs at the roughness Ra = 0. 55 nm...|$|R

McChrystal was not quoted as being directly critical of {{the president or the}} president's policies, but several comments from his aides in the article reflected their perception of McChrystal's disappointment with Obama on their first two occasions of meeting. According to Rolling Stone, McChrystal's staff was contacted prior to release of the article and did not deny the validity of the article, although senior members of his staff dispute this, and have accused Hastings in Army Times of exaggerating the seniority of aides quoted and breaking the <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> trust of private conversations between him and the aides. Hastings told Newsweek that he was quite clearly a reporter gathering material, and actually bemused at the degree to which soldiers freely spoke to him.|$|E
