40|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of Nd-YAG lasers compared to CO 2 lasers consists of easy beam handling using optical silica fibers. However, up to now Nd-YAG applications for material processing were limited due to a rather low available mean <b>output</b> <b>power</b> (<b>less</b> than about 500 W). A Eureka project (termed "EU- 226 ") which consequently aimed at developing the so called "High Power Solid State Laser (HPSSL) " capable of 1 to 3 kW, involved absorptivity studies results of which are given in this contribution. Metallic surfaces exhibit a higher absorptivity at 1. 06 µm (Nd-YAG) than at 10. 6 µm which improves the energy transfer with a Nd-YAG laser and decreases the thermal runaway. This was acertained by measurements of absorptivity {{as a function of}} temperature and by thermal cycle calculations. This permits laser surface hardening of steels without any coating or gas shielding, which prevents in particular pollution.

40|$|A {{concept of}} a {{high-power}} magnetron transmitter for operation within a wideband control feedback loop in phase and amplitude is presented. This transmitter is proposed to drive Superconducting RF (SRF) cavities for intensity-frontier GeV-scale proton/ion linacs. The transmitter performance at the dynamic control was verified in experiments with CW, S-Band, 1 kW magnetrons. The wideband control of magnetrons, required for the superconducting linacs, was realized using the magnetrons, injection-locked by the phase-modulated signals. The capabilities of the magnetrons injection-locked by the phase-modulated signals and adequateness for feeding of SRF cavities were verified by measurements of the transfer function magnitude characteristics of single and 2 -cascade magnetrons, by measurements the magnetrons phase performance and by measurements of spectra of the carrier frequency. At the ratio of power of locking signal to <b>output</b> <b>power</b> <b>less</b> than - 13 dB (in 2 -cascade scheme per magnetron, respectively) we demonstrated a phase modulation bandwidth of over 1. 0 MHz. The carrier frequency spectrum width about of 1 Hz at the level less than - 60 dBc did not demonstrate broadening at wide range of magnitude and frequency of the phase modulation of the injection-locking signal. The wideband dynamic control of output power of the transmitter model was first experimentally demonstrated using two magnetrons, combined in power and injection-locked by the phase-modulated signals. The experiments with the injection-locked magnetrons adequately emulated the wideband dynamic control with a feedback control system, which will allow suppressing all known parasitic modulation of the accelerating field in the SRF cavities. The magnetron transmitter concept, tests of the setups and injection-locking of magnetrons by phase-modulated signals are discussed in this work. Comment: 12 pages, 19 figure...|$|E
40|$|Pulse width {{modulation}} (PWM) rectifiers are extensively used in battery charger, regulated {{dc voltage}} source, UPS systems, ac line conditioner and motor drives. The conventional control schemes for these rectifiers require PLL, transformations, and input voltage sensing, which increase {{the cost and}} complexity of the controller. Simple control schemes based on resistance emulation control are developed in this thesis work for different PWM boost rectifiers. Modeling, analysis and design methods for these rectifier systems are presented. The effect of computational delay involved in digital implementation on the performance of the above rectifier systems is studied. A single-switch boost rectifier system is presented, which operates in DCM and in CCM for an <b>output</b> <b>power</b> <b>less</b> than and greater than 50 % rated load, respectively, exploiting the best features of both the operating modes. A generalized feedforward control is presented to improve the dynamic response of output voltage of single-phase boost rectifiers against input voltage, load current and reference voltage disturbances. Feedforward control requires additional voltage and/or current measurements. A state observer is presented for estimating the inductor current of a buck rectifier, and two disturbance observers are presented to estimate the input voltage and the load current of a boost rectifier. These observers eliminate the need of additional sensors for implementing the feedforward control. The resistance emulation control is extended to four-wire PWM rectifier. Two control methods are presented. The first method makes the input currents of the rectifier proportional to their respective input voltages, while the second one balances its input currents even under unbalanced input voltage condition. A detailed analysis of line and neutral current distortions of four-wire converter is presented. A three-carrier based PWM scheme is presented, which significantly reduces the neutral current of the rectifier compared to conventional PWM scheme, when three single-phase inductors are used, and considerably reduces both line and neutral current distortions, when a three-limb inductor is used. A regenerative test setup containing two back-to-back connected three-phase PWM converters is presented for testing high-power converters in the active and reactive power circulation mode. The proposed scheme considerably reduces the cost of testing, and hence, the overall production cost of the converters compared to load-bank testing. A mathematical model is presented for the above system. A suitable control method is presented to control the two converters of the back-to-back system. A new PWM scheme is presented, which considerably reduces the requirement of the dc bus voltage of the back-to-back system compared to conventional PWM schemes. All theoretical predictions are experimentally validated. The experimental results are presented...|$|E
