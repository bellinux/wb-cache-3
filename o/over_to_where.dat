25|$|The Hotel Northern wasn't {{the only}} {{business}} making a fortune from railway construction. At least four brothels {{were built in}} South Fort George during this era and one Madam, Irene Jordan, did so well that she decided to expand her business into Central Fort George and built a large house there, the first two-piano brothel in Northern British Columbia. However, {{it turned out that}} Central Fort George did not want a brothel in their town and it was shut down by Police Chief Dunwoody. But the story would not end there. Undeterred, Miss Jordan had the new brothel skidded <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> the Prince George townsite was being built and the house was later rented by Prince George's first mayor, WG Gillette, to be the Prince George City Hall. Another public outcry erupted and the local newspaper editors had a grand time making jokes and drawing cartoons about this arrangement, until the mayor and the city council moved out into a new City Hall.|$|E
25|$|On {{receipt of}} this news Menéndez sent Diego Flores in advance with forty {{soldiers}} to reconnoitre the French position; he {{himself with the}} chaplain, some officers, and twenty soldiers rejoined Flores at about midnight, and pushed forward {{to the side of}} the inlet opposite their encampment. The following morning, having concealed his men in the thicket, Menéndez dressed himself in a French costume with a cape over his shoulder, and, carrying a short lance in his hand, went out and showed himself on the river-bank, accompanied by one of his French prisoners, in order to convince the castaways by his boldness that he was well supported. The Frenchmen soon observed him, and one of their number swam <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> he was standing. Throwing himself at his feet the Frenchman explained who they were and begged the Admiral to grant him and his comrades a safe conduct to Fort Caroline, as they were not at war with Spaniards.|$|E
500|$|During {{the casting}} process, Keamy was {{described}} as a military type in his late-twenties who does not question orders. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN wrote that [...] "in a show that features characters fraught with uncertainty, Keamy is the polar opposite and his Marine mentality definitely sets him apart. [...] His team has a physical advantage {{and with the help of}} Mr. Widmore, they have a tactical advantage as well. [...] Keamy is like a bulldog being thrown into a cage full of kittens (except for [...] Sayid)". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post, stated that [...] "Keamy is Crazy! … out of all the bad guys on the Island—past, present, and future—Keamy has to be one of the most dangerous ones. [...] Not because of how big he is, or the weaponry, but his willingness to kill at the drop of a hat. [...] That doesn't bode well for our Losties [...]" [...] Co-show runner/executive producer/writer Carlton Cuse has stated that he and the other writers create [...] "complex" [...] characters because they [...] "are interested in exploring how good and evil can be embodied in the same characters and [...] the struggles we all have to overcome the dark parts of our souls"; however, he later clarified that there is an exception: [...] "Keamy's bad, he knows he's bad, but he's ... a guy that does the job." [...] Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "the great thing about Keamy is that he is like a ... merciless survivor. [...] 's this great moment [...] where he just sort of hackie-sacks [...] <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> [...] Omar is standing. [...] Omar is certainly an acceptable casualty as far as Keamy is concerned." [...] According to a featurette in the Lost: The Complete Fourth Season – The Expanded Experience DVD set, Keamy likes [...] "heavy weaponry" [...] and [...] "physical fitness" [...] and dislikes [...] "negotiations" [...] and [...] "doctors".|$|E

2500|$|The two {{perpetrators}} returned, both [...] "walking with a swagger" [...] {{to where}} McIlwaine waited downhill from the parked car with Burcombe. McIlwaine {{at that moment}} made an attempt to run away but Brown, Dillon, and Burcombe {{caught up with him}} as he fell to the ground. Brown gave him a severe kicking, mostly in the head. Dillon produced a butcher's knife and cut McIlwaine's throat while Brown shouted encouragement and Burcombe overlooked the scene from about five feet away. Brown and Dillon left McIlwaine still breathing on the ground; once they were back inside the car, Brown proposed to drive the car over his head, but Dillon dissuaded him. Brown halted the vehicle, took the knife and walked back <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> McIlwaine was lying on the road making a [...] "wheezing" [...] sound. Brown stabbed McIlwaine repeatedly in the face and chest. When he noticed that McIlwaine appeared to be looking up at him, Brown stabbed him deeply in his left eye; the wound penetrated his brain, killing him. According to Burcombe's later testimony, Brown appeared [...] "crazed" [...] as he handed the knife back to Dillon and said he was [...] "buzzing"; he subsequently went on to recount stabbing McIlwaine in the eye. He threatened to cut Burcombe's throat or kill a member of his family if he told anyone what happened.|$|E
2500|$|Fortunately for the Union, four of {{the rebel}} ships {{grounded}} when the tide lowered that morning. At 1:45 am, Commodore Mitchell and his men finished clearing the obstructions so he steamed the Fredericksburg back <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> the remaining ships were anchored. It was then that Mitchell discovered the Virginia II, the Richmond, the Drewry, and the Scorpion were all resting on the river bottom {{and could not be}} freed until high tide which would come at about 11:00 am. The situation was complicated further at day break when the Union batteries started to become more accurate. The Richmond was hit repeatedly by artillery rounds but her armor protected her from serious damage. It was different for the unarmored gunboats, because these ships were mainly wooden vessels, they were [...] "torn to pieces" [...] by enemy fire. Drewry was so heavily damaged that her crew abandoned ship just in time because fifteen minutes later, at 6:55 am, a round from one of the batteries ignited the vessel's powder magazine. Instantly the gunboat exploded violently and sank. The large shock wave also heavily damaged the nearby Scorpion which had to be abandoned as well. Two men were killed on the torpedo boat and it sank along with the Drewry. To make matters worse for Commodore Mitchell, at 10:30 am lookouts spotted the Onondaga, the two gunboats, and the Spuyten Duyvil heading for them.|$|E
