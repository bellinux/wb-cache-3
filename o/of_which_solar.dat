The experiment is conducted at the skyradiometer site which is situated at Saga University. There is Ariake Sea near the Saga University. It is rather difficult to estimate surface reflectance of the sea surface because the reflectance is too low in comparison to that of land surface. In order to improve surface reflectance estimation accuracy, atmospheric correction is mandated. Atmospheric correction method is also proposed by using skyradiometer data.

When examining the zones where the topside layer appeared, the occurrence rate of the topside layer was low at the areas with a strong Martian crustal magnetic field as observed by the Mars global surveyor.

However, the energy storage buffer for harvested solar energy should be adaptive to the sporadic nature of the diurnal solar radiation availability. We believe that the typical fixed battery models no longer apply in harvesting enabled sensors. Therefore, we propose a random walk based stochastic model namely; Trinomial Random Walk (TRW) model for the storage capacity of harvesting enabled sensors. We then apply the proposed model on a comprehensive solar radiation data set of four different locations around the globe. Our performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model better analyze the sporadic nature of the diurnal solar radiation availability for estimating the required storage capacity. We further investigate an optimal power consumption value for a given energy store size, such that the utilization of harvested energy is maximized and the probability of energy depletion is minimized. For a given energy harvesting scenario, our model better approximates the optimal load with probability of up to a maximum of 98 %, compared to a maximum of 37 % for the binomial random walk model...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn these days, the {{application}} of using thermal energy of sunlight has become widely used in concentrated solar power generation systems (CSP). In CSP, property of the receiver directly contributes to the system efficiency of CSP. The solar selective absorber {{is used for the}} receiver to reduce energy loss of thermal radiation. To investigate the mass production technology of fabricating solar selective absorber that can be utilized in high temperature condition, we focused on transparent conductive oxides (TCO) thin film on metal substrate. TCO material has plasma wavelength in infrared region. Therefore the electromagnetic wave with shorter wavelength than plasma wavelength goes through the material, while the electromagnetic wave with longer wavelength is reflected on the surface. It is realized that TCO on metal substrate showed high performance as solar selective absorbers, i. e. high absorptance in visible light range and low emittance in infrared range by numerical simulations. The optical property of fabricated TCO coated metal is well consistent with the simulated property. Consequently, we attain high performance solar selective absorber <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>solar</b> absorptance is 0. 71 and hemispherical total emittance is 0. 11.

Strong incentives towards sustainable solutions in both of these fields have led to the design of innovative, multifaceted solutions, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>solar</b> road panels {{are one of the most}} recent entrants. This research presents some initial analysis into the design of solar road panels from the perspective of Canadian pavement engineering. The hypothesis of this research was as follows: A specially designed modular panel can be constructed to withstand the structural and environmental loads on Canadian pavement structures while simultaneously generating electricity through embedded photovoltaic cells. Through a process that covers the design, construction, and analysis of the structural elements of a solar road panel prototype, this research evaluated the impact that solar road panels can have for Canada’s pavement infrastructure. Specific elements researched include the material selection for such a panel, the flexural response of the composite structure, how the panel will interact with traditional pavement and geotechnical materials while in use, and the change in performance of transparent layer materials as they are subjected to freeze-thaw cycling and scaling. The research found that the initial prototype design included a two 10 -mm tempered glass pane transparent layers with a 12. 7 -mm GPO- 3 optical layer and 19. 1 -mm GPO- 3 base layer. The concept being that the glass would provide the rigidity required to protect the fragile solar cells while the fiberglass laminate has demonstrated performance as a traffic-supporting material in adverse conditions. Testing of this structure found that the performance was easily duplicated through finite element analysis, given that the material properties were assumed to be more rigid than the averages for tempered glass and GPO- 3. Further finite element analysis demonstrated that the prototype solar road panel would not fail through traditional fatiguing methods, and in all cases on concrete, asphalt, granular, and subgrade bases the panels improved the performance characteristics of the structural base. The environmental conditioning of acrylic, glass, and polycarbonate specimens demonstrated that glass is the ideal material choice for the transparent layer for Canadian solar road panels. It proved to have the greatest freeze-thaw and scaling resistance of the three materials, and while the friction characteristic of the flat glass samples would not be suitable for driving on, avenues of research were identified that could improve this characteristic. In summary, the research conducted clearly proved the hypothesis; it is possible to build a structure that can house a photovoltaic system while supporting the structural and environmental loads that Canadian pavement are exposed to. The ideal panel would be constructed with a tempered glass transparent layer, GPO- 3 optical and base layers, and the structure would be installed on a concrete structural base. The refinement of this design will be the scope for future research...|$|E
