5|$|In 1904, Coolsma {{published}} a {{revised version of}} his grammar. Working with fellow missionary Christiaan Albers, who had also preached in Cianjur, Coolsma {{published a}} Dutch-Sundanese dictionary in 1911; {{this was followed by}} a revised version of his Sundanese-Dutch dictionary in 1913. Coolsma's wife died on 27 September 1917. Her death led him to reduce his workload, although he found time to publish his memoirs, Terugblik op mijn levensweg, 1840–1924 (Looking Back <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>Life,</b> 1840–1924), in 1924. He died two years later, on 20 March 1926.|$|E

In turn, Cage {{filed a lawsuit against}} Turner and her book publisher in the UK who took an excerpt from the book and posted it on their website (pre-publication). Cage argued defamation and damage to character and won the case, resulting in retractions, legal fees, and a donation to charity.|$|E

In it she said [...] "I look back <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> like a good day's work, it was done and I feel satisfied with it. I was happy and contented, I knew nothing better and made {{the best out of}} what life offered. And life is what we make it, always has been, always will be."

500|$|Elias Kifle Maraim Beyene, a {{survivor}} from Ethiopia being {{asked about his}} memory of Michael Jackson after his death remembers: [...] "I won't ever forget Michael Jackson because his contribution to the song We are the World had a very significant effect <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I am 50 now but 25 years ago I was living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which {{at that time was}} suffering from a long drought and famine. It was a terrible situation. Lots of people became sick and many more died. Around one million people in all were killed by the famine. In 1984 Michael Jackson, along with a number of other leading musicians, made the song We are the World to raise money for Africa. We received a lot of aid from the world and I {{was one of those who}} directly benefitted from it. The wheat flour that was distributed to the famine victims was different to the usual cereal we bought at the market. We baked a special bread from it. The local people named the bread after the great artist and it became known as Michael Bread. It was soft and delicious.|$|E
500|$|Bondfield {{joined a}} drapery and {{embroidery}} business in Church Road, Hove, where the young apprentices {{were treated as}} family members. Relations between customers and assistants were cordial, and Bondfield's later recollections of this period were uniformly happy. Her apprenticeship complete, {{she worked as a}} living-in assistant in a succession of Brighton drapery stores, where she quickly encountered the realities of shop staff life: unsympathetic employers, very long hours, appalling living conditions and no privacy. Bondfield reported on her experiences of living-in: [...] "Overcrowded, insanitary conditions, poor and insufficient food were the main characteristics of this system, with an undertone of danger... In some houses both natural and unnatural vices found a breeding ground". She found some relief from this environment when she was befriended by a wealthy customer, Louisa Martindale, and her daughter Hilda. The Martindales, socially conscious liberals and advocates for women's rights, found Bondfield a willing learner, and lent her books that began her lifelong interest in labour and social questions. Bondfield described Mrs Martindale as [...] "a most vivid influence <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>life...</b> she put me in the way of knowledge that has been of help to many score of my shop mates".|$|E
500|$|Mitsuda {{slept in}} his studio several nights, and {{attributed}} certain songs, such as [...] "To Far Away Times", to inspiring dreams. He later attributed this song to an idea he was developing before Chrono Trigger, reflecting that the song was made in dedication to [...] "a certain person with whom I wanted to share a generation." [...] Mitsuda tried to use leitmotifs of the Chrono Trigger main theme {{to create a sense}} of consistency in the soundtrack. He also suffered a hard drive crash that lost around forty in-progress tracks. After Mitsuda contracted stomach ulcers, regular Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu joined the project to compose ten songs and finish the score. Mitsuda returned to watch the ending with the staff before the game's release, crying upon seeing the finished scene. Mitsuda considers Chrono Trigger a landmark title which helped mature his talent. While Mitsuda later held that the title piece was [...] "rough around the edges," [...] he maintains that it had [...] "significant influence <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> as a composer." [...] At the time of the game's release, the number of tracks and sound effects was unprecedented, causing the soundtrack to span three discs in its 1995 commercial pressing.|$|E

2500|$|A {{recurring}} theme in Clarke's works {{is the notion}} that the evolution of an intelligent species would eventually make them something close to gods. This was explored in his 1953 novel Childhood's End and briefly touched upon in his novel Imperial Earth. This idea of transcendence through evolution seems to have been influenced by Olaf Stapledon, who wrote a number of books dealing with this theme. Clarke has said of Stapledon's 1930 book Last and First Men that [...] "No other book had a greater influence <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>life...</b> and its successor Star Maker (1937) are the twin summits of [...] literary career".|$|E

She does state in both her book and in the edition of January 3, 2005 of Sci Fi Weekly that the program closely resembles the truth of her own life. Several details of Arquette's character match DuBois's life, such as the name of her husband on the show (Joe) {{and the fact that he}} is an aerospace engineer. [...] Both the character and the real-life Dubois have three daughters, and the first case the character [...] "consults" [...] on in the show's pilot is with the Texas Rangers, the law enforcement agency with whom the real-life DuBois alleges she first worked.|$|E
