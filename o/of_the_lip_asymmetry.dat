30|$|<b>The</b> {{mean value}} <b>of</b> <b>lip</b> canting {{was less than}} 2  mm, which was another {{limitation}} <b>of</b> this study. <b>The</b> mean <b>lip</b> canting value was also reduced from 1.54  mm before surgery to 0.94  mm after surgery. In addition, there were no large differences in <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> slopes before and after surgery (0.70 ° before surgery and 0.56 ° after surgery) and the slopes were also less than 1 °, which was another limitation <b>of</b> this study. <b>The</b> threshold for <b>the</b> recognition <b>of</b> an occlusal cant was suggested to be 4 ° in a 2 D frontal plane study [13, 14]. Most surgeons would agree that an occlusal cant of < 3 °– 4 ° is likely not significant enough to pose a noticeable problem for a lay observer [13]. As such, it seems that <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>lip</b> <b>asymmetry</b> in <b>the</b> frontal plane among this cohort was relatively small at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> occlusal plane. <b>The</b> manifest change at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chin was more substantial but may differentially affect <b>the</b> lower <b>lip</b> soft tissues relative to <b>the</b> upper <b>lip,</b> influencing smiling in a less predictable way [15].

40|$|Most {{theoretical}} descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brass instrument lip-reed {{consider the}} acoustical condition at <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> to be a closed, rigid termination, corresponding to a unitary reflectance. This assumption is carried through to many computational models as well. In reality, <b>the</b> protrusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> player's <b>lips</b> into <b>the</b> mouthpiece causes a periodic shortening/extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acoustical tube downstream, an effect sometimes {{but not always}} incorporated into such models.

It is especially common for vascular anomalies to involve <b>the</b> <b>lip.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lips</b> are a functionally and aesthetically important component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head and neck area. A retrospective analysis of data from our vascular anomaly center was performed in order to understand the characteristics and treatment requirements of vascular anomalies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> and to establish which treatments are likely to lead to the best outcomes. MethodsA retrospective review was performed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medical records <b>of</b> patients diagnosed with vascular anomalies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper or lower lip from January 2001 to September 2013. Using clinical photographs, radiologic findings, and patient records, <b>the</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> each case and <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vascular anomaly were recorded, along with information about treatment and follow-up.

40|$|Abstract__ Orofacial clefting (OFC) is a {{group of}} {{congenital}} malformations characterized by closure defects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip,</b> jaw and/or palate. In general, three subgroups of OFC are distinguished, e. g., isolated clefts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> or <b>the</b> palate and clefts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> and <b>the</b> palate. Based on embryology, <b>the</b> isolated cleft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> and cleft lip together with cleft palate are considered a continuum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same malformation, which will be referred to as cleft lip with or without palate (CL/P). This is in contrast to the isolated cleft palate (CP) which is regarded to be etiologically different. With a live birth prevalence rate of 11. 8 per 10, 000, CL/P is the third most frequent congenital malformation in The Netherlands [1]. This is more than twice as high as the birth prevalence rate of CP of 2. 4 per 10, 000 live births. Figure 1. 1 shows the birth prevalence rates of CL/P and CP in the period from 1999 to 2008.
