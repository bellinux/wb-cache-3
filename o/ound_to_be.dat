40|$|The authors assert hat an {{adequate}} understanding of religious proselytizing {{requires an understanding}} {{not only of the}} converts but also of organizational attempts to recruit them. Maintaining that the proselytizing of outsiders requires contact, bridging, and assimilation mechanisms, they examine the evangelistic efforts and results of 20 proselyte-minded Canadian churches over a five-year period. They find little evidence in evangelistic programs for the existence of such mechanisms f or reaching outsiders. M oreover,new convert members are f <b>ound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> primarily family members, friends, and people from other churches. They conclude that in spite of the apparent failure to proselytize many outsiders, the organizational mechanisms may continue to persist because of the latent functions they serve. Much of the work in the Sociology of Religion relating to the subject of pro-selytism has focused on the individual convert as the unit ofanalysis. Theories and empirical studies have tried to explain proclivity to religious conversion and affiliation in terms of the nature of converts. Thus Glock (1965) has synthesized a long tradition in positing the forms of personal deprivation which serve as sources of religious involvement. 1 Lofland and Stark (1965) have proposed a process theory of conversion which focuses upon the convert and the stages through which he passes on the road to conversion.

In contrast, 7 D 7 B 10 was unable to bind to factor 1 X or bovine protein C. The effect of varying Ca 2 + concentration on the interaction of the antibody with protein C was complex. Low concentrations of Ca 2 + enhanced the formation of the protein C-antibody complex with half-maximal effect occurring at approximately 6 0 PM metal ion. However, higher concentrations of Ca 2 + completely inhibited 7 D 7 B 10 binding to protein C with a K o. o~f 1. 1 mM.

40|$|The {{study of}} multiferroics and in {{particular}} the magnetoelectric couplin g is nowadays a new focus among the many hot topics in physics. The prom ising future of multiferroic materials lies in the coexistence of tradit ionally uncorrelated properties and the existence of a sizable coupling between them. Multiferroics provide a possibility to control one primary order by means of another primary order and create devices that are sui table for special conditions or can create multifunctionality. However, it is difficult to find multiferroicity due to the incompatiblity of fer romagnetism and ferroelectricity. The mechanism to establish magnetoelec tric coupling is always exotic and varying. Although there have been imp ortant research findings in multiferroics, such as lone-pair based multi ferroics, spin-driven ferroelectricity and multiferroic composites, etc, the field is far from mature yet, and the limitations lie both in the f abrication process as well as the complex measurement methods for charac terizing the magnetoelectrical properties. In this thesis, we achieved a structure consisting of Co atoms and Co na noparticles embedded in a crystalline ZnO thin film, aiming at finding m ultiferroicity and novel magnetotransport in such a nanocomposite system. We fabricated the system by pulsed laser deposition of ZnO followed by high-fluence Co ion implantation. The structural properties were charac terized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements. The majority of Co exists in th e matrix in an oxidized state (i. e. can be treated as a so-called (Zn,Co) O matrix). On the other hand, crystallized nanosize Co particles were f <b>ound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> embedded in the (Zn,Co) O thin films, in which the thin film s till keeps good crystallinity. In such a complex nanocomposite system, t he electrical properties were studied by means of a helium- 4 flow cryost at with a superconducting magnet down to 2. 5 K. The low-temperature resi stance of the films followed the Efros-Shklovskii type variable-range-ho pping. Magnetoresistance revealed a spin-dependent signature that surviv es up to 250 K. Negative magnetoresistance exceeding 10 % was observed at a magnetic field of 1 T. The magnetic properties were characterized by superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. The composite reveals a characteristic superparamagnetic behavior, which is consistent with the presence of metallic Co nanoparticles. In addition, in some ca ses we observed exchange bias in the ZnO-Co system. This exchange bias e ffect constitutes, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first time observat ion of this effect in the ZnO-Co system. Temperature dependent dielectric constant measurements revealed relaxor ferroelectricity, which was further confirmed by polarization measuremen ts. The combination of the polarization measurement with a cryomagnetic system allowed us to determine the magnetoelectric coupling properties. A remarkable magnetoelectric coupling showed up when measuring the polar ization curve under an applied magnetic field. The unexpected relaxor fe rroelectricty is believed to be the result of the local lattice distorti on induced by the incorporation of the Co nanoparticles. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} between tumor cells and the microenvironment {{play a crucial}} role in tumor progression. Tumor cells secrete growth factors, cytokines and proteases and are thus able to affect the gene expression of stromal cells. Activate d stromal cells like fibroblasts, immune cells and endothelial cells are able to promote tumor progression by releasing growth factors, cytokines and proteases. One of the factors which play a central role in this tumor - and stroma - interaction is interleuk in - 6. In many tumor entities, the IL - 6 signal pathway is highly dysregulated by overexpression of IL - 6 and otherwise by permanent activation of the STAT 3 transcription factor. In this work, we showed that IL - 6 stimulation resulted in an increased prolifera tion of HaCaT - ras A 5 benign tumor keratinocytes, but does not affect the fibroblast cell line MSU 1. 1. This increase correlates with the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. We were able to demonstrate that the amount of activated STAT 3 proteins after IL - 6 stimulation in HaCaT - ras A 5 cells is strongly up regulated and the inhibition of STAT 3 activation also inhibits the proliferation of HaCaT - ras A 5 cells. This showed the crucial role of the STAT 3 activation in proliferation of HaCaT - ras A 5 cells. In contrast, fibroblasts showed a stronger inhibition of the JAK/STAT signal pathway by SOCS 3 in comparison with the HaCaT - ras A 5 cells. All data where used to establish a mathematical model of JAK/STAT pathway which is able to describe the dynamic behav ior of STAT 3 and SOCS 3 Proteins. In addition to the effects shown, IL - 6 is also able to affect the proliferation in an indirect manner. To this end, IL - 6 stimulation activates a network of growth factors in HaCaT - ras A 5 cells and fibroblasts like HGF, KGF, VEGF or IL - 8. While IL - 6 showed no direct influence of the proliferation of fibroblasts, the addition of the condition media of both IL - 6 stimulated HaCaT - ras A 5 and as well as IL - 6 stimulated MSU 1. 1 resulted in strong up regulation of the cell numbers o f the other cell line. Comparative gene expression analyses clearly showed that upon IL - 6 stimulation of over 16000 analyzed genes in HaCaT - ras A 5 and Fibroblasts only a subset of 19 genes was up regulated in both cell types. The up regulated genes were f <b>ound</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> closely connected with the interferon signal pathway which gives a potential hint of the cause of the IL - 6 induced inhibition of growth in fibroblasts. Further gene expression analyses showed that the proteinase inhibitor SerpinB 4, was permanent ly up regulated in IL - 6 stimulated HaCaT - ras A 5 cells. The down regulation of Summary 9 SerpinB 4 by siRNA knockdown indicated that SerpinB 4 plays an important role in the proliferation of HaCaT - ras A 5. The observation of this work of the detailed regulation of IL - 6 in tumor and stroma cells should give information about the tumor promoting effect of IL - 6 and will ultimately serve as a basis for therapeutic therapies...|$|E

40|$|Background There is {{increasing}} interest in promoting young people’s health by modifying the school environment. However, existing research offers little guidance {{on how the}} school context enables or constrains students’ health behaviours, or how students’ backgr <b>ounds</b> relate <b>to</b> these processes. For these reasons, this paper reports on a meta-et hnography of qualitative studies examining: through what processes does the school environment (s ocial and physical) influence young people’s health? Methods Systematic review of qualitative studies. Sixteen databases were searched, eliciting 62, 329 references which were screened, with included studies quality ass essed, data extracted and synthesized using an adaptation of Noblit and Hare’s meta-ethnographic approach. Results Nineteen qualitative studies <b>were</b> synthesised <b>to</b> explore processe s through which school- level influences on young people’s health might occur. Four over-arching meta-themes emerged across studies focused {{on a range of}} different health is sues. First, aggressive behaviour and substance use are often a strong source of status and bonding at schools where students feel educationally marginalised or unsafe. Second, health -risk behaviours are concentrated in unsupervised ‘hotspots’ at the school. Third, positive relat ionships with teachers appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> critical in promoting student wellbeing and li miting risk behaviour; however, certain aspects of schools’ organisation and education policies c onstrain this, increasing the likelihood that students look for a sense of identity and social support via health-risk behaviours. Fourth, unhappiness at school can cause students to se ek sources of ‘escape’, either by leaving school at lunchtime or for longer unaut horized spells or through substance use. These meta-themes resonate with Markham and Aveyar d’s theory of human functioning and school organisation, and we draw on these qualitative data to refine and extend this theory, in particular conceptualising more fully the rol e of young people’s agency and student-led ‘systems’ in constituting school environments and generating health ri sks. Conclusion Institutional features which may shape student health behaviours such a s lack of safety, poor student-staff relationships and lack of student voice are amenable t o interventions and should be the subject of future investigation. Future qualitative research should focus on health behaviours which are under-theorised in this context such as physical activity, sexual and mental health...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{investigate}} the effect of palatal plate therapy on the oral motor function children with Down syndrome (DS) during 4 years by comparing the baseline values of the treatment group with those of a control group (CG). The effects of palatal plate therapy on speech production errors and communicative preference after 4 years of treatment were also studied and articulation was analyzed. The habitual orofacial dysfunction of children with DS as a group was described {{in relation to their}} oral structures. In a final study the effects of growth hormone (GH) therapy on craniofiacial development and dental maturity in children with DS who had not been given GH. Twenty-nine children with DS, mean age 10. 7 ± 6 months, were randomized into two groups, the palatal plate group (PPG, n= 14), and the CG (n = 15). and were evaluated using video registration of their oral motor function during 1 year and again oiler 4 years of treatment. Twenty of the children (PPG, n= 9; CG, n= 11) were evaluated longitudinally during 4 years of palatal plate therapy. All children were enrolled in and had followed the same oral motor and sensory stimulation programs. After 1 year the mean duration of the variable "Closed mouth" was significantly longer (P< 0. 001) and the mean duration of the variable "inactive protrusion of the tongue" was significantly shorter (P< 0. 001) in the PPG than in the CG. Summary variables describing active and inactive orofacial muscle function were developed. After 4 years of treatment, the summary variables describing active orofacial muscle function <b>were</b> f <b>ound</b> <b>to</b> constitute 81. 0 ± 11. 0 % of the registered video time in the PPG (n= 9), compared to 68. 2 ± 22. 5 % in the CG (n= 11). Statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the groups in the summary variables describing inactive oral muscle function (P< 0. 01). The measures used to evaluate the groups oiler 4 years of treatment were a clinical extra-and intraoral examination, an articulation assessment, a test of communicative preferences (spoken or manual sign language), and a parental questionnaire. Results from the clinical examination revealed significant differences between the groups in the summary variables for "visible tongue" (P< 0. 01) and the summary variables for "lip rounding score" (P< 0. 01). Facial expression was assessed on a visual analog scale. The PPG scored 75. 6 ± 13. 3 compared to 51. 8 ± 25. 7 in the CG (P< 0. 05). Six children in the PPG and 7 in the CG had enlarged tonsils, defined as an inter-tonsillary reduction of more than 50 %. Results from the parents's questionnaire showed that snoring at night occurred significantly inure often in the CG than in the PPG (P< 0. 05). The study indicates that palatal plate therapy has had effects on the orofacial muscles and the habital position of the tongue as well as on facial expression and mouth closure, particularly during the first year of therapy. One provable effect on articulation was also found. However, considering our experience with these children, we would recommend palatal plate therapy only to hypotonous DS children, who have no major medical disorders, and who have sufficient support from their parents and from speech and language pathologists. Furthermore, in parallel with the treatment routine, controls of the air-way passages should <b>be</b> made <b>to</b> ensure that they are unobstructed. A group of 10 children with DS underwent GH therapy for 3 years, and 3 years after the therapy was terminated craniofacial growth and dental maturity were evaluated.
