5|$|A {{tropical}} storm {{was believed to}} have formed from a low-pressure area, possibly on the tail end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front on October 14. The storm moved westward; however, it began to curve west-southwestward on October 15, as it reached its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm continued to trek towards the west-southwest on October 16, later making landfall in eastern Florida on October 17 as a tropical depression. No damage {{is known to have}} been caused by the {{tropical storm}}.|$|E

5|$|October 1968: The last {{storm to}} impact Arizona {{during the decade}} was Hurricane Pauline, which added high amounts of {{moisture}} ahead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front in early October. The added instability in the atmosphere allowed the cold front to produce severe thunderstorms, including an F2 tornado that wrecked several homes and caused $250,000 (1968 USD) in damage when it touched down in Glendale.|$|E
5|$|Rainbands spawned {{near and}} ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which {{are able to}} produce tornadoes. Rainbands {{associated}} with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front's orientation due {{to the formation of}} a low-level barrier jet. Bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and land breeze boundaries, if enough moisture is present. If sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front, they can mask the location of the cold front itself.|$|E

Multiple politicians of the opposition parties criticized the US-instigated fossil-fuel sanctions in the midst <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> 1992-93 winter, saying that they actually further helped sympathy for Milošević and not against him.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Ten {{formed from}} the complex {{interaction}} between an upper-level low, a tropical wave that produced Tropical Storm Ingrid, and {{the tail end}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front. By September17, the system produced widespread thunderstorm activity over The Bahamas and western Atlantic Ocean. The upper-level low over the Florida Panhandle increased convection across the area, and on September18 the system began crossing Florida. Initially very disorganized, surface pressures gradually decreased across the region, with a weak low-pressure area developing on September19.|$|E
5|$|A {{squall line}} (also {{known as a}} quasi-linear {{convective}} system or QLCS) is a line of thunderstorms forming along or ahead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front. In the early 20th century, the term {{was used as a}} synonym for cold front. It contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts. Strong straight-line winds can occur where the squall line is {{in the shape of a}} bow echo. Tornadoes can occur along waves within a line echo wave pattern (LEWP), where mesoscale low-pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes which develop within the summer season are known as derechos, and they move quite fast through large sections of territory. On the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines, a wake low can be present, sometimes associated with a heat burst.|$|E
5|$|A storm system {{moved to}} the {{northern}} and central Great Plains region during the day, as strong winds helped push a moist air mass northward ahead of the system. Thunderstorms developed during the afternoon ahead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front from southeast South Dakota into central Kansas. Strong winds along with instability in the atmosphere created favorable conditions for supercell development {{with the potential to}} produce strong tornadoes. At approximately 6:35 pm CDT (2335 UTC) a tornado hit the Little Sioux Scout Ranch in Little Sioux, Iowa, killing four Boy Scouts after a chimney collapsed on them and injuring 48others. The camp received a tornado warning 12minutes before it struck. There were 93campers and 25staff members at the camp. The campers were between 13and 18 years old and were attending a leadership training camp. The tornado was rated EF3on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.|$|E

5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky {{is one of the more}} important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|By late on December4, the NHC was {{no longer}} anticipating extratropical transition, after a front passed north of the storm {{and there was no}} interaction. At 0600UTC on December5, the hurricane's {{appearance}} generated 4.7 on the Dvorak technique, a system used to estimate intensity from satellite imagery. This was the highest rating during Epsilon's duration, and suggested winds of 85mph (140km/h), which was its peak intensity. Around that time, the hurricane began a turn to the east-southeast, as the ridge to its north built behind the passage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front. Despite the cold water temperatures and unfavorable strong upper-level winds, Epsilon maintained its intensity, and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) model predicted it would remain a hurricane for nearly three days.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's {{battered}} surface lies on top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> stiff, and icy lithosphere that {{is between}} 80 and 150km thick. A salty ocean 150200km deep may lie beneath the crust, indicated by {{studies of the}} magnetic fields around Jupiter and its moons. It was found that Callisto responds to Jupiter's varying background magnetic field like a perfectly conducting sphere; that is, the field cannot penetrate inside Callisto, suggesting a layer of highly conductive fluid within it with a thickness of at least 10km. The existence of an ocean is more likely if water contains {{a small amount of}} ammonia or other antifreeze, up to 5% by weight. In this case the water+ice layer can be as thick as 250300km. Failing an ocean, the icy lithosphere may be somewhat thicker, up to about 300km.|$|E

2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>cold</b> seep (sometimes called <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> vent) is <b>an</b> area <b>of</b> {{the ocean}} floor where {{hydrogen}} sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage occurs, often in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> brine pool. <b>Cold</b> {{does not mean that}} the temperature of the seepage is lower than that of the surrounding sea water. On the contrary, its temperature is often slightly higher. The [...] "cold" [...] is relative to the very warm (at least [...] ) conditions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hydrothermal vent. <b>Cold</b> seeps constitute <b>a</b> biome supporting several endemic species.|$|R
5|$|Cold {{air from}} the {{remnants}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front became entrained within the circulation; however, the cold air gradually warmed. On October9, winds increased to gale-force and the depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm, at which time it was given the name Bravo. By October10, Bravo had intensified substantially, as hurricane hunters recorded hurricane-force winds roughly 15mi (25km) {{from the center of}} the storm. Following this finding, the National Hurricane Center reclassified the system as a tropical system and renamed it Fran, dropping its previous designation of Bravo. Upon becoming tropical, Fran developed a strong outflow and several convective feeder bands. Additionally, the storm had developed a 35mi (55km) wide eye.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the warm}} waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} phenomena of the surrounding area. Cold north, northwest, or west winds generally blow across the lake following the passage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front, and the temperature difference between the warm lake and the cool air can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere on the Camp, the Army began {{replacing}} the wartime Nissen huts with more permanent structures. New barracks opened in 1955, and the Headquarters of the Army in Scotland arrived {{the same year}} from Edinburgh Castle. Further land was purchased from Lord Rosebery and married quarters were built close to the river. In 1966, a purpose-built office block, by architects Bowhill Gibson and Laing, was constructed within the walled garden, and named Annandale Block in honour of the builder of Craigiehall. Craigiehall Camp was also the site <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cold</b> War Anti-Aircraft Operations Room, built in the 1950s. The two-storey, reinforced concrete structure was listed in 2016 as the best surviving example of its type in Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> blast and hot blast, were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC). The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization. Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process.|$|E
5|$|Fort Snelling was {{established}} in 1819 to extend United States jurisdiction over the area and to allay concerns about British fur traders in the area. The soldiers initially camped at a site {{on the south side}} of the Minnesota River, but conditions were hard there and nearly a fifth of the soldiers died of scurvy in the winter of 1819–1820. They later moved their camp to Camp Coldwater in May 1820. Much of the military's activity was conducted there while the fort was built. Camp Coldwater, the site <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> clear, flowing spring, was also considered sacred by the native Dakota.|$|E
5|$|In addition, a {{tropical}} system {{developed in the}} Gulf of Mexico on May24, based on analysis from Michael Chenoweth and Cary Mock in 2013. Given the name Hurricane Amanda after, a Union ship the storm washed ashore, the tropical cyclone is estimated to have intensified into a hurricane on May27. Amanda moved northward and made landfall {{to the west of}} Apalachicola, Florida, on May28. Early that day, the USS Amanda observed a barometric pressure of , the lowest in association with the cyclone. The storm weakened while moving inland, before accelerating ahead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front and becoming an extratropical cyclone over Kentucky late on May29. An extratropical low absorbed the remnants of the storm over Quebec on May31. According to Chenoweth, Amanda is the only documented United States landfalling hurricane in the month of May since HURDAT records began in 1851.|$|E
