5|$|An era {{came to an}} end in 1668 {{with two}} events: Davenant died suddenly, leaving a messy <b>ownership</b> <b>situation</b> for the Duke's Company, and Pepys' {{eyesight}} forced him to stop keeping a diary. Thomas Betterton, though formally a minority shareholder, continued to run the Duke's Company, and, in the spirit of Davenant, commissioned the most elaborate of the Restoration playhouses, the theatre at Dorset Garden (or Dorset Gardens), with a flat for himself on top. Although the Dorset Garden Theatre quickly became a famous and glamorous venue, very little is concretely known about the building and outfitting of it: a vague and undocumented tradition ascribes its design to Christopher Wren. The absence of Pepys' record means that performance data for the next decades are only patchily known.|$|E

In March, they were one of eight teams threatened with having their participation suspended due to a backlog of debts and fines.

50|$|The idea of {{expansion}} into the United States {{began to take}} shape in the early 1990s, prompted by precarious <b>ownership</b> <b>situations</b> and chronic money shortages amongst the existing Canadian teams. The chief catalyst of the league's struggles was Carling O'Keefe brewery's decision to stop their lucrative television sponsorship in 1987. The arrangement had provided steady income to all of the league's teams, reaching $11 million per season before its withdrawal. The guaranteed revenues, instead of being used to grow the league, had subsidized outdated and shoddy financial practices and marketing both at the team and league level. The Montreal Alouettes, already having been rescued from failure five years prior, folded during the 1987 preseason. It would take two decades for economic equilibrium to again be reestablished.|$|R
25|$|On April 20, Baseball {{commissioner}} Bud Selig {{announced that}} Major League Baseball would appoint a representative {{to take over}} all business and day-to-day operations of the Dodgers.

25|$|Another major feud for WrestleMania X8 was {{the rivalry}} between The Undertaker and the WWF co-owner, Ric Flair. The feud started over The Undertaker's ambush on The Rock during the buildup to No Way Out, with Undertaker giving The Rock a chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver onto a car. Shortly afterwards, Ric Flair openly detested The Undertaker's actions. At the No Way Out event, Flair {{interfered}} with Undertaker's match against The Rock, finally hitting Undertaker with a lead pipe to aid The Rock in victory. Far from pleased over this result, The Undertaker challenged Flair to a match at WrestleMania. Flair refused, stating {{that he is}} an owner and no longer a wrestler. However, Undertaker tried to convince Flair by attacking select members of Flair's friends and family. Following a match on the February 25 episode of Raw, Flair's friend Arn Anderson was ambushed by The Undertaker during his road agent duties. The Undertaker followed this the following week by attacking Flair's son David, threatening that the rest of Flair's children would follow. Upon this attack, Flair accepted the match on the March 7 episode of SmackDown!. Later that night, the two ended up brawling into the audience, resulting in Flair punching out a fan by accident. As a result, Flair was arrested to Undertaker's delight. On the March 11 episode of Raw, Flair's rival co-owner Mr. McMahon asked for an emergency board meeting with the WWF board of directors citing that Flair's attack of a fan was unacceptable and that either he or Flair should have absolute authority and power over the company. With Flair still keen on taking on Undertaker at WrestleMania, CEO Linda McMahon {{had no choice but to}} give Vince total control over the company. Despite this, Linda also stated that the <b>ownership</b> <b>situation</b> would also be reviewed after WrestleMania with a final decision. To add further insult, Mr. McMahon booked David Flair in a match against The Undertaker on the March 14 episode of SmackDown!. The Undertaker almost gave David a Last Ride, but was stopped by Ric Flair who saved his son with some steel chair shots.|$|E
40|$|Common reasons {{mentioned}} for a firm's internationalization {{are related}} to advantages for the firm. However, if firms are conceptualized as political coalitions, this view {{does not seem to}} be sufficient to explain why and to what extent firms internationalize. A principal-agent theoretical approach focusing the ownership-stake-related motivations and bargaining power of owners plus the range of actions managers can employ in different <b>ownership</b> <b>situations</b> offers an alternative explanation. We consequently studied the influences of ownership structure – defined as the concentration of ownership – on a firm's degree of internationalization and the main regions of international diversification. Overall, we conclude that the relationship is non-linear. To test our hypotheses, we utilize panel data for the 102 largest German manufacturing firms from 1990 to 2006.

50|$|In {{the era of}} the Thatcher-Blair {{consensus}} {{the rates}} were abolished, and in the UK there is now no property tax based on <b>ownership,</b> a <b>situation</b> almost unique in the OECD. Further, councils lost the power to set rents.

Members of the band stated that the land belonged to them, noted they would [...] "never relinquish claim to the airport lands", and expected the airport's ownership to be transferred to them after World War I and World War II. They attempted to conceptualize a different agreement, but Transport Canada suggested the band's claims should be ignored, as it is not a proper government. In response, the Penticton Indian Band blocked road entrance to the airport, and terminal. Transport Canada later announced a six-week break from the <b>ownership</b> <b>situation,</b> and a runway-paving project was placed on hiatus. Based on a suggestion from the Penticton City Council, it was later decided that, if the Penticton Regional Airport be closed, the land may be returned to them, although Transport Canada was against this. , the airport is owned and operated by Transport Canada.|$|E

40|$|An {{assignment}} {{situation can}} be considered as a two-sided market consisting of two disjoint sets of objects. A non-negative reward matrix describes the profit if an object of one group is assigned to an object of the other group. Assuming that each object is owned by a different agent, Shapley and Shubik (1972) introduced a class of assignment games arising from these assignment situations. This paper introduces assignment <b>situations</b> with multiple <b>ownership.</b> In these <b>situations</b> each object can be owned by several agents and each agent can participate in the ownership of more than one object. In this paper we study simple assignment games and relaxations that arise from assignment <b>situations</b> with multiple <b>ownership.</b> First, necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for balanced assignment <b>situations</b> with multiple <b>ownership.</b> An assignment <b>situation</b> with multiple <b>ownership</b> is balanced if for any choice of the reward matrix the corresponding simple assignment game is balanced.

2500|$|Following {{the firing}} of three-year head coach Pete Carroll in January 2000, Patriots owner Robert Kraft pursued Jets {{assistant}} head coach Bill Belichick for the Patriots' head coaching vacancy. Belichick, who had been an assistant coach under Parcells with the Patriots in 1996, followed Parcells to the Jets after that season and was contractually named Parcells' successor. [...] A day after the 1999 season, Parcells resigned as {{head coach of the}} Jets and made his second retirement from NFL coaching, and Belichick automatically succeeded him as head coach. The following day, at a press conference for his hiring, Belichick wrote a resignation note on a napkin ("I resign as HC of the NYJ."), and proceeded to give a half-hour resignation speech to the press. Despite rumors that he had been offered the Patriots' vacant head coaching position, Belichick cited the Jets' uncertain <b>ownership</b> <b>situation</b> following the death of owner Leon Hess earlier that year as the reason for his resignation. The Jets denied Belichick permission to speak with other teams, and as had happened in 1997 with Parcells, the NFL upheld Belichick's contractual obligations to the Jets. Belichick then filed an antritrust lawsuit against the NFL in federal court. After Parcells and Kraft, talking {{for the first time since}} Parcells' resignation from the Patriots, agreed to settle their differences, the Patriots and Jets agreed to a compensation package to allow Belichick to become the Patriots' head coach. With the deal, the Patriots sent their 1st-round pick in the 2000 NFL Draft and 4th- and 7th-round picks in the 2001 Draft to the Jets, while also receiving the Jets' 5th-round selection in 2001 and 7th-round pick in 2002.

30|$|Previous {{research}} {{argues that}} export expansion {{is related to}} factors such as firm size, age, affiliation, etc. In this study, we argue from a principal-agent perspective {{that there is a}} relationship between ownership concentration and export intensity in emerging markets. As weak institutions in emerging markets make principals more concerned with control and monitoring agents, ownership concentration arises as a way to protect the interest of principals (Deng, Hofman, & Newman, 2013; Li, Guo, Yi, & Liu, 2010). Therefore, the principal-agent perspective becomes important to analyze the relationship between ownership concentration and export intensity. Since exporting involves stronger asymmetry of information, increasing the possibility of opportunist behavior by the agent, an increasing risk affects the role of principals in a high <b>ownership</b> concentration <b>situation.</b> To that end, agency theory can be used to explain the behavior of managers and investors.|$|R
