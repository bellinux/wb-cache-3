25|$|Further {{research}} implicates the supplementary role of {{proliferating cell}} nuclear antigen (PCNA) to DNA ligase I's function of joining <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments.</b> When the PCNA binding site on DNA ligase I is inactive, DNA ligase I's {{ability to connect}} <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> is severely impaired. Thus, a proposed mechanism follows: after a PCNA-DNA polymerase δ complex synthesizes <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments,</b> the DNA polymerase δ is released. Then, DNA ligase I binds to the PCNA, which is clamped to the nicks of the lagging strand, and catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{pathways}} {{that have}} been proposed to process <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{lagging strand}} synthesis, DNA ligase I connects the <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments,</b> {{following}} {{replacement of the}} RNA primers with DNA nucleotides by DNA polymerase δ. <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> that are not ligated could cause double-strand-breaks, which cleaves the DNA. Since {{only a small number}} of double-strand breaks are tolerated, and only a small number can be repaired, enough ligation failures could be lethal to the cell.|$|E
25|$|PCNA fully encircles the DNA {{template}} strand {{and must be}} loaded onto DNA at the replication fork. At the leading strand, loading of the PCNA is an infrequent process, because DNA replication on the leading strand is continuous until replication is terminated. However, at the lagging strand, DNA polymerase δ needs to be continually loaded {{at the start of}} each <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment.</b> This constant initiation of <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> synthesis requires repeated PCNA loading for efficient DNA replication.|$|R

50|$|In {{eukaryotic}} primer removal, DNA polymerase δ {{extends the}} <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> in 5' to 3' direction, {{and when it}} encounters the RNA primer from the previous <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment,</b> it displaces the 5′ end of the primer into a single-stranded RNA flap, which is removed by nuclease cleavage. Cleavage of the RNA flaps involves either flap structure-specific endonuclease 1 (FEN1) cleavage of short flaps, or coating of long flaps by the single-stranded DNA binding protein replication protein A (RPA) and sequential cleavage by Dna2 nuclease and FEN1.|$|R
25|$|Although {{synthesis}} of the lagging strand involves only half the DNA in the nucleus, the complexity associated with processing <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> is about twice that required to synthesize the leading strand. Even in small species such as yeast, Okazaki fragment maturation happens approximately a million times during a single round of DNA replication. Processing of <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> is therefore very common and crucial for DNA replication and cell proliferation.|$|E
25|$|The Okazakis' {{experiments}} provided extensive {{information on}} the replication process of DNA {{and the existence of}} short, newly synthesized DNA chains that later became known as <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> are short, newly {{synthesized}} DNA fragments {{that are}} formed on the lagging template strand during DNA replication. They are complementary to the lagging template strand, together forming short double-stranded DNA sections. <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> are between 1000 and 2000 nucleotides long in prokaryotes (e.g. Escherichia coli) and are roughly 100 to 200 nucleotides long in eukaryotes. They {{are separated by}} ~120-nucleotide RNA primers and are unligated until RNA primers are removed, followed by enzyme ligase connecting (ligating) an Okazaki fragment onto the (now continuous) newly synthesized complementary strand.|$|E
40|$|The sliding clamp PCNA is {{a crucial}} {{component}} of the DNA replication machinery. Timely PCNA loading and unloading are central for genome integrity and must be strictly coordinated with other DNA processing steps during replication. Here, we show that the S.  cerevisiae Elg 1 replication factor C-like complex (Elg 1 -RLC) unloads PCNA genome-wide following <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> ligation. In the absence of Elg 1, PCNA is retained on chromosomes {{in the wake of}} replication forks, rather than at specific sites. Degradation of the <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> ligase Cdc 9 leads to PCNA accumulation on chromatin, similar to the accumulation caused by lack of Elg 1. We demonstrate that <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> ligation is the critical prerequisite for PCNA unloading, since Chlorella virus DNA ligase can substitute for Cdc 9 in yeast and simultaneously promotes PCNA unloading. Our results suggest that Elg 1 -RLC acts as a general PCNA unloader and is dependent upon DNA ligation during chromosome replication...|$|R
25|$|Each <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> is {{preceded by}} an RNA primer, which is {{displaced}} by the procession of the next <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> during synthesis. RNase H recognizes the DNA:RNA hybrids that are created {{by the use of}} RNA primers and is responsible for removing these from the replicated strand, leaving behind a primer:template junction. DNA polymerase α, recognizes these sites and elongates the breaks left by primer removal. In eukaryotic cells, a small amount of the DNA segment immediately upstream of the RNA primer is also displaced, creating a flap structure. This flap is then cleaved by endonucleases. At the replication fork, the gap in DNA after removal of the flap is sealed by DNA ligase I, which repairs the nicks that are left between the 3'-OH and 5'phosphate of the newly synthesized strand. Owing to the relatively short nature of the eukaryotic <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment,</b> DNA replication synthesis occurring discontinuously on the lagging strand is less efficient and more time consuming than leading-strand synthesis. DNA synthesis is complete once all RNA primers are removed and nicks are repaired.|$|R
40|$|The DNA {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) system {{plays a major}} role in promoting genome stability and suppressing carcinogenesis. In this work, we investigated whether the MMR system is involved in <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation. We found that in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the MMR system and the flap endonuclease Rad 27 act in overlapping pathways that protect the nuclear genome from 1 -bp insertions. In addition, we determined that purified yeast and human MutSα proteins recognize 1 -nucleotide DNA and RNA flaps. In reconstituted human systems, MutSα, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and replication factor C activate MutLα endonuclease to remove the flaps. ATPase and endonuclease mutants of MutLα are defective in the flap removal. These results suggest that the MMR system contributes to the removal of 1 -nucleotide <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> flaps...|$|R
25|$|Following {{creation}} of RNA primers by primase on the lagging strand, DNA polymerase δ synthesizes <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments.</b> DNA polymerase δ also carries out a 3' to 5' exonuclease role, proofreading newly synthesized DNA strands during DNA replication. When the polymerase encounters an erroneous base pair, it removes {{one of the}} nucleotides and replaces it with a correct one. A third function of DNA polymerase δ is to supplement FEN1/RAD27 5' Flap Endonuclease activity. This includes preventing and removing the strand displacement of 5' flaps, and creating ligatable nicks at the border of <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments.</b>|$|E
25|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that an alternative pathway for Okazaki fragment processing exists. This alternative pathway occurs when the Pif1 helicase removes entire <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> initiated by fold back flaps.|$|E
25|$|Primase adds RNA primers {{onto the}} lagging strand, which allows {{synthesis}} of <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> from 5' to 3'. However, primase creates RNA primers {{at a much}} lower rate than that at which DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA on the leading strand. DNA polymerase on the lagging strand also has to be continually recycled to construct <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> following RNA primers. This makes the speed of lagging strand synthesis much lower than that of the leading strand. To solve this, primase acts as a temporary stop signal, briefly halting the progression of the replication fork during DNA replication. This molecular process prevents the leading strand from overtaking the lagging strand.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} {{a degree of}} {{homology}} between eukaryotic replication, transcription and translation proteins and archaeal ones. Hence, Archaea are considered a simplified model for understanding the complex molecular machinery involved in eukaryotic DNA metabolism. DNA replication in eukaryotic cells is widely studied. In recent years, DNA replication studies expanded on the archaeal DNA replication machinery. P. abyssi was the first archaeon whose genome was fully sequenced. Genome sequencing and comparative genomics have highlighted an MCM-like protein in P. abyssi. In this study, I report the biochemical and structural characterisation of PabMCM. PabMCM is explored as model for understanding more complex eukaryotic MCM proteins and unravelling the biochemical mechanism by which MCM proteins release their helicase activity. The crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus possesses a simplified toolset for DNA replication compared to Eukaryotes. In particular, S. solfataricus has {{a subset of the}} eukaryotic <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation factors, among which there are a heterotrimeric DNA sliding clamp, (the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PCNA), the DNA polymerase B 1 (PolB 1), the flap endonuclease (Fen 1) and the ATP-dependent DNA ligase I (LigI). PCNA functions as a scaffold with each subunit having a specific binding affinity for each of the factors involved in <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation. Here, the 3 D reconstruction of PCNA in complex with the <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation proteins PolB 1, LigI and Fen 1 is reported...|$|R
40|$|Strand {{displacement}} by a DNA polymerase {{serves a}} key role in <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation, which involves displacement of the RNA primer of the preexisting <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> into a flap structure, and subsequent flap removal and fragment ligation. We investigated the role of Sulfolobus chromatin proteins Sso 7 d and Cren 7 in strand displacement by DNA polymerase B 1 (PolB 1) from the hyper-thermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus. PolB 1 showed a robust strand displacement activity and was capable of synthesizing thousands of nucleotides on a DNA-primed 72 -nt single-stranded circular DNA template. This activity was inhibited by both Sso 7 d and Cren 7, which limited the flap length to 3 – 4 nt at saturating concentra-tions. However, neither protein inhibited RNA dis-placement on an RNA-primed single-stranded DNA minicircle by PolB 1. Strand displacement remained sensitive to modulation by the chromatin proteins when PolB 1 was in association with proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Inhibition of DNA instead of RNA strand displacement by the chromatin proteins is consistent with the finding that double-stranded DNA was more efficiently bound and stabilized than an RNA:DNA duplex by these proteins. Our results suggest that Sulfolobus chro-matin proteins modulate strand displacement by PolB 1, permitting efficient removal of the RNA primer while inhibiting excessive displacement of the newly synthesized DNA strand during <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation...|$|R

25|$|DNA {{replication}} on the {{lagging strand}} is discontinuous. In lagging strand synthesis, {{the movement of}} DNA polymerase {{in the opposite direction}} of the replication fork requires the use of multiple RNA primers. DNA polymerase will synthesize short fragments of DNA called <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> which are added to the 3' end of the primer. These fragments can be anywhere between 100-400 nucleotides long in eukaryotes.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, linear chromosomes face {{another issue}} that is not seen in circular DNA replication. Due {{to the fact that}} an RNA primer is required for initiation of DNA synthesis, the lagging strand is at a disadvantage in replicating the entire chromosome. While the leading strand can use a single RNA primer to extend the 5' terminus of the replicating DNA strand, multiple RNA primers are responsible for lagging strand synthesis, creating <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments.</b> This leads to an issue {{due to the fact that}} DNA polymerase is only able to add to the 3' end of the DNA strand. The 3'-5' action of DNA polymerase along the parent strand leaves a short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) region at the 3' end of the parent strand when the <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> have been repaired. Since replication occurs in opposite directions at opposite ends of parent chromosomes, each strand is a lagging strand at one end. Over time this would result in progressive shortening of both daughter chromosomes. This is known as the end replication problem.|$|E
25|$|However, Pol α is {{not able}} to {{continue}} DNA replication and must be replaced with another polymerase to continue DNA synthesis. Polymerase switching requires clamp loaders and it has been proven that normal DNA replication requires the coordinated actions of all three DNA polymerases: Pol α for priming synthesis, Pol ε for leading-strand replication, and the Pol δ, which is constantly loaded, for generating <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> during lagging-strand synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Priming enzymes, (which are DNA-dependent RNA polymerases), {{solve this}} problem by {{creating}} an RNA primer on the leading and lagging strands. The leading strand is primed once, and the lagging strand is primed approximately every 1000 (+/- 200) base pairs (one primer for each <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> on the lagging strand). Each RNA primer is approximately 10 bases long.|$|R
40|$|This review {{discusses}} recent insights in {{the roles}} of DNA polymerases (Pol) δ and ε in eukaryotic DNA replication. A {{growing body of evidence}} specifies Pol ε as the leading strand DNA polymerase and Pol δ as the lagging strand polymerase during undisturbed DNA replication. New evidence supporting this model comes from the use of polymerase mutants that show an asymmetric mutator phenotype for certain mispairs, allowing an unambiguous strand assignment for these enzymes. On the lagging strand, Pol δ corrects errors made by Pol α during <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> initiation. During <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation, the extent of strand displacement synthesis by Pol δ determines whether maturation proceeds by the short or long flap processing pathway. In the more common short flap pathway, Pol δ coordinates with the flap endonuclease FEN 1 to degrade initiator RNA, whereas in the long flap pathway, RNA removal is initiated by the Dna 2 nuclease/helicase...|$|R
25|$|In the {{presence}} of a single stranded DNA-binding protein RPA, the DNA 5' flaps become too long, and the nicks no longer fit as substrate for FEN1. This prevents the FEN1 from removing the 5′-flaps. Thus, Dna2's role is to reduce the 3′ end of these fragments, making it possible for FEN1 to cut the flaps, and the <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> maturation more efficient.|$|R
25|$|The {{discontinuous}} {{stretches of}} DNA replication {{products on the}} lagging strand are known as <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> and are about 100 to 200 bases in length at eukaryotic replication forks. The lagging strand usually contains longer stretches of single-stranded DNA that is coated with single-stranded binding proteins, which help stabilize the single-stranded templates by preventing a secondary structure formation. In eukaryotes, these single-stranded binding proteins are a heterotrimeric complex known as replication protein A (RPA).|$|E
25|$|DNA {{replication}} {{separates the}} early and late phases. Once the early genes have liberated adequate virus proteins, replication machinery, and replication substrates, replication of the adenovirus genome can occur. A terminal protein that is covalently bound to the 5’ end of the adenovirus genome acts as a primer for replication. The viral DNA polymerase then uses a strand displacement mechanism, {{as opposed to the}} conventional <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> used in mammalian DNA replication, to replicate the genome.|$|E

40|$|Initiation of DNA {{replication}} involves three sequential steps. First, one or {{more specific}} trans-acting proteins bind to specific cis-acting DNA se-quences referred to as origins of replication (DePamphilis 1993 a,b; Kornberg and Baker 1992). Second, DNA unwinding of the two comple-mentary templates begins. This step is usually carried out by a DNA heli-case but can also be done by some DNA polymerases (e. g., adenovirus [Ad]). DNA unwinding is facilitated by single-strand-specific DNA-binding proteins such as replication protein A (RP-A), which coat the templates, and by topoisomerase I, which releases torsional stress gener-ated by unwinding DNA. Third, DNA synthesis is initiated on one or both templates. In cellular chromosomes and DNA viruses that do not encode their own DNA polymerase (e. g., SV 40, PyV, and PV), DNA polymerase-a:DNA primase complex synthesizes a short RNA-primed nascent DNA chain referred to as an <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment.</b> The first <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragment</b> initiated on each template is extended continuously b...|$|R
25|$|DNA is {{synthesised}} from 5' to 3', so when copying the 3' to 5' strand, replication is continuous. Phosphodiester links form {{between the}} 3' to 5' and nucleotides {{can be added}} {{with the aid of}} the enzyme DNA polymerase for the continuous leading strand. However, in order to synthesise the lagging strand (the 5' to 3' strand) synthesis must occur in small sections (100-200 nucleotides at a time in eukaryotes). These new stretches of DNA are called <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments</b> and each one requires its own RNA primer.|$|E
25|$|Flap {{endonuclease}} 1 (FEN1) {{is responsible}} for processing <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments.</b> It works with DNA polymerase to remove the RNA primer of an Okazaki fragment and can remove the 5' ribonucleotide and 5' flaps when DNA polymerase displaces the strands during lagging strand synthesis. The removal of these flaps involves a process called nick translation and creates a nick for ligation. Thus, FEN1's function is necessary to Okazaki fragment maturation in forming a long continuous DNA strand. Likewise, during DNA base repair, the damaged nucleotide is displaced into a flap and subsequently removed by FEN1.|$|E
25|$|The {{first is}} {{the best known of}} these {{mechanisms}} and is used by the cellular organisms. In this mechanism, once the two strands are separated, primase adds RNA primers to the template strands. The leading strand receives one RNA primer while the lagging strand receives several. The leading strand is continuously extended from the primer by a DNA polymerase with high processivity, while the lagging strand is extended discontinuously from each primer forming <b>Okazaki</b> <b>fragments.</b> RNase removes the primer RNA fragments, and a low processivity DNA polymerase distinct from the replicative polymerase enters to fill the gaps. When this is complete, a single nick on the leading strand and several nicks on the lagging strand can be found. Ligase works to fill these nicks in, thus completing the newly replicated DNA molecule.|$|E
