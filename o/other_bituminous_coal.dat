40|$|Rejecting the {{formidable}} {{stereotype of the}} “company town,” and narrow perspective of capital-labor relations, this study investigates the “model” bituminous coal mining company town of Slickville, Pennsylvania and its immigrant mining families 2 ̆ 7 socio-cultural adaptation to American culture {{in the first half}} of the 20 th century. The contexts of Slickville 2 ̆ 7 s paternalistic structure and the cultural goals of immigrant working families coalesced, to establish for both the coal company and the town 2 ̆ 7 s inhabitants, the desired ideal of stability. ^ Created by Cambria Steel in 1916, amidst a volatile era of industrial relations, Slickville 2 ̆ 7 s cooperative form of welfare capitalism, as seen through the town 2 ̆ 7 s design, landscape, company housing and offered amenities, stabilized its labor force and contributed significantly to immigrant families 2 ̆ 7 adaptation processes. Southern and East-Central European mining families carried pre-migration standards of “a good life” to the modern industrial system which were then shaped by acquired understandings of deplorable conditions in <b>other</b> <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> towns. Qualitatively choosing Slickville as a town in which to live and work, families used all resources available to them, accumulating “family capital,” and purchased land, built homes, opened businesses and began several ethnic organizations within a few years of the Slickville 2 ̆ 7 s creation. ^ Immigrant mining families wanted residential stability to consume materially and Cambria Steel wanted a stable workforce to ensure its productive capability. In the process, a community was formed. First and second-generation oral histories describe the boom of the 1920 s, how families and kin weathered through the Great Depression, and how Slickville continued after mining operations formally ended in 1943. ...|$|E
40|$|A new use for Illinois coal is as fuel {{injected}} into a blast furnace to produce molten iron as {{first step in}} steel production. Because of cost and decreasing availability, metallurgical coke is being replaced by coal injected at the tuyere area of the furnace where the blast air enters. Purpose {{of this study is}} to evaluate combustion of Illinois coal in the blast furnace injection process in a pilot plant test facility. (Limited research to date suggests that coals of low fluidity and moderate to high S and Cl contents are suitable for blast furnace injection.) This proposal is intended to complete the study under way with Armco and Inland and to demonstrate quantitatively the suitability of Herrin No. 6 and Springfield No. 5 coals for injection. Main feature of current work is testing of Illinois coals at CANMET`s pilot plant coal combustion facility. During this quarter, two additional 300 -pound samples of coal (IBCSP- 110 Springfield No. 5 and an Appalachian coal) were delivered. Six Illinois Basin coals were analyzed with the CANMET model and compared with <b>other</b> <b>bituminous</b> <b>coals</b> from the Appalachians, France, Poland, South Africa, and Colombia.

40|$|Methane {{emissions}} {{resulting from}} the release of methane trapped in coal beds can {{have a significant impact}} on the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with coal production. These emissions vary dramatically by coal rank, specific seam, and seam depth and thickness. This is particularly true of underground mines, where 50 of the nation’s 600 active underground mines are responsible for 98 % of all methane emissions. Various methods can be utilized to mitigate methane emissions, although at present these technologies have only seen limited deployment domestically due to lack of clear incentives or other barriers such as unclear ownership of rights to the gas, proximity of methane to market or a lack of desire to invest in new processes. Despite these factors, coal mine methane (CMM) recovery and use continues to grow, with over 46 billion cubic feet (Bcf) recovered domestically in 2006 – a 10 % increase from 2003. [1] The U. S. Department of Environmental Protection (EPA) reports that of the 50 mines identified as potential candidates for CMM recovery (CMMR), 14 mines have implemented recovery strategies. [1] It is expected that deployment will increase dramatically for gassy mines in the event that carbon regulation is passed, due to the potential cost associated with emissions: methane emissions would incur a cost 25 times higher than carbon emissions based on their increased global warming potential (GWP). This paper explores methane content and emissions associated with mining Illinois Basin coals such as Illinois No. 6. Illinois Basin <b>bituminous</b> <b>coals</b> tend to have a higher gas content than <b>other</b> <b>bituminous</b> <b>coals,</b> but the range of values is quite large, with methane contents as low as 10 standard cubic feet per ton of coal (scf CH 4 /ton) and as high as 250 scf CH 4 /ton being reported. As the methane content of the coal does not account for methane which has desorbed into the surrounding rock strata, specific methane emissions resulting from mining this coal will be even higher, with a 50 % increase in emissions expected...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports on}} the first complex data set of {{emission}} factors (EFs) of selected pollutants from combustion of five fuel types (lignite, <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal,</b> spruce, beech, and maize) in six different domestic heating appliances of various combustion designs. The effect of fuel {{as well as the}} effect of boiler type was studied. In total, 46 combustion runs were performed, during which numerous EFs were measured, including the EFs of particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), hexachlorobenzene (HxCBz), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/F), etc. The highest EFs of nonchlorinated pollutants were measured for old-type boilers with over-fire and under-fire designs and with manual stoking and natural draft. Emissions of the above-mentioned pollutants from modern-type boilers (automatic, downdraft) were 10 times lower or more. The decisive factor for emission rate of nonchlorinated pollutants was the type of appliance; the type of fuel plays only a minor role. Emissions of chlorinated pollutants were proportional mainly to the chlorine content in fuel, but the type of appliance also influenced the rate of emissions significantly. Surprisingly, higher EFs of PCDD/F from combustion of chlorinated <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> were observed for modern-type boilers (downdraft, automatic) than for old-type ones. On the <b>other</b> hand, when <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> was burned, higher emissions of HxCBz were found for old-type boilers than for modern-type ones. Web of Science 45219434942...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of humic acids (HAs) from <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> was verified by laboratory oxidation. In {{a relatively short}} time the oxidation by air at temperature above 150 °C led to the {{formation of}} HAs. These HAs were compared with those isolated from oxidized <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> from the vicinity of red bed bodies, from weathered <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal,</b> oxihumolite and lignite. For this the organic and inorganic elemental composition of HAs, apparent dissociation constants, metal-binding capacities, nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectra were determined and evaluated. With increasing temperature of laboratory oxidation of <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> the percentage of aromaticity of HAs increases. HAs prepared from coal oxidized at 150 °C are characterized by an aromaticity index 78 % while for HAs prepared at 250 and 300 °C by 95 % aromaticity. The same index for HAs isolated from naturally oxidized <b>bituminous</b> <b>coals</b> is of about 87 % whereas it is of about 50 % for oxihumolite and lignite. The apparent dissociation constants (Kapp) are much higher in HAs isolated from oxihumolite and lignite (pKapp from 3. 35 to 3. 80) than those from oxidized <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> samples (pKapp from 4. 47 to 4. 85). There is a good negative correlation between Pb-binding capacity and pKapp of all samples suggesting that metallic ions are bonded to acidic groups of HAs.

The C 1 <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> widely used in the high-incidence area of lung cancer in Xuanwei was selected as experiment group, while the C 2 + 1, K 7, and M 30 <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> that was mined and used in the low-incidence area of lung cancer in Xuanwei for more than 10 years were selected as control group. Fourteen paraffin-embedded cancer tissue samples from the non-smoking women with {{non-small cell lung cancer}} who were born in Xuanwei and were at least the 3 rd generation of the family living there were collected from the department of pathology, the third affiliated hospital of kunming medical university (tumor hospital of yunnan province). Titrimetric potassium silicofluoride method was used to measure {{the content of}} silica in raw coal and its bottom ashes in 20 samples from the experimental group and control group. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the morphology of silica particles in C 1 <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> and its bottom ashes, and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM-EDX) was used to analyze the microscopic composition. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to observe the morphology of silica particles in the bottom ashes and coal soot of C 1 <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> as well as the lung cancer tissue from the non-smoking women in Xuanwei, and transmission electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (TEM-EDX) was used to analyze the microscopic composition. The silica particles were separated from the coal soot and bottom ashes and characterized by physical method. The silica content in C 1 <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> and its bottom ashes was significantly higher than that in C 2 + 1, K 7, and M 30 <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> (P < 0. 05). The bottom ashes of C 1 <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> contained a large quantity of silica particles, mostly with microscale sizes. Silica particles were found in the soot of C 1 <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> and the lung cancer tissue from non-smoking women in Xuanwei. The silica particles in the bottom ashes were mostly 120 ∼ 500 nm in diameter, had various shapes, and contained such elements as iron, aluminium, calcium, and potassium; the silica particles in the coal soot were mostly nanoscale, ranging from 37 nm to 80 nm in diameter, had various shapes, with some in fibrous form, had non smooth surfaces, and contained such elements as iron, potassium, calcium, aluminium, and sulfur. In Xuanwei, the incidence of lung cancer among non-smoking women is high in the area where silica-rich C 1 <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> is produced. There are silica particles enriched in both the combustion products (coal soot and bottom ashes) of C 1 <b>bituminous</b> <b>coal</b> and the cancer tissue from the non-smoking women with non-small cell lung cancer, with similar morphology and microscopic composition.
