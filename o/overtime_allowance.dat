5000|$|Work {{hours in}} Japan are decreasing, but many Japanese still work long hours. Recently, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) issued a draft report recommending major {{changes to the}} {{regulations}} that govern working hours. The centerpiece of the proposal is an exemption from overtime pay for white-collar workers.Japan has enacted an 8-hour work day and 40-hour work week (44 hours in specified workplaces). The overtime limits are: 15 hours a week, 27 hours over two weeks, 43 hours over four weeks, 45 hours a month, 81 hours over two months and 120 hours over three months; however, some workers get around these restrictions by working several hours a day without 'clocking in' whether physically or metaphorically. [...] The <b>overtime</b> <b>allowance</b> should not be lower than 125% and not more than 150% of the normal hourly rate.|$|E

It is to note that if the {{employee}} works {{no more than five}} days a week, the employee’s normal working day is 9-hour and the working week is 44 hours. Also, if the number of hours worked of the worker is less than 44 hours every alternate week, the 44-hour weekly limit may be exceeded in the other week. Yet, this is subjected to the pre-specification in the service contract and the maximum should not exceed 48 hours per week or 88 hours in any consecutive two week time. In addition, a shift worker can work up to 12 hours a day, provided that the average working hours per week do not exceed 44 over a consecutive 3-week time.

40|$|Background: Availability {{of human}} {{resource}} {{for health and}} its distribution to required areas is vital in delivering health care services, especially in rural areas. Deployment, attraction and retention of health workers in rural districts/areas have {{been a problem for}} a long period. Various incentives and benefits have been set by the government of Tanzania whereby employers are directed to provide those incentives to improve attraction and retention of health workers. However, its implementation and outcomes is not well explored. Objectives: The study aimed at assessing the implementation of the public health sector incentive scheme for attraction, deployment and retention of human resource for health in Newala district. Materials and methods: A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted in Newala district between March and May, 2010 using both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. A total of 120 health workers were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires, and an interview guide was used for key informants (4 district officials and three heads of facilities) in their respective workplaces. Results: Majority of health workers interviewed were not aware of their stipulated benefits and rights. Health workers who had heard about the govermnent documents stipulating health workers rights and benefits were 63. 3 %, while only 14. 5 % of those who had heard about the documents reported to had ever read such government documents. Both financial and non financial incentives were implemented but the <b>overtime</b> <b>allowances</b> were less implemented in rural health facilities as compared to urban health facilities. It was also found that majority of health workers had attended seminars (81. 7 %), while less than fifty percent had been promoted (33. 3 %), and went for leave (24. 2 %). Nurses {{were more likely to have}} had attended seminars than other cadres. Furthermore, district/health facility official reported that some of the incentives were specific to a certain cadres while some were for all health workers (e. g. <b>overtime</b> <b>allowances).</b> Majority of health workers who reported to had received non financial incentives were satisfied with those incentives which also was reported to create job satisfaction, however, those who reported to had received financial incentives were not satisfied with leave allowances hence created job dissatisfaction. Incentives preferred by health workers were <b>overtime</b> <b>allowances,</b> 	 	 Vlll improved working conditions and tools, while their leaders preferred to provide hardship allowances and housing. This study also revealed the factors affecting effective implementation of incentive scheme were shortage of funds and district lack authoritative power to implement. Conclusion and Recommendations: Majority of health workers interviewed were not aware of their benefits and rights. Both fmancial and non fmancial incentives were implemented but <b>overtime</b> <b>allowances</b> were less implemented in rural facilities. Health workers who reported to receive non fmancial incentives were satisfied with those incentives which also were reported to create job satisfaction. District and facilities leaders should give education to all health workers concerning their benefits and rights. Implementation of non fmancial incentives (e. g. recognition) should be emphasized. Further research should be conducted to assess the relationship between different types of incentives and improved work performance in hard to reach districts...|$|R

This variability along with patient preferences driving scheduling decisions resulted in both low operating room (OR) utilization and significant overtime for surgical teams at Mayo Clinic. In this paper we discuss {{the development of an}} improved scheduling approach for spine surgeries over a rolling planning horizon. First, data mining and statistical analysis was performed using a large data set to iden-tify categories of surgeries that could be grouped together based on surgical time distributions and could be categorized at the time of case scheduling. These surgical categories are then used in a hierarchical optimiza-tion approach with the objective of maximizing a weighted combination of OR utilization and net profit. The optimization model is explored to consider trade-offs and relationships among utilization levels, financial per-formance, <b>overtime</b> <b>allowance,</b> and case mix. The new scheduling approach was implemented via a custom web-based application that allowed the surgeons and schedulers to interactively identify best surgical days with patients.

The study therefore is to study and come out with the effect and ways of motivating worker in organization, hence comparative study of Manufacturing firms in Nnewi, Chicason group Nig Ltd, Ibeto group of company Nig Ltd, Capital Oil and Gas Nig Ltd, Cultix Cable Nig Ltd, and Innoson Motors Nig Ltd. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in the analysis of the data. Necessary literatures were reviewed. During the analysis of the data it was discovered that the goal of motivation is to cause people to put fourth their best efforts with enthusiasm and effectiveness in order to achieve and hopefully surpass organizational objective. It is evidence that workers of manufacturing firms in Nnewi are poorly motivated; hence low productivity. Findings from the research on productivity of manufacturing firm’s staff are reported. Two sets of questionnaires were employed in the study. One set was administered on management staff and the other on junior staff. The study reveals that salaries paid to junior staff in the company were very below the stipulations of Nigerian National Joint Industry Council. It further shows that the junior staff is rarely promoted and the junior staff prefers financial incentives than non financial incentives.

The study had three objectives, namely; to examine the role played by local government authorities (LGAs) informing, promoting and sustaining secondary school teachers’ motivation in Dodoma municipality; to identify problems facing LGAs in promoting secondary school teachers’ motivation in Dodoma municipality; and to explore possible initiatives that LGAs can undertake to enhance motivation to secondary school teachers in Dodoma municipality. The theoretical framework adopted for the study was a modified concept of Herzberg’s theory. Data collection was done using questionnaires and interviews. Sixty teachers from six public secondary schools filled in the questionnaire. Interviews were administered to six heads of schools, one district secondary education officer, two zonal school inspectors and one district TTU official. The findings show that LGAs were making efforts to motivate teachers, though at low range. The motivation of teachers was found not to be sustainable as LGAs had no proper plans to provide teachers with the required motivation. On the other hand the LGAs were faced with several challenges in motivating teachers, these including poor parental support to schools and their development projects whereby parents refused to contribute money or their manpower in projects such as building of teachers’ houses or classrooms; poor implementation of targeted education plans and shortage of fund in the education sector which hindered the implementation of education plans by LGAs. LGAs also failed to improve teaching conditions in different schools. The study recommended that LGAs should establish mechanisms to ensure that teachers’ living conditions are improved; teachers’ <b>overtime</b> <b>allowances</b> are paid; teachers are promoted on time and incentives like leave travel assistance, salary, arrears and other claims are paid to the teachers...|$|R

40|$|The Memorandum of Understanding {{negotiated}} with the EU/IMF in 2010 committed the government to reform the Joint Labour Committee (JLC) system covering low pay workers. A significant rationale for the proposed reform was the claim that JLC regulations unduly added {{to the cost of}} labour regarding overtime rates and particularly premiums for Sunday working.  Using the 2007 National Employment Survey this paper examines the structure of earnings of workers likely to be covered by the JLC system {{and the extent to which}} low pay workers benefit from <b>overtime</b> earnings, shift <b>allowances</b> and bonuses in the private sector. The evidence does not support the argument that over-time payments including Sunday premiums in sectors covered by JLCs represent a major cost to employers in general. Few workers actually benefit from the JLC overtime rates. We argue that the removal of a floor on conditions of employment provided by the JLCs may not always be in the interests of the employer but may create a race to the bottom in low pay sectors of the economy.   PUBLISHEDpeer-reviewe...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to steel and other useful materials, however, ships (particularly older vessels) can contain many substances that are banned or considered dangerous in developed countries. Asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are typical examples. Asbestos was used heavily in ship construction {{until it was}} finally banned {{in most of the}} developed world in the mid 1980s. Currently, the costs associated with removing asbestos, along with the potentially expensive insurance and health risks, have meant that ship-breaking in most developed countries is no longer economically viable. Removing the metal for scrap can potentially cost more than the scrap value of the metal itself. In most of the developing world, however, shipyards can operate without the risk of personal injury lawsuits or workers' health claims, meaning many of these shipyards may operate with high health risks. Furthermore, workers are paid very low rates with no <b>overtime</b> or other <b>allowances.</b> Protective equipment is sometimes absent or inadequate. Dangerous vapors and fumes from burning materials can be inhaled, and dusty asbestos-laden areas around such breakdown locations are commonplace.|$|R

40|$|This study {{explains}} {{the structure of}} the temporary or irregular form of employment in South Korea. In Korea, the size of the irregular workers as a percentage of labor force increased from 43. 4 % to 52. 7 % from 1996 to 2005. Both the sheer absolute size and the rapid rate of growth are evidence for the dominance of this form of employment in Korea. However, irregular workers are generally kept deprived of health insurance, unemployment insurance, <b>overtime</b> payments, retirement <b>allowances,</b> and any kind of bonuses. Largely, irregular Korean workers are subject to job insecurity and meager pay rates. While there is the institution of a social security system in place for the irregular workers in Korea, due to the lenient law enforcement of social security obligations, firms find it cost effective to evade giving these benefits and hence employ more and more from the irregular segment of the labor force. Almost 70 % of all irregular workers are females who are employed as part-timers, on-call workers, and day laborers, through temporary agencies, subcontracting companies, and independent contractors. Over time, the powerful dominant enterprises have successfully managed to maintain low wage payments to irregular female workers relative to male workers. Persistence of the wage differentials between male and female irregular workers highlights the cost advantage of hiring female workers and the temporal exit of more male workers from the irregular labor force. There are institutions of labor unions for workers in Korea which are significantly represented by the male workers. The female union membership went down from 36. 7 % in 1980 to 21. 1 % in 2003 whereas that of the male union members increased from 63. 3 % to 78. 9 % in the same period. The lenient laws and cursory light enforcement of regulations by the government and gender discrimination in the trade unions have {{led to the development of}} non-governmental organizations (NGOs) of women worker activists undertaking the lead role in support of irregular worker movements such as the Korean Women Workers’ Association United (KWWAU). However, in South Korea, there are large, conglomerate family-controlled firms with strong ties to the government known as the “chaebol”. The chaebol have an important role in controlling the irregular labor force. The supportive policies regarding the employment of the irregular workers are for the most parts weaved around the interests and benefits of the chaebols. [URL]...|$|R
