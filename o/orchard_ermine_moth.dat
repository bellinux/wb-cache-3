40|$|The apple <b>ermine</b> <b>moth,</b> Yponomeuta malinellus Zeller, is a {{univoltine}} pest {{species that}} defoliates apple, Malus domestics (Borkh) (Rosaceae), in the temperate {{region of the}} Palaearctic. First instars overwinter within a communal hibernaculum beneath the covering of the egg batch (Kock 1998). In spring, larvae emerge to initially mine apple leaves and subsequently feed externally within a communal tent (Menken et al. 1992). During heavy infestations, the communal tents may envelop the entire apple tree, resulting in total defoliation (Parker and Schmidt 1985). There have been several accidental introductions and subsequent eradications of the apple <b>ermine</b> <b>moth</b> in eastern North America (Hewitt 1917; Parker and Schmidt 1985) but, by 1989, the pest {{was found in the}} Fraser River Valley in British Columbia, in Whatcom county, Washington, and in northwestern Oregon (Antonelli 1991; Unruh et al. 1993...|$|R

5000|$|The {{wingspan}} of Yponomeuta plumbella {{ranges from}} 16 to 20 millimeters. In the imago the fore wings are white punctuated with three rows of very small black spots (hence {{the family name}} of <b>ermine</b> <b>moths)</b> while the hindwings are greyish. These moths are clearly distinguishable from other related moths, because of the distinguished black mark {{in the middle of}} the inner rim of the forward wing and the black marking at the tip of the forward wing. [...] The legs and the long antennae are white.|$|R
