40|$|AbstractAccording to {{the present}} standards, the <b>optical</b> <b>characterization</b> of line-focusing {{concentrators}} follows the quasi-dynamic test method, thus resulting from thermally based experimental measurements. The impact of optical deviations from design conditions on a concentrator optical performance increases with concentration ratio.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{advanced}} <b>optical</b> <b>characterizations</b> of microfabricated solid immersion lenses with 2 -µm diameter, operating at λ = 642 nm. The main feature, the spot size reduction, has been investigated by applying a focused Gaussian beam of NA = 0. 9.

Detailed <b>optical</b> <b>characterizations</b> have been conducted by measuring the amplitude and phase distributions with a high-resolution interference microscope (HRIM) in volume around the focal spot. The immersion effect of the SiO 2 solid immersion lens leads to a spot-size reduction of approximately 1. 5 which agrees well with theory.

40|$|The <b>optical</b> <b>characterization</b> of {{materials}} in thin film phase {{is a standard}} task {{in the field of}} coating technology. One typical problem is the <b>optical</b> <b>characterization</b> of a single layer of material deposited on a well-known substrate. Provided the physical model considered for the modeling is correct and the available experimental data (usually spectrophotometric or ellipsometric spectra) are accurate, a precise <b>optical</b> <b>characterization</b> is quite straightforward. However, there are experimental circumstances where several samples have been coated under very well defined conditions, as when they have been obtained in the same coating run, so that no differences are expected due to the positions of each individual sample inside the chamber during the deposition process. The aim of this work is to present an improved procedure for the <b>optical</b> <b>characterization</b> of the material deposited under the very well controlled conditions explained above. The basi s of our method is to use the "a priori" information about the identical nature of all the samples, introducing all the spectrophotometric and/or ellipsometric data available from measurements into a global optimization procedure. This leads to a unique determination of the parameters that define the optical properties of the layers, as compared with the separate (individual) characterization of the samples. We will illustrate our procedures for MgF 2 films in the range 200 - 800 nm...|$|E
