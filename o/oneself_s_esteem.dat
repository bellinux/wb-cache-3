A person generally has only imperfect knowledge of his own ability (or long term payoff) in pursuing a task, and will undertake it only if he has sufficient self con dence.

This generates an incentive for such principals to distort their signals so as to manipulate the agent's self confidence. We first study situations where an informed principal chooses an incentive structure, such as offering payments or rewards, delegating a task, or simply giving encouragement. We show that rewards may be weak reinforcers in the short term and that, as stressed by psychologists, they may have hidden costs in that they become negative reinforcer [...] ...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} obesity {{epidemic}} in America, and it is affecting children as much as adults. In response, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Health mandated that in the 2005 - 2006 school year all school health officials were required to conduct a Body Mass Index (BMI) screening on all children attending public school. The BMI was used to identify students who were obese and thus at risk for serious health issues. ^ The Pennsylvania Department of Public Health created a mandate that requires school nurses to calculate the body mass index for all school aged children beginning in the 2005 - 2006 school year. After the Body Mass Index is calculated for a student the school nurse is required to send home a notice to parents informing them that their child is above, below or at normal body weight. Many parents and educators are concerned that this information can affect a child 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> self <b>esteem</b> and distort their body image, {{which can lead to}} eating disorders. This research study was conducted to determine whether this mandate and the process itself affect a child 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> self <b>esteem.</b> ^ This study took advantage of the natural experiment offered by the new state mandate, examining the consequences of identifying clinically obese children at the elementary school level. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the impact of the PA Department of Public Health 2 ̆ 7 s mandate that required every elementary school nurse to calculate the Body Mass Index for every student attending public school in the state of Pennsylvania and to determine if there was any consequences on the students 2 ̆ 7 body image and self esteem. ^ The subjects, the students in an urban school district, were randomly assigned to a treatment group, where the BMI was mailed home and a control group. The study gathered quantitative information from the participants using the Piers-Harris 2 : The Way I Feel About Myself student survey. The results were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences and a regression analysis was conducted. The results of the regression analysis demonstrated that the treatment, who received the BMI had no significant impact on the experimental group 2 ̆ 7 s body image or self esteem. ^ The study also gathered qualitative information from the parents of the students who were identified as being obese or overweight. The results of these surveys indicated that parents did not believe that their child 2 ̆ 7 s body image and self-esteem had been negatively impacted by the Body Mass Index Screening process. The results of the parent survey also indicated that process for notifying parents needed to be carefully monitored and that educational programs for parents and children needed to be developed to help parents understand the value of engaging their children in living a healthy lifestyle. ...|$|R
2500|$|Mumming and guising {{was a part}} of Samhain from {{at least}} the 16th century and was {{recorded}} in parts of Ireland, Scotland, Mann and Wales. It involved people going from house to house in costume (or in disguise), usually reciting songs or verses in exchange for food. It is suggested that it evolved from a tradition whereby people impersonated the aos sí, or the souls of the dead, and received offerings on their behalf. Impersonating these spirits or souls was also believed to protect <b>oneself</b> from them. <b>S.</b> V.

40|$|In the mid- 1970 s, it was {{an article}} offaith that {{contract}} was not properly conceived as {{a means by which}} persons could, by their own choice, make law for themselves to govern their relations. Instead, contract was thought best conceived as the rectification of injuries persons may have caused by their verbal conduct {{in much the same way}} that persons have a duty to rectify the injuries caused by their physical acts. With contracts, these injuries consisted of detrimental reliance on the words of another. So conceived, both contract and tort duties are imposed by law, and do not arise from the parties 2 ̆ 7 consent. Thus contract law is conceptually indistinguishable from tort law. The doctrinal implications of this reliance-based conception of contract were twofold. First, since duties were imposed by law rather than being the product of the parties 2 ̆ 7 consent, we need not concern ourselves with many of the niceties of finding mutual assent in the formation stage. Second, if reliance was the basis of contract, then the normal expectation measure of recovery was also suspect [...] justified, if at all, as an indirect way to protect what Fuller and Perdue labeled the 2 ̆ 2 reliance interest. 2 ̆ 2 Indeed, it says much about the conventional wisdom during the 1960 s and 1970 s that Fuller and Perdue 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> justly <b>esteemed</b> 1936 article, 2 ̆ 2 The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages, 2 ̆ 2 received far greater attention than Fuller 2 ̆ 7 s later 2 ̆ 2 Consideration and Form. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|Can you {{remember}} the first time you were exposed to the arts? Might it have been in elementary school? Many schools in today 2 ̆ 7 s society face budget cuts to art programs since they are overlooked for their educational benefit. However, one might not even realize that these art programs, such as dance classes, can have positive effects on a student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> self <b>esteem</b> and social interactions with others. An alternate way for students to become exposed to the arts is through educational outreach programs. Dance educational outreach programs have been established by schools, community centers, and dance companies as a means of distributing dance to students across America. These outreach programs provide dance education to students who are not usually exposed to any forms of dance. Dance not only provides students with a great source of exercise, but also with a means of expression. Students that participate in dance classes gain confidence in themselves, which is also known as intrapersonal intelligence. Interactions with other students in a dance class, such as the teamwork needed to perform a dance, require interpersonal intelligence. Howard Gardner established a theory of nine multiple intelligences including the interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence. These two intelligences are a vital part of a child 2 ̆ 7 s life that is supplemented by dance classes. In order to prove the value of dance educational outreach programs and the importance they have on a child 2 ̆ 7 s development, this theory is put to the test. Elementary ages students are tested in their intrapersonal and interpersonal intelligences before and after participating in an extended period of dance educational outreach classes.

Additionally, it created an image of how older same-sex attracted adults view themselves and the needs that they perceive within their population. Same-sex attracted adults, age 50 and older, were recruited through an anonymous online survey (N = 327; Age M: 59 years old, SD = 6. 96). Sexual identity development was assessed with the GIQ (Brady 2 ̆ 6 Busse, 1994; Halpin 2 ̆ 6 Allen, 2004), and psychological well-being was assessed via the Depression-Happiness Scale (Joseph 2 ̆ 6 Lewis, 1993), Satisfaction with Life Scale (Pavot 2 ̆ 6 Diener, 1993), UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell, 1996), Rosenberg 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Self <b>Esteem</b> Scale (Rosenberg, 1989), Interpersonal Support Evaluation List.

We hypothesize that perfectionist attitude and risky sexual behaviors will each {{have a significant effect on}} a person 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> sexual <b>esteem.</b> This research is important because we recognize that a lot of people seek therapy due to low levels of sexual esteem and by researching what variables may affect it, we can find more effective ways of providing therapy to improve sexual esteem. Having a perfectionist attitude that is above average may lead to insecurities about how one feels as a sexual partner. If an individual has a low sexual esteem and is high in perfectionism, it could lead to serious relationship problems, which may result in seeing a therapist. The data I find will be able to contribute to the current information in this field and aid in future studies that include perfectionism and/or sexual esteem variables. Past research has shown that perfectionism does affect interpersonal relationships (Habke 2 ̆ 6 Flynn, 2002; Shea, Slaney, 2 ̆ 6 Rice, 2006). In 2013, it was estimated that 110 million Americans are consciously living with a sexual transmitted infections.

40|$|Abstract The main aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{importance}} of guidance and counselling in Malawian Secondary Schools. Given the nature of education and the psycho-social dilemmas in which the students find themselves is guidance and counselling optional or a must? Two public secondary schools in Central West Division were identified for the study. Questions that guided the study were: How prominent is guidance and counselling in Malawian secondary schools? How equipped are teachers for the role of guiding and counselling students and how do they perceive it? What has the Ministry of Education done so far about guidance and counselling students and what it intends to do? A qualitative research design was used to collect data. People were interviewed orally using some questions to guide the interview. An interview schedule was prepared with a list or set of questions or issues which were to be explored during the interviews. The following people were interviewed (1) two Ministry of Education officials, (2) one official from the Guidance, Counselling and Youth Development Centre for Africa, (3) one counsellor from each of the two schools, (4) two students from each school- one representing the junior section and another the senior section, (5) two head-teachers, each representing the schools studied, (6) two teachers, one from each school and (7) two school-dropouts, a boy and a girl. In addition, observation method was also used. The researcher observed some group counselling sessions in one of the schools to appreciate and gain some insights into how counselling is done. Further, secondary materials such as books, magazines, periodicals, news papers, published and unpublished Ministry of Education documents and reports were read. Thus, the information collected from both the primary and secondary sources was analyzed. The results showed that learners had unique needs and concerns that called for the provision of guidance and counselling in schools. It was also found out that while teachers acknowledged the urgency for the provision of guidance and counselling in secondary schools, being a counsellor was perceived as an additional role to teaching. This attitude was due to lack of exposure to guidance and counselling courses in the initial-teacher training and the failure of the top-down mode of in-service trainings. In addition, a good number of teachers are burnt-out, stressed and frustrated. Yet, this is a crucial human resource for the implementation and provision of guidance and counselling in schools. On the other hand, it was found out that when guidance and counselling were provided retention of students in school was improved (reduced dropout rate), academic achievement improved, misbehaviour was minimised, interrelationships improved, pupil <b>s</b> self <b>esteem</b> and self-worth improved, learners got a focus and direction on their future careers, learners made informed choices. On the other hand lack guidance and counselling led to school dropout, educational wastage, underachievement, poor self image and low self esteem, poor interrelationships, lack of focus and direction on future careers, poor choices. Hence, guidance and counselling cannot be left to chance. Another finding was that the aspect of power disparity was evident among pupils, between pupils and counsellors, between teachers and the administration and amongst the teachers themselves...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the psychosocial correlates of attachment in adolescents living in a rural area during pregnancy and early motherhood. Early exchanges between the mother and her infant provide a positive foundation on which to build relationships across the lifespan. The aims of this research is twofold. Firstly, problems in attachment have been proposed to have an important causative role in childhood delay and problems in emotional, social and intellectual development. Secondly, postnatal depression in mothers is known to be associated with problems of attachment and social support. One hundred and twenty two consenting pregnant adolescents attending a public based midwifery antenatal clinic in a rural health service area in south west New South Wales participated in a correlational study. One hundred and thirteen adolescent mothers were reinterviewed at 6 weeks and 6 - 12 months after the birth of the baby. A demographic questionnaire and six objective research instruments were employed to measure the main variables of attachment, self esteem, social support and postnatal depression. i) The Maternal-Foetal Attachment Scale, ii) Prenatal Attachment Inventory, iii) The Support Behaviours Inventory, iv) Rosenberg 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Self <b>Esteem</b> Scale. During motherhood: v) How I Feel About My Baby Now Scale, vi) Maternal Attachment Inventory vii) Parenting Sense of Competence Scale, viii) Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and ix) Facilitators and Regulators Questionnaire. Qualitative data was collected exploring the mother 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with her foetus and her infant. The results indicated that maternal-foetal attachment was significantly related to the amount and quality of social support. Higher maternal-infant attachment scores were associated with self esteem at 6 - 12 months after the birth of the baby and to greater social support. High maternal-infant attachment was associated with positive parenting sense of competence and high self esteem at 6 weeks and 6 - 12 months during motherhood. Lower maternal-infant attachment was associated with those adolescents suggestive of the symptoms of postnatal depression at 6 weeks and 6 - 12 months after the birth of the baby. Self esteem decreased as the symptoms suggestive of postnatal depression increased at 6 weeks and 6 - 12 months. This study found that self esteem, social support and postnatal depression were the main variables impacting on attachment In adolescents during pregnancy and early motherhood. The quality of support and number of people perceived supportive by the adolescent influences greater attachment behaviours in pregnancy. High self -esteem influenced greater attachment behaviours at 6 - 12 months after the birth of the baby but not at 6 weeks after delivery. Positive parenting sense of competence was associated with high maternal-infant attachment and higher self esteem at 6 weeks and 6 - 12 months during motherhood. Symptoms suggestive of postnatal depression were associated with lower attachment scores and lower self esteem. Maternal-foetal attachment in pregnant adolescents was not associated with maternal-infant attachment in adolescent mothers at 6 weeks or 6 - 12 months. This study alerts us to the issues faced by pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers living in a rural area in relation to attachment. Of concern is the high rate of symptoms suggestive of postnatal depression which may influence attachment. It is essential that midwives and health professionals provide a family centred approach, actively involving not only the pregnant adolescent and adolescent mother but also the family where possible. This in turn may reduce the risk of postnatal depression and its potential impact on maternal-infant attachment. A significant finding not directly associated with the hypotheses of this study relate to the high rate of older partners, conflict relationships and domestic violence. This issue is a cause for concern and midwives need to be vigilant for indicators of domestic violence...|$|R
