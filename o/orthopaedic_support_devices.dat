40|$|One of {{the areas}} of medical textile is the spacer knitted {{orthopaedic}} products. The concept of compression therapy of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>supports</b> lies on a simple and efficient mechanical principle – it consists of applying elastic garment around the limb. Spacer <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>supports</b> are knitted on flat knitting machines equipped with especial elastomeric thread feeder. Compression made by the support depends on the support area, shape and characteristics of knitting. Because of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>supports</b> are intended for durable wearing and need to vouchsafe compression of fixed value, {{it is very important}} to known how processes acting during exploitation influence alteration of compression values. The aim of this study was to establish the alteration of compression of knitted support during exploitation, i. e. after multifold extension, washing and drying. The samples were knitted on a flat double needle bed knitting machine in combined jacquard-laid-in pattern with elastomeric weft threads. It was established that compressive properties of knits after cyclic tensile load changed slightly, i. e. range between margins of error. It was measured that knitted <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>supports</b> dimensions and density after washing and drying cycles changes significant, i. e. knitted supports shrinks and thickens and their compression decreases.

The results of the three studies reveal that the amount of <b>support</b> <b>device</b> usage is limited and that even advice {{on the use of the}} <b>support</b> <b>device</b> cannot always enhance this use. Studies 1 and 2 revealed that the type of <b>support</b> <b>devices</b> influenced the amount of usage.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis study {{investigated}} the effects on global cardiac function and myocardial energetics of limiting progressive dilatation after infarction {{by means of a}} woven polyester jacket cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device.</b> We hypothesized that placement of the cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> results in a decrease in myocardial wall stress and improvement in cardiac function and myocardial energetics. MethodsTo investigate the effect of passive constraint on left ventricular function and mechanics, a total of 10 sheep were studied with pressure-volume analysis and magnetic resonance imaging. A baseline study was followed by the creation of an anterior infarct. After 1 week, the animals underwent a second study. The cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> was then placed over the epicardium in 5 sheep; the remaining animals served as controls. A terminal study was performed at 2 months after the infarct. ResultsThe cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> group at the terminal study exhibited a decrease in end-diastolic volume (control 110. 3 ± 19. 8 mL vs cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> 67. 6 ± 4. 7 mL, P =. 006) and an improved ejection fraction (control 15. 5 % ± 5. 7 % vs cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> 29. 46 % ± 4. 42 %, P =. 008) relative to the control group. Myocardial energetics were also enhanced in the cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> group, as evidenced by the significant improvements in potential energy (control 2015 ± 503 mL · mm Hg/beat vs cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> 885 ± 220 mL · mm Hg/beat, P =. 006), efficiency (control 39. 4 % ± 13. 6 % vs cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> 59. 8 % ± 8. 5 %, P =. 044), and oxygen consumption (control 0. 072 ± 0. 013 mL O 2 /beat vs cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> 0. 052 ± 0. 007 mL O 2 /beat, P =. 034). ConclusionPassive constraint with the cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> after infarct prevents further remodeling and may stimulate reverse remodeling in heart failure secondary to acute myocardial infarction. These results suggest that in human beings placement of the cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> after a large anterior myocardial infarction may be effective in halting the remodeling process that often leads to end-stage heart failure. If proved effective, placement of a cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> after large heart attacks has the potential to decrease the incidence of heart failure that results after large myocardial infarctions...|$|R

40|$|Heart {{failure is}} a growing health problem, {{affecting}} {{an increasing number of}} patients with rapidly increasing costs for the health care system. In spite of recent improvements in pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical treatments the prognosis for patients with severe heart failure is still poor. Heart failure is associated with numerous processes and changes in left ventricular structure and function often referred to as left ventricular remodelling. The Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> is a mesh-like polyester device designed to arrest and reverse these processes thereby facilitating left ventricular reversed remodelling in heart failure. We have explored the effect of passive containment surgery using the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> in heart failure patients with ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Following application of the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> reduced cardiac dimensions, increased functional capacity, decreased levels of circulating plasma levels of Endothelin- I and improved quality of life was demonstrated. Furthermore, the possible beneficial effect on reduction on left ventricular dilatation with application of the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> concomitant with aortic valve replacement in patients with longstanding aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dilatation was evaluated. No additive beneficial effects of application of the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> were found in these patients when compared to patients with chronic aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dilatation undergoing aortic valve replacement as the sole procedure. The acute effects of application of the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> in experimental porcine myocardial infarction were investigated. No acute effect on hemodynamics, coronary vasomotor function, Endothelin- I levels or infarction size was demonstrated following application of the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> at induction of acute experimental myocardial infarction. Based on the findings in these studies it is concluded that application of the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> is safe, simple and without apparent negative effects. In heart failure patients with ventricular dilatation the Acorn Cor Cap Cardiac <b>Support</b> <b>Device</b> represents a novel and interesting amendment to current surgical treatment options with likely beneficial effects...|$|R

40|$|Thioureas, often {{contained}} within neoprene to provide water resistance, {{are an important}} cause of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in those who use neoprene products. We wish to present three cases of thiourea-induced ACD from three different <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>supports</b> containing neoprene. The first case was a 67 -year-old woman who developed an itchy rash on her heel three weeks after using a neoprene insole for plantar fasciitis. The second case was a 47 -year-old man who developed an itchy rash on his wrist after wearing neoprene wrist splints for psoriatic arthropathy. The third case was a 77 -year-old woman who experienced a severe erythematous rash with blistering from a neoprene elbow brace she received following a humeral fracture. All patients were patch tested to the British Society of Cutaneous Allergy Standard and rubber series and a cut piece from all the relevant supports. At 96 hours, all patients had a + reaction to mixed dialkylthiourea, diethylthiourea, and the supports’ material. No other positive patch test reactions were identified. As neoprene is fast {{becoming one of the}} most popular materials used for <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>supports,</b> awareness of this reaction and close liaison between dermatologists and orthopaedic surgeons are therefore essential to allow for early recognition of this complication...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundThe cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> <b>supports</b> {{the heart}} and {{mechanically}} reduces left ventricular (LV) diastolic wall stress. Although {{it has been shown}} to halt LV remodeling in dilated cardiomyopathy, its therapeutic efficacy is limited by its lack of biological effects. In contrast, the slow-release synthetic prostacyclin agonist ONO- 1301 enhances reversal of LV remodeling through biological mechanisms such as angiogenesis and attenuation of fibrosis. We therefore hypothesized that ONO- 1301 plus a cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> might be beneficial for the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy. MethodsTwenty-four dogs with induced anterior wall infarction were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 groups at 1  week postinfarction as follows: cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> alone, cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> plus ONO- 1301 (hybrid therapy), ONO- 1301 alone, or sham control. ResultsAt 8 weeks post-infarction, LV wall stress was reduced significantly in the hybrid therapy group compared with the other groups. Myocardial blood flow, measured by positron emission tomography, and vascular density were significantly higher in the hybrid therapy group compared with the cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> alone and sham groups. The hybrid therapy group also showed the least interstitial fibrosis, the greatest recovery of LV systolic and diastolic functions, assessed by multidetector computed tomography and cardiac catheterization, and the lowest plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels (P < . 05). ConclusionsThe combination of a cardiac <b>support</b> <b>device</b> and the prostacyclin agonist ONO- 1301 elicited a greater reversal of LV remodeling than either treatment alone, suggesting the potential of this hybrid therapy for the clinical treatment of ischemia-induced heart failure...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Social {{support is}} an {{important}} factor in the rehabilitation process, as it has a positive influence on patients' health, functioning and recovery. In particular, perceived social support and instrumental support are important after total hip or knee arthroplasty. However, nursing staff often appear to estimate the amount of support available to patients by number of visitors. Until now, no suitable Dutch-language scale was available to measure social <b>support</b> in <b>orthopaedic</b> patients. AIM: The aim of this paper is to describe the development and initial validity and reliability testing of the Groningen <b>Orthopaedic</b> Social <b>Support</b> Scale, a self-report questionnaire to measure social support in patients after total hip or knee arthroplasty. METHODS: A total of 119 people who had had arthroplasty completed the Groningen <b>Orthopaedic</b> Social <b>Support</b> Scale and a control scale. The reliability and validity of the questionnaire were analysed. RESULTS: Reliability of the Groningen <b>Orthopaedic</b> Social <b>Support</b> Scale can be considered satisfactory, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0. 89. Analysis of construct validity by means of factor analysis yielded two factors: perceived social support and instrumental support. A Pearson's correlation between these subscales was moderate (r = 0. 61 and statistically significant). Concurrent validity can be considered satisfactory, with a Pearson correlation of 0. 72 (P < 0. 001) between the Groningen <b>Orthopaedic</b> Social <b>Support</b> Scale and the control list. CONCLUSIONS: The Groningen <b>Orthopaedic</b> Social <b>Support</b> Scale can be considered suitable for measuring social support. It can be used to help nursing staff determine if a patient's need for social support is fulfilled, and to advise family and friends on the basis of the results. The questionnaire can also be used to establish the role of social support as a factor in supportive interventions during and after hospital sta...|$|R
