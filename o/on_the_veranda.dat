The Master and the Place's {{superintendent}} try to quell the behavior, with no success. During a walk with the girl, Lad protects her from her father. The next day, while the Master and Mistress are at a show and the other workers are off on holiday, Sonya's father starts to beat her for accidentally dropping a heavy basket. Lad comes to her rescue and they retreat to the veranda where she pets him while he sleeps. When Sonya goes to the barn, her father is waiting for her and closes the door. Somehow she senses Lad beside her, which gives her the courage {{to stand up to}} her father. The man imagines he sees Lad beside her and runs away in fear. Unknown to both, Lad had died in his sleep and the Master and Mistress were crying over his body <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>veranda.</b>|$|E

Many of the settings were warm relational studies, such as Night Rain at the Double-Shelf Stand {{which includes a}} parlor scene with two young women and a boy. A soft mood is set {{with the presence of}} a tea set and portable hearth for boiling water. The Metropolitan Museum of Art states that this painting is a nod to Night Rains of 8 Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers, a painting well respected by both the Japanese and Chinese.|$|E

25|$|In {{their first}} {{morning at the}} brothel, {{photographs}} of Ruff-O'Herne {{and the others were}} taken and placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>veranda</b> which was used as a reception area for the Japanese personnel who would choose from these photographs. Over the following four months the girls were raped and beaten day and night, with those who became pregnant forced to have abortions. After four harrowing months, the girls were moved to a camp at Bogor, in West Java, where they were reunited with their families. This camp was exclusively for women who had been put into military brothels, and the Japanese warned the inmates that if anyone told what had happened to them, they and their family members would be killed. Several months later the O'Hernes were transferred to a camp at Batavia, which was liberated on August 15, 1945.|$|E

500|$|Warner Brothers {{initially}} hired Aram Avakian, a [...] "talented, aggressive young ex-film editor" [...] {{known for}} his avant-garde tendencies, to direct the film. The studio wanted a sentimental dog story that played true to the novel, which Avakian opposed. In a 1969 Life interview, Avakian stated that he [...] "wanted to make a kind of pop, camp thing that wouldn't be a complete ordeal for parents" [...] while everyone else involved in the production wanted [...] "Dick, Jane and Doggie". Jack Warner, then head of the studio, eventually fired him, bringing the more conventional Leslie H. Martinson to complete the film. Peter Breck and Peggy McCay were cast as Lad's owners, renamed to Stephen and Elizabeth Tremayne. Veteran actor Carroll O'Connor was hired to play the pompous and newly wealthy Hamilcar Q. Glure, {{with the role of}} his daughter played by Angela Cartwright, a noted young actress who had starred in The Danny Thomas Show. To cast the role of Lad, a talent search was conducted, eventually resulting in the selection of a collie from the San Fernando Valley who was credited simply as [...] "Lad". The film is set in {{a modified version of the}} Place, with Pompton Lake reduced to a river with a large dock. The house, though similar to the real Terhune home, even including duplicates of the stone lions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>veranda,</b> was built on a scale three times larger than the original.|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday, September 6, 1901, McKinley dressed {{formally}} as usual, then departed the Milburn House for a stroll through the neighborhood. [...] The President nearly slipped away unguarded; when the police and soldiers noticed him leaving, they hurried after him. Czolgosz also rose early {{with the intent of}} lining up for the public reception at the Temple of Music; he reached the Exposition gates at 8:30a.m., {{in time to see the}} President pass in his carriage en route to the train station for the visit to Niagara Falls. [...] The McKinleys traveled by train to Lewiston, where they switched to trolleys to view the Niagara Gorge. [...] When the party reached the municipality of Niagara Falls, they transferred to carriages to see the sights. [...] The party rode halfway across the Honeymoon Bridge overlooking the Falls, though McKinley was careful not to enter Canada for reasons of protocol. [...] It was a hot day, and Ida McKinley felt ill due to the heat; she was driven to the International Hotel to await her husband, who toured Goat Island before joining his wife for lunch. [...] After smoking a cigar <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>veranda,</b> the President rode with his wife to the train which now awaited them nearby, and saw her settled there before touring the hydroelectric plant at the Falls. [...] The train then returned to Buffalo so McKinley could attend the reception at the Temple of Music. [...] Ida McKinley had originally intended to accompany her husband to the auditorium, but as she was not fully recovered, she decided to return to the Milburn House to rest. [...] As the time allotted for the reception had been pared down to ten minutes, the President did not expect to be separated from his wife for long. [...] As it was only 3:30p.m., McKinley stopped for refreshments at the Mission Building before proceeding to the Temple of Music.|$|E

2500|$|When {{it became}} clear that the crowd was not going to disperse, a group of 77 National Guard troops from A Company and Troop G, with bayonets fixed on their M1 Garand rifles, began to advance upon the {{hundreds}} of unarmed protesters. As the guardsmen advanced, the protesters retreated up and over Blanket Hill, heading out of the Commons area. Once over the hill, the students, in a loose group, moved northeast along the front of Taylor Hall, with some continuing toward a parking lot in front of Prentice Hall (slightly northeast of and perpendicular to Taylor Hall). The guardsmen pursued the protesters over the hill, but rather than veering left as the protesters had, they continued straight, heading toward an athletic practice field enclosed by a chain link fence. Here they remained for about 10 minutes, unsure of how to get out of the area short of retracing their path. During this time, the bulk of the students congregated to the left and front of the guardsmen, approximately [...] away, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>veranda</b> of Taylor Hall. Others were scattered between Taylor Hall and the Prentice Hall parking lot, while still others were standing in the parking lot, or dispersing through the lot as they had been previously ordered.|$|E
