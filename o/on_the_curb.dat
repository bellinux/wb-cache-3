25|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of spectators line the parade route along Market Street. Some arrive hours in advance to claim a prime spot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> with {{a clear view of}} the street. Others climb onto bus shelters, the walls of subway station stairs, or scaffolding on buildings to get a clear view. As the parade ends, the spectators are able to pass through the barriers and march down Market street behind the parade. The end of the parade route is near the Festival location at the Civic Center.|$|E
25|$|On 22 March 2001, {{tensions}} soared {{further in}} Tetovo, when two Albanian men, {{a father and}} a son, were shot dead during a routine search at a police checkpoint. The incident began when the car was stopped and a police officer saw the younger Albanian move something in his pocket. Fearing it was a grenade the officer panicked and ran. The Albanian exited the car, dropped to his knees, and threw the grenade {{in the direction of the}} running policeman. It landed at his feet but failed to explode. At the moment the grenade was thrown, a cordon of Macedonian troops, positioned behind sandbags, unleashed a volley of gunfire at the Albanian. At first he slumped against the car, then fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb,</b> dead. Moments later the father was also shot as he tried to run from the car. Witnesses later interviewed insisted the father and son died with mobile phones in their hands, claiming that the pair were victims of revenge by police.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} the boys find a girl crying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> and realize she is the former Miss Foley made young again but also totally blind. They assist her to her house, but when they return they're cut off by a parade. The {{carnival}} is out searching the streets {{for the two of}} them. The boys hide, and Will's father spots them hiding under a storm drain in front of the cigar store. The boys convince him to keep quiet. Mr. Dark later arrives to talk to him. Mr. Holloway pretends not to know the two boys whose faces are tattooed on the man's hand, but when the Witch comes and begins to sense the boys' presence he blows cigar smoke at her- choking her and forcing her to leave. Mr. Dark then asks Charles Holloway for his name, and Will's father tells him he is the town library's janitor. That night Will and Jim meet him at the library where he has done research into his own father's ministerial notes. The carnival arrives once a generation, and leaves {{in the midst of a}} giant storm. Mr. Dark appears and the boys hide in the book stacks. He discovers both of them and crushes the janitor's hand when Mr. Holloway attempts to fight him. The tarot witch casts spells on the boys to mesmerize them and also tries to stop Mr. Holloway's heart. Just before he is about to die, Charles Holloway looks at the Witch and begins to laugh hysterically. His laughter wounds her deeply and drives her away. He then follows Mr. Dark to the carnival to rescue the boys.|$|E

40|$|Curb {{detection}} is {{an essential}} component of Autonomous Land Vehicles (ALV), especially important for safe driving in urban environments. In this paper, we propose a fusion-based curb detection method through exploiting 3 D-Lidar and camera data. More specifically, we first fuse the sparse 3 D-Lidar points and high-resolution camera images together to recover a dense depth image of the captured scene. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> recovered dense depth image, we propose a filter-based method to estimate the normal direction within the image. Then, by using the multi-scale normal patterns based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb’s</b> geometric property, curb point features fitting the patterns are detected in the normal image row by row. After that, we construct a Markov Chain to model <b>the</b> consistency of <b>curb</b> points which utilizes the continuous property of <b>the</b> <b>curb,</b> and thus <b>the</b> optimal <b>curb</b> path which links <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> points together can be efficiently estimated by dynamic programming. Finally, we perform post-processing operations to filter the outliers, parameterize <b>the</b> <b>curbs</b> and give <b>the</b> confidence scores <b>on</b> <b>the</b> detected <b>curbs.</b> Extensive evaluations clearly show that our proposed method can detect curbs with strong robustness at real-time speed for both static and dynamic scenes...|$|R

He did, however, criticize Gaga's [...] "half-convincing" [...] lip-synching. Writing for The Washington Post, Sarah Anne Hughes called the video [...] "shockingly simple". Amos Barshad from New York liked the straight approach Gaga took with the video, and although he called it boring compared to Gaga's previous efforts, he felt the video worked well because of the simplicity.|$|E

500|$|Musicians Kid Rock and Joe C. guest {{starred in}} the episode as themselves, {{performing}} at the annual spring break concert that Homer sneaks out to attend. When Joe C. makes his first appearance on stage in the episode, Homer mistakes him for a child that has lost his parents. After performing his song [...] "Bawitdaba", Kid Rock tells the audience {{that he is going}} to pour out forty gallons of malt liquor <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> as a way of showing respect to his homies that could not make it to the concert. When Homer hears this he starts to drink the malt liquor. Just as Kid Rock and Joe C. are about to stop him by hurling Joe C. (now wearing a spiked helmet) at him with a slingshot, the sheriff arrives and settles the situation. Scully said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press that the staff of the show chose Kid Rock and Joe C. for the episode because the two [...] "have a lot of stage presence" [...] and visually are [...] "a funny combination," [...] and because the staff thought [...] "they would be funny playing off Homer." [...] According to Scully, the two musicians [...] "had a great sense of humor [...] about themselves," [...] with Kid Rock asking if [...] "he could add a couple of his own lines. He wanted to introduce himself as 'the pimp of the nation.' We kept that in the show. It's quite a title." [...] Kid Rock recorded some of his dialog over the phone, but also paid a 45-minute visit to the Simpsons studio in Los Angeles to record lines. Scully thought it looked like the singer enjoyed the experience and was surprised to see that he arrived on time. [...] "My first reaction to that was, 'What kind of rock star is this?'," [...] Scully jokingly told the Detroit Free Press. All of Joe C.'s lines were recorded over the phone.|$|E

2500|$|Tommy and Richard {{are denied}} {{entry to the}} Zalinsky {{boardroom}} since Tommy {{does not have any}} standing (his shares having been repossessed due to the apparent failure). After briefly wallowing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> in self-pity, Michelle arrives with Paul and Beverly's police records. Tommy devises 'a plan': dressed as a suicide bomber by using road flares, he gains the attention of a live television news crew and then, with Michelle and Richard, forces his way into the boardroom. Back in Sandusky, Callahan workers watch the drama on a television. In a final move of pure persuasion, Tommy quotes Zalinsky's own advertising slogan, that he {{is on the side of}} the [...] "American working man." [...] As the TV audience watches, Zalinsky signs Tommy's purchase order for 500,000 brake pads. Although Zalinsky says that the purchase order is meaningless since he will soon own Callahan Auto, Michelle reveals the police records, which include Paul's outstanding warrants for fraud. Since Paul is the true husband of Beverly, her marriage to Big Tom was bigamous and therefore illegitimate. Therefore, Beverly's inheritance is voided and Tommy is the next of kin, and thus the rightful heir of Big Tom. Since Tommy refuses to sell the shares, the deal with Zalinsky is off, and since Tommy still holds Zalinsky's purchase order, the company is saved. Paul attempts to escape but is arrested. Zalinsky admits that Tommy outplayed him and honors the large sales order. Later, Tommy assumes the presidency of Callahan Auto Parts, giving a speech to the employees that the door is always open to them. The film ends with Tommy drifting in his dinghy on a lake, telling his father's spirit he will continue his legacy at Callahan and says he must go ashore to have dinner with Michelle's family.|$|E
