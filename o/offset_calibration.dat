The measurements of S parameters (basically insertion loss and return loss of the ports) were conducted in two steps. First, we measured the impedance match of the 3 -step circular-to-square waveguide transition using a circular waveguide-to coax adapter with a SMA probe in the place of the Multiple Injector Noise Source Assembly (MINSA) assembly shown in Fig.  2. A return loss of about − 40  dB was found within 200  MHz of the proposed center frequency of 5  GHz. This return loss was accounted for as an additional <b>calibration</b> <b>offset</b> during the measurement of the overall return loss of the OMT. Second, using the above measurement as a <b>calibration</b> <b>offset,</b> we obtained a return loss below − 30  dB for the entire OMT. The measurements for port 1 at 4.9, 5.0, and 5.1  GHz are plotted in Fig.  5 together with simulated profiles for the two possible polarization modes (labelled as S 11 and S 22). Similar return losses were obtained at the SMA probes of the rectangular waveguide-to-coax adapters labelled 10 in Fig.  2. During the tests, all open ports were filled with microwave absorbers. The experimental points became indistinguishable from the simulation curves for these two polarization modes once the tuning back-short was properly adjusted through several iterative steps.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the current state}} of the ground segment of Herschel-SPIRE photometer data processing, approximately one year into the mission. The SPIRE photometer operates in two modes: scan mapping and chopped point source photometry.

However, the calibration parameters and detailed numerical algorithms have advanced due to the availability of commissioning and early science observations, resulting in reliable pipelines which produce accurate and sensitive photometry and maps at 250, 350, and 500 µm with minimal residual artifacts. We discuss some detailed aspects of the pipelines on the topics of: detection of cosmic ray glitches, linearization of detector response, correction for focal plane temperature drift, subtraction of detector baselines (<b>offsets),</b> absolute <b>calibration,</b> and basic map making.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an industrial robot joint <b>offset</b> <b>calibration</b> method called the virtual line-based single-point constraint approach. Previous {{methods such as}} using CMM, laser trackers or cameras are limited by the cost or the resolution. The proposed method relies mainly upon a laser pointer attached on the end-effector and single position-sensitive detector (PSD) arbitrarily located on the workcell. The automated calibration procedure (about three minutes) involves aiming the laser lines loaded by the robot towards {{the center of the}} PSD surface from various robot positions and orientations. The intersections of each pair of laser lines eventually should converge to the same point after compensating the joint offsets. An optimization model and algorithm have been formulated to identify the robot offset. For the highly precise feedback, a segmented PSD with a position resolution of better than 0. 1 μm is employed. The mean accuracy of robot localization is up to 0. 02 mm, and the mean error of the parameter identification is less than 0. 08 degrees. Both simulations and experiments implemented on an ABB industrial robot verify the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed calibration system.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} whether a remote, miniaturized pressure sensor could maintain calibration and function through organized thrombus {{over an extended}} period in a porcine model of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). METHODS: Six adult pigs had an AAA surgically created and excluded. A sensor zeroed to atmospheric pressure was placed within the aneurysm sac and another within the suprarenal aorta of each animal. Pressure measurements were taken at the initial operation and then on a weekly basis over 2 months. The aortic sensors were correlated to an intra-arterial pressure catheter at the initial operation and at the time of sacrifice. Back-table sensor correlation with atmospheric pressure was done at the time of explantation. RESULTS: Three animals died during the follow-up period. Five animals were available for 6 -week follow-up, of which 3 survived for the complete 8 -week protocol. Two of the surviving animals had an intra-aortic sensor. All 5 aneurysm sac sensors functioned throughout the experimental period. At the time of sacrifice, the sacs contained a large amount of organized thrombus in which the sac sensors were deeply embedded. The 3 aortic sensors also functioned throughout the course of the experiments. The pressures correlated within 5 mmHg to the catheter-based measurements taken at the initial operation and at the time of sacrifice. Comparison to atmospheric pressure revealed no <b>calibration</b> <b>offset</b> in any sensor. CONCLUSIONS: This chronic implantation study demonstrates the durability of a remote, miniaturized pressure sensor within a surgically created aneurysm sac as well as the suprarenal aorta of a porcine AAA model. There was no <b>calibration</b> <b>offset</b> in any of the sensors, and they remained valid at explantation.
