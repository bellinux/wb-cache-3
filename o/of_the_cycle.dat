5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} connected graph is {{a subset of}} edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an edge in the subset when it has one endpoint {{on each side of}} the partition. Removing the edges of a cutset necessarily splits the graph into at least two connected components. A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper subset of the cutset is not itself a cut. A minimal cutset of a connected graph necessarily separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of edges that have one endpoint in each component. A simple cycle is a connected subgraph in which each vertex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> is incident to exactly two edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{citric acid}} cycle, all the {{intermediates}} (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate) are regenerated during each turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle.</b> Adding more {{of any of}} these intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that the additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence, the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, during the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle,</b> increase or decrease the amount of oxaloacetate available to combine with acetyl-CoA to form citric acid. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of ATP production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.|$|E

5|$|Acetyl-CoA, on {{the other}} hand, derived from {{pyruvate}} oxidation, or from the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, is the only fuel to enter the citric acid cycle. With each turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> one molecule of acetyl-CoA is consumed for every molecule of oxaloacetate present in the mitochondrial matrix, and is never regenerated. It is the oxidation of the acetate portion of acetyl-CoA that produces CO2 and water, with the energy thus released captured {{in the form of}} ATP.|$|E
5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle.</b> Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E

50|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basic {{results on}} {{symmetric}} groups says that any permutation {{can be expressed}} as <b>the</b> product <b>of</b> disjoint <b>cycles</b> (more precisely: cycles with disjoint orbits); such cycles commute with each other, and <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> permutation is unique up to <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycles.</b> <b>The</b> multiset <b>of</b> lengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycles</b> in this expression (<b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> type) is therefore uniquely determined by the permutation, and both the signature and <b>the</b> conjugacy class <b>of</b> <b>the</b> permutation in the symmetric group are determined by it.|$|R

5|$|The {{different}} levels of ovarian hormones at different stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> {{have been used to}} explain eating behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher. Additionally, with a high estrogen level dopamine is ineffective in converting to noradrenaline, a hormone which promotes eating, therefore decreasing appetite. In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence binge eating.|$|E
