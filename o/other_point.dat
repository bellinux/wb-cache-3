5|$|One <b>other</b> <b>point,</b> already mentioned, {{was how to}} {{deal with}} the problem of {{rendering}} the poem’s fourth line. Gray remarked to Anstey, “’That leaves the world to darkness and to me’ is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, I believe, you were in the right to drop it.” In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with a respectable Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same understated introduction of the narrator into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with other priorities, found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly.|$|E

5|$|Other {{remains of}} similar animals were found {{throughout}} the late 19th century and 20th century. Another well-preserved skeleton from the slightly older Horseshoe Canyon Formation, in Alberta, Canada, was named T. warreni by William Parks in 1926. This skeleton had notable differences from T. neglectus, and so Charles M. Sternberg placed it in a new genus, Parksosaurus, in 1937. Sternberg also named an additional species, T. edmontonensis, based on another articulated skeleton, this time including a partial skull (NMC8537), and {{drew attention to the}} genus' heavy build and thick bones. Due to these differences from the regular light hypsilophodont build, he suggested that the genus warranted its own subfamily, Thescelosaurinae. T. edmontonensis has, since Peter Galton's 1974 review, generally been considered a more robust individual (possibly the opposite sex of the type individual) of T. neglectus. However, Boyd and colleagues found that they could not assign it to either of their valid species of Thescelosaurus and regarded the specimen as of uncertain placement within the genus. The <b>other</b> <b>point</b> of contention regarding T. edmontonensis is its ankle, which Galton claimed was damaged and misinterpreted, but which was regarded by William J. Morris (1976) as truly different from T. neglectus.|$|E

25|$|The <b>other</b> <b>point</b> {{that leads}} to major controversy—because it could have {{significant}} economic impacts—is whether action (usually, restrictions {{on the use of}} fossil fuels to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions) should be taken now, or in the near future; and whether those restrictions would have any meaningful effect on global temperature.|$|E

25|$|Firstly, a metric space must be {{translationally}} invariant {{with respect}} to some (finite-dimensional) real vector space. This means that the space itself is an affine space, that the space is flat, not curved, and points do not have different properties, and so any point can be translated to any <b>other</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Swede Conny Palm in his 1943 {{dissertation}} {{studied the}} Poisson and <b>other</b> <b>point</b> {{processes in the}} one-dimensional setting by examining {{them in terms of}} the statistical or stochastic dependence between the points in time.

25|$|The North Pole, {{also known}} as the Geographic North Pole or Terrestrial North Pole, is the point in the Northern Hemisphere where Earth's axis of {{rotation}} meets its surface. This point is distinct from Earth's North Magnetic Pole. The South Pole is the <b>other</b> <b>point</b> where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface, in Antarctica.|$|E
25|$|The <b>other</b> <b>point</b> {{of view is}} geometrical. One can {{explicitly}} {{construct the}} spinors, and then examine how they behave under {{the action of the}} relevant Lie groups. This latter approach has the advantage of providing a concrete and elementary description of what a spinor is. However, such a description becomes unwieldy when complicated properties of spinors, such as Fierz identities, are needed.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{starting}} {{with just two}} distinct points, we can create a line or either of two circles (in turn, using each point as centre and passing through the <b>other</b> <b>point).</b> If we draw both circles, two new points are created at their intersections. Drawing lines between the two original points and one of these new points completes {{the construction of an}} equilateral triangle.|$|E

25|$|PGL(2, K) {{does not}} act 4-transitively on the {{projective}} line (except for PGL(2, 3), as P1(3) has 3+1=4 points, so 3-transitive implies 4-transitive); the invariant that is preserved is the cross ratio, and this determines where every <b>other</b> <b>point</b> is sent: specifying where 3 points are mapped determines the map. Thus in particular {{it is not}} the full collineation group of the projective line (except for F2 and F3).|$|E
25|$|Let X be a topological space. Then {{two points}} x and y in X are topologically {{distinguishable}} {{if they do}} not have exactly the same neighbourhoods (or equivalently the same open neighbourhoods); that is, {{at least one of them}} has a neighbourhood that is not a neighbourhood of the other (or equivalently there is an open set that one point belongs to but the <b>other</b> <b>point</b> does not).|$|E
25|$|Despite {{giving more}} respectability to the geocentric view than Newtonian physics does, {{relativity}} is not geocentric.

For this reason Robert Sungenis, a modern geocentrist, spent much of Volume I of his book Galileo Was Wrong: The Church Was Right critiquing and trying to unravel the Special and General theories of Relativity.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{the concept}} of {{distance}} is of practical interest for applications, while topological structure is needed for Palm distributions, meaning that point processes are usually defined on mathematical spaces with metrics. Furthermore, a realization of a point process {{can be considered as}} a counting measure, so points processes are types of random measures known as random counting measures. In this context, the Poisson and <b>other</b> <b>point</b> processes has been studied on a locally compact second countable Hausdorff space.|$|E
25|$|Angle is {{also used}} to {{designate}} the measure of an angle or of a rotation. This measure is the ratio of the length of a circular arc to its radius. In the case of a geometric angle, the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides. In the case of a rotation, the arc is centered {{at the center of the}} rotation and delimited by any <b>other</b> <b>point</b> and its image by the rotation.|$|E
25|$|Although models {{based on}} these and <b>other</b> <b>point</b> {{processes}} come closer to resembling reality in some situations, for example in the configuration of cellular base stations, they often suffer from a loss of tractability while the Poisson process greatly simplifies the mathematics and techniques, explaining its continued use for developing stochastic geometry models of wireless networks. Also, {{it has been shown}} that the SIR distribution of non-Poisson cellular networks can be closely approximated by applying a horizontal shift to the SIR distribution of a Poisson network.|$|E
