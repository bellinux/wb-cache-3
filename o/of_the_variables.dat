5|$|The 2-satisfiability {{problem is}} to find a truth {{assignment}} to these variables that makes the whole formula true. Such an assignment chooses whether to make each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variables</b> true or false, so that at least one literal to true in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying assignment is the one that sets all seven <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variables</b> to true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so this assignment satisfies every clause. There are also 15 other ways of setting all the variables so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.|$|E

50|$|In {{statistical}} modeling, {{regression analysis}} is a statistical process for estimating <b>the</b> relationships among <b>variables.</b> It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several <b>variables,</b> when <b>the</b> {{focus is on}} the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors'). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how <b>the</b> typical value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dependent <b>variable</b> (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> independent <b>variables</b> is varied, while <b>the</b> other independent <b>variables</b> are held fixed. Most commonly, regression analysis estimates <b>the</b> conditional expectation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dependent <b>variable</b> given <b>the</b> independent <b>variables</b> - that is, <b>the</b> average value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dependent <b>variable</b> when <b>the</b> independent <b>variables</b> are fixed. Less commonly, the focus is on a quantile, or other location parameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conditional distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dependent <b>variable</b> given <b>the</b> independent <b>variables.</b> In all cases, the estimation target is a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> independent <b>variables</b> called <b>the</b> regression function. In regression analysis, it is also of interest to characterize <b>the</b> variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dependent <b>variable</b> around <b>the</b> regression function which can be described by a probability distribution. A related but distinct approach is necessary condition analysis (NCA), which estimates the maximum (rather than average) value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dependent <b>variable</b> for a given value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> independent <b>variable</b> (ceiling line rather than central line) in order to identify what value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> independent <b>variable</b> is necessary but not sufficient for a given value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dependent <b>variable.</b>|$|R
