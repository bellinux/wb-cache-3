5|$|Highly {{combustible}} materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, {{were thought to}} be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.|$|E
5|$|To create Lou Bloom's character, Gilroy {{explored}} {{the ideas of}} unemployment and capitalism. He wanted to portray Lou as someone who perpetually focuses on the precepts of capitalism, and how these thoughts not only give him sanity, but also push him over the edge. Gilroy did not give Lou a character arc, as he believed that people develop their ideals {{at a certain point}} in their life, and that they stay that way regardless <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens.</b> This is depicted in the opening scene of the film, when Lou attacks a security guard, which informs the audience that Lou is a criminal, and not someone who lost their morality {{as a result of the}} job. Lou's backstory was purposefully left out of the script, as Gilroy felt that without one, the audience would create their own backstories for Lou, and become more engaged with the character. Gilroy remarked that Lou eventually became a vehicle for the ideas and themes that he wanted to express in the film.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} story, Nagisa is {{introduced}} {{to other students}} {{from each of the}} three schools; some she admires, some she is intimidated by, and some are merely friends encountered while attending St. Miator. The series encompasses the relationships the characters build with each other, climaxing whenever two of the characters start dating. The central focuses of Strawberry Panic! are the lesbian relationships and friendships between the girls from the three schools and the Etoile position and competition; the anime is more relationship-heavy while the manga is more competition-heavy. The story <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to the other half of St. Miator's Etoile pairing is explored in the latter portion of the anime. Depending on the media type, the depiction of the relationships between the girls is variously presented, with more explicit fan service– appealing visuals of the girls in provocative situations– in the anime adaptation than in the manga or light novels. A hint of astronomical star imagery is seen throughout the series, as well as minor Catholic religious undertones including a St. Mary statue on campus and a large Catholic church in the center of Astraea Hill.|$|E

25|$|Menopause {{has been}} {{observed}} in several species of nonhuman primates, including rhesus monkeys and chimpanzees.

25|$|The {{first and}} only episode, The Taxidermist, follows Madison as she visits Leland White, a taxidermist, to {{question}} him about the Origami Killer. Finding his house empty, Madison breaks in and discovers an upstairs area containing several female corpses, stuffed and posed in various positions (including a freshly killed cadaver in a bathroom), which Leland created {{in order to satisfy}} his agalmatophilia fetish. After collecting information, Madison hears Leland's car return. From here the player's actions can lead to several different endings – she can surprise Leland and kill him, be killed herself and added to his collection, escape, or contact the police and wait for them to arrest Leland. Regardless <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens,</b> it becomes clear that he has no connection to the Origami murders.|$|E

He tests the STL by entering a virtual reality cyberspace created with The Seed package, named UnderWorld (UW). In the UW, the flow of time proceeds a thousand times faster than in the real world, and Kirito's memories <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> inside are restricted. However, Black injures Kazuto with suxamethonium chloride. The MOD recovers Kazuto and places {{him back into the}} STL to preserve his mind while attempts are made to save him.|$|E
25|$|Medicine {{has existed}} for {{thousands}} of years, during most of which it was an art (an area of skill and knowledge) frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, {{since the advent of}} modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). While stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.|$|E

25|$|The {{distribution}} may {{be illustrated}} by the following urn model. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each white ball has the weight ω2. We {{will say that the}} odds ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. Now we are taking balls randomly {{in such a way that}} the probability of taking a particular ball is proportional to its weight, but independent <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to the other balls. The number of balls taken of a particular color follows the binomial distribution. If the total number n of balls taken is known then the conditional distribution of the number of taken red balls for given n is Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution. To generate this distribution experimentally, we have to repeat the experiment until it happens to give n balls.|$|E
25|$|During the turnaround, the {{traveling}} twin {{is in an}} accelerated reference frame. According to the equivalence principle, {{the traveling}} twin may analyze the turnaround phase as if the stay-at-home twin were freely falling in a gravitational field and as if the traveling twin were stationary. A 1918 paper by Einstein presents a conceptual sketch of the idea. From the viewpoint of the traveler, a calculation for each separate leg, ignoring the turnaround, leads to a result in which the Earth clocks age less than the traveler. For example, if the Earth clocks age 1day less on each leg, the amount that the Earth clocks will lag behind amounts to 2days. The physical description <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> at turnaround has to produce a contrary effect of double that amount: 4days' advancing of the Earth clocks. Then the traveler's clock {{will end up with}} a net 2-day delay on the Earth clocks, in agreement with calculations done in the frame of the stay-at-home twin.|$|E
25|$|Galitsky's {{followers}} sing his praise. Skula and Yeroshka are {{now working}} as gudok-players. They entertain the followers and all sing of how Galitsky and his men abducted a young woman and how she pleaded {{to be allowed to}} return to her father without being dishonoured. The prince arrives and sings of how, if he were Prince of Putivl, he would drink and feast all day while dispensing judgment and have the prettiest maidens with him all night (Galitsky's Song). The treasury would be spent on himself and his men while his sister would be praying in a monastery. A group of young women beg the prince to restore their abducted friend. He threatens them and drives them away, saying how she now lives in luxury in his quarters and does not have to work. The prince returns to his rooms having sent for wine for his followers. The gudok players and the prince's followers mock the women. They wonder what might happen if Yaroslavna hears <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens,</b> but then realise she would be helpless with all her men gone to war. They sing of how they are all drunkards and are supported by Galitsky. The men decide to go to the town square to declare Galitsky the Prince of Putivl, leaving just the two drunk musicians behind.|$|E
