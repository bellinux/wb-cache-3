5|$|In mammals, sexual {{differentiation}} {{is determined}} by the sperm that carries either an X or a Y (male) chromosome. The Y chromosome contains a sex-determining gene (SRY) that encodes a transcription factor for the protein tdf (testis determining factor) and triggers the creation <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> and Anti-Müllerian hormone for the embryo's development into a male. This differentiation begins about eight or nine weeks after conception. Some sources state that it continues until the twelfth week, while others state that it is clearly evident by the thirteenth week and that the sex organs are fully developed by the sixteenth week.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that commonly cause a high-androgen state, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. Conversely, people who lack androgenic hormones or are {{insensitive to the}} effects of androgens rarely have acne. An increase in androgen and oily sebum synthesis can be seen during pregnancy. Acne can be a side effect <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> replacement therapy or of anabolic steroid use. Over-the-counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements are commonly found to contain illegally added anabolic steroids.|$|E

5|$|If {{exposed to}} testosterone, the genital {{tubercle}} elongates {{to form the}} penis. By fusion of the urogenital folds– elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to the}} formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle– the urogenital sinus closes completely and forms the spongy urethra, and the labioscrotal swellings unite to form the scrotum. In the absence <b>of</b> <b>testosterone,</b> the genital tubercle allows for formation of the clitoris; the initially rapid growth of the phallus gradually slows and the clitoris is formed. The urogenital sinus persists as the vestibule of the vagina, the two urogenital folds form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia. A rare condition that can develop from higher than average androgen exposure is clitoromegaly.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, {{two studies}} further pinpointed the {{responsible}} region to chromosome 11 and a 4.5-Mb covering chromosomal rearrangement. The scientists {{were able to}} show that the first genetic change happened 3.8 million years ago on the resident chromosome, when a part of it broke off and was reintroduced in the wrong direction. This inversion created the faeder allele. About 500,000 years ago another rare recombination event of faeder and resident allele in the very same inverted region lead to the satellite allele. The 4.5 Mb inversion covers 90 genes, {{one of them is the}} centromere coding gene N- CENPN-, which is located exactly at one of the inversion breakpoints. The inactivation of the gene has severe deleterious effects and pedigree data of a captive ruff colony suggests that the inversion is homozygous lethal. Over the course of the past 3.8 million years, further mutations have accumulated within the inversion i.e. three deletions ranging from 3.3 to 17.6 kb. Two of these deletions remove evolutionary highly conserved elements close to two genes- HSD17B2 and SDR42E1-both holding important roles in metabolism of steroid hormones. Hormone measurements around mating time showed that whereas residents have a sharp increase <b>of</b> <b>testosterone,</b> faeders and satellites only experience higher androstenedione levels, a substance which is considered an intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis. The authors conclude that one or more of the deletions act as a cis-acting regulatory mutation which is altering the expression of one or both genes and eventually contributes to the different male phenotypes and behaviour.|$|E

25|$|Two of the {{immediate}} metabolites <b>of</b> <b>testosterone,</b> 5α-DHT and estradiol, are biologically important and can be formed both in the liver and in extrahepatic tissues. Approximately 5 to 7% <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> is converted by 5α-reductase into 5α-DHT, with circulating levels of 5α-DHT about 10% of those <b>of</b> <b>testosterone,</b> and approximately 0.3% <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> is converted into estradiol by aromatase. 5α-Reductase is highly expressed in the male reproductive organs (including the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and epididymides), skin, hair follicles, and brain and aromatase is highly expressed in adipose tissue, bone, and the brain. As much as 90% <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> is converted into 5α-DHT in so-called androgenic tissues with high 5α-reductase expression, and due to the several-fold greater potency of 5α-DHT as an AR agonist relative to testosterone, {{it has been estimated}} that the effects <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> are potentiated 2- to 3-fold in such tissues.|$|E
25|$|In {{cisgender}} men, abnormally high or {{low levels}} <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> are both associated with insulin resistance (which eventually can result in Type II diabetes). So mid-normal levels <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> are the target for androgen therapy.|$|E
25|$|Serum DHT {{levels are}} about 10% of those <b>of</b> <b>testosterone,</b> but {{levels in the}} {{prostate}} gland are 5- to 10-fold higher than those <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> due to a more than 90% conversion <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> into DHT by locally expressed 5α-reductase. For this reason, {{and in addition to}} the fact that DHT is much more potent as an AR agonist than is testosterone, DHT is considered to be the major androgen of the prostate gland.|$|E

25|$|Both {{testosterone}} and 5α-DHT are metabolized {{mainly in}} the liver. Approximately 50% <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> is metabolized via conjugation into testosterone glucuronide {{and to a lesser}} extent testosterone sulfate by glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases, respectively. An additional 40% <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> is metabolized in equal proportions into the 17-ketosteroids androsterone and etiocholanolone via the combined actions of 5α- and 5β-reductases, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and 17β-HSD, in that order. Androsterone and etiocholanolone are then glucuronidated {{and to a lesser extent}} sulfated similarly to testosterone. The conjugates <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> and its hepatic metabolites are released from the liver into circulation and excreted in the urine and bile. Only a small fraction (2%) <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> is excreted unchanged in the urine.|$|E

25|$|While a {{high level}} <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> is often {{associated}} with an increase in aggression, this is not a noticeable effect in most trans men.

These levels <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> have not been proven to cause more aggression than comparable levels of estrogen. It is assumed that the effect of the start of physical treatment is such a relief, and decreases pre-existing aggression so much, that the overall level of aggression actually decreases.|$|E
40|$|Aim was to {{determine}} if a serum levels <b>of</b> free <b>testosterone</b> and selected eight hormones are in correlation with potency and libido problems in aging male. Male population older then 45 years of two Slavonian villages was called for voluntary examination. Every patient filled a questionnaire concerning medical history, operations and potency and libido problems. Based on answers we formed six groups of patients, but only three were analyzed further. Population with potency and libido problems is on average older. In group of patients with normal potency and libido (PNLN group) average levels <b>of</b> free <b>testosterone</b> are 46. 01 pmol/L, LH 4. 62 IU/L and FSH 6. 20 IU/L. In group of patients with mild-damaged potency and normal libido (PMLN group) average levels <b>of</b> free <b>testosterone</b> are 44. 61 pmol/L, LH 6. 19 IU/L and FSH 8. 18 IU/L. In PALA group of patients with absent potency and libido (PALA group) average levels <b>of</b> free <b>testosterone</b> are 41, 89 pmol/L, LH 8. 07 IU/L and FSH 11. 27 IU/L. Significant higher levels of FSH and LH were found compared with the control group (for FSH p< 0. 0001 and p< 0. 003, and for LH p< 0. 003 and p< 0. 021). No significant difference in serum levels of free or binned testosterone were found between three groups.

40|$|An {{isolated}} {{deficiency of}} pituitary gonadotropins was demonstrated in six 46 XY males, 22 to 36 years of age, {{with and without}} anosmia. Undetectable or low levels of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) clearly separated hypogonadotropic from normal adult males. Chronic (8 - 12 wk) administration of clomiphene citrate caused no increase in serum FSH or LH in gonadotropin-deficient subjects. However, the administration of synthetic luteinizing hormone releasing factor (LRF) resulted in the appearance of serum LH and, to a lesser degree, serum FSH in three subjects tested. While levels <b>of</b> plasma <b>testosterone</b> were significantly lower in gonadotropin-deficient subjects, plasma androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone were in a range {{similar to that of}} age-matched normal men. Treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) increased levels <b>of</b> plasma <b>testosterone</b> to normal adult male values in all gonadotropin-deficient subjects. Cessation of treatment with HCG resulted in the return <b>of</b> plasma <b>testosterone</b> to low, pretreatment levels. That HCG therapy with resultant normal levels <b>of</b> plasma <b>testosterone</b> may somehow stimulate endogenous gonadotropin secretion in gonadotropin-deficient subjects was not evident. The adult male levels of serum FSH and LH after LRF, and plasma testosterone after HCG, confirm pituitary and Leydig cell responsiveness in these subjects...|$|R
25|$|The {{chemical}} synthesis <b>of</b> <b>testosterone</b> from cholesterol was achieved in August that year by Butenandt and Hanisch.

Testosterone {{was identified as}} 17β-hydroxyandrost-4-en-3-one (C19H28O2), a solid polycyclic alcohol with a hydroxyl group at the 17th carbon atom. This also made it obvious that additional modifications on the synthesized testosterone could be made, i.e., esterification and alkylation.|$|E
