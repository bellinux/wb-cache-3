[...] (Readiness activities are defined as all training activities and military operations related to combat and the testing of equipment for combat use.) The record in congress noted that [...] "A recent federal court ruling indicated that the Navy had violated the Migratory Bird Treaty Act by incidentally taking migratory birds without a permit during training exercises near Guam.

The <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> diets comprised <b>of</b> two different sets: trial 1 with the fluid first and trial 2 with the semi-solid food first.

In this paper we analyze Bayesian networks that have been derived from FIMs and report on several measurements, such as accuracy, relative probability of target diagnoses, diagnosis rank, and KL-divergence.

We {{attempt to reduce}} production testing time by presecuting a fault- driven methodology to handle LSI analog circuits in this paper. A fault-driven methodology {{has to be able}} to detect both parametric and catastrophic faults. For statistical performance simulation to detect parametric faults, we propose a two level approach because of the high cost of simulating LSI analog circuits statistically, where a set of primary statistical variables are first mapped to block performances by empirical models, derived by statistical regression techniques and then mapped to system performances using a behavioral simulator. For catastrophic fault simulation, open and short circuits are mapped to distortions in block performances by simulation and then mapped to system performances using a behavioral simulator. Using our statistical simulation technique for parametric variations and our fault simulation technique for catastrophic faults, we will minimize testing time using the algorithm in [1] by eliminating unnecessary specification tests and optimizing the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests.</b> The effectiveness and fault coverage of block level testing are also investigated...|$|E

Among various test-case prioritization techniques, the simple additional coverage-based technique, which is a greedy strategy, achieves surprisingly competitive empirical results. To investigate how much difference there is between the order produced by the additional technique and the optimal <b>order</b> in terms <b>of</b> coverage, we conduct a study on various empirical properties of optimal coverage-based test-case prioritization. To enable us to achieve the optimal order in acceptable time for our object programs, we formulate optimal coverage-based test-case prioritization as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Then we conduct an empirical study for comparing the optimal technique with the simple additional coverage-based technique. From this empirical study, the optimal technique can only slightly outperform the additional coverage-based technique with {{no statistically significant difference}} in terms of coverage, and the latter significantly outperforms the former in terms of either fault detection or execution time. As the optimal technique schedules the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases based on their structural coverage rather than detected faults, we further implement the ideal optimal test-case prioritization technique, which schedules the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases based on their detected faults.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the construct validity and reliability of the Modified Functional Obstacle Course (MFOC) and to examine the instrument’s intra-obstacle measurement parameters. METHODS: Participants (N = 63) performed a single series of three common fall risk assessments: Activity Specific Balance Confidence Scale; Dynamic Gait Index and the Tinetti Balance Test (ABC, DGI, 2 ̆ 6 TBT); and, the new Modified Functional Obstacle Course (MFOC).

40|$|Abstract—Test-case {{prioritization}} is {{to schedule}} the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases {{so as to}} maximize some objective (e. g., revealing faults early). The existing test-case prioritization ap-proaches separate the process of test-case prioritization {{and the process of}} test-case execution by presenting the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> all <b>test</b> cases before programmers start running test cases. As the execution information of the modified program is not available for the existing test-case prioritization approaches, these approaches mainly rely on only the execution information of the previous program before modification. To address this problem, we present an adaptive test-case prioritization approach, which determines the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases simultaneously during the execution <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases. In particular, the adaptive approach selects test cases based on their fault-detection capability, which is calculated based on the output <b>of</b> selected <b>test</b> cases. As soon as a test case is selected and runs, the fault-detection capability <b>of</b> each unselected <b>test</b> case is modified according to the output of the latest selected test case. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive approach, we conducted an experimental study on eight C programs and four Java programs. The experimental results show that the adaptive approach is usually significantly better than the total test-case prioritization approach and competitive to the additional test-case prioritization approach. Moreover, the adaptive approach is better than the additional approach on some subjects (e. g, replace and schedule).

40|$|Purpose: In {{a recent}} study, we {{demonstrated}} superior performance of Blue-on-Yellow pattern-onset multifocal VEP in identifying glaucomatous visual field defects {{as compared to}} black and white pattern-reversing checkerboard stimulation. We hypothesized that Blue-on-Yellow stimulation specifically targets non-redundant koniocellular visual pathways, enhancing identification of early losses. Current study was aimed at investigating comparative sensitivity of various pathways using temporally similar (pattern-onset) stimulus presentation technique. Methods: 23 patients with early perimetrically proven glaucoma (MD < 6 dB, repeatable defects) underwent mfVEP using three different pattern-onset stimulation conditions: high (98 %) luminance contrast achromatic (HC), low (50 %) luminance contrast achromatic (LC) and Blue-on-Yellow (BonY) stimulation to preferentially stimulate parvocellular, magmocellular and koniocellular pathways respectively. The <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> was randomized. Normal database (30 healthy subjects) was constructed for each test condition. Results: The HVF identified scotomas in 28 eyes of the 23 patients. 21 of the scotomas were identified by HC mfVEP (75 %), 26 were identified by BonY (93 %) and all 28 (100 %) by LC mfVEP. Comparison of defect severity using Accumap Severity Index (ASI) demonstrated largest averaged value for LC (62. 7 + 28. 5), followed by BonY (56. 5 + 28. 8) with HC showing less abnormality (41. 5 + 31. 5). ANOVA revealed {{significant differences between the}} groups, with LC and BonY ASI values significantly larger than HC (p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 01 respectively), but no significant difference between LC and BonY (p= 0. 16). Conclusions: Both BonY and LC achromatic mfVEP performed significantly better than HC pattern-onset stimulation in identifying early glaucomatous defects. Enhanced performance of BonY and LC may be attributed to non-redundancy of the koniocellular and magnocellular pathways. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Reconstructing the {{temporal}} order of events {{is a crucial}} part of episodic memory. The temporal dimension, however, is often discarded in clinical settings, and measurements of true temporal aspects of episodic memory are scarce. The present study assessed temporal memory in stroke patients and in age-and education-matched healthy controls. Both groups underwent a standardized neuropsychological examination. We asked participants afterwards to reconstruct the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> they had performed, measured in absolute temporal order (event placed on correct moment in sequence) and relative temporal order (event placed correctly relative to directly preceding and following events). The aim {{of the study was to}} examine how serial-position curve effects (measuring absolute temporal order anchored in exact time) and how relative temporal order memory (anchored to other events) may differ in a group of cerebral stroke patients. Another aim was to link temporal order memory deficits with established neuropsychological measures of cognitive functioning. Although item identification was comparable in both groups, absolute temporal order memory was impaired in patients: A total of 43 % of the patients lacked the expected primacy and recency effects (serial position effect). In addition, relative temporal order memory was affected in this group as well, F(1, 70) = 4. 08, p <. 05; 25 % of the patients were impaired in reconstructing the relative temporal order (p =. 019, Fishers Exact Test). Both absolute and relative temporal order memory performance related to the domains of executive functioning and memory.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether a serotonin blocker, sarpogrelate, improves exercise capacity as a result of vasodilation of coronary collateral channels in patients with effort angina. Background. Serotonin has been reported to decrease coronary collateral blood flow by collateral vasoconstriction in a canine model, suggesting that platelet activation in feeding coronary arteries of the collateral network has the potential to cause collateral vasoconstriction. Methods. The subjects consisted of 22 patients with effort angina and reproducible ischemic threshold (group A, 11 patients with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade 2 or 3 flow of the ischemia-related coronary artery and Rentrop’s collateral index 0 or 1; group B, 11 patients with TIMI grade 0 or 1 flow and Rentrop’s collateral index 2 or 3). We repeated the symptom-limited treadmill exercise test using the Balke–Ware protocol and exercise tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with and without pretreatment with 200 mg orally administered sarpogrelate. Each exercise test was performed at 9 : 00 a. m. on different days. The <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> with and without sarpogrelate was randomized. Results. In group A, sarpogrelate increased neither exercise time at 0. 1 mV ST depression nor double product at 0. 1 mV ST depression. In contrast, in group B sarpogrelate increased the exercise duration at 0. 1 mV ST depression from 181 ± 112 (SD) to 248 ± 131 s (p < 0. 05) and also increased the double product at 0. 1 mV ST depression by 21 % (p < 0. 01). The severity score using myocardial perfusion scintigraphy at the same workload was significantly (p < 0. 01) decreased by 37 % in group B, but not in group A (11 %), due to the sarpogrelate treatment. Conclusions. Sarpogrelate augments flow reserve of the collateral circulation and improves exercise capacity in anginal patients with well-developed collaterals.

30|$|Optimal. Empirical {{evaluations}} frequently {{include this}} technique as {{upper bound on}} the effectiveness of the other techniques. It presents the best result that a technique is able to achieve. To obtain the best result, for example, for failure detection purposes, the failure record must be available. Since the target information may not be available in practice, the technique is not feasible. Thus, we can only use applications with known failures. Therefore, we can determine the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases that maximizes the rate of failure detection <b>of</b> a <b>test</b> suite.|$|R

40|$|The {{techniques}} <b>of</b> <b>test</b> case prioritization schedule {{the execution}} <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases to attain re-spective target, such as enhanced level of forecasting the fault. The {{requirement of the}} prioritiza-tion {{can be viewed as}} the en-route for deriving an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> relation on a given set <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases which results from regression <b>testing.</b> Alteration <b>of</b> programs between the versions can cause more test cases which may respond differently to following versions of software. In this, a fixed approach to prioritizing test cases avoids the preceding drawbacks. The JUnit test case prioritiza-tion techniques operating in the absence of coverage information, differs from existing dynamic coverage-based test case prioritization techniques. Further, the prioritization test cases relying on coverage information were projected from fixed structures relatively other than gathered instru-mentation and execution...|$|R
30|$|Test case {{prioritization}} techniques aim at defining an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> {{cases that}} favor {{the achievement of}} a goal during test execution, such as revealing failures as earlier as possible. A number of techniques have already been proposed and investigated in the literature and experimental results have discussed whether a technique is more successful than others. However, in the context <b>of</b> model-based <b>testing,</b> only a few {{attempts have been made}} towards either proposing or experimenting test case prioritization techniques. Moreover, a number of factors that may influence on the results obtained still need to be investigated before more general conclusions can be reached.|$|R
40|$|The {{fraction}} of faults detected for a digital network is frequently {{high for the}} first few input combinations applied out of a set <b>of</b> <b>test</b> vectors. When the particular <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> patterns does not appreciably change the shape of the coverage curve, there appears to be an advantage to splitting the test into segments which are applied at different times. It is shown that the expected time to error detection and the probability of an undetected double error can be reduced. The amount of reduction is dependent on the shape of the fault coverage curve. It is conjectured that such a reduction can be obtained for VLSI networks...|$|R
40|$|The aim <b>of</b> <b>test</b> case {{prioritisation}} is {{to determine}} an <b>ordering</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases that maximises the likelihood of early fault revelation. Previous prioritisation techniques {{have tended to be}} single objective, for which the additional greedy algorithm is the current state-of-the-art. Unlike test suite minimisation, multi objective test case prioritisation has not been thoroughly evaluated. This paper presents an extensive empirical study of the effectiveness <b>of</b> multi objective <b>test</b> case prioritisation, evaluating it on multiple versions of five widely-used benchmark programs and a much larger real world system of over 1 million lines of code. The paper also presents a lossless coverage compaction algorithm that dramatically scales the performance of all algorithms studied by between 2 and 4 <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> magnitude, making prioritisation practical for even very demanding problems.
