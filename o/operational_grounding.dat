40|$|Design {{and study}} of {{operational}} performance of convective industrial dryers are a strong indicator {{in the last}} stages of the selection procedure. This problem is addressed in a straightforward way for the three most popular types; conveyor-belt, fluidized bed and rotary dryers. Design {{was carried out by}} appropriately optimizing the total annual cost of each configuration for a given production capacity. All dryer types were compared explicitely by evaluating optimal configurations {{for a wide range of}} production capacity values. Once the dryer configuration is specified, its optimal operational performance was evaluated by comparing the optimum operational cost versus production capacity for predefined optimal designed structures. Rotary dryers turned to be rather expensive compared to fluidized bed dryers, regarding design. On <b>operational</b> <b>grounds,</b> however, it is the other way around due to the understandably favored heat transfer achieved in rotary dryers. Conveyor-belt dryers, when utilized, lie somewhere in between producing satisfactory results both on design and on <b>operational</b> <b>grounds.</b> A characteristic example of food dehydration process is included, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

Error modeling and propagation methodology is developed for each link in the imaging chain, and representative values are determined {{for the purpose of}} exercising the model and observing the system behavior in response {{to a wide variety of}} inputs. Three distinct approaches to modelbased atmospheric inversion are compared in a common reflectance error space, where each contributor to the overall error in retrieved reflectance is examined in relation to the others. The modeling framework also allows for performance predictions resulting from the incorporation of <b>operational</b> <b>ground</b> truth measurements. Regimes were identified in which uncertainty in water vapor and aerosols were each found to dominate error contributions to final retrieved reflectance. Cloud cover was also shown to be a significant contributor, while state-of-the-industry hyperspectral sensors were confirmed to not be error drivers. Accordingly, instruments for measuring water vapor, aerosols, and downwelled sky radiance were identified as key to improving reflectance retrieval beyond current performance by current inversion algorithms...|$|R

This is followed by arguments raised regarding its general nature, and consequently, the applicability of the model to China based on common structural and <b>operational</b> <b>grounds.</b> Finally, I will reveal that behind the robust common ground, the different structural specifics may give rise to the divergent development paths. The primary focus is theoretical, with empirical examples provided. Consistent empirical analysis based on the model will be a following undertaking...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{theory is}} a {{mathematical}} formalism to compute probabilities for outcomes happenning in physical experiments. These outcomes constitute events happening in space-time. One {{of these events}} represents {{the fact that a}} system located in the region of space where is situated a physical device has a certain value of a physical observable at the time when the device fires the outcome corresponding to that value of the observable. The causal structure of these events is customarily assumed fixed in an absolute way. In this paper we show that this assumption cannot be substantiated on <b>operational</b> <b>grounds</b> proving that two observers looking at the same quantum experiment can calculate the probabilities of the experiment assuming a different causal structure for the space-time events constituted by the outcomes. We will thus say that in quantum theory we have relativity of causal structure. Comment: 5 page...|$|R

In one simple model the algebra is a Clifford algebra with 6 N generators. The quantum imaginary ¯hi is the contraction of a dynamical variable whose back-reaction provides the Dirac mass.

On <b>operational</b> <b>grounds</b> the non-locality is ∼ 10 − 25 sec in size and the associated mass is about the Higgs mass.
