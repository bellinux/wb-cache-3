5|$|A {{shortage}} of transport aircraft {{meant that it}} would take three days to transport the division to Arnhem. The plan called {{for the majority of the}} 1st Airlanding Brigade and the 1st Parachute Brigade to land <b>on</b> <b>day</b> <b>one.</b> The parachute brigade would head for Arnhem and capture the bridges over the Lower Rhine while the airlanding brigade secured drop zones for units arriving on the second and third days. When all the division's units had arrived the brigade would take up defensive positions to the west of Arnhem. The 1st Airlanding Brigade units arriving on the second lift were to be two companies plus one mortar, one machine gun and one anti-tank platoon of the Staffords, along with three platoons and sections from the mortar, machine gun and anti-tank platoons of the KOSB. The Borders contingent amounted to a further eight platoons.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the Normandy {{invasion}} included five assault landings {{from the}} sea, supported by airborne landings on both flanks by British and American airborne divisions. In {{what would be}} its first action, the 6th Airborne Division was chosen {{to land on the}} left flank of the British landing zone. Its primary objective <b>on</b> <b>day</b> <b>one</b> was to capture intact two bridges over the Caen canal and the River Orne. The division's secondary objective was the destruction of the Merville gun battery, which could engage ships landing nearby at Sword. To prevent German reinforcements approaching the invasion area from the east, 6th Airborne also had to destroy the bridges crossing the River Dives then dig in around Ranville and hold the left flank of the advance.|$|E
5|$|Shiloh's {{importance}} as a Civil War battle, {{coupled with the}} lack of widespread agricultural or industrial development in the battle area after the war, led to its development {{as one of the first}} five battlefields restored by the federal government in the 1890s. Government involvement eventually proved insufficient to preserve the land on which the battle took place. (The federal government had saved just over 2,000 acres at Shiloh by 1897, and consolidated those gains by adding another 1,700 acres by 1954.) Preservation eventually slowed. Since 1954, only 300 additional acres of the saved land had been preserved. Private preservation organizations stepped in to fill the void. The Civil War Trust became the primary agent of these efforts, preserving 1,158 acres at Shiloh since its inception. The land preserved by the Trust at Shiloh included tracts over which Confederate divisions passed as they fought Grant's men on the battle's first day and their retreat during the Union counteroffensive on day two. A 2012 campaign focused in particular on a section of land which was part of the Confederate right flank <b>on</b> <b>day</b> <b>one</b> and on several tracts which were part of the Battle of Fallen Timbers.|$|E

40|$|Background Antiemetic {{guidelines}} recommend co-administration {{of agents}} {{to maximize the}} prevention of chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting (CINV), however, the control of delayed CINV is still not satisfactory. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of thalidomide in the prevention of CINV. Methods Of 89 patients enrolled, 83 chemotherapy-naïve patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (cisplatin 70 mg/m 2) were randomized into two groups: standard therapy group (ondansetron <b>on</b> <b>day</b> 1, metoclopramide and dexamethasone <b>on</b> <b>days</b> <b>one</b> to five) and thalidomide group (in addition to standard emesis prevention, patients received oral 100 mg thalidomide <b>on</b> <b>days</b> <b>one</b> to five). Patients recorded nausea and vomiting episodes in a diary. The primary end point was the efficacy of thalidomide in controlling vomiting and nausea <b>on</b> <b>days</b> <b>one</b> to five post cisplatin, and the secondary end point was the safety of the thalidomide. Results No significant differences of complete response rates (no emesis, no use of rescue therapy and no nausea) were observed between the two groups, while the percentages of patients with complete response of delayed vomiting <b>on</b> <b>day</b> four and day five were higher in the thalidomide group, furthermore, the complete response rate of delayed nausea for thalidomide group and standard therapy group showed significant differences. Thalidomide group showed a similar safety profile as standard emesis prevention group. Conclusion Addition of thalidomide was generally well tolerated and improved prevention of CINV in patients receiving cisplatinbased chemotherapy to some degree, especially for delayed nausea...|$|R
