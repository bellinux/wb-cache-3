40|$|One of the {{problems}} for studies of large scale structures in nearby space (cz < 10, 000 km/s) {{is the presence of}} the Zone of Avoidance which is so large and wide on the sky that potentially important clusters and large voids have remained undetected. A prime example was the Ophiuchus cluster (cz = 8, 500 km/s), discovered by Wakamatsu and Malkan (1981) as a heavily obscured cD cluster close to the Galactic centre region (l = 0. 5 º, b = + 9. 5 º) and is the 2 nd brightest X-ray cluster after the Perseus cluster (Okamura, 1991). A hidden galaxy survey was performed by visually searching ESO/SERC Sky Survey (R and J) copy films of the region centred at l = 355 º, b = + 10 º finding more than 4000 galaxies in 6 fields. Several irregular clusters adjacent to Ophiuchus were found forming an <b>Ophiuchus</b> <b>supercluster</b> which may itself be connected to the Hercules supercluster by a wall structure parallel to the local supergalactic plane (Wakamatsu et al. 1994). In front of this supercluster, an ‘Ophiuchus Void’ is suggested (cz = 4, 500 km/s). The <b>Ophiuchus</b> <b>supercluster</b> at cz = 8, 500 km/s is similar to the Hercules supercluster (cz = 11, 000 km/s), and extends to the north toward the latter supercluster...|$|E
40|$|The Ophiuchus Cluster {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{luminous}} X-ray clusters in the local Universe, and may be a key cluster for the local large-scale structure. Our preliminary redshift-survey with FLAIR and 6 dF for the cluster shows the following: 1) a velocity dispersion of the Ophiuchus cluster is found to be 1050 ± 50 km s- 1, which is consistent with its large X-ray luminosity, 2) the cluster accompanies several clusters and groups of galaxies within a distance of 8 ° from the cluster centre, implying that it is a large and massive enough to be classified as a supercluster, 3) from its closeness to the position of the Great Attractor in the sky, the <b>Ophiuchus</b> <b>Supercluster</b> may play some role in its gravitational potential, as may the Shapley Concentration, and 4) there is an extensive foreground void up to cz≈ 4000 km s- 1 in the survey area, implying that it is a continuation of the Local Void...|$|E
