40|$|<b>On-line</b> <b>supported</b> liquid {{membrane}} (SLM) extraction and microporous membrane liquid-liquid extraction (MMLLE) techniques for sample preparation of natural water samples {{have been developed}} for the determination of thiophanate-methyl (TM), carbendazim (MBC) and 2 -aminobenzimidazole (2 -AB) using reversed-phase HPLC. The combination of SLM extraction and MMLLE offers extraction conditions that makes it possible to determine a wide variety of compounds, i. e., permanently charged, ionisable and non-polar at sub ppb level. The detection limits obtained after extraction are about 0. 1 μg/l for MBC and 2 -AB using SLM, and 0. 5 μg/l for TM using MMLLE and the precision is better than 5 % for both systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT By {{screening}} all the {{ligand binding}} {{sites in the}} Protein Data Bank, {{we have found that}} while it is geometrically possible that a loop, formed from a protein-chain with residues ZYX would "impersonate" another chain-loop with residues XYZ by a simple twisting of either the loop or the bound ligand, it almost never happens. This fact is rather surprising, and implies a notable asymmetry, since (i) loops in the folded proteins sometimes can be flexible enough to be twisted, but (ii) ligands are almost always extremely mobile before binding to the protein, therefore they can turn around and bind to residue-sequence ZYX as well. Data availability: The <b>on-line</b> <b>supporting</b> Table 3 lists the appearances of the residue-sequences and their inverses in the binding sites of the whole PDB. Introduction: The fast growing Protein Data Bank 1 contains the three-dimensional structures of more than 50, 000 entries today.
