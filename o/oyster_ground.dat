40|$|In the {{framework}} of ‘BIOMON’, a national program for biological monitoring of marine waters, the invertebrate benthic fauna of the Dutch Continental Shelf (DCS) has been monitored from 1991 onwards. The monitoring {{is based on a}} boxcore sampling program yearly carried out in spring at 100 stations on the DCS. The aim is to generate a time series that can form a basis to detect possible trends in the development of thefauna in different areas within the DCS. From the very beginnng it became clear that in the fauna of the DCS four clusters could be discerned that are geographically well defined: the Dogger Bank, the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground,</b> the southern offshore area and the coastal area. At the community level there were no trendwise changes over the period of monitoring. Species diversity was consistently highest at the Dogger Bank and in the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground,</b> on average twice as high as in the southern offshore and coastal areas. Faunal densities were generally the highest in the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground.</b> The highest biomass values were found in the coastal area, due to the presence of banks of bivalves (Spisula subtruncata and Ensis americanus). At the species level a few trends were observed: the disappearance of the polychaete Aricidea minuta from the DCS around 2000 and a dip in the densities of the brittle star Amphiura filiformis in the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground</b> {{during the second half of}} the nineties. A rather strong decrease of silt contents of the sediment in the latter area after 2001 was not reflected in a change in the abundance of one or more common species. A comparison of the monitoring data with data collected in the period 1975 – 1981 appeared to be possible for only a few (mainly mollusc) species in the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground,</b> but indicated that the gastropod Turritella communis has strongly decreased since those years whereas there was a significant increase in the abundance of several small bivalve species...|$|E
40|$|The {{vertical}} color {{transition from}} brown to gray-green in marine sediments {{is linked to}} the Fe redox boundary and is commonly used as a proxy for biogeochemical state. We combine time-lapse sediment profile imaging with diffusive gradient thin (DGT) gels to obtain simultaneous in situ measurements of sediment color profiles, pore-water Fe and Mn profiles, and qualitative estimates of faunal activity at the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground</b> and North Dogger (North Sea). Analysis of Fe and Mn profiles using generalized additive modeling reveals that high variability between profiles within the sites makes it difficult to determine any intersite differences in trace metal behavior. At the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground,</b> the depth of sediment color transition (4. 78 +/- 0. 76 cm) was not significantly different from the Fe redox boundary (7. 67 +/- 4. 04 cm). At the North Dogger, there was a significant discrepancy between the depth of the sediment color transition (2. 86 +/- 0. 78 cm) and the Fe redox boundary (10. 17 +/- 1. 04 cm), which most likely results from high sulfate reduction rates at the North Dogger, leading to complexation of reduced iron to a form not available to the DGT technique. The differences in the coupling of sediment color and the Fe redox boundary between stations is likely to be related to variations in recent infaunal bioturbation activity, rather than variations in sediment source or fundamental differences in bulk sediment chemistry. Our results highlight the importance of the infaunal community in mediating Fe and Mn cycles, which are key pathways in the degradation of organic matter, and suggest that descriptions of bulk chemistry alone may be insufficient to understand the dynamics of biogeochemical cycling...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new {{results from}} high temporal resolution observations {{over two years}} (2007 and 2008) from instrumented moorings deployed in the central North Sea, at the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Grounds</b> and on the northern slope of Dogger Bank (North Dogger). The water column was stratified in the summer at both sites, leading to limited exchange {{of the water in}} the bottom mixed layer. Data from these moorings revealed the variable nature of summer oxygen depletion at the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Grounds.</b> The combination of in situ and ship-based measurements allowed the physical and biological conditions leading to decreasing dissolved oxygen concentrations in bottom water to be examined. In 2007 and 2008, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the bottom water at both sites was observed to decrease throughout the summer period after the onset of stratification. Depleted dissolved oxygen concentration (6. 5 mg l− 1, 71 % saturation) was measured at the North Dogger, a site which is not significantly influenced by anthropogenic nutrient inputs. Lower oxygen saturation (5. 2 mg l− 1, 60 % saturation) was measured for short durations at the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Grounds.</b> The seasonal increase in bottom water temperature accounted for 55 % of the decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration at the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Grounds</b> compared to 10 % at North Dogger. Dissolved oxygen concentration in bottom water at the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Grounds</b> was shown to be strongly influenced by short term events including storms and pulses of particulate organic matter input. In contrast, dissolved oxygen concentration in bottom water at the North Dogger reflected longer seasonal processes such as a gradual temperature increase over the summer and a more steady supply of particulate organic matter to the bottom mixed layer. The differences between the study sites shows the need for an improved understanding of the mechanisms driving these processes if the use of oxygen in marine management and ensuring ecosystem health is to be meaningful and successful in the future. These high frequency observations provide greater {{understanding of the nature of}} the depletion in bottom oxygen concentration in the North Sea...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} {{the results are}} {{presented}} of a macrobenthos survey on the Dutch Continental Shelf (DCS), carried out in spring 2001. The survey forms part of the 'Biological monitoring programme of marine waters' (MON*BIOLOGIE, generally referred to as 'BIOMON') which was initiated by the National Institute for Coastal and Marine Management (RIKZ). The purpose of the programme is to obtain insight into the year-to-year variations of the macrobenthic assemblages and to detect trend-like changes, that possibly indicate anthropogenic influences on the marine environment (e. g. eutrophication, pollution, beam-trawl fishery). Within the framework of this project fieldwork is carried out every year in spring. In 2001 the 100 BIOMON stations were sampled in the period between February 27 and April 4. On {{the basis of the}} results collected in 2001 and previous years an analysis is made of the trends and fluctuations of some selected species and of basic community attributes over the period 1986 - 2001. The community attributes studied were the diversity, abundance and biomass of the total macrofauna and of the 4 major taxonomic groups. Temporal variation or trends were investigated separately {{for each of the four}} subareas in the DCS i. e. the Coastal, Offshore areas, Dogger Bank and <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground.</b> The conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows: 1. The sediment composition in the four subareas was quite similar to that found in previous years. Also at most of the individual stations the median grain size and silt content of the sediment had hardly changed. There were only three stations with strong year to year differences in sediment composition. At the stations OFF 2 and OFF 6 the median grain size strongly fluctuated and at station OYS 8 the silt content. lt is suggested that these stations are situated at a sharp local gradient. 2. At the community level, there were only a few slight changes compared to preceding years. In the offshore area and in the coastal area there seemed to be a tendency for increased diversity. This was not due to increased species richness but to a more even distribution in the abundance of the various species. With respect to the share of the different taxonomic groups to the total biomass, a decrease has been observed in previous years in molluscs, particularly at the Dogger Bank and in the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground.</b> This decrease has come to an end in 2001 and turned into an increase. Since molluscs also increased numerically, the increase in biomass is caused by higher densities rather than by a larger size of the animals. 3. At the Dogger Bank a few species showed a remarkable decrease. The polychaete Nephtys cirrosa shows a decrease from 2000 onwards, the sand star Acrocnida brachiata and the bivalve Mysella bidentata from 1999 and the polychaete Aricidea minuta decreased in 1997 and has no longer been found since 1999. On the other hand the population density of the gastropod Euspira nitida (formerly called Natica alderi) had recovered from a dip in the period 1998 - 2000. The occurrence of Ensis phaxoides is new for the Dogger Bank. Further, living specimens of the bivalve Gouldia minima and the gastropod Turbonilla pusilla have not been found on the DCS before. 4. In the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground</b> the decreasing trend that has been observed in previous years in the brittle star Amphiura filiformis and the polychaete Nephtys hombergii had turned into au increase in 2001. However, densities of A. filiformis were still low at the Frisian Front. There was a number of species that have not been found before during the BIOMON programma. The occurrence of the polychaete Nephtys assimilis is new for the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground.</b> The records of the polychaete Sabella penicillus, the bivalves Montacuta tenella and Gari costulata and the gastropods Turbonilla pusilla and Roxania utriculus are probably new to the DCS. 5. In the offshore area, a slightly increasing trend that has been observed in the sea urchin Echinocardium cordatum in the preceding years has come to an end in 2001. In contrast, the gastropod Euspira nitida showed a recovery of populations from 2000 onwards. Station OFF 33 that in 2000 had shown a rich fauna that was clearly different from the other stations in the offshore area was still rich in 2001, but the fauna composition did not show 'exotic' elements. 6. In the Coastal area there seemed to be a recovery of the populations of the gastropod Euspira nitida. After an 8 year period of very low densities the species returned at 5 stations, albeit in low numbers. The bivalve Tellina fabula also showed a steady increase, after a dip in the second half of the nineties. At stations where banks of Spisula subtruncata or Ensis americanus occurred, biomass values were very high...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{structure}} and interrelationships of North Sea benthic invertebrate and fish communities and their underlying environmental drivers is an important prerequisite for conservation and spatial ecosystem management on scales relevant to ecological processes. Datasets of North Sea infauna, epifauna, and demersal fish (1999 – 2002) were compiled and analysed to (i) identify and compare spatial patterns in community structure, and (ii) relate these to environmental variables. The multivariate analyses revealed significantly similar large-scale patterns in all three components with major distinctions between a southern community (<b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground</b> and German Bight), an eastern Channel and southern coastal community, {{and at least one}} northern community (> 50 m deep). In contrast, species diversity patterns differed between the components with a diversity gradient for infauna and epifauna decreasing from north to south, and diversity hotspots of demersal fish, e. g. near the major inflows of Atlantic water.

However, it is still not clear which environmental parameters control the diversity and community structure of sedimentary microorganisms mediating important ecosystem processes. In this study, multiscale patterns were elucidated at seven stations in the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground,</b> North Sea (54 ° 4 'N/ 4 °E), 100 m to 11 km apart. These were related to biotic (e. g. multicellular organisms) and abiotic parameters (e. g. organic carbon content in the sediment) to establish the relationship between the distribution of both bacterial and archaeal communities and their environment. A relatively high variability was detected at all scales for bacterial and archaeal communities, both of which were controlled by different suites of biotic and abiotic environmental variables. The bacterial community consisted mainly of members belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria and the Fibrobacteres/Acidobacteria group.

We present here series of Delta C- 14 excess from known-age annual increments of the long-lived bivalve mollusk Arctica islandica from 4 sites across the coastal North Atlantic (German Bight, North Sea; Tromso, north Norway; Siglufjordur, north Icelandic shelf; Grimsey, north Icelandic shelf) combined with published series from Georges Bank and Sable Bank (NW Atlantic) and the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground</b> (North Sea). The atmospheric bomb pulse {{is shown to}} be a step-function whose response in the marine environment is immediate but of smaller amplitude and which has a longer decay time {{as a result of the}} much larger marine carbon reservoir. Attenuation is determined by the regional hydrographic setting of the sites, vertical mixing, processes controlling the isotopic exchange of C- 14 at the air-sea boundary, C- 14 content of the freshwater flux, primary productivity, and the residence time of organic matter in the sediment mixed layer. The inventories form a sequence from high magnitude-early peak (German Bight) to low magnitude-late peak (Grimsey). All series show a rapid response to the increase in atmospheric Delta C- 14 excess but a slow response to the subsequent decline resulting from the succession of rapid isotopic air-sea exchange followed by the more gradual isotopic equilibration in the mixed layer due to the variable marine carbon reservoir and incorporation of organic carbon from the sediment mixed layer. The data constitute calibration series for the use of the bomb pulse as a high-resolution dating tool in the marine environment and as a tracer of coastal ocean water masses...|$|E
40|$|For {{understanding}} and forecasting of hydrodynamics in coastal regions, numerical models {{have served as}} an important tool for many years. In order to assess the model performance, we compared simulations to observational data of water temperature and salinity. Observations were available from FerryBox transects in the southern North Sea and, additionally, from a fixed platform of the MARNET network. More detailed analyses have been made at three different stations, located off the English eastern coast, at the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground</b> and in the German Bight. FerryBoxes installed on ships of opportunity (SoO) provide high-frequency surface measurements along selected tracks on a regular basis. The results of two operational hydrodynamic models have been evaluated for two different time periods: BSHcmod v 4 (January 2009 to April 2012) and FOAM AMM 7 NEMO (April 2011 to April 2012). While they adequately simulate temperature, both models underestimate salinity, especially near the coast in the southern North Sea. Statistical errors differ between the two models and between the measured parameters. The {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) of water temperatures amounts to 0. 72 °C (BSHcmod v 4) and 0. 44 °C (AMM 7), while for salinity the performance of BSHcmod is slightly better (0. 68 compared to 1. 1). The study results reveal weaknesses in both models, in terms of variability, absolute levels and limited spatial resolution. Simulation of the transition zone between the coasts and the open sea is still a demanding task for operational modelling. Thus, FerryBox data, combined with other observations with differing temporal and spatial scales, can serve as an invaluable tool not only for model evaluation, but also for model optimization by assimilation of such high-frequency observations...|$|E

Within the European FerryBox Community, several FerryBoxes are operated by different institutions. Here we present a comparison of model simulations applied to the North Sea with FerryBox temperature and salinity data from a transect along the southern North Sea and a more detailed analysis at three different positions located off the English East coast, at the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground</b> and in the German Bight. In addition to the FerryBox data, data from a Fixed Platform of the MARNET network are applied. Two operational hydrodynamic models have been evaluated for different time periods: results of BSHcmod v 4 are analysed for 2009 – 2012, while simulations of FOAM AMM 7 NEMO have been available from MyOcean data base for 2011 and 2012. The simulation of water temperatures is satisfying; however, limitations of the models exist, especially near the coast in the southern North Sea, where both models are underestimating salinity. Statistical errors differ between the models and the measured parameters, as the {{root mean square error}} (rmse) accounts for BSHcmod v 4 to 0. 92 K, for AMM 7 only to 0. 44 K. For salinity, BSHcmod is slightly better than AMM 7 (0. 98 and 1. 1 psu, respectively). The study results reveal weaknesses of both models, in terms of variability, absolute levels and limited spatial resolution.

40|$|The {{fixation}} of dinitrogen (N 2) and denitrification are two opposite {{processes in}} the nitrogen cycle. The former transfers atmospheric dinitrogen gas into bound nitrogen in the biosphere, while the latter returns this bound nitrogen back to atmospheric dinitrogen. It is unclear {{whether or not these}} processes are intimately connected in any microbial ecosystem or that they are spatially and/or temporally separated. Here, we measured seafloor nitrogen fixation and denitrification as well as pelagic nitrogen fixation by using the stable isotope technique. Alongside, we measured the diversity, abundance, and activity of nitrogen-fixing and denitrifying microorganisms at three stations in the southern North Sea. Nitrogen fixation ranged from undetectable to 2. 4 nmol N L- 1 d- 1 and from undetectable to 8. 2 nmol N g- 1 d- 1 in the water column and seafloor, respectively. The highest rates were measured in August at Doggersbank, both for the water column and for the seafloor.

40|$|The hyperbenthos of the Frisian front, an enriched benthic {{area of the}} {{southern}} North Sea, and surrounding waters was investigated along two cross-frontal transects in August 1994 and April 1996. A total of 111 species was recorded, mainly peracarid crustaceans and decapods. On average, Calanus spp. (Copepoda), Schistomysis ornata (Mysidacea) and Scopelocheirus hopei (Amphipoda) represented more than 40 % of the total density, while S. ornata constituted 30 % of the biomass. Community structure differed strongly between the two months, {{as shown by the}} species composition and the much lower densities and biomasses in April. In August, the density of the holohyperbenthic fraction reached pronounced peaks in the Frisian front area: densities for chaetognaths, copepods, amphipods and mysids were one order of magnitude higher than in the surrounding waters. Diversity was also highest at the Frisian front. The high abundances may be explained by active migration and/or by passive transport to the food-enriched area. Merohyperbenthic species showed a less distinct increase in density in the front zone, but a clear south-to-north change in community structure was observed. These species are more heavily subjected to the prevailing tidal flow. The Frisian front fauna seems to be transitional between two merohyperbenthic communities established in late summer, one belonging to the environmentally different sandy Southern Bight to the south, the other to the silty <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground</b> to the north. In spring, no such hyperbenthic enrichment over the Frisian front was observed. This is most probably due to the strong seasonality of the hyperbenthic fauna and the low water temperature, suggesting that production and subsequent recruitment had not started yet. Alternatively, winter storms could have resuspended particulate organic matter, followed by a rapid migration of the motile hyperbenthos to more northern depositional areas and thus leading to a temporal density decline. We conclude that the Frisian front is an enriched area for the hyperbenthos at the end of summer, as has already been reported for the benthic system...|$|E
40|$|The {{continental}} {{margins of}} the southern North Sea and the northwestern Mediterranean Sea were chosen as the main subject areas {{for the study of}} some of the key processes operating in water and in sediment: chemical scavenging, particle transport, sediment resuspension and deposition. The dynamic behaviour of the radioactive tracers, 21 OPb, 210 po and 137 Cs, was examined in the study areas to identify mechanisms and time scales of those key processes, in order to predict the fate and impact of the particle-reactive chemical pollutants in the coastal and shelf systems of the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Determination of sediment accumulation and mixing based on the 210 Pb and 137 Cs profiles gave an estimate of annual deposition flux (0. 12 g/cm 2 /yr) in the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Ground,</b> an organic-rich fine grained deposition area in the southern North Sea. A similar study was also carried out in the Gulf of Lions area (northwestern Mediterranean Sea), which showed that the intensive sediment reworking is restricted to the uppermost sediment column and most of the sediment supplied by the Rhone river is deposited close to the river mouth with only a small amount being transported towards the nearby deep basin of the Mediterranean Sea. The spatial distribution of 210 Pb and 137 Cs and the mixing rates of the bottom sediment in the southern North Sea were studied. Profiles of the two radioactive nuclides show intensive sediment mixing and subsurface maxima of 210 Pb in most sediment cores down to 40 cm depth in the sediments. Diffusion model calculations revealed that sediment mixing in this area could not be described by diffusive processes. Applying a single event subsurface egestion model gave good agreement between model curves and measured profiles. It is concluded that the subsurface maxima of excess 210 Pb are related to the non-diffusive biogenic mixing and that this kind of mixing {{plays an important role in}} determining the fate of the sediment in the coastal and shelf environments of the study area. A study of the disequilibrium and distribution of 210 Pb and 21 Opo showed the importance of scavenging processes in the southern North Sea. The observed low concentrations of total 210 Pb in the study area were related to a high concentration of suspended matter, high resuspension rates and low atmospheric input. An excess of 21 OPo, both in dissolved and particulate form, indicated an additional flux of 210 Po from the coastal and shelf sediments because of high resuspension rates. Mass balance calculations from a box model revealed a shorter residence time and higher uptake rate for dissolved 210 Po than for dissolved 210 pb, which indicates a high recycling efficiency. Comparison of data on the 210 Pb concentrations in water and sediment showed that a regular excess of 210 po as observed in the water column is balanced by a small deficit of 210 Po in the sediments. Special attention was also given to possible seasonal influces on distributions of 210 Pb and 210 po in the water column of the Dutch coastal zone. Measurements of water samples revealed that the concentrations of dissolved 210 Pb and 21 Opo were low during the summer, whereas the particulate 210 Pb and 21 Opo were relatively high during the spring and winter. The observed seasonal variation in the distribution of the two radionuclides was considered to be the result of high effective scavenging in summer and enhanced resuspension in winter. A onedimensional seasonal model was developed to account for the observed seasonal variation. The derived time-variation of the total 210 Pb and 21 OPo is in close agreement with the field data. It is concluded that 210 Pb deposition from the atmosphere at the sea surface plays a key role in controlling the distribution of 210 Pb and 21 Opo in the study area, but is not sufficient to account for all 210 Pb and 21 Opo that is present.

50|$|Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) - Once widely found {{through much}} of the harbor and a staple of the local diet {{from the time of the}} Algonquians up through the 19th century. <b>Oystering</b> <b>grounds</b> were {{prevalent}} in the Upper Bay, as well as along the south shore of Staten Island and Jamaica Bay. The oyster still exists in the harbor but is not yet considered edible; there are plans to further clean up the areas so that the beds can be restored.|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} Louisiana faces a coastal crisis that affects {{not only the}} local communities, but also the {{ecosystem}} and its inhabitants. Anthropogenic influences over the decades have forever altered {{the course of the}} Mississippi River and the structure of the delta that greatly correlates to the growth and erosion of the Gulf of Mexico coastline. This region is home {{to one of the most}} productive <b>oyster</b> <b>grounds</b> in the United States and the construction of levees and diversions has reduced the habitat available for these organisms. Strategies proposed by plans like the 2012 Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast implements the use of sediment diversions to rebuild land on the coast. However, this could have an impact on oysters, but few studies analyze the pros and cons diversions may have on them. To gain a better understanding on the topic, past and current literature is reviewed and summarized. Research suggests that the use of diversions will cause <b>oyster</b> <b>grounds</b> and its farmers to migrate with little influence to the production levels. Both policy makers and scientists continue to argue about the methods and actions needed to mediate the problem. If investments are not made in the act of restoration then a greater price will be paid in the future...|$|R

50|$|The Oyster Act of 1886 was {{introduced}} to encourage sustainable oyster culture (the cultivation of oysters and the taking of oysters for sale). The Act offered transferable, 14 year leases over identified <b>oyster</b> <b>grounds</b> which could comprise both an oyster dredge section and oyster banks. Licenses were still available for working oyster banks not within a dredge section. A penalty for selling undersized oysters {{was introduced}}, and lessees and licensees were required to register a brand, which had to appear on all oyster bags. Importantly, lessees had to reserve some cultivation on each bank, and to constantly renew the oyster stock.|$|R
50|$|The {{shores of}} the bay are largely {{composed}} of salt marshes and mudflats, with only small communities inhabiting {{the shore of the}} lower bay. Besides the Delaware, it is fed by numerous smaller rivers and streams, including (from north to south) the Christina River, Appoquinimink River, Leipsic River, Smyrna River, St. Jones River, and Murderkill Rivers on the Delaware side, and the Salem River, Cohansey River, and Maurice Rivers on the New Jersey side. Several of the rivers hold protected status for their unique salt marsh wetlands bordering the bay, which serves as a breeding ground for many aquatic species, including horseshoe crabs. The bay is also a prime <b>oystering</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R

40|$|The trophodynamics of pelagic and benthic {{animals of}} the North Sea, North Atlantic shelf, were {{assessed}} using stable isotope analysis (SIA) of natural abundance carbon and nitrogen isotopes, lipid fingerprinting and compound-specific SIA (CSIA) of phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFAs). Zooplankton (z), epi- and supra-benthic macrofauna {{were collected in}} the Southern Bight, at the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Grounds</b> and at North Dogger, 111 km north of the Dogger Bank. The study included 22 taxonomic groups with particular reference to Mollusca (Bivalvia and Gastropoda) and Crustacea. Primary consumers (Bivalvia) were overall most 15 N enriched in the southern North Sea (6. 1 ‰) and more depleted in the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Grounds</b> (5. 5 ‰) and at North Dogger (2. 8 ‰) demonstrating differences in isotopic baselines for bivalve fauna between the study sites. Higher trophic levels also followed this trend. Over an annual cycle, consumers tended to exhibit 15 N depletion during spring followed by 15 N enriched signatures in autumn and winter. The observed seasonal changes of δ 15 N were more pronounced for suspension feeders and deposit feeders (dfs) than for filter feeders (ffs). The position of animals in plots of δ 13 C and δ 15 N largely concurred with the expected position according to literature-based functional feeding groups. PLFA fingerprints of groups such as z were distinct from benthic groups, e. g. benthic ffs and dfs, and predatory macrobenthos. δ 13 C PLFA signatures indicated similarities in 13 C moiety sources that constituted δ 13 C PLFA. Although functional groups of pelagic zooplankton and (supra-) benthic animals represented phylogenetically distinct consumer groups, δ 13 C PLFA demonstrated that both groups were supported by pelagic primary production and relied on the same macronutrients such as PLFAs. Errors related to the static categorization of small invertebrates into fixed trophic positions defined by phylogenetic groupings rather than by functional feeding groups, and information on seasonal trophodynamic variability, may have implications for the reliability of numerical marine ecosystem models...|$|R
40|$|State and Federal policymakers are {{considering}} options {{to increase the}} harvest of native oysters (Crassostrea virginica) from the Chesapeake Bay and nearby coastal waters. This study investigates two policy options: reforming the current leasing system and {{increasing the amount of}} funding allocated to research and development. Analysis is based on a survey of oyster producers and an oyster bioeconomic simulation model. Results show that shellfish research aimed at increasing growth rates, reducing mortality, and reducing seed costs could significantly increase returns to oyster aquaculture. Reforming the current leasing system to expand the availability of <b>oyster</b> <b>grounds</b> would do little to increase oyster production because few growers view the current leasing system as a significant barrier to expanding their operations. Further research is needed to investigate other types of assistance to enhance oyster aquaculture and to estimate the producer response to possible price effects of expanding oyster output...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the potential causes of low oxygen levels in the bottom water of the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Grounds</b> region of the shallow southern North Sea, an area which provides suitable conditions for low oxygen levels to develop. At {{the end of the summer}} stratified period, relevant biogeochemical processes were investigated using a combination of sedimentary and water column rate measurements. Phytoplankton nitrate and ammonium uptake was measured throughout the water column using 15 N labelled isotopes and showed ammonium uptake dominated in the upper and bottom mixed layer with a maximum 294. 4 µmol N m- 3 h- 1. In the deep chlorophyll maximum at the thermocline, primary production was dominated by nitrate uptake, with an average of 35. 0 µmol N m- 3 h- 1, relative to ammonium uptake, with an average of 24. 6 µmol N m- 3 h- 1. This high relative nitrate uptake will in part result in exportable new production to the isolated bottom mixed layer and sediments, as opposed to regenerated ammonium driven uptake. This biomass export was indicated by significant benthic oxygen consumption rates in the stratified region (782 - 1275 µmol O 2 m- 2 h- 1 µmol N m- 3 h- 1) long after the end of the spring bloom. The sediments were also an active net source of nitrate, ammonium, phosphate and silicate into the bottom mixed layer of 4. 4, 8. 4, 2. 3 and 68. 8 µmol m- 2 h- 1, respectively. The export of new production within the thermocline to the bottom mixed layer and the consequent sediment oxygen consumption in the isolated bottom mixed layer in the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Grounds</b> are expected to have contributed to the low bottom water oxygen concentrations of 2. 07 mg l- 1 (64. 7 µmol l- 1) measured. The long stratified period associated with this low oxygen is predicted to occur more regularly in the future and continued monitoring of this ecologically important region is therefore essential if the causes of these potentially damaging low oxygen levels are to be fully understood...|$|R

40|$|A {{model for}} bivalve growth was {{developed}} {{and the results were}} tested against field observations. The model is based on the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory and includes an extension of the standard DEB model to cope with changing food quantity and quality. At 4 different locations in the North Sea (Wadden Sea, Sean Gas Field, <b>Oyster</b> <b>Grounds</b> and Dogger Bank), labelled blue mussels Mytilus edulis were kept under natural conditions. Shell length was repeatedly measured for each mussel during the experiment, and dry weight was determined {{at the end of the}} experiment for some of the mussels. Temperature, salinity, chlorophyll concentration and Secchi depth (at the Wadden Sea location) were measured next to the experimental sites. Model performance was evaluated by comparing predicted and measured shell length, dry weight and growth at each location for each individual, without changing parameter values that were previously obtained from independent studies. The results show that the model was able to reproduce the main patterns of the observations, implying that the main metabolic processes at the individual level are well described. © Inter-Research 2012 · www. int-res. com...|$|R
40|$|Prompted {{by recent}} {{observations}} of seasonal low dissolved oxygen from two moorings in the North Sea, a hydrographic survey in August 2010 mapped the spatial extent of summer oxygen depletion. Typical near-bed dissolved oxygen saturations in the stratified {{regions of the}} North Sea were 75 – 80 % while the well-mixed regions of the southern North Sea reached 90 %. Two regions of strong thermal stratification, the area between the Dooley and Central North Sea Currents and the area known as the <b>Oyster</b> <b>Grounds,</b> had oxygen saturations as low as 65 and 70 % (200 and 180 µmol dm- 3) respectively. Low dissolved oxygen was apparent in regions characterised by low advection, high stratification, elevated organic matter production from the spring bloom and a deep chlorophyll maximum. Historical data {{over the last century}} from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea oceanographic database highlight an increase in seasonal oxygen depletion and a warming over the past 20 years. The 2010 survey is consistent with, and reinforces, the signal of recent depleted oxygen at key locations seen in the (albeit sparse) historical data...|$|R
