40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the structural relationships among teaching presence, cognitive presence, usage, learning flow, satisfaction, and learning persistence in corporate e-learners. The research participants were 462 e-learners registered for cyber-lectures through an electronics company in South Korea. The extrinsic variables were sense <b>of</b> teaching <b>presence,</b> sense <b>of</b> cognitive <b>presence,</b> and usage. According to structural equation modeling, each of these variables and flow significantly affected satisfaction. Although sense <b>of</b> teaching <b>presence</b> and satisfaction significantly affected sense <b>of</b> cognitive <b>presence,</b> usage and flow did not significantly affect learning persistence. Accordingly, we established a corrected model after removing insignificant paths and investigated again. We confirmed that learning flow significantly intermediated among sense <b>of</b> teaching <b>presence,</b> sense <b>of</b> cognitive <b>presence,</b> and satisfaction but not between usage and satisfaction. In addition, satisfaction intermediated among sense <b>of</b> teaching <b>presence,</b> sense <b>of</b> cognitive <b>presence,</b> usage, flow, and learning persistence. These findings demonstrate the importance of sense <b>of</b> teaching <b>presence,</b> sense <b>of</b> cognitive <b>presence,</b> and usage for e-learners. We expect that the results {{will contribute to the}} formation and improvement of fundamental learning strategies for successful e-learning...|$|R
