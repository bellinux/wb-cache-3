We examined the transient consequences of reserve establishment for fished metapopulations, considering both a well-mixed larval pool and a spatially explicit model based on a coral trout (Plectropomus spp.) metapopulation. When fishing pressure was reallocated relative to the area protected, yields decreased initially, then recovered, and ultimately exceeded pre-reserve levels. However, recovery time was on the order of several years to decades. If fishing pressure intensified to maintain pre-reserve yields, reserves were sometimes unable to support the increased mortality and the metapopulation collapsed. This was more likely when reserves were small, or located peripherally within the metapopulation. <b>Overall,</b> <b>reserves</b> can achieve positive conservation and fishery benefits, but fisheries management complementary to reserve implementation is essential...|$|R
40|$|Main {{goals of}} this master thesis are following: {{to perform the}} state of the art {{research}} of overpressure constructions (especially space habitats, plane fuselages); to create an own concept of the functional inside ending (hole) in the sandwich panel for a door; to perform stress-strain analysis of this concept; to perform the design optimalization of this concept in order to minimise the weight. To solve the problems above software Ansys 17. 2 is chosen, because it allows to: model the material of the honeycomb core of sandwich panel as homogenous linear orthotropic material; evaluate reserve factors of all critical limit states; perform the design optimalization; perform Monte Carlo simulation. First and second design optimalizations discover, that with defined parameters: 0, 635 mm width of aluminium sandwich face sheets and inner overpressure 0, 1 MPa, a creation of the model, that would be safe by changing the values of design variables is not possible. Specifically, the maximum value of shear stress on the glued areas between aluminium face sheets and honeycomb core is higher than the shear strength of the glue. Therefore, two new concepts are created. First for inner pressure 0, 03 MPa and bigger width of aluminium face sheets 3, 175 mm, second for inner pressure 0, 02 MPa and same width of aluminium face sheets 0, 635 mm. For both these concepts, an <b>overall</b> <b>reserve</b> factor is calculated. First, the value of an <b>overall</b> <b>reserve</b> factor is calculated deterministically. Secondly, the value of an <b>overall</b> <b>reserve</b> factor is calculated stochastically considering the variance of material properties of the honeycomb core ± 10 % by Monte Carlo simulation. An <b>overall</b> <b>reserve</b> factor of the concept with inner pressure 0, 02 MPa is determined as 1, 21. An <b>overall</b> <b>reserve</b> factor of the concept with inner pressure 0, 03 MPa is determined as 1, 20. The weight of the concept for inner pressure 0, 03 MPa is though 4 times bigger than the weight of the concept for inner pressure 0, 02 MPa. In the concept for inner pressure 0, 02 MPa the maximum value of HMH stress in aluminium components is critical, stochastically considered material properties of the honeycomb core don’t have a significant influence on this value. In the concept for inner pressure 0, 03 MPa the value of maximum shear stress on the glued areas between aluminium face sheets and the honeycomb core is critical, stochastically considered material properties of the honeycomb core have a significant influence on this value. In the concept for inner pressure 0, 03 MPa an absolute error of <b>overall</b> <b>reserve</b> factor is 8 % (<b>overall</b> <b>reserve</b> factor calculated deterministically was 1, 28) which is significant. Monte Carlo simulation is also used to find that the value of Poisson ratio XY of the honeycomb core doesn’t have statistically significant influence on all limit states. Value of the reserve factor of the honeycomb core is higher than 2 in both concepts. Monte Carlo simulation discovers that this value can be significantly lower. Using Tsai-Wu failure criteria the reserve factor in the concept for inner pressure 0, 02 MPa is determined as 2, 72 deterministically x 2, 41 stochastically (absolute error 31 %), in the concept for inner pressure 0, 03 MPa the reserve factor is determined as 6, 85 deterministically x 6, 17 stochastically (absolute error 68 %) ...|$|E

It employs an error-in-variables approach used in rationalexpectations-macro-econometrics to set up a structural model that links sovereign loan spreads to realized repayment behavior. Unlike the existing empirical literature, its instrumental variables method allows for distinguishing a direct influence of past repayment problems (a “pure reputation ” effect) from one that goes through increased default probabilities. Using developing country data from the period 1973 - 1981 and constructing continuous variables for credit history, we find that past default is a significant determinant of the spread, even after including country fixed effects. Moreover, its reduced-form effect is very similar to its structural form effect, indicating that most of the influence of past repayment problems is through the reputation channel. <b>Overall,</b> <b>reserves</b> to imports, past and predicted future default are substantial determinants of sovereign bank loan spreads...|$|R

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of outstanding claims uncertainty plays {{a fundamental role in}} managing insurance companies; reserve risk is indeed {{an essential part}} of underwriting risks. In literature, stochastic methodologies for valuation of future loss payments have been built up with the aim to assess, as far as possible, the capital requirement for reserve risk, through the estimation of the probability distribution of risks involved. To this end, the International Actuarial Association (IAA) (see [13]) provided a method based on a paper of Meyers et al. [17] in which the <b>overall</b> <b>reserve</b> of a single LoB (without any distinction among different accident years) follows a compound mixed Poisson process, as used in premium risk to estimate aggregate loss distribution (see [1], [2], [12] and [19]). Some extensions are given in [20] and [21] where claims reserve is obtained assuming that each incremental payment is described by a compound mixed Poisson process. Exact mean and variance of the reserve distribution are also provided. We extend here previous approaches. We propose to describe each cell of the lower run-off triangle as a compound mixed Poisson process in which a structure variable is directly applied to the claim size. In this way, we catch parameter uncertainty on both frequency and severity distributions. Through this approach, we also take into account the dependency between payments of different development or accident years. Exact values of mean, variance and skewness of the reserve distribution are proved. Furthermore, Monte Carlo method allows to simulate the outstanding claims distribution for the <b>overall</b> <b>reserve</b> until complete run-off and the next calendar year only, in case of a one-year time horizon is required (e. g. for Solvency II purposes). Model’s parameters are calibrated by observed data and through the Frequency- Severity deterministic method which provides a separate estimation of number of claims and average costs.

40|$|Stochastic {{models for}} {{outstanding}} claims valuation have been recently developed {{with the aim}} to obtain either a variability coefficient or the probability distribution of the reserve, useful {{for the assessment of}} the Reserve Risk capital requirement. Different methodologies, like Bootstrapping or Bayesian methods, allow to determine the prediction error and the claims reserve distribution under some assumptions based on the data figured out in the run-off triangle. The International Actuarial Association (IAA) proposed a different way to analyse out-standing claim reserve, focused on a paper by Meyers, Klinker and Lalonde where the <b>overall</b> <b>reserve</b> of a single LoB (without any distinction among different accident years) is described as a compound mixed poisson process, by a similar approach used for aggregate amount of claims when premium risk is to be estimated. In the present paper we extend this approach assuming that each single cell of {{the lower part of the}} run-off triangle follows a Compound Poisson Process (either Pure or Mixed). This assumption leads, under independence constraint, to obtain quite easily the exact moments of the reserve distribution only through the knowledge of the characteristics of the two main random variables (number and claim size of future payments). Furthermore, Monte Carlo methods allow to simulate outstanding claims distributions for each accident year, for both the <b>overall</b> <b>reserve</b> until complete run-off and the next calendar year only (in case of a one-year time horizon as prescribed in Solvency II). Model s parameters are calibrated from observed data and through a deterministic model (in the present paper an average cost method is used, namely Fisher-Lange method) based on the separate estimate of number of claims to be paid and future average costs for each cell of the lower triangle to be estimated. Finally, we analyze the one-year reserve risk in the perspective adopted by Solvency II. In particular a simulation approach, now usually called re-reserving, is here applied with the target to estimate the variability of claims development result and the percentiles, in order to quantify the capital requirement for the reserve risk. Main results will be compared using different stochastic reserving models, analysing the effect on both capital requirement for only reserve risk and risk margin...|$|E
