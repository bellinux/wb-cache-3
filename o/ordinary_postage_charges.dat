50|$|From 1880 <b>ordinary</b> penny <b>postage</b> stamps {{were used}} to save up one {{shilling}} (12 pence) which was then sufficient to open a Post Office Savings Bank account, although the minimum amount required changed to £1 in 1912.

25|$|During {{the first}} half year of its {{inception}} the Parcel Post service with its new series of special stamps proved to be very successful, resulting with the mailing of more than 300 million parcels during this short period. But after much confusion among and pressure from postal workers, the Post Office Department acquiesced and the Postmaster General authorized the use of <b>ordinary</b> <b>postage</b> stamps to pay the postage on 4th class parcels, beginning on July 1, 1913, ending mandatory use of the new stamps after precisely six months. In turn Parcel Post stamps were allowed for use to pay the postage for all classes of mail until the supply finally ran out. This is the only series of stamps issued by the Post Office that have ever been allowed dual usage. The last printing of Parcel Post stamps, a run of the 10-cent value, occurred on June 24, 1913, but stamps still in stock continued to be shipped to post offices for quite some time, particularly of higher values, with the final delivery—a supply of 75-cent stamps—made as late as 1921. Although the stamps were discontinued, one new denomination of the series—20 cents—was deemed too useful to discard, and a 20 cent value was accordingly added to the existing definitive Washington-Franklin series.|$|R

40|$|Postal {{services}} have emerged and existed {{because of the}} need for communication and their millenary existence was achieved due to three elements: the only channel of communication, the state of monopoly conferred by the status of the state institution and therefore no competition. The most important known moments in the history of postal services, which led to reforms are: unification of <b>postage</b> <b>charges,</b> postal stamp appearance and now, liberalization of postal services. The slow development of the postal sector varies from country to country, depending on the state of development of the country and within countries depending on the gap between urban and rural areas. The operation of postal services throughout their existence was and is provided by specific legislation and it should be aligned with international postal legislation, to ensure continuity of information. There can be no country to formulate its own laws or its own organization, without regard to organization and international regulations. Both the specificity and diversity of postal services causes a special approach {{in the context of their}} market and also in the services market context. Postal services are services of general interest, which emerged from communication need, from personal or official needs, not from economic needs. As an alternative to postal {{services have}} emerged and developed rapidly the courier services that come to complete and even compete to this category of services. We proposed in this paper to analyze and compare these two categories of services to determine the advantages and disadvantages but also the degree of which grow together or develop in a continuous competition...|$|R
