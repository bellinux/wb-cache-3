5|$|After {{several months}} he spent as an {{experimental}} case, military authorities began {{to press for}} Tarrare {{to be returned to}} active duty. Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating habits and digestive system, and approached General Alexandre deBeauharnais with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use. A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was retrieved from his excrement, with the document still in legible condition. Courville proposed to deBeauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>being</b> found if he were searched.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that dinosaurs were {{the ancestors of}} birds was first suggested in 1868 by Thomas Henry Huxley. After the work of Gerhard Heilmann in the early 20th century, the theory of birds as dinosaur descendants was abandoned {{in favor of the}} idea <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>being</b> descendants of generalized thecodonts, with the key piece of evidence being the supposed lack of clavicles in dinosaurs. However, as later discoveries showed, clavicles (or a single fused wishbone, which derived from separate clavicles) were not actually absent; they had been found as early as 1924 in Oviraptor, but misidentified as an interclavicle. In the 1970s, John Ostrom revived the dinosaur–bird theory, which gained momentum in the coming decades with the advent of cladistic analysis, and a great increase in the discovery of small theropods and early birds. Of particular note have been the fossils of the Yixian Formation, where a variety of theropods and early birds have been found, often with feathers of some type. Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs, which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives.|$|E
5|$|The sixth William {{was briefly}} succeeded {{by his son}} Peter, who was {{followed}} by his son William. William the seventh's son was the eighth William Davenport, and an inventory of his property made shortly {{after his death in}} 1706 shows the gallery and gatehouse of Bramall were still intact. His two eldest sons each inherited the estate but both died young and heirless, so the estate passed to their younger brother Warren Davenport. Warren became part of the clergy, and during his tenure at Bramall set up a school close to the entrance of the estate. The tenth and final William Davenport succeeded his father, Warren at the age of four. Many changes were made to the house during his tenure, including the dismantling of the gatehouse side of the courtyard and the long gallery, the latter of which may have been done because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>being</b> considered unsafe. William had no sons, so the estate passed to Salusbury Pryce Humphreys, the husband of his illegitimate daughter Maria.|$|E

5|$|Various {{forms of}} divine command theory have been {{presented}} by philosophers including William of Ockham, St Augustine, Duns Scotus, and John Calvin. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of God and that morality is determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's command is {{the only reason that}} a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason. The theory asserts that good actions are morally good as a result <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>being</b> commanded by God, and many religious believers subscribe to some form of divine command theory. Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what is morally right is what God desires.|$|E
5|$|Various {{studies of}} the tower took place from the late 18th century onwards. The {{antiquarian}} Francis Grose noted in 1783 that the tower was then called the Old Jail, recording a local tradition that the abbey had used the basement as a dungeon, and the upper storeys as a prison for lesser offences. During this period, the tower was used for drying and stowing hops, probably in advance <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>being</b> taken to local kilns. The artist J. M. W. Turner visited and sketched the tower around 1791. A group of French antiquarians visited in 1840, and commented on the considerable age of the building. Around 1863, {{a hole in the}} west wall, left by the attempted destruction of the stair turret, was filled with a new entrance way.|$|E

25|$|To {{dispose of}} the body, the {{suitcases}} were thrown off a bridge over the Lehigh River in White Haven, Pennsylvania, along Interstate 80.

25|$|The {{differences}} Partners Spades and Cutthroat bidding {{and play}} are substantial. In Partners, a player would bid a trick for every Ace, King, and Queen {{in a side}} suit (i.e.: non-Spade). In Cutthroat, a player would rarely bid on a King in a long side suit (5+ cards) nor a Queen in any length side suit {{because of the risk}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>being</b> trumped. This risk is reduced in Partners by the possibility that partner may be out of the long suit and able to discard or to overtrump an opponent.|$|E

However, suspicions on the veracity of doorjamb fingerprints found at the Brown crime scene have arisen, including charges that the police planted the fingerprint since it allegedly looks like a rolled fingerprint, the type that you would find on a police fingerprint index card. Both sets of prints have come under serious question as to their validity, good faith collection and possible contamination; even the possibility <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>being</b> planted.|$|E
25|$|Over a long time, Jews formed {{distinct}} {{ethnic groups}} in several different geographic areas—amongst others, the Ashkenazi Jews (of central and Eastern Europe), the Sephardi Jews (of Spain, Portugal, and North Africa), the Beta Israel of Ethiopia, and the Yemenite Jews from {{the southern tip of}} the Arabian Peninsula. Many of these groups have developed differences in their prayers, traditions and accepted canons; however, these distinctions are mainly the result <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>being</b> formed at some cultural distance from normative (rabbinic) Judaism, rather than based on any doctrinal dispute.|$|E
25|$|The key spiritual {{figures in}} the {{religion}} were the Nummo/Nommo twins. According to Ogotemmêli's description of them, the Nummo, whom he {{also referred to as}} the Serpent, were amphibians that were often compared to serpents, lizards, chameleons, and occasionally even sloths (because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>being</b> slow moving and having a shapeless neck). They were also described as fish capable of walking on land; while they were on land, the Nummo stood upright on their tails. The Nummos' skin was primarily green, but, like the chameleon, it sometimes changed colours. It was said to at times have all the colours of the rainbow.|$|E
