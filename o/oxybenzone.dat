50|$|<b>Oxybenzone</b> or benzophenone-3 (trade names Milestab 9, Eusolex 4360, Escalol 567, KAHSCREEN BZ-3) is {{an organic}} compound. It is a pale-yellow solid that is readily soluble in most organic solvents. <b>Oxybenzone</b> {{belongs to the}} class of {{aromatic}} ketones known as benzophenones. It is a component of many sunscreen lotions.|$|E
50|$|When applied topically UV filters, such as <b>oxybenzone,</b> are absorbed {{through the}} skin, metabolized, and {{excreted}} primarily through the urine. The method of biotransformation, {{the process by}} which a foreign compound is chemically transformed to form a metabolite, was determined by Okereke and colleagues through oral and dermal administration of <b>oxybenzone</b> to rats. The scientists analyzed blood, urine, feces, and tissue samples and found three metabolites: 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone(DHB), 2,2-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (DHMB) and 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzophenone (THB). To form DHB the methoxy functional group undergoes o-dealkylation; to form THB the same ring is hydroxylated. Ring B in <b>oxybenzone</b> is hydroxylated to form DHMB.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxybenzone</b> is {{produced}} by Friedel-Crafts reaction of benzoyl chloride with 3-methoxyphenol(3-hydroxyanisole).|$|E

50|$|<b>Oxybenzone</b> {{is used in}} {{plastics}} as an {{ultraviolet light}} absorber and stabilizer. It is used, along with other benzophenones, in sunscreens, hair sprays, and cosmetics because they help prevent potential damage from sunlight exposure. It is also found, in concentrations up to 1%, in nail polishes. <b>Oxybenzone</b> {{can also be used}} as a photostabilizer for synthetic resins. Benzophenones can leach from food packaging, and are widely used as photo-initiators to activate a chemical that dries ink faster.|$|E
50|$|Revised as of 2007, the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS)) Cosmetic Guidelines allow <b>oxybenzone</b> for {{cosmetic}} use up to 10%.|$|E

50|$|Being a {{conjugated}} molecule, <b>oxybenzone</b> absorbs {{at lower}} energies than many aromatic molecules. As in related compounds, the hydroxyl group is hydrogen bonded to the ketone. This interaction contributes to oxybenzone's light-absorption properties. At low temperatures, however, {{it is possible}} to observe both the phosphorescence and the triplet-triplet absorption spectrum. At 175 K the triplet lifetime is 24 ns. The short lifetime has been attributed to a fast intramolecular hydrogen transfer between the oxygen of the C=O and the OH.|$|E
50|$|As a sunscreen, it {{provides}} broad-spectrum ultraviolet coverage, including UVB and short-wave UVA rays. As a photoprotective agent, {{it has an}} absorption profile spanning from 270 to 350 nm with absorption peaks at 288 and 350 nm. It {{is one of the}} most widely used organic UVA filters in sunscreens today. It is also found in nail polish, fragrances, hairspray, and cosmetics as a photostabilizer. Despite its photoprotective qualities, much controversy surrounds <b>oxybenzone</b> because of its possible hormonal and photoallergenic effects, leading many countries to regulate its use.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, EWG updated Skin Deep with {{a report}} on {{chemicals}} in sunscreen, lip balm and SPF lotions. The report states that 3 out of 5 sunscreen products offer inadequate protection from the sun, or contain ingredients with significant safety concerns. The report identifies only 17% of the {{products on the market}} as both safe and effective, blocking both UVA and UVB radiation, remaining stable in sunlight, and containing few if any ingredients with significant known or suspected health hazards. <b>Oxybenzone</b> is among the list that blocks both forms of radiation but has been deemed unsafe by the EWG due to controversy over its potential estrogenic and anti-androgenic effects.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to formulate <b>oxybenzone</b> into nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) to enhance its sunscreening efficacy and safety. NLCs of <b>oxybenzone</b> were prepared by the solvent diffusion method. A complete 23 factorial design was used for the evaluation of the prepared <b>oxybenzone</b> NLCs. The study design involves the investigation of the effect of three independent variables namely liquid lipid type (Miglyol 812 and oleic acid), liquid lipid concentration (15 % and 30 %), and <b>oxybenzone</b> concentration (5 % and 10 % with respect to total lipids) on the particle size (p. s.), the entrapment efficiency (EE%) and the in vitro drug release after 8  h. The prepared NLCs were spherical in overall shape and were below 0. 8  μm. Miglyol 812 and 30 % liquid lipid were found to significantly decrease the p. s. and increase the EE% when compared to oleic acid and 15 % liquid lipid. Increasing <b>oxybenzone</b> concentration increased significantly the p. s. but did not affect the EE%. NLCs prepared using Miglyol 812, 15 % liquid lipid, and 10 % <b>oxybenzone</b> showed slower drug release when compared to those prepared using oleic acid, 30 % liquid lipid, and 5 % <b>oxybenzone,</b> respectively. The candidate oxybenzone-loaded NLC dispersion was then formulated into gel. The incorporation of <b>oxybenzone</b> into NLCs greatly increased the in vitro sun protection factor and erythemal UVA protection factor of <b>oxybenzone</b> more than six- and eightfold, respectively, while providing the advantage of overcoming side effects of free <b>oxybenzone</b> as evidenced by very low irritation potential...|$|E
40|$|We used noninvasive Fourier {{transform}} (FT) Raman spectroscopy {{to follow}} {{the fate of the}} broadly used ultraviolet UVA sun blocker, <b>oxybenzone,</b> after topical application to the skin. Our results showed that <b>oxybenzone</b> is rapidly photo-oxidized, yielding <b>oxybenzone</b> semiquinone, a potent electrophile, which reacts with thiol groups on important anti-oxidant enzymes and substrates, such as thioredoxin reductase and reduced glutathione, respectively. Although <b>oxybenzone</b> is an excellent broad spectrum UVA filter, its rapid oxidation followed by the inactivation of important antioxidant systems indicates that this substance may be rather harmful to the homeostasis of the epidermis. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that ET-Raman spectroscopy is a useful method for studying the transport and metabolism of active ingredients in topical preparations...|$|E
