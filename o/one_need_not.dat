25|$|To say the least, a {{fight at}} close range is {{absorbing}} as a spectacle. No man wants to take his eyes from it until that time comes when he makes up his mind to run away. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle is in itself hard work. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle and hear immediate evidences of the boundless enthusiasm with which a large company of the enemy shoot at you from an adjacent thicket is, to my mind at least, a very great feat. <b>One</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> dwell upon the detail of keeping the mind carefully upon a slow spelling of an important code message.|$|E
25|$|Research into paraconsistent logic {{has also}} led to the {{establishment}} of the philosophical school of dialetheism (most notably advocated by Graham Priest), which asserts that true contradictions exist in reality, for example groups of people holding opposing views on various moral issues. Being a dialetheist rationally commits one to some form of paraconsistent logic, on pain of otherwise embracing trivialism, i.e. accepting that all contradictions (and equivalently all statements) are true. However, the study of paraconsistent logics does not necessarily entail a dialetheist viewpoint. For example, <b>one</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> commit to either the existence of true theories or true contradictions, but would rather prefer a weaker standard like empirical adequacy, as proposed by Bas van Fraassen.|$|E

500|$|Because {{the method}} of {{radicals}} is applied only to the written character, <b>one</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> know how to pronounce a character before looking it up; the entry, once located, usually gives the pronunciation. [...] However, {{it is not always}} easy to identify which of the various roots of a character is the proper radical. [...] Accordingly, dictionaries often include a list of hard to locate characters, indexed by total stroke count, near the beginning of the dictionary. [...] Some dictionaries include almost one-seventh of all characters in this list.|$|E
500|$|The {{first point}} follows from basic {{properties}} of the real numbers: L has a supremum and R has an infimum, which are easily seen to be equal; being a real number it either lies in R or in L, but not both since L and R {{are supposed to be}} disjoint. The second point generalizes the 0.999.../1.000... pair obtained for p1="0", p2="1". In fact <b>one</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> use the same alphabet for all positions (so that for instance mixed radix systems can be included) or consider the full collection of possible strings; the only important points are that at each position a finite set of symbols (which may even depend on the previous symbols) can be chosen from (this is needed to ensure maximal and minimal choices), and that making a valid choice for any position should result in a valid infinite string (so one should not allow [...] "9" [...] in each position while forbidding an infinite succession of [...] "9"s). Under these assumptions, the above argument shows that an order preserving map from the collection of strings to an interval of the real numbers cannot be a bijection: either some numbers do not correspond to any string, or some of them correspond to more than one string.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was during}} this time that Wittgenstein began {{addressing}} what he {{considered to be a}} central issue in Notes on Logic, a general decision procedure for determining the truth value of logical propositions which would stem from a single primitive proposition. He became convinced during this time that “ll the propositions of logic are generalizations of tautologies and all generalizations of tautologies are generalizations of logic. There are no other logical propositions.” [...] Based on this, Wittgenstein argued that propositions of logic express their truth or falsehood in the sign itself, and <b>one</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> know anything about the constituent parts of the proposition to determine it true or false.

2500|$|Hayek’s {{concept of}} the market as a {{spontaneous}} order has been recently applied to ecosystems to defend a broadly non-interventionist policy. Like the market, ecosystems contain complex networks of information, involve an ongoing dynamic process, contain orders within orders, and the entire system operates without being directed by a conscious mind. On this analysis, species {{takes the place of}} price as a visible element of the system formed by a complex set of largely unknowable elements. [...] Human ignorance about the countless interactions between the organisms of an ecosystem limits our ability to manipulate nature. [...] Since humans rely on the ecosystem to sustain themselves, we have a prima facie obligation to not disrupt such systems. [...] This analysis of ecosystems as spontaneous orders does not rely on markets qualifying as spontaneous orders.
