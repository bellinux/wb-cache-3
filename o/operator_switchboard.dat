40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA queuing system is investigated {{in which two}} types of customers, Type 1 and Type 2, attempt to access a multiserver <b>operator</b> <b>switchboard.</b> Customer arrivals for each type {{are assumed to be}} in accordance with independent Poisson processes with time constant parameters. Service times are assumed to be exponentially distributed and each type of customer has a different service rate. When a queue is formed, Type 1 customers are allowed to queue regardless of the length of the queue but Type 2 customers are blocked when the queue size exceeds a predesignated limit. An exact solution of the problem was not obtained and a discussion of the complications which precluded an exact solution is presented. A simulation algorithm is developed and validated by comparison with an exact solution of the special case of the problem in which the service rates are equal. Finally, an analytical approximation is developed and shown to give reasonable results by comparison with the simulation model. [URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|E

50|$|The rise of {{telemarketing}} can {{be traced}} back to the 19th century telephonists, or <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators.</b> Trans-cultural hiring of <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators</b> (mostly women) became especially popular in North America throughout the 20th century, partially due to popularity gained through advertising. After the shift from public switched telephone network to computer-based electronic switching system, the job of <b>switchboard</b> <b>operators</b> gradually diminished. However, with the rise of advertising and with the popularity of the telephone use, new jobs, including telemarketing jobs, were created.|$|R

50|$|During {{the first}} part of the 20th century, Pacific Telephone & Telegraph, along with the rest of the Bell System, {{initially}} resisted automating its services, on the premise that their people could provide better service than machines. When it acquired competing providers, if the company provided automatic dial service, Bell removed the automatic equipment and replaced it with manual telephones and manual <b>operator</b> <b>switchboards.</b> However the company soon realized its best manual systems were unable to keep up with the growing demand for telephone service. In the early 1920s, following the 1921 installation of the nation's first large panel switch in Omaha, the Bell operating companies began to install automated switching equipment.|$|R
