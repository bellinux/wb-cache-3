More likely, they would say that there was 'a goddamned rock headed our way!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Although neither Bernard nor her {{publisher}} was {{enthusiastic about}} her choice, Brodie {{began to work}} on her new project. She resigned her professorship at UCLA in 1977 to devote herself to research, including, for the first time, in oral history collections. [...] Brodie conducted 150 interviews. [...] She tried unsuccessfully to interview Henry Kissinger, whom she knew <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>first-name</b> basis—-and Nixon for what she described {{in a letter to}} him as “a compassionate and accurate study.” (Nixon did not reply.) Though she could find no evidence, Brodie began to think that he had engaged in a homosexual relationship with his good friend Bebe Rebozo. Her psychoanalyst friends tried to warn her off this topic.|$|E

[...] "The last Jackson hero(ine) has carried peacock feathers to the dance. Holier than Mahalia." [...] "Janet will please most people," [...] remarked The Daily Telegraph, [...] "because it is crammed with the sort of tender, joyous pop music that lingers long after smarter records have been forgotten." ...|$|E
500|$|Carson {{then moved}} to the factual {{evidence}} and questioned Wilde about his acquaintances with younger, lower-class men. Wilde admitted being <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>first-name</b> basis and lavishing gifts upon them, but insisted that nothing untoward had occurred and that the men were merely good friends of his. Carson repeatedly pointed out the unusual nature of these relationships and insinuated that the men were prostitutes. Wilde replied {{that he did not}} believe in social barriers, and simply enjoyed the society of young men. Then Carson asked Wilde directly whether he had ever kissed a certain servant boy, Wilde responded, [...] "Oh, dear no. He was a particularly plain boy– unfortunately ugly– I pitied him for it." [...] Carson pressed him on the answer, repeatedly asking why the boy's ugliness was relevant. Wilde hesitated, then for the first time became flustered: [...] "You sting me and insult me and try to unnerve me; and at times one says things flippantly when one ought to speak more seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{magazine}} declared [...] "s {{princess of}} America's black royal family, everything Janet Jackson does is important. Whether proclaiming herself {{in charge of}} her life, as she did on Control (1986), or {{commander in chief of}} a rhythm army dancing to fight society's problems (Rhythm Nation 1814, from 1989), she's influential. And when she announces her sexual maturity, as she does on her new album, Janet, it's a cultural moment." [...] Claiming the album should bring her critical praise, the magazine concludes its review with the statement [...] "he princess of America's black royal family has announced herself sexually mature and surrendered none of her crown's luster in the process. Black women and their friends, lovers and children have a victory in Janet." [...] Robert Christgau originally gave the album an [...] "honorable mention" [...] in consumer guide for The Village Voice, wherein he complimented its erotic songs and cited [...] "Funky Big Band", [...] "Throb", and [...] "Be a Good Boy" [...] as highlights. Billboard magazine gave a positive review, stating [...] "estined to be an instant smash, Ms. Jackson's latest is a glamorous assortment of styles—pop, dance, R, rock, jazz, rap—each delivered with consummate skill and passion. Janet is described as [...] "a career-defining record earning Janet the right to operate <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>first-name</b> basis." ...|$|E

40|$|Economists worry {{endlessly}} {{about the}} manufacturing sector (could GM really go bankrupt?), {{not to mention the}} high-tech sector (whither the Nasdaq?). Economists sometimes refer to the service sector, and pay attention to specific industries such as health. They probably don’t even know there is something called the “care sector ” unless they are girls or as Governor Schwarzenegger puts it, “girlie men. ” Yet the care sector is a topic of increasing interest among political activists and trade unions, as well as feminist scholars. Tonight, I will try to persuade you that some economists actually have something useful to say about it. I define the care sector as economic activities in the home, market, community and state that have a particularly strong personal and emotional dimension: activities such as childrearing, child care, health care, elder care, and education. These are activities that are often provided <b>on</b> <b>a</b> face-to-face or <b>first-name</b> basis, and they often involve the care of dependents. Much of my work on the care sector has focused on women’s non-market work in the home, but tonight I will focus on the portion of the care sector that involves paid employment. Economists and policy makers often mistakenly assume that paid care services can be produced like any other commodity. They are, obviously, subject to the laws of supply an...|$|R
500|$|As with Persona 3, the [...] {{localization}} of Persona 4 {{was handled}} by Yu Namba and Nich Maragos of Atlus USA. In addition, {{there were four}} translators and two further editors. The Social Links were divided equally between the translators and editors. During localization of the game, character's names were altered for the international audience for familiarity, including Kuma being renamed Teddie. A similar change was done for Rise Kujikawa's stage name, [...] in Japan, to [...] "Risette". Nanba also explained the change from [...] to [...] "Social Link", regarding the gameplay mechanic, as [...] "community" [...] has a different meaning in English, whereas Igor in his speeches often refers to [...] "society" [...] and [...] "bonds". Names were also altered for pun and other linguistic effect including dungeon items' names such as the [...] becoming the [...] "Goho-M", as the item's use of returning the player to the entrance was taken to be [...] "go home" [...] and changing Junes's slogan from [...] to [...] "Every day's great at your Junes", and eliminating some Japanese cultural references that would not transfer, such as the reference to Kosuke Kindaichi. There were also some issues regarding the translation {{of the names of}} Yukiko, Kanji and Rise's dungeons, as the English names were made to fit the original Japanese graphics, and the [...] "Void Quest" [...] dungeon's graphics were specifically made to harken back to the NES. He also remarked on how popular the interpretations of Kanji's Shadow were in the west, and how it did not change how the character was seen by the other audience. A different change was the fact the main characters in the English dub referred to others members of the cast <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>first-name</b> basis, while the Japanese version differed in this regard. For the dub, the editors sometimes switched between first-name and last-name referral for dramatic effect.|$|E
2500|$|Wallace-Johnson's {{charisma}} {{and lack of}} pretentiousness made him well liked among Sierra Leoneans. At one point, he declared to working class Creoles, [...] "I am not anything above yourselves. I am at par with you." [...] His opponents conceded that Wallace-Johnson's [...] "considerable personal magnetism for the masses" [...] were admirable qualities. According to , Wallace-Johnson's most important characteristic was his [...] "truculence and his apparent willingness to thumb his nose at officialdom". In public, he spoke jokingly of colonial officials who most Sierra Leoneans feared. He casually referred to officials <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>first-name</b> basis and criticised them [...] "in diatribes and invectives the like of which {{had never before been}} heard in the Freetown society where decorum and savoir faire were the hall-marks of the leaders". His associations with England's members of Parliament also lent credence to his reputation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{six degrees}} of {{separation}} concept was examined Milgram's 1967 [...] "small world experiment" [...] that tracked chains of acquaintances in the United States. In the experiment, Milgram sent several packages to 160 random people living in Omaha, Nebraska, asking them to forward the package to a friend or acquaintance who they thought would bring the package closer to a set final individual, a stockbroker from Boston, Massachusetts. Each [...] "starter" [...] received instructions to mail a folder via the U.S. Post Office to a recipient, but with some rules. Starters could only mail the folder to someone they actually knew personally <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>first-name</b> basis.

5000|$|Goodmountain {{is a major}} {{character}} in The Truth. 'He' {{and a group of}} other dwarves, including 'his' fiancee, Boddony, introduce the moveable type printing press to Ankh-Morpork and found the city's first newspaper, the Ankh-Morpork Times. Like most dwarfs, 'he' is primarily interested in gold and technology, but 'he' seems to also want to keep the Times going for reasons beyond this. 'His' name is <b>a</b> play <b>on</b> Johann Gutenberg, the German inventor of moveable type, being a rough translation of [...] "Gutenberg" [...] to English. It is also unclear as to whether Goodmountain is a male or female dwarf, given that 'he' is never referred to using a gender-specific pronoun in The Truth, the traditional dwarf cultural taboo against openly identifying as being female, and also due to Gunilla being <b>a</b> female <b>first-name</b> in the Swedish language.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new idea}} in describing people using their first names, i. e., the name assigned at birth. We show that describing people in terms of similarity to a vec-tor of possible first names is a powerful description of facial appearance {{that can be used}} for face naming and building facial attribute classifiers. We build models for 100 common first names used in the United States and for each pair, construct <b>a</b> pairwise <b>first-name</b> classifier. These classifiers are built using training im-ages downloaded from the internet, with no additional user interaction. This gives our approach important advantages in building practical systems that do not require additional human intervention for labeling. We use the scores from each pairwise name classifier as a set of facial attributes. We show several surprising results. Our name attributes predict the correct first names of test faces at rates far greater than chance. The name attributes are applied to gender recognition and to age classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with all training images automati-cally gathered from the internet. 1...|$|R
