5|$|By {{recasting}} {{a difference}} of judgment over {{the merits of the}} early work on the hydrogen bomb project into a matter <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> risk, Teller effectively damned Oppenheimer in a field where security was necessarily of paramount concern. Teller's testimony thereby rendered Oppenheimer vulnerable to charges by a Congressional aide that he was a Soviet spy, which resulted in the destruction of Oppenheimer's career.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, donors at a UN-sponsored conference pledged over $250 {{million to}} help improve security.

5|$|Once {{the embassy}} had been tipped off {{that there was}} a spy {{operating}} in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found it increasingly difficult to gather intelligence. The British Field Office had warned the embassy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information given by a defector to the United States. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted to look in the ambassador's safe.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential for negative consequences {{as a result of}} leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, if the price <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require the portfolio manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E
