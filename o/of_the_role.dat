5|$|Liver {{cells are}} {{another example of}} {{specialized}} cells that contain an abundance of smooth ER. These cells provide an example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrates {{in the form of}} glycogen.

This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.|$|E
