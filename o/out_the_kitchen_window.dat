25|$|The plot {{begins in}} 1992 with an elderly woman, Aliide Truu, {{who lives in}} a remote portion of Estonia. The woman had {{isolated}} herself from the surrounding society and watches the youth of her nation, including her daughter, leaving the countryside for the more urban regions and Finland. One day while looking <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> she discovers Zara, the granddaughter of her sister Ingel. Zara had been forced to partake in the sex trade by the Russian Mafia but escaped them. The only guide she had to help her find help, was a photograph from her grandmother with Aliide's name on it. The story then continues with a series of flashbacks which develops the relationship of Aliide and her sister, which hinged upon their competition for the love of Hans Pekk during World War II. The story ends as Aliide begins to reconcile herself with her jealousy of her sister and Zara's redemption from her disenchantment with the world caused by her sexual subjugation.|$|E
50|$|The {{force of}} the impact causes the {{basement}} door to break into pieces, revealing a flattened Tom, who immediately runs away as Pecos follows. Tom slams anything he can find onto Pecos {{in order to keep}} him at bay: first a bread bin, then the top half of a Dutch Door shut (without realizing that, because Pecos is a mouse, he can simply walk underneath it), and finally a mop. As if uninterrupted, Pecos keeps coming and tries to reason with the cat that he needs a whisker to fix his guitar and is not going to let a broken string {{stand in the way of}} his fame and fortune. As a last resort, Tom jumps <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> and runs back to the front door before shutting it. He slowly checks through the peep-hole to see if the coast is clear, but Pecos suddenly reaches through and yanks off a whisker.|$|E

And time enough, too," [...] I added, peeping <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> [...] "for here is the man himself coming through the garden." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Woodrow Wilson {{is going}} to make peace, I understand. First Henry Ford had a try at it and now comes Wilson. But peace is not made with ink, Woodrow, and that you may tie to," [...] said Susan, apostrophizing <b>the</b> unlucky President <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> nearest <b>the</b> United States. [...] "Lloyd George's speech will tell the Kaiser what is what, and you may keep your peace screeds at home and save postage." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mariette Beco {{was twelve}} years old when she {{reported}} Marian apparitions in 1933 in Banneux, Belgium, a hamlet about 15 km southeast of the city of Li√®ge. In this case, the Lady in White reportedly declared she was the Virgin of the Poor and said: [...] "Believe in me and I will believe in you." [...] According to Mariette, she first saw the Blessed Virgin on the evening of Sunday, January 15, 1933, as she was looking <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window.</b> A woman in white stood in the garden and called to her to come out, but her mother would not let her. She is described as a young lady in the yard smiling at her. The woman was bent slightly forward and wearing a long white gown with a blue sash, and a transparent white veil. Three days later the woman in white reappeared and told Mariette she was [...] "Our Lady of the Poor". The lady appeared eight times in all, the last on March 2, 1933.|$|E
50|$|Terrified by this vision, Matt {{runs out}} to the {{policeman}} (Michael McCusker) and demands his help. The cop enters the house to find {{that there is nothing}} there. Lee worries that her brother and sister-in-law are getting a reputation for crying wolf, which will lead to the police being less willing to take the Millers seriously. The next day, Mason arrives to pick up Flora and finds her playing a game of hide and seek with Priscilla. Flora tells him that she offered her doll to Priscilla in exchange for not murdering her family but since Mason interrupted the trade, Flora will merely be killed last. Hearing this, Mason takes Flora away from the house and promises Lee that she will never see her again, causing Lee to end her sobriety. Shelby and Matt find her in the kitchen slumped on the ground with all the kitchen knives mysteriously stuck in the ceiling, an action that Lee denies committing. Matt puts Lee to bed and hearing Shelby calling for him, heads back down to the kitchen. Shelby sees an apparition of a woman <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> and Matt confirms that he sees the same thing. The couple follow the apparition outside to discover a storm cellar in the backyard, which they open and begin to investigate.|$|E
5000|$|Lisa's skewed {{world view}} and {{domestic}} ignorance provides {{fertile ground for}} recurring gags. Much of her early life was lived in Hungary, {{where she grew up}} pampered in a wealthy family, which explains her lack of education and her ignorance of normal household chores and everyday living. Oliver and she are both veterans of World War II; he, a United States Army Air Forces flier, and she, a member of the Hungarian underground. Her waterless [...] "coffee" [...] oozes from the pot in a thick tar-like sludge. Her [...] "hotcakes" [...] (pronounced [...] "hotscakes") are inedible, so tough that Oliver makes head gaskets for his truck and tractor using the recipe. In one episode, hotcake batter is used as fireplace mortar; in another, hotcakes are used to reshingle a roof. Her sandwiches include such epicurean delights as liverwurst and jelly. Instead of washing dishes, Lisa sometimes tosses them <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> (a gag also used by Phyllis Diller in The Pruitts of Southampton). In one episode Oliver finds Lisa mending holes in his socks with a stapler. As he begins to comment on it, a visiting Fred Ziffel says, [...] "I see you're mending socks! Darned if you don't do it better than Doris does!" [...] In the episode [...] "Alf and Ralph Break Up", Lisa admits that she has no cooking abilities and says her only talent is her Zsa Zsa Gabor imitation (the real-life sisters were often mistaken for one another).|$|E
60|$|The {{good cook}} {{had been in}} a state of {{enthusiastic}} delight, since, looking <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> where she had been sitting, with a manuscript book of recipes in her lap, planning the luncheon and dinner, she had seen the lord of Cobhurst drive up to the gate with dear Miss Cicely. It was a joy like that of listening to a party of dinner guests, who were eating her favorite ice. With intense impatience she had awaited the appearance of Cicely from the doctor's office; and, having drawn her to one side, she hastily imparted her sentiments.|$|R
60|$|Like {{a prudent}} father, therefore, he {{determined}} to nip this passion in the bud, and forbade the youngster the house, though sorely {{did it go}} against his fatherly heart, and many a silent tear did it cause in the bright eye of his daughter. She showed herself, however, a pattern of filial piety and obedience. She never pouted and sulked; she never flew {{in the face of}} parental authority; she never fell into a passion, or fell into hysterics, as many romantic novel-read young ladies would do. Not she, indeed! She was none such heroical rebellious trumpery, I warrant ye. On the contrary, she acquiesced like an obedient daughter; shut the street-door in her lover's face, and if ever she did grant him an interview, it was either <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> or over <b>the</b> garden fence.|$|R
60|$|Nelly {{turned to}} him and, as he held her, her head bent far back. She lay tremblingly inert against his arms, staring up at him, panting. With {{her head on his}} {{shoulder}}--a soft burden of love that his shoulder rejoiced to bear--they stood gazing <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> narrow <b>kitchen</b> <b>window</b> of their sixth-story flat and noticed for the hundredth time that the trees in a vacant lot across were quite as red and yellow as the millionaire trees in Central Park along Fifth Avenue.|$|R
6000|$|Anne {{went back}} to Green Gables by way of Birch Path, shadowy, rustling, fern-scented, through Violet Vale and past Willowmere, where dark and light kissed each other under the firs, and down through Lover's Lane [...] . spots she and Diana had so named long ago. She walked slowly, enjoying the {{sweetness}} of wood and field and the starry summer twilight, and thinking soberly about the new duties she was to take up on the morrow. When she reached the yard at Green Gables Mrs. Lynde's loud, decided tones floated <b>out</b> through <b>the</b> open <b>kitchen</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{she still}} had her dreams, though more rarely. She had read a few books--what, it is pretty hard to imagine, Seaside Library novels most likely; yet they had been food for fancy. 'Sometimes,' she said, 'when I was that dizzy from {{the heat of the}} cooking that if I didn't take {{a breath of fresh air}} I'd faint, I'd stick my head <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> and close my eyes and see most {{wonderful}} things. All of a sudden I'd be traveling down a country road, and everything clean and quiet, no dust, no dirt; just streams ripplin' down sweet meadows, and lambs playing, breezes blowing the breath of flowers, and soft sunshine over everything; and lovely cows lazying knee-deep in quiet pools, and young girls bathing in a curve of stream all white and slim and natural--and I'd know I was in Arcady. I'd read about that country once, in a book. And maybe knights, all flashing in the sun, would come riding around a bend in the road, or a lady on a milk-white mare, and in the distance I could see the towers of a castle rising, or I just knew, on the next turn, that I'd come upon some palace, all white and airy and fairy-like, with fountains playing, and flowers all over everything, and peacocks on the lawn..... and then I'd open my eyes, and the heat of the cooking range would strike on me, and I'd hear Jake sayin'--he was my husband--I'd hear Jake sayin', [...] "Why ain't you served them beans? Think I can wait here all day!" [...] Romance!--I reckon the nearest I ever come to it was when a drunken Armenian cook got the snakes and tried to cut my throat with a potato knife and I got my arm burned on the stove before I could lay him <b>out</b> with <b>the</b> potato stomper.|$|R
6000|$|... "Put {{flour in}} ma hat, de ole boy take 'em!" [...] {{finished}} Aleck, {{and then he}} blundered <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and tried to find Larry and the others. But all of the cadets, who had been watching proceedings through <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>window,</b> had vanished {{and could not be}} found.|$|R
