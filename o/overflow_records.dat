40|$|Variable-length {{records are}} very {{frequent}} in database environments. This work gives {{a set of}} algorithms for maintaining {{a new model of}} static hashed files designed to accommodate variable-length records. Two special techniques for variable-length records are used. First, records are ordered by length and not by key value, e. g., the shortest (longest) records are stored in the main (overflow) blocks. Second, at the cost of a small directory for the <b>overflow</b> <b>records</b> stored in the main file blocks, the successful and unsuccessful searches are faster. The directory consists of the triplet key value, record length, and pointer to the overfiow block. In addition, this work reports a simulation of the file structure. Numerical results show the benefits of the model. These two techniques may be applied in any primary key file organization that uses overflow chaining, including the recent versions of dynamic hashing. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: When a file {{is loaded}} into a {{direct access storage device}} using key-to-address transformations, {{the number and}} size of storage blocks can be selected. In this study, a {{selection}} that minimizes the combined cost of storage space and accesses to the storage device is determined for the case where no record additions or deletions occur after loading. The analysis {{is based on the assumption}} that for a given set of keys, a transformation exists that gives a uniform probability distribution over the available addresses. Under this assumption, formulas are derived for the average number of <b>overflow</b> <b>records</b> and for the average number of accesses required to retrieve a record. Given these formulas, the costs are expressed as a function of storage used, number of accesses, cost per unit of storage, and cost per access. Minima are computed for a range of block sizes and operational conditions. The results seem to indicate that current file design practices are abundant with storage space. Finally, the results are condensed in an easy to use approximate formula...|$|E
40|$|In the United Kingdom few river {{catchments}} have <b>overflow</b> <b>records</b> {{longer than}} 35 years. The wealth of precipitation {{data in the}} United Kingdom enables long records of riverflow to be produced with a catchment model calibrated over the recent period. For most parts of England and Wales it is shown that monthly sequences of riverflow that account for 90 – 95 per cent of the variance of the measured riverflow can be produced back to 1860. Reconstructions are made on 10 catchments (size range 400 – 4500 km 2) in both upland and lowland Britain. Reliable reconstructions are possible using as few as 4 rainguage records. The reconstructions provide not only a valuable database {{for the study of}} the effect of climatic change on riverflow, but also allow stationarity, homoscedasticy and changes in the frequency of extreme events to be examined. It is shown that on the 10 catchments extreme droughts with a duration of 18 months are three times more likely to have occurred between 1925 and 1979 than between 1870 and 1924. The significance of this and other findings are discussed in the context of water resource analysis. The reconstructed riverflows, apart from their obvious use for water resource analysis, also provide a valuable climatological database for the possible further extension of riverflow using proxy climate indicators such as tree rings...|$|E

40|$|Significant {{changes in}} the helium and carbon isotopic {{composition}} of shallow thermal waters vs. gas and a crater fumarolic gas have been recorded at Stromboli prior and during the 2002 – 2003 eruption. The 3 He/ 4 He ratios corrected for air contamination (Rc/Ra), and δ 13 C of fumarolic gases gradually increased from May to November 2002 before the eruption onset. These variations imply early degassing of a gas-rich magma at depth that likely fed both the intense Strombolian activity and small lava <b>overflows</b> <b>recorded</b> during that period. The lava effusion of late December 2002 was shortly preceded by a marked Rc/Ra decrease both in water and fumarolic gases. Comparison of He/CO 2 and CH 4 /CO 2 ratios in dissolved gas and with δ 13 CCO 2 values rules out the Rc/Ra decrease due to an increasing input of radiogenic 4 He. The Rc/Ra decrease is attributed to the He isotope fractionation during rapid magma ascent and degassing. A new uprising of 3 He-rich magma probably occurred in January to February 2003, when Rc/Ra ratios displayed the highest values in dissolved gases ever measured before (4. 56 Rc/Ra). The increase in He/CO 2 and CH 4 /CO 2 ratios and decrease in δ 13 C of dissolved CO 2 was recorded after the 5 April 2003 explosive paroxysm, likely caused by enhanced gas-water interaction inducing CO 2 dissolution. No anomalous Rc/Ra values were recorded in the same period, when usual Strombolian activity gradually resumed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this demo, we {{showcase}} DiffQ – a {{congestion control}} protocol inspired by theoretical cross-layer optimization approaches. DiffQ can support congestion control for network flows that use either single-path or opportunistic multi-path routing. Our demo {{will focus on}} the performance in single-path routing environments, where contemporary end-point congestion control algorithms like TCP face severe unfairness or even starvation. This is primarily due to the interaction of such protocols with MAC layer unfairness. We demonstrate micro (5 flows) as well as macro-evaluations (60 flows) of such cases. Our demo is conducted on WiSeNet – a 70 -node wireless mesh test-bed hosted in the computer science building at NCSU. Distributed over a 100, 000 sq ft building, {{this is one of the}} largest test-bed installations both in terms of number of nodes and coverage area, hence an ideal testing ground for such scenarios.

Here we compare Nd isotopic measurements obtained from ferromanganese oxides leached from bulk sediments and planktonic foraminifera, {{as well as from}} oxidatively-reductively cleaned foraminiferal shells from sediment cores in the North Atlantic. Sedimentary volcanic ash contributes a significant fraction of the Nd when the ferro-manganese (Fe-Mn) oxide coatings are leached from bulk sediments. Reductive leachates of marine sediments from North Atlantic core tops near Iceland, or directly downstream from Iceland-Scotland <b>Overflow</b> Waters, <b>record</b> ɛNd values that are significantly higher than seawater, indicating that volcanic material is easily leached by acid-reductive methods. The ɛNd values from sites more distal to Iceland are similar to modern seawater values, showing little contamination from Iceland-derived volcanogenic material. In all comparisons, core top planktonic foraminifera ɛNd values more closely approximate modern deep seawater than the bulk sediment reductive leached value suggesting that the foraminifera provide a route toward quantifying the Nd isotopic signature of deep North Atlantic water masses...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRecent decadal {{salinity}} {{changes in}} the Greenland-Scotland overflow-derived deep waters are quantified using CTD data from repeated hydrographic sections in the Irminger Sea. The Denmark Strait <b>Overflow</b> Water salinity <b>record</b> shows {{the absence of any}} net change over the 1980 s– 2000 s; {{changes in the}} Iceland–Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW) and in the deep water column (σ 0 > 27. 82), enclosing both overflows, show a distinct freshening reversal in the early 2000 s. The observed freshening reversal is a lagged consequence of the persistent ISOW salinification that occurred upstream, in the Iceland Basin, after 1996 in response to salinification of the northeast Atlantic waters entrained into the overflow. The entrainment salinity increase is explained by the earlier documented North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) -induced contraction of the subpolar gyre and corresponding northwestward advance of subtropical waters that followed the NAO decline in the mid- 1990 s and continued through the mid- 2000 s. Remarkably, the ISOW freshening reversal is not associated with changes in the overflow water salinity. This suggests that changes in the NAO-dependent relative contributions of subpolar and subtropical waters to the entrainment south of the Iceland–Scotland Ridge may dominate over changes in the Nordic Seas freshwater balance with respect to their effect on the ISOW salinity...|$|R
40|$|A little-known {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the volume of}} small objects based on Archimedes principle is described, which involves suspending an object in a water-filled container placed on electronic scales. The suspension technique is {{a variation on the}} hydrostatic weighing technique used for measuring volume. The suspension method was compared with two other traditional water displacement methods of measuring volume – i. e. placing an object in a measuring cylinder and recording the rise in the water level and immersing the object in a water-filled container with an <b>overflow</b> spout to <b>record</b> the volume of overflow. The accuracy and precision of the three methods was compared using 10 accurately machined PVC cylinders ranging in volume from 1. 5 to 15. 7 ml. The mean difference between the actual and measured volumes was 3. 3 +/- 7. 3 %, - 1. 6 +/- 7. 2 % and 0. 03 +/- 0. 45 %, for the level, overflow and suspension methods respectively. Each measurement was repeated twice to obtain the reproducibility of the three displacement techniques. The reproducibility was – 1. 7 +/- 8. 5 %, 0. 09 +/- 3 % and – 0. 04 +/- 0. 43 % for the level, overflow and suspension techniques respectively. The results show that the suspension technique is more accurate and precise than the traditional water displacement methods and is more accurate than measuring volume using Vernier calliper measurements...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Lucky Strike segment between 37 and 38 N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is {{the focus}} of the {{international}} MoMAR program to monitor seafloor-spreading processes. During the GRAVILUCK cruise in August 2006, hydrographic, velocity and light-scattering data were collected in the rift valley at Lucky Strike in order to investigate the regional dynamics and to provide background information for the monitoring effort. The survey observations reveal a remarkably simple dynamical setting dominated by persistent northward flow transporting ≈ 0. 2 Sv of water along the rift valley. Approximately half of this transport must upwell within a deep basin that occupies the northern half of the segment. In the comparatively shallow segment center, the along-valley transport takes place in two parallel, hydraulically controlled overflows on both sides of an active volcano that rises from the rift-valley floor. Within the better sampled of these <b>overflows</b> instantaneous velocities <b>recorded</b> during the survey were northward more than 95 % of the time and occasionally exceeded 20 cm s - 1. Similar to other laterally confined overflows in the deep ocean, the cross-sill density gradients are characterized by a lower layer with streamwise decreasing densities and an upper layer where the densities increase along the path of the flow. This vertical density-gradient dipole is the signature of the buoyancy flux associated with high levels of diapycnal mixing near the sill. Overall, the hydrography and dynamics in the rift valley of the Lucky Strike segment are highly reminiscent of many ridge-flank canyons in the western South Atlantic, where mean along-axial advection of density is balanced by vigorous diapycnal mixing. There is circumstantial evidence from historic hydrographic data suggesting that northward flow below ≈ 1800 m in the rift valley in the MoMAR region is persistent on time scales of years to decades and that it extends more than 200 km to the south. During GRAVILUCK the northward flow at Lucky Strike extended well above 1600 m, where two previous one year-long current meters had recorded southward mean flows near the Lucky Strike hydrothermal vent field. While interannual variability can potentially account for this difference, the data also allow for the possibility of a cyclonic re-circulation around an isolated topographic peak east of the vent field, resulting in the southward mean flows observed there. In addition to the light-scattering anomalies associated with plumes rising from the Lucky Strike vent field near the segment center, the GRAVILUCK data also show clear evidence for a separate hydrothermal particle plume emanating from a not-yet-discovered vent field in the southern half of the segment, probably near 2000 m...|$|R
