They abolished the New Court and restored the Old Court to power. In an 1829 case, the Court nullified decisions rendered by the New Court. In a 1935 case, the Court struck all the New Court cases from Kentucky common law.|$|E

5|$|In {{the state}} {{legislative}} elections of 1830, the ascendent Whig Party gained control <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> of the General Assembly. Rowan's strict adherence to Jeffersonian democracy and {{leadership of the}} New Court faction during the court controversy of the 1820s had put him at odds with Whig founder Henry Clay. By this time, however, not even Rowan's fellow Democrats endorsed his re-election. Henry Clay was elected instead.|$|E

50|$|The Argentine general {{election}} of 1989 {{was held on}} 14 May 1989.

This is the last presidential election the president was elected by the electoral college.|$|R
5|$|The Republicans won control <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> of the {{legislature}} {{for the first time}} in decades, while Dayton narrowly defeated Republican candidate Tom Emmer with 44% of the vote.

Both Dayton and Republican legislators claimed a popular mandate for their positions.|$|E

5|$|Clay, though embittered {{by another}} of his many defeats for the presidency, was appeased by Tyler's {{withdrawal}} from the still-unresolved Senate race, which would permit the election of Rives, and campaigned in Virginia for the Harrison/Tyler ticket. Tyler predicted the Whigs would easily take Virginia; he was embarrassed when he was proved wrong, but was consoled by an overall victory—Harrison and Tyler won by an electoral vote of 234–60 and with 53 {{percent of the popular}} vote. Van Buren took only seven scattered states out of 26. The Whigs gained control <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> of Congress.|$|E
50|$|Joint Sessions of the United States Congress {{occur on}} special {{occasions}} that require a concurrent resolution from <b>both</b> <b>House</b> and Senate. These sessions include the counting of electoral votes following a Presidential election and the President's State of the Union address. Other meetings <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>House</b> and Senate are called Joint Meetings of Congress, held after unanimous consent agreements to recess and meet. Meetings of Congress for Presidential Inaugurations may also be Joint Sessions, if <b>both</b> <b>House</b> and Senate are in session at the time, otherwise they are formal joint gatherings.|$|R
50|$|Although this Hornsby land {{transfer}} was {{registered in}} 1901, {{it is probable}} that both buildings existed before this time. The Architectural design <b>of</b> <b>both</b> Cabragh <b>House</b> and the adjoining Amber House indicates a date <b>of</b> construction for <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> somewhere between 1895 and 1905. To support this contention, an original photograph, principally of the two-storey house then at 36 Weka Street, has printed on its reverse “CABRAGH House school & home, Weka Street, Nelson NZ. Late 1890s school started & staffed by Hornsby sisters Charlotte (Lizzy), Ruth & Janetta”. Municipal drain layer plans and sheets also indicate a probable date <b>of</b> erection for <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> in early 1897.|$|R

5|$|In the 1946 elections, Republicans wrested control <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> of Congress {{from the}} Democrats {{for the first}} time since the Great Depression and gained control of the {{majority}} of state governments. The power of labor unions had expanded under Roosevelt and the Democrats, and when a 1946 railroad worker strike exacerbated a post-war recession the Republican majorities – over Barkley's objection – curbed union power via the Taft–Hartley Act. They also passed the Twenty-second Amendment, limiting the president to two terms, a posthumous slap at Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|In the 1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, {{receiving}} 49.2percent of {{the popular}} vote over Republican Bob Dole (40.7percent {{of the popular}} vote) and Reform candidate Ross Perot (8.4percent {{of the popular vote}}), becoming the first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon B.

The Republicans lost three seats in the House and gained two in the Senate, but retained control <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> of the 105th United States Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70percent of the Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.|$|E

Two years later, the DFL regained control <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>houses,</b> and with Governor Dayton in office, the party had same-party control of both the legislative and executive branches for the first time since 1990. Two years later, the Republicans regained control of the Minnesota House in the 2014 election, and in 2016, the GOP also regained control of the State Senate.|$|E
5|$|Originally from Ireland, Rutherford immigrated {{with his}} parents to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Colony, {{at the age of}} eighteen.

He was a representative <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> of the North Carolina House of Commons, as well as an unsuccessful candidate for governor. Rutherford was an advocate of the anti-federalist movement and was appointed President of the Legislative Council of the Southwest Territory in 1794.

5|$|The 1799 {{constitution}} contained, for {{the first}} time, {{the power of the}} governor to veto legislation; this power was substantially similar to, and probably based upon, that found in the 1792 New Hampshire Constitution and the 1798 Georgia Constitution. The governor's veto can be overridden by a majority vote <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> of the legislature. The 1891 constitution empowered the governor with a line-item veto, but its use was forbidden on constitutional amendments and laws related to the classification of property for tax purposes.|$|E
