5|$|Philosophy {{of physics}} {{is the study}} of the fundamental, {{philosophical}} questions underlying modern physics, the study of matter and energy and how they interact. The main questions concern the nature of space and time, atoms and atomism. Also included are the predictions of cosmology, the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the foundations <b>of</b> <b>statistical</b> mechanics, causality, determinism, and the nature of physical laws. Classically, several of these questions were studied as part of metaphysics (for example, those about causality, determinism, and space and time).|$|E

40|$|The Value <b>of</b> a <b>Statistical</b> Life {{represents}} {{how much}} a population values reducing the probability of death. American citizens and government agencies use the Value <b>of</b> a <b>Statistical</b> Life estimates in benefit-cost analysis to pass life-saving policies. The public uses this measurement as a scientific and objective tool to identify potentially favorable policy from ineffective and inefficient policy. Institutional incentives, however, are aligned for agencies to exaggerate Value <b>of</b> a <b>Statistical</b> Life calculations and overregulate markets. This thesis summarizes how the Value <b>of</b> a <b>Statistical</b> Life data sources, methods of estimation, and inconsistent behavioral reference points distort the statistical calculations. Despite the distorted estimation, agencies still rely heavily on the Value <b>of</b> a <b>Statistical</b> Life {{as a tool to}} pass policy. Public choice theory explains that agencies employ distorted information as a tactic to pass regulation. The theory demonstrates that regulators are self-interested not unlike the general public. This thesis provides a public choice analysis and concludes that agencies are incentivized to employ distorted data sources, methods of calculation, and public risk perceptions to inflate the Value <b>of</b> a <b>Statistical</b> Life and overregulate. As such, the Value <b>of</b> a <b>Statistical</b> Life will continue to be biased and inaccurate with the current methods of calculation and addressing political incentives...|$|R
