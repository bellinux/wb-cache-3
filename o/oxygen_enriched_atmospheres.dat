40|$|Safety is {{of major}} {{importance}} to facilities and companies working with combustible materials like dust. To {{reduce the risk}} associated with dust, we need to assess the risk of explosion. This assessment can {{be based on the}} determination of the explosion characteristics of the dust. A fuel such as coal is allowed to combust in oxy-fuel atmospheres (mixtures of oxygen and carbon dioxide) and the explosion risk increases especially in <b>oxygen</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>atmospheres</b> with an O 2 -concentration greater than 21 %. To determine the explosion characteristics of the bituminous South African coal, experiments are performed with different mixture concentrations of coal, CO 2 and O 2. Measuring the minimum ignition energy (MIE) which is an important ignition sensitivity parameter shows that the MIE decreases significantly when the oxygen concentration in the mixture is increased. The violence of the explosion, which is a parameter for the explosion severity, is expressed by the maximum rate of pressure rise (dP/dt) max or Kst-value. This Kst is measured with a standard test apparatus with a content of 20 L using pyrotechnical igniters. This paper also explores the maximum burning velocity which is derived from the pressure histories. In order to achieve the burning velocities, experimental data are analyzed based upon the theoretical model of Dahoe and Van den Bulck. These models were induced by using a two-zone model for the adiabatic combustion in closed vessels. The results revealed that there is considerable dependence among the severity characteristic and the burning velocity and the oxygen concentration. However it is also observed that these coal characteristics are strongly dependent on the dust concentration. Furthermore the burning velocity reaches its maximum value when the rate of pressure rise reaches its maximum. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} a careful {{investigation}} on {{the degradation of}} an organically modified montmorillonite sample (Cloisite 15 A) thermal treated under different atmospheres, namely nitrogen, air and <b>oxygen</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>atmosphere</b> was performed. The exposure time of the thermal treatment ranged between 5 and 300 min. The chemical composition evolution as function of the thermal treatment conditions of the clay organic modifier was monitored by means of combined thermogravimetry/Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TGA-FTIR). Moreover, the morphological behaviour of treated Cloisite 15 A samples as function of the time and of the decomposition atmosphere was investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). In order to understand the possible different interactions of neat and degraded modified clay with a polymeric matrix, PA 6 based composites containing 5 % of clay were prepared in the melt and fully characterized by a rheological, mechanical and morphological point of view. The results showed that during the thermal treatment the organic modifier in the interlamellar spaces undergoes a rearrangement, while the external unbound modifier degrades. At long exposure times, the degradation gradually extends to the clay galleries involving the internal modifier. These effects are more intense, as expected, when increasing oxygen concentration of the treatment atmosphere. As expected, the properties of the prepared nanocomposites were influenced by the degradation level of the incorporated clay. In particular, the morphology and mechanical properties of the composites worsened by increasing the time of the thermal treatment of the cla...|$|R

Experimental tests were performed at Cranfield University using a 100 kWth retrofitted oxy-combustor. In parallel, a kinetic simulation model using Aspen Plus was designed and validated {{to serve as a}} computer tool to predict the behaviour of the oxy-combustion process {{for a wide range of}} fuels and conditions. The main input parameters varied in the simulation study were: fuel type (El Cerrejon coal, Daw Millcoal, Cereal Co-product biomass, and coal/biomass blends); percentage of recycled flue gas (55, 60,and 65 %); type of recycled flue gas (wet or dry); percentage of excess oxygen (0 and 5 %), and the amount of air ingress into the process (0, 2, 10, and 18 % of the total flue gas fed to the oxycombustor). The last input condition, percentage of air ingress, is of greater importance as a result of the unit being a retrofitted oxy-combustor; for which air ingress is more probable and this represents a situation likely to be an issue for any boiler retrofitted for oxyfuel firing.

Palm oil wastewater samples were taken from facultative pond effluent.

40|$|The January 2, 1992 {{explosion}} in an electrochemistry laboratory at SRI International (SRI) {{resulted in the}} death of scientist Andrew Riley, and gained some notoriety due to its association with experimental work in the controversial field of cold fusion research. Selected components of explosion debris were subjected to forensic analyses at LLNL to elucidate potential causes of, or contributing factors to, the explosion. Interrogation of the debris by LLNL encompassed nuclear, chemical, physical, and materials investigations. Nuclear studies for the determination of tritium and neutron-activation products in stainless steel and brass were negative. No evidence of signature species indicative of orthodox nuclear events was detected. The inorganic and particulate analyses were likewise negative with respect to residues of unexpected chemical species. Such target compounds included conventional explosives, accelerants, propellants, or any exceptional industrial chemicals. The GC-MS analyses of trace organic components in the explosion debris provided perhaps the most interesting results obtained at LLNL. Although no evidence of organic explosives, oxidizers, or other unusual compounds was detected, the presence of a hydrocarbon oil in the interior of the electrochemical cell was established.
