This version gives relevance to the motive of an act and links it to its consequences. An act can therefore not be wrong if the decision to act was based on a right motive. A possible inference is, that <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be blamed for mistaken judgements if the motivation was to do good.|$|E
25|$|Ferris {{admits that}} there is a {{tendency}} for descriptions of cosmology towards philosophy and also to lean towards theology. His theories lean towards the basis that the span of human being existence is part of the universe design. His views of God are not as taught in churches and synagogs but that the existence of the ultimate cause and the essential nature of things are really unknown. He points out that <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> support the personal theology theories of conventional religions against today's established principles of cosmology. Ferris wraps up his book with intellectual arguments for God with his Contrarian Theological Afterword.|$|E

To historian Nelson Werneck Sodré, he was [...] "not only the greatest military commander of his continent , in his time, but [...] a great politician". Moreover, Caxias was [...] "—more than D. PedroII—the Empire." [...] Francisco Doratioto said that the duke [...] "in Paraguay had doubts, pride, resentment, and made mistakes; in short, {{he was a real}} character ... Caxias, however, was able to rise above his limitations, imposed on himself great personal sacrifices and incorporated the responsibility of accomplishing the objective... In this context, Caxias was, indeed, a hero; he carried with him, it is true, social and political prejudices of his time, but <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> demand from the past the observance of present-day values." ...|$|E

A final batch—including plate 1, several {{in the middle of}} the series, and the last 17 plates—are likely to have been produced after the end of the war, when materials were more abundant. The titles of some plates, written beneath each, indicate his presence: I saw this (...) and <b>One</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> look (...) [...] While it is unclear how much of the conflict Goya witnessed, it is generally accepted that he observed first-hand many of the events recorded in the first two groups. A number of other scenes are known to have been related to him second hand. It is known that he used a sketchbook when visiting battle sites; at his studio, he set to work on copper plate once he had absorbed and assimilated meaning from his sketches. All drawings are from the same paper, and all the copper plates are uniform.|$|E
500|$|The main rivalry {{leading into}} the event on the Raw brand was between John Cena and Randy Orton over the WWE Championship. At WWE's August {{pay-per-view}} event SummerSlam, Cena successfully defended the championship against Orton, and the following night on Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, Orton interfered in Cena's match with King Booker and cost him the match. After the match ended, Orton attacked Cena's real-life father, in storyline, by kicking {{him in the head}}. As a result of Orton's actions, the two met in a championship match at WWE's September pay-per-view event Unforgiven, in which Cena was disqualified for ignoring the referee's commands; as per WWE rules, a title can only change hands via pinfall or submission, Orton was not awarded the title. Following their match, Cena's father gained revenge on Orton by kicking him in the head the same way Orton had done to him earlier. Later in the night after the event went off the air, authority figure Jonathan Coachman made a rematch between the two at No Mercy in a Last Man Standing match, which involves two competitors fighting until <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> stand up on his feet before the referee counts to ten. On the October 1 episode of Raw, Cena legitimately tore his right pectoral muscle during a match with Mr. Kennedy, though the injury was blamed on television on a post-match attack by Orton. Due to the severity of his injury, Cena was forced to vacate the title. Although Cena's match against Orton was canceled, World Wrestling Entertainment Chairman Vince McMahon stated that there would be [...] "a new WWE Champion crowned at No Mercy".|$|E

2500|$|The best {{illustration}} for {{a novice}} is the predicament encountered by a criminal trial. The null hypothesis, H0, {{asserts that the}} defendant is innocent, whereas the alternative hypothesis, H1, asserts that the defendant is guilty. The indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt. The H0 (status quo) stands in opposition to H1 and is maintained unless H1 is supported by evidence [...] "beyond a reasonable doubt". However, [...] "failure to reject H0" [...] in this case does not imply innocence, but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict. So the jury does not necessarily accept H0 but fails to reject H0.
