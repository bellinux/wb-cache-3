Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods <b>of</b> <b>suicide,</b> such as firearms, drugs, and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting <b>of</b> <b>suicide,</b> and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, {{there is little evidence}} for their effectiveness.|$|E
