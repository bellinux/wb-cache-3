5|$|After Marie Henriette's death, Leopold's {{relationship}} with Caroline became flagrantly <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> placed her across from his Laeken mansion, in the Villa Vanderborght, even building a pedestrian bridge (above the ground, {{and over the}} fences of the mansion) {{so he could see}} her at will. The bridge reveals the king's jealousy, although this may have been justified, as her former lover Durrieux had been caught with her on several occasions. Caroline tried to pass him off as her brother when Leopold caught the two together; one publication reported that she and Durrieux had placed secret electric bells in all her residences so that servants could warn her when the king was approaching.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials that}} the Donner Party {{had so far}} endured {{resulted}} in splintered groups, each looking out for themselves and distrustful of the others. Grass was becoming scarce, and the animals were steadily weakening. To relieve the load of the animals, everyone was expected to walk. Keseberg ejected Hardkoop from his wagon, telling the elderly man {{that he had to}} walk or die. A few days later, Hardkoop sat next to a stream, his feet so swollen that they split <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was not seen again. William Eddy pleaded with the others to find Hardkoop, but they all refused, swearing that they would waste no more resources on a man who was almost 70 years old.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October 1944, Foskett was {{returning}} to base following an operation when his Spitfire developed engine trouble between the islands of Skiathos and Skópelos over the Aegean Sea. He attempted to bail out of the aircraft, but his altitude was too low for his parachute to <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was consequently killed. Foskett's body was later recovered, and he was buried at sea; he is commemorated on the Malta Memorial. Foskett's younger brother Bruce William, a Royal Australian Air Force navigator, {{had been killed in}} an operation over Berlin the previous February. By the time of his death, Foskett had been officially credited with a tally of 6½ Axis aircraft shot down. For his command of No.94 Squadron, Foskett was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, which was posthumously announced in a supplement to the London Gazette on 1 January 1945. On 16 February 1946, Foskett's father, Edward, attended an investiture ceremony at Government House, Sydney, where he was presented with his late son's decorations by the Governor-General of Australia, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester.|$|E

5|$|The Viet Cong {{were able}} to pick off one South Vietnamese paratrooper after another, some as they descended and others when their parachutes became stuck in the trees. Those paratroopers who reached the ground and survived tried to move forward, but the Viet Cong {{soldiers}} in defilade position fired on the paratroopers exposed in the open rice paddies. Undeterred, the ARVN 8th Airborne Battalion launched small-unit attacks, but on each occasion they were repelled, and sporadic fighting continued until sundown. By {{the end of the}} day, the airborne battalion had lost 19 soldiers killed in action and another 33 wounded. American advisers Captain Fletcher Ware and Sergeant Russell Kopti, who had parachuted in with the South Vietnamese, were also wounded. As night fell, Hoang knew that South Vietnamese forces were closing in from three directions. The eastern flank remained <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> ordered both elements of the 261st and 514th Battalions, exhausted and low on ammunition, to assemble {{at the south end of}} Ap Tan Thoi. They evacuated through the rice fields, taking their dead and wounded comrades.|$|E
25|$|During pre-qualifying for the 1977 British Grand Prix Purley {{sustained}} multiple bone fractures {{after his}} car's throttle stuck <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> {{crashed into a}} wall. His deceleration from 173km/h (108mph) to 0 in a distance of 66cm (26in) {{is one of the}} highest G-loads survived in a crash. He scored no championship points during his Formula One career. He died in a plane crash, having retired from motorsport and taken up aerobatics, in 1985.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} to Formula One in 1977 {{with his own}} LEC chassis designed by Mike Pilbeam and run by Mike Earle. It was this car in which he suffered serious injuries in an accident during practice for that year's British Grand Prix. He survived an estimated 179.8 g when he decelerated from 173km/h (108mph) to 0 in a distance of 66cm (26inches) after his throttle became stuck wide <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> hit a wall. This was the highest measured g-force ever survived by a human being (until in 2003, Kenny Bräck's crash violence recording system measured 214 g). Purley suffered multiple fractures to his legs, pelvis and ribs.|$|E

25|$|John Laurence Miller (born April 29, 1947) is an American former {{professional}} golfer. He {{was one of}} the {{top players}} in the world during the mid-1970s. He was the first to shoot 63 in a major championship to win the 1973 U.S. <b>Open,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> ranked second in the world on Mark McCormack's world golf rankings in both 1974 and 1975 behind Jack Nicklaus. Miller won 25 PGA Tour events, including two majors. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1998. He is currently the lead golf analyst for NBC Sports, a position he has held since January 1990. He is also an active golf course architect.|$|E
25|$|Due to his successes, Yue {{was awarded}} the Five Star Medal and {{promoted}} to deputy commander of the 21st PS/4th PG, though {{by the fall of}} Shanghai in late November the whole unit was reduced to two operational Hawk IIIs. These were flown by Yue and his superior, Captain Tung Ming-teh, to Nanking on 3 December. Just after arriving at their new airfield, an air raid warning was sounded as a large IJNAS formation approached. Yue and Tung again took off, and went on to engage the whole bomber squadron escorted by 11 A5Ms by themselves. Yue's machine was eventually hit and he bailed out, but his parachute failed to <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> fell to his death. Tung survived and confirmed Yue's death.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} played on a cold icy field {{that would have a}} big impact on the game. The Browns took the opening kickoff and drove into Bills territory, but came up empty when Matt Bahr slipped while {{planting}} his foot on a 45-yard field goal attempt. On Buffalo's second play after the missed kick, Kelly threw a short pass to Andre Reed. Defensive back Felix Wright slipped while going into coverage, leaving Reed wide <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> ended up taking the ball 72 yards to the end zone. But Cleveland struck back with a 45-yard field goal by Bahr and a 52-yard touchdown pass from Kosar to Slaughter in the second quarter. Kelly's 33-yard touchdown pass to James Lofton put the Bills back in the lead, 14–10, but the Browns retook the lead with Ron Middleton's 3-yard catch shortly {{before the end of the}} first half.|$|E

25|$|The 1968 season {{led to the}} Golden Bears' {{turnaround}} in the 1970s. Willsey left in 1972 finishing with Cal tying for 2nd and 3rd in the Pacific-8 Conference in his last two years. His overall record was 40–42–1. In 1972, Mike White was hired. He was a Cal alumni and a Stanford assistant coach from 1964 to 1971. In 1972 both Stanford and Cal head coaching positions became <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> received invitations from both schools to lead their programs. He decided to leave Stanford and return to Cal. After two losing seasons, he brought home three winning seasons over the next four. In 1974, the team went 4–2–1 in the conference. It was led by quarterback Steve Bartkowski, who was an All-American and {{first in the nation}} with 2,580 yards. In 1975 he was the number one NFL draft pick for the Atlanta Falcons and was named the NFL Rookie of the Year. In 1975, behind an NCAA-leading offense anchored by All-Americans Chuck Muncie, Wesley Walker, Steve Rivera, and Ted Albrecht, the Golden Bears were co-Champions of the Pac-8 Conference. However, it was co-champion UCLA went to the Rose Bowl because of its season victory over Cal.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{wrote that}} Braun [...] "won on a technicality". Braun's sample was {{collected}} and sealed on a Saturday. Laurenzi {{said that no}} FedEx delivery center was <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> subsequently followed established protocol and stored the samples in a Rubbermaid container; he dropped the samples off to an open FedEx center on Monday. Braun, though, said {{there were at least}} five FedEx locations within 5 miles that were open until 9 p.m. and there also was a 24-hour location. MLB argued that {{there was no evidence of}} tampering of the sample, and the United States Anti-Doping Agency said the testosterone levels in the samples would not grow in a refrigerator over a weekend. MLB's drug-testing program states that the samples should be sent to the laboratory on the same day they are collected [...] "absent unusual circumstance".|$|E
500|$|In June, Hamilton's {{return to}} Fort Hamilton {{with a large}} group of militia-aligned Native Americans coincided with the arrival of one of the {{survivors}} of the June 14 Spafford Farm massacre. The survivor, Francis Spencer, arrived at the fort around the same time as Hamilton did - accompanied by U.S. aligned Menominee. Afraid that the fort, like his party at the farm, had also been attacked, Spencer retreated back into the woods. He avoided the fort for between six and nine days, when hunger finally drove him into the <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> realized his mistake. On June 16, about an hour after the fight at Horseshoe Bend, Hamilton arrived on the battlefield with U.S. aligned Menominee, Sioux and Ho-Chunk warriors. According to Dodge, the warriors were given some of the scalps his men had taken, with which they were [...] "delighted". Dodge also reported that the allied warriors then proceeded onto the battlefield and mutilated the corpses of the fallen Kickapoo.|$|E

500|$|Even {{after his}} {{conviction}} You continued to enjoy public support. [...] Petitions for clemency, {{one of which}} was signed by one of the jurors, were sent to the state governor. [...] County officials sympathized with You, supposedly leaving his cell door unlocked at night and encouraging him to escape. [...] You eventually did escape, early in the morning of January 14: one news report claimed the improvised lock to his cell door had been picked {{with the aid of a}} confederate. [...] You hid in the environs of South Bend for several days, during which he was hunted by a squad led by sheriff Thomas A. Roney. [...] On January 15 he was sighted by two men; the following day the county commissioners met and agreed to offer a reward of $200 for You's capture. On January 17 You was finally apprehended by a three-man posse. [...] You offered no resistance, and when asked how he escaped, said only that the door was <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> walked out.|$|E
2500|$|On October 1, 1995, Robert Douglas [...] "Firecracker" [...] Overacker {{went over}} the falls on a Jet Ski to raise {{awareness}} for the homeless.

2500|$|Three more A-12s {{were lost}} in later testing.

Lockheed test pilot Bill Parks could not overcome the roll. At about a 45 degree bank angle and [...] altitude he ejected and was blown sideways out of the aircraft. Although he was not very high off the ground, his parachute did <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> landed safely.|$|E
50|$|As a seething Sharik plots {{to again}} destroy the Professor's stuffed owl, the door <b>opens</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> is dragged by the scruff {{of the neck}} into the lab. There, <b>he</b> is sedated <b>and</b> an {{operation}} begins. As Bormenthal assists, the Professor trepans Sharik's skull and gives him a human pituitary gland. Sharik's torso is also <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> is given human testicles. These organs were cut from Klim Grigorievich Chugunkin - killed in a brawl thief-recidivist, an alcoholic and a bully. Only repeated injections of adrenaline prevent the dog from dying on the operating table.|$|R

2500|$|His eloquence was in vain, and {{his request}} {{to be shot}} was denied. On 10 November 1798, he was found guilty and was {{sentence}}d to be hanged on 12 November. Before this sentence was carried out, either he attempted suicide by slitting his throat or British soldiers tortured and mortally wounded Tone. The story goes that he was initially saved when the wound was sealed with a bandage, and he was told if he tried to talk the wound would <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> would bleed to death. He responded by saying [...] "I can yet find words to thank you sir; it is the most welcome news you could give me. What should I wish to live for?".|$|E
2500|$|On one account, {{moments before}} his death, Beethoven was laying upon bed, pale and suffering, {{when a man}} entered. It was fellow {{composer}} Johann Nepomuk Hummel, who was Beethoven's old and only friend, {{and one of his}} contemporaries. Hummel, who had heard of Beethoven's illness, came to him with succor and money. But it was too late; Beethoven was speechless, and a grateful smile was all that he had to bestow upon his friend. Hummel bent toward him, and, by the aid of an acoustic instrument, enabled Beethoven to hear a few words of his compassion and regret. Beethoven seemed reanimated, his eyes shone, he struggled for utterance, and gasped, [...] "Is it not true, Hummel, that I have some talent after all?". After these words, his eyes grew fixed, his mouth fell <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> passed away.|$|E
2500|$|After Ortiz's {{scheduled}} rematch against Andre Berto {{fell through}} when Berto {{tested positive for}} a banned substance, his promotional team quickly found a late replacement in Josesito Lopez. However, {{just days before the}} fight was scheduled to take place, Ortiz was announced as the opponent for Saúl Álvarez in the main event of a Pay-Per-View show entitled [...] "Knockout Kings" [...] scheduled for September 15, 2012 if he were to defeat Lopez. Ortiz fought Lopez at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on June 23. In an exciting fight, both fighters repeatedly engaged in competitive exchanges, as opposed to the one-sided bout predicted by many members of the press. At the beginning of the tenth round, Ortiz's team threw in the towel when the fighter complained of a broken jaw, subsequently cancelling his possible bout with Alvarez. After the fight, Ortiz stated, [...] "Josesito broke my jaw, I had my mouth <b>open</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> broke my jaw. I couldn't close my mouth. It happened early in the (ninth) round. The corner wanted me to continue but I just couldn't." ...|$|E
