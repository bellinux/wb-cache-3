She also said she would contact them when she returned. At 2:05 pm she called a number which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The call lasted approximately five minutes. At 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend and left a voice message promising him they would talk later. This call ended after one minute.|$|E
5|$|Spence and Stilwell were arraigned on {{the robbery}} charges before Justice Wells Spicer, who set their bail at $7,000 each. They were {{released}} after paying their bail, but Spence and Stilwell were rearrested by Virgil for the Bisbee robbery a month later, on October 13, {{on the new}} federal charge of interfering with a mail carrier. The newspapers, however, {{reported that they had}} been arrested for a different stage robbery that occurred (October 8) near Contention City. Occurring less than two weeks before the O.K. Corral shootout, this final incident may have been misunderstood by the McLaurys. While Wyatt and Virgil were still <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>for</b> the Spence and Stilwell hearing, Frank McLaury confronted Morgan Earp, telling him that the McLaurys would kill the Earps if they tried to arrest Spence, Stilwell, or the McLaurys again.|$|E
25|$|Police {{investigations}} conducted {{years after}} Zach Ramsay went missing determined that Bar-Jonah {{had access to}} his mother's off-white, four-door 1978 Toyota Corolla the day Zach Ramsay disappeared, and that his mother and brother were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>for</b> a funeral. It was moreover determined that Bar-Jonah did not work on February 6 of 1996, nor on the days immediately preceding.|$|E

25|$|Residents {{were set}} to {{celebrate}} their country's World War I victory over Austria on 4 November, Armed Forces Day. In commemoration, businesses were closed {{and many of their}} employees were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>for</b> the public holiday. While many lives were likely spared as a result, the locked buildings greatly inhibited the salvaging of valuable materials from numerous institutions and shops, {{with the exception of a}} number of jewellery stores whose owners were warned by their nightwatchmen.|$|E
25|$|Hardin {{claimed that}} in a saloon on {{election}} night in November 1876, he and a companion, Jacksonville policeman Gus Kennedy, {{were involved in a}} gunfight with Mobile policemen in which one person was wounded and two killed. He further claims that he and Kennedy were arrested and later released. This appears to be another case of an exaggerated encounter. Hardin and Kennedy were simply arrested and driven <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>for</b> cheating at cards. Again Hardin's version does not fit with contemporary records.|$|E
25|$|To ensure Mirabel's survival, all {{international}} flights for Montreal {{were banned}} from Dorval from 1975 to 1997. However, public pressure {{in support of}} Dorval prevented its planned closure. As a result, Dorval's continued existence made Mirabel comparatively expensive and unattractive to airlines and travellers alike. While Dorval was only 20 minutes {{away from the city}} core, it took 50 minutes to get to Mirabel even in ideal traffic conditions. Passengers who used Montreal in transit had to take long bus rides for connections from domestic to international flights, and Montrealers grew to resent Mirabel as they were forced to travel far <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>for</b> international flights.|$|E

25|$|Hargreaves {{had worked}} with Steve Wade on How before Southern Television lost its franchise. In 1985 Hargreaves worked with Wade to make twenty-seven new <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Town</b> episodes <b>for</b> video release.

25|$|Now that they've quit Wellman Plastics, Roseanne and Jackie {{must find}} new jobs. Jackie decides {{to become a}} police officer. Roseanne cycles {{through a variety of}} menial jobs {{including}} telemarketer, secretary for Dan's boss, bartender, cashier at a fast-food restaurant, and, finally, sweeping floors at a beauty parlor. At home, Dan's poker buddy Arnie (Tom Arnold) makes a startling debut when he plants a passionate kiss on Roseanne. The Conners celebrate an outrageous Halloween that becomes an annual feature of the series. Roseanne wants 10 minutes to herself in the bathroom; this turns into a bizarre dream sequence which has the entire cast singing parodies of songs from musical comedies. Later, at Thanksgiving dinner, Dan takes wary notice of a growing romance between his father and Crystal. Jackie gets serious with new boyfriend Gary (Brian Kerwin). Becky repeatedly rebels against Roseanne and Dan's parental authority such as staying out late and breaking into the liquor cabinet with her friend Dana and getting drunk when Dan and Roseanne are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>for</b> the day. The reappearance of old biker buddy Ziggy (Jay O. Sanders) reminds Roseanne and Dan of their own rebellious past. Darlene first proves her talent for writing when she wins recognition for her poetry. Roseanne's own writing talents are given a boost when her family fixes up a basement room to serve as a writer's den. This is the first season where we hear Roseanne thinking out loud.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Kenny {{suffers from}} a bout of [...] "explosive diarrhea", which spreads {{to others in the}} town, {{including}} the adults protesting Terrance and Phillip. Despite objecting to the show, the adults themselves laugh and make jokes at their own real-life toilet humor. Carol proclaims that if Cartoon Central does not take the show off the air, the protesters will kill themselves, and they start using a slingshot to send themselves flying into the building. With the adults <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>for</b> the protest, the boys are free to watch Terrance and Phillip at their leisure. Grandpa Marvin continues asking Stan to kill him, and demonstrates how terrible his life is by locking Stan in a room and forcing him to listen to a song in the style of Enya's [...] "Orinoco Flow". Now convinced that his life is excruciating, Stan finally agrees to kill his grandpa, and tries to do so by rigging a cow on a pulley and dropping it on him. Just as the boys are about to do it, Death himself arrives, but starts chasing after the boys instead of Grandpa Marvin.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{credited}} as Phylicia Ayers-Allen, Rashad eventually {{adopted the}} surname of her third husband, sportscaster Ahmad Rashad, who she married during the show's third season. During the wedding ceremony, Rashad was [...] "given away" [...] to Ahmad by television husband Cosby, by whom {{the couple had}} first been introduced. Cosby assured Rashad {{that she would be}} allowed to remain on the show should she and Ahmad decide to have a baby, joking, [...] "We'll just add another Huxtable". Rashad became pregnant with their child during season three. To avoid having to add an infant to the main cast, extreme tactics were used to conceal the actress' pregnancy onscreen, such as confining Clair to bed or having her be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>for</b> several episodes at a time. Scooped out, the bed's mattress was specially constructed to prevent Rashad's growing stomach from being visible underneath the covers but ultimately resulted in the actress suffering a pinched nerve in her back. Rashad would also hide behind props such as kitchen tables, counters and jackets. In the episode [...] "Vanessa's Rich", Rashad uses a large teddy bear to hide her pregnancy while seated on the living room sofa, but the toy's origin and purpose within the episode remains unexplained. After giving birth to daughter Condola Rashad in 1986, Rashad managed to lose the weight she had gained while pregnant by the time season four premiered. Rashad's sister, actress Debbie Allen, appeared in an episode of The Cosby Show as Clair's personal trainer.|$|E

500|$|Residents of the company-owned {{houses were}} given the option to buy the {{structures}} at bargain prices, provided they move them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> <b>For</b> many, it took a great chunk of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after it became official that Elcor's fate was sealed, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at $75 were now being sold {{for as much as}} $500. Most of the remaining families moved a mile west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed. All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135 between Gilbert and Biwabik. A rusted fire hydrant adorned what was once a street corner, and a porcelain toilet bowl remained bolted to a concrete floor. An abandoned rail line for the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway went through {{what was left of the}} town site. Mine shafts were boarded up with old timbers. After everyone had left, the company dumped heaps of iron ore on the roads leading into Elcor, and in the process a ghost town was made out of what was once a thriving community.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial began}} in June 1934 before Justice William Ives with {{three days of}} {{testimony}} from MacMillan. [...] Brownlee's lawyer, Arthur LeRoy Smith, used his cross examination {{to call into question}} almost everything MacMillan said. [...] To refute her claim that Brownlee had convinced her to move to Edmonton, he entered into evidence a letter she had written to Alberta College seeking information on its programs, dated before she had even met Brownlee. [...] He further demonstrated that on the evening of the seduction, which had allegedly taken place in a car on a side road west of Edmonton, the city had been engulfed in a blizzard. [...] Moreover, the government car in which the seduction was supposed to have taken place had not been purchased until {{more than a year after}} that date. [...] In response to her testimony that she had always slept in the maid's room while staying with the Brownlees, Smith produced letters showing that she had actually slept in Mrs. Brownlee's room. [...] After MacMillan conceded her mistake, Smith noted that Mrs. Brownlee's room had a large deadbolt on the door: if she had feared Brownlee, why had she not used it? [...] "Because I just did as Mr. Brownlee said," [...] was the plaintiff's response. [...] MacMillan, when questioned, admitted that the period during which she had been staying in the Brownlee home in the spring of 1932, which she had initially placed at six weeks, was actually only four. [...] When she identified these four weeks as the last two weeks of April and the first two of May, Smith showed that Brownlee had been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>for</b> all but ten nights of that period.|$|E

2500|$|He {{accompanied}} William Walker on the latter's 1855 filibustering {{expedition to}} Nicaragua. In {{the spring of}} 1857, Miller took part in an expedition against the Pit River Tribe after they killed a white man on Pit River. Years later, he claimed that he had sided with the Native Americans and was run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> <b>for</b> it. He was widely rumored to have married an Indian woman, possibly a Wintu princess who nursed him back to health after he was wounded by Modocs, and to have fathered with her a daughter named Cali-Shasta, or [...] "Lily of the Shasta." [...] Although Miller soon left the area to pursue other adventures, in the 1870s he sought out Cali-Shasta, then in her teens, and took her to San Francisco to be educated by his friend Ina Coolbrith. Contemporaries believed that Miller's [...] "Indian wife" [...] was the woman later kidnapped by Modocs and held in captivity for some years until rescued {{by a man named}} Jim Brock (whom she married), but when [...] "Amanda Brock" [...] died in 1909, Miller denied news reports describing his supposed romance with her.
