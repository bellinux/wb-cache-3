However, bacteria develop resistance and coatings are often not uniform and not stable in time. The challenge is finding an antibacterial coating that is biocompatible, cost-effective, not toxic, and spreadable over large and irregular surfaces. Here we demonstrate an antibacterial cloak by laser printing of graphene oxide hydrogels mimicking the Cancer Pagurus carapace. We observe up to 90 % reduction of bacteria cells.

A key ingredient of this technological dominance has been the rapid advances in the quality and processing of materials-semiconductors, conductors and insulators-thus providing the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor device technology with its important characteristics of negligible standby power dissipation, good input-output isolation, surface potential control and reliable operation.

Recent studies have unveiled degraded {{dielectric breakdown voltage}} (DBV) performance of the ultra-thin oxides. These findings suggest that one source for poor <b>oxide</b> <b>integrity</b> is the incorporation of native defects from the Si substrate during oxide growth. Primary defect candidates are D defects which exist mostly in the central region of floating zone (FZ) grown Si crystals. Nitrogen (N) doping eliminates D defects, as detected by conventional means, and improves <b>oxide</b> <b>integrity.</b> Results are presented indicating the prevalence of microdefects in the central region of p-type nitrogen doped FZ Si using the method of Li ion (Li{sup +}) drifting in an electric field.

40|$|Some defects on {{the surface}} of carbon steel {{do not need to be}} removed before hot rolling because the surface will be vigorously {{oxidised}} in a reheating environment. Thus the defects can be minimised by oxidising and then removed by the de-scaling process. The defects {{on the surface}} of ferritic stainless steels, however, are not easily removed by oxidation when a high chromium concentration is used. In this paper, a ferritic stainless steel grade 445 was selected as a research material. The effects of different surface features on oxidation and tribological behaviour in the hot rolling process were investigated. Three surface states were prepared, namely, smooth surface, surface with 45 ° grinding marks and surface with oscillation marks. The samples were put into an electric furnace at 1100 °C for reheating. Hot rolling tests were carried out on a 2 -high Hille 100 experimental rolling mill. Rolling forces were measured, and the coefficient of friction was calculated and compared under various rolling parameters. It was found that the original surface profiles with grinding marks were still maintained during oxidation. The original oxide scale on the surface with oscillation marks caused the formation of irregular oxide nodules and the spallation of the oxide scale.

This General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) is fabricated using iridium clad vent sets to contain the plutonium <b>oxide</b> fuel pellets. <b>Integrity</b> of the closure weld is essential to ensure containment of the plutonium. The Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant took the lead role in developing the ultrasonic inspection for the closure weld and transferring the inspection to Los Alamos National Laboratory for use in fueled clad inspection for the Cassini mission. Initially only amplitude and time-of-flight data were recorded. However, a number of benign geometric conditions produced signals that were larger than the acceptance threshold. To identify these conditions, a B-scan inspection was developed that acquired full ultrasonic waveforms. Using a test protocol the B-scan inspection was able to identify benign conditions such as weld shield fusion and internal mismatch. Tangential radiography was used to confirm the ultrasonic results.

40|$|The structural, {{mechanical}} and gas barrier properties of aluminum oxide and {{indium tin oxide}} coatings deposited by DC reactive sputtering on poly(ethylene terephthalate) has been investigated. The oxygen and water vapour transmission rates of the films were measured {{as a function of}} temperature in order to assess the effectiveness of the oxides as gas barriers. Both types of composites exhibited good resistance to water vapour transmission. However, the indium tin oxide coating was significantly more effective as a gas barrier than the conventional aluminum <b>oxide.</b> The microstructural <b>integrity</b> of the <b>oxide</b> coatings was examined using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy.

Kinetic data were acquired and the parabolic rate constant for oxidation was determined and compared with literature data on various SiC materials. The role of secondary phases on the oxide morphology was explored. ABC-SiC {{was compared to}} commercially available SiC, Hexoloy, and SiC sintered with 10 % yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG). Two-step sintering (pre-coarsening) was employed with holds for 48 hours at 600 [...] 1, 600 C, prior to the typical hot-pressing conditions of 1, 900 C for 1 hour, to change the chemistry and {{reduce the number of}} bubbles in the silica scale.

40|$|Contamination {{of silicon}} with trace amounts of copper during {{processing}} can adversely affect the gate <b>oxide</b> <b>integrity</b> of integrated circuits, resulting in substantial yield loss and reliability problems. Because of {{increased use of}} copper as interconnect material, cross-contamination during the production process must be avoided. Establishing adequate protocols for wafer handling and tool use requires understanding of the mechanisms by which copper affects the gate oxide and knowledge of acceptable contamination limits. The effect of copper contamination on thin gate <b>oxide</b> <b>integrity</b> was studied by purposely introducing small amounts of copper in controlled contamination experiments. Copper contamination causes gate oxide defects by precipitating near the Si/SiO₂ interface when the silicon is cooled from the processing temperature. The concentration at which defects start to appear on flat capacitors decreases with decreasing oxide thickness. When copper contamination from a contaminated ammonium hydroxide peroxide mixture cleaning solution occurs, deposition of more than 7 x 10 ¹⁰ atoms/cm² is required before the gate <b>oxide</b> <b>integrity</b> of 3 nm oxides is affected. Such levels are not readily exceeded in {{state of the art}} integrated circuit fabrication facilities using high-grade chemicals. Copper deposition from contaminated hydrofluoric acid (HF) solutions results in oxide lifetime degradation for 3 nm oxides even when less than 1 x 10 ¹⁰ atoms/cm² is deposited. The copper catalyzes hydrogen evolution, which in turn causes dissolution, and thus roughening, of the silicon surface. Roughening of the silicon is responsible for the reduced oxide quality. Thus, removal of the copper after contamination has occurred does not lead to recovery of the oxide quality. A copper contaminated silicon surface, which is immersed in uncontaminated HF, will also have reduced oxide lifetime. Precipitation occurs more readily at field overlap regions, since these regions have a large amount of mechanical stress, which getters contaminants and allows precipitates to nucleate and grow more easily. Field overlap precipitates result in a large field overlap-related defect density when copper contamination occurs. Copper contamination from contaminated HF also results in bumps in an oxide that is subsequently grown on the surface. These local regions of thicker oxide can lead to threshold voltage non-uniformity...|$|E
