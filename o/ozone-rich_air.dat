This altitude variation of ozone results from the slow circulation that lifts the ozone-poor {{air out of the}} troposphere into the stratosphere. As this air slowly rises in the tropics, ozone is produced as the sun overhead photolyzes oxygen molecules. As this slow circulation levels off and flows towards the mid-latitudes, it carries the <b>ozone-rich</b> <b>air</b> from the tropical middle stratosphere to the lower stratosphere middle and high latitudes [...] The high ozone concentrations at high latitudes are due to the accumulation of ozone at lower altitudes.|$|E

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{analysis of}} zonally averaged, ozone concentration {{data obtained from}} commercial (GASP) aircraft between the equator and 60 deg North indicates that ozone in the upper troposphere exhibits a primary maximum during the spring, and, in middle latitudes, a secondary maximum {{in the summer of}} both 1975 and 1976.

The April ozone maximum has been well documented and appears at the time when the stratospheric ozone content is greatest and cyclogenetic activity is most vigorous. However, the secondary maximum in June has not been widely observed or quoted as a unique feature. It is hypothesized that the rapid ascent of the tropopause between midspring and summer could account for the incorporation of <b>ozone-rich,</b> stratospheric <b>air</b> into the upper troposphere with a subsequent dilution during the following months.

The EOF 1 mode, which explained 61. 5 % of the total variance, showed a same-sign distribution over all of East Asia, with a belt of enhanced ozone concentrations around 40 °N. The principal component of EOF 1 (PC 1) suggested that photochemical ozone production together with Brewer-Dobson circulation and subtropical westerly jet plays important roles in modulating the seasonal variation of the TOVMR; <b>ozone-rich</b> <b>air</b> produced by photochemical processes was transported from the stratosphere to the troposphere by BD circulation and this <b>ozone-rich</b> <b>air</b> was then blocked by the subtropical westerly jet and accumulated north of the jet.

The cause of the ozone enhancement was studied utilizing synoptic meteorology diagnosis from conventional weather data, the National Centers for Environmental Protection data, the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer data, Brewer data, and Geostationary Meteorological Satellite images of the water vapor channel. It was revealed that the observed secondary ozone peaks in the upper troposphere in this event were associated with a remarkable intrusion of the stratospheric air downward into the troposphere.

40|$|We analyze {{horizontal}} transport from midlatitudes into the tropics (in-mixing) {{and its impact}} on seasonal variations of ozone, carbon monoxide and water vapor in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL). For this purpose, we use three-dimensional backward trajectories, driven by ECMWF ERA-Interim winds, and a conceptual one-dimensional model of the chemical composition of the TTL. We find that the fraction of in-mixed midlatitude air shows an annual cycle with maximum during NH summer, resulting from the superposition of two inversely phased annual cycles for in-mixing from the NH and SH, respectively. In-mixing is driven by the monsoonal upper-level anticyclonic circulations. This circulation pattern is dominated by the Southeast Asian summer monsoon and, correspondingly, in-mixing shows an annual cycle. The impact of in-mixing on TTL mixing ratios depends on the in-mixed fraction of midlatitude air and on the meridional gradient of the particular species. For CO the meridional gradient and consequently the effect of in-mixing is weak. For water vapor, in-mixing effects are negligible. For ozone, the meridional gradient is large and the contribution of in-mixing to the ozone maximum during NH summer is about 50 %. This in-mixing contribution is not sensitive to the tropical ascent velocity, which is about 40 % too fast in ERA-Interim. As photochemically produced ozone in the TTL shows no distinct summer maximum, the ozone annual anomaly in the upper TTL turns out to be mainly forced by in-mixing of <b>ozone-rich</b> extratropical <b>air</b> during NH summer...|$|R

40|$|The Mediterranean basin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{sensitive}} regions in the world regarding climate change and air quality. This is partly due to the singular dynamical situation of the Mediterranean basin that leads to tropospheric-ozone concentrations that are among the highest over the Northern Hemisphere. Six years of summertime tropospheric ozone observed by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instrument from 2007 to 2012 have been analysed to document the variability of ozone over this region. The satellite observations have been examined together with meteorological analyses (from ECMWF) to understand the processes driving this variability. Our work confirmed the presence of a steep west–east ozone gradient in the lower troposphere with the highest concentrations observed over the eastern part of the Mediterranean basin. This gradient is mainly explained by diabatic convection over the Persian Gulf during the Indian monsoon season, which induces an important subsidence of <b>ozone-rich</b> <b>air</b> masses from the upper to the lower troposphere over the central and the eastern Mediterranean basin. IASI observations of ozone concentrations at a 3 km height show a clear summertime maximum in July that is well correlated to the maximum of downward transport of <b>ozone-rich</b> <b>air</b> masses from the upper troposphere. Even if this feature is robust over the six analysed years, we have also investigated monthly ozone anomalies – one positive (June 2008) and one negative (June and July 2009) – using daily IASI observations.

40|$|Abstract. A middle-latitude cyclone {{occurring}} {{during the}} Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry near the Equator-Atlantic (TRACE A) experiment is examined {{to determine its}} influence on distributions of tropospheric ozone over the South Atlantic Ocean. A maximum of tropospheric ozone {{is located in the}} vicinity of this cyclone on October 3, 1992. Flight level data and meteorological analyses indicate a downward protrusion of dry, <b>ozone-rich</b> stratospheric <b>air</b> near the cyclone, i. e., a tropopause fold. Backward trajectories show that air parcels arriving in the upper troposphere of the cyclone originate in the stratosphere. Forward trajectories are calculated from these locations having stratospheric histories. They indicate that some air is transported as far north as 22 øS, subsiding into the middle troposphere along the southern fringes of a region of enhanced tropospheric ozone that is located west of Africa on October 6. Backward trajectories then are computed along the Greenwich meridian over much of the South Atlantic Ocean. This axis passes through the tropospheric ozone maximum west of Africa and the region of strong horizontal ozone gradients along its southern border. Results indicate that most air parcels arriving north of 20 øS (in the ozone-rich region) originate over Africa. Conversely, most parcels arriving south of 20 øS (where there is less ozone) originate from the west, passing over the southern half of South America. Thus the tropospheric ozone maximum west of Africa on October 6 appears to be attributable to outflow from Africa, with stratospheric transport being much less important. Formerly stratospheric air near the cyclone on October 3 also is transported forward into the middle troposphere near Madagascar where there is a second maximum of tropospheric ozone on October 6. Backward trajectories from this region indicate that middle-latitude systems exert a much greater influence here than over the South Atlantic. This area experiences relatively little outflow from Africa during our period of study. 1...|$|R

Statistics on the amplitude and longitudinal position of zonal anomalies are obtained from the distribution of total ozone along seven individual latitudes at 5 -degree intervals between 50 &deg; S and 80 &deg; S. As shown by the September-November means, the mid-latitude collar of <b>ozone-rich</b> stratospheric <b>air</b> has a sub-Antarctic maximum with a mean location in the quadrant 90 &deg; E&ndash; 180 &deg; E and a total ozone level of about 380 DU between 50 &deg; S and 60 &deg; S. The steady displacement and elongation of the ozone hole {{under the influence of}} planetary waves causes a zonal anomaly of low ozone in the sector 0 &deg;&ndash; 60 &deg; W with total ozone levels of about 200 DU between 70 &deg; S and 80 &deg; S. Climatologically, the highest amplitude of the zonal anomaly is 57. 2 &plusmn; 13. 5 DU (relative asymmetry of 32 % between high and low ozone levels) at 65 &deg; S latitude. A significant eastward shift of approximately 45 &deg; in longitude is observed in the total ozone minimum over the Weddell Sea &ndash; South Atlantic sector during 1979 &ndash; 2005, whereas the zonal maximum is relatively stable in location. Also apparent is a long-term shift in tropopause temperature distribution in the region. The geographical distribution of the zonal extremes in total ozone for the seven latitudes shows that (i) the extremes exhibit sensitivity to the shape of the Antarctic continent, (ii) the stationarity of the extremes increases poleward above the edge of continent and (iii) the positions of the extremes at the higher latitudes tend to follow the meridionally oriented elements of orography. It is suggested that the radiative influence of Antarctica contributes to the formation of this pattern. Anomalies in the horizontal structure of the tropopause, which appear related to orography, support this view. Mechanisms involved in the formation and decadal change in the total ozone asymmetry, as well as possible influences of the asymmetry on the stratospheric thermal regimes and regional UV irradiance redistribution are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Mesoscale {{processes}} (atmospheric phenomena with horizontal scales {{ranging from}} a few tens to several hundred kilometres and lasting from a few tens of minutes to a few days) {{have the potential to}} influence the chemical composition of the troposphere. Tropopause folds and mountain waves are two important types of mesoscale processes. Concentrations and gradients of trace gases like ozone (O 3) can be influenced by these processes. Tropopause folds bring <b>ozone-rich</b> stratospheric <b>air</b> to lower altitudes. Mountain waves and turbulence associated with them influence O 3 gradients in the troposphere. Tropospheric O 3 is a toxic pollutant and a short-lived greenhouse gas with an influence on the lifetime of many other trace gases. Understanding of its long-term development and budgets are important. For this, better understanding, generalization and representation of mesoscale processes are necessary. Observations made by the 52 MHz wind-profiler radar ESRAD (ESrange RADar) and the 54. 5 MHz wind-profiler radar MARA (Movable Atmospheric Radar for Antarctica) served as the basis for this study. ESRAD is located close to Kiruna in arctic Sweden and has been in operation since July 1996. This is a site with frequent mountain wave activity. By analysis of ESRAD and sonde data we have studied vertical mixing and turbulence associated with mountain waves. An attempt was made to show the influence of these processes on relaxation of the O 3 gradient in the lower troposphere. Additional balloon-borne in situ measurements of vertical profiles of atmospheric characteristics (temperature, humidity, O 3 mixing ratio) complement the radar measurements and aid in correct identification and improved understanding of the observed processes {{as well as of the}} radar backscatter signal itself. MARA was operated at the Swedish summer station Wasa (73 °S, 13. 5 °W) during austral summer 2010 / 2011 and at the Norwegian year-round station Troll (72 °S, 2. 5 °E) nonstop since December 2011. During its operation at the Wasa station, ozonesonde measurements were successfully undertaken during the passage of a tropopause fold. These provided validity to the radar measurements and proved them to be a useful tool for tropopause fold studies, for the first time at Antarctic latitudes. Data gathered at the Troll station exhibit signs of an annual cycle of tropopause folds with winter maximum and summer minimum in their occurrence rate which is similar to the observed behaviour in the northern hemisphere. Comparisons with ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) model data and the WRF model (Advanced Research and Weather Forecasting) show that higher resolution models such as WRF are needed for more adequate representation of these processes. High resolution models can in return serve as a basis for studies of areas that are not at all or only partially covered by measurement networks, as well as for global studies. Thus they can provide useful information about atmospheric transport and the state of trace gases like O 3.

40|$|Convective {{redistribution}} of ozone and its precursors between the boundary layer (BL) {{and the free}} troposphere (FT) influences photochemistry, in particular {{in the middle and}} upper troposphere (UT). We present a case study of convective transport during the GABRIEL campaign over the tropical rain forest in Suriname in October 2005. During one measurement flight the inflow and outflow regions of a cumulonimbus cloud (Cb) have been characterized. We identified a distinct layer between 9 and 11 km altitude with enhanced mixing ratios of CO, O 3, HOx, acetone and acetonitrile. The elevated O 3 contradicts the expectation that convective transport brings low-ozone air from the boundary layer to the outflow region.

40|$|International audienceChanges of stratospheric {{dynamical}} {{structure and}} ozone are investigated in {{observations of the}} lower stratosphere, from meteorological analyses and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) ozone, and in contemporaneous observations of the upper stratosphere and mesosphere, from the French lidar at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP). Interannual changes in the lower stratosphere are shown {{to be accompanied by}} coherent changes in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere. Over the 1980 s and 1990 s, both operate coherently with anomalous forcing of the residual mean circulation. Changes of temperature and ozone at OHP have sign and structure consistent with interannual changes of meridional transport. They reflect a poleward expansion and contraction of warm <b>ozone-rich</b> <b>air,</b> compensated by opposite changes of the polar-night vortex...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the pattern of {{temperature}} trend with height in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere is consistent with that calculated from a model incorporating the observed ozone changes. The magnitude of the observed temperature decrease is less than that determined from the numerical model. It is found that the obverse ozone-temperature relationship does not hold. If the temperature at 20 km decreases, this by itself would result {{in an increase in}} the ozone values through the inverse temperature sensitivity of the chemical reactions. In the lower stratosphere a positive correlation between ozone and temperature tends to exist through the dynamics. <b>Ozone-rich</b> <b>air</b> moving downward undergoes an increase in temperature through adiabatic compression and vice-versa. That the temperature trends indicate no apparent variation with latitude suggests a nondynamic cause...|$|E
40|$|Monoterpenes emitted to {{air from}} two Swedish kraft (sulphate) pulp-mills were {{determined}} by sampling on the Tenax adsorbent followed by laboratory analysis using thermal desorption combined with high-resolution gas chromatography. The composition of the terpenes {{was found to be}} similar in the emissions from various parts of the process {{as well as in the}} mill plume. The bicyclic terpenes alpha-pinene and 3 -carene, originating principally from wood of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), predominated among the thirteen assessed hydrocarbon monoterpenes. Terpinolene was the most prominent among the particularly reactive terpenes with a lifetime in <b>ozone-rich</b> <b>air</b> of only a few minutes. The rapid formation of photooxidants by chemical reactions of the terpenes with other components of the mill plume is discussed. It is concluded that a variety of phytotoxic photooxidants are formed which may contribute significantly to forest decline within 50 km of mills located along coasts...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} NOAA’s Tunable Optical Profiler for Aerosol and oZone (TOPAZ) ozone lidar to {{investigate}} the sources of high surface ozone concentrations in two {{different regions of the}} western United States (US) : the Uintah Basin in northeast Utah and Clark County in southern Nevada, which includes the city of Las Vegas. The Uintah Basin is a booming oil and gas producing region that often suffers from very high wintertime ozone concentrations. Clark County experiences violations of the US ozone standard primarily in spring and early summer despite a lack of any major local pollution sources. TOPAZ lidar observations, in conjunction with surface in situ measurements and model results, provided strong evidence that the high wintertime ozone concentrations in the Uintah Basin are primarily driven by local emissions associated with oil and gas exploration, whereas the Clark County ozone exceedances are often caused by <b>ozone-rich</b> <b>air</b> that is transported from the lower stratosphere {{all the way down to}} the earth’s surface...|$|E
40|$|Africa, {{seasonal}} clearing of dry {{vegetation and}} other fire-related activities lead to intense smoke haze and ozone formation. The first ozone soundings {{in the heart}} of the southern African burning region were taken at Lusaka, Zambia (15. 5 S, 28 E) in early September 2000. Maximum surface ozone was over 90 ppbv and column tropospheric ozone exceeded 50 DU. These values are higher than concurrent measurements over Nairobi (1 S, 38 E) and Irene (25 S, 28 E, near Pretoria). At least 30 % of Lusaka surface ozone appears to be from local sources. A layer at 800 – 500 hPa has ozone> 120 ppbv and originates from trans-boundary recirculation. Starting out over Zambia, Angola, and Namibia, <b>ozone-rich</b> <b>air</b> travels east to the Indian Ocean, before heading back toward Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Zambia. Thus, Lusaka collects local and imported pollution, consistent with its location within the southern African gyre. INDEX TERMS: 0345 Atmospheri...|$|E
