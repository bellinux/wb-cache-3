5|$|Aletheia– The former Oracle of Delphi who was gifted with prophetic sight. When she was {{encountered}} by Kratos, she {{was shown to}} be an elderly woman who had no eyes. Castor and Pollux crushed her under rocks so that Kratos could not see her. Her dying words to Kratos told him to seek the Eyes of Truth across the sea in the Lantern of Delos—the Eyes being her <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> that were taken by the Furies. The character was voiced by Adrienne Barbeau in Ascension.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes faced {{competition}} for the Matabeleland mining concession from George Cawston and Lord Gifford, two London financiers. They appointed as their agent Edward Arthur Maund, who had served with Sir Charles Warren in Bechuanaland between 1884 and 1885, {{towards the end of}} this time visiting Lobengula as an official British envoy. Cawston and Gifford's base in England gave them the advantage of better connections with Whitehall, while Rhodes's location in the Cape allowed him to see the situation with his <b>own</b> <b>eyes.</b> He also possessed formidable financial capital and closer links with the relevant colonial administrators. In May 1888, Cawston and Gifford wrote to Lord Knutsford, the British Colonial Secretary, seeking his approval for their designs.|$|E

5|$|Rodin {{was born}} in 1840 into a working-class family in Paris, the second child of Marie Cheffer and Jean-Baptiste Rodin, who was a police {{department}} clerk. He was largely self-educated, and began to draw at age ten. Between ages 14 and 17, Rodin attended the Petite École, a school specializing in art and mathematics, where he studied drawing and painting. His drawing teacher, Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran, believed in first developing the personality of his students so that they observed with their <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> and drew from their recollections. Rodin still expressed appreciation for his teacher much later in life. It was at Petite École that he first met Jules Dalou and Alphonse Legros.|$|E
5|$|In December 1554, Ambrose and Robert Dudley {{took part}} in a tournament held to {{celebrate}} Anglo-Spanish friendship. Yet, the Dudley brothers were only welcome at court as long as King Philip was there, otherwise they were even suspected of associating with people who conspired against Mary's regime. In January 1557 Robert and Amy Dudley were allowed to repossess some of their former lands, and in March of the same year Dudley was at Calais where he was chosen to deliver personally to Queen Mary the happy news of Philip's return to England. Ambrose, Robert, and Henry Dudley, the youngest brother, fought for PhilipII at the Battle of St. Quentin in August 1557. Henry Dudley was killed in the following siege by a cannonball—according to Robert, before his <b>own</b> <b>eyes.</b> All surviving Dudley children—Ambrose and Robert with their sisters Mary and Katherine—were restored in blood by Mary I's next parliament in 1558.|$|E

50|$|Independent from Young, George Biddell Airy {{discovered}} {{the phenomenon of}} astigmatism on his <b>own</b> <b>eye.</b> Airy presented his observations on his <b>own</b> <b>eye</b> in February 1825 at the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Airy produced lenses to correct his vision problems by 1825, while other sources put this into 1827 when Airy obtained cylindrical lenses from an optician from Ipswich. The name for the condition was not given by Airy, but from William Whewell.|$|R

25|$|During the search, {{outside the}} mansion, Briony catches {{a glimpse of}} a man assaulting Lola. Lola could not say who {{attacked}} her, as her eyes were covered. In the ensuing investigation, Briony insists she saw Robbie as the assailant with her very <b>own</b> <b>eyes.</b> She looks for the indecent note Robbie had sent Cecilia, and shows it to back up her testimony. Robbie is arrested and imprisoned.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} {{evolved from}} a community mural workshop in which the participants designed and painted the portable mural “Masks of God, Soul of Man” for the Bernal Heights Library. The group signed the piece as Precita Eyes Muralists because the project was a collaborative effort. The name of the organization {{comes from the fact}} that most of the muralists were from Precita Valley. Precita is a diminutive form of the Spanish word ‘presa,’ which means dam; the word ‘Precita’ means little dam. The ‘Eyes’ in the name are what we perceive the visual world with, our <b>own</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

25|$|Pompous British {{newspaper}} magnate Lord Rawnsley (Robert Morley) forbids his would-be aviatrix daughter, ardent suffragette Patricia (Sarah Miles), from flying. Aviator Richard Mays (James Fox), a young {{army officer}} and (at least in his <b>own</b> <b>eyes)</b> Patricia's fiancé, conceives {{the idea of}} an air race from London to Paris to advance the cause of British aviation (and his career). With Patricia's support, he persuades Lord Rawnsley to sponsor the race as a publicity stunt for his newspaper. Rawnsley, who takes full credit for the idea, announces the event to the press, shocking everyone with the amount of the prize.|$|E
25|$|After his release, Abu Firas was {{restored}} to {{his position and}} was named governor of Homs, but the situation was rapidly changing: {{less than a year}} after his release, Sayf al-Dawla died, and the Hamdanid emirate of Aleppo began to crumble. Abu Firas quickly quarrelled with Sayf al-Dawla's 15-year-old heir, Abu'l-Ma'ali, the son of Abu Firas' own sister, Sakhinah. Overestimating the support he enjoyed among the Arab tribes, Abu Firas revolted against his nephew, but was defeated and killed on 4 April 968 by Abu'l-Ma'ali's general Karghawayh. At the news of his death, Sakhinah was reportedly so overcome with grief, that she plucked out one of her <b>own</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
25|$|John Cutting Berry, another missionary of the American Board, {{directed}} {{not only}} the International Hospital of Kobe but also Kobe Hospital, and was energetic in his medical practice in Kobe, Himeji, and Sanda. In January 1873, Berry conducted the first human dissection in the prefecture at Kobe Hospital. He visited Kobe's prison in 1877, on the prefecture's request, {{in response to an}} outbreak of beriberi within, and saw with his <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> the unsanitary conditions and inhumane treatment of prisoners there. He pushed the prefecture to reform its prison system, and many other missionaries followed him in visiting the prisons and presenting plans to the government for their reform.|$|E

50|$|The {{previous}} verse {{introduced the}} metaphor of {{a person with a}} plank in their <b>own</b> <b>eye</b> who criticizes someone for a speck in their <b>own</b> <b>eye.</b> This extends the metaphor, showing how ridiculous a person with a plank would appear helping someone with simply a speck. Such aid is impossible, and its offer is ridiculous and condescending. Fowler sees this verse as stating that those with major flaws should keep quiet about the flaws of others until their own are dealt with. He links this to {{the metaphor of}} the blind leading the blind, if you follow one who cannot see you will simply follow the blind one into disaster.|$|R
25|$|Prior to {{the start}} of Oedipus Rex, Oedipus has become the king of Thebes while unwittingly {{fulfilling}} a prophecy that he would kill his father, Laius (the previous king), and marry his mother, Jocasta (whom Oedipus took as his queen after solving the riddle of the Sphinx). The action of Sophocles' play concerns Oedipus' search for the murderer of Laius in order to end a plague ravaging Thebes, unaware that the killer he is looking for is none other than himself. At the end of the play, after the truth finally comes to light, Jocasta hangs herself while Oedipus, horrified at his patricide and incest, proceeds to gouge out his <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> in despair.|$|E
25|$|As an {{initiation}} new recruits, especially forced ones, will {{be encouraged}} or forced {{to participate in}} atrocities, such as torture, rape and murder, unwilling recruits {{will be forced to}} do this against their own communities and families or be killed themselves. The goal of these atrocities is to divorce the new recruit from his or her previous life and bind them to the insurgency; criminals in their <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> and in the eyes of society, such recruits will be led to believe that they cannot go back to their previous lives and have no other family other than the insurgency. In order to break the hold the insurgency may hold over such members, the authorities may offer amnesties and pardons for crimes committed.|$|E
25|$|The Free Church of Scotland was a Scottish {{denomination}} {{which was}} formed in 1843 by a large withdrawal from the established Church of Scotland in a schism or division known as the Disruption of 1843. In 1900 {{the vast majority of}} the Free Church of Scotland joined with the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland to form the United Free Church of Scotland (which itself mostly re-united with the Church of Scotland in 1929). The House of Lords judged that the minority continuing after the 1900 union were entitled to all the assets. While the denomination clearly had a starting date, in their <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> their leaders had a legitimate claim to an unbroken succession of leaders going all the way back to the Apostles.|$|E

50|$|In the analogy, the one {{seeking to}} remove the {{impediment}} {{in the eye of}} his brother has the larger impediment in his <b>own</b> <b>eye,</b> suggesting metaphorically that the one who attempts to regulate his brother often displays the greater blindness and hypocrisy.|$|R
