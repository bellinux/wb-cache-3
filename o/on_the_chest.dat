5|$|England players {{traditionally}} wear a {{white shirt}} with a Rose embroidered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest,</b> white shorts, and navy blue socks with a white trim.|$|E
5|$|A. r. boucardi was {{described}} by Philip Sclater in 1867, and it is found in eastern Mexico from southern Coahuila to San Luis Potosí, northern Puebla, and southern Oaxaca. This subspecies is darker than A. r. eremoeca and has dull brown, not rufous, streaking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E
5|$|El Salvador's {{traditional}} first kit colour is {{blue with}} white trim, their second kit being white with blue trim. The current {{home and away}} kit features the traditional colours {{with the exception of}} bold curved trims that run {{from the center of the}} neck and open to the sides, forming two panels <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> that contain the Umbro logo and emblem of the Salvadoran Football Federation. At the center of the kit the Salvadoran national emblem, once again, is shown. The right sleeve shows the national flag.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{territorial}} behaviour of caecilians, but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges. These are usually feeding, breeding or sheltering sites. Males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species, females and even juveniles are also involved. Although in many frog species, females are larger than males, {{this is not the}} case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence. Some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest,</b> arms or thumbs.|$|E
5|$|Marsh {{and then}} Hatcher {{assumed that the}} animal was aquatic, because of the {{position}} of its nasal openings at the apex of the cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils {{when the rest of the}} body was submerged, as the water pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{noticeable}} features {{is their}} golden liver-coloured coat which {{is unique to}} the breed. Historically however, {{there have also been}} examples of both black and sandy coloured Sussex Spaniels. The coat is thick (sometimes with a slight wave to it), feathering <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest,</b> legs and ears and consists of a weather-resistant undercoat with a silky outer coat. The eyes are hazel in colour. The silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.|$|E
50|$|Commander: {{wears the}} badge of <b>the</b> order <b>on</b> a necklet, or on a bow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>chest</b> for ladies, and the plaque in silver <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>chest.</b>|$|R
50|$|Officer: {{wears the}} badge of <b>the</b> order <b>on</b> a ribbon <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>chest</b> with a rosette, or on a bow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>chest</b> with rosette for ladies.|$|R
50|$|Grand Officer: {{wears the}} badge of <b>the</b> order <b>on</b> a necklet, or on a bow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>chest</b> for ladies, and the plaque in gold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>chest.</b>|$|R
5|$|Seborrheic-like {{psoriasis}} is {{a common}} form of psoriasis with clinical aspects of psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis, {{and it may be}} difficult to distinguish from the latter. This form of psoriasis typically manifests as red plaques with greasy scales in areas of higher sebum production such as the scalp, forehead, skin folds next to the nose, skin surrounding the mouth, skin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> above the sternum, and in skin folds.|$|E
5|$|The female {{has four}} pairs of teats, {{including}} one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> and {{three on the}} belly, and the gall bladder is absent, both important characters of Oryzomyini. As is characteristic of Sigmodontinae, Pseudoryzomys has a complex penis, with the baculum (penis bone) displaying large protuberances at the sides. In the cartilaginous part of the baculum, the central digit is smaller than those at the sides.|$|E
5|$|The grocery-store chain ICA had {{sponsored}} IFK Göteborg since 1974, {{and their}} logo was displayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> of the shirt 1980–2010, leading some {{to consider it}} {{an integral part of}} the shirt. The ICA logo was reproduced in its original red colour for the first few years, but was then changed to a blue-and-white version to better blend with the kit colours.|$|E
50|$|The roof {{is made of}} cast {{aluminum}} and is topped by two 12 ft high sphinx-like structures with the fleur-de-lis of St. Louis adorned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chests.</b> These sphinx-like creatures were sculpted by Cleveland sculptor, Steven A. Rebeck.|$|R
50|$|The {{star of the}} 1st and 2nd classes {{was similar}} to the badge as {{described}} above, but with both red and yellow enameled rays. It was worn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>chest</b> by <b>the</b> 1st class, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right <b>chest</b> by <b>the</b> 2nd class.|$|R
50|$|The medal is worn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>chest.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{types of}} prisoners were {{distinguishable}} by triangular pieces of cloth, called Winkel, sewn onto on their jackets below their prisoner number. Political prisoners had a red triangle, Jehovah's Witnesses had purple, criminals had green, and so on. The nationality of the inmate was indicated by a letter stitched onto the Winkel. Jews had a yellow triangle, overlaid {{by a second}} Winkel if they also fit into a second category. Uniquely at Auschwitz, prisoners were tattooed with their prisoner number, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> for Soviet prisoners of war and on the left arm for civilians.|$|E
5|$|Their fur is {{darker than}} other spaniels {{and they have}} no {{undercoat}} like most of the other field type spaniels. Their coats come mostly in solid colours with some occasional markings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest.</b> They can make good family dogs and are patient with children, but can require some sort of purpose, be it hunting or agility work in order to prevent them from becoming bored and destructive.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no sexual}} dimorphism. Juveniles {{are very similar}} to adults, but the streaks on the mantle are blue rather than white. The primary coverts of juveniles are also more closely lined with blue, and the underparts are paler overall, {{especially}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest.</b> Adults perform a complete moult after the breeding season, whereas juveniles only have a partial moult, in which they replace a variable number of rectrices.|$|E
50|$|The {{star for}} the Grand Cordon and Second Class is a silver star of eight points, each point having three {{alternating}} silver rays; the central emblem {{is identical to}} the badge. It is worn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>chest</b> for <b>the</b> Grand Cordon, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right <b>chest</b> for <b>the</b> 2nd Class.|$|R
25|$|Bronze Medal, {{who wears}} <b>the</b> medal <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>chest.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Eagle, Globe, and Anchor {{embroidered}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>chest</b> pocket ...|$|R
5|$|They have a {{moderately}} long single coat with no undercoat. Feathering of the fur appears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest,</b> belly, ears {{and on the}} back of the legs. The coat is not as heavy as that of a Cocker Spaniel but will require grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in the fur. Docked tails were often used in working dogs, as poor blood flow left healing of the non docked tail difficult.|$|E
5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The hair is medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some waviness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> and otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> and red stripes going down the sides of the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a woman}} {{dance that}} is danced without music, only by the rhythm of <b>the</b> coins <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> woman costumes. The dancers are holding belts with the left over the right arm and begin their dance in a {{position}} of a half circle. The dance rhythm is 2/4.|$|R

50|$|Both medals {{are worn}} on a ribbon <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>chest.</b>|$|R
5|$|As the {{breakdown}} happens, the soldiers bind {{her on the}} chair but she laughs, kicks and spits on them. Midst the aggressive fighting, the white Madonna takes a speargun and shoots the black Madonna squarely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest.</b> The black Madonna falls down and concurrently a soldier pulls the switch on the electric chair. They laugh loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears, they see that no remnants are to be found. They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters (לאו) being burnt in the chair. They scratch their head and see {{a vision of a}} bearded man laughing at them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.|$|E
5|$|Between 1998–2001, Melbourne was {{the only}} club to display player names {{on the back of}} jerseys. This was because there was no major sponsor for the Storm to display <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> or back at the time and in {{addition}} it helped supporters new to the game identify the players. In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco, and was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players names on the back until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the player's names and displayed Adecco's logo on the back. Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{struggled}} {{to put a}} flowing move together in the opening exchanges, but it was United who had the better chances, both falling to Ronaldo. The first came in the seventhminute: having been played the ball by Michael Carrick, Ronaldo turned away from Piqué {{on the edge of}} the centre circle, before hitting a shot just wide from almost 40yards; the second saw the ball break to Ronaldo after Anderson and Patrice Evra had linked up well down the left flank. The Portuguese winger controlled the ball <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> before hitting the ball just past the far post.|$|E
