5|$|The {{amount of}} {{americium}} {{in a typical}} new smoke detector is 1microcurie (37kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm.

In large open areas such as atria and auditoriums, optical beam or projected-beam smoke detectors are used instead of a chamber within the unit: a wall-mounted unit emits a beam of infrared or ultraviolet light which is either received and processed by a separate device, or reflected back to the receiver by a reflector. In some types, particularly optical beam types, the light emitted by the light source passes through the air being tested and reaches the photosensor. The received light intensity will be reduced by absorption due to smoke, air-borne dust, or other substances; the circuitry detects the light intensity and generates the alarm if it is below a specified threshold, potentially due to smoke.

50|$|Americium-241 is {{the only}} {{synthetic}} isotope to have {{found its way into}} the household, where {{the most common type of}} smoke detector (the ionization-type) uses 241AmO2 (americium-241 dioxide) as its source of ionizing radiation. This isotope is preferred over 226Ra as 241Am emits 5 times more alpha particles and also emits relatively little harmful gamma radiation. With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector decreases and includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years.The amount of americium in a typical new smoke detector is 0.29 microgram (about one-third the weight of a grain of sand) with an activity of 1 microcurie/37 kilobequerels (1.0 μCi/37 kBq). Some old industrial smoke detectors (notably from the Pyrotronics Corporation) can contain up to 80 μCi. The amount of 241Am declines slowly as it decays into neptunium-237 a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). The radiated alpha-particles pass through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, which allows a small, constant electric current to pass between the capacitor plates due to the radiation ionizing the air space between. Any smoke that enters the chamber blocks/absorbs some of the alpha particles from freely passing through and reduces the ionization and therefore causes a drop in the current. The alarm's circuitry detects this drop in the current and as a result, triggers the piezoelectric buzzer to sound. Compared to the alternative <b>optical</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>detector,</b> the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which are too small to produce significant light scattering. However, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|E

If not, the response time with these two types of detectors are so close that it is only in extreme cases that this difference between optical and ionization detectors would be critical in saving lives. ...|$|R
50|$|Americium is {{the only}} {{synthetic}} element to have {{found its way into}} the household, where {{the most common type of}} smoke detector uses 241Am in the form of americium dioxide as its source of ionizing radiation. This isotope is preferred over 226Ra because it emits 5 times more alpha particles and relatively little harmful gamma radiation. Element collector Theodore Gray mentions in his book The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe: You might think that a synthetic radioactive element that follows plutonium (94)—and has a significantly shorter half-life—would be some kind of superbomb material, available only to scientists in secret laboratories. Perhaps a mad scientist is studying americium in a lair somewhere, but if you want some yourself you can simply walk into any neighborhood hardware store, supermarket, or Wal-Mart and buy some, no questions asked.The reason is not that americium is fundamentally less dangerous than the elements around it. In fact, the commonly available isotope, 241Am, is significantly more radioactive than weapons-grade plutonium, and at least as toxic. No, the difference is simply that there is a useful application for americium that requires only a very tiny amount, and for which a company was prepared to go through the effort required to carve out and get a regulatory exception. The amount of americium in a typical new smoke detector is 1 microcurie (37 kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years).

The urgent task for this type of detector is to increase its sensitivity to «black» smoke and ensure resilience to the effects of electromagnetic interference and particle smoke origin. The objective of this work is to develop a structure and algorithm of point combined fire detector that provides high sensitivity to various types of fumes, detection rate and high noise immunity.  The decision of the current objective is carried out using the proposed optical scheme of the dual-channel devices of smoke detection (for control of the radiation intensities scattered by smoke particles and passed through the smoke). The design and algorithm of the combined fire detector comprising a dual-channel laser device of smoke detection and carbon monoxide detector is developed. The results of the made detector tests indicate about its increased in comparison with the conventional single-channel point smoke fire detector sensitivity to various types of fumes and detection rate of fires.

How domestic smoke alarms affect the safety is chosen as a term of reference. Results from statistical surveys of fire deaths in Norway compared with other countries are used to describe who dies in fires. The use of and requirements for domestic smoke alarms {{in different parts of the}} world is briefly presented. The sensibility of ionic and <b>optical</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> in smouldering and flaming fires are analyzed, and an evaluation of the effectiveness of the two detector principles is made based on the test results and expected frequencies of these types of fires. Available time for evacuation is discussed based on expected time to untenable conditions, expected time to flashover, expected time to intervention from fire brigades, and the expected response time for smoke alarms. Different needs to evacuate different groups of occupants (children, elderly people, disabled) are also discussed. An analysis shows that the Norwegian requirement of domestic smoke alarms is highly cost effective. In Norway between 40 and 60 people die in fires every year, and it is estimated that 10 lives is saved every year because of installed domestic smoke alarms.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} an {{automatic}} {{fire detection system}} is the fast and reliable detection of arising fires {{in order to keep}} damage as low as possible. The European Standard EN 54 defines a series of tests to prove and certify the functionality of <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors,</b> i. e. to prove that the detector is able to detect a fire in a prescribed period of time. Unfortunately the complex task of avoiding false alarms is not completely addressed. In contrast to the well standardized methods for the evaluation of the detection capability of a <b>smoke</b> <b>detector,</b> {{there is a lack of}} a reproducible and representative test method concerning the false alarm susceptibility with regard to nuisance aerosols. The consequences of false alarms should not be underestimated, as they may cause costs to serve the operator, especially in airborne applications. Many false alarms are caused by construction works in the surrounding of <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors.</b> For that reason several dust sources have been analyzed. Several approaches are possible and have been implemented to reduce the false alarm susceptibility of <b>optical</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> caused by dust and steam, e. g. different wavelengths and scattering angles. Unfortunately the developer has no representative test methods to quantify improvements and to point out the false-alarm resistance with e. g. a seal of quality due to new developments. Important is the knowledge of dust and steam properties such as the particle size distribution in comparison to particle size distribution of smoke of a fire. This paper presents a new approach for the test of <b>smoke</b> <b>detectors</b> regarding their susceptibility to false alarms due to nuisance aerosols, like steam and dust. The presented test apparatus is a very helpful and important tool for developers as well as for test houses during the developing and certification process. System designer will have a quantitative decision criterion to find the optimal detector for a specific place of installation.

The prediction methods studied were the temperature correlation method where the detector is assumed to activate when the gas that surrounds it rises a certain temperature above ambient, the pseudo-heat detector method in which an RTI is assumed for the <b>smoke</b> <b>detector,</b> and Heskestad’s method {{which is based on}} optical density. The activation times predicted by these methods were then compared with those that were recorded during actual fire tests within a full size two-storey test house. The house was modelled on the field modelling software FDS. Two test fires were considered in this study. Both were lounge chair fires in a room {{on the ground floor of}} the house, and were flaming fires under vitiated conditions. The energy output reached by the two fires was between 600 and 1000 kW. Data collected during these tests included gas temperatures, optical density and the mass loss history of the chairs. There were also a number of radiators throughout the house that were left on for some time to heat the house before the fires were ignited. It was found that there was little difference between the temperature correlation and the pseudo-heat detector methods when a value for RTI of 1 m s was considered. It was also found that the use of an activation temperature of 20 °C above ambient within the temperature correlation method was the most appropriate method for predicting the activation times for the detectors. This value for activation temperature is high compared with other researchers, but it is likely that the radiators within the house created airflow currents that had an effect on the behaviour of the detectors. i...|$|R

Additional simulations where thus run considering soot yields of 0. 04 kgsoot/kgfuel and 0. 10 ksoot/kgfuel, and an effective heat of combustion of 25 MJ/kg.

None of the prediction algorithms where however found to predict activation times consistently comparable to the test data. Rather, it was determined that for an appropriate prediction method to be adopted for accurate assessment of a given fire scenario, consideration must be given to the: •	type of detector being assessed; •	location of the detector relative to the fire; •	mode of combustion (i. e. flaming or smouldering); and the •	growth rate of the fire...|$|R
