You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of this}} band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>trying</b> to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E

[...] Guitarist Ed O'Brien had hoped Radiohead's fourth album would comprise [...] "snappy", melodic guitar songs, but Yorke stated: [...] "There was no chance of the album sounding like that.

Surrounding this fervor, Singh was misquoted as having said that Sörenstam [...] "didn't belong" [...] on the men's tour and that he would not play if he were paired with her. What he actually said is {{that he would not be}} paired with her because his playing partner was being selected from the past champion's pool. Singh later clarified, [...] "There are guys <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>trying</b> to make a living. It's not a ladies' tour.

[...] Billboard acclaimed the song, stating [...] "the first listen's gonna blast you like a brick wall, as ears and minds try {{to make sense of the}} bombast of sonic missiles blasting from your speakers-but successive plays will make clear just how inventive this upstanding composition is." [...] It adds that [...] "it's guaranteed you've never heard Madonna-nor any other popular artist-pull it together this way." [...] While placing the song as the 66th best song of the 2000s decade, Slant Magazine commented that [...] "despite all the new pop starlets <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>trying</b> to jump her train, Madonna definitely [...] not slackening pace. When she dropped [...] "Music". she was older than Britney and Christina combined, yet she took them to school with vintage electro-boom, Eurodisco flourishes from French producer Mirwais, and her own inimitable sass."

60|$|From {{the silent}} boughs which drooped round his dark figure, a little sleepy bird uttered a faint cheep; a hedgehog, or some small beast of night, rustled {{away in the}} grass close by; a moth flew past, seeking its candle flame. And {{something}} in Miltoun's heart took wings after it, searching for the warmth and light of his blown candle of love. Then, in the hush he heard a sound as of a branch ceaselessly trailed through long grass, fainter and fainter, more and more distinct; again fainter; but nothing could he see that should make that homeless sound. And the sense of some near but unseen presence crept on him, till the hair moved on his scalp. If God would light the moon or stars, and let him see! If God would end the expectation of this night, let one wan glimmer down into her garden, and one wan glimmer into his breast! But it stayed dark, and the homeless noise never ceased. The weird thought came to Miltoun that it was made by his own heart, wandering <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>trying</b> to feel warm again. He {{closed his eyes and}} at once knew that it was not his heart, but indeed some external presence, unconsoled. And stretching his hands out he moved forward to arrest that sound. As he reached the railing, it ceased. And he saw a flame leap up, a pale broad pathway of light blanching the grass.|$|E

In 98% of the inspections, the Iraqis did everything we asked them to because it dealt with disarmament.
