25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, as Pomerol's {{transition}} to a red wine producing district was completed, Cabernet Franc was the dominant grape variety. However, an early spring frost in 1956 killed {{a large portion of}} the Cabernet Franc plantings and many estates took this event as an opportunity to replant with the higher yielding and earlier ripening Merlot. Despite Merlot's tendency to suffer from coulure if the weather is cold and rainy during flowering, the grape quickly rose to prominence in Pomerol and has become the grape most closely associated with the region. Nevertheless, very few Pomerols are pure Merlot and Cabernet Franc is still valued for the tannic structure and acidity it gives, which can add longevity and aging potential to the wines. In fact, as the trend of the late 20th and early 21st century towards harvesting Merlot later and at increasingly higher sugar levels has continued, the role of Cabernet Franc in balancing the opulent but potentially flabby nature of <b>over</b> <b>ripe</b> Merlot has become even more appreciated by Pomerol winemakers.|$|E

Banana powder is made from dried and ground fully ripened banana puree and thus does not have the fiber of banana peel flour content nor the resistant starch of green banana flour.

50|$|The Arneis vine {{can be a}} {{difficult}} grape to cultivate, with naturally low acidity and tendency to get <b>over</b> <b>ripe</b> if it is harvested after September. Additionally, the vine is prone to powdery mildew though recent cloning research has begun to isolate clones of Arneis that have more tolerance to mildew. The vine's propensity for low crop yields and for the wine to oxidize easily, contributed to its steady decline {{in the early to}} mid 20th century. Better understanding of the variety in the later half of the century helped revive the variety as winemakers found that the chalky, sandy soils around Roero gave the grapes more acidity and structure while Arneis grapes planted in sandy clay soil developed an elegant and exotic perfume.|$|E

50|$|Glucose, {{along with}} fructose, {{is one of}} the primary sugars found in wine grapes. In wine, glucose tastes less sweet than fructose. It is a six-carbon sugar {{molecule}} derived from the breakdown of sucrose. At the beginning of the ripening stage there is usually more glucose than fructose present in the grape (as much as five times more) but the rapid development of fructose shifts the ratio to where at harvest there are generally equal amounts. Grapes that are <b>over</b> <b>ripe,</b> such as some late harvest wines, may have more fructose than glucose. During fermentation, yeast cells break down and convert glucose first. The linking of glucose molecules with aglycone, in a process that creates glycosides, also plays a role in the resulting flavor of the wine due to their relation and interactions with phenolic compounds like anthocyanins and terpenoids.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} common {{ancestor}} of modern humans {{and the three}} living African ape species a genetic mutation occurred that increased the rate that alcohol was metabolized. This fact initially supports the "drunken monkey hypothesis" which states that natural selection should have favoured individuals that routinely incorporated alcohol- and thus energy-rich fruits into their diet. However, random observations from apes living in the wild do not provide evidence for such kind of choosey feeding behaviours. To investigate {{whether or not the}} living great apes have evolved a preference of alcohol-rich fruits <b>over</b> normal <b>ripe</b> fruits we performed a bioassay with captive chimpanzees offering them apple puree with and without rum flavour. Initially, the chimpanzees were curious about the alcohol-flavoured apple puree and feed on it when it was presented to them for the very first time. Once tasted, however, they lost interest in it indicating that chimpanzees are able to perceive, but do not prefer alcohol-rich fruits more than non-alcoholic fruits. Thus, we think that for our hominoid ancestors from the late Miocene the possibility to consume alcohol-rich fruits was helpful to survive periods of food scarcity, but did not lead to a genetic predisposition for alcohol...|$|R

The treatments consisted of dividing the seeds, which were obtained from three different fruit stages (green mature, ripe and <b>over</b> <b>ripe),</b> into two lots. One lot of seeds was decorticated and the other one was left intact (undecorticated). The parameters recorded were germination percentage, number of days required for germination, number of embryos per seed (polyembryony), plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves and length and diameter of roots. The results revealed that higher values of germination percentage, number of embryos (polyembryony), number of leaves and root diameter and fewer days for germination were shown by decorticated seeds than undecorticated (intact) ones, regardless of the stage of fruit development. Seeds obtained from green, mature fruits, whether decorticated or undecorticated, took more days to germinate than those from ripe or <b>over</b> <b>ripe</b> fruits. Generally, higher values of plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves and root length and diameter were given by decorticated seeds than undecorticated ones, regardless of the stage of fruit development.

50|$|On March 3, 1966, the {{atmosphere}} <b>over</b> Mississippi was <b>ripe</b> for a violent tornado. In the upper-levels of the troposphere, a fairly strong jet stream, with winds estimated at 140 to 150 mph, oriented itself northeastward over the state, providing strong diffluence. A large mid-level trough, centered near Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was the overall system {{that produced the}} tornado. It featured low millibar heights roughly four times below the standard mean. Additionally, an unusually strong mid-level jet stream with 105 mph winds provided additional energy to the storm system. The final factor {{in the development of}} the Candlestick Park storm was a subtle wind shift near the surface. At the higher levels, winds flowed from the southwest to the northeast in relation to the jet stream; however, closer to the surface, the inflow from the low pressure system over South Dakota resulted in a south to north flow, allowing for rotation within storms.|$|R
5000|$|Some flowers can {{be found}} on the puriri all year round, though it does flower most heavily <b>over</b> winter. <b>Ripe</b> fruit can also be found all year round, but is more common over the summer. Puriri is a very {{important}} tree for native birds in the top half of the North Island because it provides a constant year-round food supply. Flowers and fruit are carried at the tips of the branches.The fruit or drupe is a bright red (usually) to a pale yellow (rarely, and only on white flowered trees) [...] "cherry". It can grow as big as a cherry, but it is unpleasantly astringent. When broken, the fruit has a bright thin juice, and a faint grape smell. Puriri fruit is not the most nutritious sort in the New Zealand bush (high in carbohydrates, not lipids, sugars or calcium), but it is always there. The nut (endocarp) inside the drupe is a very hard pear-shaped kernel that can contain up to 4 seeds. The seedlings from one kernel can germinate at the same time or be spread over a year. The nut has four apertures in the endocarp each guarded by an oval door and each leading to a seed chamber. The Puriri is self-fertile with self fertilization (autogamy) possible. Seed production in 12 samples ranged from 8% to 45% with usually only 1 or 2 live seeds in a fruit. Low seed production is due to inefficiencies in pollination, as well as breakdown of apparently fully developed seeds. The factors controlling germination and opening of the doors are unknown, and most seed would appear to perish within the Imprisoning nut.|$|R
