5000|$|... is {{performed}} by applying external {{pressure on the}} sclera, for example with a spring plunger, while observing the retinal vessels through an ophthalmoscope. The pressure is gradually increased until the central retinal vein begins to pulsate, which happens at the point when the applied external pressure nears the VOP and is approximately equal to ICP. The original method was described in 1925 by Baurmann [...] and belongs to the public domain, but several modifications have been recently patented that combine the classic <b>ophthalmodynamometry</b> with reflectance oximetry of the retina [...] or ultrasound measurement of blood flow in the central retinal artery, or automate the method by adding a camera and an image processing software capable of recognizing venous pulsations from a sequence of images of the eye fundus. Evaluation in patients confirmed a strong linear relationship and clinically negligible differences (2-3mmHg) between VOP and the invasively measured ICP. <b>Ophthalmodynamometry</b> requires dilated pupils, a skilled physician or medic and collaboration of the patient, which all hampers its applicability in the field. It cannot be applied in cases of ocular trauma or conditions that selectively affect the optic nerve, and gives erroneously high readings {{in the presence of}} a papilledema, which may persist long after ICP has returned to normal.|$|E

50|$|Eye {{provides}} {{another possible}} {{window into the}} pressure changes in the intracranial compartment thanks {{to the fact that}} the space between the optic nerve and its sheath is a continuation of the subarachnoid space, and is consequently filled with cerebrospinal fluid whose pressure is equal to intracranial pressure. Intracranial hypertension will thus manifest in increased diameter of the optic nerve sheath, and will impede the blood flow through the central retinal vein that courses within the sheath, along and in part inside of the optical nerve. The impediment of venous return causes visible changes in the eye fundus (venous engorgement, and papilledema, i.e. swelling and elevation of the optic nerve disc) that can be observed with an ophthalmoscope and have therefore been used by clinicians for more than a century as signs of increased ICP. Quantitative assessment of ICP can be made noninvasively in two different ways: by measuring changes in diameter of the optic nerve sheath with an appropriate technique (ultrasound or MRI), or by using <b>ophthalmodynamometry</b> to determine the pressure in the central retinal vein, which is normally slightly higher (1- 2mmHg) than ICP. Intracranial hypertension also induces changes at the cellular or axonal level such as the swelling of the fibers of the optic nerve that form the innermost layer of the retina (so called nerve fiber layer - NFL). The information provided by the classic ophthalmoscopy is however only qualitative and may be inconclusive during early phases of intracranial hypertension since it usually takes between two and four hours from the onset of ICP elevation for a papilledema to develop.|$|E

40|$|Background: A recent {{development}} in non-invasive techniques to predict intracranial pressure (ICP) termed venous <b>ophthalmodynamometry</b> (vODM) has made measurements in absolute units possible. However, {{there has been}} little progress to show utility in the clinic or field.

40|$|Glaucoma {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{blindness}} worldwide. Historically, it has been considered an ocular disease primary caused by pathological intraocular pressure (IOP). Recently, researchers have emphasized intracranial pressure (ICP), as translaminar counter pressure against IOP may play a role in glaucoma development and progression. It remains controversial what is the best way to measure ICP in glaucoma. Currently, the ‘gold standard’ for ICP measurement is invasive measurement of the pressure in the cerebrospinal fluid via lumbar puncture or via implantation of the pressure sensor into the brains ventricle. However, the direct measurements of ICP are not without risk due to its invasiveness and potential risk of intracranial haemorrhage and infection. Therefore, invasive ICP measurements are prohibitive due to safety needs, especially in glaucoma patients. Several approaches have been proposed to estimate ICP non-invasively, including transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, tympanic membrane displacement, <b>ophthalmodynamometry,</b> measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter and two-depth transcranial Doppler technology. Special emphasis is put on the two-depth transcranial Doppler technology, which uses an ophthalmic artery as a natural ICP sensor.

40|$|The {{management}} {{of patients with}} cerebral transient ischemic attacks and carotid artery stenosis remains controversial. Noninvasive techniques help to determine which patients require surgical intervention without exposing the majority of patients to the risk and discomfort of invasive procedures. Measurement of ophthalmic artery pressure by <b>ophthalmodynamometry</b> or oculoplethysmography gives a representation of perfusion pressure in the internal carotid artery circulation. Doppler ultrasound studies can define the extent of obstruction to flow at the carotid artery bifurcation and assess collateral flow from the external carotid artery. Real time B-mode ultrasonography can detect nonobstructive ulcerated plaque in the carotid artery bifurcation. Employing these examinations in a test battery can identify hemodynamically significant lesions, which {{are more likely to}} precipitate a stroke. The information obtained from these studies can be utilized in patients with episodes of cerebral transient ischemic attacks, asymptomatic carotid artery bruits and vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Noninvasive carotid artery testing is also useful in screening patients with nonspecific symptoms, such as dizziness or light-headedness, which may be related to decreased flow in the carotid circulation. Noninvasive carotid artery testing can provide valuable anatomic and physiologic information required in the appropriate {{management of}} patients with cerebrovascular disease. It is of particular value in managing patients with heart disease who are at high risk for complications from invasive procedures...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: There is no {{easy way}} to {{estimate}} the intracranial pressure (ICP) non-invasively. The retinal vein can exhibit large amplitude oscillations {{at the level of the}} lamina cribrosa under certain circumstances. The aim of this study was to develop a theoretical understanding of the conditions required to establish this vigorous oscillatory behaviour and whether observations of it could lead to a non-invasive estimate of the ICP. Methods: A mathematical model was constructed in which the central retinal vein was modelled as two Starling resistors in series, one located in the eye and the other in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space, separated by a region where it was not collapsible corresponding to its course within the optic nerve itself. The intraocular pressure (IOP) and ICP were modelled as sinusoidal wave forms. Results: The model predicts an approximately linear relationship between the IOP and the ICP at the point of onset of oscillatory behaviour. The predicted onset IOP also depends weakly on the retinal blood flow rate and the vein diameter and is only mildly sensitive to the phase difference between the two pressure waveforms. The predicted onset curve shows encouraging agreement with measurements in canines. Conclusions: The model suggests that it may be possible to estimate of the ICP from observations of the retinal venous pulse using a modified form of <b>ophthalmodynamometry.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND: Mechanical and {{vascular}} {{factors may}} both contribute to glaucoma. This {{study investigated the}} relation of mechanical to vascular factors by examining how acute IOP elevation altered flow velocities in the central retinal and ophthalmic arteries. METHODS: IOP was elevated from a baseline near 14 to approximately 45 mm Hg using suction <b>ophthalmodynamometry.</b> During recovery from scleral suction, IOP fell to near 8 mm Hg. At each IOP, peak systolic and end diastolic velocities (PSV and EDV) were measured in the central retinal and ophthalmic arteries using colour Doppler imaging (Siemens Quantum 2000). Eleven healthy people served as subjects. RESULTS: Acute elevation in IOP had no effect upon PSV, EDV, or the derived resistance index in the ophthalmic artery: flow velocities in this vessel were identical at IOP of 8 mm Hg or 45 mm Hg. In contrast, in the central retinal artery, PSV and EDV fell, and the resistance index rose, in steady progression as IOP was acutely elevated (each p < 0. 01). At IOP of 45 mm Hg, EDV was virtually absent and the resistance index was very nearly 1. 0. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmic arterial haemodynamics are unrelated to acute fluctuations of the IOP over a wide range, suggesting that ocular hypertension itself cannot induce vascular dysfunction in this artery. In contrast, flow velocities in the central retinal artery were highly IOP dependent, implying that haemodynamic and mechanical factors are closely linked in this vascular bed...|$|E
40|$|Microgravity-induced {{changes in}} fluid {{distribution}} and other physiological factors due to space flight have been implicated {{as the cause}} of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in a number of space crewmembers. The modest levels of ICP elevation and absence of severe symptoms in this group do not warrant invasive diagnostic interventions. However, the long-term trends and residual or consequential changes secondary to the observed ICP elevation in this group are not yet known. Therefore, close attention is needed to evaluate the potential techniques of noninvasively assessing ICP, including those feasible for in-flight use. Of particular interest is continuity between ground and in-flight testing, whereby data from the same or different techniques allow reasonably dependable estimation of ICP trends and responses. Methods: A thorough review of current literature, analysis of NASA data, and interviews with subject matter experts were conducted to construct a presentation that reflects {{the state of the art}} for noninvasive ICP measurement and monitoring.

40|$|SUMMARY A {{diagnosis}} of pulseless disease {{was made in}} a young European female patient who presented with symptoms confined to the visual system. She demonstrated the classical ocular features of pulseless disease but developed the previously unrecorded complication of ischaemic optic neuropathy. These findings are discussed. Ocular symptoms may be the presenting feature of occlusive disease in vessels arising from the aortic arch. Reduced perfusion to {{the upper part of}} the body leads to diminished or absent peripheral pulses, making the descriptive term 'pulseless disease ' a suitable alternative to the many eponymous titles ' for this condition. In 1827 Robert Adams 2 recorded the first case of pulseless disease. Twelve years later an elegant des-cription by Davy 3 detailed the symptoms of confusion and syncope in a 55 -year-old British Army officer. His illness was attributed to a chest wound sustained at the Battle of Waterloo. At necropsy a thoracic aortic aneurysm was found with involvement of the great vessels suggesting a {{diagnosis of}} syphilis. During life diminished pulsation at the neck and wrist had been noted. In 1908 Takayasu 4 was the first to describe the retinal complications, and at the same meeting Onishi and Kagashini related the ocular changes to the absence of radial pulses. Comprehensive accounts of the clinical features with pathological correlation followed, and an elaborate review by Pinkham 5 in 1955 established visual symptoms in at least 70 % of the patients. In 1976 Uyama and Asayama 6 reclassi-fied the retinal changes and found a correlation between microaneurysm formation and the systolic <b>ophthalmodynamometry</b> pressures.

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{potential}} relationship between optic disc haemorrhage, venous pulsation pressure (VPP), ocular perfusion pressures and visual field change in glaucomatous and glaucoma suspect eyes. This prospective observational study examined 155 open angle glaucoma or glaucoma suspect eyes from 78 patients over 5 years. Patients were followed with 3 monthly non-mydriatic disc photographs, 6 monthly standard automated perimetry and annual <b>ophthalmodynamometry.</b> The number of disc haemorrhages in each hemidisc was counted across the study period.

Mean age of the cohort was 71. 9 ± 7. 3 Years. 76 out of 155 eyes (49 %) followed for a mean period of 64. 2 months had at least 1 disc haemorrhage. 62 (81. 6 %) of these 76 eyes had recurrent haemorrhages, {{with a mean of}} 5. 94 recurrences over 64. 2 months. Using univariate analysis, rate of visual field change (P< 0. 0001), VPP (P = 0. 0069), alternative ocular perfusion pressure (CRADP-VPP, P = 0. 0036), carotid resistance index (DiastBP-CRADP, P = 0. 0108) and mean brachial blood pressure (P = 0. 0203) were significantly associated with the number of disc haemorrhages. Using multivariate analysis, increased baseline visual field sensitivity (P = 0. 0243, coefficient = 0. 0275) was significantly associated with disc haemorrhage, in conjunction with higher VPP (P = 0. 0029, coefficient = 0. 0631), higher mean blood pressure (P = 0. 0113, coefficient = 0. 0190), higher carotid resistance index (P = 0. 0172, coefficient = 0. 0566), and rate of visual field loss (P< 0. 0001, coefficient = - 2. 0695). Higher VPP was associated with disc haemorrhage and implicates the involvement of venous pathology, but the effect size is small. Additionally, a greater carotid resistance index suggests that flow pathology in the ophthalmic or carotid arteries may be associated with disc haemorrhage...|$|E
