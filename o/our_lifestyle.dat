However, Thornton states that he was largely involved with {{the production of the}} album. Thornton is quoted as saying [...] "Automator and Kurt are probably receiving more credit than I did, but I was a big musical person behind Octagon." [...] Nakamura has said he wanted Dr. Octagonecologyst to stand out from other hip hop albums, citing the music of Eric B. & Rakim, Mantronix, and Run-D.M.C. as influences. [...] "Hip-hop was always inventive. Then the '90s hit and everyone wants to be Dr. Dre; {{no one wants to be}} their own thing anymore. Everyone now wants to have the Lexus and deal pounds of drugs. We don't do that. That's not <b>our</b> <b>lifestyle.</b> You don't see us coming out with the fur coat. There's more to music than that," [...] Nakamura said. The album incorporates use of organic instrumentation and features Moog synthesizer, flute, and string instruments.|$|E

40|$|The article {{addresses}} a thorny issue in our time, sedentarism. Concern over sedentarism pervades current medical discourse {{as well as}} public opinion. However, this article does not enter into debate or discuss solutions. Instead, it offers a different perspective {{on an issue that}} has been largely defined by the medical profession. Physical activity and sports are a source of health; biological and epidemiological studies have demonstrated this. But health is not merely the absence of disease or the biophysical state of the individual. Culture and living conditions contribute to it. Well-being is also a reflection of elements of a social and not just biological nature. Thus, the study of health and well-being must not ignore the value of the social sciences. Here we analyze the extent to which <b>our</b> <b>lifestyles</b> (active or sedentary) are determinants of our health and subjective well-being. The results provide a reflection on the cost of <b>our</b> <b>lifestyles,</b> not only in regard to our own health and well-being, but also regarding the health system itself. Hence, our diagnosis is based on the idea that, as with health and well-being, <b>our</b> <b>lifestyles</b> depend on cultural prescriptions and not merely medical ones.
