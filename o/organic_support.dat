These block copolymers were synthesized by sequential atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of styrene and methyl 4 -vinylbenzoate, followed by hydrolysis.

Economic {{evaluation}} of <b>organic</b> farming <b>support</b> as an agri-environmental measure at Swiss agricultural sector level. Land Use Policy, 31, 196 - 208 The economic efficiency of financial <b>support</b> of <b>organic</b> farming {{has been questioned}} by economists and policy makers. However, little empirical {{research has been done}} in order to evaluate the economic performance of these payments. Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} calculate the costeffectiveness of <b>organic</b> farming <b>support</b> in achieving environmental policy targets compared to other agri-environmental measures. The cost-effectiveness of agri-environmental measures can be understood as a function of policy uptake, environmental effects, and public expenditure. Taking the Swiss agricultural sector as an empirical case study, cost-effectiveness of <b>organic</b> farming <b>support</b> and other single agri-environmental measures was calculated. For this purpose, the sector-representative PMP model FARMIS was extended by three modules encompassing a) life cycle assessments for fossil energy use, biodiversity and eutrophication according to the SALCA methodology, b) public expenditure, including policy-related transaction costs, and c) uptake of agri-environmental measures. The calculations revealed a slightly higher policy cost with <b>organic</b> farming <b>support</b> of 14 CHF/ha for a 1 % average improvement in the environmental indicators, compared to a combination of three single agri-environmental measures (11 CHF/ha), including both extensification of arable land and meadows. In view of an average public expenditure on agriculture of 2. 5 kCHF per ha in Switzerland, these differences can be considered as marginal. Sensitivity analyses confirm that the cost-effectiveness of <b>organic</b> farming <b>support</b> is very similar to combined agri-environmental measures. Furthermore, the model reveals that the cost-effectiveness of specific agri-environmental measures is higher when implemented on organic farms rather than on non-organic farms. Peer reviewe...|$|R
