50|$|At 09:15, while {{descending}} through 15,000 feet (4,572 m), the low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>indicator</b> on the TriStar's number 2 engine illuminated. The {{flight engineer}} {{noted that the}} oil pressure on the #2 engine was fluctuating between 15 and 25 psi; the minimum pressure required for normal engine operation was 30 psi. The captain ordered the flight engineer {{to shut down the}} engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} cabin includes {{seats for}} driver and one passenger. The interior is hardly upholstered; the earliest versions lacked of cover {{even on the}} ceiling. The side windows are openable by sliding front half on rails. The dashboard {{is equipped with a}} speedometer including odometer and a combination gauge that shows fuel level and engine temperature, and includes also charging and <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>indicator</b> lights. The engine starter is operated by a separate button on dashboard. The heater nozzles are directed to the windscreen and legroom. The windscreen washing device works by squeezing a plastic bottle filled with washing fluid. The driver's seat is adjustable by rails.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{instruments}} were typically provided, including a compass, altimeter, tachometer, <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>indicator,</b> airspeed gauge, radiator temperature dial, fuel air pressure indicator, fuel selector, and air exchange; these were somewhat difficult to view {{due to their}} low-set position in the cockpit. According to [...] "Dodge" [...] Bailey, Chief Test Pilot of the Shuttleworth Collection, the S.E.5's cockpit was [...] "the best of the bunch from the era". Individual in-service S.E.5s would often receive customisations and user-specified tweaks {{at the request of}} their pilots. Popular changes included reducing the dihedral of the wings in order to increase its manoeuvrability and the removal of the head faring to increase the pilot's visibility to the rear. James McCudden, an ace pilot, was famous for his prolific fine-tuning of his aircraft in order to produce improved performance from it; McCudden was able to increase the top speed by 9 MPH and to raise the service ceiling from the standard 17,000 ft to 20,000 ft. His adaptions included replacing the standard pistons with high compression versions, shortening the exhaust (saving weight and improving exhaust scavenging), and changes to mixture, ignition and other engine settings as well as fitting a scavenged propeller spinner (which he himself credited as gaining 3 mph alone) [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{dashboard}} instrumentation includes speedometer with odometer, {{revolution counter}} and gauges showing <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> fuel, cooling water temperature, air pressure of both circuits and ammeter. There are lamps for <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>indicators,</b> alternator charging, differential interlock engagement, air pressure system warning, parking brake engagement and engine overheating indicator, and switches for headlights, heater and ventilation, windscreen wipers, indicators, differential interlock, hand throttle and engine shutdown; the models with tandem axle are also equipped with tandem lifting and lowering switches.|$|R

2500|$|The Bristol 138, the record-breaking {{machine is}} a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane designed to fly at extremely high altitudes for the era. Aviation publication Flight observed {{of the aircraft}} that: [...] "except for its size, reminds one very much of the little Bristol Brownie.... the machine is the largest single-seater aeroplane ever built". The pilot was seated in a relatively spacious cockpit, which was heated by air directed from the oil coolers set within the wings, which could be actively controlled. Instrumentation included fore-and-aft levels, <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> gauges, airspeed <b>indicator</b> and fuel gauge, engine speed indicator and pyrometer. Purpose-built recording altimeters, developed by the RAE, were housed within the wings, while a separate altimeter was installed within the cockpit for the pilot.|$|R

50|$|The <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{monitored}} by an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> sending unit, usually mounted to the block of the engine. This {{can either be}} a spring-loaded pressure sensor or an electronic pressure sensor, {{depending on the type}} of sending unit. Problems with the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> sending unit or the connections between it and the driver's display can cause abnormal <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> readings when <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is perfectly acceptable.|$|R

40|$|The {{basis of}} {{the design of the}} oil system of a H. V. oil filled cable circuit is {{considered}} in particular the choice of oil feed locations along the cable route. Methods are established for determining the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> tank requirements and the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> response on application of step or pulse loads for typical oil sections of a single core H. V. oil filled cable circuit. These methods are applied to an existing 132 KV installation and minimum <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> tankage requirements and the maximum and minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressures</b> considering various loading conditions determined. To establish the minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> the <b>oil</b> <b>pressures</b> occurring on switching off various continuous loads are compared to that occurring on switching off load shortly after having switched on. Recommendations are made for similar circuits based on the loading condition giving the minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> Possible ways of verifying the theoretical methods and en electrical analogue of the oil system are considered...|$|R
50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is higher}} when {{the engine is}} cold due to the {{increased}} viscosity of the oil, and also increases with engine speed until the relief valve in the oil pump opens to divert excess flow. <b>Oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is lowest under hot idling conditions, and the minimum pressure allowed by the manufacturer's tolerances is usually given at this point. Excessive <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> may indicate a blocked filter, blocked oil gallery or the wrong grade of <b>oil.</b> Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> indicates worn bearings or a broken oil pump.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{control of}} <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> of wet-clutch {{is of great}} {{importance}} for improving shift quality. Based on dynamic models of two-gear planetary transmission and hydraulic control system, a trajectory tracking model of <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> was built by sliding mode control method. An experiment was designed to verify the validity of hydraulic control system, through which the relationship between duty cycle of on-off valve and <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> of clutch was determined. The tracking effect was analyzed by simulation. Results showed that <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> could follow well the optimal trajectory and the shift quality was effectively improved...|$|R
5000|$|Colour {{may also}} {{communicate}} {{information about the}} nature of the tell-tale, for example red may signify that the vehicle cannot continue driving (e.g. <b>oil</b> <b>pressure).)</b> Many older vehicles used schemes which were specific to the manufacturer, e.g. some British Fords of the 1960's used green for <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> warning, while many other makes of the same era used amber for <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{has been}} a {{technical}} {{change in the way}} <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is regulated in the clutch, i.e. FWD switching. <b>Oil</b> <b>pressure</b> on the clutch plates is now regulated by a centrifugal valve integrated in the electric axial six piston oil pump. Compared to the previous generation, the Haldex 5 system is 1.4 kg lighter (ca. 6.6 kg without oil) and simpler as it does not contain an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> accumulator.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> idiot light lights when engine <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> {{drops below}} a {{predetermined}} level. The light normally appears when the vehicle ignition is turned on, but {{the engine is}} not running, as it detects no <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> due to the oil pump not operating (the oil pump is powered off the crankshaft, so only operates when the engine is running). It normally turns off a few seconds after engine start as the oil pump starts working and building up <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> This tell-tale can bear the legend [...] or a pictogram of an oil can. Some cars illuminate the light red or yellow, depending on the action needed to be taken.|$|R
5000|$|Improvements {{should be}} made in {{barometric}} <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are only}} 4 reasons for low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> 1) no <b>oil</b> or low {{oil in the}} engine 2) worn or {{defective}} oil pump or broken pressure relief valve spring 3) worn main bearings (big ends {{have nothing to do}} with <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> as most of the pressure to these are supplied by centrifugal force and 4) oil gallery fracture or blockage. Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> can cause engine damage. First thing to fail will be cam carrier bearings if vehicle is OHC as this is fed through a restrictor and low pressure will starve top of engine of lube.If pistons have crown jets eg scania,could cause piston/liner nip. Also the crankshaft and connecting rod bearings will seize. Indications of low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> may be that the warning light is on, a low pressure reading on the gauge, or clattering/clinking noises from the engine. Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is a problem that must be addressed immediately to prevent serious damage.|$|R
