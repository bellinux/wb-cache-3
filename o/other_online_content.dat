We conclude with recommended strategies for creating a culture of accessibility around UGC...|$|R

30|$|Monitoring {{social media}} to spot {{emerging}} issues and trends {{and to assess}} public opinion concerning topics and events is of considerable interest to security professionals; however, performing such analysis is technically challenging. The opinions of individuals and groups are typically expressed as informal com-munications and are buried in the vast, and largely irrelevant, output of millions of bloggers and <b>other</b> <b>online</b> <b>content</b> producers. Consequently, effectively exploiting these data requires the development of new, automated methods of analysis [3, 4]. Although helpful computational analytics have been derived for traditional forms of written content, less {{has been done to}} develop techniques that are well-suited to the particular characteristics of the content found in social media.|$|E

40|$|This paper solves a {{persistent}} methodological problem for social scientists studying the political web: representative sampling. Virtu- ally all existing {{studies of the}} political web are based on incomplete samples, and therefore lack generalizability. In this paper, I combine methods from computer science and sampling theory to conduct an automated snowball census of the political web and constructs an all- but-complete index of English political websites. I check the robust- ness of this index, use it to generate descriptive statistics for the entire political web, and demonstrate that studies based on ad hoc sampling strategies {{are likely to be}} biased in important ways. In future research, this bias can be eliminated by using this index as a sampling universe. In addition, the methods and open-source software presented here can be used to creating similar sampling frames for <b>other</b> <b>online</b> <b>content</b> domains...|$|E
40|$|Several {{years of}} {{research}} and evidence have demonstrated that Open Source Software (OSS) portals often contain {{a large amount of}} software projects that simply do not evolve, developed by relatively small communities, struggling to attract a sustained number of contributors. These portals have started to increasingly act as a storage for abandoned projects, and researchers and practitioners should try and point out how to take advantage of such content. Similarly, <b>other</b> <b>online</b> <b>content</b> portals (like Wikipedia) could be harvested for valuable content. In this paper we argue that, even with differences in the requested expertise, many projects reliant on content and contributions by users undergo a similar evolution, and follow similar patterns: when a project fails to attract contributors, it appears to be not evolving, or abandoned. Far from a negative finding, even those projects could provide valuable content that should be harvested and identified based on common characteristics: by using the attributes of “usefulness ” and “modularity ” we isolate valuable content in both Wikipedia pages and OSS projects.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the phenomenon of bloggers, social networkers and <b>other</b> <b>online</b> <b>content</b> creators who find themselves negotiating a position between their expectations of {{the internet as a}} system of places and the architecture of the internet as a limitless space, a 'non-place'. The authors argue that conflicting notions of the internet constitute an uneven and contradictory 'internet imaginary', and shape expe-rience online. The law, when confronted with the ambiguities and equivocations of the internet imaginary so far prefers to fall back on the simple idea of the internet as a public space, a space that is not protected from peering eyes and ears of outside observers, a space where activities cannot be made private (at least without special technological expertise), because accidents inevitably happen. So the law will not underwrite users' expectations of privacy. For now, however, many users of the internet continue to expect from the law a guarantee of privacy in their online experience, at least in some circumstances, even contrary to the assertions of those who insist that architecturally the internet is an open space...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the interdependence between a company’s stock returns and user-generated content (UGC) concerning (the products of) that company. We investigate this interdependence {{by studying the}} presence of mean, shock and volatility spillover effects between returns and UGC. The number {{of positive and negative}} tweets, blog posts, forum posts and daily searches for ticker symbols in the Google search engine are used as measures of UGC. The UGC data is collected via multiple sources over a six month period. Using a multivariate generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity- Baba, Engle, Kraft and Kroner (GARCH-BEKK) model we identify the source, magnitude and significance of mean, shock and volatility spillover effects between UGC and returns. We estimate the BEKK model for 27 different combinations of variables and compute averages over those results. The (average) results confirm the presence of spillover effects and show that there is a stronger connection- both in magnitude and in significance- in terms of mean, shock and volatility spillovers from UGC to returns than from returns to UGC. There are significant spillover effects between the various UGC metrics as well and these are larger than the effects from returns to UGC. This indicates that online content is affected more by <b>other</b> <b>online</b> <b>content</b> than by stock returns. Positive and negative content exhibit different spillover effects...|$|E
