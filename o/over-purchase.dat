5000|$|Every {{company has}} the {{challenge}} of matching its supply volume to customer demand. How well the company manages this challenge has {{a major impact on}} its profitability. In contrast to the traditional [...] "binge and purge" [...] inventory cycle in which companies <b>over-purchase</b> product to prepare for possible demand spikes and then discards extra product, inventory optimization seeks to more efficiently match supply to expected customer demand. APQC Open Standards data shows that the median company carries an inventory of 10.6 percent of annual revenues. The typical cost of carrying inventory is at least 10.0 percent of the inventory value. So the median company spends over 1 percent of revenues carrying inventory, although for some companies the number is much higher.|$|E

Fitzgerald's original plan called for eliminating the estate tax upon death and instead enacting an annual 1.77% surcharge on the adjusted gross income of the wealthiest 1% of the population, and claims that the IRS achieves the same annual revenue it receives {{from the collection of}} the estate tax. In 2013, the ASSET proposal was changed to an entirely voluntary system in which taxpayers would opt-in to pay a 1% surcharge on annual income while they are alive and no estate tax would be owed upon their death, but for capital gains on inherited assets. The group claims that their proposal for estate tax reform would eliminate the need for sheltering assets in unproductive trusts to avoid the tax as well as the need to <b>over-purchase</b> life insurance, which they say diverts resources away from investment and job creation.|$|E
