5|$|The tornadoes {{continued}} to track through central Alabama that afternoon {{and into the}} early evening hours. A dangerous and destructive tornado struck the city of Cullman, Alabama, at around 3:00p.m. CDT (2000 UTC). This large, multiple-vortex tornado was captured on several tower cameras from television stations such as Fox affiliate WBRC (channel 6) and ABC affiliate WBMA-LD/WCFT-TV/WJSU-TV (channels 58, 33, and 40) out of Birmingham. The tornado caused extensive destruction in downtown Cullman, a city of about 20,000 people; the tornado was ultimately rated an EF4. The final damage count was 867 residences and 94 businesses in Cullman, and 6 people were killed throughout the path. The town of Cordova, Alabama, which had already been damaged by an EF3 tornado from the initial round of storms, was struck by an EF4 tornado that killed 13 people. Two violent EF4 tornadoes also ripped through Jackson County, Alabama, one of which caused a fatality near Bridgeport, while the other passed near Pisgah and into Georgia where it caused major damage in Trenton, killing 14 people along its path. At around 5:10p.m. CDT (2210 UTC), a very large and exceptionally destructive tornado struck Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and about 40 minutes later, the same tornado struck the northern suburbs of nearby Birmingham. A tornado emergency was issued for both cities, {{along with many other}} cities that day. Many local television stations, including WBRC and WBMA-LD/WCFT/WJSU, as well as CBS affiliate WIAT (channel 42), broadcast live footage of this long-tracked tornado in both Tuscaloosa and Birmingham. A debris ball was observed by the Birmingham NEXRAD, indicating that the tornado was causing extreme damage. This tornado killed 64 people and caused extensive devastation in densely populated areas, and the tornado struck several of the same small communities as the April 1956 F4, the April 1977 F5 and the April 1998 F5 tornadoes that hit portions of the Birmingham area. The supercell responsible for the Tuscaloosa/Birmingham EF4 tornado originated in Newton County, Mississippi. The supercell also produced an EF4 tornado later that evening that killed 22 people as it struck areas in and around Ohatchee, Alabama, before eventually crossing into Georgia and causing additional damage near Cave Spring before dissipating. Further to the south, a mile-wide EF3 tornado killed 7 people in mostly rural areas and caused major damage {{in the small town of}} Eoline. The final EF5 tornado of the day caused remarkable damage in and around the town of Rainsville, Alabama, killing 25 people before crossing into Georgia and dissipating. Tornadoes {{continued to}} touch down further to the northeast as the sun set, particularly in Georgia. This included a long-tracked EF4 that caused major damage in Ringgold, Georgia, Apison, Tennessee, and Cleveland, Tennessee, killing 20 people along the path. After dark, violent tornadoes continued to touch down, and a nighttime EF4 tornado destroyed many lakeside homes at Lake Martin in eastern Alabama, killing seven people. Additional strong nighttime tornadoes occurred in Georgia, including an EF3 that killed two people in Barnesville, and another EF3 that destroyed multiple homes and killed <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>at</b> Lake Burton.|$|E

As the pressure outside the submarine is greater than the pressure inside, this must be equalised before the outer door of the escape chamber is opened. The escape chamber is flooded with the occupant having to wait until the chamber is completely full of water. Only then will the pressure within the escape chamber be equal to the outside sea pressure.|$|E
25|$|In present-day Maine, the Mi'kmaq and the Maliseet raided {{numerous}} New England villages. At {{the end of}} April 1755, they raided Gorham, {{killing two}} men and a family. Next they appeared in New Boston (Gray) {{and went through the}} neighbouring towns destroying the plantations. On May 13, they raided Frankfort (Dresden), where two men were killed and a house burned. The same day they raided Sheepscot (Newcastle) and took five prisoners. Two people were killed in North Yarmouth on May 29 and one taken captive. The natives shot <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>at</b> Teconnet, took prisoners at Fort Halifax and two prisoners at Fort Shirley (Dresden). They also captured two workers at the fort at New Gloucester. During this period, the Maliseet and Mi'kmaq were the only tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy who were able to fight.|$|E

25|$|The {{method of}} color {{photography}} used by Prokudin-Gorsky was first suggested by James Clerk Maxwell in 1855 and demonstrated in 1861, but good results were not {{possible with the}} photographic materials available at that time. In imitation of the way a normal human eye senses color, the visible spectrum of colors was divided into three channels of information by capturing it {{in the form of}} three black-and-white photographs, one taken through a red filter, one through a green filter, and one through a blue filter. The resulting three photographs could either be projected through filters of the same colors and exactly superimposed on a screen, synthesizing the original range of color additively; viewed as an additive color image by <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>at</b> a time through an optical device known generically as a chromoscope or photochromoscope, which contained colored filters and transparent reflectors that visually combined the three into one full-color image; or used to make photographic or mechanical prints in the complementary colors cyan, magenta and yellow, which, when superimposed, reconstituted the color subtractively.|$|E

500|$|... "Hell Is Other Robots" [...] lampoons drug {{addiction}} and religious conversion. In the DVD commentary for the episode, David X. Cohen, Matt Groening and Eric Kaplan {{all agreed that}} they felt comfortable enough {{with each of the}} Futurama characters to begin to take them in new and strange directions. Cohen noted that Bender's addiction {{is a perfect example of}} something they could do with a robot character which they could not get away with had it been a human character. <b>One</b> <b>person</b> <b>at</b> the studio refused to work on this episode because they did not agree with the portrayal of some of the religious content. Cohen also noted that the writing team had begun to loosen up during this episode, which gave it a feel similar to the series' later episodes. Kaplan claimed that before editing, there was enough material to make a three-part episode.|$|E
500|$|There {{are special}} cases, {{particularly}} {{when dealing with}} copying by third parties. If the person doing the copying {{is not the one}} doing the research, different rules apply; a publisher cannot use it to justify printing parts of other publishers works, as in Sillitoe v McGraw Hill, but in order to uphold the exception's justification, the courts do recognise that it can cover a research assistant making photocopies on behalf of a student or researcher. However, as a limitation, Section 29(3)(b) provides that the copying cannot be fair dealing if the person doing it knows that it will result in [...] "copies of substantially the same material being provided to more than <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>at</b> substantially the same time and for substantially the same purpose". In other words, an academic cannot print off multiple copies of a work for students and then rely on the fair dealings exception.|$|E

500|$|Research {{and study}} {{does not apply}} to {{commercial}} research, and does not include infringements of broadcasts, sound recordings or film; it also has only a limited application to software. These exclusions have been criticised as failing [...] "to reflect the increasing importance of non-textual media for both study and research". Research cannot be private, and in a non-academic setting must also not have a future potential commercial purpose. This exception also excludes, under Section 29(3)(b) of the 1988 Act, copying which will result in [...] "copies of substantially the same material being provided to more than <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>at</b> substantially the same time and for substantially the same purpose". Criticism or review is interpreted liberally, and may include criticism or review of a work's social or moral implications or its impact, but this exception is only available when the work in question has been previously made available to the public. Reporting of current events is only an exception where the event is [...] "current", and may exclude trivial or ephemeral news; such news can, however, become an [...] "event" [...] through media coverage.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} German Ideology, Marx {{turned to}} a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding [...] "the theory and tactics" [...] of a truly [...] "revolutionary proletarian movement" [...] operating {{from the standpoint of}} a truly [...] "scientific materialist" [...] philosophy. This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx's own scientific socialist philosophy. Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>at</b> a time to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Marx knew that people would tend on most occasions to act in accordance with their own economic interests, thus appealing to an entire class (the working class in this case) with a broad appeal to the class's best material interest would {{be the best way to}} mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society. This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning, but to get the manuscript past the government censors he called the book The Poverty of Philosophy (1847) and offered it as a response to the [...] "petty bourgeois philosophy" [...] of the French anarchist socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as expressed in his book The Philosophy of Poverty (1840).|$|E
