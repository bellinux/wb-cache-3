The thesis first chapters are describing OSD, its origin and implementation. The thesis also analyzes all regulations that are connected with this matter and are focusing on the training of maintenance certifying staff. A part of this thesis deals with the description of aircraft Evektor EV- 55 Outback, for which is created the educational material, and a description of its fuel system.

40|$|Proceedings Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) This {{research}} project defines the interdependent {{relationship between a}} weapon system''s mission capabilities, O&S costs, operational utility rate, and their impacts on overall mission effectiveness of an operational combat unit. By analyzing the sub-elements of both operational effectiveness and <b>operational</b> <b>suitability</b> it can be shown how operational effectiveness is a dependent element of operation suitability. Additionally, it will be demonstrated how support costs influence <b>operational</b> <b>suitability</b> parameters of a weapon system, which then impacts a combat unit''s overall mission effectiveness. Since support costs have such a critical relationship with <b>operational</b> <b>suitability</b> factors, the project also defines the current relationships between Service Cost and T&E communities to question {{whether or not there}} is the requisite level of integration of effort between the two organizations to accurately assess weapon system costs and capability prior to production.

40|$|AbstractA {{methodology}} {{was developed}} to evaluate the <b>operational</b> <b>suitability</b> of electromobility concepts for last-mile delivery operations. Electromobility systems consisting of electric vehicles of ten weight classes and four mid-operation charging strategies were synthesized and evaluated using a hypothetical grocery outlet replenishment scenario. A system of <b>operational</b> <b>suitability</b> indicators was developed based {{on the amount of}} and efficiency of resources needed. The results highlight a strong trade-off between single-charge driving range, payload capacity, and the minimum fleet size needed. If operational performance similar to that of diesel vehicles is to be reached, mid-operation charging could be a reasonable alternative to “simply” having a bigger vehicle battery...|$|R

40|$|The {{provision}} of high-speed runway exits {{is one of}} several alternatives to increase airport runway capacity through reductions in runway occupancy time. The Runway Exit Design Interactive Model developed at Virginia Tech proposes new geometric design standards for high-speed turnoffs and an algorithm to locate optimal runway exits.

The flight simulation experiments were conducted at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City in a Boeing 727 - 200, 6 -degree-of-freedom, full-motion-base aircraft simulator.
