5|$|Château Gaillard {{consists}} of three baileys—an inner, a middle, and an outer with the main entrance to the castle—and a keep, also called a donjon, in the inner-bailey. The baileys, which were separated by rock-cut ditches, housed the castle's stables, workshops, and storage facilities. It is common for extant castles {{to be the result}} of several phases of construction, and were adapted and added to over the period of their use; however Château Gaillard essentially is the result of one period of building. The division into three wards bears similarities with the design of Château de Chinon, built by HenryII in the mid-12thcentury on a promontory <b>overlooking</b> <b>a</b> town.|$|E

5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} that Tabak had {{then tried to}} conceal the crime by disposing of her body. The court heard that DNA swabs taken from Yeates' body had provided a match with Tabak. Samples found behind the knees of her jeans indicated {{she may have been}} held by the legs as she was carried, while fibres suggested contact with Tabak's coat and car. Blood stains were found on a wall <b>overlooking</b> <b>a</b> quarry close to where Yeates was discovered. The prosecution also said that Tabak attempted to implicate Jefferies for the murder during the police investigation, and that in the days following Yeates' death, he had made internet searches for topics that included the length of time a body takes to decompose and the dates of refuse collections in the Clifton area.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with these}} constraints, the Spanish {{expedition}} {{had to cross}} the river several times and fight at each ford against stiff opposition. The bulk of the Inca army confronted the Spaniards from a set of terraces <b>overlooking</b> <b>a</b> plain by the Urubamba River. Several Spanish assaults against the terraces failed against a shower of arrows, slingshots and boulders {{coming down from the}} terraces as well as from both flanks. To hinder the efforts of the Spanish cavalry the Incas flooded the plain using previously prepared channels; water eventually reached the horses' girths. The defenders then counterattacked; some of them used Spanish weapons captured in previous encounters such as swords, bucklers, armor and even a horse, ridden by Manco Inca himself. In a severely compromised situation, Hernando Pizarro ordered a retreat; under the cover of darkness the Spanish force fled through the Urubamba valley with the Incas in pursuit and reached Cusco the next day.|$|E
5|$|Sutton Valence Castle is {{a ruined}} medieval {{fortification}} {{in the village}} of Sutton Valence in Kent, England. It was built {{in the second half of}} the 12th century, probably by Baldwin of Bethune, the Count of Aumale. <b>Overlooking</b> <b>a</b> strategic route to the coast, the original castle probably comprised an inner and an outer bailey and a protective barbican, with a three-storey high keep on its southern side. It was passed into the Marshal and de Montfort families, before being given by King Henry III to his half-brother William de Valence in 1265, from whom the castle takes its current name. It was abandoned in the early 14th century and fell into ruin. In the 21st century the castle is managed by English Heritage, and the remains of the keep are open to the public.|$|E

The blond hippie inspired character is then seen in a second setting, riding a bicycle through a grassy field at times performing dance movements to the song and lip-synching.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the raid}} on Gaba Tepe, Leane rejoined his {{battalion}} {{in the main}} defensive line around the beachhead. Before dawn on 19 May, elements of the Ottoman 16th Division attacked the 3rd Brigade positions on Bolton's Ridge {{as part of a}} wider counterattack against the Anzac sector. During the fighting, Leane was located in a forward sap of the battalion trenches <b>overlooking</b> <b>a</b> gully where the Ottoman troops were congregating. From this position, Leane and two other 11th Battalion men killed a large number of Ottoman troops with their rifles, firing from dawn until noon. On 28 June, Leane's company went forward of Bolton's Ridge towards Turkey Knoll to provide covering fire for an abortive attack by the 9th Battalion on Ottoman trenches on Sniper's Ridge. This attack was a feint, intended to distract the Ottoman commanders from reinforcing their troops opposite an Allied attack at Cape Helles far to the south. The forward company position was completely untenable, the lead elements of Leane's company were raked by shrapnel and machine gun fire, and Leane was wounded in the face. Despite this, he remained with his unit. The two companies of the 11th Battalion that were committed to support the attack lost 21 killed and 42 wounded.|$|E
