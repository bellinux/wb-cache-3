40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the design and implementation of radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers and micro-electromechanical systems [...] -namely MEMS varactors. This is driven by the many wireless communication systems which are constantly moving towards increased integration, better signal quality, and longer battery life. The power amplifier consumes most of the power in a receiver/transmitter system (transceiver), and its output signal is directly transmitted by the antenna without further modification. Thus, optimizing the PA for low power consumption, increased linearity, and compact integration is highly desirable. Micro-electromechanical systems enable new levels of performance in radio-frequency integrated circuits, which are not readily available via conventional IC technologies. They are good candidates to replace lossy, low Q-factor off-chip components, which have traditionally been used to implement matching networks or <b>output</b> <b>resonator</b> tanks in class AB, class F, or class E power amplifiers. The MEMS technologies also make possible the use of new architectures, with the possibility of flexible re-configurability and tunability for multi-band and/or multi-standard applications. The major effort of this thesis is focused on the design and fabrication of an RF frequency class AB power amplifier in the SiGe BiCMOS 5 HP technology, with the capability of being tuned with external MEMS varactors. The latter necessitated the exploration of wide-tuning range MEMS variable capacitors, with prototypes designed and fabricated in the Metal-MUMPS process.

40|$|Abstract—Exploiting the impulse-like {{nature of}} {{excitation}} {{in the sequence}} of glottal cycles, a method is proposed to derive the instantaneous fundamental frequency from speech signals. The method involves passing the speech signal through two ideal resonators located at zero frequency. A filtered signal {{is derived from the}} <b>output</b> of the <b>resonators</b> by subtracting the local mean computed over an interval corresponding to the average pitch period. The positive zero crossings in the filtered signal correspond to the locations of the strong impulses in each glottal cycle. Then the instantaneous fundamental frequency is obtained by taking the reciprocal of the interval between successive positive zero crossings. Due to filtering by zero-frequency resonator, the effects of noise and vocal-tract variations are practically eliminated. For the same reason, the method is also robust to degradation in speech due to additive noise. The accuracy of the fundamental frequency estimation by the proposed method is comparable or even better than many existing methods. Moreover, the proposed method is also robust against rapid variation of the pitch period or vocal-tract changes. The method works well even when the glottal cycles are not periodic or when the speech signals are not correlated in successive glottal cycles.

50|$|There {{will only}} be appreciable output from the optical {{resonator}} when a frequency peak from the frequency-comb laser coincides with a harmonic of the free spectral range of the cavity. In Vernier spectroscopy, {{the ratio of the}} repetition rate of the frequency comb to the free spectral range of the cavity is N/(N-1), where N is an integer, so that only every N peak of the frequency comb will satisfy the resonance condition of the optical cavity and propagate through it and the sample. This is chosen so that the two sets of resonances form a Vernier scale, giving the name to the technique. This is essential because a typical frequency comb repetition rate is on the order of radio frequencies, making the task of resolving and detecting individual frequency components difficult. If N is made to be large, then the frequency separation of the <b>resonator</b> <b>output</b> peaks will be large enough to be resolved by a simple grating spectrometer. If the length of the cavity is changed slightly, usually by a piezoelectric actuator, then the free spectral range of the cavity will also change.

Their operation can be analyzed in detail [2], and so can their output. This output consists of {{the positive and negative}} going peak amplitude of the membrane deflection d at successive half cycles of the resonant motion. Its remarkable features are sudden jumps, from one half cycle to the next, of the resonance amplitude by quantized amounts: these discrete dissipation events signal the occurrence of phase slips by 2 rr of tile quantum phase difference 0 = 99 o~t- ~i,, of the superfluid wavefunction outside and inside ttle resonator. We briefly describe the effect of trapped circulation on tile <b>resonator</b> <b>output.</b> We start with the continuity equation expressing the fact that tile volume (compressibility is neglected) swept by the membrane per unit time equals the sum of the flows through the weak link and the long channel: S{/ =. %,v ~ + s,v,. (1) The velocity is related to the gradient of the phase, v = (h/m) V ~ or, by definition of tile hydraulic length I of an orifice [3], v = hO/ml. ...|$|R
30|$|Ring {{resonators}} {{have found}} versatile functionalities in optical switching [1, 2], optical filters, photonics sensors [3, 4] and optical communications [5, 6]. The superiorities of resonating systems rather than Fabry–Perot cavities, Bragg gratings and other integrated feedback waveguide devices are in automatic pumping {{system for the}} feedback process {{and the possibility of}} jointing several waveguides into the a ring. Resonators benefit from low photon loss rate and have ability to store energy in a microsized volume [7]. These features have made the ring resonators as multipurpose components for photonics and optoelectronics. Several methods have been used to check the quality and characteristics of <b>output</b> light from <b>resonator</b> systems. These methods include critical coupling condition, over coupling [8], multiple-stage ring resonator [9], parallel coupling [10], symmetric coupling [11] and asymmetric coupling [12]. The critical coupling condition in ring resonator has been a subject of interest due to its potential application in optical communication [13, 14] and photonics sensors [15]. The add–drop ring resonators have been used as an optical notch type filter in optical networks [16, 17]. Optical filters need to be tunable for using network system. Some parameters in ring resonators are effective factors in the quality of output signals. To evaluate the functionalities of resonator-based filters, the critical coupling condition and full width at half maximum (FWHM) are considered as the key parameters in checking the quality of output signals [18, 19, 20]. In this paper, a critical coupling condition of ADR system is determined by considering the coupling loss. The behavior of the silicon–ADR system is studied under the variation of coupling coefficients and coupling factors. A visual method for checking the quality of the output signals is introduced based on the relative phase shifts of through and drop ports from ADR filter. This proposed method is applicable in signal processing, optical filters and optical communication.|$|R
