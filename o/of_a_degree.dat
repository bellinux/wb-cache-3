5|$|Apart from {{a number}} of other books and pamphlets, Wright {{translated}} John Napier's pioneering 1614 work which introduced the idea of logarithms from Latin into English. This was published after Wright's death as A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithmes (1616). Wright's work influenced, among other persons, Dutch astronomer and mathematician Willebrord Snellius; Adriaan Metius, the geometer and astronomer from Holland; and the English mathematician Richard Norwood, who calculated the length <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> on a great circle of the earth using a method proposed by Wright.|$|E
5|$|Praseodymium alloyed with nickel (PrNi5) {{has such}} a strong magnetocaloric effect that it has allowed {{scientists}} to approach within one thousandth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> of absolute zero. In general, most alloys of the cerium-group rare earths (lanthanum through samarium) with 3d transition metals give extremely stable magnets that are often used in small equipment, such as motors, printers, watches, headphones, loudspeakers, and magnetic storage.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} conditions have been significantly altered {{from the original}} conditions {{by the presence of}} life-forms, which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods, and variations <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.|$|E

5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, light does not travel along {{straight}} lines when it propagates in a gravitational field. Instead, it is deflected {{in the presence}} of massive bodies. In particular, starlight is deflected as it passes near the Sun, leading to apparent shifts of up 1.75 arc seconds in the stars' positions in the sky (an arc second is equal to 1/3600 <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree).</b> In the framework of Newtonian gravity, a heuristic argument can be made that leads to light deflection by half that amount. The different predictions can be tested by observing stars that are close to the Sun during a solar eclipse. In this way, a British expedition to West Africa in 1919, directed by Arthur Eddington, confirmed that Einstein's prediction was correct, and the Newtonian predictions wrong, via observation of the May 1919 eclipse. Eddington's results were not very accurate; subsequent observations of the deflection of the light of distant quasars by the Sun, which utilize highly accurate techniques of radio astronomy, have confirmed Eddington's results with significantly better precision (the first such measurements date from 1967, the most recent comprehensive analysis from 2004).|$|E
5|$|In the 5th century CE, the Indian astronomical text Surya Siddhanta {{estimated}} the angular size of Mars as 2arc-minutes (1/30 <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree)</b> and its distance to Earth as 10,433,000km (1,296,600yojana, where one yojana {{is equivalent to}} eightkm in the Surya Siddhanta). From this the diameter of Mars is deduced to be 6,070km (754.4 yojana), which has an error within 11% of the currently accepted value of 6,788km. However, this estimate was based upon an inaccurate guess of the planet's angular size. The result may {{have been influenced by}} the work of Ptolemy, who listed a value of 1.57 arc-minutes. Both estimates are significantly larger than the value later obtained by telescope.|$|E
5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E

5|$|The {{oldest and}} most precise method of X-ray {{crystallography}} is single-crystal X-ray diffraction, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a single crystal, producing scattered beams. When they land {{on a piece of}} film or other detector, these beams make a diffraction pattern of spots; the strengths and angles of these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated. Each spot is called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, X-ray diffraction data can determine the mean chemical bond lengths and angles to within a few thousandths of an angstrom and to within a few tenths <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree,</b> respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a few tenths of an angstrom. X-ray crystallography allows measuring the size of these oscillations.|$|E
5|$|Municipalities in Rhode Island can {{incorporate}} as a town or city {{by a special}} act of the state legislature {{and there is no}} minimum population requirement. Eight municipalities were reincorporated as cities operating under a charter, while the other thirtyone remain as towns which perform similar services. Since Rhode Island has no county level of government, cities and towns provide services commonly performed by county governments in other states. Rhode Island's cities and towns may adopt one of four different forms of government: councilmanager, mayorcouncil, town counciltown meeting, or administratorcouncil. The primary difference between these forms of government is how the chief executive is selected. The Councilmanager system involves an elected council who exercise overall control of the local government and a chief executive termed city or town manager who is generally appointed by and responsible to the council for the administration of local policies. Councilmanager systems may elect a mayor but they have no formal administrative functions with the potential exception <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> of veto power. Mayorcouncil systems have a similarly elected council however the mayor is elected and yields administrative power. In the town counciltown meeting system, there is no fulltime chief executive. There are no towns or cities in Rhode Island that use the administratorcouncil form of government.|$|E
