5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way <b>of</b> <b>treating</b> {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the impact of biofield energy treatment on the physical, thermal and spectral properties of 3 -NAP. The study was performed in two groups i. e. control and treated. The control group remained as untreated, and the treated group received Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment. The control and treated 3 -NAP samples were further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), laser particle size analyzer, surface area analyzer, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and ultra violet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) analysis. The XRD analysis showed decrease in crystallite size <b>of</b> <b>treated</b> 3 -NAP by 20. 27 % as compared to the control sample. However, the XRD peaks <b>of</b> <b>treated</b> sample showed an increase in intensity as compared to the control. The DSC result showed a slight increase in melting temperature <b>of</b> <b>treated</b> 3 -NAP (80. 75 ºC) with respect to the control (79. 39 ºC). The latent heat <b>of</b> fusion <b>of</b> <b>treated</b> 3 -NAP was changed by 16. 28 % as compared to the control sample. The TGA analysis showed an increase in onset temperature <b>of</b> <b>treated</b> sample (192 ºC) as compared to the control sample (182 ºC). Further, the maximum thermal decomposition temperature (Tmax) <b>of</b> <b>treated</b> 3 -NAP was increased as compared to the control. This showed the increase in thermal stability <b>of</b> <b>treated</b> 3 -NAP with respect to control. The treated 3 -NAP showed an increase in average particle size (d 50) by 27. 6 % along with an increase in size exhibited by 99 % of particles (d 99) by 4. 9 % as compared to the control. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis showed a substantial decrease in surface area by 24. 6 % with respect to the control.
