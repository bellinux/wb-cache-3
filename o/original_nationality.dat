25|$|In December 2008, a new {{proposal}} {{was presented to}} the Dutch Lower House of Parliament, and in January 2010 Legislative bill 31.831 (R1873) passed a majority vote amending the Kingdom Act on the Netherlands nationality to allow the so-called 'latent Dutch' to opt to receive Dutch nationality, regardless of their current age and marital status, and without requirement to renounce their <b>original</b> <b>nationality.</b> In June 2010, the Dutch Upper House approved the legislation. It was signed into law in July 2010 by Minister of Justice Mr Hirsch Ballin and H.M. the Queen, and published in the official Gazette issued by the Dutch Government (Staatsblad van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden), with effect 1 October 2010. Latent Dutch now have the opportunity to receive Dutch nationality by option. Many latent Dutch regard themselves as having been Dutch since birth. However, while latent Dutch are by definition descended from a Dutch mother, nationality granted through the option procedure is not retroactive to the date of their birth. Under the law, these individuals are not considered to be Dutch since birth (van rechtswege), but rather are legally ‘Dutch by option’ from the date that the requirements of the ‘option procedure’ are fulfilled.|$|E

40|$|With {{a steady}} growth of {{immigration}} in Finland, the current number of immigrants has reached nearly 6 % {{of the total}} population. These immigrants have crossed cultural boundaries for a new home and better life in Finland, but often face the compound challenges of navigating a new culture while striving to function efficiently in an unfamiliar environment. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study is to investigate new immigrants’ acculturation in Finland. Previous studies have been focused on either refugees or returnees, so this study aims to produce an inclusive investigation of acculturation of on both forced and voluntary immigrants, as well as returnees who have engaged in the official integration plan in Finland. A total of eleven new immigrants were interviewed face-to face. The interview questions explored the general status of the immigrants prior to migration, their adjustment and adaptation in the host society, acculturative stress, the preference of acculturation strategy, and transformation reported through their individual experience and interaction with the host population during the initial phase of the migration process. The results of this study identified the acculturative stressors as Finnish language deficiency, employment, and dealing with the medical system. Discrimination was not considered as a significant issue. The preferred acculturation strategy was integration strategy among the participants. In the associated matter of the individual’s cultural identity, the <b>original</b> background and <b>nationality</b> were the most important factor. The individuals’ transformations of cultural schemas were modified depending on the cultural context, individual background, and societal characteristics...|$|R

40|$|The {{case of the}} {{translations}} of Lithuanian poetess Judita Vaičiūnaitė (1937 – 2001) early poetry into Russian clearly illustrates the damages an original literary text (and the author’s institution) bore seeking to gain a statewide readership. In this article the Soviet translational practice of the 1960 s is discussed as a phenomenon typical of Soviet literature when intentional rewriting, expurgation and ideological remakes of the authorial text {{were considered to be}} normal. The lowered horizons when translating the minor <b>nationality’s</b> <b>original</b> poetry, notable ideological inversions {{and the use of the}} source text in the most general scheme of the plot in Vaičiūnaitė’s early poetry translations into Russian, and even intimacy used in favour of ideological records marked not only the weakness and incompetence of amateur translators but also the pressure of the censoring institutions upon the author. The invisible chains of Soviet literary patronage demonstrated that the aesthetic value of the original and its translations for the publishing and propaganda industry of that time were of secondary importance. Wishing to spread their work to the wider circle of the Soviet readers and to strengthen the symbolic power, most often authors used to agree to the substitutions and editorial interventions into the authorial text. The interactions between the propagandist-educational character of the {{translations of}} that time and the artistic aims of the translational process in Soviet literary criticism were discussed later, after the revision of the Soviet heritage, evaluating the role of literature as a servant of the Soviet power machine. The fact that Vaičiūnaitė publicly never mentioned her early poetry translations into Russian reveals her attitude towards the prevalent translational practice: it was negatory as well as instrumental. Having agreed with the imprints of the Soviet literary patronage on the translations of her texts, she took the step gaining personal legitimisation in the state-wide Soviet literary universe...|$|R

50|$|The {{nationality}} of Burda {{is often}} difficult to determine because country boundaries change over time, leaving the <b>original</b> <b>nationality</b> a mystery. The original ethnicity of Burda may be difficult to determine especially because it was common for a last name to change as it enters a new country or language.

Some research suggests that the surname may come even from the Scandinavian countries such as Norway. It is assumed that the name Burda is probably old Slavic derivative form of Germanic surname. Today, surname is most commonly found in different Slavic countries such as northern Poland, the Czech Republic and western Ukraine, as a result of centuries-old migration of the European population.|$|E

50|$|Article 4d {{provides}} that neither marriage nor {{dissolution of marriage}} shall automatically affect the nationality of either spouse, nor shall a change of nationality by one spouse during marriage automatically affect the nationality of their spouse. Common practice among states {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century was that a woman was to have the nationality of her husband; i.e., upon marrying a foreigner the wife would automatically acquire the nationality of her husband, and lose her previous nationality. Even after the nationality of a married woman was no longer dependent on the nationality of her husband, legal provisions were still retained which automatically naturalised married women, and sometimes married men as well. This led to a number of problems, such as loss of the spouses' <b>original</b> <b>nationality,</b> the spouse losing the right to consular assistance (since consular assistance cannot be provided to nationals under the jurisdiction of a foreign state of which they are also nationals), and becoming subject to military service obligations. Article 4d addresses this situation.|$|E
