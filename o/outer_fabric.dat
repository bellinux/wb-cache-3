25|$|Aesthetic {{appearance}} is {{of paramount importance}} for modern pointe shoes. To achieve an elegant appearance, the shoe's more decorative <b>outer</b> <b>fabric</b> is prominently featured, covering the maximum possible area of the shoe's visible surfaces. To this end, the sole is made of thin material to give it a minimal profile, and a margin of satin is artfully pleated around it so that the sole covers only part of the bottom of the shoe.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{the jacket}} of a suit, between the <b>outer</b> <b>fabric</b> {{and the inner}} lining, there is a layer of sturdy {{interfacing}} fabric to prevent the wool from stretching out of shape; this layer of cloth is called the canvas after the fabric from which it was traditionally made. Expensive jackets have a floating canvas, while cheaply manufactured models have a fused (glued) canvas. A fused canvas is less soft and, if poorly done, damages the suppleness and durability of the jacket, so many tailors are quick to deride fused canvas as being less durable, particularly since they may tend to permanently pucker along the jacket's edges after some use or a few dry cleanings. However, some selling this type of jacket claim that the difference in quality is very small. A few London tailors state that all bespoke suits should use a floating canvas.|$|E
30|$|Lining fabrics are {{typically}} {{made in a}} lighter weight and smoother texture than the <b>outer</b> shell <b>fabric.</b> Generally, the lining fabrics do not stretch, but occasionally, a stretchable garment will be lined with a stretch lining fabric (Knowles 2006). If the degree of stretch in the lining fabric {{is less than the}} <b>outer</b> shell <b>fabric,</b> the lining pattern size is increased from the outer shell pattern (Kim and Suh 2007). The amount of increase in overall size for non-stretch fabric lining patterns from the non-stretch outer shell patterns results in a pattern piece larger than the non-stretch <b>outer</b> shell <b>fabric.</b> The non-stretch <b>outer</b> shell pattern size is larger than the stretch <b>outer</b> shell <b>fabric</b> pattern size to accommodate for more ease in the garment.|$|R
30|$|The term “lining” {{refers to}} any fabric {{used on the}} inside of a garment, and is {{different}} from the <b>outer</b> shell <b>fabric</b> (Knowles 2006). Even though the lining is placed inside of the garment, the size of the lining needs to be larger than the outer shell, so as not to cling to the outer shell nor disturb it. Appropriate ease in the lining pattern is necessary, otherwise the lining will pull or disrupt the <b>outer</b> shell <b>fabric.</b> Therefore, developing a lining pattern {{is as important as the}} patternmaking of the <b>outer</b> shell <b>fabric.</b>|$|R
25|$|During {{the first}} two decades of the 19th century, fashions {{continued}} to follow the basic high-waisted empire silhouette, but in other respects neoclassical influences became progressively diluted. Dresses remained narrow in front, but fullness at the raised back waist allowed room to walk. Colors other than white came into style, the fad for diaphanous <b>outer</b> <b>fabrics</b> faded (except in certain formal contexts), and some elements of obvious visible ornamentation came back into use {{in the design of}} the dress (as opposed to the elegant simplicity or subtle white-on-white embroidery of the dress of ca. 1800).|$|R
2500|$|The other primary type of wear {{involves}} the exterior fabric. In pointe work the front face and bottom {{edge of the}} toe box are subjected to friction against the performance surface. This friction will eventually wear through the shoe's <b>outer</b> <b>fabric</b> covering, thereby exposing the toe box and creating loose, frayed fabric edges. Unlike a weakened shank, damaged <b>outer</b> <b>fabric</b> {{does not affect the}} performance of a shoe. Due to its unprofessional appearance, however, damaged fabric may render the shoe unfit to wear in situations other than informal practice or rehearsal.|$|E

30|$|First, in general, {{menswear}} brands {{provide the}} pants lining pattern to the factory. The pant style (suit or casual) and the <b>outer</b> shell <b>fabric’s</b> degree of stretch were important factors {{with regards to}} the patternmaking method of the pants lining. The sewing method of pants lining has several steps. For example, attaching the lining <b>fabric</b> onto the <b>outer</b> shell <b>fabric</b> using an overlocking stitch must be done first. Then, the sewing of both layers together can be done to construct the remainder of the pant. Interestingly, it was noted that the direction of the grain line was crosswise instead of lengthwise for the lining fabric.|$|R
40|$|During the Apollo program, {{the space}} suit <b>outer</b> layer <b>fabrics</b> were badly abraded {{after just a}} few Extravehicular Activities (EVAs). For example, the Apollo 12 {{commander}} reported abrasive wear on the boots, which penetrated the <b>outer</b> layer <b>fabric</b> into the thermal protection layers after less than eight hours of surface operations. Current plans for the Constellation Space Suit Element require the space suits to support hundreds of hours of EVA on the Lunar surface, creating a challenge for space suit designers to utilize materials advances made over the last forty years and improve upon the space suit fabrics used in the Apollo program. A test methodology has been developed by the NASA Johnson Space Center Crew and Thermal Systems Division for establishing comparative abrasion wear characteristics between various candidate space suit <b>outer</b> layer <b>fabrics.</b> The abrasion test method incorporates a large rotary drum tumbler with rocks and loose lunar simulant material to induce abrasion in fabric test cylinder elements, representative of what might occur during long term planetary surface EVAs. Preliminary materials screening activities were conducted to determine the degree of wear on representative space suit outer layer materials and the corresponding dust permeation encountered between subsequent sub -layers of thermal protective materials when exposed to a simulated worst case eight hour EVA. The test method was used to provide a preliminary evaluation of four candidate <b>outer</b> layer <b>fabrics</b> for future planetary surface space suit applications. This Paper provides a review of previous abrasion studies on space suit fabrics, details the methodologies used for abrasion testing in this particular study, and shares the results and conclusions of the testing...|$|R

A chin radiator was mounted below the fuselage firewall, with a long, prominent fairing behind it. The engine mountings were extended rearwards beyond the pilot's cabin {{to join the}} steel tubes in the wings. [...] The cabin, fitted with dual controls, was accessed via glazed triangular doors, which provided sufficient sideways vision for cruising flight. A hatch, provided with a small windscreen was used for take-offs and landings by raising the pilot's seat. [...] The navigator sat alongside the pilot on a drop seat. His space, 2m (79in) long and 1m (39in) wide, had side and roof windows for sightings. Internally, the rear part of the fuselage, mounted {{on the other end}} of the wing's four steel tubes, provided a space for the crew to rest during a long flight. The aerodynamically clean, tapered, elliptical rear section was built around four longerons, with a plywood skin and <b>outer</b> <b>fabric</b> sheath. [...] The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and the fin and rudder together were roughly elliptical. [...] The fixed, tailwheel undercarriage had split axles hinged to the bottom of the fuselage, with the wheels and main legs enclosed in narrow, wide chord fairings.|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is devoted to further understanding heat transfer through clothing under different circumstances, {{in order to provide}} guidelines for the design and construction of clothing with regard to thermal comfort. In one part of this work, studies were concentrated on the clothing thermal insulation in windy conditions. In this part, a newly designed cylindrical togmeter and a theoretical model have been developed. The numerical solution derived from the theoretical model agrees well with the experimental findings from the cylindrical togmeter in a wind tunnel. The heat transfer mechanisms involved in the wind induced reduction of clothing thermal insulation have been better understood by examining the experimental and theoretical results. The effects of wind velocity, air permeability and stiffness of the <b>outer</b> <b>fabrics,</b> air permeability and thickness of the inner fibrous battings, and the dimensions of the human body on the clothing thermal insulation have also been examined and discussed. Furthermore, based on the understanding of the mechanism of air penetration into permeable clothing assemblies, methods have been proposed for the design and construction of wind resistant protective clothing by using permeable <b>outer</b> <b>fabrics.</b> These methods were evaluated on the cylindrical togmeter and are believed to have important practical values. The other part of this work was focused on the development and laboratory use of a fabric manikin. The "skin" of the manikin was made of coated water-proof fabric, and heated water was circulated inside the "body". The arms and legs of the manikin could be moved to simulate walking. The manikin was very cheap to construct when compared with that of a copper manikin and can be widely applied for routine tests for outdoor and military garments subject to some modifications in its design. With this fabric manikin, a series of experiments have been conducted to investigate the effects of body motion, clothing design and environmental conditions on the thermal insulation of clothing. Some useful information for the design of functional clothing and for the prediction of the thermal stress of a clothed person in different environmental conditions has been provided through this investigation...|$|R
30|$|The {{construction}} {{method that}} connected a lining <b>fabric</b> to the <b>outer</b> shell <b>fabric</b> was separate over-locking sewing steps (the front lining was overlocked to front outer shell, the back was overlocked {{to the back}} outer shell), then all were sewn together (84.6 %, 11 out of 13). The important factors {{on the length of}} the lining pattern were “the comfortableness on the knee area” (53.8 %, 7 out of 13) and “product cost by fabric consumption” (30.8 %, 4 out of 13).|$|R
30|$|As {{illustrated}} above, most menswear brands {{provided the}} pants lining pattern to the garment factories. The pants style (suit pants and casual pants), {{as well as}} both circumference and length ease were important factors. The connecting method was overlocking the lining <b>fabric</b> onto the <b>outer</b> shell <b>fabric.</b> The direction of the lining fabric used was crosswise grain line, which {{is in contrast to}} the information for the womenswear manufacturers and designers. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} could be a great asset for new menswear and womenswear manufacturers and fashion designers.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the proper amount of hip ease in the skirt lining. We carried out a wear test comparing the skirts that differed in hip ease. The <b>outer</b> <b>fabrics</b> were denim and jersey，which were equal in thickness，and bemberg taffeta was used for the 	lining fabric. The amount of hip ease in the skirt was 2 cm， 6 cm and 10 cm ease for the outer 	fabrics，and 0 cm to 10 cm ease for the lining. Six female subjects were asked to judge the 	single and combination of skirts with regard to garment fit at 14 different positions and 	overall comfort. The wearers graded fit and comfort on a scale from - 2 to + 2. 	There were significant differences in overall comfort between the outer fabrics，the hip 	ease of outer skirts and that of skirt lining. When the amount of hip ease was 2 cm for the 	outer skirts，the subjects felt tightness，regardless of hip ease in the lining. However，they felt 	comfortable or moderately loose over 6 cm ease for the lining on condition that the amount 	of hip ease was 6 cm or 10 cm ease for the outer skirts. 	As the amount of hip ease increased，the additional inner space created by the lining in the jersey skirts.

30|$|The {{moisture}} barrier {{is a light}} weight web or knitted structure either coated or laminated to the inner side of the <b>outer</b> shell <b>fabric.</b> This layer is loosely inserted between the outer layer and the thermal barrier. The {{moisture barrier}} provides additional protection against water and many common liquids such as liquid chemicals and blood-borne pathogens. In some countries this layer is mandatory, whereas in some countries it is not preferred due to the thermal discomfort. The moisture barrier can be a hydrophilic or mimicroporous membrane. The commercial names include GoreTex®, Crosstech®, TetraTex®, Porelle®, Proline®, Vapro®, Steadair 2000 ®, Sympatex®, Action® and NeoGuard®.|$|R

50|$|The common {{color for}} the <b>outer</b> <b>fabric</b> was black, {{while for the}} inner, black, green, or red were used. Sometimes dark blue, purple, maroon, light violet, light green {{were used for the}} outer and a yellow colored fabric was used for the inner. The bordered fur was usually black, dark brown or dark blue in color, and the tassels were pink or a bright pink color. The nambawi for females were colorfully and luxuriously adorned with geumbak (gold leaf decoration) of cranes, butterflies, chrysanthemums, and phoenix or other auspicious patterns.|$|E
30|$|Another {{approach}} {{to improve the}} fire resistance of a woven fabric is to apply an FR coating to the <b>outer</b> cover <b>fabric</b> or fire barrier fabric. These coatings are attractive to the manufacturer {{as they can be}} applied to almost any fiber/fabric type. FR-treated fabrics only retard or delay the spread of flames as long as treatment chemicals are retained in the fabric. FR protection may be lost due to wear and tear. Some FR-coated barrier materials are functional for a short time but have serious drawbacks, including separation of the coating from the knitted substrate followed by balling up under the upholstery fabric and complete disintegration over {{a short period of time}} ([Anon 2999]).|$|R
30|$|Barrier {{materials}} are usually textiles {{that take the}} form of either an individual component or a layer within a composite of laminated layers. Depending upon the type of barrier material selected, a double upholstery process may be required. However, the use of a barrier material may facilitate the exchangeability of <b>outer</b> cover <b>fabrics.</b> Where barrier {{materials are}} not used, fire performance may be drastically affected by generic changes, cover fabrics, and other furniture components. In addition, the use of barrier material may result in other trade-offs. For example, highly FR–and more expensive–cushioning materials may not be required. Also, FR treatments of cover fabrics may be unnecessary where appropriate fire blockers are used.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} thermal protection and moisture transmission of firefighter clothing and how combinations of materials influence the thermal protection and moisture transmission. An orthogonal design is applied for planning the experiment. Eight different material combinations, which simulate three-layer firefighter protective clothing system, are studied. The thermal protective performance (TPP) and water vapor transmission rate of combinations are tested. The experiment data are discussed by analysis of range and variance. Meanwhile, influence of each layer on clothing performance is also studied. Results show that <b>outer</b> shell <b>fabric</b> and moisture barrier layer have significant effects on TPP and moisture transmission property, respectively.

50|$|Gore-Tex is {{typically}} placed between an <b>outer</b> <b>fabric</b> and an inner lining. The material allows moisture to pass easily from one layer through the next, {{a process known}} as wicking. This, and a polymer coating that increases the ability of the fabric to repel water, reduce the chance that the wearer will become damp, cold, or a victim of heat loss. In 1989, Gore began to license manufacturers to use the Gore-Tex material and label: however, products must survive rigorous testing in the Gore company's rain room, abrasion tests and washing machines to be authorized for market release.|$|E

The wings were {{built around a}} single spar with a forward, plywood skinned torsion box {{between it and the}} leading edge; behind the spar the wing was fabric covered. The tips carried the small sreamlined bodies known as salmons, common at the time. The outer panels carried wooden slotted ailerons which were ply skinned but with an <b>outer</b> <b>fabric</b> covering.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, the car coat was {{an item of}} leisurewear, rather than simply a {{motoring}} accessory, and was being produced {{in a variety of}} fabrics, including sheepskin and the new manmade fur varieties. A fashion writer describing the uses of faux fur said: [...] "Apart from coats they are made into all kinds of leisure wear, of which the now ubiquitous car coat is a conspicuous example. Derived from the more expensive but still popular sheepskin jacket, it is usually made from a cotton suedette or brushed nylon <b>outer</b> <b>fabric</b> lined with an acrylic pile".|$|E
30|$|In addition, the {{researchers}} analyzed {{the process of}} how to combine the lining and <b>outer</b> shell <b>fabrics,</b> along with manufacturing the pocket and darts on the pants. There were two cases of construction methods found for these areas of the pants. In the first case, after stitching the lining to the outer shell by using an overlocking stitch, manufacturers sewed two layers (lining and outer shell) of the darts and pocket. This method of construction was not expected and was done for a lower manufacturing price. In the second case, the sewing of the darts and pocket {{of the outer shell}} and the lining were done separately, then the lining piece was attached to the outer shell at the waistline.|$|R
30|$|In general, most {{menswear}} brands {{provide the}} pants lining pattern to the subcontractor (69.2 %, 9 out of 13 surveyed). This result was {{in contrast to}} that of Korean womenswear companies, where only 20 % of such companies provided the pants lining pattern to the subcontractor (Lee and Suh 2008). It was most crucial {{to determine if the}} lining manufacturing methods of pants were for suit pants or casual pants (53.8 %, 7 out of 13), rather than determining the degree of the <b>outer</b> shell <b>fabric’s</b> stretch capability (38.5 %, 5 out of 13). The most important part to developing the pants lining pattern was “all circumference and length” (53.8 %, 7 out of 13) and “length ease” (30.8 %, 4 out of 13).|$|R
30|$|Fire {{blocking}} technologies operate by two broad, {{not mutually}} exclusive modes: passive and active ([Nurbakhsh & Mc Cormack 1998]). As the term suggests, passive fire barriers are predominantly non-reactive and do not become chemically involved in the flames. Their effectiveness derives from serving as a physical and/or thermal barrier between {{some or all of}} the fuel and the potential ignition source. These passive technologies prevent or delay the ignition of interior cushioning materials; however, they do not prevent burning of the <b>outer</b> cover <b>fabric.</b> Passive fire barriers are usually made from inorganic or inherently fire resistant organic fibers. Inherently fire resistant fibers used in this technology have high heat capacity and undergo an endothermic phase change in the presence of heat.|$|R
