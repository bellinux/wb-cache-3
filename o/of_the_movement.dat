5|$|Criticising {{mainstream}} Western {{education as}} counterproductive to the ethos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement,</b> many New Age groups have established their own {{schools for the}} education of children, although in other cases such groups have sought to introduce New Age spiritual techniques into pre-existing establishments.|$|E
5|$|Media {{coverage}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> {{has focused}} on popular leaders, such as Hensley, and the deaths of ministers by snakebite have received particular attention. Practitioners of snake handling continue to view Hensley as a great man. Kimbrough recorded a discussion with an advocate of snake handling who dismissed Hensley's personal failings as slanderous fabrications. His advocacy, leadership, and– in particular– his personal charisma were important factors in the advancement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{battle for}} Mogadishu {{followed}} {{in the first half}} of 2006 in which the ARPCT confronted the ICU. However, with local support, the ICU captured the city in June of the year. It then expanded its area of control in south-central Somalia over the following months, assisted militarily by Eritrea. In an effort at reconciliation, TFG and ICU representatives held several rounds of talks in Khartoum under the auspices of the Arab League. The meetings ended unsuccessfully due to uncompromising positions retained by both parties. Hardline Islamists subsequently gained power within the ICU, prompting fears of a Talibanization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bondfield {{remained}} {{active in}} NUGMW affairs until 1938, {{and during the}} Second World War carried out investigations for the Women's Group on Public Welfare.

5|$|Carpenter {{supported}} {{the movement for}} the higher education of women, and had always {{supported the}} feminist cause {{but for most of}} her life would not do so publicly, believing that the unpopularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> for women's suffrage might damage her educational and penal reforms. But she did in 1877, the year of her death, appear on a public platform in Bristol, supporting the Bristol and West of England Society for Women’s Suffrage.

Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures. The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.|$|E
