5|$|In 1732, John Strachan built Redland Court for John Cossins. It now forms {{one of the}} {{buildings}} making up Redland High School for Girls. In 1760, the Bristol Bridge Act was carried through parliament by the Bristol MP Sir Jarrit Smyth. That led to the demolition of St Nicholas's Gate, along with the original St Nicholas church, part of the Old Shambles, and thirty houses that stood on the old bridge. The original bridge was a medieval wooden structure, lined with houses on both sides. A 17th-century illustration shows that these were five stories high, including the attic rooms, and that they <b>overhung</b> the river much as Tudor houses would overhang the street. At {{the time of the}} Civil War the bridge was noted for its community of goldsmiths, who may have been attracted by the unusually secure premises. The current St Nicholas church was rebuilt in 1762–9 by James Bridges and Thomas Paty, who rebuilt the spire. Part of the old church and town wall survives in the 14th century crypt.|$|E
5|$|In a motte-and-bailey design, {{a castle}} {{would include a}} mound called a motte, usually artificially {{constructed}} by piling up turf and soil, and a bailey, a lower walled enclosure. A keep and a protective wall would usually be built {{on top of the}} motte. Some protective walls around a keep would be large enough to have a wall-walk around them, and the outer walls of the motte and the wall-walk could be strengthened by filling in the gap between the wooden walls with earth and stones, allowing it to carry more weight – this was called a garillum. Smaller mottes could only support simple towers with room for a few soldiers, whilst larger mottes could be equipped with a much grander keep. Many wooden keeps were designed with a bretasche, a square structure that <b>overhung</b> from the upper floors of the building, enabling better defences and a more sturdy structural design. These wooden keeps could be protected by skins and hides to prevent them being easily set alight during a siege.|$|E

25|$|The image above shows {{two ways}} in which the voice coil is {{immersed}} in the magnetic field. The most common method is the <b>overhung</b> design where the height of the voice coil is greater than the magnetic gap's height. The underhung design which is used mostly in high-end speakers has the coil's height smaller than the gap's. The differences, advantages and disadvantages of both methods are listed below.|$|E
25|$|The pilot's open cockpit {{was under}} the wing cut-out; the {{observer}} sat close behind in a cockpit equipped with twin machine guns on a Scarff ring type mounting. The fin of the C.101 was triangular and broad chord and the rudder had a straight, vertical edge which extended down to the keel. As the rectangular plan tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage, the balanced, <b>overhung</b> elevators had a cut-out for rudder movement. The C.101 had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, with its mainwheels on a single axle which was sprung from V-form struts.|$|E
25|$|The {{west coast}} of Little Sark is rocky, {{but there are two}} notable beaches to the north and east. The beach of Pot Bay {{stretches}} along the east coast from north of Brenière to Avocat Point, but this is a minor attraction compared to La Grande Grève, Sark's largest and most popular beach, which lies along the north coast of Little Sark and is normally accessible via steps cut in La Coupée (after a landslip temporarily closed the steps down to the shore a second way down has now (2016) been prepared and is usable). There are also popular swimming spots at the Venus Pool and Adonis Pool. The former (or Venus's Bath, as it is also known), named as such by Victorian artist William Toplis, lies close to the southeasternmost point of Little Sark. Protected and <b>overhung</b> by granite cliffs, it is largely free from prevailing winds and is a fine swimming spot. Completely covered by the sea at high tide, a low tide a circular pool originally some eighteen feet (five metres) deep (recent rockfalls have decreased its depth substantially) is separated from the sea. A smaller pool, Cupid's Bath, is also found nearby. The Adonis Pool is a similar tidal pool, though deeper, larger and less easily accessible than the Venus Pool; it is located close to the southwesternmost tip of Little Sark. The Adonis Pool enjoys longer periods of sunshine then the Venus Pool but is separated from the mainland at anything approaching half tide (the pool is covered by the sea at high tide) by a deep and fast flowing race of water where visitors require experience or careful instruction to cross to the Adonis rock safely.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} transfer, Grant began his {{campaign}} to capture Vicksburg and open the Mississippi River. After the initial failure of his traditional overland approach, he devised several plans aimed at bypassing the fixed defenses of the city. One of these {{became known as the}} Steele's Bayou Expedition. Mound City, now commanded by Lieutenant Commander Byron Wilson, {{was a member of a}} flotilla that attempted to reach the Yazoo River through a web of bayous, sloughs, creeks, and rivers. Porter himself accompanied the expedition and made the important decisions. Progress was slow because of the tight turns in the narrow streams, the trees that <b>overhung</b> the channels, and willow roots that clung to the hulls of the vessels as they attempted to pass; they were brought to a complete halt by Confederate soldiers who felled trees in the intended path. Unable to dislodge the enemy, Porter ordered a retreat, but then found that a party of Rebels had circled behind him and were cutting him off. Porter sent an immediate appeal for help to Grant, and then had his subordinates prepare to destroy their vessels rather than let them fall into enemy hands. The appeal was passed on to Major General William T. Sherman, commanding the Fifteenth Army Corps and already in the vicinity. He ordered two of his regiments forward immediately, and they met up with Porter's flotilla on the afternoon of 21 March. Sherman himself accompanied a larger body of troops that arrived in the enemy's rear the next day. The surprised Confederate soldiers immediately fled. Although the expedition was no longer opposed by the Rebels, Porter and Sherman concluded that nothing would be gained by resuming the advance. Accordingly, the retreat continued, and the flotilla was back on the Mississippi on 27 March.|$|E
500|$|Both {{flights of}} 56 Squadron {{took off from}} {{their side of the}} trench lines at 17:00 hours. They climbed into a sky <b>overhung</b> with a 300meter (1,000feet) thick cloud ceiling at 2,700meters (9,000feet) altitude, and crossed the lines over Bixschoote at 2,400meters (8,000feet). McCudden later noted there were lower {{scattered}} layered skeins of clouds, but horizontal visibility was fair. On the other hand, he saw ground visibility was veiled by haze. He also noted friendly aircraft swarming to the north as his flight approached the Battle of Passchendaele. Indeed, there were elements of at least eight Royal Flying Corps squadrons waging its offensive campaign over the battlefield. There was also considerable enemy air activity in the east, where German jastas waited for [...] "the customers to come into the shop". The overcast compressed air activity into lower levels instead of allowing its usual altitude range to about 6,000meters (20,000feet).|$|E

[...] The American Journal of Numismatics described the Shield nickel as [...] "the ugliest of all known coins". The rays were eliminated from the reverse design in 1867, in the hope of eliminating some of the production problems. The design change created confusion among the population—many people assumed that one design or the other was a counterfeit—and the Mint briefly considered abandoning the shield design entirely. After heavy production in its first years, by late 1869, enough nickels had been struck {{to meet the needs of}} commerce; fewer were coined in the following years.|$|E
500|$|The {{space between}} the rails was , and the {{carriages}} <b>overhung</b> the outside rails by [...] Pressed {{against the side of}} the carriage, the remaining gap was just enough for Huskisson and Holmes to escape without injury, but Huskisson misjudged the distance. According to Edward Littleton, the Duke of Wellington said to Huskisson [...] "We seem to be going on—you had better step in!". Huskisson tried to clamber into the carriage, but those inside failed to reach him to pull him in. Holmes, still pressed against the carriage, shouted [...] "For God's sake, Mr Huskisson, be firm", but Huskisson grabbed the door of the carriage. With Holmes still pressed {{against the side of the}} carriage, the door, with Huskisson hanging on to it, swung out directly into the path of Rocket. Rocket collided with the door and Huskisson fell onto the track in front of the locomotive.|$|E
500|$|A [...] {{flight deck}} was built above the stern and {{stretched}} {{forward to the}} rebuilt aft superstructure. The flight deck was [...] wide at its forward end and [...] at the stern.

They could launch aircraft up to [...] in weight and required 30 seconds to launch each aircraft. The flight deck had eight permanent storage positions connected by rails to the catapults and the hydraulically operated aircraft lift that brought the aircraft up from the hangar below on the trolleys used to move the floatplanes about. Two aircraft were intended to be stowed on the catapults and three more in temporary positions on the flight deck for a total of thirteen.|$|E
500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1873–74, a small {{superstructure}} was built aft of the barbette and an enclosed wheelhouse was built atop it. In addition, {{the shape of the}} forward superstructure was modified so that it <b>overhung</b> the bow, and prominent bridge wings were added. A telescoping boom for a spar torpedo was fitted at the same time. In 1875, the ship made a port visit to Taganrog, and hosted Sir Edward Reed during a cruise along the Crimean coast that October.

The rays were eliminated from the design in early 1867, in the hopes of eliminating some of the production problems. The transition to the new design was to occur on February 1, 1867, but it is likely the mint used up the remaining dies with the old design in the interest of economy.

500|$|A {{spectacular}} fête {{was held}} {{during the reign}} of Catherine’s son Henry III to celebrate the marriage of his sister-in-law, Marguerite of Lorraine, to his favourite, Anne, Duke of Joyeuse, on 24 September 1581. Entertainments were laid on almost every day for two weeks after the wedding, in what art historian Roy Strong has called [...] "the climax of Valois festival art". The chief artist employed to design the magnificences was Antoine Caron, who was aided by the sculptor Germain Pilon. Among the writers were Dorat, Ronsard, and Philippe Desportes; and the music was written by Claude Le Jeune and the Sieur de Beaulieu, among others. A programme for an entertainment with a sun–moon theme announced that [...] "twelve torch bearers will be men and women disguised as trees...the golden fruits of which will carry lamps and torches". The visual decorations included two arcades, one shining as a sun, to represent the king, the other as a moon, to represent the newlyweds. The arcades were linked to an amphitheatre <b>overhung</b> with artificial heavens of planets and constellations, and allusions to Catherine’s personal emblem, the rainbow. Into this amphitheatre, the king was to enter in a chariot, dressed as the sun.|$|E
500|$|It {{is unknown}} {{when the first}} bridge was {{constructed}} across the Avon in Bristol, but the first stone bridge, Bristol Bridge, {{was built in the}} 13th century. It had houses with shopfronts built on it to pay for its maintenance. A 17th-century illustration shows that these bridge houses were five stories high, including the attic rooms, and that they <b>overhung</b> the river much as Tudor houses would overhang the street. In the 1760s a bill to replace the bridge was carried through parliament by the Bristol MP Sir Jarrit Smyth. By the early 18th century, increase in traffic and the encroachment of shops on the roadway made the bridge fatally dangerous for many pedestrians. A new bridge, designed by James Bridges and finished by Thomas Paty was built in 1763 and 1768. Resentment at the tolls exacted to cross the new bridge occasioned the Bristol Bridge Riot of 1793. Other crossings were considered, but were restricted by Admiralty rules that stipulated that any bridge had to be at least [...] above the water to allow the passage of tall-masted warships, to Bristol Harbour. To achieve this, any bridge constructed between Bristol Bridge and Avon Gorge, from Hotwells to Ashton Gate, would require massive embankments and viaducts. The alternative was to build across the narrowest point of the Avon Gorge, well above the height required for shipping.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Williamson and Carr {{published}} a hypothetical growth series of S. validum, showing Ornatotholus as the juvenile stage. They suggested that juveniles {{were characterized by}} a flat, thickened frontoparietal roof, with larger supratemporal fenestrae, and studded with closely spaced tubercles and nodes. The parietosquamosal shelf was not reduced in size, and the frontoparietal suture was open. Sub-adults had mound-like domes, with the back part of the parietal and skull-roof being flat. The supratemporal fenestrae showed asymmetry in size, and {{the closure of the}} frontoparietal suture was variable. The nodes were stretched or almost obliterated as the dome expanded during growth, with a tesserated surface remaining. The pattern was often obliterated at the highest point (apex) of the dome, the area where maximum expansion occurred. The tubercles on the skull were stretched in different directions, and those at the margin of the parietosquamosal shelf may have been hypertrophied (enlarged) tubercles. The back and sides of sub-adult and adult skulls were ornamented by less modified tubercles. Before being incorporated into the enlarging dome, the skull bones expanded, resulting in junctions between these bones. The adult dome was broad and convex, and incorporated most of the shelf, which was reduced in size and <b>overhung</b> the occiput as a thick [...] "lip". The supratempooral fenestrae were closed, but the suture between the frontoparietal and connected skull bones was not always closed in adults and subadults.|$|E
500|$|A {{keep and}} a {{protective}} wall would usually {{be built on}} top of the motte. Some walls would be large enough to have a wall-walk around them, and the outer walls of the motte and the wall-walk could be strengthened by filling in the gap between the wooden walls with earth and stones, allowing it to carry more weight; this was called a garillum. Smaller mottes could only support simple towers with room for a few soldiers, whilst larger mottes could be equipped with a much grander building. Many wooden keeps were designed with a bretasche, a square building that <b>overhung</b> from the upper floors of the building, enabling better defences and a more sturdy structural design. The early 12th-century chronicler Lambert of Ardres described the wooden keep {{on top of the}} motte at the castle of Ardres, where the [...] "first storey was {{on the surface of the}} ground, where were cellars and granaries, and great boxes, tuns, casks, and other domestic utensils. In the storey above were the dwelling and common living-rooms of the residents in which were the larders, the rooms of the bakers and butlers, and the great chamber in which the lord and his wife slept...In the upper storey of the house were garret rooms...In this storey also the watchmen and the servants appointed to keep the house took their sleep". Wooden structures on mottes could be protected by skins and hides to prevent them being easily set alight during a siege.|$|E
2500|$|A typical Crampton feature, {{previously}} used on Liverpool, was {{the large}} {{diameter of the}} outside eccentrics used to drive the valve gear.

2500|$|Pilots {{agreed that}} the revised forward profile changed the view from poor on the D.VI to {{excellent}} on the D.VII. During development the D.VII acquired some {{of the features of}} the D.VIb, most noticeably <b>overhung,</b> balanced ailerons. [...] The empennage was also modified to a form close to that of the D.VIb, with a small, lower, and broader fin and broad chord balanced rudder. The tailplane was lowered {{from the top of the}} fuselage to its midpoint.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the common}} {{configuration}} {{the wings of}} the D.XVI and D.XVII were different. The D.XVIIs wings had constant chord and <b>overhung</b> ailerons. [...] It was mounted over the fuselage on each side with an inverted V-form strut pair from the leading edge to the lower fuselage longeron and a second strut from the rear wing spar to the same longeron further aft. [...] The structure was stabilized laterally with a further outward leaning strut between top of the forward V-strut and the upper fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The D.XV was {{developed}} over the summer of 1918 and versions with unbalanced ailerons (D.XVf) and <b>overhung,</b> balanced ailerons (D.XV (Spezial).

The horizontal tail was mounted at mid-fuselage, with a straight-edged, unswept tailplane bearing <b>overhung,</b> balanced elevators with outward increasing chord. Both prototypes had conventional undercarriages with a rigid axle mounted to the lower fuselage by V-form struts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{construction}} of many houses employed walls of sun dried clay bricks or wooden framework filled with fibrous material such as straw or seaweed covered with clay or plaster, on {{a base of}} stone which protected the more vulnerable elements from damp. The roofs were probably of thatch with eaves which <b>overhung</b> the permeable walls. [...] Many larger houses, such as those at Delos, [...] were built of stone and plastered.

2500|$|Images of {{the goddess}} show her enthroned, clad in chiton and mantle. On her left arm she holds a cornucopia, a sign of her {{abundant}} generosity and fruitfulness. In her right hand, she holds a bowl, which feeds a serpent coiled around her right arm: a sign of her healing and regenerative powers. This combination of snake and cornucopia are unique to Bona Dea. The literary record offers at least one variation on this type; Macrobius describes her cult statue as <b>overhung</b> by a [...] "spreading vine", and bearing a sceptre in her left hand.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{their working}} lives, the Z class {{locomotives}} remained in {{their role as}} heavy shunters in the larger marshalling yards at Hither Green, Norwood Junction, Exmouth Junction and Eastleigh, and proved to be very popular with the locomotive crews until they were replaced by diesel shunters of the D3/13 class (later Class 12) in the early 1950s.

At least one two-entranced, multi-seated public latrine <b>overhung</b> the bridge parapets and discharged into the river below; so did an unknown number of private latrines reserved for Bridge householders or shopkeepers and bridge officials. In 1382–83 a new latrine was made (or an old one replaced) at considerable cost, at the northern end of the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|The R.V {{was flying}} before mid-January 1924. There were plans to {{accommodate}} all three passengers in the cabin.

This advice was heeded {{and in the second}} aircraft the cockpit had been moved forward, the cut-out in the trailing edge removed and the cabin placed under the trailing edge. In addition, the ailerons were no longer <b>overhung</b> and the vertical tail was broader and less high. [...] This machine had a Daimler engine.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the tops}} of the outfield fences upwards, the {{baseball}} foul poles in the Metrodome were unique, in that they were not [...] "poles" [...] at all.

2500|$|By the Tudor era {{there were}} some 200 {{buildings}} on the bridge. Some stood up to seven storeys high, some <b>overhung</b> the river by seven feet, and some <b>overhung</b> the road, to form a dark tunnel through which all traffic had to pass, including (from 1577) the palatial Nonsuch House. The roadway was just [...] wide, divided into two lanes, so that in each direction, carts, wagons, coaches and pedestrians shared a single file lane six feet wide. When the bridge was congested, crossing it could take up to an hour. Those who could afford the fare might prefer to cross by ferry, but the bridge structure had several undesirable effects on river traffic. The narrow arches and wide pier bases restricted the river's tidal ebb and flow, so that in hard winters, the river upstream of the bridge became more susceptible to freezing and impassable by boat. [...] The flow was further obstructed in the 16th century by waterwheels (designed by Peter Morice) installed under the two north arches to drive water pumps, and under the two south arches to power grain mills; the difference in water levels on {{the two sides of}} the bridge could be as much as , producing ferocious rapids between the piers resembling a weir. Only the brave or foolhardy attempted to [...] "shoot the bridge"—steer a boat between the starlings when in flood—and some were drowned in the attempt.
