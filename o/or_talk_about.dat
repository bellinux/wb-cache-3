5|$|A senator {{could make}} a brief statement, discuss the matter in detail, <b>or</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if they could keep the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E

[...] " [...] one {{of those}} rare {{instances}} where none can review it, <b>or</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it, without mentioning the cameraman, art director, and score composer in the same breath as the actors and director." [...] Variety also praised the cast, writing that [...] "Karloff manages to invest the character with some subtleties of emotion that are surprisingly real and touching... Thesiger as Dr Pretorious [...] a diabolic characterization if ever there was one... Lanchester handles two assignments, being first in a preamble as author Mary Shelley and then the created woman. In latter assignment she impresses quite highly." ...|$|E

500|$|The idea to use Salon Kitty for espionage {{purposes}} {{came from}} Reinhard Heydrich, a leading SS general and police chief within Nazi Germany. Instead of infiltrating the brothel, Schellenberg {{decided to take}} it over altogether. The idea was to entertain prominent guests with wine and women, so they would disclose secrets <b>or</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> their real opinions to ensure their support could be relied upon. The nine rooms of the salon were lavishly expanded and renovated to the highest standards of the 1930s. Schellenberg installed covert listening devices in the rooms and converted the basement into a [...] "workshop" [...] where five operators could make transcriptions of conversations from the love-making rooms.|$|E

2500|$|During a Playboy {{interview}} in 1992, Williams {{was asked whether}} he ever feared losing his balance between his work and his life. He replied, [...] "There's that fear—if I felt like I was becoming not just dull but a rock, that I still couldn't speak, fire off <b>or</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> things, if I'd start to worry or got too afraid to say something ... If I stop trying, I get afraid." [...] While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist Jerzy Kosiński to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness, Williams felt he could overcome those risks. For that, he credited his father for strengthening his self-confidence, telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, Torre and {{his wife}} Ali {{established}} the Joe Torre Safe at Home Foundation. In October 2007 the Foundation partnered with the Union City, New Jersey Board of Education and the North Hudson Community Action Corporation (NHCAC) to establish the Foundation's Margaret Place initiative at Union City, New Jersey's José Martí Middle School, with a $325,000 donation from Verizon. It continues to receive yearly funding from that company of up to $65,000. The Foundation's mission is to educate and prevent domestic violence. Margaret's Place is named after Torre's mother, who {{was a victim of}} verbal and physical abuse at the hands of Torre's New York City Police officer father when Torre was a child. Torre describes his father as a [...] "bully", and while Torre himself was not a target of his father's violence, he has related that he never felt safe at home, and grew up in fear for his mother, saying, [...] "I always felt responsible for it. I never thought I belonged anywhere. I never felt safe except on the ball field." [...] Margaret's Place is a comprehensive program that provides students with a safe room in school where they can meet with a professional counselor trained in domestic violence intervention and prevention in order to address the student's home situation and educate them to understand domestic violence's impact on the community. The children are also given the opportunity to read, play games <b>or</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> their experience with others. The program, which is administered by health care professionals from North Hudson Community Action Corp, also includes an anti-violence campaign within the school, and training for teachers and counselors. It has grown to 11 sites in the region, though Union City's is the only such program in New Jersey.|$|E

6000|$|I must dwell {{a little}} on this point, for I wish you to leave this room with a very clear {{conviction}} that scientific investigation is not, as many people seem to suppose, some kind of modern black art. I say that you might easily gather this impression from {{the manner in which}} many persons speak of scientific inquiry, <b>or</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> inductive and deductive philosophy, or the principles of the [...] "Baconian philosophy."

6000|$|... in the 'Sonnet upon Sleep,' which Mrs. F. points out, {{had before}} been {{mentioned}} {{to me by}} Coleridge, and, indeed, by almost every body who had heard it, as eminently beautiful. My letter (as this second sheet, which I am obliged to take, admonishes me) is growing to an enormous length; and yet, saving that I have expressed my calm confidence that these poems will live, I have said nothing which has a particular application to the object of it, which was to remove all disquiet from your mind {{on account of the}} condemnation they may at present incur from that portion of my contemporaries who are called the public. I am sure, my dear Lady Beaumont, if you attach any importance to it, it can only be from an apprehension that it may affect me, upon which I have already set you at ease; or from a fear that this present blame is ominous of their future or final destiny. If this be the case, your tenderness for me betrays you. Be assured that the decision of these persons {{has nothing to do with}} the question; they are altogether incompetent judges. These people, in the senseless hurry of their idle lives, do not read books, they merely snatch a glance at them, that they may talk about them. And even if this were not so, never forget what, I believe, was observed to you by Coleridge, that every great and original writer, in proportion as he is great or original, must himself create the taste by which he is to be relished; he must teach the art by which he is to be seen; this, in a certain degree, even to all persons, however wise and pure may be their lives, and however unvitiated their taste. But for those who dip into books in order to give an opinion of them, <b>or</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> them to take up an opinion--for this multitude of unhappy, and misguided, and misguiding beings, an entire regeneration must be produced; and if this be possible, it must be a work of time. To conclude, my ears are stone-dead to this idle buzz, and my flesh as insensible as iron to these petty stings; and, after what I have said, I am sure yours will be the same. I doubt not that you will share with me an invincible confidence that my writings (and among them these little poems) will co-operate with the benign tendencies in human nature and society, wherever found; and that they will, in their degree, be efficacious in making men wiser, better, and happier. Farewell! I will not apologise for this letter, though its length demands an apology. Believe me, eagerly wishing for the happy day when I shall see you and Sir George here, ...|$|E
