25|$|A common {{distinction}} between dams and weirs is that water flows {{over the top}} (crest) of a weir or underneath it {{for at least some}} of its length. Accordingly, the crest of an <b>overflow</b> <b>spillway</b> on a large dam may therefore be referred to as a weir. Weirs can vary in size both horizontally and vertically, with the smallest being only a few inches in height whilst the largest may be hundreds of metres long and many metres tall.

40|$|Potentially {{high energy}} {{dissipation}} on stepped <b>overflow</b> <b>spillways</b> would imply {{a significant reduction}} {{of the size of}} downstream stilling basins. The amount of energy loss on such spillways under skimming-flow conditions is examined experimentally for structures with a moderate number of steps and a width-to-height ratio equal to 0. 7. The experimental results, supported by dimensional considerations, indicate that the most important parameters governing energy dissipation are the ratio of the critical depth of flow passing over the spillway to the step height y(c) /h, and the number of steps N. Dissipation is highest for the small values of y(c) /h tested, near unity, and decreases with increasing y(c) /h; for a certain y(c) /h the dissipation increases with N. The results are compared to those of earlier investigations referring to a large number of steps. For commonly used ranges of the step dimensions, a general relation is established between the energy loss and the parameter y(c) /h, which may be useful in practical applications...|$|R

The civil works of the intake facility will be comprised of a 133. 45 m wide diversion weir, with two <b>overflow</b> <b>spillways</b> and six gated sluice channels; a four bay intake structure with sediment excluder; and, a fish bypass facility. Northwest Hydraulic Consultants (NHC) evaluated the initial design of the Due intake and spillway facilities using a 1 : 35 Froude-scaled physical model for river discharges ranging from the intake design discharge of 57. 2 m 3 /s to the 1000 -year flood of 2, 339 m 3 /s. The testing in the physical model revealed some deficiencies {{in the performance of}} the initial design of the spillway stilling basins and some opportunities to reduce construction costs. Modifications to the initial design were proposed and evaluated in the model during the design optimization testing phase. The final recommended modifications included: adding a new stilling basin wall separating one of the <b>overflow</b> <b>spillways</b> from adjacent sluice channels; reducing the length of the stilling basin; decreasing the height and thickness of the stilling basin walls; and modifying pier noses to reduce flow disturbances. Furthermore, a sluice gate operation guideline was developed in order to maintain sufficient energy dissipation within the stilling basins for the range of river discharges covered in the study. The physical model was also utilized to evaluate the reservoir sediment flushing procedure and the performance of the intake sediment excluder. Fine sand was used in the model to simulate the reservoir deposits such that qualitative observations of the sediment flushing could be made. Accordingly, a sluice gate operating guideline was developed to maximize the sediment flushing from the reservoir. Finally, the physical model used light-weight sediments to evaluate the efficacy of the intake sediment excluder in trapping sediment to qualitatively observe the sediment load into the intake and the particle trapping process. Modifications to the intake sediment excluder were recommended to improve sediment trapping efficiency and reduce construction costs...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the measurement of self-aerated flow on the spillway of a large dam. The major part of the project involved the development of an air concentration probe and a velocity meter suitable for use under field conditions. The air concentration probe basically measures the electrical conductivity of a small filament of the flowing air-water mixture. The velocity meter measures the stagnation pressure at a point in the flow and relates this to the velocity and air concentration. Results subsequently obtained with the instruments on the spillway of the Aviemore Dam are presented. During testing, it was noted that the “critical point”, where aeration commenced, moved downstream with increasing flow discharge. Furthermore, it was found that its position could be predicted by means of a formula derived from a previous experimental study of model <b>overflow</b> <b>spillways.</b> An analysis of model data, obtained in a previous model study, was carried out and found to correlate well with the prototype data obtained on the Aviemore spillway. A design method for partially - aerated developing flows is presented. It was found that the governing criterion in spillway design is the extent of wall-induced aeration. Further development of the instruments to enable measurements to be made near the spillway side wall is discussed...|$|R
