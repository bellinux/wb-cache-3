5|$|The {{first case}} against Acton, before Mr. Baron Carter, {{was for the}} murder in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a {{carpenter}} and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left with so little to eat that {{he had tried to}} escape by throwing a rope over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, stamped <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach,</b> placed him in the hole (a damp space under the stairs), then in the strong room.|$|E
5|$|The next match {{featured}} Chris Benoit {{defending the}} United States Championship against Chavo Guerrero (accompanied by Vickie Guerrero). Before {{the bell rang}} to start the match, Chavo tried to attack Benoit, but as the match began, Benoit retaliated by delivering a clothesline. Benoit and Guerrero wrestled inconclusively until Benoit covered Chavo to try to pin him. Chavo managed to place his foot {{on top of the}} bottom rope, which forced Benoit to break the pin per official wrestling match rules. While Guerrero was lying <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach,</b> Benoit applied the Sharpshooter, and made Chavo submit to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a {{delivery}} van. He was first {{placed in the}} driver's cab, but complained the van's movement was causing him pain. He {{was placed in the}} back of the van, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach,</b> and taken to the emergency room at Bulovka Hospital. He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one of his lungs. He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A splenectomy was performed. The chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed.|$|E

5|$|At the office, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) announces to the {{employees}} that Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) {{will be his}} co-host at the Dundies. The Dundies are an annual award program created by Michael to motivate his employees. The idea of performance is worrisome to Deangelo, but Michael insists he take the job. Michael brings some of the staff together {{in the conference room}} to help Deangelo get prepared for the show, but he struggles to be humorous. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) tries to help him, saying he should just think of performing like conducting a meeting, but Michael objects, wanting Deangelo to mimic his style. Michael tries a number of different things to help Deangelo, such as sitting <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> and making him listen to a Walkman at full volume so he cannot hear himself think, but none are effective.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, Calaway {{started his}} own posse that {{consisted}} of fellow wrestlers Yokozuna, Savio Vega, Charles Wright, The Godwinns and Rikishi. The faction was called The Bone Street Krew and each member had the initials of the faction tattooed onto themselves, with Undertaker's being prominently shown <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach.</b>|$|E
25|$|De Villiers has a {{reputation}} as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of Simon Katich of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> facing away from the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes, who {{was also one of the}} finest fielders of his generation.|$|E

25|$|The {{author of}} The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album is Matt Groening, {{the creator of}} the {{animated}} series The Simpsons on which the book is based. It was released by Harper Paperbacks on November 20, 1991. The book's cover, which features the character Bart Simpson lying naked <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> on a bearskin rug, is a reference to a 1972 centerfold of Cosmopolitan in which American actor Burt Reynolds posed naked in a similar way. Newer printings feature Homer naked on the rug.|$|E
25|$|The game is {{also very}} common in the {{southwest}} counties of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset. In Dorset some games are played by bowling a technique known as the 'Dorset flop'. This is where the bowler crouches on the alley and throws himself and the ball forward landing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> and letting the ball go between two bowling lines. In some parts of Somerset the ball has to hit a pitch plate (a diamond painted on the alley) in order {{for it to be}} a legal ball. It is also popular in South Wales.|$|E
25|$|Around noon On 7 January 1888, Morcom was {{crossing}} Rundle Street in Adelaide {{when he became}} giddy and stumbled between the wheels of an oncoming trolley, landing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach.</b> The trolley driver, a James Rossiter, was unaware of Morcom's situation and drove the trolley, with its five tonne payload, over Morcom, fracturing his left thigh. Morcom was taken to Royal Adelaide Hospital, where surgeons thought it unnecessary to amputate his left leg. In hospital, Morcom progressed favourably until early {{on the morning of}} 15 January, when his condition deteriorated; he died at 3.00pm that afternoon.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ouch!" [...] yelled Woot, {{and kicked}} out his leg {{with so much}} energy that the frail bonds that tied him burst apart. His foot caught the Loon--who was leaning over him--full <b>on</b> <b>his</b> puffy <b>stomach,</b> and sent him {{shooting}} up into the air. When he was high over their heads he exploded with a loud [...] "pop" [...] and his skin fell to the ground.|$|R
25|$|In 1977, a giraffe called Victor tore {{a muscle}} in his leg, {{collapsed}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach,</b> and {{was unable to}} get up. The press suggested that he had slipped while trying to mate and compared his situation to the splits. All attempts to get him on his feet failed, and his plight became a major international news story. Portsmouth Dockyard made a hoist to attempt to raise him onto his feet. He {{died of a heart attack}} very shortly afterward in the arms of his keeper Ruth. The publicity turned Marwell into a major tourist attraction, and interest was revived the following summer, when Victor's mate, Dribbles, gave birth to a female calf named Victoria.|$|E
25|$|Herrera {{turned his}} prisoners over to men in his squad, then started {{crawling}} {{toward the other}} machine gun, firing as he went. (“My M-1 was talking, and the Germans understood what it was saying,” he commented later.) The position was protected by a minefield; GIs were throwing rocks into the area {{in an effort to}} explode the mines. Herrera got up and charged the Germans anyway, but as he neared the machine-gun nest, he stepped on a mine. He was thrown to the ground, both of his feet blown off at the ankle. Though bleeding heavily, he lay <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> and fired at the Germans, forcing them to stay down and thus enabling his squad to skirt the minefield, flank the enemy, and move in for the kill.|$|E
25|$|Bandai {{released}} {{a number of}} action figures related to the film; these toys including {{a number of different}} Baymax figures. One is a soft plastic 10-inch version that includes a series of projected stills from the film <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach,</b> which can be changed when the figure's arm is moved, and which emits accompanying sounds. Deluxe Flying Baymax, which retails for $39.99, depicts the armored version of the character and features lights and sounds that activate at the push of a button. Placing the Hiro figurine on his back changes the sounds into speech and when the figure is tilted, the sounds are those of flying. The Armor-Up Baymax (original retail cost $19.99) comes with 20 pieces of armor that can be assembled onto the robot by the owner. The other characters from the film, including the other members of team and Professor Callaghan (who is called Yokai) are issued in 4-inch action figures, each of which have eight points of articulation.|$|E
50|$|Szpilman {{could only}} hope that the flats {{on the first floor}} were the only ones burning, and that he would escape the flames by staying high. But within hours, his room filled with smoke, and he began to feel the effects of carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning. He was resigned to dying, and decided to commit suicide by swallowing sleeping pills followed by a bottle of opium. But as soon as he took the sleeping pills, which acted almost instantly <b>on</b> <b>his</b> empty <b>stomach,</b> he fell asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is wussing {{all your}} vera gude healths!"

50|$|During {{their first}} sexual encounter, Dulaney, {{overcome}} by lust, notices too late that Carlson is tying his arms {{behind his back}} using his own belt. Carlson pushes him onto the bed, removes his underwear, and while he is restrained, she humiliates him by pouring hot candle wax <b>on</b> <b>his</b> chest, <b>stomach,</b> and genitals, amused by the frustration and increasingly desperate reactions she is eliciting from Dulaney. The two then have sex with Carlson in complete control, an obvious counterpoint to their relationship in the courtoom, where Dulaney is the one in control.|$|R
500|$|Since Vishvavasu now did {{not have}} a head, but just two arms and a mouth <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach,</b> he {{came to be known as}} the Rakshasa (demon) Kabandha, the [...] "headless torso".

I turned the dead pilot over onto his back and opened the zipper of his flight jacket, saw the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (Marseille never {{actually}} received the Diamonds personally) and I knew immediately who this was. The paybook also told me." ...|$|E

The slice exhibited an eruption of plums and sweetmeats, overlaid by a perspiration of butter. It has been said that Sir Patrick had reached the age of seventy--it is, therefore, needless to add that he politely declined to commit an unprovoked outrage <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own <b>stomach.</b>|$|R
25|$|On August 30, 1840, Hanson {{was visiting}} friends in Thetford, Vermont {{when she was}} arrested {{for the murder of}} George Kinney and transported back to Boston. Hanson was held in prison for four months {{awaiting}} trial. According to Hanson's autobiography, she lived in cell number 5 in the common jail.

25|$|During World War II, both Japanese {{military}} personnel, {{especially the}} Kempeitai, {{and the officers}} of the Gestapo, the German secret police, used waterboarding {{as a method of}} torture. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the Double Tenth Incident occurred. This included waterboarding, by the method of binding or holding down the victim <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, placing a cloth over his mouth and nose, and pouring water onto the cloth. In this version, interrogation continued during the torture, with the interrogators beating the victim if he did not reply and the victim swallowing water if he opened his mouth to answer or breathe. When the victim could ingest no more water, the interrogators would beat or jump <b>on</b> <b>his</b> distended <b>stomach.</b>|$|R
500|$|The Mahabharata {{describes}} him thus: Kabandha was [...] "as {{big as a}} mountain, dark as a black cloud, with pointed hairs {{all over}} his body and looked fierce with a voice as loud as thunder. He had an eye <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach,</b> round and yellow, emitting a glare like a fire-name. Looking wicked he thrust his big tongue out of his huge mouth licking the sides." [...] The Ramayana presents a similar description of Kabandha. Kabandha had a broad chest and was without a head or neck. He had only one eye {{on his chest and}} a mouth on his belly. He used his long arms to draw his prey closer. Kabandha is often depicted as a tree.|$|E

On his back, Valo has the eyes of Edgar Allan Poe, which were done by Kat Von D and her then-husband Oliver Peck. On his lower back, Valo has the Estonian letter for [...] "night", which {{he shares with his}} brother.

On his left leg, Valo also has an Egyptian symbol for [...] "flame".|$|E
500|$|The {{next morning}} White went to City Hall armed with his police [...]38 Smith & Wesson {{revolver}} and 10 extra cartridges {{in his coat}} pocket. To avoid the metal detector he entered the building through a basement window, and proceeded {{to the office of}} Mayor George Moscone. [...] Following a brief argument, White shot the Mayor in the shoulder and chest, and then twice in the head. White then walked to his former office, reloading his gun, and asked Milk to join him. White then shot Milk in the wrist, shoulder and chest, and then twice in the head, execution style. Supervisor Dianne Feinstein heard the gunshots and called the police, who found Milk <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>stomach,</b> blood pouring out of his head wounds.|$|E

The heartagram around Valo's left nipple was done by Kat Von D to cover up the initial of a former girlfriend. Valo's left arm is covered with a full sleeve-tattoo, while his right arm has portraits of Timo K.

5000|$|After {{escaping}} church, the Simpsons {{look for}} a place to eat lunch. Upon seeing that all the restaurants have long lines, the family spots a catering van setting up food at a house. The family sneaks in and gorges themselves, only to find they have snuck into a wake. Homer is asked to be a pallbearer (to which he agrees thinking the woman who asked him meant a polar bear). At the cemetery, Homer struggles with the coffin and falls into an empty grave, hurting his back in the process. At the hospital Dr. Hibbert treats Homer and sets up to give him an X-ray to check out his vertebrae. While lying <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, Homer hears the cost of the X-ray, and lets out a [...] "D'oh!". To the surprise of everyone, Homer's “D’oh!” sounds beautiful and operatic. Dr. Hibbert concludes that when Homer lies <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> lodges underneath <b>his</b> diaphragm, which in turn helps propel his powerful singing voice.|$|R
