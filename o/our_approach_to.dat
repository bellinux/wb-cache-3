Tsipras became {{prime minister and}} formed his cabinet on 27 January, appointing Tsakalotos as Alternate Minister for International Economic Relations, subordinate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Nikos Kotzias. Tsakalotos described his role as follows: [...] " [...] means coordinating <b>our</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> promoting exports and attracting investment. It also means upgrading our economic diplomacy which needs to go beyond traditional sectors, for instance exporting olive oil and importing capital goods." ...|$|E

[...] Henry Clay said {{on the floor of}} the House of Representatives that it was from the Report of 1800, above other documents, that he had developed his own theories on constitutional interpretation. H. Jefferson Powell, a modern jurist, identifies three persistent themes of Democratic-Republican constitutionalism which emerged from the Resolutions and the Report: (1) a textual approach to the Constitution, (2) the compact theory, and (3) that caution, not trust, should characterize <b>our</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> those who hold political power.|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, ECB Chief Executive Tim Lamb stated [...] "David has done a magnificent job for England, including delivering our first five Test series victory for 12 years. For the moment nothing is more important than a successful World Cup campaign, and I know that David will give his all in achieving this." [...] Lloyd also commented that [...] "I've had a tremendous time with the England side and I'm looking forward to completing my tenure with a successful and enjoyable World Cup campaign. It was important for me to have a clear picture of what my future holds. Now that the matter is settled this means the team can focus exclusively on the World Cup." [...] Alec Stewart spoke for the team, stating [...] "It's disappointing news but it's been a real pleasure to work with [...] "Bumble", a coach who is thorough, loyal to his players and completely professional. He has brought a real sense of passion to the job of England coach and it would be great to reward him with the World Cup as a final vote of thanks from the players for all he has done for us." ...|$|E

One only object rears itself above the eddying waters; this is the mast of a vessel long since wrecked in attempting to cross the bar, and it still stands, a dismal witness of the destruction that has been, and a boding prophet of that which is to come.' ...|$|E
60|$|As, {{however, the}} day broke more {{distinctly}} in <b>our</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> {{the outskirts of}} the city, my tormentor, arising and adjusting his shirt-collar, thanked me in a very friendly manner for my civility. Seeing that I remained motionless (all my limbs were dislocated and my head twisted on one side), his apprehensions began to be excited; and arousing the rest of the passengers, he communicated, in a very decided manner, his opinion that a dead man had been palmed upon them during the night for a living and responsible fellow-traveller; here giving me a thump on the right eye, by way of demonstrating the truth of his suggestion.|$|E
60|$|To {{save the}} trouble of {{pitching}} our tent, when we had secured our stores from wandering dogs, we camped in the solitary half-open barn near the bank, {{with the permission of}} the owner, lying on new-mown hay four feet deep. The fragrance of the hay, in which many ferns, etc., were mingled, was agreeable, though it was quite alive with grasshoppers which you could hear crawling through it.

Sinking on his knee, he waved me off with one hand, while with the other he held aside some intervening leaves, and gazed intently at some object.|$|E
60|$|The train {{stopped a}} minute or two, to allow the tickets to be taken, just before {{entering}} the Sheffield station, and thence I had {{a glimpse of the}} famous town of razors and penknives, enveloped in a cloud of its own diffusing. My impressions of it are extremely vague and misty,--or, rather, smoky: for Sheffield seems to me smokier than Manchester. Liverpool, or Birmingham,--smokier than all England besides, unless Newcastle be the exception. It might have been Pluto's own metropolis, shrouded in sulphurous vapor; and, indeed, <b>our</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> it had been by the Valley of the Shadow of Death, through a tunnel three miles in length, quite traversing the breadth and depth of a mountainous hill.|$|E
60|$|I {{spent the}} greater part of the next day in walking about the town and visiting {{different}} people. The town is of considerable size, and is said to contain 20,000 inhabitants; the streets are very clean and regular. Although the island has been so many years under the English government, the general character of the place is quite French: Englishmen speak to their servants in French, and the shops are all French; indeed I should think that Calais or Boulogne was much more Anglified. There is a very pretty little theatre in which operas are excellently performed. We were also surprised at seeing large booksellers' shops, with well-stored shelves;--music and reading bespeak <b>our</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the old world of civilisation; for in truth both Australia and America are new worlds.|$|E

60|$|I {{have been}} led into these remarks by observing the {{vineyards}} here. The qualities of wines, of course, {{are affected by}} the positions of the vineyards, for all who can make wine do not make good wine, but the vines of Vévey, owing most probably to their exposure, are said to be the best of Switzerland. The best liquor comes from St. Saphorin, a hamlet that is quite near the town, which lies {{at the foot of the}} acclivity, described to you in <b>our</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> this place. The little chateau-looking house that so much struck our fancies, on that occasion, is, in fact, in the immediate neighbourhood of the spot.

60|$|The {{ascent to}} the village from the river is by steps cut in a narrow cleft of the schist rocks, to a flat, {{elevated}} 4,178 feet above the sea: we here procured a cottage, and found the people remarkably civil.

Except pines, there are few large trees; but the quantity of species of perennial woody plants contributing to form the jungles is quite extraordinary: I enumerated 140, of which 60 were trees or large shrubs above twenty feet high. One of these was the Hamamelis chinensis, a plant hitherto only known as a native of China.
