Deficiency in receptors for leptin (LepRdb-db and Leprdb-lb) in mice likewise result in obesity, diabetes, pre-diabetes, and MetS[67, 105]. Thus, it has been postulated that while leptin and leptin receptor signaling act to suppress food intake and maintain long-term energy balance, the excess serum leptin found in obesity may reflect a state of leptin resistance[104].|$|R

40|$|Abstract Pig breeds have {{significant}} differences in fat deposition and muscle development ability. However, the molecular mechanism behind these differences is still unknown. In this study, the expression patterns of three candidate genes, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS- 3), obesity (ob) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), which are involved in adipose metabolism or muscle development, were analyzed. Total RNA was extracted from dorsal subcutaneous adipose tissue and longissimus of 8 -month-old Bamei and Largewhite pigs. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to deter-mine the expression levels of the SOCS- 3 and <b>ob</b> <b>genes</b> in adipose tissue, and SOCS- 3 and IGF-I genes in muscle tissue. The results showed that in adipose tissue the expression level of SOCS- 3 was significantly higher in Bamei (obese) pigs than that in Largewhite (lean) pigs (P< 0. 01). However, in muscle tissue it was significantly lower in Bamei than that in Largewhite pigs (P< 0. 01).

40|$|The ARF tumor {{suppressor}} regulates p 53 as well {{as basic}} developmental processes independent of p 53, including osteoclast activation, by controlling ribosomal biogenesis. Here we provide evidence that ARF is a master regulator of bone remodeling and osteosarcoma (OS) development in mice. Arf(-/-) mice displayed increased osteoblast (OB) and osteoclast (OC) activity with a significant net increase in trabecular bone volume. The long bones of Arf(-/-) mice had increased expression of <b>OB</b> <b>genes</b> while Arf(-/-) <b>OB</b> showed enhanced differentiation in vitro. Mice transgenic for the Tax oncogene develop lymphocytic tumors with associated osteolytic lesions, while Tax+Arf(-/-) mice uniformly developed spontaneous OS by 7 months of age. Tax+Arf(-/-) tumors were well differentiated OS characterized by an abundance of new bone with OC recruitment, expressed OB markers and displayed intact levels of p 53 mRNA and reduced Rb transcript levels. Cell lines established from OS recapitulated characteristics of the primary tumor, including the expression of mature OB markers and ability to form mineralized tumors when transplanted. Loss of heterozygosity in OS tumors arising in Tax+Arf(+/-) mice emphasized the necessity of ARF-loss in OS development. Hypothesizing that inhibition of ARF-regulated bone remodeling would repress development of OS, we demonstrated that treatment of Tax+Arf(-/-) mice with zoledronic acid, a bisphosphonate inhibitor of OC activity and repressor of bone turnover, prevented or delayed the onset of OS. These data describe a novel role for ARF as a regulator of bone remodeling through effects on both OB and OC. Finally, these data underscore the potential of targeting bone remodeling as adjuvant therapy or in patients with genetic predispositions to prevent the development of OS...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} was leptin and the leptin receptor, {{and the role of}} these <b>genes</b> (<b>OB</b> and OB-R) in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans and Psammomys obesus, a polygenic rodent model of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Studies in humans showed that circulating leptin concentrations were positively associated with adiposity, and independently associated with circulating insulin and triglyceride concentrations. Analysis of two leptin receptor sequence polymorphisms in a Caucasian Australian population and a population of Nauruan males, with very high prevalence rates of obesity, showed no associations between sequence variation within the OB-R gene and obesity- or diabetes-related phenotypic measures. In addition, these two OB-R polymorphisms were not associated with longitudinal changes in body mass or composition in either of the populations examined. A unique analysis of the effects of multiple gene defects in the Nauruan population, demonstrated that the presence of sequence alterations in both the <b>OB</b> and OB-R <b>genes</b> were associated with insulin resistance. Psammomys obesus is regarded as an excellent rodent model in which to study the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans. Examination of circulating leptin concentrations in Psammomys revealed that, as in humans, leptin concentrations were associated with adiposity, and independently associated with circulating insulin concentrations. This animal model was utilised to examine expression of OB-R, and the regulation of expression of this gene after dietary manipulation. OB-R is known to have several isoforms, and in particular, OB-RA and OB-RB gene expression were examined. OB-RB is the main signalling isoform of the leptin receptors. It has a long intracellular domain and has previously been shown {{to play an important role}} in energy balance and body weight regulation in rodents and humans. OB-RA is a much shorter isoform of OB-R, and although it lacks the long intracellular domain necessary to activate the JAK/STAT pathway, OB-RA is also capable of signalling, although to a lesser degree than OB-RB. OB-RA is found to be expressed almost ubiquitously throughout the body, and this isoform may be involved in transport of leptin into the cell, although its role remains unclear. OB-RA and OB-RB were both found to be expressed in a large number of tissues in Psammomys obesus. Interestingly, obese Psammomys were found to have lower levels of expression of OB-RA and OB-RB in the hypothalamus, compared to lean animals. This finding raises the possibility that decreased leptin signalling in the brain of obese, hyperleptinemic Psammomys obesus may contribute to the leptin resistance previously described in this animal model. However, the primary defect is unclear, as alternatively, increased circulating leptin concentrations may lead to down-regulation of leptin receptors. The effect of fasting on leptin concentrations and gene expression of OB-RA and OB-RB was also examined. A 24 -hour fast resulted in no change in body weight, but a reduction in circulating leptin concentrations, and an increase in hypothalamic OB-RB gene expression in lean Psammomys. In obese animals, fasting again did not alter body weight, but resulted in an increase in both circulating leptin concentrations and hypothalamic OB-RB gene expression. In the liver, fasting resulted in a large increase in OB-RA gene expression in both lean and obese animals. These results highlighted the fact that regulation of leptin receptor gene expression in polygenic models of obesity and type 2 diabetes is complex, and not solely under the control of circulating leptin concentrations. Sucrose-feeding is an established method of inducing obesity and type 2 diabetes in rodents, and this experimental paradigm was utilised to examine the effects of longer term perturbations of energy balance on the leptin signalling pathway in Psammomys obesus. Addition of a 5 % sucrose solution to the diet of lean and obese Psammomys resulted in increased body weight in both groups of animals, however only obese Psammomys showed increased fat mass and the development of type 2 diabetes. The changes in body mass and composition with sucrose-feeding were accompanied by decreased circulating leptin concentrations in both groups of animals, as well as a range of changes in leptin receptor gene expression. Sucrose-feeding increased hypothalamic OB-RB gene expression in obese Psammomys only, while in the liver there was evidence of a reduction in OB-RA and OB-RB gene expression in both lean and obese animals. The direct effects of sucrose on the leptin signalling pathway are unclear, however it is possible to speculate that the effect of sucrose to decrease leptin concentrations may have been involved in the exacerbation of obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes in obese Psammomys, From these studies, it appears that sequence variation in the <b>OB</b> and OB-R <b>genes</b> is unlikely to be a major factor in the etiology of obesity in human populations. The ability to examine regulation of expression of these genes in Psammomys obesus, however, has demonstrated that the effects of nutritional modifications on leptin receptor gene expression need closer attention. The role of the <b>OB</b> and OB-R <b>genes</b> in metabolism and the development of type 2 diabetes also warrants further examination, with particular attention on the differential effects of dietary modifications on leptin receptor gene expression across a range of tissues...|$|R
40|$|Obesity is {{a complex}} disease, and {{multiple}} genes contribute to the trait. The description of five <b>genes</b> (<b>ob,</b> db, tub, Ay, and fat) responsible for distinct syndromes of spontaneous monogenic obesity in mice has advanced {{our knowledge of the}} genetics of obesity. However, many other genes involved in the expression of this disease remain to be determined. We report here the identification of an additional class of genes involved in the regulation of adipose tissue mass. These genes encode receptors mediating leukocyte adhesion. Mice deficient in intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 became spontaneously obese in old age on normal mouse chow or at a young age when provided with a diet rich in fat. Mice deficient in the counterreceptor for intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, the leukocyte integrin αMβ 2 (Mac- 1), showed a similar obesity phenotype. Since all mice consumed approximately the same amount of food as controls, the leukocyte function appears to be in regulating lipid metabolism and/or energy expenditure.

The Sf 29 gene is a viral factor that determines the number of virions in occlusion bodies (OBs). The Sf 29 null bacmid virus was able to recover the Sf 29 gene during passage. After the third passage (P 3) of Sf 29 null bacmid OBs, the population was observed to reach an equilibrium involving a mixture of those with a kanamycin resistance cassette and those with the Sf 29 gene.

40|$|Leptin {{is a small}} {{polypeptide}} codified by the Obese <b>Gene</b> (<b>OB),</b> deeply {{related with}} the body fat mass and energetic balance.

The concentration of leptin in the body is determined by the amount of adipose tissue; therefore, hyperleptinemia is a common finding in obese individuals. In addition, high levels of circulating leptin may confer a poor prognosis for any pathological condition. Although leptin history has been reported for more than 20 years, its relationship with cancer has gained notoriety in the past ten years, where studies focused on discussing the issue of obesity as a strong risk factor for cancer developing. Further, growing evidences have pointed leptin as a pivotal mediator of immune response, which aggravates the scenario of cancer occurrence in the presence of obesity. Therefore, leptin can present at least two faces in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, acting by immune and non-immune mechanisms.

40|$|Leptin, {{the product}} of the obesity <b>gene</b> (<b>ob)</b> {{predominantly}} secreted from adipocytes, {{plays a major role in}} the negative control of feeding and acts via a specific receptor (Ob-R), six isoforms of which are known at present. Evidence has been accumulated that leptin, like other peptides involved in the central regulation of food intake, controls the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, acting on both its central and peripheral branches. Leptin, along with Ob-R, is expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, where it modulates corticotropin-releasing hormone and ACTH secretion, probably acting in an autocrine-paracrine manner. Only Ob-R is expressed in the adrenal gland, thereby making it likely that leptin affects it by acting as a circulating hormone. Although in vitro and in vivo findings could suggest a glucocorticoid secretagogue action in the rat, the bulk of evidence indicates that leptin inhibits steroid-hormone secretion from the adrenal cortex. In keeping with this, leptin was found to dampen the HPA axis response to many kinds of stress. In contrast, leptin enhances catecolamine release from the adrenal medulla. This observation suggests that leptin activates the sympathoadrenal axis and does not appear to agree with its above-mentioned antistress action. Leptin and/or Ob-R are also expressed in pituitary and adrenal tumors, but little is known about the role of this cytokine in the pathophysiolog...|$|R

However, the functional interplay between both factors in this process has not been explored so far. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} present study was to analyze the impact of the absence of the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) gene in the regulation of energy balance in ob/ob mice. Methods and Findings: Double knockout (DBKO) mice simultaneously lacking the <b>ob</b> and iNOS <b>genes</b> were generated, and the expression of molecules involved in the control of brown fat cell function was analyzed by real-time PCR, western-blot and immunohistochemistry. Twelve week-old DBKO mice exhibited reduced body weight (p, 0. 05), decreased amounts of total fat pads (p, 0. 05), lower food efficiency rates (p, 0. 05) and higher rectal temperature (p, 0. 05) than ob/ob mice. Ablation of iNOS also improved the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism of ob/ob mice. DBKO showed a marked reduction in the size of brown adipocytes compared to ob/ob mutants. In this sense, in comparison to ob/ob mice, DBKO rodents showed an increase in the expression of PR domain containing 16 (Prdm 16), a transcriptional regulator of brown adipogenesis.

50|$|Having {{encountered}} {{obesity in}} {{children as a}} medical doctor in the 1970s, Leibel believed that biology played a stronger role than “will power” in human obesity and joined Jules Hirsch in theorizing about the psychobiology of obesity - a belief that body weight {{was the result of}} complex interactions between genes and the environment rather than a simple matter of free will. In 1978, based on his theory that genetics {{played a major role in}} determining body weight regulation in humans, Leibel left Harvard University to join Jules Hirsch at Rockefeller University with the goal of finding the factor that drove eating. In collaboration with Douglas Coleman, Leibel determined that a mutation of the <b>ob</b> <b>gene</b> resulted in mice that were unable to manufacture a working satiety-signaling protein and that a db mutation resulted in mice that had the protein, but lacked the ability to detect the signal. Leibel and Hirsch began a series of scientific investigations aimed at laying the groundwork for determining the connection between genetics and obesity. Over the course of eight years, Leibel's work ranged from studies of glycerol to the development of a radioisotpic technique for analysis of free fatty acid re-esterification in human adipose tissue to the metabolic characterization of obesity. After concluding that the tools of molecular genetics were key to moving his research forward and finding the obesity gene, Leibel initiated a collaboration with then-junior Rockefeller University faculty member and molecular biologist Jeffrey Friedman in 1986, and began to assemble a team of researchers including Streamson C. Chua, Nathan Bahary, Don Siegel, Yiying Zhang, Ricardo Proenca and others. Leveraging his respected and senior status within the scientific community, Leibel obtained ongoing funding from the National Institutes of Health and other sources, allowing the team to develop and utilize new techniques in their research such as chromosome microdissection.|$|E
50|$|The {{observations}} that long-term feed restriction does not significantly affect lep expression in Atlantic salmon {{has also been}} noted in other teleosts. However {{it is likely that}} prolonged feed restriction can influence several endocrine parameters to adapt to the nutritional condition. For example, in common carp, a rapid response in <b>ob</b> <b>gene</b> expression in hepatic tissue of common carp shortly after feeding, but no changes in expression in response to different long-term feeding regime was observed. These authors suggested that this effect could be {{explained by the fact that}} starved fish do not lose weight as rapidly as mammals, a consequence of being ectothermic and possessing a much lower standard metabolic rate, and therefore can withstand longer periods of starvation. A similar study on grass carp showed that chronic injection of species-specific Lep did not affect long-term food intake and body weight, while acute injection decreased food intake. Conversely, Murashita et al., (unpublished results) observed increased proopiomelanocortin a1(pomca1) levels following chronic injection of Lep in Atlantic salmon, which suggests that chronic exposure to elevated Lep levels can decrease food intake through the Pomc pathway in this species. Recent studies in Atlantic salmon did not observe any difference of feed restriction in circulating plasma levels, which contrasts recent results in rainbow trout and suggest that the relation between circulating lep levels and energy status differs from that in mammals. However, salmon RIA appears to allow interspecies assessment of plasma lep levels. This only confirms that more comprehensive studies are needed for conclusive data interpretation. Studies on rainbow trout also implicated Lep as an anorectic hormone as in mammals. Injection of rainbow trout with recombinant trout leptin (rt-leptin) resulted in a significantly reduced appetite over two days that coincided with a decrease in hypothalamic mRNA expression of neuropeptide Y (npy) and increase of pomc mRNAs, respectively. Whether these observations are due to species-specific differences in long-term leptin regulation of appetite or growth is not known, however, consensus data indicate that the effects of Lep on appetite regulation may be short-term in teleosts.|$|E

40|$|Concurrent to the {{impressive}} improvement achieved {{over the last}} few decades for the trait of milk production in dairy cows was a steady decline in several fertility traits including oestrous behaviour (OB). An understanding of the genomic regulation of OB, which is currently lacking in dairy cows, will present new opportunities for managing this trait to help improve fertility. The research described in this thesis therefore aimed to achieve this understanding by studying gene expression in the bovine anterior pituitary (AP) and four brain areas (amygdala, hippocampus, dorsal hypothalamus and ventral hypothalamus) that are involved in regulating OB. A series of different analyses were performed that included model based association of <b>gene</b> expression with <b>OB</b> scores, <b>gene</b> co-expression and differential expression. In the association analyses, the identified genes included those previously not known to be related to OB associated processes as well as several genes expressed in mid-cycle that may have a function in the proper expression of OB at the next oestrus. Expected genesknown to be involved in OB associated processes like socio-sexual behaviour (e. g. OXT, AVP, GABRA 6, HTR 2 A, DRD 2), anxiety, stress and feeding motivation (e. g. POMC, MCHR 1, TTR) were found along with genes associated with nervous system related processes (e. g. CHRM 1, CHRM 3, CHRNA 5, CTLA 4, IL 1 RL 1, MARCO), suggesting a link between neuronal plasticity and OB. In the co-expression analyses, biological terms found common to several OB correlated consensus modules included general cellular processes like oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome and biosynthetic processes, indicating increased transcription and protein synthesis. These processes are primary events in the activation of neuronal cells and pathways involved in female reproductive behaviour and they precede the oestrogen driven expansion of dendrites and synapses. Hub <b>genes</b> within the <b>OB</b> correlated modules (e. g. NEFL, NDRG 2, GAP 43, THY 1, TCF 7 L 2 etc.) are strong candidates among <b>genes</b> regulating <b>OB</b> expression.

To conclude, this study has revealed important new aspects of the genomic regulation of OB in dairy cows with the key findings presented {{within the framework of the}} GAPPS modules.

40|$|Obesity is {{a chronic}} {{pathology}} with multi-factorial aetiology, characterized by extreme body weight due to storing {{of fat in}} the adipose tissue, caused by an increase of caloric income, decrease of energetic intake, or both. The body weight control is a mechanism finely regulated by several hormonal, metabolic, and nervous pathways. Recessive homozygous mutations in the ob/ob and db/db mouse strain cause extreme obesity. The products of the <b>ob</b> and db <b>genes</b> are leptin and its receptor, respectively (1, 2). The leptin receptor is critical for energy homeostasis and regulation of food uptake. Leptin is a 16 kDa hormone that is mainly secreted by fat cells into the bloodstream. Under normal circumstances, circulating leptin levels are proportionate to the fat body mass. Sensing of elevated leptin levels by the hypothalamic neurocircutry activates a negative feedback loop resulting in reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure. Decreased leptin concentrations lead to opposite effects. Therefore rational design of leptin agonists could be an interesting challenge {{in the fight against}} obesity. Unfortunately only the crystal structure of leptin is available, but not that of the leptin receptor. In this work, first, we build by homology modelling the leptin receptor starting from FASTA sequence and the similarity search of templates. The obtained model was used to perform a protein-protein docking with the crystal structure of leptine by means Gramm-X server, with the aim to define the complementary surfaces of the two proteins. The complex of leptin/leptin receptor was then used as starting point to carry out molecular dynamics simulations in water solvent to characterize the key residues involved into the protein-protein interaction and to identify the guidelines for rational drug design of new agonists of leptin, which could be used in the therapy of obesity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>ob</b> <b>gene</b> mRNA {{expression}} in rat brown adipose tissue (BAT) and epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) was measured on Northern blots hybridized with a rat <b>ob</b> <b>gene</b> probe. The level of <b>ob</b> <b>gene</b> mRNA in BAT was about 40 % {{of that in}} WAT. Fasting (36 h) or semi-starvation (10 days) decreased the <b>ob</b> <b>gene</b> mRNA level in both tissues by 62 – 68 %, and cold exposure at 6 °C (24 h) decreased it in BAT (− 84 %) _but not in WAT. Acute administration of the β 3 -adrenergic agonist Ro 16 - 8714 decreased the <b>ob</b> <b>gene</b> mRNA level in BAT (− 51 %) and WAT (− 28 %) of lean Zucker rats and only in BAT (− 74 %) of obese falfa rats. This study demonstrates that, in the rat, the <b>ob</b> <b>gene</b> is not only expressed in WAT but also in BAT, and suggests that in these two tissues, the modulation of the <b>ob</b> <b>gene</b> expression might be more closely associated with known alterations in cell lipid content than with changes in sympathetic activity...|$|E
40|$|Non-insulin-dependent {{diabetes}} mellitus (NIDDM) {{is a complex}} metabolic disorder with a significant genetic component. Obesity is a frequent complicating factor for NIDDM. In the mouse, a number of single gene defects that result in obesity have been described. Mutations {{in one of these}} genes, the <b>ob</b> <b>gene,</b> results in both obesity and NIDDM. Recently, the cloning of the murine <b>ob</b> <b>gene</b> and its human homologue has been reported {Nature 372 : 425 - 432, 1994).

40|$|The obese (<b>ob)</b> <b>gene</b> has {{recently}} been isolated through a positional cloning approach, the mutation of which causes a marked hereditary obesity and diabetes mellitus in mice. In the present study, we isolated rat ob cDNA and examined the tissue distribution of the <b>ob</b> <b>gene</b> expression in rats. We also studied the gene expression in genetically obese Zucker fatty (fa/fa) rats. The rat <b>ob</b> <b>gene</b> product, a 167 amino acid protein with a putative signal sequence, was 96 and 83 % homologous to the mouse and human ob proteins, respectively. Northern blot analysis using the rat ob cDNA probe identified a single mRNA species of 4. 5 kb in size in the adipose tissue, while no significant amount of ob mRNA was present in other tissues in rats. The <b>ob</b> <b>gene</b> was expressed in the adipose tissue with region specificities. The rank order of the ob mRNA level in the adipose tissue was epididymal, retroperitoneal, and pericardial white adipose tissue > mesenteric and subcutaneous white adipose tissue > or = interscapular brown adipose tissue. The <b>ob</b> <b>gene</b> expression occurred in mature adipocytes rather than in stromalvascular cells isolated from the rat adipose tissue. Expression of the <b>ob</b> <b>gene</b> was markedly augmented in all the adipose tissue examined in Zucker fatty (fa/fa) rats at the stage of established obesity.

In diesem Zusammenhang wurden anfänglich mehrere Reportergene in Streptomyces exprimiert und verschiedene Methoden zur Transformation von Streptomyces im Hinblick auf ihre Anwendbarkeit und Effizienz getestet und optimiert. Als geeignetste Transformationsmethode erwies sich die Protoplastentransformation. Mit dieser Methode konnten Transformationseffizienzen von 10 exp 6 cfu/ µg DNA in Streptomyces lividans erzielt werden und damit ausreichende Werte für die Herstellung von Genbanken erhalten werden. Nach Aufreinigung genomischer DNA aus Böden wurde eine mehr als 18500 Klone umfassende Genbank in Streptomyces lividans erstellt und auf Lipase- bzw. Esteraseaktivität getestet. Darüber hinaus wurde untersucht, <b>ob</b> die <b>Gene</b> für die Catechol- 2, 3 -dioxygenase und die BTL 2 - Lipase, die in verschiedenen Schritten der Aufreinigungsprodzedur von Boden-DNA eingebracht wurden, in einem anschließenden Screening aufgefunden werden können. Durch das Wiederfinden dieser Gene wurde die Durchführbarkeit dieser Methoden demonstriert. So konnte die Catechol- 2, 3 -dioxygenase in einem von 2200 gescreenten Kolonien und die BTL 2 - Lipase in zwei von 3000 gescreenten Kolonien nachgewiesen werden. Weiterhin wurde auf den Einsatz von Streptomyceten in verschiedenen Assaysystemen hingearbeitet, die eine Verwendung von Mikrotiterplatten zum Hochdurchsatz Screening erfordern. Es konnte gezeigt werden, daß Mikrotiterplatten im 96 er und 384 er Format, sowohl bei Verwendung des halbsynthetischen R 5 Mediums für die Kultivierung von Streptomyces, als auch für die {{qualitative}} und quantitative Durchführung von Farbassays im Kulturüberstand geeignet sind. It {{exists a}} {{great interest in}} industrial applicable enzymes, deriving from new sources. Out of this reason within the last years every effort was made to get access to new enzymes out of environmental samples. In this context mainly bacteria are of interest due to their high natural diversity. Since there are only 4000 bacteria characterized, it is assumed that more than 99. 5 % are not cultivable and out of this not accessible to the classic methods for gaining new enzymes. The application of suitable methods for extraction and purification is in common considered as the best solution to tap the resources of microbial diversity. These methods should be able to extract the genomic DNA of all microorganisms within the soil sample. A further condition is that it should also remove traces of humic acids and heavy metals, in order to achieve good results in restriction, ligation and transformation of this DNA in suitable vectors and host organisms. E. coli as the most common bacterial host has proven difficulties in the functional expression of DNA from common soil bacteria like actionmycetes. Out of this reason as a further host organism beneath E. coli for the heterologous expression of genomic DNA from soil samples Streptomyces was chosen. The aim of this work was the production of gene libraries for the expression of soil DNA in Streptomyces and screening these libraries for enzyme activity. For the usage of Streptomyces as host organism for the expression of genomic DNA from soil several steps were performed. After suitable strains for transformation were selected, different transformation systems for Streptomyces were optimised due to an application for the transformation with soil DNA. For this purpose also several reporter genes were tested. With these optimised expression systems an agar plate screening for lipase and esterase activity was performed. In case for the test of other enzyme activities, e. g. epoxide hydrolyses, in which no suitable agar plate assays are available, alternative methods for the high throughput screening with Streptomyces should be developed. As a possible solution for this problem the cultivation of Streptomycetes in microtiter plates was examined...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{product of}} the obesity <b>gene</b> (<b>ob),</b> leptin, has a well-recognized role in {{regulating}} energy homeostasis. During the period of weight maintenance, circulating leptin concentration reflects total body fat mass. On the other hand, overnutrition is accompanied by progressive hyperleptinemia. In overnourished animals, the elevation in circulating fatty acids results in increased uptake and excessive deposition of lipids within muscle cells. Consequently, triglicerydes overload seems to strongly correlate to the impairment of insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, the primary target for insulin stimulated glucose disposal. High levels of leptin {{in the course of}} fat storage may protect non-adipose tissues from lipid accumulation. Aim of the study Here, we aim to evaluate in vitro the relationship between leptin treatment and expression of acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), a peroxisomal key enzyme involved in fatty acid catabolism. We also evaluate the adaptive response of cells to a putative oxidative insult, resulting from H 2 O 2 production. Methods The effects of increasing levels of leptin, at different times, were assessed on mouse C 2 C 12 myotubes by semiquantitative PCR. Activation pathway was investigated by using extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) inhibitors. Cellular adaptive response to oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring glutathione concentration, oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio and the main antioxidant enzymatic activities. Results A 1. 8 -fold increase in ACOX mRNA expression was evident at 20 ng/ml leptin, a dose comparable to that found in hyperleptinemic subjects. The induction was dose-dependent, with an increase of 3 -fold at 100 ng/ml; the ability of leptin to stimulate ACOX mRNA reached a maximum at 20 min and was lost in myotubes continuously exposed for more than 1 h. ACOX enzymatic activity followed mRNA changes: it was doubled after 1 h treatment and remained elevated for 24 h. ERK and cPLA(2) pathway is involved, since their inhibitors abrogated the ACOX mRNA induction. Myotubes counteract the resulting oxidative insult by catalase and glutathione peroxidase activation, thus removing H 2 O 2 at the expenses of the reduced glutahione pool. Conclusions The present study shows that acute, but not chronic, leptin treatment of C 2 C 12 myotubes induces ACOX expression. Peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation may work together with mitochondrial beta-oxidation to remove excessive lipids from non-adipose tissues, during early stages of overnutrition and before development of leptin resistance...|$|R
