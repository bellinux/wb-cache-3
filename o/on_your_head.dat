5|$|Radau summarises one {{passage from}} the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese walking up tall trees, leaning back on ropes as they pull {{themselves}} upwards; the indescribable taste of a durian fruit, at once recalling custard, almond paste, roasted onions, sherry {{and a host of}} other things, that melts on the tongue, that one does not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, and the tree is dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men run amok, generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death.|$|E

500|$|Admitting {{she is not}} perfect, Beyoncé {{sings the}} lines [...] "Would you rather I be a machine who doesn't notice when you late or when you lyin'?" [...] and [...] "No I'm not an angel, but at least I'm trying". In [...] "No Angel", Beyoncé {{declares}} that her partner is [...] "no angel either", remarking {{that he is not}} perfect. However, despite his imperfections, the protagonist admits she still loves him. Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "nderneath the pretty face is something complicated / I come with a side of trouble / But I know that's why you're staying" [...] in the song aimed to inform her [...] "roguish" [...] male lover. The lines of the chorus are sung by Beyoncé with pronouncing one word at a time in longer intervals. A short interlude about [...] "mov things to the bedroom" [...] is interpolated in the song. Beyoncé forgoes lyrical subtlety during that part, singing explicit lines such as [...] "Tell me do you wanna ride?" [...] and [...] "First both of my legs go back <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> and whatever you want, yeah baby, I'm bad". Fuse's Mark Sundstrom interpreted the song's message as talking about the singer's husband Jay-Z and added [...] "She loves him more because she knows him entirely, accepting he's not perfect or without a past". Complex editor Claire Lobenfeld considered its lyrical content to be about how a [...] "couple's respective internal messiness can bring them closer together".|$|E
500|$|There was a Ceklin zduhać {{who was so}} {{beaten by}} other zduhaći {{that he had to}} die, and there he was, dying. Various {{remedies}} were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You will have to go tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath." [...] "I will also take a musket," [...] added the brother, and the sick man said, [...] "You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but you must have the knife." [...] "I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred," [...] interrupted the brother again. [...] "Take it easy with your boldness," [...] resumed the sick man, [...] "and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, {{and there will be a}} silence in the air; then you will notice a wisp of cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Judaism, shaving {{with a razor}} is a {{prohibition}} {{that is based on}} rabbinic interpretation of Leviticus 19:27, which states, [...] "You shall not round off the side-growth <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> or destroy the side-growth of your beard." [...] The Mishnah interprets this as {{a prohibition}} on using a razor on the beard. This prohibition is further expanded upon in kabbalistic literature. The halakhic prohibition applies to shaving off the pe'ot (sidelocks) and corners of the beard by means of a razor.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 April 2008 the Daily Mail {{reported}} that Harman {{had decided to}} wear a kevlar-reinforced stab vest while touring her Peckham constituency under police guard. On 2 April The Guardian relayed information from the Metropolitan Police that [...] "the type of Met Vest she wore over her jacket protected her from knife attacks and bullets, and, for her at least, was optional". Harman compared the decision to wearing a hard hat while touring a building site, which led the BBC's John Humphrys to respond, during an interview for BBC Radio 4, [...] "You wear a hard hat on a building site because... there is the danger that something might drop <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> You don't need to wear a bullet-proof vest {{on the streets of}} London, do you!" [...] Harman told the BBC that the neighbourhood police team she was with put on their stab vests and gave her one to wear as well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{narrative}} in 2 Samuel 1 {{also contains a}} narrative which is often interpreted as false testimony. The 1 Samuel narrative had described Saul as killing himself by falling on his own sword after having been wounded by the Philistines on Mount Gilboa and being in a situation with no hope of victory or escape. However, 2 Samuel tells of an Amalekite, who was probably on Mount Gilboa to strip the dead of their possessions, appearing to David with Saul’s crown and royal arm band and giving testimony that he had himself killed king Saul. [...] David immediately ordered that the Amalekite be put to death, saying, [...] "Your blood be <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have killed the ’s anointed.'" [...] The truth of the Amalekite’s testimony {{did not need to}} be determined for the sentence to be carried out: either the Amalekite had killed King Saul, or he had given false testimony to David regarding Saul’s death. [...] Both crimes were seen as [...] equally deserving of the death penalty.|$|E

2500|$|The ships {{bringing}} John and {{his court}} arrived in Lisbon on [...] His return was orchestrated {{in such a}} manner as not to imply that the king had been coerced, but in fact a new political environment had already been established. A constitution had been drafted, and the king was required to swear loyalty to it on [...] It called for him to surrender various prerogatives. Dona Carlota refused to follow her husband in agreeing to this, and thus was dispossessed of her political rights and deposed of her title as queen. Meanwhile, the king lost out in Brazil as well. His son Pedro, opting to stay in that country, led a revolt that proclaimed Brazilian independence on as part of this action, he assumed the title of emperor of Brazil. Tradition says that before journeying to Portugal, John had anticipated future events and had said to his son: [...] "Pedro, Brazil will soon be separated from Portugal: if so, put the crown <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> before some adventurer grabs it." [...] According to the memoirs of the Count of Palmela, Brazilian independence had come about through common accord between the king and the prince. In any event, later correspondence between the two shows the prince's concern not to disturb his father. However, Portugal did not officially recognize Brazilian independence at this time.|$|E
2500|$|Obviously, such a {{character}} discrepancy {{can create a}} problem for productions of the play. As {{an example of one}} way in which productions can resolve the problem, in Act 1, Scene 1 of the 1981 BBC Shakespeare adaptation, Montague is not present in either the persona of Salisbury or that of John Neville. As such, his first two lines, [...] "Good brother, as thou lov'st and honour'st arms,/Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus" [...] (ll.117–118), are reassigned to Clarence and altered to [...] "Set it <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> good father/If thou lov'st and honour'st arms,/Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus." [...] Montague's second line, [...] "And I unto the sea from when I came" [...] (l.210), is entirely absent. As {{a character}}, Montague is then introduced in Act 1, Scene 2, played by Michael Byrne (as he is {{for the rest of the}} production). His first line in this scene however, [...] "But I have reasons strong and forcible" [...] (l.3) is reassigned to Clarence. Later, when York is giving his men instructions, his order to Montague, [...] "Brother, thou shalt to London presently" [...] (l.36) is changed to [...] "Cousin, thou shalt to London presently", and York's reiteration of the order [...] "My brother Montague shall post to London" [...] (l.54) is changed to [...] "Hast you to London my cousin Montague." [...] Additionally, Montague's [...] "Brother, I go, I'll win them, fear it not" [...] (l.60) is changed to [...] "Cousin, I go, I'll win them, fear it not." [...] This all serves to establish a single figure who is York's cousin and Warwick's brother (i.e. John Neville).|$|E
