The Luftwaffe bombed the airfield in August 1940 as well as <b>other</b> <b>sector</b> airfields in the area, including Biggin Hill, Hornchurch and North Weald, as part of a concentrated effort against the airfields and sector stations of No.11 Group RAF. A total of 4,000 bombs were recorded as falling within two miles (3km) of the airfield over a fifteen-month period, although only two were recorded as hitting the airfield itself. Under the leadership of the station commander, Group Captain Stanley Vincent, the airfield was camouflaged to resemble civil housing. Vincent had been concerned that camouflaging the airfield as open land would look too suspicious from the air; Northolt was surrounded by housing and so a large open area would draw attention. A fake stream was painted across the main runway while the hangars were decorated to look like houses and gardens. The result was so effective that pilots flying to Northolt from other airfields often struggled to find it.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the first results of original empirical research on differences between public projects and projects in <b>other</b> <b>sectors.</b> First we will define {{the very concept}} of a public project, before presenting the results of research performed in over 60 countries. The research shows a greater complexity of managing public projects than of managing projects in <b>other</b> <b>sectors.</b> Relatively, in comparison to projects of <b>other</b> <b>sectors,</b> the most complicated public projects management areas are stakeholder management, procurement management, and communications management. These management areas therefore require that special training programs be developed in public institutions.

2500|$|Construction {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{dangerous}} occupations in the world, incurring more occupational fatalities than any <b>other</b> <b>sector</b> in both the United States and in the European Union. In 2009, the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers in the United States was nearly three times that for all workers. Falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers. Proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry. Due to the fact that accidents may have disastrous consequences for employees as well as organizations, it is of utmost importance to ensure health and safety of workers and compliance with HSE construction requirements. Health and safety legislation in the construction industry involves many rules and regulations. [...] For example, the role of the Construction Design Management (CDM) Coordinator as a requirement has been aimed at improving health and safety on-site.|$|E

2500|$|Mixtures of decimal prefixes and binary sector sizes require care to {{properly}} calculate total capacity. Whereas semiconductor memory naturally favors powers of two (size doubles each time an address pin {{is added to}} the integrated circuit), the capacity of a disk drive is the product of sector size, sectors per track, tracks per side and sides (which in hard disk drives with multiple platters can be greater than 2). Although <b>other</b> <b>sector</b> sizes have been known in the past, formatted sector sizes are now almost always set to powers of two (256 bytes, 512 bytes, etc.), and, in some cases, disk capacity is calculated as multiples of the sector size rather than only in bytes, leading to a combination of decimal multiples of sectors and binary sector sizes. For example, 1.44MB 3½-inch HD disks have the [...] "M" [...] prefix peculiar to their context, coming from their capacity of 2,880 512-byte sectors (1,440 KiB), consistent with neither a decimal megabyte nor a binary mebibyte (MiB). Hence, these disks hold 1.47MB or 1.41MiB. Usable data capacity {{is a function of the}} disk format used, which in turn is determined by the FDD controller and its settings. Differences between such formats can result in capacities ranging from approximately 1300 to 1760 KiB (1.80 MB) on a standard 3½-inch high-density floppy (and up to nearly 2 MB with utilities such as 2M/2MGUI). The highest capacity techniques require much tighter matching of drive head geometry between drives, something not always possible and unreliable. For example, the LS-240 drive supports a 32MB capacity on standard 3½-inch HD disks, but it is, however, a write-once technique, and requires its own drive.|$|E
