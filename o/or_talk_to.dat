5|$|Hepburn {{was known}} for being {{fiercely}} private, and would not give interviews <b>or</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> fans for much of her career. She distanced herself from the celebrity lifestyle, uninterested in a social scene she saw as tedious and superficial, and she wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention {{in an era of}} glamour. She rarely appeared in public, even avoiding restaurants, and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer's hand when he took a picture without asking. Despite her zeal for privacy, she enjoyed her fame, and later confessed that she would not have liked the press to ignore her completely. The protective attitude thawed as she aged; beginning with a two-hour-long interview on The Dick Cavett Show in 1973, Hepburn became increasingly open with the public.|$|E

Performed [...] "as a prayer for deliverance from [...] pain and suffering," [...] lyrically, [...] "God Help the Outcasts," [...] a song about faith, explores themes such as discrimination. Additionally, “God Help the Outcasts” [...] "touches on a basic idea behind most faiths." [...] Asking [...] "was Jesus [...] not an outcast, too, as [...] sees firsthand how her people, are persecuted for their differences," [...] the first verse of the song reads, [...] "I don't know if You can hear me/Or if You're even there/I don't know if You would listen/To a gypsy's prayer." [...] Teen Ink observed, [...] "This part is about how it seems like God doesn't listen to you or help you, {{no matter how much}} you pray <b>or</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him." [...] Finally, asking people to be kind and unselfish, Esmeralda sings, [...] "Please help my people, the poor and downtrodden/I thought we all were the children of God.” In The Gospel According to Disney, author Mark I. Pinsky drew similarities between [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] and the Christian hymn [...] "His Eye Is on the Sparrow," [...] as both songs explore [...] "the love of God that knows no bounds." [...] Midler's shorter rendition, considered a reprise of Mollenhauer's original, features modified lyrics, replacing [...] "to a gypsy's prayer" [...] with [...] "to a humble prayer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Clarke and Linzey {{argue that}} for the {{ordinary}} membership of TM their lives and daily concerns are little— if at all— affected by its cult nature. Instead, {{as is the case}} for Scientology, it is only the core membership who must give total dedication to the movement. A former TM teacher, who operates an online site critical of TM, says that 90 percent of participants take an introductory course and [...] "leave with only a nice memory of incense, flowers, and smiling gurus" [...] while [...] "the 10 percent who become more involved". He says those participants encounter [...] "environments where adherents often weren't allowed to read the news <b>or</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> family members".

2500|$|When the 4e DCr {{attacked}} from [...] the German [...] anti-tank guns shot away tank aerials and pennants but {{bounced off}} the armour. Some German troops panicked and ran away, [...] captured and the French retook {{about half of the}} Abbeville bridgehead. Again, the Allies had too few infantry to hold the captured ground and ended back on their start lines, minus [...] the 4e DCr tanks. Allied attacks were reduced in effect by a chronic lack of tactical communication, caused by an inadequate number of radios. Tanks, infantry and artillery could not stay in contact <b>or</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> their divisional headquarters and inter-army tactical liaison was only possible at the lowest level. On 4 June, French tanks drove onto a minefield in an area thought to be held by the 51st Highland Division. The highlanders had been moved back during the evening of 3 June and had failed to notify the French troops on the flanks; German troops followed up and planted the mines in an obvious tank avenue between woods.|$|E

2500|$|During early production, Age of Empires Online was {{originally}} called Age of Empires IV. The development team {{had noticed that}} many other RTS game developers had {{moved away from the}} [...] "economic game". The team felt that [...] had blended the economic and military aspects of the game perfectly, so they decided to play test it with hindsight. They noticed that many features had been lost or changed over time. It was during this time the team decided to do an [...] "Age of Kings style gameplay in an Age of Empires setting". The designers were surprised that fans of the series were most fond of the simpler aspects of the previous titles. Former Age of Empires II lead designer Ian M. Fischer stated, [...] "When we started floating some of the early [...] out to people other pieces fell into place – I cannot tell you how many times I have had someone email me <b>or</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me at a show and mention how much they loved the villagers carrying big hunks of meat in the original Age or the priest [...] "wololo"". From that point on, one of the goals was to invoke nostalgia from fans of the series when playing the game, despite the newer and updated features.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{journalists and}} writers {{have written about}} Kishore Kumar's {{seemingly}} eccentric behavior. He placed {{a sign that said}} [...] "Beware of Kishore" [...] at the door of his Warden Road flat. Once, producer-director H. S. Rawail, who owed him some money, visited his flat to pay the dues. Kumar took the money and when Rawail offered to shake hands with him, reportedly Kishore put Rawail's hand in his mouth, bit it and asked [...] "Didn’t you see the sign?". Rawail laughed off the incident and left quickly. According to another reported incident, once Kumar was due to record a song for producer-director G. P. Sippy. As Sippy approached his bungalow, he saw Kumar going out in his car. Sippy asked Kumar to stop his car but Kumar increased his speed. Sippy chased him to Madh Island where Kumar finally stopped his car near the ruined Madh Fort. When Sippy questioned his strange behavior, Kumar refused to recognize <b>or</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him and threatened to call the police. The next morning, Kumar reported for the recording session. An angry Sippy questioned him about his behaviour the previous day but Kumar said that Sippy must have dreamt the incident and said that he was in Khandwa on the previous day.|$|E

I've {{never had a chance to}} correct my early impression of him, and he still remains an almost dreadful memory, a sort of caricature of incompetent simplicity. As I remember him, indeed, he presented the servile tradition perfected.
