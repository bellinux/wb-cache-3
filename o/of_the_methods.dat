5|$|In {{addition}} to the conceptual framework several additional factors enabled the GWA studies. One was the advent of biobanks, which are repositories of human genetic material that greatly reduced the cost and difficulty of collecting sufficient numbers of biological specimens for study. Another was the International HapMap Project, which, from 2003 identified {{a majority of the}} common SNPs interrogated in a GWA study. The haploblock structure identified by HapMap project also allowed the focus on the subset of SNPs that would describe most of the variation. Also the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> to genotype all these SNPs using genotyping arrays was an important prerequisite.|$|E

One was an extremely free translation (or rather a paraphrase) of The Protreptic of Galen (Paraphrase de C. GALIEN, sus l'Exhortation de Menodote aux estudes des bonnes Artz, mesmement Medicine), and in his so-called Traité des fardemens (basically a medical cookbook containing, once again, materials borrowed mainly from others), he included a description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> he used to treat the plague, including bloodletting, none of which apparently worked. The same book also describes the preparation of cosmetics.|$|E

5|$|By the 5thcentury, the Romans had {{withdrawn}} from Britain, and the Angles and the Saxons settled. A heptarchy of new kingdoms began to emerge. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> used by regional kings to solidify their authority over their territories {{was the use}} of ceremony and insignia. The tomb of an unknown king– evidence suggests it may be Rædwald of East Anglia– at Sutton Hoo provides insight into the regalia of a pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon king. Inside the early 7th-century tomb discovered in 1939 was found the ornate Sutton Hoo helmet, comprising an iron cap, a neck guard, and a face mask, decorated with images of animals and warriors in copper-alloy and set with garnets. He was also buried with a heavy whetstone sceptre, on top of which is an iron ring surmounted by the figure of a stag; a decorated sword; and a ceremonial shield.|$|E
5|$|Handled {{the ball}} was {{formerly}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket, but was integrated into the Law on obstructing the field when the Laws of Cricket were rewritten in 2017. It dictated that either batsman can be given out if they intentionally touch the ball with a hand that is not holding their bat. An exception was given if the batsman handled the ball to avoid injury. It was governed by Law 33 of the 2000 Edition of the Laws, and was a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed: {{in the history of}} cricket, there have been 61 instances in first-class matches and 5 occasions in List A games. In most cases this occurred when a batsman thought that {{the ball was}} going to hit their wicket, and knocked it away from the stumps with their hand.|$|E
