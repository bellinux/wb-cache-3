5|$|After {{playing in}} the first four matches of the 2004–05 WNCL season, Poulton missed three matches in a row before playing her final match of the season against Queensland and being dropped for the three finals matches against Victoria. New South Wales lost the finals 2–1 after {{finishing}} the regular season first and earning the right to host the series. Poulton batted <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> and accumulated eight runs at 4.00 but New South Wales nevertheless won all of these five matches.|$|E
5|$|Chappuis {{played in}} nine games for Michigan {{as a sophomore}} in 1942, {{contributing}} 220yards rushing, 358yards passing, and 30yards receiving. In his first game as a college halfback, Chappuis completed seven of eighteen passes for a gain of 80yards, and also rushed for 49yards in a 9–0 win over the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. Chappuis' predecessor as Michigan's halfback, Heisman Trophy winner Tom Harmon, completed seven passes in a single game <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> in three years, a feat accomplished by Chappuis in his first game.|$|E

5|$|Australia then {{defeated}} South Africa {{in their}} first Test of the tournament. Macartney made 21 in an innings victory and did not bowl. Macartney's batting waned in the next seven tour matches, passing 50 <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> in ten innings. However, he did take 13 wickets, including 6/54 against Yorkshire. Macartney then scored 99 in a drawn Test against England at Lord's that did not reach the second innings. Wisden regarded the innings as his best for the season. Macartney added half-centuries in consecutive county matches and after three further matches without passing 21, the Tests resumed.|$|E
5|$|Bonass {{came into}} the team at outside-right for the fifth game of the new season, before {{reverting}} to outside-left against Sheffield Wednesday on 17 September, which coincided with Chesterfield's first win. Two weeks later, he scored the only goal of the game at home to West Ham United direct from a corner kick. He kept his place {{to the end of}} the year, but then played <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> before the end of February when he submitted a transfer request. The Derbyshire Times reported no disharmony between club and player, who just felt that different surroundings might help a return to form. He moved on to London club Queens Park Rangers (QPR) in June, and played in all three of their matches before the 1939–40 Football League season was abandoned when war broke out.|$|E
5|$|Sangay (also {{known as}} Macas, Sanagay, or Sangai) {{is an active}} {{stratovolcano}} in central Ecuador. It is the most active volcano in Ecuador, despite erupting <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> in recorded history, because the eruption that started in 1934 is still ongoing. It exhibits mostly strombolian activity. Geologically, Sangay marks the southern boundary of the Northern Volcanic Zone, and its position straddling two major pieces of crust accounts for its high level of activity. Sangay's approximately 500,000-year-old history is one of instability; two previous versions of the mountain were destroyed in massive flank collapses, evidence of which still litters its surroundings today.|$|E

5|$|The 2001–02 {{season was}} the 104th season of {{competitive}} football played by Arsenal. Having ended the previous season as FA Cup finalists and league runners-up to Manchester United, the club went one better in this campaign, by completing the domestic double – their second {{in four years}} and third overall. Arsenal won the Premier League by a seven-point margin, were unbeaten {{away from home and}} managed the unique feat of scoring in every league game. They lost <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> in the division, all of which at home. At the Millennium Stadium, Arsenal beat Chelsea 2–0 to win the 2002 FA Cup Final. In Europe however, they fared poorly as they were eliminated in the second group stage of the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{dissolved}} in December 1991. Nine former soviet states {{became part of}} the IIHF and began competing in international competitions, including Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia and Ukraine. Russia was named the successor to the Soviet Union. With this flood of new teams, the IIHF expanded the number of spots from eight to twelve. From 1963 to 1991, only four teams won a World Championship medal: the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia (failing to win a medal <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>times),</b> Sweden and Canada. The Soviets won a medal in every tournament they participated in (1954 to 1991). At the 1992 World Championships, Sweden won their second consecutive gold. Finland won the silver medal, the nation's first ever World Championship medal (the Finnish team had previously won a silver at the 1988 Winter Olympics).|$|E
5|$|Carlsen won the London Chess Classic on 8–15 December {{in a field}} {{comprising}} World Champion Anand, Vladimir Kramnik, Nakamura, and British players Adams, Nigel Short, David Howell, and Luke McShane. Carlsen had a rocky start, {{losing his}} games to McShane and Anand in rounds 1 and 3, but winning with white against Adams and Nakamura in rounds 2 and 4. He joined the lead with a win over Howell in round 5, and managed {{to stay in the}} lead following a harrowing draw against Kramnik in round 6, before defeating Short in the last round. Since the tournament was played with three points for a win, Carlsen's +4−2=1 score put him ahead of Anand and McShane who scored +2=5 (a more traditional two-points-for-a-win system would have yielded a three-way tie, with Carlsen still on top, having the better tiebreaker due to four games with black—Anand and McShane played <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> with black).|$|E

5|$|In the 1938–39 season, O’Reilly removed Hassett {{twice in}} three innings in matches {{between the two}} states. Their rivalry culminated in two {{encounters}} on the SCG {{at the conclusion of}} the 1939–40 season. The first, between Victoria and NSW, effectively decided the winner of the Sheffield Shield; Victoria had won the first match between the two teams for the season. By scoring 122 in both innings, Hassett became the only player to score two centuries in a match against a team containing O'Reilly. Nevertheless, NSW won the game and the shield, before playing against a Rest of Australia combination. Batting for the Rest of Australia, Hassett almost repeated his feat by making 136 and 75, but this was not enough to stop NSW, who demonstrated their strength with another victory. Hassett had scored five half-centuries in the five preceding matches of the season, including three in four innings against Grimmett’s South Australia, and ended the Australian summer with 897 runs at 74.75. He lost his wicket to O'Reilly in a first-class match <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>times.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} combat for 3rd Battalion in 1968 came on 7 February, {{about a week}} after the Tet Offensive began, when Kilo Company engaged a PAVN {{battalion}} near Gio Linh. 29 Kilo Marines were killed, including PFC Robert Quick who was awarded a posthumous Navy Cross for deflecting a PAVN hand grenade. Another 31 were wounded, including PFC Craig Swartz who was wounded three times and received three purple hearts for his service. PAVN losses numbered at least 139, with another 60 graves discovered by 3rd Battalion Marines three days later. That same month a platoon from Mike Company observed and damaged two PAVN PT-76 tanks near Alpha 3, one of <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> they were encountered during the Vietnam War before 1972. On 6 March, Mike Company blundered into the 27th Regiment of the PAVN 325th Division and had one-third of the company put out of action in an all-night engagement, including 14 Marines killed.|$|E
