40|$|Abstract: The {{most common}} types of weirs are the broad-crested weir, the sharp-crested weir, the circular-crested weir and {{nowadays}} the <b>ogee</b> crest <b>weir.</b> Advantages of the cylindrical weir shape include the stable overflow pattern, the ease to pass floating debris, {{the simplicity of}} design compared to ogee crest design and the associated lower costs. In this study, the authors describe new experiments of circular weir overflows, with eight cylinder sizes, for several weir heights and for five types of inflow conditions: partially-developed inflow, fully-developed inflow, upstream ramp, upstream undular hydraulic jump and upstream (breaking) hydraulic jump. Within {{the range of the}} experiments, the cylinder size, the weir height D/R and the presence of an upstream ramp had no effect on the discharge coefficient, flow depth at crest and energy dissipation. But the inflow conditions had substantial effects on the discharge characteristics and flow properties at the crest. Practically the results indicate that discharge measurements with circular weirs are significantly affected by the upstream flow conditions...|$|R

In present study, it was investigated the overflow characteristics of circular weirs in laboratory for various cylinder radii of three sizes (11. 4, 9. 0, 6. 3 cm), and the models fixed on the channel bed vertically to the direction of flow. The result shows {{that the increase in}} the ratio of head to weir radius ratio (H w /R) value causes an increase in discharge coefficient (C d) value for the same height of weir. It was observed that the cylinder size (i. e. radius of cylindrical weir (R)) has an effect on the (C d). The flow magnification factor (q w /q s) increases with an increase in (H w /R) value and values of (q w /q s) were always higher than one for all values of (H w /R), this means that weirs of cylindrical shape performed better than those of sharp crest for any value of weir radius tested in this study. </p...|$|R
40|$|Of {{the many}} {{hydraulic}} structures developed by man, the weir {{is perhaps the}} oldest. Weirs are used for the measurement of discharge and regulation of water flow. The most common types of weirs are broad-crested, sharp-crested, circular-crested and cylindrical, and <b>ogee</b> crest <b>weirs.</b> Advantage of the circular-crested and cylindrical weir {{compared to the other}} weirs include simplicity of design, stable overflow pattern, larger coefficient of discharge and the associated lower costs. In the present study, potential flow around a circular cylinder are adapted to determine the velocity distribution at the crest section and to develop a model for coefficient of discharge (Cd) for circular-crested weirs. These results were evaluated using present test data for three types of weir models, namely, cylindrical, semicylindrical and semicylindrical with different heights and also Dressler theory. The results of the study showed that the experimental velocity profile agree very well with the theoretical profiles for the range of the study. Also, the prediction of the velocity distribution over the weir crest using Dressler theory is always less than the proposed model and measured data. The predicted values of coefficient of discharge (Cd) based on the proposed model agree well with Cd determined from direct discharge measurements. For the cylindrical model, the coefficient of discharge can be predicted from the proposed model within an error of – 7 % and for the semicylindrical and semicylindrical with different heights within ± 5 %...|$|R
40|$|After heavy rainfall, sewer {{overflow}} spills {{to receiving}} water bodies cause serious {{concern for the}} environment, aesthetics and public health. To overcome these problems this study investigated a new self-cleansing sewer overflow screening device. The device has a sewer overflow chamber, a rectangular tank and a slotted <b>ogee</b> <b>weir</b> to capture the gross pollutants. To design an efficient screening device a numerical computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model was used. A plausibility check of the CFD model was done using a one-dimensional analytical model. Results showed that an inlet parallel to the weir ensured better self-cleansing than an inlet perpendicular to the weir. Perforations {{should be at the}} bottom of the weir to get increased velocity and shear stress to create a favourable self-cleaning effect of the screening device. Increasing inlet length from 0. 3 to 1. 5 m reduced wave reflection up to 10 %, which increased flow uniformity downstream and improved self-cleansing effect. The orientation of the <b>ogee</b> <b>weir</b> with the rectangular tank was found most uniform with a 1 : 3 (horizontal:vertical) slope. These results will help to maximise functional efficiency of the new sewer overflow screening device.

Due to increasing public complains engineers are focusing on retention of the entrained sewer solids within the sewer overflow device. Present study investigates the hydrodynamic characteristics of a self cleansing sewer overflow device with no mechanical or electrical components. The device has a rectangular tank and a slotted <b>ogee</b> <b>weir</b> to capture the gross pollutants. The proposed device is deviated from traditional weir as in a traditional weir flow along a creek; the incoming flow is stable without any significant reflection. Whereas, significant reflections of inflow will occur due to smaller dimension of the device, which needs to be accommodated within existing urban sewerage system. State of art Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique was used to simulate the flow phenomena and compared with analytical results. In both cases atmospheric pressure was consider as a boundary condition over the <b>ogee</b> <b>weir,</b> therefore good agreement between analytical and numerical results were found.

Near {{the right side of the}} device, where inflow is reflected by the side wall, velocity and water level were found almost twice compared to normal flowing water on the sloping plane.

40|$|The City of Rochester {{plans to}} {{excavate}} the Culver-Goodman tunnel and connect {{it to the}} existing Cross-Irondequoit tunnel through a control structure which will limit the flow diverted for treatment to about 1050 cfs. A 16 ft diameter entrance tunnel with a round to square transition at the downstream end conveys the incoming flow to a distribution chamber. The original design, Type A, distribution chamber is 100 ft long by 76 ft wide, contains 1 : 1 side slopes, blocks at the upstream end to dissipate some of {{the energy of the}} incoming flow, and an <b>ogee</b> crested <b>weir</b> at the downstream end. The floor of the distribution chamber is at elevation 285 ft and the weir crest at elevation 315 ft. Six sluices each 5 ft x 2. 5 ft direct the diverted flow downward into the drop chamber. To enter the sluices the incoming flow has to make a 90 degree turn. The 100 ft long by 20 ft wide drop chamber also turns the flow 90 degrees towards the 12 ft diameter exit tunnel. The drop chamber is required to be of sufficient size to dissipate the energy of the falling water and to reduce the flow velocity so that the entrained air in the water-air mixture can rise to the surface and escape. Blocks at the downstream end assist in this process. The floor of the drop chamber is at elevation 216 ft and the top is open to the ground surface.

Residents {{did not support the}} project and application of the design criteria resulted in massive and costly spillway improvements to bring the structure into compliance with the high hazard design criteria. In mid 2004 Golder Associates Inc. was contracted by Gwinnett County for the design of the conceptual solution proposed by previous consultants. Golder’s evaluation of the conceptual design identified several modifications could be made to the preliminary design parameters. During preliminary design, the proposed spillway was significantly modified such that the size of the chute was reduced by 30 % (over 200 linear feet) and the proposed <b>ogee</b> <b>weir</b> was replaced by a broad-crested weir. These changes were possible by modifying the spillway crest to permit additional flow during more frequent storm events, but the existing mapped 100 year floodplain remains unchanged.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} of urban drainage {{are more concerned}} with water quality issues and aesthetic concern in receiving water bodies as sewer overflow can cause detrimental effects on the environment. The impacts of such uncontrolled sewer overflow include environmental, aesthetic, ecological and public health concerns. To overcome these problems different types of screening devices are used. Due to increasing public complaints, scientists and engineers are focusing on retention of the entrained sewer solids within the sewer overflow device. There are a number of different screening systems used in sewer overflow locations. Some of the common drawbacks in the available commercial devices include inadequate screening capacity, external power needs and high cost. Research has been undertaken to develop a new sewer overflow screening device to overcome these existing limitations. Design criteria for the conceptual device needs to have a self-cleansing capacity to work efficiency in unstaffed remote locations, robust start-stop operations, device fail outlet for extreme events, no moving parts, no sophisticated electrical-mechanical signal, low maintenance and establishment cost etc. Establishing an experimental setup involves significant cost and time; moreover it is important to maximize functional efficiency of the device as alteration of the device would be an expensive, troublesome and at times difficult to customize accordingly to existing urban drainage systems. State of art CFD modelling techniques can provide detail on the impacts of velocity, water level, shear stress, wave reflection etc. A self-cleansing sewer overflow screening device with a sewer overflow chamber, a rectangular tank and a slotted <b>ogee</b> <b>weir</b> to capture the gross pollutants was investigated. To design an efficient sewer overflow screening device a 3 D fluid dynamics model (CFD) was used. To understand dynamic flow properties such as velocity, water levels, wave refection and shear stress, two different inlet orientations; parallel and perpendicular to the weir direction were tested. The results are compared using simplified analytical model based on well-established physical laws. Numerical results show that the flow is not uniform (across the width of the inclined surface) {{at the top of the}} inclined surface; however flow becomes uniform near the bottom. Uniform flow at the bottom of the inclined surface will help to remove pollutants adhered to the perforations. Due to varying water levels (high water level near the right side and low water near the left side), near the top of the weir surface, the self-cleansing property will not be as effective near the top region. The CFD simulated shear stress is less than the analytical model as it is unable to consider flow undulations. Analysis of the shear stress along the flow path was performed to identify efficient self-cleansing screeners. CFD simulation showed that the shear stress increases significantly at the bottom of the inclined surface of the sewer screener device, which suggests that, the location of screen should be towards the bottom. Discussion of the comparison of CFD and analytical results will help to design an effective and efficient sewer overflow screening device. 7 page(s...|$|E
