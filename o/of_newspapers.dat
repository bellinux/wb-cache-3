He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in July 1912, and despite the fact that the legitimacy of the trial was seriously questioned when the main witness for the prosecution retracted, he was only released in 1934 after having served 27 years.|$|E

40|$|Orientation : The {{outsourcing}} <b>of</b> <b>newspaper</b> distribution {{seems to}} be one of the sources of precarious employment for newspaper distribution contractors and their employees. Research Purpose : In an attempt to contribute to the debate on outsourcing, this paper explored the effects <b>of</b> outsourcing <b>newspaper</b> distribution on the labour market experiences <b>of</b> <b>newspaper</b> distribution contractors and their employees in Durban. Motivation for the study : The labour market experiences of workers in precarious employment, especially those in the lower echelon <b>of</b> <b>newspaper</b> distribution, are rarely known. Research Design, approach and method : The study is a qualitative research which sought to explore the experiences <b>of</b> <b>newspaper</b> distributors in Durban. In identifying the respondents non-probability sampling was used to identify information-rich respondents for interview sections. Also, the research used participant observation to deepen data from interviews. Main Findings : The research finds that the respondents were exposed to precarious employment conditions irrespective of whether they were contracted or not, seemingly because <b>of</b> outsourcing <b>of</b> <b>newspaper</b> distribution in Durban. Practical/Managerial Implications : The practical implication suggests that Basic Employment Act is not guiding how the respondents are being treated. Contribution/Value-Add: The paper specifically highlights the exploitation <b>of</b> <b>newspaper</b> distributors on the streets, as they are denied any form of employment benefits or employment security despite executing their job within severe working conditions...|$|R
5|$|Although other retired {{high-ranking}} officers, including generals James Gavin and Matthew Ridgway, joined Shoup in this, it was Shoup's pointed criticisms {{that regularly}} made {{the front pages}} <b>of</b> <b>newspapers,</b> because they went beyond the war to American government, business, and military leadership. He feared the conflict had endangered the nation's historical identity, and argued increasing the troop levels in Vietnam would only aggravate the strategic problems there. Historian Robert Buzzanco noted that Shoup {{may have been the}} most vocal former military member to oppose the war.|$|E

This shortage caused the News-Miner to run short until Lathrop used his industrial connections to divert a shipment from a newspaper that was going out of business.|$|E
5|$|The often uproarious and {{spectacular}} Cuocolo trial attracted {{a lot of}} attention <b>of</b> <b>newspapers</b> and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States, including by Pathé's Gazette.

Fabbroni intended to use the trial to strike the final blow to the Camorra. The trial was attended by the former mayor of New York City, George B.

5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>newspapers</b> and {{periodicals}} {{are published}} in Hindi, English, and Urdu. The Pioneer {{was founded in}} Allahabad in 1865 by George Allen. Amar Ujala, Dainik Bhaskar, Dainik Jagran, and Hindustan Dainik have a wide circulation, with local editions published from several important cities. Major English language newspapers which are published and sold in large numbers are The Telegraph, The Times of India, Hindustan Times, The Hindu, The Statesman, The Indian Express, and Asian Age. Some prominent financial dailies like The Economic Times, Financial Express, Business Line, and Business Standard are widely circulated. Vernacular newspapers {{such as those in}} Hindi, Nepali, Gujarati, Odia, Urdu, and Punjabi are also read by a select readership.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with other}} major {{periodicals}} of its day, the Analytical Review had a low circulation. While both the Tory Critical Review and the British Critic had {{a circulation of}} 3,500 by 1797 and the Monthly Review realized 5,000, Johnson and Christie's journal only ever achieved about 1,500. However, it was common practice during the eighteenth century for an individual copy of each publication to be read by many different people. Scholars have estimated that each copy of a London newspaper, for example, was read by thirty people; coffeehouses and taverns were well-stocked with copies <b>of</b> <b>newspapers</b> and journals, as were circulating libraries. Hence, circulation numbers offer only a small glimpse into how many people actually read such publications.|$|E

Munroe engaged in wrecking in the waters around Key Biscayne, built sailboats, worked as a pilot for the Cape Florida Channel and opened a pineapple cannery, to which Davis sent his pineapples. Before mail service to the Miami area improved, Munroe would camp out on Key Biscayne every Tuesday evening {{so that he could}} sail out {{to the edge of the}} Gulf Stream early Wednesday morning to retrieve a package <b>of</b> <b>newspapers</b> and magazines dropped for him in waterproof pouches by a passing steamship.
