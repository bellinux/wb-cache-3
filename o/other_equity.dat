The principle of separating alpha and beta investments was introduced by Dalio in 1990 and gained the recognition of <b>other</b> <b>equity</b> managers beginning in the year 2000.

5|$|The Exchequer {{stood on}} an equal footing with the other Westminster courts (the Court of Common Pleas, Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery), with cases {{transferred}} easily from one to another, although there were problems {{in the case of the}} Court of King's Bench. The traditional method for moving a case was the writ of supersedeas, but the King's Bench represented the monarch, who could not have writs placed against him. Instead, a clerk would bring the Red Book of the Exchequer to the King's Bench and assert that the case's claimant was an officer of the Exchequer, necessitating his trial there rather than in the King's Bench. The Exchequer maintained a clear rule with the <b>other</b> <b>equity</b> court, the Court of Chancery; a case heard in one could not be re-heard in the other. Apart from that, cases of equity could be heard by either court. The Exchequer had superior status over inferior courts of equity, able to take cases from them and countermand their decisions. The jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts also overlapped with that of the Exchequer, particularly in relation to the collection of tithes, and there are many records of disputes between the two.|$|E
5|$|Although the IFC's {{shareholders}} initially {{only allowed}} it to make loans, the IFC was authorized in 1961 to make equity investments, {{the first of which}} was made in 1962 by taking a stake in FEMSA, a former manufacturer of auto parts in Spain that is now part of Bosch Spain. The IFC invests in businesses' equity either directly or via private equity funds, generally from five up to twenty percent of a company's total equity. IFC’s private equity portfolio currently stands at roughly $3.0 billion committed to about 180 funds. The portfolio is widely distributed across all regions including Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, and recently has invested in Small Enterprise Assistance Funds' (SEAF) Caucasus Growth Fund, Aureos Capital's Kula Fund II (Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Pacific Islands) and Leopard Capital’s Haiti Fund. <b>Other</b> <b>equity</b> investments made by the IFC include preferred equity, convertible loans, and participation loans. The IFC prefers to invest for the long-term, usually for a period of eight to fifteen years, before exiting through the sale of shares on a domestic stock exchange, usually as part of an initial public offering. When the IFC invests in a company, it does not assume an active role in management of the company.|$|E

25|$|On the {{borrowing}} end, after 10–20 years, the S 500 corporations {{become extremely}} accustomed to obtaining funds via these money markets, {{which are very}} stable. Initially, perhaps they only borrowed in these markets for a highly seasonal cash needs, being a net borrower for only say 90 days per year. They would borrow here as they experienced their deepest cash needs over an operating cycle to temporarily finance short-term build ups in inventory and receivables. Or, they moved to this funding market from a former bank revolving line of credit, that was guaranteed {{to be available to}} them as they needed it, but had to be cleaned up to a zero balance for at least 60 days out of the year.

2500|$|Until the Late Middle Ages {{it was not}} {{apparent}} to contemporaries that there would be, or could be, two different and competing legal systems in England, one of them common law and the <b>other</b> <b>equity.</b> [...] They were, however, aware of the conflicting courts. [...] There was a conflict of jurisdiction. [...] There were numerous complaints that various authorities had exceeded their power. [...] Equity grew in its desire {{to deal with the}} de facto failings of the common law courts, and did not concern itself with doctrinal differences. [...] Often, a suitor who was dissatisfied with the result in a common law court would refile the case in Equity or Chancery. [...] These latter courts saw their role as being [...] "equalizers": [...] socially, legally, economically. [...] In this position, and encouraged by Roman law traditions, they were always creative in producing new writs which could not be found in the common law courts. [...] It was in this spirit that Justice Berrewyk in 1302, ordered an infant to be brought before the court with a writ subpoena: [...] "under pain of (forfeit) of 100 pounds". [...] But there is evidence that [...] "threat of penalty" [...] had been attached to writs used by the government to induce behavior as early as 1232. [...] By 1350, the [...] writ certis de causis (the [...] "writ for certain causes"), began having the clause subpoena routinely attached. [...] The writ quibusdam certis de causis is at least as old at 1346, and had subpoena attached. [...] The great objection which common lawyers made to writs in this form was their failure to mention the cause of the summons. [...] It became the custom in the common law courts that the person would not be compelled to appear without having notice of the reasons for appearing. [...] Early subpoenas carried no notice of the reason for the summons. [...] Objections in Parliament became loud and frequent. [...] On the one hand, Chancery believed that a wrongdoer might engage in maintenance to prepare the verdict before appearing in court. [...] On the other side, common law courts found it difficult to amend the presented writ, and many cases were lost for want of the correct writ {{at the beginning of the}} case.|$|E
