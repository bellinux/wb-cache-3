5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool <b>or</b> <b>something.</b> <b>And</b> describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E
25|$|I {{grew up on}} the Jersey Shore, on {{a little}} barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had come down from the Bureau of Petty Harassment <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> they {{measured}} the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So I thought that was pretty stupid right there.|$|E
500|$|His wife, {{a native}} of the former Soviet Union who had no {{memories}} or expectations like his, saw things with fresh eyes. [...] "She's a nurse and goes between floors at hospitals. At one point she turned to me at some princess fair <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> said, 'This is worse than working the psych [...] at the hospital.'" ...|$|E

500|$|On September 4, 2008, keyboardist and vocalist Kevin Moore {{posted a}} news update to the {{official}} Chroma Key website. In it, he stated {{that he had been}} working with guitarist Jim Matheos on a third OSI album [...] "for several months now, slowly but surely." [...] Moore later stated that with OSI, he and Matheos [...] "usually play it by ear. We never really know if we're going to do another OSI, we never agree on it. I don't remember ever agreeing to start a new one, really. But Jim will send me an idea <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> we just start talking about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Docter {{revealed}} that the filmmakers' first story outline had Carl [...] "just want to join his wife up in the sky. It was almost a kind of strange suicide mission <b>or</b> <b>something.</b> <b>And</b> obviously that's [...] Once he gets airborne, then what? So {{we had to have}} some goal for him to achieve that he had not yet gotten." [...] As a result, they added the plot of going to South America. The location was chosen due to both Docter's love of tropical locations, but also in wanting a location that Carl could be stuck with a kid due to the inability to leave him with an authority such as a police officer or social worker. They implemented a child character as a way to help Carl stop being [...] "stuck in his ways".|$|E
500|$|Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives {{was named}} {{as one of}} the best albums of 2001 by several publications, {{including}} Pitchfork, Ottawa Citizen and Rolling Stone. The Globe & Mail named it the seventh best album of the year, with Carl Wilson writing that [...] "of all the electronica-glich-IDM this year, [...] is the only one I go back to as if it were the Rolling Stones." [...] In 2005, Pitchfork ranked the album the 84th best of 2000-2004. Herren was overwhelmed with the positive reception the album received, exclaiming that [...] "Most of it was so positive, but I'd also get a really strong reaction from people- some that want to kill me, 'cause they're under the impression that I'm trying to kill hip hop <b>or</b> <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> I'm like 'uh see ya, whatever man.'" ...|$|E

500|$|On Behind the Bin, a making-of {{documentary}} about Dustbin Baby, Wilson said that [...] "lots {{and lots of}} people will identify with" [...] the central theme of adoption, as at fourteen [...] "you start to look at your mum and dad and think 'I'm nothing like them', and everyone seems to have fantasies about that they were adopted <b>or</b> <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> so I think that it's a typical teenage thing that you question who you are". Richards says that she likes the idea that April [...] "went on a journey to try and find herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E
500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by Norman Mailer's 1980 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Executioner's Song, written about serial killer Gary Gilmore, and by Truman Capote's 1966 novel In Cold Blood; [...] "Executioner's Song" [...] was the track's working title. [...] Lead singer Bono had read both novels and {{wanted to try to}} write [...] "a story in the mind of a killer". Further reading of Flannery O'Connor and Raymond Carver caused him to try to understand [...] "the ordinary stock first and then the outsiders, the driftwood – those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream." [...] Bono described the lyrics as [...] "just a short story really, except I left out a few of the verses because I liked it as a sketch. It's just about a guy who gets an idea into his head. He picks it up off a preacher on the radio <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> goes out...". He noted that, although 30 songs were in contention for inclusion on the album, he [...] "wanted a song with that sense of violence in it, especially before 'Mothers of the Disappeared'." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, American singer Alicia Keys {{confirmed}} that {{she worked on}} Madonna's upcoming studio album, saying [...] "It was good. I was in here doing a meeting <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> [...] was working with Diplo. They were like, 'Oh, maybe you can play some piano on this thing'. And I was like, 'Alright. I'll try. If you hate it, {{you can take it}} off'. It was just like that, casual and cool." [...] Annie from the London Community Gospel Choir provided the female background vocals throughout the song. Madonna also mentioned that new versions would be [...] "coming out, but just not yet". Describing the song as [...] "one of [...] more mellow productions", Madonna composed [...] "Living for Love" [...] as a break-up song, commenting, [...] "lots of people write about being in love and being happy or they write about having a broken heart and being inconsolable. But nobody writes about having a broken heart and being hopeful and triumphant afterwards. So I thought, how can I do this? I didn't want to share the sentiment of being a victim. This scenario devastated me, but it just made me stronger". She complemented saying that [...] "Living for Love" [...] was [...] "kind of like the old me and the new me all mixed in together".|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked to}} comment on the {{departure}} of team members in August 2013, Carroll stated, [...] "When people quit for other companies for just more money, <b>or</b> <b>something,</b> that's stupid. But, if someone quits because they don't feel right on a team, <b>or</b> <b>something,</b> then, <b>and</b> for another company, that makes sense." ...|$|R
5000|$|I’ve {{always thought}} that The Wedding Present was an {{inappropriate}} name for a pop band — more like a poem, or a book <b>or</b> <b>something</b> — <b>and</b> therefore quite attractive (to me!). I’ve also always been fascinated by weddings...|$|R
5000|$|The {{title of}} the poem [...] "Base Details"- Base {{possibly}} meaning a military base and Details could be a command assignment, someone <b>or</b> <b>something</b> lowly."fierce; <b>and</b> bald, and short of breath" [...] {{this would be a}} stereotypical World War I officer.|$|R
500|$|However, {{the extent}} that Ignition were {{willing to go to}} control access to the album {{generated}} more hype than could normally have been expected, and served to alienate members of both the print and broadcast media, as well as most Creation staff members. When [...] "D'You Know What I Mean?" [...] was planned as the first single, Ignition decided on a late release to radio so as to avoid too much advance exposure. However, three stations broke the embargo, and Ignition panicked. According to Greengrass: [...] "we'd been in these bloody bunker meetings for six months <b>or</b> <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> our plot was blown. 'Shit, it's a nightmare'." [...] BBC Radio 1 received a CD containing three songs ten days before the album's release, on condition that disc jockey Steve Lamacq talked over the tracks to prevent illegal copies being made by listeners. The day after Lamacq previewed the album on his show, he {{received a phone call from}} Ignition informing him that he would not be able to preview further tracks because he didn't speak enough over the songs. Lamacq said, [...] "I had to go on the air the next night and say, 'Sorry, but we're not getting any more tracks.' It was just absurd." [...] According to Creation's head of marketing John Andrews, [...] " [...] made people despise Oasis within Creation. You had this Oasis camp that was like 'I'm sorry, you're not allowed come into the office between the following hours. You're not allowed mention the word Oasis.' It was like a fascist state." [...] One employee recalled an incident [...] "when somebody came round to check our phones because they thought The Sun had tapped them." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today was {{critical}} of the episode, writing [...] "It is possible [...] has worn out the Treehouse franchise. [...] three installments just seem to be reaching for jokes that aren't there, and falling in the attempt. [...] As you'd hope from The Simpsons, the segments all boast a few clever moments {{that will make you}} smile if not laugh. But they're not scary, they're not particularly funny, and outside of some tepid Twilight jokes, they're no longer even trying to be real parodies of the original stories." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also gave the episode a negative review, and felt that [...] "There were laughs in all three segments, but the episode as a whole left something to be desired. The first [...] eventually descended into a long string of mostly lame board game jokes, as if the writers had been coming up with board game puns for the last 15 seasons <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> wanted an excuse to unload a bunch of them all at once. The idea of Bart and Milhouse playing with a Ouija board ripoff was promising, so to see it descend into gags about Marge getting sucked into Clue was disappointing. There were fewer good gags [...] than in the board game segment, but it was balanced out by a fairly solid Hugh Laurie performance. Fortunately, the last segment, the inevitable Twilight parody, was funny across the board, both in how it took the piss out of the Twilight films and how it satirized vampire mania. [...] Still, it wasn't the best [...] "Treehouse" [...] ever, and you could make a good claim for it being the worst, particularly if the Twilight segment wasn't in there." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2010, Phillips denied {{reports that}} the film would take place in Mexico or Thailand stating, [...] "I don't know. There's a lot of rumors. There was rumor also {{that it was going}} to Mexico <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> neither are true". Also by March, Galifianakis, Helms, Bradley Cooper and Justin Bartha {{completed}} negotiations and signed deals to reprise their roles in the sequel.|$|E
2500|$|In {{everyday}} law, [...] "witness" [...] means {{someone who}} sees <b>or</b> observes <b>something</b> <b>and</b> [...] "declarant" [...] means someone who says something under oath. The distinctions in {{the definitions of}} these words {{is important to consider}} in hearsay law.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of rigging: dynamic and static.

50|$|Both Halsbury's and Spencer Bower (see below) {{describe}} {{these three}} estoppels collectively as estoppels by representation. More simply, one party must say <b>or</b> do <b>something</b> <b>and</b> {{see the other}} party rely on what is said or done to change behavior.|$|R
2500|$|The second show I {{ever saw}} of the Descendents {{was at the}} Dancing Waters in San Pedro. They broke into the set and he was playing guitar so hard and so angry that his pants fell down. He was an odd character, for sure. I can {{remember}} standing in line at a Misfits show {{and all of a}} sudden he just sat down on the ground and started holding his head like his ears were ringing <b>or</b> <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> said something to the effect of [...] "What am I doing here? Where am I?" [...] So that was Frank.|$|E
2500|$|Lennon first {{conceived}} [...] "Please Please Me" [...] as a bluesy, slow tempo song. Lennon recalled: [...] "I {{remember the}} day I wrote it, I heard Roy Orbison doing 'Only the Lonely', <b>or</b> <b>something.</b> <b>And</b> I was also always intrigued by the words to a Bing Crosby song that went, 'Please lend a little ear to my pleas'. The double {{use of the word}} 'please'. So {{it was a combination of}} Roy Orbison and Bing Crosby". Originally it was vocally sparse, did not contain any harmonies or responses, nor did it have the scaled harmonica intro.|$|E
2500|$|The amplified {{stringed}} instruments, {{especially the}} steel guitar, gave the music its distinctive sound. As early as 1934 or 1935 Bob Dunn electrified a Martin O-series acoustic guitar while playing with Milton Brown's Brownies. According to Jimmy Thomason, [...] "It happened when Dunn {{was working at}} Coney Island in New York...he ran into this black guy who was playing a steel guitar with a homemade pickup attached to it...hooked up to this old radio <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> was playing blues licks...and he got this guy to show him how he was doing it. I never knew this black musician's name but both Bob and Avis {{talked to me about}} him often." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} types, states Zarrilli, {{reflect the}} Guṇa theory of personalities {{in the ancient}} Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy. There are three Guṇas, according to this philosophy, that have always been {{and continue to be}} present in all things and beings in the world. These three Guṇas are [...] (goodness, constructive, harmonious, virtuous), [...] (passion, aimless action, dynamic, egoistic), and [...] (darkness, destructive, chaotic, viciousness). All of these three gunas (good, evil, active) are present in everyone and everything, it is the proportion that is different, according to Hindu worldview. The interplay of these gunas defines the character of someone <b>or</b> <b>something,</b> <b>and</b> the costumes and face coloring in Kathakali often combines the various color codes to give complexity and depth to the actor-dancers.|$|E
2500|$|In {{regard to}} this trend, Raekwon later {{clarified}} [...] "We {{was the first to}} be talking that Cristal shit. I know that for a fact. Back then we would go do dinners and sit with Loud Records president Steve Rifkind and them up at the label. And our mission would be like, when we sit at the table, we want the best fuckin' wine they got in the building. We might have asked for some Mo <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> they didn't have it. So we was like [...] "What the fuck is the next best thing, Steve?" [...] And Steve's like 'Give 'em the next best thing.' They came out with Cristal. Me and Ghost liked the bottle, and the name on the bottle was Louie Roederer. I was like, I'm Lou Diamond, Louie Roederer. Me and Ghost is loving how the bottle looked. It cost more than the muthafuckin' other, so we was like, Cristal, nigga! That's our new shit!" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the trial}} in November 1929, Shuler's lawyer cross-examined Cryer about {{allegations}} that he [...] "pitched dice at in Farmer Page's place," [...] and about his accumulation of wealth during his eight years as mayor. [...] Cryer testified {{that he had a}} personal fortune of $160,000 when he took office in 1921 and left office in 1929 with a personal wealth of $450,000 which Cryer credited to [...] "realty deals absolutely uninfluenced by his political position." [...] Asked if he had ever taken a bribe, Cryer replied: [...] "No, sir; never at any time, directly or indirectly. [...] I never profited by my office. [...] In fact, I considered it a financial detriment. [...] It was the darndest job I ever had. [...] It took practically all of my time, Sundays and every other day, and most of the night. [...] I had to take the telephone out of my house so I could get a little sleep. [...] I used to come home at nights from a banquet <b>or</b> <b>something</b> <b>and</b> people would call me sometimes at 3 o'clock in the morning -- some of them apparently insane." ...|$|E
5000|$|Plush (from French [...] ) is {{a textile}} having a cut nap or pile {{the same as}} fustian or velvet. Its {{softness}} of feel {{gave rise to the}} adjective [...] "plush" [...] to describe <b>something</b> soft <b>or</b> luxurious, which was extended to describe luxury accommodation, <b>or</b> <b>something</b> rich <b>and</b> full.|$|R
50|$|Stinky tofu is {{fermented}} tofu. Like {{blue cheese}} or durian, {{it has a}} very distinct, potent smell, and is an acquired taste. Hard stinky tofu is often deep-fried and paired with soy sauce <b>or</b> <b>something</b> salty <b>and</b> spicy. Soft stinky tofu usually be used as a spread on steamed buns.|$|R
60|$|Indeed one {{difference}} between true and false repentance lieth in this. The man that truly repents crieth {{out of his}} heart; but the other, as Eve, upon the serpent, <b>or</b> <b>something</b> else. <b>And</b> that the Publican perceived his heart to be naught I conclude, by his smiting upon his breast.|$|R
