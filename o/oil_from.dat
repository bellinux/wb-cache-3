In the <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> the stem barks, the authors showed that monoterpenes were present in higher proportions (90.02 %). Ribeiro et al.

40|$|Stem and ear rot {{caused by}} Stenocarpella maydis are {{responsible}} for severe losses in maize production. Treatment of seeds with fungicides may induce environmental damage. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of essential <b>oils</b> extracted <b>from</b> Cymbopogon winterianus, Thymus vulgaris, Cymbopogon citratus, Corymbia citriodora, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and Syzygium aromaticum {{on the development of}} in vitro S. maydis. In addition, maize seeds were treated with these essential oils to determine their possible mode of action and effects. The <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> S. aromaticum, C. zeylanicum, and T. vulgaris inhibited fungal development at concentrations higher than 0. 025 %. The <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> S. aromaticum and C. zeylanicum showed seed germination rates of 89. 0 % and 84. 5 %, which were higher than that of the control. The <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> S. aromaticum and C. zeylanicum reduced the pathogen incidence in the seeds to 39. 0 % and 28. 0 %, respectively. Further, these oils as well as that from T. vulgaris produced lower reduction of maize stand. Scanning electron microscopy examination revealed that essential <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> S. aromaticum and T. vulgaris acted directly on the conidia, impeding germination. The findings suggest that the <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> S. aromaticum, C. zeylanicum, and T. vulgaris are potential alternatives for maize seed treatment in the control of S. maydis...|$|R
30|$|Due {{to the big}} {{quantity}} of chemical compounds present in the essential <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> D. brasiliensis, the PCA technique (Principal Component Analysis) was chosen to check the similarity between the essential <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> the fresh leaves (FF), dry leaves (FS) and fresh branches (G) in two altitude levels, regarding the proportions of their chemical constituents.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{discrimination}} study {{based on the}} antioxidant compounds, oxidative stability, aroma and sensory profiles of virgin olive <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> the main Tunisian cultivars, Chemlali and Chétoui, grown in two different locations, north and south Tunisia, with important differences in altitude, latitude and climatic conditions. There were {{significant differences between the}} <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> both cultivars when grown in the different environments. At higher altitude, the oils showed a greater amount of oleic acid, phenols and a higher stability, whilst in the open the oils had higher saturated and linoleic acid content. Aroma profiles were also influenced by the pedoclimatic conditions; hence, <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> the South had the highest level of (E) - 2 -hexenal and 1 -hexanol, whereas varieties from the North were higher in (E) - 3 -hexenyl acetate and hexyl acetate. In general, and independently of the growing area conditions, <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> Chétoui olives had higher levels of antioxidants, greater oxidative stability, higher antiradical activities and more marked intensity of bitterness. These results can be used to discriminate and to characterise the Chemlali and Chétoui olive <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> each region...|$|R

There were {{significant differences between the}} <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> both cultivars when grown in the different environments, Cabra close to the hills and Mengibar in the open at 280 m height. At higher altitude, the oils showed a greater content of oleic acid and higher stability, while in the open the oils had higher tocopherol and linoleic acid contents. For the phenolic compounds, the environment influenced each cultivar in different ways. Sensorial characteristics, showed significant differences between the <b>oils</b> <b>from</b> each cultivar and location.
