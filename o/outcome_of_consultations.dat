Here the potential monetary benefits of early flood warnings using the example of the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) are calculated based on pan-European Flood damage data and calculations of potential flood damage reductions. The benefits are of the order of 400 Euro for every 1 Euro invested. Because of the uncertainties which accompany the calculation, a large sensitivity analysis is performed in order to develop an envelope of possible financial benefits. Current EFAS system skill is compared against perfect forecasts to demonstrate the importance of further improving the skill of the forecasts.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients often {{present in}} primary care with {{physical}} symptoms that doctors cannot readily explain. The process of reassuring these patients is challenging, complex and poorly understood. AIM: To construct a typology of general practitioners' (GPs') normalising explanations, based on their effect on the process and <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> involving patients with medically unexplained symptoms. DESIGN OF STUDY: Qualitative analysis of audiotaped consultations between patients and GPs. SETTING: Seven general practices in Merseyside, United Kingdom. METHODS: Transcripts of audiotaped consultations between 21 GPs and 36 patients with medically unexplained symptoms were analysed inductively, to identify types of normalising speech used by GPs. RESULTS: Normalisation without explanation included rudimentary reassurance and the authority of a negative test result. Patients persisted in requesting explanation and elaborated or extended their symptoms, rendering somatic management more likely. Normalisation with ineffective explanation provided a tangible physical explanation for symptoms, unrelated to patient's expressed concerns. This was also counterproductive. Normalisation with effective explanation provided tangible mechanisms grounded in patients' concerns, often linking physical and psychological factors. These explanations were accepted by patients; those linking physical and psychological factors contributed to psychosocial management outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The routine exercise of normalisation by GPs contains approaches that are ineffective and may exacerbate patients' presentation. However, it also contains types of explanation that may {{reduce the need for}} symptomatic investigation or treatment. These findings can inform the development of well-grounded educational interventions for GPs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There is {{worldwide}} {{interest in}} managing the global burden of long-term conditions. Current health policy places emphasis on self-management and supporting patient participation as ways of improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. However, achieving genuine participation is difficult. This paper describes {{the development of an}} intervention designed to promote participation in the consultation and facilitate self-management in long-term conditions. In line with current guidance on the development of complex interventions, our aim was to develop and refine the initial intervention using qualitative methods, prior to more formal evaluation. Methods We based the intervention on published evidence on effective ways of improving participation. The intervention was developed, piloted and evaluated using a range of qualitative methods. Firstly, focus groups with stakeholders (5 patients and 3 clinicians) were held to introduce the prototype and elucidate how it could be improved. Then individual 'think aloud' and qualitative interviews (n = 10) were used to explore how patients responded to and understood the form and provide further refinement. Results The literature highlighted that effective methods of increasing participation include the use of patient reported outcome measures and values clarification exercises. The intervention (called PRISMS) integrated these processes, using a structured form which required patients to identify problems, rate their magnitude and identify their priority. PRISMS was well received by patients and professionals. In the individual qualitative interviews the main themes that emerged from the data related to (a) the content of the PRISMS (b) the process of completing PRISMS and how it could be operationalised in practice and (c) the outcomes of completing PRISMS for the patient. A number of different functions of PRISMS were identified by patients including its use as an aide-memoire, to provide a focus to consultations, to give permission to discuss certain issues, and to provide greater tailoring for the patient. Conclusions There was evidence that patients found the PRISMS form acceptable and potentially useful. The challenge encountered by patients in completing PRISMS may encourage exploration of these issues within the consultation, complementing the more 'task focussed' aspects of consultations resulting from introduction of clinical guidelines and financial incentives. Further research is required to provide a rigorous assessment of the ability of tools like PRISMS to achieve genuine change in the process and <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>consultations.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|Background and aims. Patients’ {{consultations}} with GPs {{can deal with}} a wide range of conditions and problems. Generally, consultation outcomes have been considered in evaluations but outcome has a meaning for elaboration of care beyond the graduating role of quality and other evaluation instruments. Knowledge about outcomes is needed for understanding and development. The aim of this thesis was to investigate outcomes of GPs’ consultations as directly experienced by patients and GPs and to investigate connections between clinical strategies and presumed patient outcomes. Methods. First, concepts describing outcomes from patients’ and GPs’ viewpoints were developed from interviews in groups and individually. Secondly, based on this, questionnaires about the consultation outcomes were formulated. Then, patients and GPs answered questionnaires regarding the same recent consultation. The numbers of the different outcomes were counted and the experiences of outcomes from the same consultations were compared. Finally, another questionnaire including both the GP outcome questions and questions about the clinical situation and decisions made was answered by GPs. Results. Concepts describing consultation outcomes were brought forward. Cure/symptom relief, reassurance, patient understanding and satisfaction were used by both patients and GPs to describe <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>consultations.</b> Only patients described as outcomes a confirmation of their ideas and a change in self-perception. GPs, but not patients, described the patient outcomes in terms of check-up and coping. Besides this, GPs also described other outcomes that concerned relationship-building, a change of surgery routines and self-evaluation. Selfevaluation was related to a perceived collegial consensus about right and wrong. The concordance between GPs and patients assessing the same consultations was high for satisfaction, intermediate for patient understanding and low for belief in cure/symptom relief. Clinical strategies were linked to outcomes. Immediate problem solving was registered in about half the consultations. When immediate problem solving was registered the patients were supposed to be more reassured, satisfied and coped better than after gradual problem solving. With increasing psychosocial content of the consultation the GPs registered more dissatisfaction both for themselves and their patients. Conclusions. Change in self- perception was a prominent patient outcome. GPs’ self-evaluations ought to have the inherent possibility to serve as a basis for development of general practice. The entire map of the encountered outcome concepts can serve as a basis for further research and development. The mapping of concepts can be of help when prioritising. Knowledge about the total picture of consultation outcomes can help the GP to understand the patients’ worlds better. It can also contribute to a realistic picture of possible consultation outcomes. The GPs seemed to adjust their problem solving (immediate or gradual) to the registered problem and furthermore adjust the immediate problem solving, focusing either on the problem or on the patient as a person...|$|E

Based on an analysis <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> documents, this article looks at councils&rsquo; understanding <b>of</b> community <b>consultation</b> and underlying assumptions, the expected outcomes and how this is translated into guidance for practice. The research demonstrates that councils aim to consult to provide a range <b>of</b> <b>outcomes,</b> {{but there is a}} lack of clarity about how to choose and use the appropriate combination <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> tool(s) and public(s) to facilitate these.
