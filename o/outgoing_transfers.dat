5000|$|The first {{transfer}} {{was announced}} already in March 2016, {{when it was}} released that second goalkeeper Yves Lenaerts had signed for ASV Geel in search for more playing opportunity. This proved to be just the first outgoing transfer of many, as following the relegation from the Belgian Pro League on 13 March 2016, several players left the team: Brazilian defender Kanu saw his contract terminated by mutual consent {{just a few days}} after the relegation, over the summer three key players were sold, namely John Bostock (to Lens [...] ), Yohan Croizet (to Mechelen [...] ) and Jordan Remacle (to Antwerp [...] ). The loan deals of Samuel Asamoah, Charni Ekangamene, Leandro Trossard, Slobodan Urošević and Oleksandr Volovyk were not extended, youngster Konstantinos Rougalas was allowed to leave the club and return to Greece [...] and the contracts of Frenchmen Jean Calvé and Rudy Riou, striker Kim Ojo and defender Kenny Van Hoevelen were either terminated or not prolonged.

50|$|The Bees' form {{picked up}} again late January 1928, though the club could not finish any higher than 12th. Youngster Joe Wiggins broke Brentford's <b>outgoing</b> <b>transfer</b> record in April, with Leicester City paying £1,400 for a centre forward {{who had made}} just four senior appearances, scoring two goals. Jack Phillips {{finished}} the season as he began it, with 9 goals in 10 matches, to finish as top-scorer with 18 goals.

5000|$|There {{had been}} heavy {{transfer}} costs incurred in 1974-75 {{with the club}} recording a loss of £448,342 and therefore now in debt despite {{an increase in the}} average attendance. Geoff Hurst was sold to West Bromwich Albion for £20,000, the only <b>outgoing</b> <b>transfer</b> for cash in the summer of 1975, although two other notable departures were those of club record goalscorer John Ritchie who retired after finding the back of the net a record 176 times for the [...] "Potters" [...] and also goalkeeper John Farmer.

50|$|During the {{transfer}} window, {{a number of}} players left Spurs, beginning with young goalkeeper Lee Butcher, leaving to join Leyton Orient on a free transfer after his contract expired at Tottenham, followed a month later by defender Sam Cox signing a contract with Barnet, again, following the expiration of his Spurs contract. Soon after, a number of fringe and academy players, including veteran goalkeeper Jimmy Walker, left the club on free transfers. In early August, Queens Park Rangers completed the permanent signing of Adel Taarabt for a fee believed to be around £1 million; Taarabt had spent to 2009-10 season on loan at QPR before sealing a permanent deal. Tottenham's final permanent <b>outgoing</b> <b>transfer</b> of the summer transfer window saw French defender Dorian Dervite move to Spanish club Villarreal for an undisclosed fee.|$|R
50|$|The {{rules for}} the {{registration}} of non-EU (or non-EFTA or Swiss) nationals transferred from abroad were revised {{in the summer of}} 2010 and announced on 2 July 2010. Clubs could only sign one (rather than two previously) non-EU player and that player could only be signed if a current member of the squad who was not an EU national had been sold or sold abroad. The late announcement of this rule change meant that some clubs had to cancel incoming transfers. Parma, for example, were to sign both Colombian Pablo Armero from Brazilian side Palmeiras, who subsequently signed for Udinese instead, and Brazilian agency player Zé Eduardo, but had to choose between them and eventually transferred the latter. Their <b>outgoing</b> <b>transfer</b> was Julio César de León, who moved to Chinese team Shandong Luneng Taishan.|$|R
50|$|After {{a disappointing}} end {{to what was}} a {{positive}} first full season in charge, Brentford manager Steve Perryman identified that his principle starting XI would be complete with a creative winger and a reliable goalscoring forward. Perryman broke the Bees' incoming transfer record in July 1988, after spending £77,500 on Sheffield United forward Richard Cadette. Perryman brought experienced winger Neil Smillie back to Griffin Park, 11 years after Smillie had initially played for the Bees on loan. Also arriving at Griffin Park was goalkeeper Tony Parks from Tottenham Hotspur for a £60,000 fee and replaced Gary Phillips, who joined Reading for £25,000. On {{the eve of the}} season, right back Roger Joseph, who had been named in the 1987-88 Third Division PFA Team of the Year, joined Wimbledon for a new club record <b>outgoing</b> <b>transfer</b> fee of £150,000.|$|R

After making 11 domestic league appearances in his first season as a professional, he went on to find his place as a regular with NK Zagreb. During the following two seasons, he made a total of 52 domestic league appearances and scored a total of nine domestic league goals for the club, eight of which came during the 1999-2000 season. In the summer of 2000 Banović went on to leave NK Zagreb in all-time record high <b>outgoing</b> <b>transfer</b> fee of 1.900.000 euros for German Bundesliga side Werder Bremen [...]|$|R
50|$|McMahon arrived {{too late}} to save the club from relegation to the Third Division (fourth tier) after a 22nd-placed finish in the table. In his first full season in charge, Blackpool were {{promoted}} to Division Two by winning the play-offs. The following season the club received its then record <b>outgoing</b> <b>transfer</b> fee; £1.75million from Southampton for Brett Ormerod, eclipsing the £600,000 QPR paid for Trevor Sinclair eight years earlier. They also gained the first of two Football League Trophy wins in 2002 as Blackpool beat Cambridge United 4-1 at the Millennium Stadium. Their second win was in 2004, this time beating Southend United 2-0 again in Cardiff. In the summer following the Trophy win, McMahon resigned, believing he could not take the club any further with the budget he was being offered. Colin Hendry became the new manager, but was replaced by Simon Grayson in November 2005 after an unsuccessful stint which left Blackpool languishing just above the relegation zone of League One (third tier).|$|R
50|$|A 3-0 defeat to Millwall on {{the opening}} day saw Brentford begin the season bottom of the Second Division and despite {{registering}} two wins in late-August and early-September to move into mid-table, just two wins in the following 13 matches in all competitions saw May and Walker removed from their posts on 4 November. Amidst rumours that David Webb had fallen out with chairman Swaisland, Webb resigned as chief executive, but remained {{on the board of}} directors. Former Swansea City manager Micky Adams was installed as manager and fared little better, failing to win until mid-December. In a bid to strengthen the team, Adams sought experienced players, signing Glenn Cockerill as player/assistant manager, Warren Aspinall and loanee Nigel Gleghorn. Injuries soon began to mount, with first-choice right back Ijah Anderson and summer signings Derek Bryan and Ricky Reina succumbing. Continuing player sales and bad results led some Bees supporters to call for the removal of David Webb, staging multiple protests over a disparity between the incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>transfer</b> fees and questioning where the incoming money was going.|$|R

50|$|This issue can be {{addressed}} {{in one of two}} ways in system design: Cache-coherent systems implement a method in hardware whereby external writes are signaled to the cache controller which then performs a cache invalidation for DMA writes or cache flush for DMA reads. Non-coherent systems leave this to software, where the OS must then ensure that the cache lines are flushed before an <b>outgoing</b> DMA <b>transfer</b> is started and invalidated before a memory range affected by an incoming DMA transfer is accessed. The OS must make sure that the memory range is not accessed by any running threads in the meantime. The latter approach introduces some overhead to the DMA operation, as most hardware requires a loop to invalidate each cache line individually.|$|R

50|$|Though things quickly {{appeared}} to have settled on surface, the situation festered behind the scenes for months as PSV was in a league title race while Lemić's role in the club was simultaneously publicly questioned courtesy of leaked information to the press by the Reker camp. Lemić didn't hold back either as his client Heurelho Gomes' stinging attack on Reker in a Voetbal International interview, conducted {{just days after the}} title got clinched on 20 April 2008, was seen {{by many to be the}} agent's revenge by proxy. The club management and supervisory boards reacted in a harshly worded statement posted on the club's official website, condemning Gomes' action. Appalled by the situation and irritated by Reker, 73-year-old scout Piet de Visser resigned his post and left the club within a week. By the summer 2008 off-season, the agent and the general manager were engaged in a full blown public war. Many things that normally happen behind closed doors were now all out in the open as Reker moved to rid the club of any Lemić influence. Influenced by Reker, the club alleged that Lemić and Valckx pocketed profits from their deals for PSV. When a transfer was made at the club, Lemić would allegedly send a hefty bill to the PSV office, even when no one was aware of his involvement. He reportedly claimed services rendered like 'cooling off the interest of club X in player Y' to keep transfer prices down or making a supposed bid by a foreign club for a PSV-player fade away. Meanwhile, following an investigation by NRC Handelsblad reporters, it also came out that technical director Valckx's contract with PSV, in addition to his salary terms, contained a stipulation earning him five per cent of every <b>outgoing</b> <b>transfer</b> at the club — a provision apparently signed off on by the club's former president Harry van Raay without the knowledge of the club's supervisory board. Though no wrongdoing was ever proven, Lemić got banned from the club's training ground while Valckx got fired.|$|R
