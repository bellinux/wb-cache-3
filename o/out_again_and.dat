5|$|At {{the time}} of the Domesday Survey, the manor was owned by King William, and was the {{principal}} settlement of the largest and wealthiest hundred in Somerset. Over the following years, parts of the original manor were spun off as distinct manors; for example, one was owned by the minster, later passing to the Abbey at Cirencester, which others were leased by the Crown to important families. By the 13th century, the Abbey had bought up some of the other manors (although it did let them <b>out</b> <b>again)</b> <b>and</b> was exploiting the profits from market and trade in the town. Local tradition asserts that Frome was a medieval borough, and the reeve of Frome is occasionally mentioned in documents after the reign of Edward I, but there is no direct evidence that Frome was a borough and no trace of any charter granted to it. However, the Kyre Park Charters of Edward's reign note a Hugh, lord of Parva (or little) Frome, as well as other witnesses. Additionally, Henry VII did grant a charter to Edmund Leversedge, then lord of the manor, giving him the right to hold fairs on 22 July and 21 September. The parish was part of the hundred of Frome.|$|E
5|$|Having {{spent the}} winter {{alone on the}} ocean, {{it is unclear whether}} the Atlantic puffin meets its {{previous}} partner offshore or whether they encounter each other when they return to their nest of the previous year. On land, they soon set about improving and clearing out the burrow. Often, one stands outside the entrance while the other excavates, kicking out quantities of soil and grit that showers the partner standing outside. Some birds collect stems and fragments of dry grasses as nesting materials but others do not bother. Sometimes a beakful of materials is taken underground, only to be brought <b>out</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> discarded. Apart from nest-building, the other way in which the birds restore their bond is by billing. This is a practice in which the pair approach each other, each wagging its head from side to side, and then rattle their beaks together. This seems to be an important element of their courtship behaviour because it happens repeatedly, and the birds continue to bill, to a lesser extent, throughout the breeding season.|$|E

5|$|In France, Napoleon was massing {{forces to}} invade Great Britain. After a brief spell in London, where he again visited the Hamiltons, Nelson {{was placed in}} charge of {{defending}} the English Channel to prevent the invasion. He spent the summer reconnoitring the French coast, but apart from a failed attack on Boulogne in August, saw little action. On 22 October 1801 the Peace of Amiens was signed between the British and the French, and Nelson – in poor health again – retired to Britain where he stayed with Sir William and Lady Hamilton. On 30 October Nelson spoke {{in support of the}} Addington government in the House of Lords, and afterwards made regular visits to attend sessions. The three embarked on a tour of England and Wales, visiting Birmingham, Warwick, Gloucester, Swansea, Monmouth and numerous other towns and villages. Nelson often found himself received as a hero and was the centre of celebrations and events held in his honour. In 1802, Nelson bought Merton Place, a country estate in Merton, Surrey (now south-west London) where he lived briefly with the Hamiltons until William's death in April 1803. The following month, war broke <b>out</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> Nelson prepared to return to sea.|$|E

25|$|The harbour head is {{a hostile}} place. Big waves from the Tasman Sea break over large sandbanks about five metres below the surface, {{two to five}} {{kilometres}} from the shore. The sand in these sandbanks comes mainly from the Waikato River. Sand discharged from this river is transported northward by the prevailing coastal currents. Some of this sand is carried into the Kaipara harbour entrance, but mostly cycles <b>out</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> then continues moving northwards along the west coast. The southern sandbanks at the entrance are constantly accumulating and releasing this sand.|$|E

The army was camped in a battle formation and the Yellow Jackets were placed on the far right flank. Early on the morning of November 7, the Indians in Prophetstown launched a preemptive strike on the army.|$|E

After twice appearing off Amherstburg, Perry established an anchorage at Put-in-Bay, Ohio. For {{the next five}} weeks, Barclay was effectively blockaded and unable to move supplies to Amherstburg. His sailors, Procter's troops, and the very large numbers of Indian warriors and their families there quickly ran out of supplies. After receiving a last-minute reinforcement of two naval officers, three warrant officers and 36 sailors transferred from a transport temporarily laid up in Quebec under Lieutenant George Bignall, Barclay {{had no choice but}} to put <b>out</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> seek battle with Perry.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, piracy along the East and Gulf Coasts of North America {{as well as}} in the Caribbean {{increased}} again. Jean Lafitte was just one of hundreds of pirates operating in American and Caribbean waters between the years of 1820 and 1835. The United States Navy repeatedly engaged pirates in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and in the Mediterranean. Cofresí's El Mosquito was disabled in a collaboration between Spain and the United States. After fleeing for hours, he was ambushed and captured inland. The United States landed shore parties on several islands in the Caribbean in pursuit of pirates; Cuba was a major haven. By the 1830s piracy had died <b>out</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> the navies of the region focused on the slave trade.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{then went}} to his vehicle, which was just past the coaches, and changed weapons to the self loading rifle. He fired at Denise Cromer, who was near the penitentiary ruins. Gravel flew {{up in front of}} her as the bullets hit the ground. Bryant then got in his car and sat there for a few moments before getting <b>out</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> going back to the coaches. Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant could see them and the cars did not provide much cover. When they {{realized}} Bryant had seen them, they ran into the bush. He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{following}} Jericho's win, Austin {{came back}} out to wrestle the final. Angle attacked him while The Rock went to attack Jericho with a Rock Bottom and chased Angle to the back. The match began with spearing Jericho. The two fought off outside the ring and on the announce table. Jericho took Austin {{to the top of}} table where Austin tried to hit a Stone Cold Stunner. Jericho countered it into the Walls of Jericho but Austin flipped him off the table. On the floor, he suplexed Jericho and tossed him into the ring. The two fought out of the ring, and Jericho threw Austin shoulder-first into the ringpost. Jericho wrapped Austin's arm into an armbar, and used the ropes for leverage, but the referee broke the hold. Jericho attempted a flying forearm smash, but Austin ducked, and Jericho hit the referee. Jericho hit a low blow and a Stone Cold Stunner. McMahon came <b>out</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> ordered Nick Patrick to referee the match. However, Ric Flair interfered and pulled Patrick out of the ring and attacked him. McMahon knocked Flair into the ringpost. Austin then hit a low blow, and assaulted McMahon. He hit a Lou Thesz press on Jericho and applied the Walls of Jericho. Jericho tapped out but the referee was down. Booker T came out and hit Austin with the WWF Championship belt. The referee recovered and Jericho pinned Austin to win the match, and became the first ever Undisputed WWF Champion in the World Wrestling Federation. The World Championship was unified into the WWF Championship and the two belts collectively represented the title named the Undisputed WWF Championship.|$|E

500|$|The {{two main}} {{features}} of England's first innings were Scotton's [...] "stonewalling" [...] and Read's (batting at number ten) [...] "hard and rapid hitting". Scotton's 90 in six hours and Read's 117 in two enabled England {{to reach a}} respectable 346 but they still had to follow on, 205 runs behind. But the time taken by Scotton's innings left Australia with {{not enough time to}} bowl England <b>out</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> the result was a draw.|$|E
500|$|BSU {{started the}} fourth quarter by {{throwing}} two incomplete passes. Tharp then completed two passes for a combined 39yards before Pirates' defender J.J. Milbrook intercepted Tharp's fifth pass of the quarter. Milbrook returned the interception 27yards. The Pirates completed one first down but failed to convert the interception into points. Kicker Matt Dodge came into the game, ostensibly to punt the ball away. In a trick play, he rushed the ball instead, picking up the first down. Despite the trick play's success, the Pirates {{were not able to}} gain another first down. On fourth down, Dodge came <b>out</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> this time punted the ball 47yards for a touchback. [...] The Broncos began the second drive of {{the fourth quarter}} by going 80yards in nine plays for a touchdown. It took just three minutes and 59seconds and BSU only three first downs. Boise had now cut the Pirates' lead to 38–31.|$|E
500|$|After a hiatus, Partridge {{returned}} in 2010 {{in a series}} of YouTube shorts, Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge, as the host of a digital radio show with co-presenter Sidekick Simon (Tim Key). Coogan co-wrote the shorts with brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who submitted scripts to his company Baby Cow Productions; the Gibbons have co-written every Partridge project since. According to Neil, Coogan [...] "invited us in, our sensibilities chimed, and before we knew it, Mid Morning Matters was up and running. We wrote it as if it was our baby, and though {{there was a sense that}} we were standing on the shoulders of giants, I think we were like two pairs of fresh eyes, and Steve seemed to fall in love with the character all over again." [...] Coogan said they chose the web format because [...] "it was a bit underground, a low-key environment in which to test the character <b>out</b> <b>again.</b> <b>And</b> the response was so good, we realised there was more fuel in the tank." [...] The shorts were later broadcast by Sky Atlantic.|$|E

500|$|Levels were {{designed}} {{based on a}} Deluxe Paint interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in [...] "hundreds of levels". There were several internal iterations of the levels, each designer challenging the others. Dailly pointed out that David Jones [...] "used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing a finger at the screen and saying 'There! Beat that!', we'd calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps, and {{doing it in a}} much simpler method. 'Oh...', he'd mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it." [...] They also sent internally tested levels to Psygnosis, getting back the results of their testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that [...] "Every now and again though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed <b>out</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and it gave us all a warm fuzzy feeling inside." ...|$|E

[...] "Bootylicious", [...] "Jumpin' Jumpin'", [...] "Say My Name", [...] "Independent Women Part I", [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] and [...] "Survivor" [...] are performed afterwards as part of the medley. She introduces the next song [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] saying that she wrote it for all the ladies, [...] "I thought it was something we all need to hear. When we get in these relationships they don't work out. Sometimes we blame the man, we blame another girl, we blame ourselves. But I think we should take every experience and learn a lesson out of it, even the bad experiences and I want all the ladies to know that we will never disappoint ourselves. You'll always have yourself." [...] She introduces the next song [...] "Summertime" [...] as one of her favorite songs asking from the crowd to dance further performing a step dance while footage of flowers was projected on the screen. The lights go <b>out</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> Beyoncé appears wearing a grey, sparkly dress for an extended performance of [...] "Dangerously in Love" [...] surrounded by smoke.
