5|$|A {{declared}} {{purpose of}} the Treaty of the Triple Alliance was the demolition of the Humaitá fortifications and that none others of that sort should be built again. However the fortress, though not by then invulnerable to the latest armour-plated warships, was a serious <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allies’ plans to proceed upriver to the Paraguayan capital Asunción and to recapture the Brazilian territory of Mato Grosso: it delayed them {{for two and a}} half years. It was taken in the Siege of Humaitá (1868), then razed pursuant to the Treaty.|$|E
5|$|In 1427, Stefan's {{successor}} Đurađ Branković had {{to return}} Belgrade to the Hungarian king, and Smederevo became the new capital. Although the Ottomans captured most of the Serbian Despotate, Belgrade, known as Nándorfehérvár in Hungarian, was unsuccessfully besieged in 1440 and 1456. As the city presented an <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman advance into Hungary and further, over 100,000 Ottoman soldiers besieged it in 1456, in which the Christian army led by the Hungarian General John Hunyadi successfully defended it. The noon bell ordered by Pope Callixtus III commemorates the victory throughout the Christian world to this day.|$|E

In 1915, he {{was transferred to the}} école primaire supérieure (secondary) at Bingerville in spite of his family's reluctance to have him go to boarding school. The same year, at Bingerville, Houphouët converted to Christianity; he considered it a modern religion and an <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spread of Islam.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Croatian War of Independence, in 19911992, a non-Serb population of more than 220,000 was forcibly removed from Serb-held territories in Croatia, as the RSK was established. In the wake of Operation Storm, a part of those refugees, as well as Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, settled in a substantial number of housing units in the area formerly held by the ARSK, presenting an <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> return of Serb refugees. , out of 300,000350,000 Serbs who fled from Croatia during the entire war, 132,707 are registered as having returned, but only 6065% of those are believed to reside permanently in the country. However, only 20,00025,000 more are interested in returning to Croatia. , approximately 60,000 Serb refugees from Croatia remained in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Operation Summer '95 was {{launched}} {{in response to the}} resumption of attacks by the VRS and the RSK military on the Bihać pocketone of six United Nations Safe Areas established in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The area was viewed as strategic to the Croatian military effort by the HV General Staff because it presented an <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> supply of the RSK and it pinned down a portion of the RSK military, as well as some VRS forces that would otherwise have been redeployed. The international community feared the worst humanitarian disaster of the war to that point would occur if the RSK or the VRS overran the Bihać pocket. The United States, France and the United Kingdom were divided about the best way to protect the pocket.|$|E
5|$|Since 2003, Croatian {{foreign policy}} has focused on {{achieving}} the strategic goal of becoming a member state of the European Union (EU).

Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 marking {{the end of a}} process started in 2001 by signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and Croatian application for the EU membership in 2003. A recurring <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> negotiations was Croatia's ICTY co-operation record and Slovenian blocking of the negotiations because of Croatia–Slovenia border disputes. The latter was resolved through an Arbitration Agreement of 4 November 2009, approved by national parliaments and a referendum in Slovenia.|$|E

5|$|The Frontier Militia {{represents}} the military {{arm of the}} Frontier systems' territorial defense pact. The Militia is a loosely governed mishmash of homesteaders, bandits, mercenaries, and pirates, all rising up as 'citizen soldiers' when the need arises. Each brigade within the Militia is responsible for fighting in an assigned section of Frontier territory. Although some brigades {{are little more than}} vast pirate organizations, the Militia has enough resources to be a real <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> IMC's ambitions on the Frontier. The Militia often claims that direct action against the IMC {{is in the best interest}} of the homesteaders whom they allegedly represent, but not everyone on the Frontier sees it that way.|$|E
5|$|A {{potential}} <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{adoption of}} biological pest control measures is growers {{sticking to the}} familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides {{have a variety of}} undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E
5|$|By March 1945, the Allies had {{advanced}} into Germany and {{had reached the}} River Rhine. The Rhine was a formidable natural <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allied advance, but if breached would allow the Allies to access the North German Plain and ultimately advance on Berlin and other major cities in Northern Germany. Following the 'Broad Front Approach' laid out by General Eisenhower, {{it was decided to}} attempt to breach the Rhine in several areas. British Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, commanding the 21st Army Group, devised a plan to allow the forces under his command to breach the Rhine, which he entitled Operation Plunder, and which was subsequently authorized by Eisenhower. Plunder envisioned the British Second Army, under Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey and the U.S. Ninth Army under Lieutenant General William Simpson crossing the Rhine at Rees, Wesel, and an area south of the Lippe Canal. To ensure that the operation was a success, Montgomery insisted that an airborne component was inserted into the plans for the operation to support the amphibious assaults that would take place, which was code-named Operation Varsity. Three airborne divisions were initially chosen to take part in Varsity, these being the British 6th Airborne Division, the U.S. 13th Airborne Division and the 17th Airborne Division, all of which were assigned to the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps.|$|E

5|$|Matilda {{had been}} educated in a {{sequence}} of convents, however, and may well have taken the vows to formally become a nun, which formed an <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> marriage progressing. She {{did not wish to}} be a nun and appealed to Anselm for permission to marry Henry, and the Archbishop established a council at Lambeth Palace to judge the issue. Despite some dissenting voices, the council concluded that although Matilda had lived in a convent, she had not actually become a nun and was therefore free to marry, a judgement that Anselm then affirmed, allowing the marriage to proceed. Matilda proved an effective queen for Henry, acting as a regent in England on occasion, addressing and presiding over councils, and extensively supporting the arts. The couple soon had two children, Matilda, born in 1102, and William Adelin, born in 1103; it is possible that they also had a second son, Richard, who died young. Following the birth of these children, Matilda preferred to remain based in Westminster while Henry travelled across England and Normandy, either for religious reasons or because she enjoyed being involved in the machinery of royal governance.|$|E
5|$|At the election, Labour lost 91 {{seats in}} the House of Commons, but the Conservatives failed to achieve an overall majority, {{resulting}} in the first hung parliament since 1974. Under the constitution governing {{what happens in the}} event of a hung parliament, Brown remained temporarily as Prime Minister, while the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives entered into talks aimed at forming a coalition government. Talks between the Liberal Democrats and Labour also took place. On 10 May, Brown announced his intention to resign as leader of the Labour Party and instructed the party to initiate the election of a new leader. Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen an <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> negotiation of a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. By 11 May, the possibility of a deal was becoming less likely as talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued. After a telephone conversation with his predecessor Tony Blair where Blair informed Brown that the election had shown that the British voters had lost faith in both him and the Labour Party and that the United Kingdom would not accept him continuing as Prime Minister. With this he concluded that he would not be able to form a government, Brown announced his resignation as Prime Minister. He also resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. Brown was succeeded as Prime Minister by David Cameron, while Harriet Harman became acting leader of the Labour Party.|$|E
5|$|Opinion amongst modern historians is also split; for instance, Fine {{accepts the}} concept of the Peace of Callias, whereas Sealey {{effectively}} rejects it. Holland accepts that some kind of accommodation was made between Athens and Persia, but no actual treaty. Fine argues that Callisthenes's denial that a treaty was made after the Eurymedon does not preclude a peace being made at another point. Further, he suggests that Theopompus was actually referring to a treaty that had allegedly been negotiated with Persia in 423 BC. If these views are correct, it would remove one major <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> acceptance of the treaty's existence. A further argument for the existence of the treaty is the sudden withdrawal of the Athenians from Cyprus in 449 BC, which Fine suggests makes most sense in the light of some kind of peace agreement. On the other hand, if there was indeed some kind of accommodation, Thucydides's failure to mention it is odd. In his digression on the pentekontaetia, his aim is to explain the growth of Athenian power, and such a treaty, {{and the fact that the}} Delian allies were not released from their obligations after it, would have marked a major step in the Athenian ascendancy. Conversely, it has been suggested that certain passages elsewhere in Thucydides's history are best interpreted as referring to a peace agreement. There is thus no clear consensus amongst modern historians as to the treaty's existence.|$|E

5|$|The French gained {{access to}} the {{outermost}} ward by undermining its advanced main tower. Following this, Philip ordered a group of his men {{to look for a}} weak point in the castle. They {{gained access to}} the next ward when a soldier named Ralph found a latrine chute in use through which the French could clamber into the chapel. After ambushing several unsuspecting guards, and setting fire to the buildings, Philip's men then lowered the movable bridge and allowed the rest of their army into the castle. The Anglo-Norman troops retreated to the inner ward. After a short time the French successfully breached the gate of the inner ward, and the garrison retreated finally to the keep. With supplies running low Roger de Lacy and his garrison of 20knights and 120other soldiers surrendered to the French army, bringing the siege to an end on 6March 1204. In drawn-out medieval sieges, contemporary writers often emphasised the importance of dwindling supplies in the capitulation of the garrison, {{as was the case with}} the Siege of Château Gaillard. With the castle under French control, the main <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French entering the Seine valley was removed; they were able to enter the valley unmolested and take Normandy. Thus, for the first time since it had been given as a duchy to Rollo in 911, Normandy was directly ruled by the French king. The city of Rouen surrendered to Philip II on 23June 1204. After that, the rest of Normandy was easily conquered by the French.|$|E
5|$|The Rhine {{river was}} a {{formidable}} natural <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allied advance, but if breached {{would allow the}} Allies access to the North German Plain and ultimately to advance on Berlin and other major cities in Northern Germany.

However, it was discovered that there were only enough transport aircraft available in Europe to transport two airborne divisions into combat, and as such it was removed from Operation Varsity due to its lack of combat experience.|$|E
