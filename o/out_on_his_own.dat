5|$|In critic Gary Giddins' view,Kelly {{was never}} able to exploit his gifts when he went <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> His quartet with Wes Montgomery should have {{developed}} into a major force, but the same commercial interests that shanghaied Montgomery saddled Kelly with the fashionable soul-funk of the mid-'60s. Unlike Montgomery, his career went nowhere, and he didn't live long enough to find himself again.|$|E

In 1904, Tan struck <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> selling pineapples and rice and {{manufacturing}} rubber tyres and shoes. Tan's rubber business flourished and, with growing wealth, he altruistically donated money to many schools and established Amoy University (now Xiamen University). However, Tan's loyalty still lay with his motherland and he ardently supported opponents of the Qing rulers during the Xinhai Revolution. By this time, Tan's philanthropic work and political inclinations had made him a popular figure amongst the Chinese in Singapore and China.|$|E

5|$|By 1966, Reynolds {{had grown}} weary of touring and Stewart wanted to strike <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> as a singer-songwriter, so the three musicians and Werber {{developed}} {{an exit strategy}} of playing as many dates as possible for a year with an endpoint determined to be a final two-week engagement at the Hungry i in June 1967. The group followed this strategy successfully, and on June 17, 1967, the Kingston Trio ceased to be an actively performing band.|$|E

Thomas Rogers had been {{designing}} and building machinery for textile manufacturing for nearly 20 years when he sold his interest in Godwin, Rogers & Company (of which he was the Rogers part of the name) in June of that year.

He convinced Walter Zinn to become his collaborator, and hired Semyon Krewer to investigate processes for manufacturing pure uranium and graphite.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Austrian Empire, Tesla {{received}} an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.|$|E
5|$|Born in Rome in 1783, Pistrucci studied {{briefly with}} other artists before {{striking}} <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> at age 15. He became prominent as a cameo carver and was patronised by royalty. In 1815, {{he moved to}} Britain, where he would live {{for most of the}} rest of his life. His talent brought him to the attention of notables including William Wellesley-Pole, the Master of the Mint. Pole engaged Pistrucci to design new coinage, including the sovereign, which was first issued in 1817 to mixed reactions. Although Pole probably promised Pistrucci the post of Chief Engraver, the position could not be awarded as only a British subject could hold it. This slight became a long-term grievance for Pistrucci.|$|E

2500|$|Schörner is {{commonly}} represented in historical literature as a simple, draconian disciplinarian and a slavish devotee of Hitler's defensive orders.
