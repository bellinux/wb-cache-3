5|$|Early on the {{afternoon}} of Thursday, March1, at 1:08pm CST (19:08 UTC), a destructive tornado first developed near the Enterprise Municipal Airport. The tornado lifted off the ground briefly before returning to the ground as an even stronger storm. It quickly slammed into Enterprise, Alabama, at 1:12pm CST (19:12 UTC). The tornado left severe damage throughout a large section of the city. The most severe damage took place at Enterprise High School, where a section of the school was destroyed during the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>day.</b> Eight students were killed at the school and 50 other people were taken to local hospitals. Some early reports suggested that there had been as many as 15 deaths at Enterprise High School and 18 deaths statewide, which was found to be an over-estimation. It was the first killer tornado at a US school since the Grand Isle, Louisiana tornado in 1993, and the deadliest tornado-related school disaster since one in Belvidere, Illinois in 1967. One other death was reported in Enterprise at a nearby private residence when a woman's living room window was shattered by the tornado.|$|E

However, Springfield Elementary School stays open regardless of the storm, even though every other local school closes. Only some students, including the classmates of Bart and Lisa, show up while Skinner and Willie are the only faculty members at the school that day. To pass the time, Skinner plays his professed favourite film, a very low-budget, long-running, 1938 holiday film called The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was, which Lisa notices has {{very little to do with}} Christmas. By the time the movie is finally over, it is already the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>day,</b> and Skinner lets the kids go home--however, Skinner and the students quickly realize that over the course of the day, the snow has piled up tremendously, leaving them and Groundskeeper Willie trapped inside the school, much to the horror of the kids.|$|E
500|$|In 1914, Jardine entered Winchester College. At the time, life at Winchester was arduous and austere; {{discipline}} was harsh. Sport {{and exercise}} were vital parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>day.</b> In Jardine's time, preparing the pupils for war was also important. According to Jardine's biographer, Christopher Douglas, the pupils were [...] "taught to be honest, impervious to physical pain, uncomplaining and civilised." [...] All pupils {{were required to}} be academically competent and Jardine {{was able to get}} along without exhibiting brilliance; successful sportsmen, on the other hand, were revered. Jardine enjoyed a slightly better position than some pupils, already possessing a reputation as a cricketer and excelling at other sports; he represented the school at football as a goalkeeper and rackets, and played Winchester College football. But it was at cricket that he excelled. He was in the first eleven for three years from 1917 and received coaching from Harry Altham, Rockley Wilson and Schofield Haigh, the latter two of whom were distinguished cricketers. In 1919, his final year, Jardine came top of the school batting averages with 997 runs at an average of 66.46. He also became captain despite some doubts within the school about his ability to unify the team. Under Jardine, Winchester won their annual match against Eton College in 1919, a fixture in which Eton usually held the upper hand. Jardine's batting (35 and 89 in the match) and captaincy were key factors in his side's first victory over Eton for 12 years. After his retirement from cricket, he named his 89 in that match as his favourite innings. Jardine went on to score 135 not out against Harrow School.|$|E

2500|$|Foreign {{language}} immersion {{programs in the}} U.S. are designed for students whose home language is English. In the early immersion model, for all or part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>day</b> elementary school children receive their content (academic) instruction {{through the medium of}} another language: Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, etc. [...] In early total immersion models, children receive all the regular kindergarten and first grade content through the medium of the immersion language; English reading is introduced later, often in the second grade. Most content (math, science, social studies, art, music) continues to be taught through the immersion language. In early partial immersion models, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>day</b> (usually 50%) delivers content through the immersion language, and part delivers it through English. [...] French-{{language immersion}} programs are common in Canada in the provincial school systems, as part of the drive towards bilingualism and are increasing in number in the United States in public school systems (Curtain & Dahlbert, 2004). Branaman & Rhodes (1998) report that between 1987 and 1997 the percentage of elementary programs offering foreign language education in the U.S. through immersion grew from 2% to 8% and Curtain & Dahlberg (2004) report 278 foreign language immersion programs in 29 states. Research by Swain and others (Genesee 1987) demonstrate much higher levels of proficiency achieved by children in foreign language immersion programs than in traditional foreign language education elementary school models.|$|E
