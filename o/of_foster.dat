When Gooch was last man out for 84 on the third day, England had compiled 202. The England bowlers managed to restrain the West Indian batsmen, Childs notably bowling 40 overs for just 79 runs, but, with more than two days left to play, there was little pressure on the West Indies, and they strolled to victory in 91 overs, losing just two wickets, with more than a day to spare.|$|E

5|$|Many traditions have {{stressed}} the grief of mothers over deprivation {{of their children}} but little has been said historically about young children's loss of their mothers; {{this may have been}} because loss of the mother in infancy frequently meant death for a breast-fed infant. In the 19th century, French society bureaucratised a system in which infants were breast-fed at the homes <b>of</b> <b>foster</b> mothers, returning to the biological family after weaning, and no concern was evinced at the possible effect of this double separation on the child.|$|E
5|$|The film had a {{difficult}} and occasionally troubling pre-production history. When the novel was published in 1999, The Silence of the Lambs director Jonathan Demme, screenwriter Ted Tally, and actress Jodie Foster all declined {{to be involved in}} its adaptation. Ridley Scott became attached as director after the success of Gladiator (2000), and eventually signed onto the project after reading the script pitched by Dino De Laurentiis, who produced Manhunter (1986), based on the 1981 Harris novel Red Dragon. After the departure <b>of</b> <b>Foster</b> and screenwriter Tally, Julianne Moore took on Foster's role while David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote the screenplay.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a study {{examining}} the direct and indirect costs to volunteer carers <b>of</b> providing a <b>fostering</b> service in Australia. The study highlights the current difficulties in carer recruitment and retention, the increases in the challenging and complex needs of the children coming into care, and the growing professionalism <b>of</b> <b>fostering.</b> The study uses a budgetary approach to estimate the direct costs <b>of</b> <b>fostered</b> children. In-depth interviews and focus groups with carers are instrumental in providing a range of perspectives that assist {{our understanding of how}} the direct costs <b>of</b> <b>fostered</b> children are different from (higher than) the costs of other children. The study found the costs <b>of</b> <b>fostered</b> children were 40 per cent higher than the costs of children not in care. The thesis indicates that, to maintain and retain a volunteer workforce, an adequate carer remuneration system to meet the direct costs <b>of</b> <b>fostered</b> children is critical. To examine the indirect costs <b>of</b> <b>fostering,</b> the study uses a multi-method approach providing a monetary value of the opportunity costs (foregone earnings model) and time costs (proxy good or market replacement model) for foster carers. The emotional and psychological dimensions <b>of</b> <b>fostering</b> are also examined, though no monetary value is assigned to these costs. Carers&# 146; vivid and contrasting stories from the interviews explain how &# 145;money&# 146; fits with carer motivation and fostering&# 146;s more professional role, how carers perceive the nature <b>of</b> <b>fostering</b> (job or parenting), and whether carers should be paid to <b>foster.</b> Revelations <b>of</b> fostering&# 146;s emotional and time dimensions and restricted employment opportunities (indirect costs) highlight the impact fostering has on carers and their families. The study found that the indirect costs <b>of</b> <b>fostered</b> children were around four times the value of the direct costs. In light of the growing professionalism <b>of</b> contemporary <b>foster</b> care, difficulties in carer recruitment/retention, and the demanding nature <b>of</b> <b>fostering,</b> the thesis examines whether carers should be paid for the service they provide (compensation for indirect costs). Using a number of theoretical concepts developed by feminist economists and social theorists on paying for caring labour, the thesis found support for the contention that altruism (&# 145;love&# 146;) and carer pay (&# 145;money&# 146;) are not incompatible, and ambiguities and tensions for foster mothers around money and love can be resolved. Studies of countries where carers receive a wage component as part of their remuneration package provide insights into wage levels, perceived adequacy of the wage, and the impact of wages on carer recruitment/retention. The study found that, due to the profoundly gendered nature <b>of</b> <b>fostering,</b> the compensatory aspects of remuneration (fee/wage or salary) are generally poor. The implications for government welfare spending of paying Australian carers are discussed, and the savings to governments of using a volunteer workforce are demonstrated...|$|R

5|$|Frank Jonathan Morgan is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera Home and Away, played by Alex Papps.

Frank is one of the five foster children of Pippa (Vanessa Downing) and Tom Fletcher (Roger Oakley) who move to Summer Bay to begin a new life. The serial's creator Alan Bateman thought of the idea while observing the locals of a rural town in New South Wales opposing the idea <b>of</b> <b>foster</b> children living in the area. Papps was cast into the role and immediately began receiving fan mail. Frank has been played by actors Bradley Pilato and Michael Scilusa during flashback sequences.|$|E
5|$|The freeway ends, and SR67 turns {{north and}} becomes an {{undivided}} highway at Mapleview Street, crossing the San Diego River and entering the locale of Moreno. SR67 then enters the rural area east of Sycamore Canyon County Open Space Preserve near the locale <b>of</b> <b>Foster,</b> passing {{to the west}} of San Vicente Reservoir. The road intersects the eastern end of Scripps Poway Parkway and County Route S4 (CRS4), the latter within the Poway city limits. In eastern Poway, SR67 veers east, eventually leaving the city and entering unincorporated Rock Haven. The road continues near Rosemont, California before turning northeast and becoming Julian Road and then Main Street in downtown Ramona. SR67 ends at the intersection with SR78; SR78 intersects to the northwest as Pine Street and continues northeast along Main Street towards Julian.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from service, Al reunited with Lucille, but {{his inability to}} find steady work left the family impoverished. They both struggled with alcohol, and often fought when intoxicated. The violence sometimes drove Hendrix to withdraw and hide in a closet in their home. His relationship with his brother Leon (born 1948) was close but precarious; with Leon in and out <b>of</b> <b>foster</b> care, they lived with an almost constant threat of fraternal separation. In addition to Leon, Hendrix had three younger siblings: Joseph, born in 1949, Kathy in 1950, and Pamela, 1951, all of whom Al and Lucille gave up to foster care and adoption. The family frequently moved, staying in cheap hotels and apartments around Seattle. On occasion, family members would take Hendrix to Vancouver to stay at his grandmother's. A shy and sensitive boy, he was deeply affected by his life experiences. In later years, he confided to a girlfriend {{that he had been}} the victim of sexual abuse by a man in uniform. On December 17, 1951, when Hendrix was nine years old, his parents divorced; the court granted Al custody of him and Leon.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with MN28 {{on the eastern}} edge of Beardsley and heads south. From here, MN7 passes through farm fields before turning southeasterly along the shore of Big Stone Lake. The lake {{is the source of the}} Minnesota River and forms the Minnesotaâ€“South Dakota state line in Big Stone County. The highway in this area is also a part of the Minnesota River Valley Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway and a Minnesota State Scenic Byway. The road turns eastward along a bend in the lake near the community <b>of</b> <b>Foster</b> before running further inland around Big Stone Lake State Park. Past the park, MN7 curves to the south along the shore and continues to Ortonville. The highway follows 2nd Street through town along the lake shore and through residential neighborhoods. South of the end of the lake, MN7 merges with US12, and the two highways run concurrently for about a couple blocks. South of town, MN7 merges onto US75 and the combined highway runs along the Minnesota River. The roadway also runs parallel to a line of the BNSF Railway used by the Twin Cities and Western Railroad in the area. East of the Big Stone National Wildlife Refuge and the town of Odessa, US75 and the scenic byway turn south to cross the river, separating from MN7 which continues along the northern banks of the river.|$|E
