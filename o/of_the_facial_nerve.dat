25|$|The {{facial nerve}} {{controls}} {{a number of}} functions, such as blinking and closing the eyes, smiling, frowning, lacrimation, salivation, flaring nostrils and raising eyebrows. It also carries taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, via the chorda tympani nerve (a branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve).</b> Because of this, people with Bell's palsy may present with loss of taste sensation in the anterior 2/3 of the tongue on the affected side.|$|E
25|$|Bell's palsy is {{the most}} common cause of one sided facial nerve {{paralysis}} (70%). It occurs in 1 to 4 per 10,000 people per year. About 1.5% of people are affected at some point in their life. It most commonly occurs in people between ages 15 and 60. Males and females are affected equally. It is named after Scottish surgeon Charles Bell (1774–1842), who first described the connection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> to the condition.|$|E
25|$|Around 9% of {{patients}} {{have some sort}} of sequelae after Bell's palsy, typically the synkinesis already discussed, or spasm, contracture, tinnitus and/or hearing loss during facial movement or crocodile tear syndrome. This is also called gustatolacrimal reflex or Bogorad's Syndrome and involves the sufferer shedding tears while eating.

30|$|Malignant {{external}} otitis, {{though not}} a malignant tumor, is very invasive and difficult to resolve.

25|$|Since synkinesis {{has been}} {{reported}} in patients within 1–2 months, the nuclear hyper-excitability hypothesis is being supported by more researchers. Furthermore, axonal regeneration is a slow process (~1mm/day growth) and regeneration at this rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> would roughly take 4–8 months. Since synkinesis is observed much earlier, aberrant regeneration and ephaptic communication fail to explain for this observation thus providing evidence that nuclear hyper-excitability {{is an important factor in}} the mechanism of synkinesis development.|$|E
25|$|One {{disease that}} may be {{difficult}} to exclude in the differential diagnosis is involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> in infections with the herpes zoster virus.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Delayed cranial {{neuropathy}} is {{an uncommon}} complication of neurosurgical interventions <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> exact etiology is uncertain. Several authors have hypothesized that reactivation of herpesviruses {{may play a}} role. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: The first patient underwent microvascular decompression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> because <b>of</b> hemifacial spasm. Nine days postoperatively, he developed severe <b>facial</b> weakness on <b>the</b> ipsilateral side. The polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus (HSV) was positive in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Treatment with intravenous acyclovir was initiated, after which a rapid and marked improvement was observed. The second patient developed left-sided facial numbness 20 days after microvascular decompression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left <b>facial</b> <b>nerve.</b> <b>The</b> polymerase chain reaction for HSV was positive in the CSF. Treatment with intravenous acyclovir resulted in full recovery. The third patient underwent a suboccipital craniectomy with excision of a meningioma located at the left petrosal apex. Three months postoperatively, she developed multiple cranial neuropathies (involving cranial nerves V, VI, VIII, and XII). This was accompanied by serologic evidence of HSV reactivation and a positive polymerase chain reaction for HSV in the CSF. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous acyclovir. CONCLUSIONS: The 3 reported cases provide evidence that delayed postoperative cranial neuropathy {{can be caused by}} HSV reactivation and can involve multiple cranial nerves. An increased awareness of this treatable postoperative complication is warranted...|$|R
30|$|In {{spite of}} {{disagreement}} among some clinicians regarding <b>the</b> exact limits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ITF and/or recommended surgical approaches, we {{have described the}} modified ZTMA here because of its versatility.

Although <b>the</b> safe resection <b>of</b> tympanic bone or <b>the</b> safe control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infratemporal <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> (or jugular bulb) are not feasible, most ITF tumors in the oral and maxillofacial region can be removed by this conventional approach.|$|R
25|$|It {{is thought}} {{that as a result}} of {{inflammation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve,</b> pressure is produced on the nerve where it exits the skull within its bony canal (the stylomastoid foramen), blocking the transmission of neural signals or damaging the nerve. Patients with facial palsy for which an underlying cause can be found are not considered to have Bell's palsy per se. Possible causes include tumor, meningitis, stroke, diabetes mellitus, head trauma and inflammatory diseases of the cranial nerves (sarcoidosis, brucellosis, etc.). In these conditions, the neurologic findings are rarely restricted to the facial nerve. Babies can be born with facial palsy. In a few cases, bilateral facial palsy has been associated with acute HIV infection.|$|E
25|$|Abnormalities of the {{cranial nerves}} are present 50-70% of cases. The most common {{abnormality}} is involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve,</b> which {{may lead to}} reduced power on one or {{both sides of the}} face (65% resp 35% of all cranial nerve cases), followed by reduction in visual perception due to optic nerve involvement. Rarer symptoms are double vision (oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve or abducens nerve), decreased sensation of the face (trigeminal nerve), hearing loss or vertigo (vestibulocochlear nerve), swallowing problems (glossopharyngeal nerve) and weakness of the shoulder muscles (accessory nerve) or the tongue (hypoglossal nerve). Visual problems may also be the result of papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) due to obstruction by granulomas of the normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the causes}} for dysgeusia occur due to unknown reasons. A wide range of {{miscellaneous}} factors may contribute to this taste disorder, such as gastric reflux, lead poisoning, and diabetes mellitus. A minority of pine nuts can apparently cause taste disturbances, for reasons which are not entirely proven. Certain pesticides can have damaging effects on the taste buds and nerves in the mouth. These pesticides include organochloride compounds and carbamate pesticides. Damage to the peripheral nerves, along with injury to the chorda tympani branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve,</b> also cause dysgeusia. A surgical risk for laryngoscopy and tonsillectomy include dysgeusia. Patients who suffer from the burning mouth syndrome, most likely menopausal women, are often suffering from dysgeusia as well.|$|E

40|$|CHARGE {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} mutations in the CHD 7 gene. Several organ systems including the retina, cranial nerves, inner ear and heart are affected in CHARGE syndrome. However, the mechanistic link between mutations in CHD 7 and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organ systems dysfunction remains elusive. Here, we show that Chd 7 is required for <b>the</b> organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neural retina in zebrafish. We observe an abnormal expression or a complete absence of molecular markers for the retinal ganglion cells and photoreceptors, indicating that Chd 7 regulates <b>the</b> differentiation <b>of</b> retinal cells and plays {{an essential role in}} retinal cell development. In addition, zebrafish with reduced Chd 7 display an abnormal organization and clustering of cranial motor neurons. We also note a pronounced reduction in <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> branchiomotor neurons and the vagal motor neurons display aberrant positioning. Further, these fish exhibit a severe loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerves.</b> Knock-down <b>of</b> Chd 7 results in a curvature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long body axis and these fish develop irregular shaped vertebrae and have a reduction in bone mineralization. Chd 7 knockdown also results in a loss of proper segment polarity illustrated by flawed efnb 2 a and ttna expression, which is associated with later vascular segmentation defects.

25|$|Cephalic tetanus is {{the rarest}} {{form of the}} disease (0.9–3% of cases) and is limited to muscles and nerves in the head.

Paralysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> is most frequently implicated, which may cause lockjaw, facial palsy, or ptosis, but other cranial nerves can also be affected. Cephalic tetanus may progress to a more generalized form of the disease. Due to its rarity, clinicians may be unfamiliar with the clinical presentation and may not suspect tetanus as the illness. Treatment can be complicated as symptoms may be concurrent with the initial injury that caused the infection. Cephalic tetanus is more likely than other forms of tetanus to be fatal, with the progression to generalized tetanus carrying a 15–30% case fatality rate.|$|E
