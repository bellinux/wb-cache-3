This study sought to investigate the impact of competition {{on the performance of}} the mobile telecommunication industry in Kenya. This research aimed at looking at how competition has impacted on performance of the four firms in the sector i. e. Orange Kenya, Airtel, Yu and Safaricom (K) ltd. The study used a descriptive research design that answered questions how competition affects the independent variables of the study i. e. new market entrants, competitive rivalry and buyer power. Simple stratified sampling was used to select the sample of the respondents to avoid bias and ensure that samples drawn were representative of the population of mobile service subscribers of the four firms. Data collection was done using questionnaires and analyzed using Ms Excel. The results were presented using bar graphs and pie charts. The study found out that competition has an impact on the performance of firms and this accounted for 79. 8 % while 20. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> competition did not have an impact on performance of firms. From the research it was further established that majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> new market entrants, competitive rivalry and buyer power affects performance of the firms in this industry accounting for 61. 2 % while 38. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> new market entrants, competitive rivalry and buyer power did not affect the performance of the firms in the telecommunication industry in Kenya.

Quantitative methods were used to examine <b>the</b> concerns <b>of</b> 88 police officers and first-line supervisors regarding civil litigation and the impact these concerns have on <b>the</b> discharge <b>of</b> their duties. <b>The</b> results indicate that the police officers in the study were not significantly concerned with <b>the</b> deterrent effects <b>of</b> lawsuits on their arrest activity, but there was a difference between <b>the</b> opinions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> police officers and their superiors regarding civil liability. A significant finding was that almost half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>indicated</b> they possessed a bachelor’s degree, but over one third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>indicated</b> they had never received any formal training in civil liability. The study recommends strengthening the training curriculum in civil liability for all police academy attendees and through proper policy development and effective training programs through in-service activities for veteran police officers. In addition, employing risk managers in police agencies would allow for a systematic review of liability issues facing the agencies and the ability to mitigate those issues.
