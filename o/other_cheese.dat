5000|$|Most [...] "young" [...] Edam cheese sold {{in stores}} {{has a very}} mild flavor, {{slightly}} salty or nutty, and almost no smell when compared to <b>other</b> <b>cheeses.</b> As the cheese ages, its flavor sharpens, and it becomes firmer. It has a significantly lower fat content than many other traditional cheeses; Edam may have as little as 28% fat in dry matter. Modern Edam is softer than <b>other</b> <b>cheeses,</b> such as Cheddar, due to its low fat content.

50|$|Although {{rationing}} formally {{ended in}} 1954, cheese production remained depressed for decades afterwards. During rationing, most milk in Britain {{was used to}} make one kind of cheese, nicknamed Government Cheddar (not {{to be confused with}} the government cheese issued by the US welfare system). This wiped out nearly all <b>other</b> <b>cheese</b> production in the country, and some indigenous varieties of cheese almost disappeared. Later government controls on milk prices through the Milk Marketing Board continued to discourage production of other varieties of cheese until well into the 1980s, and it was only in the mid-1990s (following the effective abolition of the MMB) that the revival of the British cheese industry began in earnest.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to investigate possibility of using multivariate statistical process control in analysing cheese quality parameters. Two cheese types (white brined cheeses and soft cheese from ultra-filtered milk) were selected and analysed for several quality parameters such as dry matter, milk fat, protein contents, pH, NaCl, fat in dry matter and moisture in non-fat solids. The obtained results showed significant variations for most of the quality characteristics which were examined among the two types of cheese. The only stable parameter in both types of cheese was moisture in non-fat solids. All of the <b>other</b> <b>cheese</b> quality characteristics were characterized above or below control limits for most of the samples. Such results indicated a high instability and variations within cheese production. Although the use of statistical process control is not mandatory in the dairy industry, it might provide benefits to organizations in improving quality control of dairy products. ...|$|E
