5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light {{travels to the}} distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> out than it is <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and {{the distance to the}} distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E
