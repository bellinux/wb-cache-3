5|$|Bokhary's first {{brush with}} the police {{was in the early}} hours of 24 June 2001, when the manager <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> in Central {{district}} of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance. When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary, she hit one officer on the cheek; it took four officers at the scene to put her in handcuffs. Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E
5|$|Calculus' shark-shaped {{submarine}} was visually {{based on}} a real American submarine; Hergé had seen a picture of this in a German newspaper. The diving suit worn in the story was also based on clippings that Hergé had accumulated. Similarly, the dockside bar depicted by the cartoonist was {{based on a}}n illustration that he had collected. The shop where Haddock and Tintin buy the diving equipment, including the suit, was inspired from a picture <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> which was featured in the German magazine, Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung. The tribal effigy found on a Caribbean island by Sir Francis Haddock was based on a Bamileke tribal statue from Cameroon that Hergé saw in a museum. The Sirius, which had appeared before in The Shooting Star, was named after the SS Sirius, the first ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean solely under steam power, but was visually based upon the design of a trawler, the John-O.88. Hergé had sketched this ship in Ostend docks before obtaining both detailed plans of the trawler from the builders, Jos Boel & Son, and a small-scale model of it from a collector. The undersea wreck of the Unicorn was loosely inspired by images of the wreck of a 17th-century Swedish vessel, the Vasa, which Hergé had collected. The instance in the story in which a shark swallows a large box (that the characters hope contains the treasure) is based on a real account of a shark that swallowed a camera from the American underwater photographer Otis Barton, which Hergé had encountered in a French illustrated magazine.|$|E

5|$|Dallas {{became one}} of the best-known pilots of Sopwith Triplanes in the RNAS. He opened 1917 by setting an {{altitude}} record of 26,000feet in the Triplane while testing a prototype oxygen set; he endured frostbite and oxygen intoxication in the process. By now No.1 Wing's fighter squadron had been renumbered as No.1 Squadron RNAS, and had totally re-equipped with production Triplanes. It also shifted airfields from Veurne in Belgium to Chipilly in France, leaving behind RNAS control by transferring to No.14 Wing, 4thBrigade of the RFC. Formation flying became the order of the day, as the practice of fighter pilots soloing into combat dwindled. The last three weeks of March were also filled with Dallas's responsibilities for flight and gunnery testing. As British losses in the air began to mount during Bloody April, Dallas and his squadron moved airfields once again, to La Bellevue. They were thus positioned to take a prominent part in the subsequent Battle of Arras, where the intense aerial fighting saw Dallas add to his burgeoning score. The combat of 23April became {{known as one of the}} classic air battles of the war. Dallas and his wingman Thomas Culling took on a squadron-sized formation of 14German aircraft, having gained an altitude edge over their foes. The naval aces exploited this edge by making quick diving attacks from opposite sides, culminating in short bursts of machine-gun fire. Using the Triplane's superior climbing ability, they would then bob back up to position themselves for the next assault. In contrast to the usual hit-and-run tactics of most dogfights, the RNAS duo launched at least 20gunnery runs over 45minutes. The Germans were forced progressively lower, into disarray, and then chased back over their own lines. While they shot down three of the Germans, Dallas and Culling also achieved a more important outcome by blocking and then breaking up a determined enemy effort against the British ground offensive. The action led to the award <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bar</b> to the Distinguished Service Cross for Dallas, and a Distinguished Service Cross for Culling, which were gazetted on 29June.|$|E

40|$|Obesity is a {{significant}} health care problem, affecting more than {{one third of the}} United States population and is an important risk factor for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T 2 D). Adipose tissue expansion results in the recruitment and accumulation of macrophages, which secrete proinflammatory cytokines that impair insulin signaling. Adenosine regulates inflammation by signaling through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the A 2 b adenosine receptor (<b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR).</b> Recently <b>a</b> role for adenosine receptors has been described in the differentiation of osteoblasts and adipocytes. This thesis tests the hypothesis that the <b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR</b> regulates adipose tissue dynamics at the level of preadipocyte differentiation and macrophage inflammation. This thesis showed that activation <b>of</b> the <b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR</b> inhibited preadipocyte differentiation. A 2 bAR-induced adipocyte inhibition was dependent on the expression of Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF 4), which is important for stem cell maintenance and renewal. <b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR</b> knockdown enhanced adipogenesis in vitro and <b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR</b> knockout (KO) mice had more adipocytes as compared to wild type (WT) mice, suggesting enhanced adipogenesis in the absence <b>of</b> the <b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR.</b> The translational potential of this work is strengthened by the previous finding <b>of</b> elevated <b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR</b> expression in adipose tissue of obese individuals as well as our new finding <b>of</b> <b>a</b> close correlation between the expression <b>of</b> <b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR</b> and KLF 4 in adipose tissue <b>of</b> obese individuals. <b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR</b> KO mice have impaired insulin resistance, in part due to reduced levels of insulin receptor substrate- 2 (IRS- 2). Proinflammatory cytokines have been shown to reduce IRS- 2 levels. Given the role <b>of</b> the <b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR</b> in regulating inflammation, the contribution <b>of</b> <b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR</b> signaling in macrophages to insulin resistance was elucidated. Transgenic mice that express <b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR</b> only in macrophages were generated. Intriguingly, restoration <b>of</b> <b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR</b> signaling in macrophages ameliorated insulin resistance, glucose tolerance, and fat and liver tissue insulin signaling. As expected, tissue and plasma proinflammatory cytokine levels were reduced to that of WT mice. This suggested that the protective effect <b>of</b> <b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR</b> signaling on insulin resistance was {{due in large part to}} <b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR</b> control <b>of</b> macrophage cytokine expression. This thesis highlights the importance <b>of</b> <b>A</b> 2 <b>bAR</b> signaling in adipogenesis and in regulating inflammation in the setting of obesity and T 2 D...|$|R
