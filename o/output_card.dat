40|$|Real-time {{control is}} an {{approach}} to evaluate process system with real-time parameters by controlling selected variables to accomplish the control objectives. Real-time issues such as rapid testing, nonlinearity and computational problem have led researchers {{in recent years to}} do intensive work on development methodologies to enhance control in real-time. Selection of control approaches has also been reviewed to adapt with these real-time issues apart from other strategies. In this research, a predictive algorithm namely Generalized Predictive Control will be evaluated in real-time by applying LabVIEW software as tools for algorithm implementation. LabVIEW is chosen because of its block diagram implementation with simple graphical user interface approach to execute algorithm in real-time faster. Hence, it is essential for complex algorithm to control real-time process system. Coupled-tanks have been identified as process models that are inherently nonlinear and hard to control due to unavailability of the exact modelsâ€™ descriptions. As for this, real time control will be applied to the coupled tank as the test bed for level control process. Experimental evaluation and comparison of the predictive algorithm performance will be benchmarked against PID control.

40|$|The goal of {{our senior}} design {{project was to}} design and {{implement}} an autonomous control system for an indoor blimp. The Coast Guard Academy Electrical and Computer Engineering section is sponsoring this effort to develop a model Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to study {{the development and implementation}} of this technology. The information gained from this study will be used to further knowledge of UAV applications in the Coast Guard. The 2005 fall semester was dedicated to developing three critical blimp systems- wireless communication, movement sensing, and manual computer control. In order to begin designing our digital controller in the spring semester, the group completed these three critical blimp systems during the fall semester. We set up an analog <b>output</b> <b>card</b> to send voltages from our computer into the blimp’s remote controller circuit board, allowing users to control the blimp’s movement via a computer. In order to design a digital controller we needed to measure the blimp’s movement. Movement was measured using a µNav ® MNAV 100 CA digital sensor package which detects acceleration in the x, y, and z directions, as well as angular acceleration. All communication with the blimp was made wireless using two frequency modulated transceivers and a Bluetooth wireless transmission device. Transmitters were secured inside the blimp’s gondola, and receivers attached to the computer. The group wanted to wirelessly send the blimp’s acceleration in the x, y, and z directions as well as roll, pitch, and yaw from the sensor package to a computer interface. This was accomplished by implementing the sensor package in conjunction with two transceivers During the spring semester, we examined new methods to receive positioning and movement information from the blimp to supplement the sensor data.

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical Engineering) This thesis {{primarily}} {{addresses the}} subject of analysis and compensation of fictitious power instantaneously: Fictitious power is defined as that component of apparent power which does {{not contribute to the}} nett transfer of energy from source to load. The dynamic characteristics of contemporary electric loads are of such orders of magnitude that the load current contains severe changes 'within a fundamental frequency cycle. Furthermore, such changes might not be periodic but may only appear for short durations. Likewise, load current unbalance may also reach intolerable levels, only for relatively short durations of time. Power theories based on the classic active current approach has the characteristic that calculated magnitudes are only available after some time has elapsed, which usually is a fundamental frequency period. The original instantaneous power theory calculates active and fictitious current magnitudes instantaneously, but these obtained values do not relate to the classic values. Classic static VAr compensator dynamic operation limits lie at switching twice per fundamental frequency cycle, with the result that intra-eycle changes in the load current cannot be compensated. Distortion compensators' comprise an energy storage element and a high frequency converter with dynamic characteristics to compensate instantaneously for fictitious power components. The revised instantaneous power theory is proposed in this thesis and is a combination of the classic active current theory and the original instantaneous power theory. The revised instantaneous power theory generates the fictitious currents instantanenously. A distortion compensator is combined in parallel with the classic static VAr compensator to obtain the hybrid fictitious power compensator. This compensator has dynamic characteristics to match the revised instantaneous power theory and to compensate for high dynamic load current variations within one fundamental cycle. The revised instantaneous power theory is implemented as primary control of a hybrid fictitious power compensator. The error modulation automatic control technique for the distortion compensator is proposed and implemented with improved results in distortion current compensation and current-fed distortion compensator stability. The secondary control of the hybrid fictitious power compensator concerns the feedback of the generated hybrid fictitious power compensator currents. The control of the hybrid fictitious power compensator is done with a personal computer in parallel with analog circuitry. The computer has an on-board dedicated data acquisition and <b>output</b> <b>card.</b> The hybrid fictitious power compensator is demonstrated on two experimental loads and the revised instantaneous power theory is demonstrated on three experimental loads...|$|E
