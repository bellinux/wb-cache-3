According to the lake currents and the Chl a concentrations on the boundary line between the Meiliang Bay and the open water, the transported Chl a was less than 2 % of the total weight of Chl a in Meiliang Bay on August 22, 24 and 25. The {{results suggest that the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>distribution</b> of the bloom-forming Microcystis was strongly affected by the wind conditions, and the wind-driven Microcystis accumulation was mainly determined by surface drift; the transport of Microcystis by lake currents was much less important in this large, shallow lake...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Whereas subriemannian {{geometry}} usually {{deals with}} smooth <b>horizontal</b> <b>distributions,</b> partially hyperbolic dynamical systems provide {{many examples of}} subriemannian geometries defined by non-smooth (namely, Hölder continuous) distributions. These distributions are of great significance for {{the behavior of the}} parent dynamical system. The study of Hölder subriemannian geometries could therefore offer new insights into both dynamics and subriemannian geometry. In this paper we make a small step in that direction: we prove a Hölder-type lower bound on the subriemannian distance for Hölder continuous codimension one <b>horizontal</b> <b>distributions.</b> This bound generalizes the well-known square root bound valid in the smooth case. 1...|$|R

Vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>distributions</b> were determined {{in relation to}} temperature, zooplankton, and light {{during the summer of}} 1963. Food habits of the fingerlings were also examined. A mid-water townet was employed for sampling the fish. Vertical series of temperatures and plankton samples were taken in conjunction with each fishing effort. Diaptomus was taken selectively by the kokanee. Daphnia was taken in proportion to relative abundance. Cyclops was taken least in relation to relative abundance. The fingerlings showed a disproportionate <b>horizontal</b> <b>distribution</b> with the greatest density being at the west end of the lake.

Currents resulting from wind action might have influenced the <b>horizontal</b> <b>distribution.</b> The vertical distribution of kokanee became more restricted as the summer progressed. When surface temperatures rose, the kokanee began to associate with the thermocline at about 60 feet. The mean of the temperatures found at the modes of vertical distribution was 11. 1 C. A multiple regression analysis indicates there was a positive correlation with Diaptomus and with time, and a negative correlation with the product of temperature and time.

The proof relies on a connection between the geodesic equations and the harmonic oscillator equation, and its explicit solution by the Jacobi elliptic functions.
