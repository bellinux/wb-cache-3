5|$|The street started {{being used}} for {{commercial}} purposes {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century and houses were converted for this use. Ground floors became used as shops, while upper floors and back rooms were used as workshops, particularly for metalwork. Augustus Siebe, the pioneer of the diving helmet, lived and worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> today there is an English Heritage blue plaque commemorating him on the house where he lived.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other shopping centres such as Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross shopping centre, Oxford Street remains in high demand as a retail location, with several chains hosting their flagship stores <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> {{has a number of}} listed buildings. The annual switching on of Christmas lights by a celebrity has been a popular event since 1959. However, the combination of a very popular retail area and a main thoroughfare for London buses and taxis has caused significant problems with traffic congestion, safety and pollution. Various traffic management schemes have been proposed by Transport for London, including a ban on private vehicles during daytime hours on weekdays and Saturdays, and improved pedestrian crossings.|$|E

5|$|In 1856, Cleburne and Hindman {{were both}} wounded by gunshots during a street fight in Helena {{with members of}} the Know-Nothing Party {{following}} a debate. Cleburne was shot in the back, turned around and shot one of his attackers, killing him. The attackers hid until Cleburne collapsed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> then left. After the two recovered, they appeared before a grand jury to respond to all charges brought against them. They were exonerated and, afterward, went to Hindman's parents' house in Mississippi. By 1860, he was a naturalized citizen, a practicing lawyer, and very popular with the local residents.|$|E
5|$|Larter {{said she}} was a tomboy until she turned 13. Suddenly she sprouted six inches, gained weight and {{significant}} curves. The next year she was signed by the Ford modeling agency. Larter began her modeling career at the age of 14 when a modeling scout discovered her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> was asked to star in a Phillies commercial; this led to a modeling contract with the prestigious Ford Modeling Agency in New York. Larter subsequently skipped her senior year to model in Australia, Italy, and Japan, the latter a country she would temporarily settle in at the age of seventeen.|$|E
5|$|Not all slaves had {{the same}} social status. Some slaves of wealthy {{families}} lived better than commoners since {{they were allowed to}} wear luxurious clothes and consume quality food and wine. Slaves of high officials could even be feared and respected. The slaves of regent Huo Guang (d. 68 BCE) sometimes came armed to the marketplace and fought commoners, forced the Imperial Secretary to kowtow and apologize (after a scuffle with his slaves over the right-of-way <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street),</b> <b>and</b> were provided services by some officials who sought a promotion through Huo Guang's influence.|$|E

5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Andy Morahan and Eric Watson, and consists of shots of the duo around London. At {{the beginning of the}} video, noises from the city can be heard, a camera passes Lowe <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> focuses on two vintage dolls in a shop window. Then appears a sequence of quick cuts with shots of the city's different sub-cultures; the video freezes and cuts to Tennant and Lowe, who walk through an empty Wentworth Street in Petticoat Lane Market. They stand in front of a red garage door; Tennant is in front dressed with a long coat, white shirt and dark necktie, directly addressing the camera, with Lowe standing behind him with a blank expression. Lowe is filmed in double-exposure and appears almost ghostlike. In other shots, Tennant walks imperiously while Lowe follows behind.|$|E

5|$|Upon the alphabet's acceptance, {{its first}} user was its {{principal}} architect, George D. Watt, who began writing the meeting {{minutes of the}} early Bishops in a cursive form of it in 1854. Almost immediately after its publication, church members began experimenting with it, and by 1855 travel writers Jules Remy and Julius Brenchley published a chart of the new alphabet which differed heavily from the 1854 version. Some early Mormons, such as Thales Hastings Haskell, began writing their personal journals in the new alphabet. Remy further reported that during his time in Salt Lake City, he saw signs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> above shops using the new alphabet.|$|E
5|$|After {{three weeks}} Brian decides {{to meet again}} with Arielle. She gives him a hotel key and in the evening at the hotel room they consummate their relationship. They begin to meet {{regularly}} at the same hotel room in the evenings. Valéry, who is aware of Brian's affair with Arielle, approaches him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>and</b> invites Brian to his house for dinner. At dinner, Brian meets Arielle and Valéry's children and is introduced to Valéry's lover, a 25-year-old editor named Jane (Olivia Thirlby). Arielle later meets Brian's parents, Sam (Frank Langella) and Arlene (Glenn Close). Upon learning that Arielle is a married mother of two, Sam tells Brian that he disapproves of the relationship, while Arlene accepts that they love each other despite the circumstances. When Brian is invited to a New Yorker ceremony to receive an award {{for one of his}} short stories, he is joined by Arielle, Valéry, Jane, and his parents. Jane tells Brian that her boss Galassi (Eric Stoltz), a publisher, has read his story and wants Brian to write a novel.|$|E
5|$|Oxford Street changed {{character}} from residential to retail {{towards the end}} of the 19th century. Drapers, cobblers and furniture stores began to appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> were later expanded into the first department stores. Street vendors began to sell tourist souvenirs on the street during this time. A plan of Oxford Street in Tallis's London Street Views, published in the late 1830s, remarks that almost all the street, save for the far western end, was primarily retail. John Lewis started in 1864 as a small shop at No.132, while Selfridges opened on 15 March 1909 at No.400. Most of the southern side of Oxford Street west of Davies Street was completely rebuilt between 1865 and 1890, allowing a more uniform freehold ownership. By the 1930s, the street was almost entirely retail, a position that remains today. However, unlike nearby streets such as Bond Street and Park Lane, there remained a seedy element including street traders and prostitutes. Aside from a number of fixed places on the street, there are no provisions for selling licensed goods on Oxford Street. The advent of closed-circuit television has reduced the attraction of the area to scam artists and illegal street traders.|$|E

25|$|In the 1880s, {{the first}} horse-drawn buses began {{connecting}} Queen Street with {{areas such as}} Ponsonby Road and Remuera.

25|$|Until the 1640s, {{the width}} of the street varied from 10 to 20 ells (5.9-11.9 metres), but as the {{northern}} settlements were incorporated with the city in 1635, so was Helgeandsholmen, and the standard street width was regulated. Over-Governor Klas Fleming (1592–1644) had Norrbro straightened out, in line with his own site <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>and</b> the width set to 24 ells (14.3 metres).|$|E
