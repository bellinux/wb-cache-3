40|$|Based on {{the logic}} of the Lacanian mirror paradigm, Pierre Legendre claims that every culture needs to create a metaphysical entity of Reference, {{for the sake of the}} legiti- macy and {{validity}} of its normative system. This entity disguises the abyss at the core of culture and legitimates it by staging itself as its origin. As such, the Reference not only authenticates individual and cultural subjectivity, but also becomes the founda- tion of law. Given that Legendre attributes a fundamental role to aesthetics in the cre- ation of this entity, my essay will identify the role of literature in this respect, arguing that, on the one hand, literary texts help confirming the readers’ attachment to a spe- cific <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>Reference,</b> i. e. of normativity and imagery. On the other hand, my essay claims that literature also has the capacity to reflect on the basis of cultural normativity and to unveil the contingency of normative truths. This results from what I call the cultural structures of testimony. Thus literature unleashes emancipatory forces with regard to a culture’s normative system. The essay tests this hypothesis by analysing E. T. A. Hoffmann’s The Sandman, a narrative that because of its play with the catego- ries of fiction and reality is particularly salient...|$|E

40|$|Croatia has {{introduced}} a number of reforms to contain pharmaceutical expenditure whilst increasing access to new medicines. These include new regulations and new ordinances in 2013 including the pricing of new medicines and lowering the price of generics. Describe changes in the 2013 ordinance for new and established medicines in Croatia and the potential savings to provide future guidance. Methods: Descriptive review of the new ordinances for pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals and calculations of potential savings from the various initiatives. There were changes in the ordinance for the pricing of new medicines in Croatia including the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> priced countries. There were also changes in the pricing of biosimilars as well as comparator levels with other countries. Projections show that with the new ordinance, ambulatory care expenditure for the 54 product groups (internal reference price system) will be reduced by 9. 64 % (318. 4 million kunas) and prices of new medicines lowered by 8 to 10 % following changes {{in the order of}} referenced price countries. This paper demonstrates that changes in the reference pricing system can lead to considerable differences in overall reimbursed expenditure. In addition, European countries with smaller populations can be active with introducing a variety of measures to keep pharmaceutical expenditure under control whilst increasing access to new medicines.

40|$|Abstract Background Reference {{genes are}} used as {{internal}} standards to normalize mRNA abundance in quantitative real-time PCR and thereby allow a direct comparison between samples. So far most of these expression studies used human or classical laboratory model species whereas studies on non-model organism under in-situ conditions are quite rare. However, only studies in free-ranging populations can reveal the effects of natural selection on the expression levels of functional important genes. In order to test the feasibility of gene expression studies in wildlife samples we transferred and validated potential reference genes that were developed for lab mice (Mus musculus) to samples of wild yellow-necked mice, Apodemus flavicollis. The stability and suitability of eight potential reference genes was accessed by the programs BestKeeper, NormFinder and geNorm. Findings Although the three programs used different algorithms the ranking <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> genes was significantly concordant and geNorm differed in only one, NormFinder in two positions compared to BestKeeper. The genes ordered by their mean rank from the most to the least stable gene were: Rps 18, Sdha, Canx, Actg 1, Pgk 1, Ubc, Rpl 13 a and Actb. Analyses of the normalization factor revealed best results when the five most stable genes were included for normalization. Discussion We established a SYBR green qPCR assay for liver samples of wild A. flavicollis and conclude that five genes {{should be used for}} appropriate normalization. Our study provides the basis to investigate differential expression of genes under selection under natural selection conditions in liver samples of A. flavicollis. This approach might also be applicable to other non-model organisms. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{doctoral}} dissertation “Viva vox iuris” {{is aimed at}} extending the research on law and literature by developping a new perspective, based on Pierre Legendre’s “dogmatic anthropology”. Starting with {{an overview of the}} current state of research in this field, and based on a detailed presentation of Legendre’s theory, the dissertation develops the hypothesis that the deep entanglement of law and literature confers upon literature the capacity of either reinforcing the effectivity of cultural normativity, or of influencing it {{in the sense of a}} modificatory force. The plausibility of this hypothesis is then assessed by a thorough analysis of Kafka’s The Trial and Hoffmann’s The Sandman. The Trial is presented as being a novel that stages the failure of interpretation on the diegetic, hermeneutic as well as the production level, i. e. with regard to the author (– interpretation being, from Legendre’s perspective, the fundamental cultural technique assuring a non-delusional human existence). Being confronted with this failure and the consequent lack of a regime of sense, the reader gains insight, ex negativo, into the necessity of being inscribed, by way of interpretation, into an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>Reference</b> that needs to be mediated by literature and law. With regard to The Sandman, the dissertation undertakes to show, through a combination of the concept of testimony with the dogmatic-anthropological core concepts of alterity and representation, how the fantastical blurring of the limits between reality and fiction, as staged in the novel, provides insights into the contingency of the fundamental structure of the normative order of cultural and subjective identity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To obtain {{reliable}} quantitative real-time PCR data, normalization {{relative to}} stable housekeeping genes (HKGs) is required. However, in practice, expression levels of 'typical' housekeeping genes {{have been found}} to vary between tissues and under different experimental conditions. To date, validation studies of reference genes in pigs are relatively rare and have never been performed in porcine alveolar macrophages (AMs). In this study, expression stability of putative housekeeping genes were identified in the porcine AMs in response to the stimulation with two pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Three different algorithms (geNorm, Normfinder and BestKeeper) were applied to assess the stability of HKGs. Results The mRNA expression stability of nine commonly used reference genes (B 2 M, BLM, GAPDH, HPRT 1, PPIA, RPL 4, SDHA, TBP and YWHAZ) was determined by qRT-PCR in AMs that were stimulated by LPS and LTA in vitro. mRNA expression levels of all genes were found to be affected by the type of stimulation and duration of the stimulation (P SDHA, B 2 M and RPL 4 showed a high expression stability in the irrespective to the stimulation group, while SDHA, YWHAZ and RPL 4 showed high stability in non-stimulated control group.

40|$|Abstract Background Gene {{expression}} {{analysis using}} real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) is increasingly important in biological research {{due to the}} high-throughput and accuracy of qRT-PCR. For accurate and reliable gene expression analysis, normalization of gene expression data against housekeeping genes or internal control genes is required. The stability of reference genes has a tremendous effect {{on the results of}} relative quantification of gene expression by qRT-PCR. The expression stability of reference genes could vary according to tissues, age of individuals and experimental conditions. In the pig however, very little information is available on the expression stability of reference genes. The aim of this research was therefore to develop a new set of reference genes which can be used for normalization of mRNA expression data of genes expressed in varieties of porcine tissues at different ages. Results The mRNA expression stability of nine commonly used reference genes (B 2 M, BLM, GAPDH, HPRT 1, PPIA, RPL 4, SDHA, TBP and YWHAZ) was determined in varieties of tissues collected from newborn, young and adult pigs. geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper software were used to rank the genes according to their stability. geNorm software revealed that RPL 4, PPIA and YWHAZ showed high stability in newborn and adult pigs, while B 2 M, YWHAZ and SDHA showed high stability in young pigs. In all cases, GAPDH showed the least stability in geNorm. NormFinder revealed that TBP was the most stable gene in newborn and young pigs, while PPIA was most stable in adult pigs.
