Perry was feuding with Indians player/manager Frank Robinson. Perry would win nearly 80 more games in his career than the three combined. With the Rangers, Perry formed a <b>one-two</b> <b>punch</b> with Ferguson Jenkins, with Perry earning 12 wins, and Jenkins 11, during the remainder of 1975. However, the Rangers, who had finished 2nd in the AL West in 1974, slipped to 3rd place that year.|$|E

They {{remained}} {{a force to be}} reckoned with throughout the decade, with Hull enjoying four 50-goal seasons, Mikita winning back-to-back scoring titles and MVP accolades, Pilote winning three consecutive Norris Trophies, and Hall being named the First or Second All-Star goaltender eight out of nine seasons. Hull and Mikita especially were widely regarded as the most feared <b>one-two</b> <b>punch</b> in the league. However, despite a strong supporting cast which included Bill Hay, Ken Wharram, Phil Esposito, Moose Vasko, Doug Mohns and Pat Stapleton, the Hawks never quite put it all together.|$|E

Merritt was led by the <b>one-two</b> <b>punch</b> of Casey Pierro-Zabotel and Wade MacLeod, who finished third and fourth respectively in BCHL scoring. Zabotel posted 116 points in 55 games while MacLeod chipped in 105 points in 60 games. Zabotel also represented the Centennials on the gold medal winning team at the inaugural World Junior A Challenge. The post-season saw the Cents fight hard only to lose in the seventh game of the opening round against the Trail Smoke Eaters. After the season, Zabotel won Interior Conference most valuable player, marking the first time ever that a Centennials player had claimed that award in back to back seasons. At the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, Zabotel became just the fourth player in franchise history to be drafted directly to the NHL when the Pittsburgh Penguins chose him in the 3th round, 80th overall. He is the highest player ever drafted directly from the Centennials to the NHL.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{opened their}} next road trip with a 5–4 defeat to the Milwaukee Brewers that snapped the six game win streak. The Brewers won on a walk-off double by George Kottaras off of Javy Guerra {{in the bottom}} of the ninth. The Dodgers {{suffered}} their second straight defeat in walk-off fashion the next night when Nyjer Morgan scored on a sacrifice fly by Ryan Braun {{in the bottom of}} the 10th inning. Matt Kemp hit his seventh home run of the season in the series finale to help the Dodgers avoid the sweep. Two good defensive plays at third base by Jerry Hairston, Jr. helped the Dodgers hold on to a 4-3 victory. The Dodgers next traveled to Houston for a matchup with the Astros. In the opener, the <b>one-two</b> <b>punch</b> of Kemp & Ethier again accounted for all the Dodgers runs in a 3–1 victory. Clayton Kershaw picked up his first win of the season in the next game as he struck out nine and only allowed three hits in seven scoreless innings. Kemp hit his ninth home run of the season and James Loney his first in the Dodgers 5-1 win over the Astros. The Dodgers road trip ended on a sour note as they got pounded by the Astros 12–0. Billingsley allowed nine runs in only 3 innings, including a grand slam home run by Jordan Schafer.|$|E

50|$|Bentil {{broke out}} during his sophomore campaign, {{and he and}} {{teammate}} Kris Dunn - a consensus All-American - {{became one of the}} top <b>one-two</b> <b>punches</b> in college basketball. He led the Big East Conference with 21.1 points per game, 7.7 rebounds per game, field goal makes (246) and free throw makes (194). He also finished fifth in the conference in field goal percentage (46.2 percent), sixth in free throw percentage (78.2 percent), fourth in rebounds per game (7.7) and third in win shares (3.8). He started 32 of Providence's 35 games, scored in double-figures on 31 occasions, notched at least 20 points 21 times and tallied at least 30 points five times. Bentil recorded 31 points and a career-high-tying 13 rebounds on January 24 during an overtime win on the home court of eventual NCAA champion Villanova. Two and a half weeks later, he scored a career-best 42 points during a double-overtime loss at Marquette. The effort included a 14-for-17 clip from the free throw line and 12 rebounds. He hovered right around his season averages during the Friars' two-game NCAA tournament run, posting 20.0 PPG and 6.0 RPG. He played all 40 minutes of Providence's first-round effort against USC, recording 19 points and nine rebounds during the 70-69 win. The Friars then lost in the second round to eventual NCAA runner-up UNC, despite a 50-point combined effort from Bentil and Dunn. At the close of the season, Bentil was named first-team All-Big East and the conference's most improved player.|$|R

With its furious back-and-forth solos, opening instrumental 'Dialectic Chaos' wastes no time in showcasing that dynamic between Mustaine and Broderick, and combined with the pure speed of 'This Day We Fight!', longtime fans will be instantly reminded of the bracing 'Into the Lungs of Hell'/'Set the World Afire' <b>one-two</b> <b>punch</b> that kicks off 1988's great So Far, So Good...

Gibron felt that the two-part episodes were [...] "a <b>one-two</b> <b>punch</b> that many dramatic series would die for", finding the conclusion to have been effectively hinted at throughout the season.

Shearman felt that the episode would have been [...] "the best end to the show imaginable", had the series not produced a third season. He considered the episode's writing and conclusion to have been a brave decision, potentially alienating its viewers but producing [...] "a thrilling and unforgettable piece of television"; he also considered the season as a whole to be less consistent but more daring than the first season.|$|E

He carried top weight of 119 pounds and started as the 2–5 {{favorite}} against six opponents, headed by the Todd Pletcher-trained Madefromlucky. The colt led from the start and drew away in the closing stages to win by six and a quarter lengths. Espinoza called the winner [...] "an amazing horse", while Baffert was satisfied with the run, especially as the colt returned with a twisted shoe which would have hampered his progress. Four weeks later at the same track, American Pharoah started as the odds-on favorite against seven opponents in the Grade I Arkansas Derby. After racing in second place behind outsider Bridget's Big Luvy, he took the lead {{a quarter of a mile}} from the finish and steadily increased his advantage to win by eight lengths from Southwest Stakes winner Far Right. Baffert noted, [...] "He's matured substantially. He's a good horse and he keeps moving forward. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but Dortmund is another one who we don't yet know how good he is.

[...] "Cry Wolf" [...] would be the last A-ha single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. After the release of the album, A-ha toured in the US, its last appearance there for 20 years.

Barry Ward of XXL gave the album an XL rating, saying [...] "Phantom And The Ghost spends less time bragging or detailing street life, and more time pondering how things came to be and if it’ll ever end.

500|$|In 2003, Ramirez again posted strong {{offensive}} numbers, {{finishing with}} a [...]325 average, 37 home runs, and 104 RBI. The second half surge of newly acquired fellow Dominican slugger David Ortiz gave the Red Sox a formidable <b>one-two</b> <b>punch</b> {{in the middle}} of the lineup with Ramirez. However, in the summer, Ramirez missed several games with pharyngitis, but got into hot water as he was spotted in a bar in the hotel where he lived with a close friend, Yankees infielder Enrique Wilson, despite being supposedly too ill to play in the series against the rival Yankees. Ramirez and Wilson both maintained that Manny was just talking to his friend in that setting, and not actually drinking or partying as the media speculated. Boston manager Grady Little benched Ramirez for one game as a result. Despite this distraction, the Red Sox finished the season 95-67, qualifying for the MLB postseason for the first time with Ramirez. In the decisive fifth game of their Division Series matchup against the Oakland Athletics, Ramirez broke a 6th inning 1-1 tie by launching a go-ahead three-run homer off Barry Zito that set up an ALCS showdown with the rival Yankees. In ALCS Game 3, Ramirez was at the center of a bench-clearing brawl. Early in the game, Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martínez had hit Yankees outfielder Karim Garcia up high with a pitch, sparking heated dialogue, and a hard slide by Garcia into Red Sox second baseman Todd Walker had exacerbated the tensions. The very next inning, Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens threw a pitch high and inside to Ramirez, and Manny charged the mound, sparking the melee. The Red Sox lost the game 4-3. Despite Ramirez's strong play in the ALCS against the Yankees (.310 with 2 home runs), the Red Sox fell to the Yankees in the decisive seventh game on Aaron Boone's infamous extra-inning, walk-off home run.|$|E

In addition, Muller divided her playing time between pitching and first base, hitting a [...]236 average with 18 runs and 30 RBI in 75 games. South Bend dispossed of the Fort Wayne Daisies {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, two games to one, and later defeated the Rockford Peaches in the best-of-five-series to clinch the championship title. Considering that Rockford had won nine straight games, including the first two games in the championship series, South Bend came away a surprise winner to clinch the club's first AAGPBL title in the league, by combining deep pitching with an opportune hitting.

2500|$|In {{spite of}} Dungy's success at {{coaching}} Tampa Bay into a winner, {{one of the}} consistent criticisms from the media and from fans—and later, from players including Warren Sapp—was that the defense was expected to shoulder {{too much of the}} responsibility for winning games. [...] Beyond fullback Mike Alstott and running back Warrick Dunn—who served as a <b>one-two</b> <b>punch</b> ground attack—and wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, the team was otherwise underwhelming on offense. [...] Despite the ongoing criticism, Dungy remained staunchly loyal to his coaching staff, but {{at the conclusion of the}} 1999 season, general manager Rich McKay forced Dungy to fire offensive coordinator Mike Shula. [...] He was replaced by former Minnesota Vikings and Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator Les Steckel in 2000, and the result was the Bucs' highest-scoring season ever, another 106 record, and another trip to the playoffs as a wild card. despite his transformation of the team's offense, Steckel's drill sergeant approach to coaching (he was a colonel in the Marines) was a poor fit for the franchise.

2500|$|Ryan P. Doom {{explains}} how the violence devolves {{as the film}} progresses. [...] "The savagery of American violence," [...] he says, [...] "begins with Chigurh's introduction: a quick <b>one-two</b> <b>punch</b> of strangulation and a bloody cattle gun. The strangulation in particular demonstrates {{the level of the}} Coens' capability to create realistic carnage-to allow the audience to understand the horror that violence delivers.....Chigurh kills a total of 12 (possibly more) people, and, curiously enough, the violence devolves as the film progresses. During {{the first half of the}} film, the Coens never shy from unleashing Chigurh ... The devolution of violence starts with Chigurh's shootout with Moss in the motel. Aside from the truck owner who is shot in the head after Moss flags him down, both the motel clerk and Wells's death occur offscreen. Wells's death in particular demonstrates that murder means nothing. Calm beyond comfort, the camera pans away when Chigurh shoots Wells with a silenced shotgun as the phone rings. He answers. It is Moss, and while they talk, blood oozes across the room toward Chigurh's feet. Not moving, he places his feet up on the bed and continues the conversation as the blood continues to spread across the floor. By the time he keeps his promise of visiting Carla Jean, the resolution and the violence appear incomplete. Though we're not shown Carla Jean's death, when Chigurh exits and checks the bottom of his socks [...] for blood, it's a clear indication that his brand of violence has struck again." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{several years}} of {{retirement}} from the fashion industry, French designer Thierry Mugler served as the main costume designer for the tour. Knowles was attracted with {{his work at the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala, [...] "Superheroes, Fashion and Fantasy" [...] (2008), where several of his haute couture pieces were on display. Knowles immediately {{fell in love with the}} costumes and wanted to use them on her tour after her mother and designer Tina Knowles influenced her decision. She met with Mugler in Paris in September and started exchanging ideas with him, further designing costumes which were inspired by her love of music and life. She hired him as the designer for the tour costumes in November, 2008. Speaking about her collaboration, Knowles said, [...] "The best part about this tour is I'm working with Thierry Mugler, who is an icon and a legend, and I've been a fan." [...] Mugler wanted to capture the duality between being a woman and a warrior and understand these two sides with [...] own perception of both aspects while creating the costumes for Knowles and using the words [...] "Feminine. Free. Warrior. Fierce" [...] as inspiration. He felt, [...] "Sasha Fierce is another aspect of Beyoncé's personality, she is Fierce on stage and Beyoncé in real life... Beyoncé is a very sophisticated 'stage animal', which means that she is truly instinctive. Beyoncé expresses herself through the two aspects of her personality. On stage, there is Sasha Fierce and there is Beyoncé in her truest self." [...] He described the costumes as [...] "very elaborate" [...] and rooted in the songs' meanings. He conducted a 71-piece wardrobe for Knowles, her dancers and the band for the tour. For the shows, Knowles had ten different looks which were noted to be [...] "fierce" [...] as her onstage alter ego. She wore [...] "ferocious power-glam superheroine outfits for a <b>one-two</b> <b>punch</b> of femininity and fierceness". American fashion designer Chris March also collaborated with Knowles during the tour helping Mugler in the process of creating the costumes and making them usable for stage purposes as his expertise was execution of outfits. On July 23, 2009, March filled a lawsuit against Mugler for allegedly not paying him for the work he did on the wardrobe. Knowles' look captured a duality of soft and hard, combining bows with metal and incorporating fishnets, mismatched gloves and power shoulders into costumes that mirror Knowles' lyrics about [...] "all the single women" [...] femme fatales and power brokers in a [...] "high-tech Blade Runner world" [...] as stated by Michael Quintanilla of San Antonio Express-News. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone magazine noted that the wardrobe designs consisted of a variety of gold sparkly leotards, all form-fitting, light-reflecting and leg-baring. Knowles also wore leopard-print pants and glow-in-the-dark bra with a blinking beacon affixed to her body.
