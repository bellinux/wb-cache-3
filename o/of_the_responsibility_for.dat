5|$|It is a migratory {{passerine}} which {{winters in}} southern and western Europe, southern Asia and north Africa. Greenish-brown above and off-white below, it is named onomatopoeically for its simple chiff-chaff song. It {{has a number}} of subspecies, some of which are now treated as full species. The female builds a domed nest on or near the ground, and assumes most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> brooding and feeding the chicks, whilst the male has little involvement in nesting, but defends his territory against rivals, and attacks potential predators.|$|E
5|$|Patterson and Langdon both {{claimed to}} control a {{majority}} of the company's stock, and in February 1893, rival boards of directors were elected by stockholders loyal to those two figures. The issue of 600 shares to Patterson, authorized in 1891, turned the issue, and its validity was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and Patterson's board of directors ordered seated. Langdon promptly petitioned for a receivership, and was appointed joint receiver with Patterson. Patterson, however, took most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> operations. He was responsible having wyes installed at Wopsononock and Juniata in late 1894 so that the railroad's engines did not have to back down the mountain. The co-receivership was lifted on July 6, 1896, and Patterson took full control of the railroad again. However, the railroad failed to cover its operating expenses shortly thereafter, and Patterson was re-appointed receiver on September 28, 1896. On February 29, 1897, it was sold under foreclosure to William L. Shellenberger, on behalf of the bondholders—the group which had allied with Langdon. On March 17, 1897, it was reorganized as the Altoona and Beech Creek Railroad.|$|E

5|$|Pope's {{reputation}} {{suffered a}} serious blow in 1879 when a late-convened Board of Inquiry called by President Rutherford B. Hayes {{and led by}} Maj. Gen. John Schofield (Pope's immediate predecessor in the Department of the Missouri and then head of the Department of the Pacific) concluded that Major General Fitz John Porter had been unfairly convicted of cowardice and disobedience at the Second Battle of Bull Run. The Schofield report used evidence of former Confederate commanders and concluded that Pope himself bore most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the Union loss. The report characterized Pope as reckless and dangerously uninformed about events during the battle, also criticized General Irvin McDowell (whom Pope detested), and credited Porter's perceived disobedience with saving the Union army from complete ruin. Soon, Schofield himself was criticized for his actions as superintendent of the U.S. Military at West Point following the hazing of an African American cadet.|$|E
5|$|Reid {{occupied}} high-ranking cabinet {{positions in}} Greenfield's government {{and that of}} his successor, John Edward Brownlee. Greenfield appointed him Minister of Health and Minister of Municipal Affairs in 1921. In the former capacity, he drew on his past experience with the Vermilion board in establishing new municipal health boards. He also proposed a program of eugenics through the sterilisation of the mentally handicapped, which in 1928 led to the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta. As an advocate of government-wide economy, he laid off all school inspection nurses and many public health nurses. This inclination towards thrift was also evident in his performance as Minister of Municipal Affairs, in which he resisted a 1926 call from several municipalities to transfer a greater proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> caring for indigents to the province. In 1929, he disagreed with them again when he insisted that they be responsible for 10% of the old age pensions paid to their residents.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{national}} laboratories passed to the newly created Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) on January 1, 1947. That year, Lawrence asked for $15 million for his projects, which included a new linear accelerator and a new gigaelectronvolt synchrotron which {{became known as the}} bevatron. The University of California's contract to run the Los Alamos laboratory was due to expire on July 1, 1948, and some board members wished to divest the university <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> running a site outside California. After some negotiation, the university agreed to extend the contract for what was now the Los Alamos National Laboratory for four more years, and to appoint Norris Bradbury, who had replaced Oppenheimer as its director in October 1945, as a professor. Soon after, Lawrence received all the funds he had requested.|$|E

25|$|In turn, {{the role}} of {{government}} in the national economy had become associated with the assumption by the state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> assuring its citizens of a degree of economic well-being.

Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> the committee’s work, however, was delegated to Wang Sheng, intelligence chief Mao Jen-feng (Mao Renfang) and others (the PAC was renamed the Political Work Department in 1950, and the General Political Warfare Department in 1963).

He served {{throughout}} the war, mostly on the Western Front, and mostly as a Staff Officer, though he was eventually given his own Corps and made a General der Infanterie. Blumentritt was instrumental in planning the 1939 German invasion of Poland and the 1940 invasion of France, he participated in Operation Barbarossa, and afterward bore a large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> planning the defense of the Atlantic Wall and Normandy.

25|$|When the Crimean War {{ended in}} 1856, {{many of the}} local units that had been raised {{declined}} as the enthusiasm of Victorians for military service dwindled. Around this time, the rifle regiments and corps that had been raised were converted to artillery. When British troops began to be redirected from the Australian colonies to New Zealand in the early 1860s there was renewed interest in Victoria for raising local forces to take over more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> garrison duties. From 1861 Victorian forces undertook annual training at Easter with the first camp being undertaken at Werribee. The Volunteer Act was passed in 1863, and this legislation allowed the government to raise a voluntary force consisting of various arms including infantry and artillery. There were around 13 companies of infantry volunteers in Victoria at this time, From 1863 all mounted troops in Victoria {{became part of the}} Prince of Wales' Light Horse. By December 1863, along with the 13 companies of infantry, there was one company of engineers and seven of artillery.|$|E
25|$|The {{institutional}} {{framework for the}} water and sanitation sector has undergone many successive changes, including some reforms that were never implemented and some that considerably changed the responsibilities in the sector. Two reforms that had a lasting impact were the transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> {{water supply and sanitation}} from municipalities to the national government in the late 1960s {{and the creation of a}} national water holding company in 1981 consisting of utilities in the large cities. In 1990, the government gave service responsibility in urban areas back to the municipalities. The new government of Fujimori introduced a policy of promoting the private sector and of commercializing the municipal utilities. In 1994 an autonomous regulatory agency was created at the national level. In the meantime the program to promote the private sector stalled: Only in 2005 the first and so far only water concession in Peru was awarded in the city of Tumbes. In 2006, a new government launched a massive investment program called Agua Para Todos (Water for All).|$|E
