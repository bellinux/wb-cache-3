They first entered the FA Cup in the 1881–82 season. When nationally organised league football in England began, the club, by then called simply Small Heath F.C., was a founder member of the Football Alliance, formed the year after the Football League. In 1892, the Football League decided to form a Second Division, inviting the members of the Football Alliance to join; as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> successful members, Small Heath were placed in the Second Division. Since that time the club's first team has competed in numerous nationally and internationally organised competitions, and all players who have played in 100 or more such matches are listed below.|$|E

5|$|All {{members of}} the class entered British Railways service in 1948, and from 1955 23 of the U class {{received}} chimneys of the British Railways Standard Class 4 variety and replacement cylinders, which had become worn through intensive use. A few {{members of the}} class were given replacement frames at overhaul with a shallower curve between the front buffer beam and smokebox. During the early 1960s, the withdrawal of the ageing T9 class designed by Dugald Drummond saw the U class replacing them on services west of Exeter, though their large wheels offered little advantage on the steeper gradients that characterised this part of the railway network. The favoured form of 2-6-0 motive power west of Exeter was the smaller-wheeled N class, while heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid’s Unrebuilt Light Pacifics, which were within the weight restrictions imposed in this area.

5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of Sumatran rhino populations has identified three distinct genetic lineages. The channel between Sumatra and Malaysia {{was not as}} significant a barrier for the rhinos as the Barisan Mountains {{along the length of}} Sumatra, for rhinos in eastern Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia are more closely related than the rhinos {{on the other side of}} the mountains in western Sumatra. In fact, the eastern Sumatra and Malaysia rhinos show so little genetic variance, the populations were likely not separate during the Pleistocene, when sea levels were much lower and Sumatra formed part of the mainland. Both populations of Sumatra and Malaysia, however, are close enough genetically that interbreeding would not be problematic. The rhinos of Borneo are sufficiently distinct that conservation geneticists have advised against crossing their lineages with the other populations. Conservation geneticists have recently begun to study the diversity of the gene pool within these populations by identifying microsatellite loci. The results of initial testing found levels of variability within Sumatran rhino populations comparable to those in the population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> endangered African rhinos, but the genetic diversity of Sumatran rhinos is an area of continuing study.|$|E
5|$|It {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future, given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of einsteinium-254, which is favoured for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms,Es|journal=Journal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Less</b> Common Metals|volume=122|pages=411–417|year=1986|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(86)90435-2|first10=R.

L.|displayauthors=9}} to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level; einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories, and in quantities smaller than those needed for effective synthesis of ultraheavy elements. However, given that ununennium is only the first period 8 element on the extended periodic table, it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions, and indeed attempts to synthesise it in 2019 and 2020 are currently planned at laboratories at Japan and Russia. Currently, none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet, and it is also possible, due to drip instabilities, that only the lower period 8 elements, up to around element 128, are physically possible. No attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals, such as unhexpentium, due to their extremely high atomic number: they would require new, more powerful technology to make.|$|E
5|$|Some {{variation}} {{is seen in}} the 12 subspecies of house sparrows, which are divided into two groups, the Oriental P. d. indicus group, and the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group. Birds of the P. d. domesticus group have grey cheeks, while P. d. indicus group birds have white cheeks, as well as bright colouration on the crown, a smaller bill, and a longer black bib. The subspecies P. d. tingitanus differs little from the nominate subspecies, except in the worn breeding plumage of the male, in which the head is speckled with black and underparts are paler. P. d. balearoibericus is slightly paler than the nominate, but darker than P. d. bibilicus. P. d. bibilicus is paler than most subspecies, but has the grey cheeks of P. d. domesticus group birds.
