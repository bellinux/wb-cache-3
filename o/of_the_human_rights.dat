5|$|Section 3 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> Act 1998 is a {{provision}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> Act 1998 {{that enables the}} Act to take effect in the United Kingdom. The section requires courts to interpret both primary and subordinate legislation so that their provisions are compatible with the articles of the European Convention of Human Rights, which are also part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> Act 1998. This interpretation goes far beyond normal statutory interpretation, and includes past and future legislation, therefore preventing the Human Rights act from being impliedly repealed by subsequent contradictory legislation.|$|E

5|$|Goldstone was {{promoted}} to the Supreme Court of South Africa in 1989, a post which he took up in October 1990 after a year's study at Harvard University. As one of three judges on the Supreme Court's appellate panel, he upheld a majority of appeals to the court. He also served as the founding national president of the National Institute of Crime Prevention and the Rehabilitation of Offenders (NICRO), a body established to look after prisoners who had been released; chairperson of the Bradlow Foundation, a charitable educational trust; {{and head of the}} board <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> Institute of South Africa (HURISA).|$|E

The tournament was won by Russia, Finland won silver and Sweden won bronze defeating the Czech republic.|$|E
5|$|When {{she brings}} the scandal to the {{attention}} of the UN, Kathryn discovers that it has been covered up to protect lucrative defense and security contracts. However, she finds allies in her investigation: Madeleine Rees, head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> Commission, and internal-affairs specialist Peter Ward. When Raya is found dead, Kathryn sends an email to fifty senior mission personnel detailing her findings; she is then fired from her job. She and Ward acquire evidence of an official admitting the scandal before she is forced to leave the country, and she brings it to the BBC News. The final credits note that after Kathryn's departure, a number of peacekeepers were sent home (although none faced criminal charges because of immunity laws), and the U.S. continues doing business with private contractors such as Democra Security (including billion-dollar contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan).|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{the city}} gained a {{reputation}} as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, {{as well as the}} student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group Students for a Democratic Society took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. teach-in against the Vietnam War. During the ensuing 15 years, many countercultural and New Left enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city. These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> Party (HRP) won city council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives fought for measures including pioneering antidiscrimination ordinances, measures decriminalizing marijuana possession, and a rent-control ordinance; many of these remain in effect in modified form. Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small group of conservative institutions were born in Ann Arbor. These include Word of God (established in 1967), a charismatic inter-denominational movement; and the Thomas More Law Center (established in 1999), a religious-conservative advocacy group.|$|E

40|$|The {{right to}} {{equal access to}} health care is a {{fundamental}} principle that is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to health care. For victims of a violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to equal {{access to health care}} it is important that a judicial or quasi-judicial <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> body can adjudicate their complaints in this regard. Justiciability contributes to the protection and realisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right to equal access to health care and further determines <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> this <b>right.</b> <b>The</b> justiciability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to equal access to health care is complex. It is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic, social and cultural rights, and ever since <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> these rights, their justiciability has been a contentious issue. Moreover, in practice it is much more difficult for an alleged violation of an economic, social or cultural right to be subject of review by a court of law or a quasi-judicial procedure than it is for a civil or political right. Nevertheless, {{over the last two decades}} several developments at international United Nations and regional Council of Europe <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> level have strengthened <b>the</b> justiciability <b>of</b> economic, social and cultural rights, which also has implications for <b>the</b> justiciability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to equal access to health care. This book analyses <b>the</b> justiciability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to equal access to health care. It examines how cases concerning unequal access to health care would be dealt with by judicial and quasi-judicial <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> bodies and distils the elements that can be expected to play a role in <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> such cases. Firstly, it provides for an extensive analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to equal access to health care, its entitlements and corresponding State obligations. Subsequently, it addresses what arguments are brought forward with regard to <b>the</b> justiciability <b>of</b> economic, social and cultural rights in general and how these <b>rights,</b> including <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to health care, are adjudicated in practice by the various judicial and quasijudicial <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> bodies. Furthermore, <b>the</b> case law <b>of</b> three <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> bodies – <b>the</b> European Committee <b>of</b> Social <b>Rights,</b> <b>the</b> European Court <b>of</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Rights,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Rights</b> Committee – is examined in detail in order to analyse how these bodies assess cases concerning discrimination and how elements of economic, social and cultural rights are taken into account under the various equality and non-discrimination provisions. Finally, the different criteria and elements that can be expected to play a role in <b>the</b> justiciability <b>of</b> cases concerning <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> to equal access to health care are presented...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{looks at}} <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> for decent {{life and its}} direct link with {{education}} that facilitates <b>the</b> observance <b>of</b> civil, political, economic and cultural rights and is regarded both as a condition and consequence <b>of</b> fulfilling <b>the</b> decent life idea. <b>The</b> chances <b>of</b> a non-educated and poorly educated people for the decent life are doubtful, not to speak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{civil and political rights}} that can’t be properly exploited.   The authors give the retrospective analysis concerning <b>the</b> formation process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> for decent life; its theoretical and practical variations including the domestic ones being described along with <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> its ethical content reflected in normative legal acts and indices of economic development. Education leads to demy- thologizing and rejecting <b>the</b> ideological aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above <b>human</b> <b>right</b> idea, <b>the</b> latter being the necessary complex universal multifunctional instrument for social self- development, rather then a judicial phenomenon. The authors made an attempt to reconcile <b>the</b> pathos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>right</b> adherents and <b>the</b> skeptics reducing the idea to the declarative unverifiable myth or ideology. The research output can be used both for goal-setting in educational sphere and normative legal acts development concerning education and <b>human</b> <b>rights.</b>   </div...|$|R
