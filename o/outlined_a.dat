5|$|At {{the time}} it was known that the drag at {{supersonic}} speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing. This led to the use of very short-span, very thin rectangular wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or in aircraft like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter or the Avro 730 that the team studied. The team <b>outlined</b> <b>a</b> baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.|$|E
5|$|Brown's 2000 Spending Review <b>outlined</b> <b>a</b> major {{expansion}} of government spending, particularly {{on health and}} education. In his April 2002 budget, Brown increased National Insurance {{to pay for health}} spending. He also introduced working tax credits, and in his last budget as Chancellor, Brown gave an extra £3billion in pension allowances, an increase in the child tax credit, and an increase in the working tax credit. These increases were followed by another £1billion of support for increases in the child tax credit.|$|E

5|$|During a rainy {{holiday in}} Hastings {{at the end}} of November 1903, Potter <b>outlined</b> <b>a</b> tale about a cat, a dog, and a tea party she called Something very very NICE. She {{discussed}} the Lakefield sketches as backgrounds for the tale with Warne. He proposed a large format volume similar to L. Leslie Brooke's Johnny Crow's Garden to do justice to the detail of the illustrations, but the entire project was set aside when The Tale of Benjamin Bunny and The Tale of Two Bad Mice were chosen for development and publication in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Further work {{along these}} lines led to the Nike-X Deployment Study, or DEPEX. DEPEX <b>outlined</b> <b>a</b> {{deployment}} that started out very similar to Nth Country, with a few bases primarily using Nike EX to provide lightweight cover, but which also included design features that allowed more bases to be added as {{the nature of the}} threat changed. The study described a four-phase deployment sequence that added more and more terminal defenses as the sophistication of the Nth Country missiles increased over time.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Potter sketched the {{interior}} of the third Lakefield Cottage belonging to a Mrs. Lord. These drawings included a watercolour and pen-and-ink sketches of the living-room, pen-and-ink sketches of the pots of geraniums on the living-room window sill, the entrance passage, the pantry, the stairs, some of the upstairs rooms, and details of the carved oak furniture. In some of the sketches Potter roughly <b>outlined</b> <b>a</b> cat. She also sketched the village including the sloping path down to the Lakefield Cottages and the post office door. These became the backgrounds for The Pie and The Patty-Pan.|$|E

As the series progresses, Lex's friendship with Clark crumbles until they consider themselves enemies. The role was difficult to cast; Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice and, feeling {{that he did not}} take his first audition seriously enough, <b>outlined</b> <b>a</b> two-and-a-half-page scene indicating where to be funny, charismatic or menacing. His second audition went so well that he was hired. Rosenbaum left the show after seven seasons, reprising his role for the series finale.|$|E
5|$|Poohsticks is {{considered}} to be a sport of chance yet some players claim skill is involved.

In any event, the turbulence around the bridge supports make the path of the stick very difficult to predict and may vary according to the season.|$|E

5|$|The {{switch from}} high-altitude to low-altitude flight {{profiles}} severely affected the B-70, whose design was highly tuned {{to provide the}} desired high-altitude performance. Planners <b>outlined</b> <b>a</b> series of low-level profiles for the B-70, but higher aerodynamic drag at low level limited the B-70 to subsonic speed while dramatically decreasing its range. The result would be an aircraft with somewhat higher subsonic speed than the B-52, but less range. Unsuited for the new low-altitude role, and because of a growing shift to the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, the B-70 bomber program was cancelled in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, and the two XB-70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program.|$|E
5|$|William Murrill in 1909 {{placed the}} {{species in the}} genus Suillellus, while Sanshi Imai {{transferred}} it to Tubiporus in 1968. Tubiporus has since been synonymized with Boletus. In 1945, Rolf Singer described a bolete he found in Florida; although he originally {{described it as a}} subspecies of B.frostii, he later considered the differences between the taxa significant enough to warrant publishing Boletus floridanus as a unique species. Following recent molecular studies that <b>outlined</b> <b>a</b> new phylogenetic framework for the Boletaceae, the bolete was transferred to the newly circumscribed genus Exsudoporus in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin's {{grandfather}} Erasmus Darwin <b>outlined</b> <b>a</b> {{hypothesis of}} transmutation of {{species in the}} 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.|$|E

5|$|From late 2008, the {{national}} team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances. Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled {{to qualify for the}} 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions as he played Messi out of position, positioned too deep for him to be able to contribute to the attack to his full ability. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona's stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4–0 victory over Venezuela. During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme. Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process. Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then <b>outlined</b> <b>a</b> 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the enganche in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.|$|E
5|$|In February 1992, European Union {{countries}} {{signed the}} Maastricht Treaty which <b>outlined</b> <b>a</b> three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first stage centered on liberalizing capital mobility and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries. The second stage established the European Monetary Institute which was ultimately dissolved {{in tandem with}} the establishment in 1998 of the European Central Bank (ECB) and European System of Central Banks. Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. The third and final stage introduced a common currency for circulation known as the Euro, adopted by eleven of then-fifteen members of the European Union in January 1999. In doing so, they disaggregated their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy. These countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders, exchangeable for euros at fixed rates, until 2002 when the ECB began issuing official Euro coins and notes. , the EMU comprises 17 nations which have issued the Euro, and 11 non-Euro states.|$|E
5|$|Plante {{also wrote}} {{extensively}} on hockey. He wrote hockey columns starting {{early in his}} career and was published in La Voix de Shawinigan, Le Samedi, and Sport Magazine. He alienated local reporters by writing a column for the local paper during his time as coach of the Quebec Nordiques. His seminal work, Goaltending, was published in 1972 in English, with the French edition (entitled Devant le filet) published in 1973. In his book, Plante <b>outlined</b> <b>a</b> program of goaltender development that included off-ice exercises, choice of equipment, styles of play, and game-day preparation. He also advised on best coaching methods for both young and advanced goaltenders. His book remained popular with coaches and players and was reprinted in both French and English in 1997, 25years after it was first published.|$|E

5000|$|A Humanist Manifesto, {{also known}} as Humanist Manifesto I to {{distinguish}} it from later Humanist Manifestos, was written in 1933 primarily by Raymond Bragg and was published with thirty-four signatories. Unlike the later ones, the first manifesto talked of a new [...] "religion", and referred to humanism as a religious movement meant to transcend and replace previous, deity-based religions. However, it is careful not to <b>outline</b> <b>a</b> creed or dogma. The document <b>outlines</b> <b>a</b> fifteen-point belief system, which, {{in addition to a}} secular outlook, opposes [...] "acquisitive and profit-motivated society" [...] and <b>outlines</b> <b>a</b> worldwide egalitarian society based on voluntary mutual cooperation. Bragg and eleven signatories were Unitarian ministers.|$|R

5|$|Richard {{gradually}} re-established royal {{authority in}} the months after the deliberations of the Merciless Parliament. The aggressive foreign policy of the Lords Appellant failed when their efforts to build a wide, anti-French coalition came to nothing, and the north of England fell victim to a Scottish incursion. Richard was now over twenty-one years old and could with confidence claim the right to govern in his own name. Furthermore, John of Gaunt returned to England in 1389 and settled his differences with the king, after which the old statesman acted as a moderating influence on English politics. Richard assumed full control of the government on 3 May 1389, claiming that the difficulties of the past years had been due solely to bad councillors. He <b>outlined</b> <b>a</b> foreign policy that reversed the actions of the appellants by seeking peace and reconciliation with France, and promised to lessen the burden of taxation on the people significantly. Richard ruled peacefully for the next eight years, having reconciled with his former adversaries. Still, later events would show that he had not forgotten the indignities he perceived. In particular, the execution of his former teacher Sir Simon de Burley was an insult not easily forgotten.|$|E
5|$|The first Academy plans <b>outlined</b> <b>a</b> £24 {{million grant}} for {{rebuilding}} Aveland and refurbishing Lafford. Despite {{a delay in}} 2008, the scheme was revived the following year: the three remaining schools would merge and up to £40 million of funds were being considered {{to pay for the}} redevelopment of each site. The chairman of the governors, Graham Arnold, pledged to raise £2 million towards the scheme. A feasibility report indicated that Aveland was not sustainable due to falling enrolment and would have to close; instead the remaining two sites would be redeveloped with £20 million of Government funding. The scheme was approved and, on 4 January 2010, St George's combined with Coteland's and Aveland to become St George's Academy. As planned, September 2012 saw the Billingborough site close and the remaining pupils transfer to the other sites. The oldest part of the Sleaford site was demolished and main building and sixth form centre constructed in its place, while new science and IT buildings were added and a new IT system rolled out; the original post-war buildings at the Ruskington site were pulled down and a new school built.|$|E
5|$|When {{registration}} commenced on October 16, 1940, no {{structure was}} in place to handle thousands of anticipated conscientious objectors. Church representatives meeting with government officials learned that little thought had been put into the program, and the churches were advised to create a plan. Because the government wanted to deal with one body, not individual religious denominations, the National Council for Religious Conscientious Objectors was formed as a liaison between the churches and the federal government. The historic peace churches <b>outlined</b> <b>a</b> plan that included running and maintaining CPS camps under church control. However, President Roosevelt opposed any plan not involving military control over the draftees. To save their plan and retain civilian direction of the program, the churches offered to fund the camps. Aides convinced Roosevelt that putting the COs to work in out-of-the-way camps was preferable to repeating the difficulties of World War I. Selective Service and the peace churches agreed to a six-month trial of church supported and funded camps for conscientious objectors and thus Civilian Public Service was born.|$|E
