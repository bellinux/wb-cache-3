5|$|Fodor {{also has}} {{positive}} arguments {{in favour of}} the reality of mental representations in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>LOT.</b> He maintains that if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E
5|$|In A Theory of Content and Other Essays (1990), Fodor {{takes up}} {{another of his}} central notions: the {{question}} of the reality of mental representations. Fodor needs to justify representational realism to justify the idea that the contents of mental states are expressed in symbolic structures such as those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>LOT.</b>|$|E

5|$|The station's {{parking lot}} {{has had a}} valet service since the station {{overhaul}} in 2007. The ongoing construction took up parking spaces, which spurred the village government to institute valet parking. The parking service has remained since the construction finished.

5|$|Exhausted by his labors {{during and}} after his {{scientific}} expedition to Egypt, Champollion died of an apoplectic attack (stroke) in Paris on the 4th of March 1832 {{at the age of}} 41. He is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery. On his tomb is a simple obelisk erected by his wife, and a stone slab stating simply: Ici repose Jean-François Champollion, né à Figeac dept. du Lot le 23 décembre 1790, décédé à Paris le 4 mars 1832 (Here rests Jean-François Champollion, born at Figeac, Department <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lot,</b> on 23 December 1790, died at Paris on 4 March 1832).|$|E
5|$|Construction was financed {{through a}} loan of NOK218 million from Handelsbanken, which was secured on the revenue {{which would be}} {{generated}} {{from the sale of}} Hamar stadion and Fuglsetmyra. However, the bank was not willing to lend money secured on the basis of sales price of Hamar stadion being based on the re-regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lot.</b> The municipality was pressed on time by the possibility of NFF denying Ham-Kam the right to play at Briskeby. Hamar Energi Holding AS (HEH), which owns Hamar Municipality's share of Eidsiva Energi, had large assets. Both HEH and BE1 had as chair Hans Kolstad, who proposed that HEH could issue a guarantee of NOK75 million for BG and BE1—which was issued in September 2007. This allowed construction to start, but the project was still under-financed by NOK50 million. HEH therefore issued another guarantee the same month, for NOK58.75 million. Because of delays in the regulation work, HEH issued another two guarantees, NOK60 million in March and NOK25 million in June 2008.|$|E

Seed lots were obtained through different methods <b>of</b> removing <b>the</b> seeds sarcotesta and stored in a refrigerator for 12 months. After this time, <b>the</b> <b>lots</b> were conditioned in PEG 6000 MPa/ 48 h - 0. 8 solution, - 1. 2 MPa/ 48 h PEG 6000 solution, 0. 34 KNO 3 M/ 48 h solution; H 2 O/ 24 h and H 2 O/ 48 h. The temperature during the treatments was 25 Celsius degrees. Seeds not conditioned were used in the control. The design was completely randomized with four replicates, and treatment in a factorial scheme (4 x 6 <b>lots</b> conditioning). <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treatments were tested by F test (< 0. 01). Papaya seeds KNO 3 solution conditioned accelerated <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> germination in seeds without sarcotesta, promoting favorable response in <b>the</b> vigor <b>of</b> seed <b>lots.</b> Accelerated aging reduced <b>the</b> germination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lots.</b> After aging, <b>the</b> conditioning in PEG solution promoted improvement in <b>the</b> physiological quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lots...</b>|$|R

5|$|Hamar Sportsanlegg (HSA) was {{established}} in 2003 to execute the plan. It was owned 34 percent by the municipality, and 22 percent each by Ham-Kam, Hamar IL and Storhamar Dragons. In 2004, Storhamar's share was transferred to Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, a municipal company which owns Vikingskipet Olympic Arena and Hamar Olympic Amphitheater. A report estimated the technical value of Briskeby to NOK6 million, while the sales price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> was estimated at NOK30 million. The municipal council voted on 18 February 2004 to transfer the ownership of the two stadiums to the new company. Ham-Kam rented the venues from HSA, with HSA's deficit {{for the first four}} years being covered by the municipality. Of the NOK20.8 million in value transferred to the company, NOK14.5 million was paid by HSA taking over the municipality's obligation to build a new athletics venue should Hamar stadion be closed, and NOK5 million was debt.|$|E
5|$|Ike Clanton, who {{had been}} {{threatening}} to kill the Earps for several months, including the day before, and Billy Claiborne were both unarmed. They ran from the fight unhurt. Wesley Fuller, a Cowboy {{who had been}} at the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lot,</b> left as soon as the firing began. Both Wyatt and Virgil believed Tom McLaury was armed and testified that he had fired at least one shot over the back of a horse. Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury exchanged gunfire with the lawmen. During the gunfight, Doc Holliday was bruised by a bullet fired by Frank that struck his holster and grazed his hip. Virgil Earp was shot through the calf, he thought by Billy Clanton. Morgan Earp was struck across both shoulder blades by a bullet that Morgan thought Frank McLaury had fired. Wyatt Earp was unhurt. Tom McLaury, his brother Frank, and Billy Clanton were killed.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Nordreisa Municipal Council {{attempted}} {{to change the}} airport's name from Sørkjosen to Nordreisa. They {{argued that it was}} necessary to use the Nordreisa name to market the region as a tourist destination. The application was rejected by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, who stated that airports were required by regulation to be named after a settlement rather than a municipality. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. This required the terminal to be slightly rebuilt; while it previously had a common departure and arrivals hall, it had to be separated into two areas. The municipality therefore decided to transfer the ownership of the ground handling service to the three employees. Avinor carried out a major upgrade to the runway safety area and landing lights in 2008 and 2009. The investments cost NOK40 million. The expansion of the safety area resulted in part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> of Birkelund Sawmill being expropriated.|$|E

500|$|In 1763, <b>the</b> Treaty <b>of</b> Paris {{resulted}} in <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> Prince Edward Island from France to the United Kingdom. In 1767, {{a system of}} land ownership was established in which the island was divided into 67 lots of about [...] each, with settlers living on parcels of this land rented out by the proprietors, or <b>the</b> owners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> land. Ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> land was determined by a lottery held in London, <b>the</b> winners <b>of</b> which were mostly political, business and military figures with connections {{to those in the}} British government. In 1769, under pressure from the proprietors who worried that a Nova Scotia legislature would force them to give up their property rights, the British government granted Prince Edward Island autonomy.|$|R
5|$|The thirty-five Tribes {{were not}} ethnic or kinship groups, {{but rather a}} generic {{division}} into which Roman citizens were distributed. When the Tribes were created the divisions were geographical, similar to modern Parliamentary constituencies. However, since one joined the same Tribe that one's father belonged to, the geographical distinctions were eventually lost. The order that the 35 Tribes voted in was selected randomly by lot. The order was not chosen at once, and after each Tribe had voted, a lot {{was used to determine}} which Tribe should vote next. The first Tribe selected was usually the most important Tribe, because it often decided the matter. It was believed that the order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> was chosen by the Gods, and thus, that the position held by the early voting Tribes was the position of the Gods. Once a majority of Tribes had voted the same way, voting ended.|$|E

25|$|By 1815 the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lot</b> to {{determine}} membership began to wane.

25|$|The site {{on which}} the Flatiron Building would stand was bought in 1857 by Amos Eno, who shortly built the Fifth Avenue Hotel on a site diagonally across from it. Eno tore down the four-story St. Germaine Hotel on the south end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lot,</b> and {{replaced}} it with a seven-story apartment building, the Cumberland. On the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lot</b> he built four three-story buildings for commercial use. This left four stories of the Cumberland's northern face exposed, which Eno rented out to advertisers, including The New York Times, who installed a sign made up of electric lights. Eno later put a canvas screen on the wall, and projected images onto it from a magic lantern on top of one of his smaller buildings, presenting advertisements and interesting pictures alternately.
