40|$|Automatic {{identification}} <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> calls without {{manual intervention}} {{has been a}} challenging task for meaningful research on the taxonomy and monitoring <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> migrations in ornithology. In this paper we apply several techniques used in speech recognition to the automatic identification <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> calls. A new technique which computes the ensemble average on the FFT spectrum is proposed for identification <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> calls. This ensemble average is computed on the FFT spectrum <b>of</b> each <b>bird</b> and is called the Spectral Ensemble Average Voice Print (SEAV) <b>of</b> that particular <b>bird.</b> The SEAV <b>of</b> various <b>birds</b> are computed and {{are found to be}} different when compared to each other. A database <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> calls is created from the available recordings <b>of</b> fifteen <b>bird</b> species. The SEAV is then used for the identification <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> calls from this database. The results of identification using SEAV are then compared against the results derived from common classifiers used in speech recognition like dynamic time warping (DTW), Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM). A one level and two level classifier combination is also tried by combining SEAV classifier with the DTW classifier. The SEAV is computationally less expensive when compared to DTW or the GMM based classifiers while performing better than the DTW technique. Several new possibilities in automatic bird call identification using SEAV are also listed. 1...|$|R
5|$|The {{classification}} <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> is {{a contentious}} issue. Sibley and Ahlquist's Phylogeny and Classification <b>of</b> <b>Birds</b> (1990) is a landmark {{work on the}} classification <b>of</b> <b>birds,</b> although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate, but scientists disagree about {{the relationships between the}} orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem, but no strong consensus has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.|$|E

40|$|Indonesia {{is rich in}} bird diversity. But {{the species}} {{richness}} <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> is threatened by illegal trapping {{and the destruction of}} habitat.

5|$|About 17.8 percent——of {{the total}} forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which {{disrupted}} the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover, {{and loss of}} seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas. Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as bamboo and cogon grass), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal-species diversity was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> and five species of mammals in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> and 30 and 55 species of mammals.|$|E

40|$|Nearly 20 % <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> {{species are}} migratory, their {{seasonal}} movements causing a redistribution <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> diversity that radically changes avian community composition worldwide. And yet, bird migration {{has been largely}} ignored in studies of global avian biodiversity. My thesis is the first global macroecological analysis <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> migration. Using a dataset on the geographical distributions <b>of</b> the world’s <b>birds,</b> I mapped global patterns <b>of</b> migratory <b>bird</b> diversity, revealing strong spatial features. I then used these patterns to test hypotheses exploring the ecological processes driving bird distributions in space and time. From these results, I developed the first mechanistic, process-based model <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> migration at the global scale. From first principles – converting key ecological processes into a common currency of energy – this model successfully explains the global patterns previously described. My research provides a better understanding <b>of</b> why <b>birds</b> migrate and opens new research avenues on this remarkable phenomenon.  </p...|$|R
