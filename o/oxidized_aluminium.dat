Since oxygen and silicon were the most common metals (using the astrochemical definition as anything other than hydrogen or helium) in the debris from supernova dust which formed the protoplanetary disk in the formation and evolution of the Solar System, they formed many complex silicates which accreted into larger rocky planetesimals that formed the terrestrial planets.

The adsorption energy varies weakly at the different adsorption sites and as a function of the oxygen coverage. For the alumina surface, we find no benzene adsorption at all.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the signal due to light beam induced current (LBIC) at the remote {{contacts}} is verified as a lateral photovoltage for non-uniformly illuminated planar p-n junction devices; simulation and experimental results are presented. The limitations imposed by the ohmic contacts are successfully overcome {{by the introduction of}} capacitively coupled remote contacts, which yield similar results without any significant loss in the estimated material and device parameters. It is observed that the LBIC measurements introduce artefacts such as shift in peak position with increasing laser power. Simulation of LBIC signal as a function of characteristic length L-c of photo-generated carriers and for different beam diameters has resulted in the observed peak shifts, thus attributed to the finite size of the beam. Further, the idea of capacitively coupled contacts has been extended to contactless measurements using pressure contacts with an <b>oxidized</b> <b>aluminium</b> electrodes. This technique avoids the contagious sample processing steps, which may introduce unintentional defects and contaminants into the material and devices under observation.

The oxidation mechanisms of spherical aluminium microparticles of an average particle size of 3. 5 mu m were studied.

25|$|Some common metals oxidize {{extremely}} {{rapidly in}} air. Titanium and <b>aluminium</b> <b>oxidize</b> instantaneously {{in contact with}} the oxygen in the air.

These metals are used in applications where corrosion resistance is important. Iron, in contrast, has an oxide that forms in air and water, called rust, that does not bond with the iron and therefore does not stop the further oxidation of the iron.

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with the mechanism of growth of porous anodic films formed on high purity aluminium and sputtering deposited aluminium over a wide range of current density between 5 to 50 mA/cm 2 for times up to 5400 s in 24. 5 wt % sulphuric acid and at temperatures of either 0 or 20 0 C. The resultant films were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), optical interferometery, microhardness and nanoindentation. The RBS analysis enabled determination of the composition of the porous films, which was expressed as Al 2 O 3. xAl 2 (SO 4) 3, with the sulphur species content increasing with increase in current density and decrease in temperature. The average expansion factor (expressing, the ratio of the film thickness to the <b>oxidized</b> <b>aluminium</b> thickness) increased between 5 mA/cm 2 and 50 mA/cm 2 for films formed at 0 0 C, extending from 1. 58 to 1. 88 and from 1. 57 to 1. 78 according to SEM and TEM respectively. For films fabricated at 20 0 C, the average expansion factor increased from 1. 45 to 1. 66 and from 1. 42 to 1. 67 derived from SEM and TEM respectively. The expansion factor increases as the current density increases for both temperatures, and decreases as electrolyte temperature for a given current density increases. The increase of expansion factor is also associated with a rise in the steady voltage during film growth. However, the film expansion does not depend on the anodizing time. The increase in expansion factor correlates with a small increase in the amount of sulphur in the film, which increases with rise of current density. The surface of the porous alumina revealed a network of furrows and ridges, reflecting the pattern of the cellular textures on the topography of the elecropolished aluminium. The retention of topography indicates that the thinning of the film due to chemical dissolution by the electrolyte is negligible, although softening of the film toward the film surface increases with rise of electrolyte temperature and anodizing time as determined by microhardness measurements on film cross-sections. For films fabricated at 0 0 C, nodules appeared with a low population density on the film surfaces formed at 20 mA/cm 2 for 5400 s, and a locally high population density, but non-uniform distribution, for films formed at 30 to 50 mA/cm 2 {{for a wide range of}} anodizing times. NRA determined the oxygen concentrations in the films, from which the efficiency of the film grown was derived. The efficiency showed a correlation with the expansion factor, with values increasing with rise of current density and with decrease in the anodizing temperature, ranging from 72 % to 87 % between 5 mA/cm 2 and 50 mA/cm 2, for an electrolyte temperature of 0 0 C, and between 66 % to 75 %, for the same range of current density, for an electrolyte temperature of 20 0 C. The change in the relative film thickness with a change of the anodizing conditions might due to either a rise in the film porosity under a constant efficiency of film growth (assuming a flow model) or an increase in the efficiency of film growth for a constant film porosity (for either a flow or dissolution model), or a combination of the two factors. However, the film expansion appeared to be relatively little dependent on the change of the porosity over selected anodizing conditions. The dependence of the efficiency on the anodizing conditions is possibly associated with a change in the transport number of ion species in the film with a reducing contribution of cation migration to the total ionic current with an increase in the current density and in decrease of the anodizing temperature, which correspond to conditions of increasing electric field. The film porosity probably develops by flow of film material underneath the pore base toward the cell wall, as indicated by distribution of tungsten band through the film and distribution of electrolyte species from previous work, with the displaced material enhancing the thickness of the film.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new gallium nitride (GaN) based transistor technology for electronic switching applications. Conventional GaN based transistors {{are of the}} high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) type and are depletion mode devices. These are not suitable for switching applications since an extra DC supply is required to bias the device in the cut-off (off-state) region and the devices are not fail-safe, i. e. incase of malfunction a short-circuit can exist between the main DC supply and ground. Enhancement mode (E-Mode) or normally-off devices can overcome these limitations and if realized in the GaN material system would benefit from the good material properties that support large breakdown voltages and low On-resistances. Fabrication of high performace E-mode GaN devices with low On-resistance and high breakdown voltage still remains a big challenge to date. In this thesis a new method for realizing enhancement mode aluminium gallium nitride - gallium nitride (AlGaN/GaN) devices using a localized gate-foot oxidation has been described. Thermal oxidation of the AlGaN barrier layer converts the top surface/part of this layer into aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3) and gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3), which serve as a good gate dielectric and improve the gate leakage current by several orders of magnitude compared to a Schottky gate. The oxidation process leaves a thinner AlGaN barrier which can result in normally o§ operation. Without special precaution, however, the oxidation of the AlGaN barrier is not uniform from the top but occurs at higher rates at the defect/dislocation sites. This {{makes it impossible to}} control the barrier thickness and so rendering the barrier useless. To avoid the problem of non-uniform oxidation, a thin layer of aluminum is first deposited on the barrier layer and <b>oxidized</b> to form <b>aluminium</b> oxide on top. This additional oxide layer seems to ensure uniform oxidation of the AlGaN barrier layer underneath on subsequent further oxidation. Results of the fabricated 2 um x 100 um AlGaN/GaN MOS-HEMTs with a partially oxidized barrier layer showed a threshold voltage of - 0. 5 V (compared to - 3 V for a Schottky devive fabricated on the same epilayer structure) and a maximum drain current of 800 mA/mm at high gate bias of 5 V with very little current compression. The peak extrinsic transconductance of the device is 160 mS/mm at a drain-source voltage of 10 V with a very low specific On-resistance of 9 : 8 ohm. mm 2 and an off-state breakdown voltage higher than 42 V. Capacitance-Voltage (C-V) measurements of Al 2 O 3 /AlGaN /GaN circular test metal-oxide-semiconductor structures were observed and measured. They exhibit no hysteresis, indicating the good quality of the thermally grown aluminium oxide for realizing AlGaN/GaN based E-Mode devices for high frequency and high power applications...|$|R
