There were often long silences. These might be broken, not by a grave suggestion as to further text, but by some wild burst of laughter. Much of the matter {{we were dealing with}} was most grim and tense. Laughter - and some schoolboyish joking - helped." ...|$|E

Then we’d start again and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> be one {{character}} and one would be another character. We'd read our lines of dialogue and the whole idea was to try to stump the other people, {{to see if they could}} think of something crazier than you could." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Supposing," [...] Rees suggested, [...] "we were induced to knuckle under, {{to become}} the victims of your damned blackmailing scheme, surely then <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> {{be allowed to go}} down to the City on parole, eh?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Alton's {{face was}} very grim. [...] "Well," [...] he said dryly, [...] "it means {{a good deal}} less to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> than it <b>would</b> have done a few weeks ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did not guess," [...] she asked, [...] "that {{it was my}} lips {{alone and}} not my heart that denied you? O-Tar had ordered that I die, more because I was a {{companion}} of Ghek than because of any evidence against me, and so I knew that if I acknowledged you as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> you <b>would</b> be slain, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are all faithful," [...] said Tristan l'Hermite gruffly; [...] "for {{should they}} {{put to death}} your Majesty, there is not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> whom they <b>would</b> suffer to survive you, even if we would." ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Clapperclaw {{says that}} we are all so charmingly {{contented}} with ourselves that not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> change with his neighbor; and so, rich and poor, high and low, one person is about as happy as another in Our Street.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall have}} to swim for it, lads," [...] Bob said as he {{shielded}} his face from the intense heat with his hat. [...] "The raft is loaded so deep that the weight of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> swamp her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's sense, any way," [...] {{said one}} of the men. [...] "I guess if he was playing any trick, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> be quite enough to get even with him. You'll take Truscott with you, Muller, and get out the bob-sled." ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{promised the}} police and court {{officials}} {{that we would not}} be violent in any way. And court officials, in turn, graciously agreed to waive the marriage license fee, since we all knew they would reject our attempts to get married. I remember it was a beautiful day, and a joyful one: We all smiled ear-to-ear knowing we were attempting something that was then impossible but which every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> thought <b>would</b> eventually become possible.|$|R
60|$|After {{the old man}} had thus spoken {{there was}} not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who <b>would</b> have ventured to object, for he had shown that in any {{business}} of this kind he knew more than all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> put together, therefore we made ready to set out; but before the first step had been taken we saw coming toward us from the direction of Bladensburg, a man riding a mule, and waving his arms as if to attract our attention.|$|R
60|$|The strange gentleman, {{with an air}} of {{authority}} not to be disputed, and with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> that <b>would</b> effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose it, left the back of the settle, and came into the space between the two settles, in front of the fire, where he remained standing, his left hand in his pocket, and he biting the forefinger of his right.|$|R

6000|$|... "You'll not do {{anything}} of the kind, lad, for we have done only our duty. I'm hoping every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> have worked just as eagerly had the prisoner been a stranger, for we who count on aiding the Cause must reckon everyone who loves it, as a friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{she ought}} to make a will," [...] said Miss Cushing. [...] "That's the long and short of it; and {{she ought to}} have a friend who would tell her so.

"You have a brave record, indeed," [...] Siegbert {{said when}} he had finished, [...] "for one so young; and fond as are our youths of {{adventure}} there is not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them of your age who has accomplished a tithe {{of what you have}} done. Why, Freda, if this youth were but <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> he <b>would</b> have the hearts of all the Norse maidens at his feet. In the eyes of a Danish girl, as of a Dane, valour is the highest of recommendations." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} static quantum {{potential}} for a theory of anti-symmetric tensor fields that results from the condensation of topological defects, {{within the framework of}} the gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables formalism.

'By Jove!' {{said the}} chairman, {{whispering}} {{across the table}} to Mr. Pickwick, 'you have hit upon something that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> at least, <b>would</b> talk upon for ever. You'll draw old Jack Bamber out; he was never heard to talk about anything else but the inns, and he has lived alone in them till he's half crazy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Steam launch, coming!” <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> cry out, on {{sighting}} {{the enemy}} in the distance; and, in an instant, everything was got ready to receive her. I would take the lines, and Harris and George would sit down beside me, all of us with our backs to the launch, and the boat would drift out quietly into mid-stream.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks {{for your}} aid, my friends!" [...] {{he said as}} they crowded round him; [...] "never was a shout more welcome than yours. You were just in time, as you may see {{by looking at the}} roof.

6000|$|... "They {{ran from}} tree to tree and had us at a {{disadvantage}} from the very start. I should have been shot dead if I hadn't got behind one of the horses.

6000|$|... "Most {{people would}} think that the one-sidedness was all the other way," [...] D'Estournel laughed. [...] "Well, men, you have all done your duty to your lady right well this night, and there is not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> here who <b>would</b> not gladly have such brave fellows in his service.

5000|$|On July 22, President Barack Obama {{said about}} the incident, [...] "I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played in that. But I think it's fair to say, number <b>one,</b> any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> be pretty angry; number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting {{somebody}} when there was already proof {{that they were in}} their own home, and, number three, what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there's a long history in this country of African Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately." [...] Law enforcement organizations and members objected to Obama's comments and criticized his handling of the issue. In the aftermath, Obama stated that he regretted his comments and hoped that the situation could become a [...] "teachable moment".|$|R
40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] nonequilibrium absorption of longitudinal-optical phonons by hot electrons are suited in terahertz quantum cascade structures. We present a method for including electron leakage to the continuum that {{take into account the}} mobility of the electrons. This is incorporated into a density matrix Monte Carlo method that includes to optical field within the resonant cavity. The effects of electron leakage to the continuum as a function of lattice temperature are discussed. Results are compared with the experiment and found to be consistent. It is shown that using only confined wave function and thereby neglecting the leakage via tunneling is inadequate for describing the electron transport.
