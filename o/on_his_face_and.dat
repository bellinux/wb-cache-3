5|$|I {{examined}} Mr. Andrew Wilson on Feb. 15 & 16, 1982. He {{had multiple}} bruises, swellings and abrasions <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> head. His right eye was battered {{and had a}} superficial laceration. Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival at the Jail. There must be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.|$|E
5|$|Cameron {{wanted his}} pitch for Daly to {{finalize}} {{the deal and}} had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator. Henriksen, wearing a leather jacket, fake cuts <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> gold foil on his teeth, kicked {{open the door to}} the office and then sat in a chair. Cameron arrived shortly after which relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron's sketches and passion for the film. In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion. The Terminator was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million. Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions and Cinema '84 have been credited as production companies after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|His family {{returns to}} Epcot, where {{the tension between}} Jim and Emily comes to a head after a drunk Jim vomits while on the Gran Fiesta Tour. Spotting the French girls, Emily argues with Jim about his obvious {{interest}} in them and slaps Sara. Embarrassed, she returns to the hotel with Elliot, leaving Jim and Sara to ride on the Soarin' attraction at Spaceship Earth, where Jim imagines a beautiful topless woman superimposed over the ride's video footage of landscapes, who promises they will be together soon. After the ride, Sophie approaches and invites Jim to come with them. When Jim refuses, Sophie spits <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> she walks off, Jim notices that Sara disappeared and searches frantically for her, but the park guards use a taser to knock him unconscious.|$|E
60|$|He {{was such}} a 'orrible figure, with the blood <b>on</b> <b>'is</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>'is</b> beard {{sticking}} out all ways, that Bob, instead of doing wot he 'ad come round for, {{stood in the doorway}} staring at 'im without a word.|$|R

5|$|Icke visited Shine four times. During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> Shine told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} stage, the riders fell {{after only a}} few kilometres. Lipman broke a finger, and became the first rider to abandon this Tour. Around 100km in the race, Lucien Pothier lost ten minutes to the main group, led by Maurice Garin, because of a broken bicycle. In Cosne, at 174km, Pothier had reached the leading group. Aucouturier had lost more than one hour at that point. Just before the next control post in Nevers, Aucouturier fell <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> {{continued}} the race covered in blood. In {{the last part of the}} race, Maurice Garin and Lucien Pothier rode away from the others. They were attacked by four masked men in a car, but still finished as the first two, with Garin beating Pothier by 50m. The many flat tires and crashes of Aucouturier, seemingly the results of sabotage, gave him a time loss of several hours.|$|E
5|$|Light Yagami, {{the true}} {{identity}} of Kira, discovers {{the location of}} Mello's hideout. An indirect result {{of this is that}} Mello meets the Shinigami Sidoh, the original owner of Mello's Death Note. Sidoh reveals to him—in exchange for some of Mello's chocolate—that there are two extra fake rules (in addition to a number of real ones specified to each Death Note's owner). Mello begins to theorize that whoever Kira is, he probably used these spurious rules to fool the Japanese police into thinking he is innocent. However, Light launches a SWAT team led by Soichiro to raid the hideout. In order to escape, Mello detonates remote-controlled explosives, after one of his Mafia accomplices fatally wounds Soichiro. Mello is left with a scar <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> the failure of his Mafia scheme leaves his real name in Light's hands.|$|E

5|$|When Professor Crater arrives, he is {{reluctant}} to be examined, telling Kirk that they only require salt tablets. Before McCoy can complete the examination, they hear a scream from outside. They find Darnell dead, with red ring-like mottling <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> a plant root visible in his mouth; Nancy says that {{she was unable to}} stop Darnell from tasting the plant. On board Enterprise, Spock (Leonard Nimoy) analyzes the plant. He confirms that it is poisonous, but the mottling is not a symptom. McCoy conducts a medical exam, and together with Spock determines that Darnell died after all the salt was drained from his body. In response, Kirk transports back down to the planet with McCoy and two crewmen, Green (Bruce Watson) and Sturgeon (John Arndt). They spread out to search, but Crater slips away. Kirk and McCoy find Sturgeon's body. Meanwhile, unseen by them, Nancy has killed Green; the faces of Green and Sturgeon show the same mottling as Darnell. Nancy alters her shape, assuming the form of Green, and meets Kirk and McCoy. They beam back up to the ship with Sturgeon's body.|$|E
5|$|Yusef {{encourages}} Zainab and Masood's estranged son Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) to {{take the}} first step in making amends as he is gay, and Syed goes to Tamwar and Afia's mangni (engagement party). The roof collapses and Syed is hospitalised and Yusef lies to Zainab that Syed could die so she visits him, but his injuries were not serious noticing that Yusef tricked her. Yusef makes out that he is sleeping with Zainab so Masood and Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) then kidnap Yusef in an attempt to scare him away. Masood threatens to pour petrol over Yusef, though it is only water and leaves him unharmed. When Masood returns home, Yusef has cuts <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> blames it on Masood. Everyone believes Yusef and Masood is rejected from his home. Yusef convinces Tamwar, Afia and Zainab that Masood should not be at the mehndi. At the wedding, Masood turns up to try to stop it but Tamwar reveals that he and Afia already married. Yusef's cousin Tariq (Antony Bunsee) arrives and he reveals that Yusef started the fire that burnt Zainab.|$|E

25|$|During the feast, Mrs. Karvel asks Jaynes {{to bring}} out more dessert, and Sausage Nose and a child follow him inside the Biodome. The child dies in a river from the rat poison, and Sausage Nose realizes the trick that is being played on the Snow Honkies. He charges at Jaynes and is killed by an ax to the head, {{courtesy}} of Garth. To avoid suspicions of Sausage Nose going missing, Jaynes forces Garth into a robe and smears toothpaste <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> hands. The Snow Honkies discover that something is amiss and that Garth is not Sausage Nose at all. The Snow Honkies begin to attack the humans when an earthquake occurs, killing all except Jaynes, Garth, and Pym.|$|E
25|$|Thorondor first {{enters the}} {{narrative}} when {{he helped the}} Elven-prince Fingon rescue his kinsman Maedhros from imprisonment upon Thangorodrim. After the Dagor Bragollach, he saved Fingolfin's body from defilement by his slayer Morgoth, giving the Dark Lord a scar <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> carrying the Elven-king's corpse to the Encircling Mountains north of Gondolin, where it was buried by Turgon. Shortly afterwards, Thorondor espied Húrin and Huor {{at the feet of}} the Mountains, and sent two of his servants to fetch them and bear them to Gondolin, fulfilling thus the intentions of the Vala Ulmo. Thorondor and two other eagles rescued Lúthien and the wounded Beren from the doors of Angband during their Quest of the Silmaril, taking them to Doriath.|$|E
25|$|In this game, Tim Tebow {{also created}} an iconic image {{of himself and}} the Gators for 2008. Because of the rainy {{conditions}} in Tallahassee that day, the field was extremely wet and slippery, affecting play on both sides. On a 4-yard TD run into the endzone, Tebow slid in on the wet turf, causing {{the front of his}} white Away jersey to get wet red paint on it. The paint also got <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> helmet and stayed on {{for the majority of the}} game. The red paint resembled blood to many people which provided Tebow with a bravado of bravery and passion, which also highlighted his intense sideline celebrations and enthusiasm. The image of Tebow's paint-stained Jersey became one of the lasting and memorable images in sports for 2008 and for the decade at large.|$|E
60|$|Ralph saw at once by {{the look}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> friend's <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> the solicitude with which he {{examined}} his horses, that Bob had told the first portion of the story, which {{had been more than}} displeasing to him.|$|R

25|$|In July and August 2012, {{protests in}} the Qatif region {{intensified}} after Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr {{was wounded in}} the leg and arrested by police on 8 July. Three men were killed in a protest on the evening of the arrest. Funerals and protests took place on 10 July, 11 July and 13 July, including chants calling for the downfall of the House of Saud. Another protestor was shot dead in the 13 July al-Awamiyah protest. While detained, al-Nimr was tortured, had bruises <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> broken teeth, and started a hunger strike. Protest organisers in al-Awamiyah stated their support for al-Nimr and insisted on the use of nonviolent resistance. Protester Mohamed al-Shakhouri was shot in the back and neck and arrested in a 26–27 July protest calling for al-Nimr's release. Further protests called for all Shia and Sunni detainees to be freed, including al-Shakhouri. A protestor and a soldier were fatally shot in Qatif during a 3–4 August evening human rights protest, leading to several more protests.|$|E
25|$|Kelly {{dominated}} the following spring. He won Paris–Nice {{for the third}} successive time beating Roche {{as well as the}} Tour de France winner, Bernard Hinault who was returning after a knee injury. Kelly finished second in Milan–San Remo and the Tour of Flanders, but was unbeatable in Paris–Roubaix and Liège–Bastogne–Liège. The day after Paris–Roubaix, the French daily sports paper, L'Équipe, pictured Kelly cycling the cobbles with mud <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> had the heading Insatiable Kelly! referring to his appetite for winning that spring He won all three stages in the Critérium International: the bunch sprint on stage 1, a solo victory in the mountain stage and beating Roche in the final time trial. Kelly achieved 33 victories in 1984. He was becoming a contender in the grand tours, as seen by finishing fifth in the Tour de France. This may have caused him to lose his grip on the points classification in that year's Tour. Kelly was wearing it as the Tour was finishing on the Champs-Élysées but lost it in the bunch finish to the Belgian, Frank Hoste, who finished ahead of Kelly gaining points to take the jersey off Kelly's shoulders.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Team" [...] was {{directed}} by Young Replicant.

He was then encouraged to give a demonstration of maximum speed, and was timed at over 40mph, when a 'sudden pallor' was seen <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> his machine wobbled to a stop, Roper falling off his cycle.

500|$|The anglicized name Isaac is a {{transliteration}} of the Hebrew term Yiṣḥāq which literally means [...] "He laughs/will laugh." [...] Ugaritic texts {{dating from}} the 13th century BCE refer to the benevolent smile of the Canaanite deity El. Genesis, however, ascribes the laughter to Isaac's parents, Abraham and Sarah, rather than El. According to the biblical narrative, Abraham fell <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> laughed when God (Hebrew, Elohim) imparted the news of their son's eventual birth. He laughed because Sarah was {{past the age of}} childbearing; both she and Abraham were advanced in age.
