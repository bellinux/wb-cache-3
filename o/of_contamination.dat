5|$|The {{trend toward}} {{artificial}} ice was hastened by the regular ice famines during the period, {{such as the}} 1898 British famine, which typically caused rapid price increases, fuelled demand for plant ice and encouraged investment in the new technologies. Concerns also grew over the safety of natural ice. Initial reports concerning ice being produced from polluted or unclean lakes and rivers had first emerged in the U.S. {{as early as the}} 1870s. The British public health authorities believed Norwegian ice was generally much purer and safer than American sourced ice, but reports in 1904 noted the risk <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> in transit and recommended moving to the use of plant ice. In 1907, New York specialists claimed ice from the Hudson River to be unsafe for consumption and potentially containing typhoid germs; the report was successfully challenged by the natural ice industry, but public opinion was turning against natural ice on safety grounds. These fears <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> was often played on by artificial ice manufacturers in their advertising. Major damage was also done to the industry by fire, including a famous blaze at the American Ice Company facilities at Iceoboro in 1910, which destroyed the buildings and the adjacent schooners, causing around $130,000 ($2,300,000 in 2010 terms) of damage and crippling the Maine ice industry.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND There is {{currently}} little evidence regarding potential risks <b>of</b> bacterial <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> non-invasive ventilation (NIV) devices used by cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. AIM The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the extent <b>of</b> bacterial <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> NIV devices in our regional adult CF centre. METHODS Seven NIV devices recently used by CF patients chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) were swabbed in seven areas, both external and internal. Two devices had undergone ethylene oxide (EtO) sterilization between patient use and swabbing, and five devices had not undergone EtO sterilization. FINDINGS Swabs from five devices had insignificant growth of environmental organisms and two devices had significant growth of environmental organisms. No CF pathogens were isolated from any machine. CONCLUSIONS No evidence was found <b>of</b> pathogenic microbial <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> NIV devices used by CF patients in this small study. We suggest that further studies examine for evidence <b>of</b> bacterial <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> NIV devices and that this issue should be included in future CF infection control guidelines...|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} known {{for more than a century}} that {{consumption}} of raw or insufficiently cooked shellfish can be associated with infectious diseases. These are caused either by bacteria naturally present in the sea such as Vibrio spp. or by viruses and bacteria from sewage effluent that sometimes contaminates coastal waters. As filter feeders, bivalves pass large quantities of water through their gills, filtering out the organic particles, including the microbial pathogens. These are retained in the animals' tissues and become concentrated in their liver-like digestive glands. Another possible source <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> occurs when bivalves contain marine biotoxins as a result of ingesting numerous dinoflagellates. These microalgae are not associated with sewage but occur unpredictably as algal blooms. Large areas of a sea or lake may change colour as a result of the proliferation of millions of single-cell algae, and this condition is known as a red tide.|$|E

5|$|Terns have {{sometimes}} benefited from human activities, following the plough or fishing boats for easy food supplies, although some birds get trapped in nets or swallow plastic. Fishermen looked for feeding tern flocks, since the birds could {{lead them to}} fish shoals. Overfishing of small fish such as sand eels can lead to steep declines in the colonies relying on these prey items. More generally, the loss or disruption to tern colonies caused by human activities has caused declines in many species. Pollution {{has been a problem}} in some areas, and in the 1960s and 1970s DDT caused egg loss through thinning of the shells. In the 1980s, organochlorides caused severe declines in the Great Lakes area of the US. Because of their sensitivity to pollutants, terns are sometimes used as indicators <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> levels.|$|E

5|$|Because it is {{a common}} estuarine fish, it has been used in studies of heavy metal {{contamination}} in coastal waters. Fish tested around Sydney showed uptake was highest in the gonads, then muscle, gills and liver. It is unclear why metal concentrations were lower in toadfish livers (compared with studies <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> in other fish) but their liver cells may be more effective at removing these elements. Lead, cadmium and nickel levels corresponded with those in the sediment from which the fish were taken, suggesting dietary intake. The gonads of male fish had twenty times as much arsenic as those of females, while the gills of female fish contained thirty times as much lead as those of males. Raised levels of arsenic, cobalt, cadmium and lead in gills suggested the fish absorbed these from the surrounding water. An experiment exposing smooth toadfish to radioactive cadmium and selenium in either food or water found that cadmium in food was taken up in and excreted by the liver, while cadmium in water was taken up in the gut lining and excreted in liver, gills and kidney, indicating the fish were consuming a lot of water. Selenium was taken up in the gills, kidneys and liver regardless of whether it was in food or water.Cd and 75Se from Water and Food by an Estuarine Fish (Tetractenos glaber) | journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.07.012| pmid=17884259}} Fieldwork in Sydney waterways showed that higher arsenic, lead, cadmium and cobalt corresponded with decreased lipid levels in liver and gonadal tissue, and raised cobalt and nickel correspond to increased protein levels in muscle, liver and gonadal tissue. Raised lead levels were consistent with smaller egg size. A study of asymmetry of fish bones in smooth toadfish in various parts of Sydney and Hawkesbury River estuaries showed a relationship between exposure to organochlorine pesticides but not heavy metals, indicating the finding may correlate to stress from organic toxicity.|$|E
