40|$|Background: Bread is {{the staple}} food of Iranian society. Attention to its health and hygiene is important. Nowadays, {{the use of}} baking soda in the {{production}} of bread has seen by most of bakers which is because of producing bread with more beautiful and appearance and is more public acceptance. Methods: In this cross-sectional study that 40 people were taken, consumer satisfaction of prepared Barbari bread using three types additives Fenugreek juice, baking soda, and tomato juice by means of questionnaires were evaluated. Results: The results of this study showed that consumer satisfaction of taste and smell (34 of 40), appearance, <b>glazing,</b> and <b>quality</b> (36 of 40) of prepared bread by tomato juice was more than Fenugreek juice and baking soda. Consumer satisfaction of taste, smell, appearance, <b>glazing,</b> <b>quality,</b> shopping satisfaction, and quality of bread over time of three types of additives (baking soda, tomato juice, and Fenugreek juice) was significant (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Tomato juice has the attributes necessary for public acceptance and satisfaction of consumers, nevertheless don’t have the complications of baking soda. So it can be a reasonable alternative for the processing of bread dough instead of baking soda...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{applicability}} of laser ablation (LA) {{inductively coupled plasma}} (ICP) spectrometry for assessing elemental distributions in layered ceramics was investigated and compared with electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). <b>Ordinary</b> <b>glazed</b> wall tiles were employed as model specimens due to their defined structure and composition. They were used for calibration {{in the analysis of}} ancient pottery. A qualitative depth profile was acquired by single-spot laser drilling perpendicular to coatings with a Nd:YAG (1064 nm) laser coupled with an ICP optical emission spectrometer (OES). The lower lateral resolution associated with the laser spot diameter of 1. 0 mm led to smoothing of the depth profile due to the averaging of local irregularities. In addition, transverse line scans by ablation across the tile section using an ArF* (193 nm) laser coupled with an ICP mass spectrometer (MS) were performed. LA-ICP-OES depth profiles and LA-ICP-MS transverse scans were validated by EPMA section scans and 2 D back-scattered electrons images. The LA-ICP-OES acquisition was less dependent on sample surface and layer irregularities, whereas the transverse line scan over the tile section with the small-spot beam offered insight into the micromorphology of the individual layer. The combined approach revealed the occurrence of individual mineral grains, micro-heterogeneities and the character of interfaces between layer...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{insulation}} solar glass (HISG) is {{a recently}} developed smart building material to minimize energy consumption of building sector. HISG might be {{presumed to be}} a conventional photovoltaic glazing product; however, it is completely unique by having some characteristic features such as superior thermal insulation, which is competitive with triple-glazed windows using argon as inert gas, acoustic and thermal comfort, self-cleaning ability owing to TiO 2 nano-coating on module surface and extraordinary energy saving potential in both summer and winter. In our previous works, comprehensive experimental and numerical works {{have been carried out}} for power generation and thermal insulation performance of HISG under various climatic conditions. Within the scope of this research, optical- and lighting-related performance parameters of this smart building material are evaluated through extensive laboratory and in situ tests. Shading coefficient, visible light intensity, and UV and IR penetration are investigated via the tests conducted in real operating conditions. It is achieved from the results that the shading coefficient of HISG is only 0. 136, which yields almost 80 % reduction in solar heat gain compared with <b>ordinary</b> <b>glazing.</b> It is also observed from the in situ tests that HISG has a % 100 UV and 99 % IR blocking rate, which is of vital importance in terms of human health and thermal comfort conditions. Glaring effects are totally resolved via HISG, which is still a challenge for the buildings with conventional glazing products, especially in summer...|$|R

40|$|The conference {{presentation}} {{will discuss}} a recent collaboration between artist printmaker Tracy Hill and ceramic researcher Dr Alasdair Bremner. The {{aim was to}} create large format 3 D relief prints that retained a print quality, yet were rendered in a durable material. The presentation will discuss the compromises and opportunities that developed from the cross-disciplinary activity. Tracy has been developing a way of translating the marks from etched metal plates and silkscreen images {{onto the surface of}} cast plaster. The direct interaction with this surface and the relationship which resulted between the oil based ink of the etched plate and the surface layer of the water based ink laid down by the silk screen, offered many potential combinations, creating a versatile and unique medium that was printed, yet retained a relief surface. The disadvantage of this process was the fragility of the resulting works. A potential solution was to translate the process into ceramic. Alasdair’s research using castable refractory concrete to create large format architectural ceramics presented a way to achieve pieces that would have the scale and durability that was required. This industrial technology offers the opportunity to achieve the creation of objects that do not conform to some of the traditional limitations of conventional clay yet can make use of a range of ceramic surface treatments. The challenge of the project was to translate the techniques that Tracy had developed for use in plaster to refractory concrete material, combining the print <b>quality</b> with ceramic <b>glaze</b> <b>qualities.</b> They will discuss the processes developed and highlight the advantages print making in refractory concrete can offer in terms of the interaction of glaze and oxide; the scales possible and finally the durability and permanency. This collaboration opens up new possibilities for printmaking beyond the conventional print within a gallery space...|$|R

40|$|As {{a ceramic}} {{material}} bone china {{is a highly}} specialised product and {{is the basis of}} the world's most attractive and expensive types of tableware, mainly due to its translucency, whiteness, bright <b>glaze,</b> decoration <b>quality,</b> and high strength. Despite numerous studies on bone china made by several authors over many years, insufficient is known even today about the chemical reactions and physical processes taking place between the various raw materials which make up the body, during biscuit firing. As a result, there is still controversy about the formation and chemistry of its constituent phases, particularly the glassy matrix phase. In this paper, part of an extended study, the biscuit firing process and the resultant microstructure of the bone china body, studied using a combination of techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), is reported. It is clearly shown that fired bone china body consists of crystals of anorthite, beta-TCP, and also a small amount of quartz, rather unevenly dispersed in a complex glassy matrix phase.

30|$|Modern office {{buildings}} often have large glazed areas. Depending on the climate zone, {{incident solar radiation}} on fenestration can lead to high cooling demands during hot periods, although solar radiation can help reduce heating demands during cool periods. Previous {{studies have shown that}} {{a large proportion of the}} net energy demand of an office building is related to window heat loss and cooling demands induced by solar irradiance. Some experts [1] found that, even in what traditionally has been considered to be a heating-dominated climate, cooling demands dominate the net energy demand of an office building. Solar shading systems are vital to reduce the cooling demand of an office building and might also be necessary to reduce glare issues. In the tropics, glazed façade is also the cause of large solar heat gains inside buildings, and researchers [2] are focusing on reducing solar heat (infrared) transmittance and daylight (visible light) transmittance. It was also observed [3] that, in the case of double glazing units (DGU), the use of a solar control film is highly recommended to increase the separation between the sheet glasses. The energy gain was reduced by 55  % compared to the traditional DGU without solar control film. Fixed shading devices (e.g. vertical fins, diagonal fins and egg crate) are used to protect inner spaces from direct solar gain through openings, windows and large glazed surfaces to control air temperature and improve the illuminance level. The results [4] showed that the temperature in offices with shading devices was reduced to an acceptable level compared to offices without shading devices. The visual environment was improved by controlling the illuminance level, improving uniformity and eliminating glare. Other researchers [5] recommend accurately estimating the optical properties of the different types of dynamic shading devices (such as roller blinds and Venetian blinds) and including their effects in the glazing system analysis. The Venetian blind is an interesting solution because it blocks direct solar radiation, whilst enabling the transmission of diffuse radiation indoors. Further progress is inextricable linked to the dynamic control of sunlight and optimal control of solar heat gains, taking into account the variability in the solar radiation spectra incident on the building’s envelope and the variability in outdoor and indoor air temperature differences. Tuning control [6] of glazing’s transmittance dependence on the solar radiation wavelength is required to optimise daylighting with reference to people’s needs (their health and comfort) and energy (thermal and electrical load minimization). However, the energy-saving potential of regulating solar spectrum response properties is greater than that of regulating the long-wave thermal emission property in summer; the trend is reversed in winter [7]. By properly regulating the NIR spectrum transmission and reflection properties and the long-wave thermal emission property, the performance of <b>ordinary</b> <b>glazing</b> can be improved to approach the perfect window for summer or winter. An advanced fenestration system must combine the functions of daylighting regulation, glare protection and seasonal thermal control.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the requirements for}} passive school buildings, simplified calculation methods based on EN ISO 13790 are used. For these simplified calculations a fixed indoor temperature is used regardless the building properties, the climatic data or the building use data. Considering the large impact of this temperature on the heating demand, an accurate estimation is important to obtain representative results. This paper analyses {{the accuracy of the}} fixed indoor temperature. Multiple dynamic simulations of a reference school building varying the thermal inertia, the insulation <b>qualities,</b> <b>glazing</b> properties and shading are performed to indicate the effect on the indoor temperature. The results show a rather limited impact of the thermal inertia. On the other hand, a more accurate definition of the fixed indoor temperatures based on the function and use of the rooms is important to obtain better results...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed to {{investigate}} the energy and thermal performances of the airport passenger terminal buildings in Sri Lanka that use different glazing alternatives. In this regard, one of the passenger terminal buildings at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) {{was selected as the}} reference case. Different glazing materials commercially available both in the local and overseas market were compared with a common glass material used in Sri Lanka as the base case {{to investigate the}} energy use and the thermal comfort conditions in the building. The computer software tool, DEROB-LTH (version 99. 02) was used to evaluate the cooling energy use and thermal environment condition of the building. The cooling energy use was evaluated in terms of hourly, daily and monthly basis and the interior climate was evaluated in terms of the operative temperature. The simulation results have shown a positive conclusion towards the feasibility of using double glazing units with advanced solar-control coatings and it further showed that the common glazing material used in the Sri Lankan building industry; the single-clear glazing is not feasible in terms of energy cost and indoor thermal performances. The study also supports that a single-pane heat-absorbing type solar-control configuration can give comparatively moderate results; better results than that for the single-clear glazing type in local climatic conditions. Finally, an economic/cost-benefit analysis was performed in order to investigate the economic viability of applying the best performing, highly expensive, advanced solar-control glazing over the reference case; <b>ordinary</b> single-clear <b>glazing,</b> and it was found that this glazing is highly cost effective and worth paying for any orientation. However, it is noted that the initial capital cost of these advanced solar-control glass materials as well as the popularisation of this technology in the local scenario was identified as the major barrier for the development of this technology in Sri Lanka...|$|R
40|$|According to the Czech {{legislative}} act the operative temperature is the evaluation criterion for thermal comfort in air-conditioned or heated spaces. The operative temperature respects the air temperature; {{mean radiant temperature}} and air velocity. For mean radiant temperature calculation the surface temperature of the surrounding walls must be known. Manual calculation of the mean radiant temperature is very complicated and not suitable for practical usage since the surface temperatures are difficult to determine. On the contrary, the computer-based calculation is prepared to do this automatically and could be particularly useful when seeking multiple solutions for a problem under the optional conditions. The paper presents the operative temperature analysis in a space, using the dynamic simulation method, respecting the inside and outside climatic changing effect. Three typical rooms were chosen for the analysis: a single façade room, a corner room and a room under the roof. The rooms were analysed in a light of external wall mass, <b>glazing</b> ratio and <b>quality.</b> Three façade types {{were used in the}} model.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{designed}} to make a generalized study of the ceramics present in the Western Indian Ocean during the period 1250 AD- 1550 AD, the period of expansion of the Hormuzi trading empire and its associated site of Julfar. The first part presents {{an analysis of the}} recently excavated assemblage from Julfar al-Nudud and then sets out to contextualize this within the wider Indian Ocean. Bringing in the available data from important trading sites in Arabia, southern Iran and East Africa, the work demonstrates a series of generalized assemblages based on period and geographical location, along with identifying a ‘ceramic trading’ assemblage for the study area. This puts forward that certain wares, generally Gulf and Chinese high- <b>quality</b> <b>glazed</b> wares are likely to be found on most sites involved in trade during this time, although not necessarily in great quantities. Other unglazed Iranian and Arabian storage wares, presumably traded for their contents rather than the vessel itself are found in greater quantities but individual wares vary between sites. The study finally identifies the areas where data is currently insufficient and suggests important future research questions for the study area...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} conducted by the author in the years 2007 - 2010 in the castle of the Kraków bishops in Muszyna produced 13 fragments of decorated stoneware vessels originating from no less than 10 specimens, designed for drinking wine (?). The vessels had either one or both surfaces coated with light-green or dark-brown <b>glaze</b> of excellent <b>quality.</b> By analogy to similar finds from the royal castle in Buda, most {{of them seem to}} represent beakers with funnel-like flaring walls decorated on the entire or at least most of the outer surface with diagonal bands executed with a roulette, lines of single stamp imprints, or plastic motifs in the form of small knobs. Some of the fragments belonged to more sophisticated forms. Two originated from a vessel (or vessels) with a highly rounded body, decorated with conical knobs which, however, were considerably larger and more loosely spaced than those described above. Another three fragments came from a pedestalled beaker, or perhaps a beaker with a separated foot. The vessel had thin wall covered on both sides with highly decorative glaze light-green in colour with a brownish tinge. The impression is emphasised by single dark knobs with granulated surfaces resembling blackberry fruits attached at or near the level of narrow bands of dark-brown glaze running around the vessel body. Most of the fragments described above find no direct analogies in the stoneware finds from Poland, which represent either the Rhine workshops or {{what is known as the}} Falke group. A connection with the latter can only be indicated in the case of the forms decorated with knobs. The fragment with leaf-like imprints most likely originates from a Celje type beaker - a vessel type manufactured in Carinthia during the 15 th century - while the largest group of sherds, whose ornamentation was executed with a roulette, are probably the work of Moravian workshops, although variants identical with the Muszyna finds have not been confirmed there. As regards the vessel decorated with “blackberry fruits” no analogy has yet been found. Several possible interpretations can be proposed: the vessel could either be a German import, the product of Moravian workshops, or a unique product of the workshops which operated in Buda during the time of Matthias Corvinus and which produced exquisite pottery (including maiolica) for the royal court. The pottery fragments in question were discovered in the deposits pre-dating the Hungarian siege of 1474 as well as in those chronologically corresponding to it, from where the most spectacular fragments were recovered. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that they found their way to Muszyna with Hungarian troops that, probably being commanded by King Matthias Corvinus himself, captured the castle in January 1474. In the light of this assumption, there is a distinct possibility that the discussed vessels may have been used by the king himself...|$|R
