5|$|An {{independent}} film remake of Caligari edited, {{written and directed}} by David Lee Fisher was released in 2005, in which new actors were placed in front of the actual backdrops from the original film. The actors performed in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>green</b> screen, then their performances were superimposed in front of matte shots based on the original sets. Doug Jones played the role of Cesare.|$|E
5|$|For the WB's 2004–2005 {{prime time}} schedule, Carey co-produced {{and starred in}} Drew Carey's Green Screen Show, a {{spin-off}} of Whose Line Is It Anyway?. It was canceled by the WB, but picked up shortly afterward by Comedy Central. The show's premise relied on the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>green</b> screen {{for all of the}} actors' improv interactions. Animation on the screen was inserted during post-production.|$|E
5|$|Loring {{was also}} home to an administrations support base <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Green</b> Pine {{communications}} crew from Naval Station Argentia.

5|$|The Flag of Bangladesh has a {{green field}} {{based on a}} similar flag used during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. It {{consists}} of a red disc on top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>green</b> field. The red disc represents the sun rising over Bengal, and also the blood {{of those who died}} for the independence of Bangladesh. The green field stands for the lushness of the land of Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|Hahn {{recalled}} {{some difficulty}} in finding someone {{to host the}} film, so the studio decided to use a group of artists and musicians from various fields of entertainment. The interstitials were filmed in various locations; the orchestra, Jones, Lansbury, and Bronfman were shot in Los Angeles, Perlman and Middler in New York City, and others in Boston, Massachusetts. Each scene was filmed in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>green</b> screen to allow shots of the orchestra or the set to be placed behind them. The shots of Levine, the artists, and the orchestra were filmed on October 31, 1998. The piano Grierson plays in his scene with Jones {{is the same one}} on which he played Rhapsody in Blue for the soundtrack.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{director}} Martin Campbell {{confirmed the}} possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Green</b> Lantern trilogy. Warner Bros. originally planned on Green Lantern {{being the first}} entry of a new DC film franchise, and commissioned a script for a sequel from Greg Berlanti, Michael Green, and Marc Guggenheim while filming for the first film was underway. In August 2010, Michael Goldenberg was still attached to write the screenplay, based on the sequel treatment. The scene in the film's end credits showing a resurgence of the yellow power ring of fear, with Sinestro becoming corrupted by its dark power, teased the planned sequel. In September 2011 Warner Bros., dismayed by the film's negative reviews and disappointing box office return, abandoned plans for sequels.|$|E
5|$|Prime Television {{became a}} network in November 1988, with a shared logo {{produced}} and used across the regional stations, featuring the word Prime Television above an outlined rectangle. Aggregation occurred across the network on 31 December 1989, {{along with the}} introduction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>green</b> logo featuring the word Prime with the letter i dotted with a globe. This logo was used across the network until 1991, when a new gold circular logo was introduced. Following a decade in use, 2001 saw the launch of a new simplified yellow logo, with {{the removal of the}} circle. This logo was launched concurrently with a similarly design logo on the Golden West Network. Following the 2011 relaunch, a new red logo was introduced which incorporates the Seven Network logo.|$|E
5|$|The Laserex P90 laser {{systems have}} a weight of 131 g (0.29lb), {{and they are}} {{activated}} by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>green</b> pressure switch located {{on the underside of}} the weapon's pistol grip. The lasers can be configured for three different internal settings: Off– disabled to prevent accidental activation, Training– low intensity for eye safety and extended battery life in training, or Combat– high intensity for maximum visibility. The Laserex P90 laser systems have a battery life of 250 hours when used on the Training setting, or a life of 50 hours when used on the Combat setting.|$|E

5|$|The death scenes {{required}} {{varying degrees}} of 2D and 3D graphic enhancement, with the roller coaster scene alone being composed of 144 visual-effect shots. Custom-designed coaster cars were created and modified, based on events in the script. Most of the model was hand-built, with MEL scripts aiding specific elements. The coaster-crash scenes were filmed with the actors performing in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>green</b> screen with a CGI background. Several of the roller coaster's cars were suspended with bungee cords to film the crash, and the deaths required CGI onscreen effects; each actor had a corresponding CGI double.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Mulder and Doggett agree to jump from the oil platform, which was shot {{in a way that}} recalls a scene in the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, was filmed by having Patrick and Duchovny jump in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>green</b> screen. Separate footage of the rig exploding—created by {{combining}} actual shots of the rig with CGI—was then filmed, and the two shots were composited on top of one another.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} The Saline Project and was shot in Puerto Rico and Jamaica. The Puerto Rico scenes were shot a day after Stefani's concert in the city, as part of The Sweet Escape Tour, on July 19, 2007. Many parts of the video were shot in a studio, including scenes of Stefani riding a motorcycle in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>green</b> screen. The video premiered on MTV's Total Request Live on September 4, 2007.|$|E

5|$|For {{slow motion}} scenes like with bullets and drops of water, twin Phantom {{high-speed}} cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot-by-shot {{for the film}} and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} use existing equipment such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>green</b> screen. A 1983 Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.|$|E
5|$|Gillard {{was first}} elected to the House of Representatives at the 1998 federal {{election}} for the seat of Lalor. Following the 2001 election, she was elected to Shadow Cabinet. When Kevin Rudd was elected as party leader and Leader of the Opposition in December 2006, Gillard was elected unopposed as his deputy. Upon Labor's victory at the 2007 election, {{she became the first}} female Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, and was made Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. On , after Rudd lost the support of his party and resigned, Gillard was elected unopposed as his replacement, thus becoming prime minister. The subsequent 2010 federal election saw the first hung parliament since 1940. Gillard was able to form a minority government with the support <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Green</b> MP and three independents. On 26 June 2013, after a leadership spill, Gillard lost the leadership of the Labor Party back to Rudd. Her resignation as prime minister took effect the following day. Gillard retired from politics on 5 August 2013, before the impending federal election.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{wrote to}} Spargo on September 18, stating that his {{commission}} had approved {{the head of}} Allen but was dissatisfied with the lettering. Spargo had mentioned that President Coolidge liked the Bennington Monument, and Moore stated that the Fine Arts Commission was anxious to get right a coin for the president's state of birth; Fry, he wrote, had the talent to design a handsome coin, but had not done so. The next day, Spargo replied, hopeful that they would soon resolve the dispute. He stated that the Sesquicentennial Commission felt that designs other than the monument would not do; for example, the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Green</b> Mountain Boy would both require stretching history and risk charges of imitating the Minuteman seen on the Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollar, issued earlier in 1925. He was also unwilling to have a two-headed coin, as such a design combined with the depiction of Allen would be. Spargo suggested that Moore put his objections in writing and be as clear as possible to induce Fry {{to continue with the}} project, because the sculptor wanted to withdraw from it. Despite conciliatory efforts, Fry refused to continue, and after the failure of brief negotiations with Theodore Spicer-Simson, the Vermont commission engaged Charles Keck.|$|E

5|$|This mamba preys {{primarily}} on adult birds, eggs and rodents. This species {{has also been}} documented to prey on bats. It is also believed that this species eats arboreal lizards as well, but {{this has not been}} documented. The preliminary evidence suggests that this species displays a sit-and-wait strategy of foraging. However, this evidence does not preclude active foraging by this species. One witness observed a specimen systematically hunt sleeping bats (J. Ashe, pers. comm. 1991). They have also been known to raid the nests of young birds. Sit-and-wait tactics may be successful with highly mobile prey, such as adult birds or rodents. Documented prey include the sombre greenbul, which occur in dense portions of natural and cultivated vegetation along Kenya's coastline. Ionides and Pitman (1965) reported a large Bushveld gerbil in the stomach <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>green</b> mamba in Tanzania. Although the Bushveld gerbil does not occur in Kenya, green mambas will prey on any of the seven species of gerbil that inhabit various portions of its range.|$|E
5|$|When {{considering}} his appearance for Soulcalibur, different designs were considered, including {{one with a}} heavily bandaged eye and scarred appearance intended to imply his fate {{at the end of}} Soul Edge, and another modeled after his appearance in Soul Edges opening sequence, featuring a wide-brimmed hat, though both designs were rejected as the developers felt they made the character appear too thin. Elements from both were reused for Soulcalibur III, retaining the hat while giving his left eye a damaged appearance. Elements of his previous design were retained, with the addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>green</b> vest and bracers, and the lengthening of the tail of his coat to his mid-thighs. His alternate character model from Soul Edge was added as his alternate in the game, featuring minimal changes save for opening the vest to have his chest be bare.|$|E
5|$|While {{the local}} townspeople believe all Carno's wives {{died of natural}} causes or accidentally, Adrienne learns through a series of visions that he murdered them in {{grotesque}} ways. Hortencia (Christine Armond), who avoided Zoltan's abuse by secluding herself in her greenhouse, is stabbed with gardening tools and suffocated with mulch. Victoria (Holley Chant), an alcoholic, is killed when Zoltan impales her eye with a wine bottle during an argument. An overly talkative third wife, Leonora (Dana Moody), has her mouth gagged and her neck contorted in a torture device. Finally, the food-loving Regina (Wanda Smith) is force-fed animal entrails through a funnel until she chokes to death. Harriet performs a séance for Adrienne, revealing in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>green</b> ectoplasm the spirit of Carno before he had been possessed. He reveals that the previously contained evil spirit has been released, and urges Adrienne to trap it once again.|$|E
