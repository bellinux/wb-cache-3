5|$|However, the {{aftermath}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> {{is not always}} easily erased, {{as many of the}} economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, {{changes in}} {{political}} leadership {{on both sides}} shifted the dynamic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War.</b> Dwight D. Eisenhower was inaugurated president that January.

5|$|More broadly, one {{hallmark}} of the 1950s {{was the beginning of}} European integration—a fundamental by-product <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> that Truman and Eisenhower promoted politically, economically, and militarily, but which later administrations viewed ambivalently, fearful that an independent Europe would forge a separate détente with the Soviet Union, which would use this to exacerbate Western disunity.|$|E

50|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War's</b> ideological contest, and <b>the</b> interference <b>of</b> some global powers, Cambodia {{found itself}} in an insecure environment.

In reality KPRAF still dominated three factions of resistance groups. KPRAF integrated the Khmer Rough surrendering troops, KPNLF, ANKI and continue to dominated these groups even after integrations.|$|R
