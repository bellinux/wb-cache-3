40|$|To verify {{real-time}} {{properties of}} UML statecharts one may apply a UPPAAL, toolbox for model checking of real-time systems. One {{of the most}} suitable ways to specify an operational semantics of UML statecharts is to invoke the formal model <b>of</b> Hierarchical <b>Timed</b> Automata. Since the model language of UPPAAL is based on Networks <b>of</b> <b>Timed</b> Automata one has to provide a conversion <b>of</b> Hierarchical <b>Timed</b> Automata to Networks <b>of</b> <b>Timed</b> Automata. In this paper we describe this conversion algorithm and prove that it is correct w. r. t. UPPAAL query language {{which is based on}} the subset <b>of</b> <b>Timed</b> CTL. </p...|$|R

5|$|Action Button Entertainment is a {{video game}} {{development}} studio consisting <b>of</b> <b>Tim</b> Rogers, Brent Porter, Michael Kerwin, and Nicholas Wasilewski that has produced five games: Ziggurat (2012), TNNS (2013), Ten by Eight (2013), Tuffy the Corgi (2014), and Videoball (2016). The group convened in 2010 as Rogers worked on Ziggurat based on an idea he had while playing Angry Birds {{that he could not}} complete on his own. Porter joined Action Button after responding to a call for artists Rogers made via Twitter, and Kerwin joined based on a connection he had with Rogers from producing a mockup of a game concept Rogers outlined in his Kotaku column.|$|E
5|$|Brooks & Dunn is an American {{country music}} duo {{consisting}} of Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn, both vocalists and songwriters.

40|$|Timing Anomalies are {{characterized}} by counterintuitive timing behaviour. A locally faster execution leads to an increase of the execution time of the whole program. The presence of such behaviour makes WCET analysis more di±cult: It is not safe to assume local worst-case behaviour wherever the analysis encounters uncer- tainty. Existing definitions <b>of</b> <b>Timing</b> Anomalies are rather imprecise and intuitive in nature. Some do not cover all kinds <b>of</b> known <b>Timing</b> Anomalies. After giving an overview of related work, we give a concise formal definition <b>of</b> <b>Timing</b> Anomalies. We then begin to identify di®erent classes of anomalies. One of these classes, coined Scheduling Timing Anomalies, coincides with previous restricted definitions...|$|R

5|$|According to Sorrell, {{the first}} design {{proposal}} for the game had the working title ‘Dead Man Dan’ and described a game that was initially a fusion of Capcom's Ghost'n Goblins combined with the art style <b>of</b> <b>Tim</b> Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. As development progressed, lead artist Wilson pushed the game into more of a Zelda role playing game-influenced direction {{as opposed to the}} original arcade-style concept. Looking to attract a major publishing deal, Millennium Interactive initially began working on multiple platforms including Windows and the Sega Saturn before giving Sony of Europe a working demo of the game. Impressed by the progress, Sony signed MediEvil to be an exclusive PlayStation game and commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio as Sony's second studio in the United Kingdom, after Psygnosis. During the production of the demo, there was a programmer for each platform. Millennium were having financial difficulties and wanted to secure a publisher quickly. Sega and Microsoft were also interested in the game.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Young Battling Nelson again, in {{a rematch}} set in Binghamton, Dyer lost on points {{a week later}} to Wisconsin fighter Pal Reed. He continued to appear at charity contests in the early half of 1919, mainly for the Boxers' Loyalty League, sparring with the likes <b>of</b> <b>Tim</b> Healy and Silas Green. By now Dyer's vaudeville bookings were far outnumbering his boxing appearances and {{in the latter half}} of 1919 he faced only a handful of opponents in paid boxing matches. These included a newspaper decision loss to Steve Latzo in May and a win over Johnny Evans in New Jersey in July. Between August and September Dyer was part of a touring boxing show organised by the Knights of Columbus, fighting for the entertainment of returned and injured soldiers. Dyer fought a few more professional bouts in America, a draw and a loss to Joe Egan and a newspaper decision win over Jimmy Gray, but by 1920 Dyer had left the country and had returned to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina were {{requested}} by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to renounce participation in the 2013 Malagasy presidential elections in order to hasten {{an end to the}} ongoing political crisis. On 10 December 2012, Ravalomanana announced that he would not participate in the elections, and encouraged Rajoelina to follow suit, in line with SADC recommendations. Rajoelina complied; however, when Ravalomanana's wife Lalao submitted her candidacy several months later, Rajoelina resubmitted his candidacy, declaring that Marc Ravalomanana sought to govern by proxy through his wife. In August 2013, a special electoral court invalidated the candidacy of Lalao Ravalomanana, as well as her chief competitors Rajoelina and Ratsiraka. TGV candidate Hery Rajaonarimampianina was elected president in January 2014, defeating Jean-Louis Robinson, the candidate of Marc Ravalomanana's camp. Upon attempting to return to Madagascar in October 2014 Ravalomanana was arrested, having been sentenced in absentia to lifelong hard labour for abuses of power by the Rajoelina administration. After his sentence was lifted and he was freed from house arrest in May 2015, Ravalomanana recommenced broadcasts at his MBS radio station, announced the re-opening of the TIKO business group, and was re-elected the president <b>of</b> <b>TIM.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} equational theory <b>of</b> <b>Timed</b> CCS as {{proposed}} by Wang Yi in CONCUR’ 90. Common to Wang Yi’s paper, we particularly focus on a class of linearly-ordered time domains exemplified by the positive real or rational numbers. We show that, even when the set of basic actions is a singleton, there are parallel Timed CCS processes {{that do not have}} any sequential equivalent and thus improve on the Gap Theorem for Timed CCS presented by Godskesen and Larsen in FSTTCS’ 92. Furthermore, we show that timed bisimilarity is not finitely based both for single-sorted and two-sorted presentations <b>of</b> <b>Timed</b> CCS. We further strengthen this result by showing that, unlike in some other process algebras, adding the untimed or the timed left-merge operator to the syntax and semantics <b>of</b> <b>Timed</b> CCS does not solve the axiomatizability problem. ...|$|R

A model in terms <b>of</b> <b>Timed</b> Automata satisfies the property given by a Constraint Diagram if the model in parallel composition with the semantics of the Constraint Diagram can reach a certain state.

5|$|By {{the time}} the fire was under control, the house was almost totally destroyed, leaving behind only the garage and some front stonework. The fire had spread rapidly, and {{although}} high winds contributed to the intensity, authorities deemed {{the speed with which}} the house had become fully involved suspicious enough to bring in arson investigators. The bodies <b>of</b> <b>Tim</b> and Kelly were not recovered until the following morning, when the house had cooled enough to permit safe searching. Kelly had perished in her bed, most likely of smoke inhalation. Tim's body was found on the ground floor, near the kitchen. Investigators at first assumed he had died trying to escape, but later determined that he had perished in or near his bedroom, most likely of smoke inhalation and heat, and that his body had fallen through burned flooring to where it was discovered.|$|E
5|$|From 2009 to 2012 Ravalomanana {{lived in}} exile in South Africa, where he was engaged in active {{negotiations}} with Rajoelina and former heads of state Albert Zafy and Didier Ratsiraka to organize national elections. In December 2012 he declared he would not present himself as a candidate, then a precondition to the elections being viewed as legitimate by the international community. TGV candidate Hery Rajaonarimampianina was elected president in January 2014, defeating Jean-Louis Robinson, the candidate of Marc Ravalomanana's camp. Upon attempting to return to Madagascar in October 2014 he was arrested, having been sentenced in absentia to lifelong hard labour for abuses of power by the Rajoelina administration.

5|$|Hergé sought work {{elsewhere}} too, creating The Lovable Mr. Mops cartoon for the Bon Marché department store, and The Adventures <b>of</b> <b>Tim</b> the Squirrel Out West for {{the rival}} L'Innovation department store. On 20 July 1932 he married Germaine Kieckens, who was Wallez's secretary; although {{neither of them}} were entirely happy with the union, they had been encouraged {{to do so by}} Wallez, who demanded that all his staff married and who personally carried out the wedding ceremony at the Saint-Roch Church in Laeken. Spending their honeymoon in Vianden, Luxembourg, the couple moved into an apartment in the rue Knapen, Schaerbeek. After Wallez was removed from the paper's editorship in August 1933 following a scandal, Hergé became despondent; in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after his monthly salary was increased from 2000 to 3000 francs and his workload was reduced, with Jamin taking responsibility for the day-to-day running of Le Petit Vingtième.|$|E
40|$|We propose some mild {{modifications}} to the syntax and semantics <b>of</b> <b>Timed</b> CSP which significantly increase expressiveness.
