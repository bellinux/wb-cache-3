Rotordynamic model(XLROTOR) for Gas Generator and Power Turbine were constructed. The XLROTOR response plots with changing bearing damping and stiffness coefficients were well matched with the coastdown plots of the test runs. The squeeze film dampers reduced effective support stiffness with respect to the rotational speed. Damping coefficients of squeeze film dampers were mainly determined by the XLROTOR model simulations. The damping coefficients changed with respect to the rotational speed.

40|$|Understanding {{lubrication}} failures at the shoe/swash plate contact {{of automotive}} swash plate compressors will greatly enhance {{the reliability of}} the air conditioning system. Maintaining proper lubrication is not always possible during transient conditions. Therefore, a method for detection of lubricant loss is of great interest to the automotive industry. Three methods for detecting lubrication loss were examined: contact resistance, acoustic emission, and dynamic pressure oscillations. A mobile air conditioning test stand capable of recording many system parameters was used. <b>Oil</b> <b>return</b> to the compressor was monitored using an oil separator and a refrigerant/oil concentration sensor. Data were taken during steady <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> rates and after oil shut off. The electrical contact resistance between the shoe and swashplate was used to indicate changes in the lubrication conditions at this critical interface. Measurements were taken at two <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> rates, during steady <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> tests. Preliminary results show that the minimum contact resistance is independent of the steady oil flow rates tested. In addition to the contact resistance, an acoustic emission (AE) sensor and a dynamic pressure transducer (DPX) were used to monitor oil film breakdown after oil shut off. Preliminary data indicate that the DPX may be an early indicator of low oil circulation. Even after several hours of operation after oil shut off, the magnitude of the contact resistance indicated no oil film breakdown had occurred.

30|$|By {{comparing}} Figures  14 and 15, one can {{see that}} when the piston rod is not subjected to a partial load, the oil is diffused to {{the periphery of the}} oil chamber in an elliptical shape. When the piston rod is subjected to a partial load, the oil is diffused into a square shape and the pressure in the <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> groove is low. Additionally, the pressure around the oil chamber gradually decreases and the pressure cloud map changes from orange to yellow, light green, and light blue in sequence. The pressure drop gradient is large and the pressure drop is significant. This is because the gap between the piston rod and sealing oil edge is reduced when the rod is subjected to a partial load. The oil in the oil chamber experiences increased resistance through the <b>return</b> <b>oil</b> gap and the <b>return</b> <b>oil</b> flow rate decreases. Therefore, the pressure in the <b>return</b> <b>oil</b> groove is lower than that without a partial load.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{presented}} in this paper is an experimental investigation of the <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> characteristics of alternative refrigerants for residential air conditioning systems using R 22. Due to the phase-out of HCFC refrigerants, the production of R 22 will be stopped by the year 2020. In some cases of vapor compression systems installed in the field, {{it will be necessary to}} replace the R 22 with alternative drop-in refrigerants as a part of maintenance procedures. Since R 22 system typically use mineral oils and HFC replacement refrigerants use POE or PAG oils. It may be necessary to change the type of oil used inside the system when retrofitting an existing R 22 system with an alternative drop-in refrigerant. Changing the oil in a vapor compression system is an expensive proposition due to the required flushing and cleaning of the system before the new oil can be installed. Therefore, refrigerant manufacturers are searching for alternative refrigerants, which are compatible with mineral oils and have similar working performance and conditions as R 22. The measurement of the <b>oil</b> <b>return</b> in the suction line helps to draw conclusions about the ability of the oil circulating back to the compressor.

Modeling the equity returns volatility requires using GARCH-type models. These models help to explore the pronounced differences of the conditional variance structures across sectors and markets. Chapter 1 compares the effects of changes in <b>oil</b> price <b>return</b> and its volatility on equity returns and volatility across sectors. The findings of this chapter show that despite the GCC states dependency on oil revenues, equity market performance at the sectoral level do not exactly associate with oil movements. Our results, in particular, show that the GCC stock markets do not always move hand-in-hand with oil market movements. In chapter 2, we explore the relationship within a specific sector, i. e.
