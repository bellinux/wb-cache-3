40|$|This Article closely {{examines}} the rationale offered {{for the new}} quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, and concludes that it cannot withstand careful analysis. Courts have explained that the new theory of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction is necessary to fill gaps in the state 2 ̆ 7 s long arm statute. However, gaps in a long arm statute can be filled by legislative amendments which can provide in personam jurisdiction up to the full extent permitted by due process. In fact, long arm statutes have steadily expanded {{over the last decade}} to take up the slack left by Shaffer. In personam jurisdiction under a long arm statute is far preferable to the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction. Indeed, given its reliance on attachment, its limited res judicata effect, and its vague and uncertain standards, the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction may very well be unconstitutional and is surely bad policy. Moreover, {{the manner in which the}} new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction has been unilaterally forged by courts violates separation of powers. This Article argues, therefore, that state courts should not succumb to the temptation to embrace the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, and that it should be repudiated in New York and the other states that follow it. This Article is divided into three parts. Part I discusses the development of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, and {{examines the}} Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Shaffer. Part II surveys the use of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction <b>in</b> the states since Shaffer. It traces and analyzes the growth of the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction doctrine, considers the causes of this development, and contrasts the new doctrine with the developments in the large majority of states that have not used quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction since Shaffer. Part III considers the contemporary validity of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, and demonstrates that it is no longer a valid jurisdictional device. The Article concludes that the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction threatens to resuscitate a doctrine that, after honorable service, deserves retirement...|$|R

40|$|The Scoring System for Latent Structure (SSLS) {{was used}} to test three {{hypotheses}} regarding the degree of self-participation in dreams reported during sleep onset (SO) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These hypotheses were that (a) the ratio of interactive to associative sentences would be significantly greater <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> than <b>in</b> SO; (b) the level of Ego activity would be significantly greater <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> than <b>in</b> SO; and (c) the ratio between interactive sentences with Ego not present and interactive sentences with Ego present would be significantly different <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> and <b>in</b> SO. None of these hypotheses was confirmed. However, the following significant differences were found: (a) the ratio between sentences with Ego substituted and the total number of interactive sentences was greater <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> than <b>in</b> SO (p less than 0. 05); (b) the ratio between sentences with Ego substituted and sentences with Ego present was greater (p less than 0. 05) <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> than <b>in</b> SO; (c) the ratio between sentences with Ego inserted and sentences with Ego substituted was greater in SO than <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> (p less than 0. 01); and (d) the relative incidence of defective Ego was greater (p less than 0. 01) in SO than <b>in</b> <b>REM.</b> These data were interpreted in terms of psychodynamic models of dream formation...|$|R

50|$|Three {{types of}} {{jurisdiction}} developed, collectively termed territorial jurisdiction {{because of their}} reliance upon territorial control: in personam jurisdiction, <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, and quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction. Some sources refer to all three types of territorial jurisdiction as personal jurisdiction, since most actions against property (<b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction) bear, <b>in</b> the end, upon the rights and obligations of persons. Others continue to recognize the traditional distinction between personal jurisdiction and jurisdiction over property, even after Shaffer v. Heitner (discussed below).|$|R

5000|$|On June 24, 1977, in {{the case}} of Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that the {{requirement}} that the circumstances giving rise to jurisdiction comply with the notion of [...] "fair play and substantial justice" [...] should apply to the quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction questions. The Supreme Court significantly diminished the utility of the quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction because if the case meets the minimum contacts, fair play and substantial justice tests, the action can be brought under the in personam jurisdiction. Quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, however, can still be an effective option to bring the lawsuit to a particular court because quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction allows to overcome limitations of the long-arm statute of a particular state.|$|R
5000|$|A quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> {{legal action}} (Latin, [...] "as if against a thing") {{is a legal}} action based on {{property}} rights of a person absent from the jurisdiction.

Quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction does not have much function in the United States any longer. However, in very specific cases, quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction can still be effective.|$|R

Under territorial jurisdiction, <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction could be exercised by the courts of a state by seizing the property in question. Since an actual tract of land could not literally be brought into a courtroom as a person could, this was effected by giving notice upon the real property itself. <b>In</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction was thus supported by {{the assumption that the}} owner of that property, having a concrete economic interest in the property, had a duty to look after the affairs of their property, and would be notified of the pending case by such seizure. <b>In</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction was limited to deciding issues regarding the specific property in question.|$|R

40|$|United States civil {{forfeiture}} laws are rooted <b>in</b> admiralty <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> forfeiture proceedings that {{go back to}} mid- 1700 s English customs law, and a statute called the Act of Frauds.

Similarly, when it came to using <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> seizure to enforce the customs laws, the Crown used a burden shifting presumption that was also born of necessity. Vessel owners were required to come forward and exculpate their vessel once the Crown showed probable cause of a violation. In Locke v. United States, Justice Marshall upheld that burden shifting presumption and the definition of probable cause in the admiralty <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> seizure context as a showing of reasonable suspicion, something less than a prima facie case. Sixty years later, however, the United States courts would begin to uphold uses of <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> forfeiture outside of the context of customs law, and today, statutory forfeiture provisions are constitutional scholars question whether or not {{civil forfeiture}} proceedings, having entered the law in the narrow context of admiralty <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> forfeiture proceedings, do an end run around the Fourth Amendment and Due Process.

50|$|The {{issue in}} this case {{involved}} a court ordered liquidation {{of a piece of}} land which had been purchased by Neff. Neff was not a resident of the state in which the land was located. In ordering a sale of the land to fulfill a judgment, the court had failed to issue proper notice to Neff, who resided in another state. The service had not been in personam. The Supreme Court ruled that the sale of the land was illegal because the service of the notice or subpoena had not been proper. There is no personal jurisdiction over a defendant unless the defendant is served with a subpoena while physically within the state where the court issuing the subpoena is located and has jurisdiction. The court could have avoided the issue by first creating a prejudgment writ of attachment to freeze the asset represented by the land in question quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> or <b>in</b> <b>rem,</b> meaning a thing.
