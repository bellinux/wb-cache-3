5|$|The Deep Impact {{mission was}} planned to help answer {{fundamental}} questions about comets, which included what {{makes up the}} composition of the comet's nucleus, what depth the crater would reach from the impact, and where the comet originated in its formation. By observing the composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet,</b> astronomers hoped to determine how comets form based on the differences between the interior and exterior makeup <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet.</b> Observations of the impact and its aftermath would allow astronomers to attempt to determine the answers to these questions.|$|E
5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp was {{observed}} intensively by astronomers during its perihelion passage, and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations. The dust production rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> was very high (up to 2.0 kg/s), {{which may have}} made the inner coma optically thick. Based on {{the properties of the}} dust grains—high temperature, high albedo and strong 10μm silicate emission feature—the astronomers concluded the dust grains are smaller than observed in any other comet.|$|E
500|$|Regarding <b>the</b> {{press conference}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet’s</b> discovery, Hale praised the {{reporting}} done by “the very first reporter that broke <b>the</b> story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet’s</b> discovery,” <b>the</b> Albuquerque Journal’s science reporter John Fleck: ...|$|R
2500|$|League {{president}} Donna Orender {{said that}} <b>the</b> collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> {{was not a}} sign that the WNBA was in trouble.

50|$|Donati's comet (now officially {{designated}} C/1858 L1 and 1858 VI), {{the second}} most brilliant <b>comet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, had been {{considered to be a}} return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comets</b> <b>of</b> 1556, 1264, and 975. Earlier, in 1856, Karl Ludwig von Littrow had discovered at the Vienna State Archives a pamphlet by Joachim Heller containing observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Comet</b> <b>of</b> 1556 as well as a broadsheet by Paul Fabricius with a map <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> course. Using Littrow's discovered materials, Hoek proved conclusively that <b>the</b> <b>comets</b> <b>of</b> 1264 and 1556 were not identical, and that Donati's comet did not therefore represent their reappearance.|$|R
5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp's {{activity}} and outgassing were not spread uniformly over its nucleus, but instead came from several specific jets. Observations {{of the material}} streaming away from these jets allowed astronomers to measure the rotation period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet,</b> which {{was found to be}} about 11 hours 46 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp {{showed the}} highest ever linear {{polarization}} detected for any comet. Such polarization {{is the result}} of solar radiation getting scattered by the dust particles in the coma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> and depends {{on the nature of the}} grains. It further confirms that the dust grains in the coma of comet Hale–Bopp were smaller than inferred in any other comet.|$|E
5|$|In 42 BC, Octavian {{began the}} Temple of Divus Iulius or Temple <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> Star and added Divi Filius (Son of the Divine) {{to his name}} in order to {{strengthen}} his political ties to Caesar's former soldiers by following the deification of Caesar, becoming Gaius Julius Caesar Divi Filius.|$|E

50|$|Edward D. Swift (Echo Mountain, California, USA) rediscovered <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> on November 21, 1894.

25|$|In 1705, Edmond Halley (1656–1742) applied Newton's {{method to}} twenty-three cometary apparitions that had {{occurred}} between 1337 and 1698. He noted that three <b>of</b> these, <b>the</b> <b>comets</b> <b>of</b> 1531, 1607, and 1682, had very similar orbital elements, and he was further able {{to account for the}} slight differences in their orbits in terms of gravitational perturbation by Jupiter and Saturn. Confident that these three apparitions had been three appearances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same <b>comet,</b> he predicted that it would appear again in 1758–9. (Earlier, Robert Hooke had identified <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> <b>of</b> 1664 with that of 1618, while Giovanni Domenico Cassini had suspected <b>the</b> identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comets</b> <b>of</b> 1577, 1665, and 1680. Both were incorrect.) Halley's predicted return date was later refined by a team of three French mathematicians: Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute, who predicted <b>the</b> date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> 1759 perihelion to within one month's accuracy. When <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> returned as predicted, it became known as Halley's <b>Comet</b> (with <b>the</b> latter-day designation <b>of</b> 1P/Halley). It next appears in 2061.|$|R
5|$|The first {{astronomer}} {{to record}} observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> was W. H. Finlay, the Chief Assistant at the Royal Observatory in Cape Town, South Africa. Finlay's observation on 7 September at 16h GMT {{was also an}} independent discovery, and he reported that the comet had an apparent magnitude of about 3, and a tail about a degree in length.|$|E
5|$|The {{impactor}} was maneuvered {{to plant}} itself in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet,</b> so that Tempel 1 would collide with it. Impact occurred at 05:45 UTC (05:52 Ground UTC, +/- {{up to three}} minutes, one-way light time = 7m 26s) {{on the morning of}} July 4, 2005, within one second of the expected time for impact.|$|E
5|$|The nucleus {{reached its}} maximum {{apparent}} size in December 1882. The comet faded gradually, but despite its fragmentation it remained {{visible to the}} naked eye until February 1883.

5|$|Deep Impact {{observed}} Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1) from February 20 to April 8, 2012, {{using its}} Medium Resolution Instrument, {{through a variety}} of filters. The comet was 1.75–2.11 astronomical units (AU) (2.62–3.16×108 km) from the Sun and 1.87–1.30 AU from the spacecraft. It was found that the outgassing from the comet varies with a period of 10.4 hours, which is presumed to be due to the rotation of its nucleus. The dry ice content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> was measured and found to be about ten percent of its water ice content by number of molecules.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA {{space probe}} {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005. It {{was designed to}} study the interior composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> Tempel 1 (9P/Tempel), by releasing an impactor into the comet. At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from {{the interior of the}} nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, obscuring the view of the impact crater.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 a {{paper was}} {{published}} that hypothesised {{the existence of}} a binary nucleus to fully explain the observed pattern of comet Hale–Bopp's dust emission observed in October 1995. The paper was based on theoretical analysis, and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30km, with the main nucleus being about 70km across, and would orbit in about three days at a distance of about 180km. This analysis was confirmed by observations in 1996 using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope which had taken images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> that revealed the satellite.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that <b>the</b> {{photochemical}} lifetime <b>of</b> OH in comets is a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> radial velocity. <b>The</b> calculated lifetime at 1 AU can vary between 69, 000 and 210, 000 sec for radial velocities that vary from - 58 to + 59 km/sec. A comparison between the scale lengths observed for three comets and those calculated based upon the theoretical lifetime has been made. This comparison shows that in two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comets</b> <b>the</b> lifetime derived from the scale lengths is a factor of 1. 7 larger than the theoretical lifetime. Suggestions are made about <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> this discrepancy...|$|R
5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> dust tail roughly {{followed}} <b>the</b> path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> {{orbit and}} <b>the</b> gas tail pointed almost directly {{away from the}} Sun, the sodium tail appeared to lie between the two. This implies that the sodium atoms are driven away from <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> head by radiation pressure.|$|R

5|$|Studies of {{the orbit}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> {{showed that the}} Great Comet of 1882 was moving on an almost {{identical}} path to previous great comets seen in C/1843 D1 and C/1880 C1. These comets had also suddenly appeared in the morning sky and had passed extremely close to the Sun at perihelion. One suggestion was that all three were in fact the same comet, with an orbital period that was being drastically shortened at each perihelion passage. However, studies showed this to be untenable, as the orbital period of this comet is 772 ± 3 years {{and the others are}} 600–800 years.|$|E

In 1969, when the Comet 4's design was modified by Hawker Siddeley to become {{the basis for the}} Nimrod, the cockpit layout was completely redesigned and bore little resemblance to its predecessors except for the control yoke.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} that the comet {{was likely to}} collide with Jupiter caused great excitement within the astronomical community and beyond, as astronomers had never before seen two significant Solar System bodies collide. Intense studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> were undertaken, and as its orbit became more accurately established, {{the possibility of a}} collision became a certainty. The collision would provide a unique opportunity for scientists to look inside Jupiter's atmosphere, as the collisions were expected to cause eruptions of material from the layers normally hidden beneath the clouds.|$|E

5|$|Two {{established}} meteor showers {{originate from}} within Corvus' boundaries. German astronomer Cuno Hoffmeister discovered and named the Corvids in 1937, after observing them between June 25 and July 2. They {{have not been}} seen since, nor was there evidence of a shower when previous records were examined. Hoffmeister noted the trajectory of the shower {{was similar to that}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> 11P/Tempel–Swift–LINEAR, though this was not confirmed by Zhukov and colleagues in 2011. The shower has been tentatively linked with 4015 Wilson–Harrington. In January 2013, the MO Video Meteor Network published the discovery of the Eta Corvids, assigning some 300 meteors seen between January 20 and 26. Their existence was confirmed by data analysis later that year.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} of the structural problems of the early series, all remaining Comets were withdrawn from service, while de Havilland launched a major effort to build a new version that would be both larger and stronger. All outstanding orders for the Comet 2 were cancelled by airline customers. The square windows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Comet</b> 1 were replaced by the oval versions used on the Comet 2, which first flew in 1953, and the skin thickness was increased slightly. Remaining Comet 1s and 1As were either scrapped or modified with oval windows and rip-stop doublers.|$|E
5|$|A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing {{close to}} the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process called outgassing. This {{produces}} a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due {{to the effects of}} solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet.</b> Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.|$|E

40|$|A unified {{model is}} {{formulated}} to interpret quantitatively <b>the</b> observed characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nuclear train, the two dust trails, and <b>the</b> tail region <b>of</b> P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 {{in terms of}} a collisionally modified rotation velocity distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> debris. Since there is no evidence for <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> out-gassing, <b>the</b> model does not assume activity. <b>The</b> discruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parent <b>comet</b> was due primarily to tidal stesses during its extremely close approach to Juptier in July 1992. The original nucleus is found to have been most probably approximately 5 km in radius or, equivalently, approximately 10 (exp 17) g in mass. <b>The</b> dynamical separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debris occurred apparently approximately 2. 2 hr after the perijove passage, even though <b>the</b> actual fragmentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original mass is likely to have begun before closest approach. Physical breakp was accompanied by ubiquitous low-velocity collisions among the particulates, resulting in a rearrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial rotaional velocities into a rapidly 'thermalized' distribution, characterized by a long tail of relatively high velocities for the debris that populates the dust trails far from the nuclear train. Compelling evidence is presented for secondary fragmentation events, indicative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> continuing disintegration. Secondary fragmentation may be caused by rotational bursting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> massive fragments that had been cracked but unbroken during the tidal disruption.
