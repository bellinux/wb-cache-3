40|$|The {{impact of}} gate-to-source/drain <b>overlap</b> <b>length</b> on {{performance}} and variability of 65 nm CMOS is presented. The device and circuit variability is investigated {{as a function}} of three significant process parameters, namely gate length, gate oxide thickness, and halo dose. The comparison is made with three different values of gate-to-source/drain <b>overlap</b> <b>length</b> namely 5 nm, 0 nm, and - 5 nm and at two different leakage currents of 10 nA and 100 nA. The Worst-Case-Analysis approach is used to study the inverter delay fluctuations at the process corners. The drive current of the device for device robustness and stage delay of an inverter for circuit robustness are taken as performance metrics. The design trade-off between performance and variability is demonstrated both at the device level and circuit level. It is shown that larger <b>overlap</b> <b>length</b> leads to better performance, while smaller <b>overlap</b> <b>length</b> results in better variability. Performance trades with variability as <b>overlap</b> <b>length</b> is varied. An optimal value of <b>overlap</b> <b>length</b> of 0 nm is recommended at 65 nm gate length, for a reasonable combination of performance and variability...|$|E

Both, {{experimental}} {{investigation and}} {{finite element analysis}} of single-lap adhesive joints subjected to tension have been done to find out an optimal <b>overlap</b> <b>length.</b> As the adherend material aluminum was considered with the two component high-strength engineering adhesive for the bonding of the layers.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} {{research}} was to find an optimum <b>overlap</b> <b>length</b> ensuring the settled bearing performance of adhesive bonded joint. At the optimum <b>overlap</b> <b>length</b> {{it is possible to}} reach a maximum load bearing capacity using a minimum quantity of applied adhesive. Design/methodology/approach: In accordance with experimental test results, an optimum <b>overlap</b> <b>length</b> was achieved. In numerical analysis, the proposed material model (MISO) fits well in simulations. Findings: Mechanical properties of adhesive which are often public unknown have very strong influence on reliability of material models used in numerical analysis.

40|$|The overlap and {{separation}} distances of relay zones follow a power-law scaling relationship over nearly 8 orders of magnitude. Approximately one {{order of magnitude}} scatter in both separation and overlap exists at all scales. The strong power-law relationship (R 2 = 0. 98) suggests that the primary control on relay aspect ratio (overlap/separation) is a scale-invariant process, such as the stress interaction between the overlapping fault tips as suggested by previous authors. Within the compiled global dataset host rock lithology {{does not appear to}} be a first-order control. Much of the observed scatter can be attributed to the spread of measurements recorded from individual relay zones, which relates to the evolving three-dimensional geometry of the relay zone as displacements on the bounding faults increase. Relay ramps exposed at two localities where the faults cut layered sedimentary sequences display mean aspect ratios of 8. 20 and 8. 64 respectively, more than twice the global mean (4. 2). Such high aspect ratios can be attributed to the relay-bounding faults having initially been confined within competent layers, facilitating the development of large <b>overlap</b> <b>lengths.</b> The presence of pre-existing structures (veins) at fault tips may also enhance fault propagation, giving rise to increased <b>overlap</b> <b>lengths.</b> ...|$|R

The influence of material and geometric nonlinearity of the adhesive as well as the impact of the recess length was examined in terms of maximum principal stresses. The strength of the joint was obtained as the load to initiate the crack propagation. Results suggested that either adding a spew fillet or considering the adhesive plasticity led to reduced peak stresses {{at the edge of the}} adhesive layer. The presence of a spew fillet in the single-lap joint with a recess length of 50 % of the <b>overlap</b> <b>length</b> reduced the peak stress concentrations in the adhesive layer by 45. 2 % and subsequently improved the strength of the joint by 36. 3 %.

For the recess length as 70 % and 90 % of the total <b>overlap</b> <b>length,</b> the strength of the joints reduced 36. 4 % and 66. 3 %, respectively.

40|$|Microtubule {{organization}} in cells {{is an important}} process. An example of careful microtubule organization is the mitotic spindle. The spindle is a bipolar structure with microtubules emanating from the poles at both sides. These microtubules form antiparallel overlaps in {{the centre of the}} spindle where they are bundled by bundling proteins. The overlaps are centred in the spindle and their constant length is regulated. The overlaps are important for the stability of the microtubule network, without bundling proteins the overlaps are lost and the spindle collapses. The antiparallel overlaps are also the site where microtubules slide apart to induce spindle elongation. Sliding is induced by tetrameric motor proteins that can bind to two bundled microtubules. Spindle elongation also requires microtubule growth at the overlaps. All these different functions at the overlap, sliding, growth/shrinkage and bundling, have to cooperate to maintain <b>overlap</b> <b>length.</b> While sliding reduces <b>overlap</b> <b>length,</b> growth will increase <b>overlap</b> <b>length.</b> These activities have to be coordinated for the maintenance of a constant <b>overlap</b> <b>length.</b> We propose that a feedback mechanism is present where growth of the microtubules is limiting the sliding in the overlap. This would prevent sliding when the overlap decreases and helps to maintain the overlap. We designed in vitro experiments to make antiparallel overlaps in vitro. In these experiments we use purified proteins from S. pombe. We combine ase 1 and klp 9 in a relative sliding assay to mimic the sliding in the midzone. In our experiments we combine relative sliding with dynamic microtubules for the first time. This allows us to test how these activities are coordinated.
