5|$|Firefighters {{from the}} Fire Department <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York (FDNY), {{at that time}} a {{volunteer}} organization, arrived {{under the command of}} Chief Engineer Cornelius Anderson. As the fire grew, the FDNY personnel were joined by retired fire chiefs from the city and firefighting crews from Brooklyn, Newark, and Williamsburg. Firemen battling the blaze were aided by water flowing from the Croton Aqueduct, which had been completed in 1842. The fire either weakened in intensity or had been subdued by firefighters by 1:00 p.m. that day.|$|E

5|$|The Hamden tornado {{was by far}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} tornado of this family, and possibly the most damaging of the entire outbreak. It touched down at 5:38pm near the Wilbur Cross Parkway. Industrial cranes and cars were tossed through the air, and rows of houses, as well as an industrial park, were flattened. The tornado lifted just a few minutes later at 5:45. The damage path was only five miles long, stopping just short <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Haven, but it damaged or destroyed almost 400 structures in its path.|$|E

5|$|Briskin {{was born}} on February 8, 1896 in either Riga, Russia or New York City. His Parents were Benjamin and Rose Briskin. Two of his brothers, Irving and Murray also became film producers, while his sister, Ida, married a film studio executive. Briskin also had one other brother, Barnett (Barney), who {{was also in the}} film {{industry}} as a theater manager and in sales capacities. While some sources have his birthplace is Riga, Russia, others indicate that he was born in New York, after his parents immigrated there. Briskin was a product of the public school system.

5|$|By 1900, {{the burgeoning}} {{industrial}} town had 4,600 residents {{and two years}} later Reverend Bonaventure Piscopo, a member of the Apostolic Band for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, formed a new congregation in New Kensington to serve the immigrant work force, many of whom were Italian Catholics. The church was named after Saint Peter, the first pope. The parishioners of this new congregation were Italians living in and around New Kensington, Arnold, and Parnassus, which later became a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Kensington. These immigrants needed a place to worship and in 1903, the St. Peter congregation began holding Mass with a resident pastor, Reverend Vincenzo Maselli in a small building on the corner of Second Avenue and Tenth Street (known as the downtown area) in New Kensington.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its initial}} {{focus on the}} elites, the Union was {{successful}} in raising funds from across French society. Schoolchildren and ordinary citizens gave, as did 181French municipalities. Laboulaye's political allies supported the call, as did descendants of the French contingent in the American Revolutionary War. Less idealistically, contributions came from those who hoped for American support in the French attempt to build the Panama Canal. The copper {{may have come from}} multiple sources and some of it is said to have come from a mine in Visnes, Norway, though this has not been conclusively determined after testing samples. According to Cara Sutherland in her book on the statue for the Museum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York, 90,800 kilos (200,000 pounds) was needed to build the statue, and the French copper industrialist Eugène Secrétan donated 58,100 kilos (128,000 pounds) of copper.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Harlan {{volunteered for}} {{military}} duty, {{serving as a}} colonel in the United States Army Air Force from 1943 to 1945. He was {{the chief of the}} Operational Analysis Section of the Eighth Air Force in England. He won the Legion of Merit from the United States, and the Croix de guerre from both France and Belgium. In 1946 Harlan returned to private law practice representing Du Pont family members against a federal antitrust lawsuit. In 1951, however, he returned to public service, serving as Chief Counsel to the New York State Crime Commission, where he investigated the relationship between organized crime and the state government as well as illegal gambling activities in New York and other areas. During this period Harlan also served as a committee chairman of the Association of the Bar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York, and to which he was later elected vice president. Harlan's main specialization at that time was corporate and anti-trust law.|$|E

5|$|After {{the events}} of the comic tie-in , the Master Chief crashes in eastern Africa, where he is found by Johnson and the Arbiter. The Chief, Johnson, and company fight Covenant in the jungle and arrive at a UNSC outpost. Here, Keyes and Lord Hood plan a final effort to stop the Covenant leader, the High Prophet of Truth, from {{activating}} a Forerunner artifact uncovered outside the ruins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Mombasa. The Chief clears anti-air Covenant defenses so Hood can lead the last of Earth's ships against the Prophet, but Truth activates the buried artifact, creating a slipspace portal which he and his followers enter. A Flood-infested ship crash-lands nearby; Elite forces arrive and vitrify Flood-infected areas of Earth, stopping the threat. Following a message Cortana left aboard the Flood ship, the Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes and their troops follow Truth through the portal. Joining them is 343 Guilty Spark, who aids the Chief as he has no function to fulfill after the destruction of his ringworld.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rain and}} winds buffeted many parishes located east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Orleans. A small radius {{near the center}} of the storm had much of the extreme rainfall, and limited the flooding, which could have been {{disastrous}} if it were widespread. Grand Isle and portions of the lower Plaquemines Parish were the worst hit in Louisiana. Additionally, Grand Isle reported a wind gust of 100 mph (160 km/h) and a storm surge of 5.2 feet (1.6 m). At New Orleans International Airport, sustained winds of 28 mph (45 km/h) and gusts of 33 mph (53 km/h) were reported on July 19. A gauge reported a water level of 4.85 feet (1.5 m) in Venice. Storm tides were 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters) above normal on average. A Coast Guard helicopter had to evacuate 7 Texans who were on a yacht in the Gulf of Mexico forty miles offshore, since their radio was broken and they were therefore unaware they were sailing into the storm. After being rescued, they were treated for minor injuries at a suburban New Orleans hospital.|$|E
5|$|On April 18, 1831, an {{institution}} was established, {{with the support}} of a group of prominent New York City residents from the city's merchants, bankers, and traders. Albert Gallatin was elected as the institution's first president. On April 21, 1831, the new institution received its charter and was incorporated as the University <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York by the New York State Legislature; older documents often refer to it by that name. The university has been popularly known as New York University since its inception and was officially renamed New York University in 1896. In 1832, NYU held its first classes in rented rooms of four-story Clinton Hall, situated near City Hall. In 1835, the School of Law, NYU's first professional school, was established. Although the impetus to found a new school was partly a reaction by evangelical Presbyterians to what they perceived as the Episcopalianism of Columbia College, NYU was created non-denominational, unlike many American colleges at the time. American Chemical Society was founded in 1876 at NYU.|$|E
