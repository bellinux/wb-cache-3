During the tour the brothers' increasingly deteriorating relationship ultimately led to Noel Gallagher announcing in August 2009 {{that he would be}} leaving the band after a backstage altercation with Liam before a festival appearance. The band, comprising the remaining members of Oasis and led by Liam Gallagher, decided to continue working together under the name Beady Eye until breaking up in 2014, while Noel went on to form his solo project Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.|$|E

5|$|Oasis' debut album, Definitely Maybe (1994), {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the band's rise to fame as part of the Britpop movement. Oasis' second album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995), reached the top of the album charts in many countries and their third studio album, Be Here Now (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Britpop eventually declined in popularity and Oasis' next two albums failed to revive it. However, the band's final two albums, Don't Believe the Truth (2005) and Dig <b>Out</b> <b>Your</b> Soul (2008), were hailed as its best efforts in over a decade and found renewed success. On 28 August 2009, following an altercation with Liam prior to a gig in Paris, Noel Gallagher announced his departure from Oasis and on 23 October 2009, he confirmed he would embark on a solo career. Gallagher would go on to form Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.|$|E

25|$|Doherty {{has been}} working on new {{acoustic}} material, similar to the wealth of his unreleased songs that can already be downloaded on the internet. On his own, and often with his band, he has continued The Libertines' tradition of performing on short notice guerrilla gigs in small venues. On New Year's Eve 2005, Doherty held a guerrilla gig in his North London flat where he showcased some of his solo works, many of which later leaked onto the internet. 31 March and 1 April 2006 Doherty was performing two surprising solo gigs, his first in mainland Europe, at the NonStop Kino pornographic cinema and venue in Graz, Austria, after he failed to turn up for an earlier arrangement in January. For this occasion he produced, at the suggestion of Bettina Aichbauer, friend of Doherty and owner of the NonStop Kino, a film with the title Spew It <b>Out</b> <b>Your</b> Soul which he showed on screen during his performance.|$|E
25|$|The song {{became a}} {{favourite}} at Oasis's live performances. Noel encouraged {{the crowd to}} sing along and often kept quiet during the first chorus, allowing the fans instead to sing along while he played the song's guitar part. During the Dig <b>Out</b> <b>Your</b> Soul Tour, Noel Gallagher abandoned the song's previous, full-band live arrangement in favour of a much slower, primarily acoustic arrangement in a lower key (B major). From 2008 through Oasis's breakup, the song was performed by Gallagher on his Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar backed up by Gem Archer on electric guitar, and Chris Sharrock playing tambourine. On 11 and 12 July 2009, during performances of the song at London's Wembley Stadium, Gallagher didn't sing a word; instead, he stood back, played guitar, and allowed the crowd to sing the entire song. Since 2011, he has alternated between the acoustic version and the original arrangement when playing the song with his solo project, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.|$|E
500|$|Gallagher {{stated in}} a 2006 radio {{interview}} with Russell Brand {{that he does}} not believe in God or [...] "an all-guiding force".

Dig <b>Out</b> <b>Your</b> Soul has been described by Gallagher as a [...] "religious Armageddon". But in recent interviews for Dig <b>Out</b> <b>Your</b> Soul regarding religion, he stated [...] "See, I don't know what I am. If I was an atheist I'd just write songs about not believing in God – but I don't know what I am." ...|$|E
