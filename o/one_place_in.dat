5|$|Again {{following}} {{the pattern of}} 2010, Roche also rode the Vuelta as Ag2r's squad leader. He hoped to improve upon both his dismal Tour, which he admitted was hampered by a crash sustained shortly beforehand at the Critérium du Dauphiné, and his seventh overall in the 2010 Vuelta. Their performance in the third Grand Tour team time trial of the season was even worse than the first two, as they were a paltry 19th of 22, immediately putting Roche 42 seconds off the pace. Roche led the peloton {{across the finish line}} in stage 3, but since it was for fifth place after breakaway riders took all the time bonuses, it had no substantial effect on his overall placing. Roche showed strongly on the Valdepeñas de Jaén climb in stage 5, finishing just 7 seconds behind stage winner Joaquim Rodríguez. However, since this final climb was rather short, time gaps were small throughout the field, and this performance only gained Roche <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the overall standings, moving him up to 25th. Stage 8 proved largely similar, as Rodríguez again won on a short, steep final climb, and Roche finished in the top ten on the day, 15 seconds back this time. He gained two places with this ride. Mondory contested two of the field sprints in the race's first week, but did not come particularly close to winning either, finishing eighth and then seventh in stages 2 and 7 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Qualification for {{the race}} was {{restricted}} to three athletes per National Olympic Committee (NOC), an organisation representing a country at the Olympics, until eight NOCs had three qualified athletes. Once eight NOCs had qualified three athletes; a NOC was limited to two entries. A NOC with an athlete who won {{one of the five}} continental championships (Africa, Asia, Pan America, Europe and Oceania) were given <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the event. Additionally, three places were available for the NOC of the medallists at the International Triathlon Union (ITU) World Qualification Event. Another 38 places were available to the NOCs with the highest ranked athletes on the ITU Olympic Qualification List on 31 May 2012. If an athlete had already qualified through another method the NOC did not receive another quota with it instead going to the next NOC on the ITU Olympic Qualification List. Five more entries into the event were given to one NOC per continental region. This was based on the ITU Olympic Qualification List with the highest ranked athlete from a non-qualified NOC in their continental region qualifying a place for their NOC in the event. One was given to the Great Britain NOC as the hosts but as they had already gained a place, the host place was given to the highest eligible athlete on the ITU Olympic Qualification List's NOC. The final two places for the event was given to two NOCs chosen by the Tripartite Commission.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{symbolism}} of the flag began to shift in the early 21st century as there was a warming of relations between the pan-Blue coalition in Taiwan and the Communist Party of China on mainland China. The flag of the Republic of China has begun to symbolize the existence of a past and possibly future unified China, and as such the government of the PRC {{has made it clear that}} for Taiwan to change the flag would be a major provocation in favor of Taiwan independence.

25|$|Today, {{the role}} of Trần Thủ Độ {{in the history of}} Vietnam is always a matter for debate between modern historians. For this reason, it was not until 2008 that a new street in Hanoi was named in honour of Trần Thủ Độ, a {{decision}} which is still met with some opposition from public opinion. Unlike his relatives Trần Hưng Đạo or Trần Quang Khải, the grand chancellor of the Trần Dynasty is worshipped in only <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> Hanoi which is the Cầu Đông Pagoda. However, {{on the occasion of the}} millenary anniversary of Hanoi, the Feature Film Studio 1 decided to invest 2.66 million USD for a 30-episode television movie named Trần Thủ Độ which will focus on his life and the turbulent period of the Late Lý and Early Trần Dynasty. In theatre, on the contrary, there were several plays which exploited the controversial role of Trần Thủ Độ in history such as Rừng trúc (Bamboo Forest) by the writer Nguyễn Huy Tưởng or Anh hùng và mỹ nhân (The Hero and the Beauty) by Chu Thơm. According to the stage director Lê Hùng, the life full of events of Trần Thủ Độ was a good source of inspiration in theatre because the play could focus on his inner feelings when Trần Thủ Độ had to act ruthlessly toward Lý clan for the benefit of his own Trần clan.|$|E
25|$|On 27 April Southampton {{hosted a}} West Brom side {{which had not}} won since 9 March. The game started {{relatively}} well for the home side, who dominated possession and had chances to score first within the opening few exchanges, {{but it was the}} visitors who opened against the run of play in the sixth minute when Marc-Antoine Fortuné turned in a corner on the third attempt to give the Baggies an early advantage. For Southampton the standout player was Jay Rodriguez, who took a number of opportunities to shoot but only hit the target a few times, although West Brom had their fair share of chances too (many involving Chelsea loanee Romelu Lukaku) in a largely cagey and scrappy opening 45 minutes. Gastón Ramírez came on at half time and was involved in a few early attacks for the hosts, but 25 minutes into the second half (after Lukaku had taken advantage of defensive errors to double his team's lead) he was sent off for an incident involving Fortuné following an alleged elbow on Shane Long, which also saw the West Brom goalscorer dismissed. Long later scored a third for the visitors, before referee Robert Madley – in charge of his first game in the Premier League – gave Danny Fox his second booking of the game and Southampton's second red card of the game (and of the season) to leave them with nine-men for the last ten minutes; due to other results, Southampton only dropped <b>one</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the league table.|$|E
