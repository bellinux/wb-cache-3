A new type of <b>Oscillograph</b> based on FPGA is proposed and designed in this paper. It consists of <b>oscillograph,</b> logic analyzer and signal generator. The resolution of the <b>oscillograph</b> is 8 bit and the maximum value can reach 200 Mbps with support of software based on windows operation system. That of the logic analyzer is 100 Msps with 16 channels. The resolution of signal generator is 140 Msps with 10 -bit...|$|R

5000|$|The {{profits from}} the <b>oscillographs</b> helped him invest in {{television}} design and his DuMont TV Network. Unfortunately the time spent on his TV ventures {{proved to be the}} end of his profitable oscillograph business. [...] In 1947 a young equipment manufacturer called Tektronix produced the model 511 Time Base Trigger and Sweep Oscilloscope for $795. [...] The use of time instead of frequency to measure a sweep across the CRT was Tektronix's big selling point. Time measurements are easier to interpret pulses and complex waveforms. [...] It has been mentioned informally that Allen DuMont saw the model 511 demonstrated at an electronics show. He tried it and was impressed, but commented to Howard Vollum and Jack Murdock, co-founders of Tektronix that it was too expensive and they would be lucky to sell any. [...] Tektronix's time base trigger and time sweep generator design would become the standard in the 1950s and into the 21st century. Tektronix would replace DuMont <b>Oscillographs</b> as the leading selling oscilloscope brand.|$|E
50|$|The first {{automated}} <b>oscillographs</b> used a galvanometer {{to move a}} pen {{across a}} scroll or drum of paper, capturing wave patterns onto a continuously moving scroll. Due to the relatively high-frequency speed of the waveforms compared to the slow reaction time of the mechanical components, the waveform image was not drawn directly but instead built up {{over a period of}} time by combining small pieces of many different waveforms, to create an averaged shape.|$|E

50|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the history and}} development of oscilloscope technology. The modern day digital oscilloscope grew out of multiple developments of analog oscilloscopes, which in turn {{grew out of the}} older <b>oscillograph.</b> The <b>oscillograph</b> started as a hand drawn chart which was later slightly automated. This then grew into galvanometer driven recorders and photographic recorders. Eventually, the cathode ray tube came along and displaced the <b>oscillograph,</b> eventually taking over the majority of the market when advancements such as triggers were added to them. With the lowering costs of digital circuitry, the digital oscilloscope has taken over the majority of the modern oscilloscope sales, with almost no makers offering analog cathode ray tube oscilloscopes. However, the <b>oscillograph</b> lives on to a degree in pen chart recorders for electrical signals.|$|R
50|$|This led him {{to invent}} the bifilar and soft iron <b>oscillographs.</b> These {{instruments}} won the grand prize at the St. Louis Exposition in 1904. They were {{more powerful than the}} classical stroboscope, invented in 1891 then in use. They remained the best way to record high-speed electrical phenomena for more than 40 years when they were replaced by the cathode ray oscilloscope. They paved the way for a greater understanding of the behavior of alternating current.|$|E

50|$|The German aural {{method was}} used by the Central Powers. This used an early warning {{listening}} post (LP) and a main LP in the centre with two secondary LPs 500-1000 metres slightly to the rear on either side. Stop watches were switched on when the sound reached the main LP, the secondary LP times were converted to a distance (via speed of sound) and circles plotted, another circle was then derived that touched these two circles and the main LP, the centre of this circle was the source of the sound. Corrections were made for conditions affecting the speed of sound. However, late in the war Germany introduced 'objective devices' - directional galvanometers, <b>oscillographs</b> and modified seismographs, with results directly transferred onto paper or photographic film.|$|E

5000|$|However, it was {{possible}} to accurately measure the difference between two signals. Much of the development of suitable equipment had been carried out between 1935 and 1938 as part of the efforts to deploy radar systems. The UK, in particular, had invested considerable effort in the development of their Chain Home system. The radar display systems for Chain Home were based on oscilloscopes (or <b>oscillographs</b> as they were known at time) triggered to start their sweep when the broadcast signal was sent. Return signals were amplified and sent into the 'scope display, producing a [...] "blip". By measuring the distance along the face of the oscilloscope of any blips, the time between broadcast and reception could be measured, thus revealing the range to the target.|$|E
50|$|Founder Alfred L. Williams began Brush Labs in 1919 {{to develop}} {{products}} that utilized piezoelectric crystals. Associates reorganized {{the company as}} Brush Development Company in 1930 with piezoelectric phonograph pickups as the company's main product. Later they began manufacturing wire recorders, microphones, and speakers. Research for improvements to wire recorders resulted in a contract from the US National Defense Research Council during World War II. Brush manufactured a dictation recorder in 1946. In 1950, Brush built the Model BL-206 and BL-216 Multichannel <b>Oscillographs,</b> and associate Model BL-932 DC Amplifiers. Brush Development Co. merged with the original Brush Labs and the Cleveland Graphite Bronze company in 1952. The new company was named Clevite. Audio products under the Brush trademark were sold until 1960. The Clevite company was absorbed by Gould-National Batteries in 1969.|$|E
50|$|Gabor {{was born}} as Günszberg Dénes, into a Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary. In 1918, his family {{converted}} to Lutheranism. Dennis was the first-born son of Günszberg Bernát and Jakobovits Adél. Despite having a religious background, religion played a minor {{role in his}} later life and he considered himself agnostic. In 1902, the family received permission to change their surname from Günszberg to Gábor. He served with the Hungarian artillery in northern Italy during World War I. He began his studies in engineering at the Technical University of Budapest in 1918, later in Germany, at the Charlottenburg Technical University in Berlin, {{now known as the}} Technical University of Berlin. At the start of his career, he analysed the properties of high voltage electric transmission lines by using cathode-beam <b>oscillographs,</b> which led to his interest in electron optics. Studying the fundamental processes of the oscillograph, Gabor was led to other electron-beam devices such as electron microscopes and TV tubes. He eventually wrote his PhD thesis on Recording of Transients in Electric Circuits with the Cathode Ray Oscillograph in 1927, and worked on plasma lamps.|$|E

50|$|Since DuMont was {{a leader}} in cathode ray tube or CRT design and manufacturing, {{it was a natural}} step to use the CRT as a visual {{measuring}} instrument or oscilloscope. The production of CRT's and oscilloscopes was part of DuMont Laboratories located in Upper Montclair, NJ. Needing more space he moved to a larger location in Passaic, NJ in 1934. Although not the inventor of the oscilloscope, DuMont designed and mass-produced practical oscilloscopes (he called them <b>oscillographs)</b> for all types of laboratory, automotive/equipment servicing and manufacturing applications. By the 1940s DuMont was the leader in the oscilloscope equipment market. DuMont was one of the earliest designers of the trigger sweep oscilloscope using a gas thyratron vacuum tube (forerunner to the silicon controlled rectifier or SCR). This allowed the oscilloscope to show a visual trace at a preset input signal level. In addition the sweep (trace across the CRT screen) could be regulated by the sweep speed or sweep frequency. This design allowed the oscilloscope to provide better visual detail of the measurement being studied. The trigger was a frequency synchronizing type which provided stability in viewing.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{principal}} contributions of Rao in the academic field was {{the establishment of a}} laboratory for Ionosphere and Space Research (ISRL) at the Waltair campus of Andhra University which would evolve into an advanced space science centre, and it was here, he hosted a number of researchers. He was also instrumental in introducing computer at the university. He maintained his interest in ultrasonics which he had worked on during his doctoral studies and his initial work at ISRL led to the discovery that diffraction patterns followed Braggs Law in high frequency regions. For furthering their research, the team led by him developed novel methodologies for measuring ultrasonic velocities in liquids and solids with high precision and developed purpose-built instruments such as transmitters, receivers and <b>oscillographs</b> for pulse measurement, seismic sounders and satellite signal recorders. He designed a multi-frequency HF phase path radar which was the first equipment of its kind that used spaced-receiver configuration. The other equipment developed by his team included an HF phase path sounder which was a first time development, as well as an ionospheric drift recorder, a meteor radar and a SOnic Detection And Ranging system (SODAR). He and his colleagues published seven articles detailing the body of their work in ultrasonics and six of them appeared in Nature. This pioneering research on ionospheric plasma contributed to the development of HF Doppler radar, meteor radar and SODAR systems presently in use. He also carried out studies on Ionospheric dynamo region and on the horizontal winds over a sunspot cycle. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles of which many have been listed by the article repository of the Indian Academy of Sciences. He also edited three books, Physics of the solid state : commemoration volume to Professor S. Bhagavantam, and Bhagavantam Volume: Volume in Honour of Prof. S. Bhagavantam on the Occasion of the 60th Birthday, 14.04.1969 both festschrifts on his mentor, as well as Science, Technology and Education for Prosperity, and his work has drawn citations in books published by others.|$|E
