25|$|With his assault {{schedule}} thrown <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>whack</b> by the PAVN, and {{his troops}} consequently in trouble, Vang Pao {{went looking for}} help. On 1 September, he made an emergency flight to Vientiane for a tense meeting with Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley at the airfield. Hoping to cadge more air support, the general blamed a shortage of tactical air for the offensive's lack of success. From Godley's standpoint, the Hmong unit commanders left much to be desired for combat leadership of a force crippled by trench foot. The ambassador {{made it clear that}} U.S. tactical air support was limited to 18 daily sorties. He then asked if Vang Pao would continue the offensive on those terms. At this, Vang Pao returned to battle, knowing that saving Long Tieng was essential for the Royalists.|$|E
500|$|Garbage {{later said}} that the album was {{released}} as a contractual obligation to Warner Music: [...] "This was the final straw that broke our backs", recalled Manson five years later. [...] "The record company we had been sold to in the U.K. demanded that we release a [...] "greatest hits" [...] {{in order to meet}} their quarterly requirements. We were {{not in a position to}} stop it. As a result, they shoved this collection out with no promotion whatsoever. It was right there and then that we realized how crazy and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>whack</b> things had gotten." [...] Garbage remained on hiatus for a further three years until regrouping to record their fifth studio album, Not Your Kind of People, released in 2012.|$|E
500|$|The {{launch of}} the Absolute Garbage promotional {{campaign}} began {{at the end of}} May 2007, when Geffen Records updated Garbage's Myspace profile streaming audio player to include the album's lead single [...] "Tell Me Where It Hurts" [...] and the remix of [...] "Bad Boyfriend", while the music video for [...] "Tell Me Where It Hurts" [...] was premiered on UK Channel 4's Video Exclusive slot. Radio edits of the Guitars Up and Orchestral versions of [...] "Tell Me Where It Hurts" [...] were distributed to radio at the beginning of June. In the United Kingdom, the song was playlisted by XFM Scotland Upfront, Radio Forth and was C-Listed on BBC Radio 2 for five weeks. The alternative rock remix of [...] "Push It" [...] was playlisted by XFM for three weeks. [...] "Tell Me Where It Hurts" [...] was released by A Records on 7" [...] vinyl, DVD and CD single (featuring [...] "Betcha" [...] as the B-side) on July 16 in the United Kingdom, where it debuted at number 50 on the UK Singles Chart. Manson complained that the release was [...] "shoved out with no promotion whatsoever", declaring that it was the moment the band [...] "realized how crazy and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>whack</b> things had gotten", inspiring them to work independently afterwards.|$|E
60|$|But {{there were}} other and larger phases of the game. Little {{business}} men, shopkeepers, and such ilk took what <b>whack</b> they could <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the product of the}} worker; but, after all, it was the large business men who formed the workers through the little business men. When all was said and done, the latter, like Jones in Petacha Valley, got no more than wages <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their <b>whack.</b> In truth, they were hired men for the large business men. Still again, higher up, were the big fellows. They used vast and complicated paraphernalia for the purpose, on a large scale of getting between hundreds of thousands of workers and their products. These men were not so much mere robbers as gamblers. And, not content with their direct winnings, being essentially gamblers, they raided one another. They called this feature of the game HIGH FINANCE. They were all engaged primarily in robbing the worker, but every little while they formed combinations and robbed one another of the accumulated loot. This explained the fifty-thousand-dollar raid on him by Holdsworthy and the ten-million-dollar raid on him by Dowsett, Letton, and Guggenhammer. And when he raided Panama Mail he had done exactly the same thing. Well, he concluded, it was finer sport robbing the robbers than robbing the poor stupid workers.|$|R

VanDerWerff felt that the story failed to work [...] "despite featuring Don Most and Valerie Mahaffey doing their very best". Canning thought Most's role as Emma's [...] "racist Ginger Supremacist father was perhaps the greatest bit of casting I've seen on television all year". Urban thought the subplot [...] "worked really well", though she added that there were [...] "missteps".

2500|$|Also {{in spring}} 759, Emperor Suzong, {{as a part}} of his {{reorganization}} of his chancellors, removed Miao Jinqing and Wang Yu from their chancellor posts and replaced them with Li Kui, Lü Yin, Li Xian, and Diwu Qi. [...] In Li Kui's case, he was given the post of Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau, which was not itself a chancellor post, but given the additional de facto chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor. [...] He was also put in charge of editing the imperial history. [...] At that time, there were much banditry within the city of Chang'an itself, and the powerful eunuch Li Fuguo wanted to commission several hundred soldiers from part of the imperial guard corps, the Yulin Army (羽林軍), to patrol the streets at night. [...] Li Kui opposed this, pointing out that the Yulin Army and another part of the imperial guards corps, the Jinwu Guards (金吾衛), which were already responsible for patrolling the streets, served as counterweights to each other, and allowing the Yulin Army to patrol the streets throw the balance <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>whack.</b> [...] Emperor Suzong agreed and tabled Li Fuguo's proposal.

2500|$|In April 2007, the Palm Beach Post {{newspaper}} broke a {{story in}} which it suggested the DVLMF was in serious financial trouble. The memorial foundation was running a deficit of almost $255,000, the newspaper said, and had more than $2 million in unpaid debts. The paper suggested that the foundation's spending was the problem. Nonprofit [...] "watchdog" [...] groups said charities should spend 75 percent on their mission program, 15 percent on administration, and just 10 percent on fundraising. But the DVLMF was spending 88 percent of its money on fundraising. The memorial foundation was strongly criticized on this point by watchdog groups. Charity Navigator Sandra Miniutti said her group gave the foundation zero out of four stars (its lowest rating) and scored DVLMF's operations: [...] "Their finances are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>whack,</b> and it appears they are not adhering to their mission". Charity Brands Marketing, a group which helps match donors to charities, was also highly critical. Their chief executive officer, Stephen Adler, warned DVLMF was spending too heavily on fundraising: [...] "The numbers tell the story, and that's not an acceptable number for a nonprofit". The Palm Beach Post also reported that Lois Pope had used money from her LIFE Foundation to keep the DVLMF afloat. The DVLMF was $267,089 in deficit {{by the end of}} 2001, and the LIFE Foundation's 2002 donation of $3.5 million had kept it afloat. Rick Fenstermacher, an DVLMF consultant, admitted that Pope had pledged even more, but declined to say how much the additional donation was worth.|$|E
