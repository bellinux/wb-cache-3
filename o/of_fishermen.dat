On land, Ismael caused 59 deaths in mainland Mexico and resulted in $26million in damage (1995USD, $ USD). The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000people homeless.

50|$|The {{following}} {{data regarding}} fisheries activities is collected: the kinds <b>of</b> <b>fisherman</b> in the fishery, commercial versus recreational, and the gear {{that is used}} (longline, rod and reel, nets, etc.), pounds of fish caught by each type <b>of</b> <b>fisherman,</b> the fishing effort each kind <b>of</b> <b>fisherman</b> expends, the age structure of the fish harvested by each group <b>of</b> <b>fisherman,</b> the ratio <b>of</b> males to females that are captured, how the fish are marketed, {{the value of the}} fish to the different fisherman groups, and the time and geographic location of the best catches. Also in the assessment, geographical boundaries of different stocks or populations are defined. From the combined biological and fisheries data, the current status and condition of the stock is defined and managers use this assessment to predict how in the future, stocks will respond to varying levels of fishing pressure. Ultimately managers want to reduce the level of overfishing that occurs and restore stocks that have been overfished.|$|R

However, because of the species' reputation for depleting shellfish resources, advocates for commercial, recreational, and subsistence shellfish harvesting have often opposed allowing the sea otter's range to increase, and there have even been instances <b>of</b> <b>fishermen</b> and others illegally killing them.|$|E

In total, the effects of Billie in Taiwan killed seven people. Extensive flooding also occurred in nearby eastern China, inundating rice fields.

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, there was a decline in the Ribeira shipyard activities, due to the aggradation of the Portuguese coast and the Povoan shipyard started to work in the construction of fishing vessels.

The Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon noticed their overwhelming notoriety in the Minho coast and considered Povoans to be the most expert fishermen from Cape St. Vincent to Caminha, with a sizable number <b>of</b> <b>fishermen,</b> ships and high sea fishing. The result was a very considerable quantity of caught fish.|$|E
5|$|The 2002–03 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} one of the longest lasting and the second-most active season in the South-West Indian Ocean. Storms during the season {{impacted}} the Mascarene Islands, Seychelles, Madagascar, and countries in southeastern Africa. The season began early when an unnamed tropical storm struck Seychelles in September, becoming the most damaging storm there in 50years. The next system, Atang, was the first named storm of the season, but was only a tropical depression; it was named due to the threat to an outer island of Mauritius. Atang later struck Tanzania in a climatologically unusual area in November, resulting in unconfirmed deaths <b>of</b> <b>fishermen.</b> The first named storm to reach tropical storm intensity was Boura, which brushed the Mascarene Islands with gusty winds and rainfall. In December, Cyclone Crystal threatened to strike Mauritius but instead veered eastward, and later, Tropical Storm Delfina lasted from late December through early January 2003. Delfina damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Mozambique and Malawi, killing 54people.|$|E

5|$|Crustaceans, such as sand fiddler {{crabs and}} shrimp, among the {{mangroves}} also occupy a significant {{place in the}} local economy. While {{a large number of}} shrimp species inhabit the Senegambian area, a single family exists in Casamance: Penaeidae. Southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis) are the most commonly collected. They were traditionally caught as part of local artisan fishing by men, women, and children. Shrimp collection in the area experienced significant development in the 1960s, following the establishment of European industrial units. The local fishermen switched to this method, and there was an increased presence <b>of</b> <b>fishermen</b> from other areas. A study in 2005 revealed {{the extent to which the}} shrimp population in the region has been depleted, citing multiple causes, including diminishing rainfall, over-salinization of the estuary, and poorly controlled harvesting. Along with the mangrove degradation, the civil unrest, and the inadequate fishery regulation, Casamance has had to deal with the closure in 2003 of a major industrial complex in Ziguinchor which treated and exported shrimp and other crustaceans and employed more than 2,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Following the cyclone's passage, the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society began {{dispatching}} relief teams, food, {{and other}} supplies to impacted areas. The Bangladesh Army and non-governmental organizations participated in both air- and water-borne relief operations, though inclement weather initially forced the suspension of several planned helicopter flights. Both the Bangladesh Navy and Indian Navy convened in the northern littoral of the Bay of Bengal {{to search for the}} thousands <b>of</b> <b>fishermen</b> and islanders that went missing during the tropical cyclone's landfall. Due to the wide scope of the disaster, the Bangladeshi government appealed for international aid, particularly from Japan and Canada as those countries had played large roles in the relief efforts of past Bangladeshi disasters. The Government of the Netherlands donated US$370,000for use in the relief efforts following the storm. Lord Glenarthur, then British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, toured effected areas in Bangladesh for three days before announcing a ₤200,000grant (US$370,000) to voluntary relief agencies assisting in cyclone relief operations. Then-Bangladeshi President Hussain Muhammad Ershad also visited the worst impacted districts, including Khulna and Bagerhat. Following these visits, Ershad's administration established a national disaster committee composed of relief specialists to coordinate relief and rehabilitation efforts.|$|E
5|$|In June 1832 Yagan led a {{party of}} Aborigines in attacking two labourers sowing a field of wheat {{alongside}} the Canning River near Kelmscott. One of the men, John Thomas, escaped, but the other, William Gaze, was wounded and later died as a result. The settlement declared Yagan an outlaw and offered a reward of £20 for his capture. He avoided capture until early October 1832. A group <b>of</b> <b>fishermen</b> enticed Yagan and two companions into their boat, then pushed off into deep water. The fishermen took the three Noongar men to the Perth guardhouse, from which they were transferred to the Round House at Fremantle. Yagan was sentenced to death, but he was saved by the intercession of settler Robert Lyon. Arguing that Yagan was defending his land against invasion, Lyon said Yagan {{should not be considered}} a criminal but a prisoner of war and suggested he should be treated as such. At the recommendation of John Septimus Roe, the Surveyor-General of Western Australia, Yagan and his men were exiled on Carnac Island under the supervision of Lyon and two soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, a {{thorough}} reading of historical newspaper articles and historical government reports {{reveals that the}} whole history of wild Murray cod between the mid–1800s and the mid–1900s was one of citizen agitation, government inaction, and ongoing stock decline. For decade after decade, riverside residents, commercial fishermen, recreational fishermen, local fisheries inspectors, fish retailers, and others agitated in newspapers and other fora about the evidently, continuously declining Murray cod stocks, to be met in turn either with government denials, or conversely, with various ineffective inquiries into Murray cod stocks and fisheries, and various ineffective control measures. For decade after decade, debate about excessive fishing pressure, number <b>of</b> <b>fishermen,</b> number of nets, net mesh size, bag limits, minimum size limits and take of small cod, closed seasons and the taking of spawning cod full of eggs during spring, and other sundry issues, raged on and on without proper resolution, with fishing regulations either not amended, or amended and largely unenforced and completely ignored, and with heavy commercial, recreational and illegal fishing pressure continuing unrelenting and unabated. The end result was a Murray cod population, initially unimaginably abundant, continually fished down and down and down without pause, until in the early to mid 20th century a number of other factors such as river regulation (listed below) emerged to drive the species even further into decline. All of these drivers of decline have left this iconic Australian fish in a perilous situation. There are now grave concerns for the long-term survival of wild Murray cod populations.|$|E
