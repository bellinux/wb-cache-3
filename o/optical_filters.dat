500|$|Prototype {{filters are}} {{electronic}} filter designs {{that are used}} as a template to produce a modified filter design for a particular application. [...] They are an example of [...] a nondimensionalised design from which the desired filter can be scaled or transformed. They are most often seen in regard to electronic filters and especially linear analogue passive filters.

40|$|There {{is a big}} {{need for}} {{standardizing}} signal quality tests of transmitters for 100 Gb/s PM-QPSK fiber optic communication systems. Such systems are currently being deployed and still, there is no standard for transmitter testing. Several approaches for doing this in an efficient manner have been proposed. These include different methods of detecting the signal and different approaches for filtering the signal. The signal can be sampled electrically or optically, both over- and undersampled. The choices of <b>filtering</b> range from <b>optical</b> and electrical hardware filters to filtering in digital signal processing. All filtering and sampling techniques are not compatible. The focus in this project will be on <b>optical</b> <b>filtering</b> {{that can be used}} together with optical sampling. The reason for using optical sampling is to achieve high measurement bandwidth. The only filtering technique which is easily applicable when sampling optically is <b>optical</b> <b>filtering.</b> This is because the signal is undersampled. The project is an exploratory study to investigate if optical sampling together with <b>optical</b> <b>filtering</b> is a good approach for signal quality testing. Experiments were made to assess the accuracy of <b>optical</b> <b>filtering</b> by measuring on QPSK signals and comparing to DSP filtered measurements. Impulse response measurements were also made to compare the impulse responses of an optically and DSP filtered system. Also, theoretical work has been done to determine the equivalence to <b>optical</b> <b>filtering</b> in the DSP domain. The accuracy of the <b>optical</b> <b>filtering</b> is found to be sufficient under certain conditions on the filter characteristics. It is found that <b>optical</b> <b>filtering</b> together with <b>optical</b> sampling is a viable method for fast and efficient transmitter testing. The <b>optical</b> <b>filtering</b> method should be included in future standardization studies as an alternative to DSP filtering used in real-time sampling approaches...|$|R

500|$|Up to 10% of the HST's {{observation}} time is {{designated as}} Director's Discretionary (DD) Time, and is typically awarded to astronomers {{who wish to}} study unexpected transient phenomena, such as supernovae.

A special Institute Advisory Committee recommended that the WFPC2 be used to image a [...] "typical" [...] patch of sky at a high galactic latitude, using several <b>optical</b> <b>filters.</b> A working group was set up to develop and implement the project.|$|E
500|$|Atomic line filters can be {{considered}} the optical equivalent of lock-in amplifiers; they are used in scientific applications requiring the effective detection of a narrowband signal (almost always laser light) {{that would otherwise be}} obscured by broadband sources, such as daylight. [...] They are used regularly in Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and are being studied for their potential use in laser communication systems. Atomic line filters are superior to conventional dielectric <b>optical</b> <b>filters</b> such as interference filters and Lyot filters, but their greater complexity makes them practical only in background-limited detection, where a weak signal is detected while suppressing a strong background. [...] Compared to etalons, another high-end optical filter, Faraday filters are significantly sturdier and may be six times cheaper at around US$15,000 per unit.|$|E
500|$|Without {{an atomic}} line filter, laser {{tracking}} and communication may be difficult. Usually, intensified charge-coupled device cameras {{must be used}} in conjunction with simple dielectric <b>optical</b> <b>filters</b> (e.g. interference filters) to detect laser emissions at a distance. Intensified CCDs are inefficient and necessitate the use of a pulsed laser transmission within the visible spectrum. With the superior filtering system of an ALF, a non-intensified CCD may be used with a continuous wave laser more efficiently. [...] " [...] with passbands of about 0.001nm have been developed to improve the background rejection of conventionally filtered laser receivers". The total energy consumption of the latter system is [...] "30 to 35 times less" [...] than that of the former, so space-based, underwater and agile laser communications with ALFs have been proposed and developed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An on-chip micro-droplet <b>optical</b> <b>filter</b> {{based on}} the {{evanescent}} wave coupling by fiber taper is presented in this paper. The <b>optical</b> <b>filter</b> consists of a T-junction for micro-droplets generation and an integrated optical fiber taper for light input and output. The light is coupled into the droplet resonator when {{it has the same}} wavelengths as the Whispering Gallery Modes (WGMs) of the droplet. The coupling efficiency can be adjusted by tuning the distance between the droplet and the fiber taper using micro fluidic flow. Compared with the solid sphere or ring <b>optical</b> <b>filter</b> using fiber taper coupling, the diameter and refractive index of liquid droplet can be easily tuned, which means the resonant modes can also be tuned. The diameter of the droplet is controlled by the flow rate ratio at the T-junction.
