An ongoing {{initiative}} is being made to put in plants which provide interest throughout the season or are at their best in the late summer. There are now many species and colours <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> and plenty of agapanthus, crinum, nerines and day lilies, together with such rarities as a Heptacodium and an Arbutus menziesii.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the McCartney {{family moved}} {{for the last}} time to a small three-bedroomed brick-built terrace house at 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, which is now owned by The National Trust. It only cost £1:6s:0d per week, which was due to Mary's {{seniority}} at the hospital. Before moving to Forthlin Road, Jim had been secretary of the Speke Horticultural Society, and had often sent his sons out to canvass for new members. Jim planted dahlias and snapdragons in the front garden of Forthlin Road and regularly trimmed the lavender hedge, although it was Paul's job to collect horse manure from the local streets in a bucket to be dug into the flowerbeds. As Jim was a heavy smoker, Jim would first dry and then crush sprigs <b>of</b> <b>Lavender</b> and then burn them (like incense) in the ashtrays to kill the smell of his cigarette smoke.|$|E

25|$|In {{the manner}} of Greek wine, Roman wine was often flavored with herbs and spices (similar to modern vermouth and mulled wine) and was {{sometimes}} stored in resin-coated containers, giving it a flavor similar to modern retsina. Romans were {{particularly interested in the}} aroma of wine and experimented with various methods of enhancing a wine's bouquet. One technique that gained some usage in southern Gaul was planting herbs such as lavender and thyme in the vineyards, believing that their flavors would pass through the ground and into the grapes. Modern-day wines from the Rhone are often characterized by using the aroma descriptors <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> and thyme, presumably as a reflection of the grape varieties used and the terroir. Another widespread practice was the storage of amphoras in a smoke chamber called a fumarium to add smokiness to a wine's flavor.|$|E

Some perianths and some coronas may also contain {{more than one}} colour or shade. Prevalent colours are all shades and tones of yellow, white, orange, pink, red and green.
