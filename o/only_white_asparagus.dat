5000|$|Asparagus is {{very popular}} in the Netherlands, Spain, France, Poland, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Turkey, Italy, and Switzerland, and is almost {{exclusively}} white; if not, it is specified by the local language term for [...] "green asparagus". <b>White</b> <b>asparagus</b> {{is the result of}} applying a blanching technique while the asparagus shoots are growing.

Compared to green asparagus, the locally cultivated so-called [...] "white gold" [...] or [...] "edible ivory" [...] asparagus, also referred to as [...] "the royal vegetable", is believed to be less bitter and much tenderer.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} genetic, pre-harvest (season of harvest, spear diameter, spear portion and spear tip color) and post-harvest factors (storage and {{domestic}} preparation practices, e. g., peeling and cooking) on total phenolic, flavonoid and ascorbic acid content of <b>white</b> <b>asparagus</b> spears and their correlation with antioxidant capacity (DPPH and FRAP) were studied. Results showed that genetic material {{was important for}} the total phenolic content but not season of harvest, spear diameter or storage. Violet spear tips and apical spear portions showed the largest amount of total phenolics. Peeling did not affect total phenolics in fresh asparagus, whereas it reduced their content in stored asparagus, while cooking resulted {{in an increase in}} both fresh and stored asparagus. However, the soluble extract of total phenolics and flavonoids were minor and the missing significance of phenolics and flavonoids in antioxidant capacity of <b>white</b> <b>asparagus</b> spears depends on these small amounts...|$|R

40|$|Sensory {{data were}} {{collected}} from ready-to-eat (RTE) cereal breakfast foods and asparagus using quantitative descriptive analysis. The collated data were subjected to univariate and multivariate statistical procedures. ^ Trained panelists using wide a array of RTE breakfast cereals generated 16 sensory descriptors covering appearance, texture, flavor and after-taste. ANOVA in conjunction with MANOVA of the RTE breakfast cereal data showed that each of seven panelist can proficiently discriminate between RTE cereal breakfast foods. Principal component analysis, based on panelists scores, effectively segregated 3 of the panelists and considered them as outliers. When scores of the outliers were deleted and the remaining data were pooled and subjected to ANOVA, 13 of the 16 descriptors were classified as discriminators. Factor analysis effectively reduced the 13 discriminators into 3 orthogonal factors with as little loss of information as possible. Finally based on the sensory characteristics of RTE cereal breakfast foods, discriminant analysis was able to group them into their respective sugar categories. ^ Quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) done on green and <b>white</b> (blanched) <b>asparagus</b> (Asparagus officinalis L.) by trained panelists generated 11 flavor descriptors which were categorized as aromatic, up-front taste and after-taste. Through factor analysis the 11 flavor descriptors were further reduced to five orthogonal factors namely Factor 1, component related to green and leafy vegetables, Factor 2, component related to yellow vegetables, Factor 3, the after-taste component, Factor 4, the sulfury component and Factor 5, the sweet pea component. ^ Slopes of individual panelists with time was used to determine who among the panelists were entirely different in their flavor perception. Deletion of panelists with completely different slopes reduced variability within treatment. ^ Repeated measures analysis of variance when applied to the harvest data, which was collected over 5 weeks, indicated that <b>white</b> <b>asparagus</b> has a higher after-taste component as well as sweet pea components. A 14 day storage study under refrigerated condition revealed that during storage both green and <b>white</b> <b>asparagus</b> developed grassy after-taste and meaty and brothy after-taste diminished. ...|$|R
