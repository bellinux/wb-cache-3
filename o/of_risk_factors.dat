5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, a number <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> {{for the development}} of cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not well understood.|$|E

40|$|Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) {{has emerged}} as a major cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in HIV-infected adults. Research in noninfected populations suggests that knowledge <b>of</b> CVD <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> significantly influences perception <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> Understanding the level <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> knowledge and <b>risk</b> perception can inform the development of innovative interventions to reduce <b>risk.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this study was to describe cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> knowledge and <b>risk</b> perception in a cohort of HIV-infected adults. Specific aims included (a) describing the estimated <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> CVD, the perceived <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> CVD, and the level <b>of</b> CVD <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> knowledge; (b) describing the relationship between estimated and perceived risk, and (c) examining the influence <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> knowledge on perceived <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> CVD.

5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Research {{findings}} suggest that the level <b>of</b> cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> recording in general practice is not yet optimal. Several studies indicate a relation between the organization of cardiovascular disease prevention at practice level and cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> recording. AIM: To explore the relation between the organization of cardiovascular disease prevention and <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> recording in general practice. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted using data on adherence to selected practice guidelines and on cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> recording from 95 general practices. Practice guidelines were developed beforehand in a consensus procedure. Adherence was assessed by means of a questionnaire and practice observations. <b>Risk</b> <b>factor</b> recording was assessed by an audit of 50 medical records per practice. RESULTS: <b>Factor</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> recording revealed three dimensions explaining 76 % of the variance: recording of health-related behaviour, recording of clinical parameters, and recording of medical background parameters. Adherence to the guideline 'proactively invite patients to attend for assessment of cardiovascular risk' was related to a higher recording level in all three dimensions. Practice characteristics did not show a consistent relationship to the level <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> recording. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the presence of a system of proactive invitation was related to the recording <b>of</b> cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> in medical records in general practice...|$|R
25|$|Several {{environmental}} risk {{factors have been}} proposed to {{support the hypothesis that}} the actual frequency of autism has increased. These include certain foods, infectious disease, pesticides. There is overwhelming scientific evidence against the MMR hypothesis and no convincing evidence for the thiomersal (or Thimerosal) hypothesis, so these types <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> have to be ruled out. Although it is unknown whether autism's frequency has increased, any such increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.|$|E

40|$|Background-—Cross-sectional {{clustering}} <b>of</b> metabolic <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> for {{cardiovascular disease}} in middle-aged adults is well described, but less is known regarding {{the order in}} which <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> develop through young adulthood and their relation to subclinical atherosclerosis. Method and Results-—A total of 3178 black and white women and men in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study were assessed to identify {{the order in which}} cardiovascular disease <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or high triglyceride levels), hypercholesterolemia (high total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and obesity develop. Observed patterns <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> development were compared with those expected if <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> accumulated randomly, given their overall distribution in the population. Over the 20 years of follow-up, 80 % of participants developed at least 1 <b>risk</b> <b>factor.</b> The first factor to occur was dyslipidemia in 39 % of participants, obesity in 20 %, hypercholesterolemia in 11 %, hypertension in 7 %, and diabetes in 1 %. Dyslipidemia was the only <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> both to occur first and to be followed by additional <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> more often than expected (P< 0. 001 for both). Order <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> accrual did not affect subclinical atherosclerosis at year 20. Results were similar by sex, race, and smoking status. Conclusions-—Multiple patterns <b>of</b> cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> development were observed from young adulthood to middle age. Dyslipidemia, a potentially modifiable condition, often preceded the development <b>of</b> other <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> and may be a useful target for intervention and monitoring.

In a study of four different tests to reduce the optimistic bias, researchers found that regardless of the attempts to reduce the bias, through lists <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> participants perceiving themselves as inferior to others, participants asked to think of high-risk individuals, and giving attributes of why they were at risk, all increased the bias rather than decreased it.

25|$|Fostering {{resilience}} {{in children}} requires family environments that are caring and stable, hold {{high expectations for}} children’s behavior and encourage participation {{in the life of}} the family. Most resilient children have a strong relationship with at least one adult, not always a parent, and this relationship helps to diminish risk associated with family discord. The definition of parental resilience, as the capacity of parents to deliver a competent and quality level of parenting to children, despite the presence <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> has proven to be a very important role in children's resilience. Understanding the characteristics of quality parenting is critical to the idea of parental resilience. Even if divorce produces stress, the availability of social support from family and community can reduce this stress and yield positive outcomes. Any family that emphasizes the value of assigned chores, caring for brothers or sisters, and the contribution of part-time work in supporting the family helps to foster resilience. Resilience research has traditionally focused on the well being of children, with limited academic attention paid to factors that may contribute to the resilience of parents.|$|E
