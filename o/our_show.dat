5|$|When Me and Juliet began tryout {{performances}} in Cleveland, the duo {{realized that the}} show had problems with the plot and staging. Extensive revisions during the remaining Cleveland and Boston tryouts failed to cure the difficulties with the plot, which the critics considered weak and uninteresting. The show was met with less than favorable reviews, though Mielziner's staging won praise from audience and critics. The show closed once it had exhausted its advance sales. According to Bill Hayes the show's star in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he says' We played nearly five hundred performances, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits went into the R till. So, though {{not in the same}} category as the storied five that were made into films - Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music - <b>our</b> <b>show</b> must be considered a success. With the exception of a short run in Chicago, there was no national tour, and the show has seldom been seen. A small-scale production was presented by London's Finborough Theatre in 2010.|$|E

500|$|While on [...] "The Asylum In-store Tour", Bruce and Utsler were {{informed}} by Abbiss {{that they were}} offered $100,000 to perform at Woodstock '99. They were excited about the offer, as it indicated {{their impact on the}} music industry. Some people perceived participating in Woodstock '99 was a sell-out for the group; however, Bruce and Utsler disagreed. As Bruce explains, [...] " [...] sold out the mainstream style for us! Woodstock never came to us and asked us to change one fuckin' thing about us or <b>our</b> <b>show!</b> They wanted ICP just as ICP is, and nothing else.

500|$|The show's writers {{reject the}} idea that The Daily Show has {{become a source of}} news for young people. Stewart argues that Americans are living in an [...] "age of {{information}} osmosis" [...] in which it is close to impossible to gain one's news from any single source, and says that his show succeeds comedically because the viewers already have some knowledge about current events. [...] "Our show would not be valuable to people who didn't understand the news because it wouldn't make sense," [...] he argues. [...] "We make assumptions about your level of knowledge that... if we were your only source of news, you would just watch <b>our</b> <b>show</b> and think, 'I don't know what's happening.'" ...|$|E

The episode achieved a 4.5/12 rating in the key 18–49 demographic among adults, and was the fourth highest-rated show of the evening; it subsequently achieved the show's highest rating ever in the 18–49 demographic.

[...] In his 1976 book, The Secret Word Is Groucho, he writes, [...] "Company sales, as a result of <b>our</b> <b>show,</b> had risen precipitously. Profits doubled in that brief time, and Esso felt guilty taking the money. So Esso dropped us after twenty-six weeks. Those were the days of guilt-edged securities, which don't exist today." ...|$|E

500|$|The Internet groups {{surrounding}} the fandom have enabled the show's producers to quickly assess their work; director and producer Jayson Thiessen stated [...] "As {{soon as the}} episode airs, I can go online and see people's responses in real time".

Despite this, {{the first episode}} of The Matty Johns Show was that day's most-watched program in Sydney with 396,000 viewers, and it {{collected}} another 199,000 viewers in Brisbane. Of the initial ratings, Johns said in a press statement, [...] "We’re humbled by the support for <b>our</b> <b>show...</b> Our aim was to produce a great fun footy show {{for the whole family}} and we’re glad people liked it." [...] Reporters Amanda Meade from The Australian and Michael Idato from The Sydney Morning Herald suggested after the first episode that the earlier timeslot gives The Matty Johns Show a ratings advantage over The Footy Show.

500|$|Despite the {{critical}} success, the third season of Parks and Recreation continued to suffer in the Nielsen ratings, {{just as it}} had during the second season. The average viewership for the 16 episodes of season three were 4.75 million household viewers, a slight increase over season two's 4.68 million average, but lower than season one's average of 5.45 million households. Michael Schur partially attributed the continually low viewership to a decline in ratings for NBC in general, as well as changing viewer trends due to a large amount of available channels. He added: [...] "I would love it if our ratings went up and up, and we've done {{a pretty good job of}} making <b>our</b> <b>show</b> inviting and friendly, welcoming to new viewers. Other than that, I'm not sure what else we can do. It’s very disconcerting." ...|$|E

500|$|Every so often, I’d get a {{call from}} the {{producer}} saying, it’s going out at this time. The publicity people would be alerted, then we’d {{get a call}} saying no, it’s not, it’s been put back. That happened six times, I think, altogether – seven reschedules in a year or so... It was extraordinary and inexplicable, and just one of these things that happen.

500|$|The {{season finale}} {{of the second}} season {{introduced}} the parallel universe to viewers. Fringes producers debated over {{how much of this}} universe to depict in the third season, but ultimately decided that showing the doppelgangers would [...] "fit more into our own character’s lives and show different aspects of their personalities". As a result, Fringe began its third season by alternating between episodes, with each depicting one universe. The Fox network was initially resistant to this design, as executives were [...] "really concerned that if the episodes didn't have [...] Walter or Peter in them, it wouldn’t feel like <b>our</b> <b>show</b> anymore." [...] Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman explained that the series had to constantly evolve, [...] "otherwise we’ll get bored, the cast will get bored, the audience will get bored"; after the first several episodes of the season, Fox agreed it was a positive change.|$|E

[...] The mean way Damien is treated by his fellow students when he joins the school, as well as Damien's reactions to the treatment, were inspired by Parker's experience of the second grade, when he started at a Cheyenne, Wyoming elementary school in the last three weeks of the school year.
