5|$|Decrease in the {{population}} of the addax has begun notably since the mid-1800s. More recently, addax were found from Algeria to Sudan, but due mainly to <b>overhunting,</b> they have become much more restricted and rare.|$|E
5|$|The meat, oil, bones, and skins are {{valuable}} items sold in markets. Mortality is often caused by direct hunting by humans or other human-induced causes, such as habitat destruction, entanglement in fishing gear, and watercraft collisions. Steller's sea cow went extinct due to <b>overhunting</b> in 1768.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} cited human threat to birds is habitat loss. Other threats include <b>overhunting,</b> accidental mortality due to collisions with buildings or vehicles, long-line fishing bycatch, pollution (including oil spills and pesticide use), competition and predation from nonnative invasive species, and climate change.|$|E

5|$|The mallard is {{considered}} an invasive species in New Zealand, where it competes with the local New Zealand grey duck, which was <b>overhunted</b> in the past. There, and elsewhere, mallards are spreading with increasing urbanisation and hybridising with local relatives.|$|R
5000|$|The Chinese goral (Nemorhaedus griseus), {{also known}} as the grey long-tailed goral, is a species of goral, a small goat-like ungulate, native to mountainous regions of Myanmar, China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, and {{possibly}} Laos. In some parts of its range, it is <b>overhunted.</b> The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as a [...] "vulnerable species".|$|R
5|$|Once {{widespread}} in Southeast Asia, the Javan rhinoceros was presumed extinct in Vietnam in the mid-1970s, {{at the end}} of the Vietnam War. The combat wrought havoc on the ecosystems of the region through use of napalm, extensive defoliation from Agent Orange, aerial bombing, use of landmines, and <b>overhunting</b> by local poachers.|$|E
5|$|The trade's {{boom years}} ended around 1810, after which a long decline {{was marked by}} {{increasing}} economic diversification. By 1810, the supply of sea otter pelts had fallen due to <b>overhunting.</b> American trade declined during the War of 1812, but after 1815, Americans were able to resume and expand the maritime fur trade, and continued to dominate.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{when the}} King Island emu was still {{thought to be}} only known from prehistoric remains, James Greenway {{questioned}} whether {{they could have been}} exterminated by a few natives, and speculated that fires started by prehistoric men or lightning may have been responsible. At this time, the mainland emu was also threatened by <b>overhunting,</b> and Greenway cautioned that it could end up sharing the fate of its island relatives if no measures were taken in time.|$|E
5000|$|... 45 {{species of}} reptile have been recorded, but the mugger {{crocodile}} (Crocodylus palustris), has been <b>overhunted</b> {{and is no}} longer present, and the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is much reduced in numbers. There are 11 species of amphibian and more than 120 species of fish. Crustaceans are abundant, especially fiddler crabs and mud crabs, as well as lobsters, shrimps and prawns.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} reasons for the {{apparent}} discordance between past and projected population trends: estimates from the 1950s and 1960s were based on stories from explorers and hunters rather than on scientific surveys. Second, controls of harvesting were introduced that allowed this previously <b>overhunted</b> species to recover. Third, the recent {{effects of climate change}} have affected sea ice abundance in different areas to varying degrees.|$|R
25|$|Although the Upper Peninsula {{nominally}} became United States territory {{with the}} 1783 Treaty of Paris, the British {{did not give}} up control until 1797 under terms of the Jay Treaty. As an American territory, the Upper Peninsula was still dominated by the fur trade. John Jacob Astor founded the American Fur Company on Mackinac Island in 1808; however, the industry began to decline in the 1830s as beaver and other game were <b>overhunted.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the Amazon basin, when caimans became scarce as {{a result}} of <b>overhunting</b> in the mid-20th century, the number of local fish, such as the {{important}} arapaima (Arapaima gigas), also decreased. These are nutrient-poor waters, and the urine and faeces of the caimans may have increased primary production by contributing plant nutrients. Thus the presence of the reptiles could have benefited the fish stock; the number of crocodilians in a stretch of water appears to be correlated with the fish population.|$|E
5|$|Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: {{sagebrush}} {{and several}} species of cactus are interspersed with dry scrub forests of piñon and juniper, the latter primarily on the mesa tops. The canyon is far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the temperate coniferous forests plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, <b>overhunting,</b> habitat destruction, and drought may have led the Chacoans to strip the canyon of wild plants and game. It {{has been suggested that}} even during wet periods the canyon was able to sustain only 2,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Other animals became locally extinct through <b>overhunting.</b> The last elk in Pennsylvania {{was killed}} in Elk County in 1867. The Pennsylvania Game Commission brought 177 animals from the Rocky Mountains to the state from 1913 to 1926; today the elk herd of over 600 animals can often be seen in Quehanna Wild Area. Between 1906 and 1925, Pennsylvania became so {{concerned}} about declining numbers of white-tailed deer that it imported nearly 1,200animals from Michigan to re-establish the species, and made it the official state animal in 1959. In the early 21st century, over-grazing by deer threatens plant diversity. By the early 20th century, the fisher, a small mammal similar to the European polecat or American marten, was hunted to extinction in Pennsylvania. Between 1994 and 1998, 190animals were released in five sites {{in the northern part}} of the state, including 23animals along Quehanna's Wykoff Run in 1995. Breeding populations of fisher appear to have been reestablished.|$|E
50|$|The {{bay duiker}} prefers old-growth or primary forests. It has been {{historically}} <b>overhunted</b> across its range for bushmeat. The {{survival of the}} bay duiker is also threatened by human settlement and agricultural expansion due to this duiker's preference for old-growth forests, and habitat degradation. The bay duiker is, however, still a common duiker species, and is classified as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).|$|R
50|$|The WMA {{dates from}} 1947, when the State of Oklahoma {{purchased}} and established it as a deer preserve. At the time, the state's deer herd had been <b>overhunted</b> and {{had dropped to}} less than 500 animals. The state wildlife department nurtured a herd of native deer in the WMA and began exporting it {{to other parts of}} Oklahoma. The effort was very successful, and controlled hunts were allowed in its territory by the 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|The gharial {{population}} {{is estimated to}} have declined from 5,000-10,000 individuals in 1946 to fewer than 235 individuals alive in 2006, a decline of 96-98% within three generations. They were killed by fishermen, <b>overhunted</b> for skins, trophies and indigenous medicine, and their eggs collected for consumption. Today, the remaining individuals form several fragmented subpopulations. Hunting is no longer considered a significant threat. However, the wild population of gharials declined by about 58% between 1997 and 2006 because: ...|$|R
5|$|P. l. mesopotamica or Mesopotamian lion, flourished {{during the}} Neo-Assyrian Period (approximately 1000–600 BC). It {{inhabited}} the Mesopotamian Plain where it probably represents a distinct sub-species. Nearly all ancient Mesopotamian representations of male lions demonstrate full underbelly hair in which until recently was only {{identified in the}} Barbary lion (Panthera leo leo) from Northern Africa and in most Asiatic lions (P. l. persica) from captivity in colder climates. Ancient evidence from adjacent landmasses reveal no substantiation for lions with underbelly hair in this manner so that the distinct phenotype of depicted lions in ancient Mesopotamia (including Babylon, Elam and ancient Persia) represent an extinct sub-species. Many of the images of these lions are derived from lion hunting sculptures so that the extinction of this sub-species likely resulted from <b>overhunting</b> {{in the ancient world}} (See the Cultural significance below).|$|E
5|$|Pigs {{and goats}} were {{released}} {{on the island}} as potential food in the early 1800s, the goats destroying shrubs and grasses used as nesting sites and the pigs eating eggs and chicks and disturbing the land by nuzzling for food. Several birds have become extinct on the island since the arrival of humans. The first round of extinctions included the Lord Howe swamphen or white gallinule, white-throated pigeon, red-crowned parakeet and the Tasman booby, which were eliminated by visitors and settlers {{during the nineteenth century}} either from <b>overhunting</b> for food or protection of crops. Black rats were released from provisioning whaling ships in the 1840s and mice from Norfolk Island in 1860. In 1918 the black rat was accidentally introduced with the shipwreck of the SS Makambo which ran aground at Ned's Beach. This triggered a second wave of extinctions, including the vinous-tinted thrush, robust white-eye, Lord Howe starling, Lord Howe fantail and the Lord Howe gerygone as well as the destruction of the native phasmid and decimation of palm fruits. Bounties were offered for rat and pig tails and 'ratting' became a popular pursuit. Subsequent poisoning programs have kept populations low. The Lord Howe boobook may have become extinct through predation by, or competition with, the Tasmanian masked owls which were introduced in the 1920s in a failed attempt to control the rat population. Stray dogs are also a threat as they could harm the native wood hen and other birds.|$|E
25|$|Deer, {{wild boar}} and jackal are common at the area. Wolves, lynx, brown bears and big cats once roamed there, but now {{disappeared}} from the mountains due to <b>overhunting.</b>|$|E
500|$|In the United States, the American crocodile's only {{habitat is}} within South Florida. They were once <b>overhunted</b> for their hides. They are {{protected}} today from hunting, {{but are still}} threatened due to habitat destruction and injury from vehicle collisions when crossing roads to reach waterways. About 1,000 crocodiles live in Florida and there are roughly 50 nests in the Everglades and Biscayne National Parks. Crocodiles populations in South Florida have increased as has the number of alligators. Crocodiles were reclassified from [...] "endangered" [...] to [...] "threatened" [...] in the United States in 2007.|$|R
50|$|Pudús are {{threatened}} {{due to the}} destruction of their rainforest habitat. The land is cleared for human development, cattle ranching, agriculture, logging, and exotic tree plantations.Habitat fragmentation and road accidents cause pudú deaths. They are taken from the wild as pets, as well as exported illegally.They are <b>overhunted</b> and killed for food by specially trained hunting dogs.The recently introduced red deer compete with pudús for food. Domestic dogs prey upon pudús and transfer parasites through contact. Pudús are very susceptible to diseases such as bladder worms, lungworms, roundworms, and heartworms.|$|R

25|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, wild turkeys were exterminated {{in the state}} through <b>overhunting</b> and {{destruction}} of habitat. Sixteen were re-introduced in 1969 and had grown to an estimated flock of 45,000 in 2009. in 2013, hunters killed 6,968 of these.|$|E
25|$|Due to hide hunting, pollution, loss of habitat, {{and removal}} of adults for {{commercial}} farming, the American crocodile is endangered {{in parts of}} its range.

25|$|Colonization had a {{significant}} impact on First Nations diet and health. According to the historian Mary-Ellen Kelm, “inadequate reserve allocations, restrictions on the food fishery, <b>overhunting,</b> and over-trapping” alienated First Nations from their traditional way of life, which undermined their physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health.|$|E
5000|$|Waterfowl on Réunion were <b>overhunted.</b> As {{early as}} 1667, François Martin complained of {{unsustainable}} hunting. The last {{record of the}} species is a 1709 listing of de la Merveille who stated that ducks and geese occurred [...] "in quantity", but as Jean Feuilley had not listed waterfowl in his 1705 catalogue of Réunion's animals, de la Merveille's record is obviously based on obsolete hearsay information. Thus, the last record of the species {{appears to be the}} report of Père Bernardin in 1687. The species probably became extinct during the 1690s.|$|R

5|$|Greenway {{suggested}} {{that both the}} French settlers and their slaves ate the Guadeloupe amazon, as well as destroying its habitat. The supposedly related imperial amazon survives in the steep mountain forests of Dominica, whereas Guadeloupe is less mountainous and more suitable for farming, and has a larger population of humans. Because of this, {{there would have been}} a greater pressure on the Guadeloupe amazon, and it appears to have become extinct by the end of the 18th century. The amazons still surviving on the West Indian islands are all endangered since they are trapped for the pet-trade, <b>overhunted</b> for food, and because of destruction of their habitat.|$|R
25|$|In March 1868, Wayanda {{was ordered}} to the newly {{acquired}} territory of Alaska to conduct {{a survey of the}} coastline and to discourage the <b>overhunting</b> of Northern fur seals in the Pribilof Islands.

In 1803, when Zashiversk lost its former economic significance as a marketplace, the uezd was abolished, and all government functions relocated to Verkhoyansk.|$|E
50|$|The Mississippian people {{abandoned}} the site long before European contact. No {{one knows why}} the civilization declined, but scholars have speculated that an extended regional drought reduced the maize surpluses that had enabled the concentration of population. In addition, the people may have <b>overhunted,</b> as well as reducing forests by their consumption of wood for the stockade, houses and fires. Archaeologists theorize that {{with the collapse of}} the chiefdom by 1450, many of the Angel people had relocated downriver to the confluence of the Ohio and Wabash rivers. A new Late Mississippian cultural group subsequently emerged and have been named by archeologists as the Caborn-Welborn culture.|$|R
5000|$|At Pleistocene Park, Zimov is {{attempting}} to recreate the Pleistocene grasslands {{to demonstrate that the}} grasslands would have persisted into the Holocene if humans did not <b>overhunt</b> the herds of Pleistocene herbivores which roamed and maintained the ecosystem. He has demonstrated that grasses take over the landscape 1-2 years after mosses are anthropogenically removed. [...] According to Zimov, re-introducing large herbivores to Siberia would initiate a positive feedback loop promoting the reestablishment of grassland ecosystems: [...] "The animals, their hooves, they disturb the moss and let grasses grow instead. The soil dries out, the animals deposit their fertilizer, the grass grows more, and more animals can graze." ...|$|R
