5|$|Both clubs {{having been}} {{eliminated}} from the FA Cup, Small Heath arranged a friendly with Notts County, refereed by the Test cricketer and former England international footballer Billy Gunn, which gave them an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> out reserve players Jack Jones and Alec Leake. On a hard, snow-covered pitch, Billy Walton scored all three goals in a 3–3 draw, but the attendance of under a thousand, though understandable because of the weather conditions, was disappointing. Jones made his competitive debut, standing in for the injured Hallam, as Small Heath again struggled in muddy conditions and, {{for the fourth time}} this season, lost to West Bromwich Albion.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Longue-Pointe was {{an attempt}} by Ethan Allen and a small force of American and Quebec militia to capture Montreal from British forces on September 25, 1775, early in the American Revolutionary War. Allen, who had been {{instructed}} only to raise militia forces among the local inhabitants, had long had thoughts of taking the lightly defended city. When he reached the southern shore of the St. Lawrence River with about 110 men, he seized the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>try.</b> Major John Brown, who Allen claimed was supposed to provide additional forces, did not appear as they had planned, isolating Allen and his men {{on the north side}} of the river.|$|E
5|$|In October of {{the same}} year, Müller's regular {{appearances}} for Bayern's first team caused Germany national team manager Joachim Löw to publicly consider him for a call-up, despite initial reluctance from the Bayern Munich board; the following month, Müller was named in the squad for a friendly against the Ivory Coast. However, this coincided {{with the death of}} national team goalkeeper Robert Enke, which led to the cancellation of a match against Chile the same week. With less <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> out new players, and with the under-21 team facing crucial qualifiers for the 2011 European Championship, Löw and under-21 manager Rainer Adrion felt that Müller was needed at the under-21 level, and Müller was called back into the under-21s.|$|E

25|$|That 1936-37 tour {{had proved}} a fairly chastening {{experience}} for England, {{who won the}} first two Tests but lost the final three, and so failed to regain The Ashes. The England selectors used the 1937 Test series against New Zealand as an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> out new players: Len Hutton and Denis Compton were among those who made their Test debuts in the series.|$|E
25|$|John Adams, a Federalist, {{defeated}} Jefferson in the 1796 election. War loomed with France and the Federalists {{used the}} <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to silence the Republicans with the Alien and Sedition Acts, {{build up a}} large army with Hamilton at the head, and prepare for a French invasion. However, the Federalists became divided after Adams sent a successful peace mission to France that ended the Quasi-War of 1798.|$|E

25|$|A {{low-cost}} denture {{starts at}} about $300–$500 per denture, or $600–$1,000 {{for a complete}} set of upper and lower dentures. These tend to be cold cured dentures, which are considered temporary because of the lower quality materials and streamlined processing methods used in their manufacture. In many cases, there is no <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> them on for fit before they are finished. They also tend to look artificial and not as natural as higher quality, higher priced dentures.|$|E

25|$|With David II in his custody, Edward III {{had a good}} <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> {{to reach}} terms, though Edward Balliol's {{interests}} were a sticking point. He had evidently prepared to overlook them {{by the time he}} made his first offer, in 1348, which seems to have been that David II would hold Scotland as a fief for England, naming Edward III or one of his sons as his successor, should he die without children. This had altered somewhat by 1350 when Edward III sent Douglas of Liddelsdale, also in custody in the Tower of London, to see if the Scots would be willing to take different terms: to ransom David II for a fee of £40,000, the restoration of the disinherited lords, and the naming of Edward III's young son John of Gaunt as David's successor, should he die without children. David himself is credited with removing Edward III's name from the line of succession in Scotland, and the Scots seem to have been willing to entertain the idea as they sent Douglas of Liddesdale back for further negotiation and David II was himself permitted to briefly return to Scotland in early 1352 to try to seal the deal. Stewart would obviously be disinclined to support terms that removed him from succession, but he seems ultimately not to have been alone. The Parliament convened in March 1352 did not find the prospect of submitting to the English a fair trade for the freedom of their king. David II was sent back.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies in}} the United States suggest that male-female {{differences}} in the prevalence of drug use may result from sex differences in <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> use drugs rather than from dif-ferences in the likelihood of making a transition into drug use once an opportunity has oc-curred. That is, men have more <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> drugs, but women appear {{to be just as}} likely as men to initiate drug use when given the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> do so. This paper examines whether this general observation holds for subgroups defined by age or birth cohort, race/eth-nicity, geographic region, and urban status. We analyzed data from the 1991, 1992, and 1993 National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse. We found general consistency across the sub-groups studied. Males were more likely than females <b>to</b> have <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> use drugs, but the sexes were equally likely to make a transition into drug use once an <b>opportunity</b> had oc-curred <b>to</b> <b>try</b> a drug. The implications of this evidence are discussed in relation to the epi-demiology and prevention of drug use and with respect to future research on sex and gender differences in drug involvement. 79...|$|R

At the third round, Tamura tried a Kimura lock, and althoough he couldn't twist the arm, he stretched it. Tokoro refused to tap out, but the match was eventually called off by submission.|$|R

5000|$|An {{investigation}} of the provenance of the paintings was spurred by {{a visit to the}} Confederation Centre by Daly's great grandson, Richard Jenkins. Paige Matthie, who curated the exhibit, discovered through her research that the attributions to the men were not well founded, and that one of them was not even known as a painter. Matthie comments that in an era of limited opportunities for Victorian women, [...] "It is wonderful that Daly seized <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> new things with her work, painting the interior of her ship's cabin on the voyage to Australia, or copying the work of male artists who were able to go into the wilderness to capture the sublime beauty of Canada." ...|$|R

500|$|Much of {{the album}} was {{formulated}} during [...] "vibe sessions" [...] in which the group and producers would visit clubs in downtown Atlanta, select performers they saw, and invite them to the studio.

However, recording sessions became difficult as André 3000 grew tired of rapping on songs, which made Big Boi and the producers uneasy about how the music would sound.

500|$|A mixed {{review was}} given by Andy Gill of The Independent who said that [...] "the vocal editing on 'Start Over' is far too sloppy, {{confirming}} again that a series of individual flourishes doesn't pass muster as a performance."

[...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also gave a mixed review for the song, saying: [...] "While the other songs on 4 all have a distinct flavor and give Beyoncé an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> something new {{in some way or}} another, 'Start Over' just kind of sits there at the middle of the disc not doing much of anything."
