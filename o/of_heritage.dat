5|$|Having been vocal in criticising Playford for sacrificing {{heritage}} to {{the march}} of development, Dunstan was prominent in protecting historic buildings from being bulldozed for high-rise office blocks. In 1972, the government intervened to purchase and thereby save Edmund Wright House on King William Street from being replaced with a skyscraper. In 1975, the Customs House at Semaphore was purchased to save it from demolition. His support <b>of</b> <b>heritage</b> preservation overlapped with his promotion of gourmet dining when his personal efforts helped to save the historic Ayers House on North Terrace, having it converted into a restaurant to avoid demolition. In contrast, there were also some controversial developments. Part of the rocky Hallett Cove on Gulf St Vincent in Adelaide's southern suburbs was developed for housing, as were vineyards in Morphettville, Tea Tree Gully, Modbury, and Reynella. This attracted criticism, as Dunstan was prominent in promoting South Australian viticulture and enotourism.|$|E
5|$|Heritage turkey breeds {{have been}} a focus for the {{organization}} since 1997, when a survey showed only 1,335 breeding stock birds of all breeds. A {{study conducted by the}} Conservancy and Virginia Tech concluded that heritage turkey breeds had stronger immune systems than those breeds typically used by industrial growers, and as such were more likely to survive disease epidemics. This study and other programs increased awareness <b>of</b> <b>heritage</b> turkey breeds and by 2003 the breeding population stood at 4,275 turkeys of all breeds. By 2007 this had grown to more than 10,000 birds and 17 breeds were no longer considered to be almost extinct. As of 2010, the number is estimated to be close to 15,000.|$|E

5|$|The Old National Library Building was a {{historical}} building at Stamford Road in the Museum Planning Area of Singapore. Originally completed in 1960, it housed the National Library {{and was a}} national icon for many Singaporeans. Despite a huge groundswell of public dissent, the library was closed on 31 March 2004, and was demolished {{to make way for}} the construction of the Fort Canning Tunnel to ease road traffic to the city.

5|$|The current Causeway bridges were {{designed}} by E W C Godfrey, and built between 1947 and 1952. They were the first in Western Australia to use steel composite construction. Large roundabouts were also constructed {{at each end of}} the structure, to improve the flow of traffic. The opening of the Graham Farmer Freeway in 2000 reduced the traffic volume on the Causeway, allowing the two central lanes to be turned into bus lanes. By the early 2000s, the concrete structures had suffered significant damage. Cracks were repaired using carbon fibre reinforcement and localised patching, extending the bridge's life by decades. The Causeway bridges have been recognised for their heritage value by their entry on the Western Australian Register <b>of</b> <b>Heritage</b> Places.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} {{originally planned}} to film the teaser sequence at a Catholic hospital, but {{the hospital was}} reluctant to affix a faux gargoyle to the building. Thus, the shot was relocated to Heritage Hall, a noted filming location and former post office in Vancouver. Some last minute scrambling was required when city workmen tore up the sidewalk on the very spot where the producers planned to film the scene. The construction crew reassured the show that the construction would be finished in time for filming. Indeed, the work was finished two hours before shooting of the episode started. Additional exterior shots were filmed at an alley near Bonanza Meat Market. The walls were painted to match those <b>of</b> <b>Heritage</b> Hall, although after filming was completed, they were returned to their original state.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognition}} of Buckeyes in the Standard {{has been a}} significant factor in its survival. In the past, largely due its lack of color variations, the Buckeye has not been an especially popular exhibition breed, but there is growing interest in the exhibition poultry fancy for this dual-purpose variety of bird. Not adopted by commercial operations, the Buckeye has generally been a bird of smaller farm flocks. Today the breed status is listed as threatened by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, threatened being defined as: Fewer than 1,000 breeding birds in the United States, with seven or fewer primary breeding flocks, and estimated global population less than 5,000. The breed is also included in the Slow Food USA Ark of Taste, a catalog <b>of</b> <b>heritage</b> foods in danger of extinction.|$|E
5|$|When the Japanese {{surrendered}} in 1945, Japanese business {{enterprises and}} organisations in Palau closed, effectively ending the Japanese influence on Palau's economy. In {{the first two}} decades after the war, the American occupation government imposed strict trade restrictions with Japan. Contact with Japan was reestablished in the 1960s, starting with Okinawan fishermen who were granted fishing rights. Japanese tourists began to visit Palau in increasing numbers from the mid-1970s. The growing influx of tourists to Palau led to the restoration <b>of</b> <b>heritage</b> sites around Palau, particularly memorial sites and administrative buildings built in the Japanese era as well as Palauan longhouses to accommodate {{to the interests of}} Japanese tourists, which accounted for half of all visiting tourists. Many of Palau's tourist sites were run and maintained by Palauan citizens of Japanese-Palauan heritage, whose knowledge in Japanese and Palauan customs and languages helped to facilitate tour groups consisting of Japanese tourists.|$|E
