25|$|Black {{light is}} used {{extensively}} in non-destructive testing. Fluorescing fluids {{are applied to}} metal structures and illuminated with a black light which allows cracks and other weaknesses in the material to be easily detected. It {{is also used to}} illuminate pictures painted with fluorescent colors, particularly on black velvet, which intensifies the illusion of self-illumination. The use of such materials, often in the form of tiles viewed in a sensory room under UV light, is common in the United Kingdom for the education of students with profound and multiple learning difficulties. Such fluorescence from certain textile fibers, especially those bearing <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> residues, can also be used for recreational effect, as seen, for example, in the opening credits of the James Bond film A View to a Kill. Black light puppetry is also performed in a black light theater.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescent {{compounds}} {{are often}} used to enhance the appearance of fabric and paper, causing a [...] "whitening" [...] effect. A white surface treated with an <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> can emit more visible light than that which shines on it, making it appear brighter. The blue light emitted by the brightener compensates for the diminishing blue of the treated material and changes the hue away from yellow or brown and toward white. Optical brighteners are used in laundry detergents, high brightness paper, cosmetics, high-visibility clothing and more.|$|E

40|$|A spectrofluorometric {{method was}} {{established}} {{and used to}} detect and quantify <b>optical</b> <b>brighteners</b> (OB) in ambient water samples. <b>Optical</b> <b>brighteners</b> are added to products such as laundry soaps, detergents, and cleaning agents {{for the purpose of}} making the fabric appear brighter after washing. Because a large fraction of OBs are discharged into wastewater, they are ideal for use as indicators of failing septic systems, sewage leaks, or lack of wastewater treatment. The method described here uses moderately priced equipment to provide rapid and accurate detection of minute levels of contamination. Standard curves were prepared with disodium diaminostilbene disulfonate solutions ranging in concentration from 0. 3 ppm to 70 ppm. Linear plots with R 2 values of ≥ 0. 987 were obtained for the standard curves, which were then used to determine the concentration of <b>optical</b> <b>brighteners</b> in water samples...|$|R

5000|$|The {{ultraviolet}} {{activity of}} umbelliferone {{led to its}} use as a sunscreen agent, and an <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> for textiles.

5000|$|Optical brighteners {{have also}} found use in cosmetics. One {{application}} is to formulas for washing and conditioning grey or blonde hair, where the brightener can not only increase the luminance and sparkle of the hair, but can also correct dull, yellowish discoloration without darkening the hair. Some advanced face and eye powders contain <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> microspheres that brighten shadowed or dark areas of the skin, such as [...] "tired eyes".|$|E
50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>brightener</b> {{is used to}} make paper appear whiter. Optical-brightening agents use {{fluorescence}} {{to absorb}} invisible radiation from the ultraviolet part of the light spectrum and re-emit the radiation as light in the visible blue range. The optical-brightening agent thus generates blue light that {{is added to the}} reflected light. The additional blue light offsets the yellowish tinge that would otherwise exist in the reflected light characteristics. It thus increases the brightness of the material (when the illumination includes ultraviolet radiation).|$|E
50|$|The major {{components}} of laundry detergents is anionic surfactants, alkaline builders, water softening agents and anti re deposition agents. Higher end detergents contain enzymes and <b>optical</b> <b>brighteners.</b> Some liquid detergents contain non ionic surfactants.|$|R

5000|$|Some {{materials}} {{can be made}} to look [...] "whiter than white", this is achieved using <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> agents (OBA). These are chemical compounds that absorb light in the ultraviolet and violet region (usually 340-370 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum, and re-emit light in the blue region (typically 420-470 nm). OBAs are often used in paper and clothing to create an impression of very bright white. This {{is due to the fact}} that the materials actually send out more visible light than they receive.|$|E

The authors have developed and tested a promising method to identify <b>optical</b> <b>brighteners</b> in sewer systems using inexpensive passive samplers and a simple analysis method. The method is used to identify large areas of four sewer systems which are polluted with misconnection discharge.

Detection of the covert infection was dependent on insect life stage and the viral mRNA used for diagnosis. Baculoviruses are virulent pathogens of insects, especially Lepidoptera, that form the basis for several biological insecti-cides (16). Baculovirus infections usually kill the host but may also survive as sublethal covert infections (17) and transmit themselves vertically, from parent to offspring (3, 10, 11, 14). Stilbene optical brighteners increase the probability of virus infection by inhibiting chitin synthesis (1, 7), thus increasing the permeability of the midgut peritrophic membrane (21), and by reducing the rate of turnover of infected gut cells (22). We hypothesized that the <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> Tinopal UNPA-GX (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), administered in mixture...|$|E
