5|$|Fearing {{that the}} U.S. troops {{were on the}} verge of {{breaking}} through their defenses, Hyakutake's 17th Army headquarters hurriedly sent whatever troops could be found <b>on-hand</b> to bolster the 4th Infantry's defensive efforts. The troops included the 2d Anti-Tank Gun Battalion with 12 guns and the 39th Field Road Construction Unit. These two units took position in pre-prepared fighting emplacements around the south and west of Point Cruz.|$|E
5|$|During the 1906 {{legislative}} session, Beckham urged {{investigation and}} prosecution of corrupt insurance companies, {{following the lead of}} New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes. In particular, he recommended reducing the practice of deferred dividends, which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash <b>on-hand</b> for illegal purposes. He further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky, bolstering the its economy and providing policyholders some protection against fraud.|$|E
5|$|A crew of over 200 craftspeople and {{technicians}} constructed the three principal sets: {{the surface of}} the alien planetoid, and the interiors of the Nostromo and the derelict spacecraft. Art Director Les Dilley created -scale miniatures of the planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made moulds and casts and scaled them up as diagrams for the wood and fiberglass forms of the sets. Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass, rock, and gravel were shipped into the studio to sculpt a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface, which the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes. The suits themselves were thick, bulky, and lined with nylon, had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled carbon dioxide to escape. Combined with a heat wave, these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out: nurses had to be kept <b>on-hand</b> with oxygen tanks.|$|E
5|$|Construction on Intimidator began {{during the}} summer of 2009 with land {{clearing}} and footings being constructed. Track pieces first began to arrive at Carowinds on August 7, 2009. About 3 weeks later, Intimidator was officially announced on August 26, 2009 by Carowinds. Along with the announcement, Carowinds reached a licensing agreement with Dale Earnhardt, Inc. to utilize the Dale Earnhardt brand as part of the ride. One of Earnhardt's sons, Kerry Earnhardt, was <b>on-hand</b> for the press conference announcing the attraction and endorsed the ride on behalf of the family. The first supports and track for Intimidator were installed on September 1, 2009. The lift hill was erected on October 1, 2009 and was completed on October 13, 2009. In order to install the last lift piece, 3 cranes were required. Construction on the roller coaster layout continued through November and December with the final track piece installed on December 21, 2009. Construction on the station, mechanics, and landscaping of Intimidator took place during the months of January and February. On February 4, 2010, testing of Intimidator commenced with the new roller coaster officially opening to the public on March 27, 2010.|$|E
25|$|Business models, {{including}} Just in Time (JIT) Inventory, Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) and Customer Managed Inventory (CMI), {{attempt to}} minimize <b>on-hand</b> inventory and increase inventory turns. VMI and CMI have gained considerable attention {{due to the}} success of third-party vendors who offer added expertise and knowledge that organizations may not possess.|$|E
25|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Grand Final there is a presentation ceremony where the winning team are awarded premiership rings. The player judged to be the man-of-the-match by the Australian national team selectors is awarded the prestigious Clive Churchill Medal and the Prime Minister of Australia is typically <b>on-hand</b> to hand the trophy to the winning captain.|$|E
25|$|During his {{childhood}} Iuzzini's palate was nourished by the fresh vegetables that were grown in his mother's garden, developing a special love for rhubarb and Concord grapes. Often cooking for the family, Iuzzini experimented with box cake recipes where he often added ingredients <b>on-hand</b> to make genuinely unique desserts. Enrolled {{in a high}} school vocational-technical program studying culinary arts, Iuzzini seemed destined for a career as a chef.|$|E
25|$|Angered by the council's {{continuing}} {{demands for}} improvements, Miller declared {{he would not}} seek additional economic concessions from the employers but only non-economic improvements. National stockpiles of coal were somewhat high, so a winter-time heating crisis never emerged. However, the ongoing effects of the 1973 oil crisis had greatly enhanced the demand for coal, and steel and iron makers had few coking supplies <b>on-hand.</b> These factors kept the union's negotiating position strong despite the two contract rejections.|$|E
25|$|The M1928A1 variant entered mass {{production}} {{before the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, as <b>on-hand</b> stocks ran out. Changes included a horizontal forend, {{in place of the}} distinctive vertical foregrip ("pistol grip"), and a provision for a military sling. Despite new U.S. contracts for Lend-Lease shipments abroad to China, France, and the United Kingdom, as well as the needs of American armed forces, only two factories supplied M1928A1 Thompsons {{during the early years of}} World War II. Though it could use both the 50-round drum and the 20- or 30-round box magazines, active service showed the drums were more prone to jamming, rattled when moving, and were too heavy and bulky on long patrols. 562,511 were made. Wartime production variants had a fixed rear sight without the triangular sight guard wings and a non-ribbed barrel, both like those found on the M1/M1A1.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Superpages and Yellowpages {{cut back}} {{spending}} with Whitepages from $33 million to $7 million, causing a substantial decline in revenues and a tense relationship with investors. Algard spent $50 {{million in cash}} the company had <b>on-hand</b> and $30 million from a bank loan, to buyout the investors in 2013. He also used his personal house, savings account and personal belongings as collateral for the loan. Algard began shifting the company's business model to reduce its reliance on advertising and instead focus on business users and paid subscriptions.|$|E
500|$|To {{ensure safety}} during the Stack period, the {{organizers}} maintained a perimeter around the working area, and allowed only safety-trained students through. Cranes, donated by local construction companies, assisted in getting logs onto the upper tiers, and volunteers from those companies were <b>on-hand</b> {{at all times}} to offer advice. Emergency medical technicians were also required to be on site at all times {{and no more than}} 70students at a time were allowed on the stack. Once the stack was finished, [...] "an outhouse constructed by the freshmen of Texas A's [...] "Fightin' Texas Aggie Band" [...] and painted orange [...] t.u. frat house" [...] was bedecked with derogatory statements about rival University of Texas at Austin and then placed on top of the stack.|$|E
500|$|The {{power plant}} used for {{exterior}} shots in Jacques Renault's arrest scene was in Burbank, California. The location {{was chosen because}} of its large and unusually-shaped buildings; these were lit from behind to enhance their shapes in silhouette. The Hayward house was designed to seem uncharacteristically [...] "normal"; it featured an increased amount of yellows and greys to offset the red tones, and it made use of several household rooms to enhance its appearance of verisimilitude. The location used for the scenes of the Packard sawmill was in Valencia, Santa Clarita; this was chosen because {{it was far from}} the tree line and thus there was no risk of a forest fire occurring after the arson scenes. In addition, any wood used was treated to burn in a controlled manner, and firefighters were <b>on-hand</b> in case of an emergency.|$|E
500|$|It was {{therefore}} no surprise when closure notices were posted in March 1961. The {{last day of}} regular services was Saturday 10 June 1961 when a pair of C class 0-6-0's replaced the usual H class tanks. The event was recorded by a BBC cameraman who filmed the 09:07 departure from Paddock Wood. The Tonbridge crew had chalked on the cabside of the engine [...] "Shed no tears for the single track, for perhaps we may come back. And if we do, you can be sure, we'll see you all again once more." [...] Later in the day the trains were lengthened {{with the addition of}} former LSWR push-pull set No. 656 and a Maunsell corridor coach. The same locomotive worked the last 17:00 train from Hawkhurst, while every seat was taken by locals and railway enthusiasts. The daughter of bandleader Jack Payne was <b>on-hand</b> to toast the final departure.|$|E
2500|$|He {{took his}} {{prototype}} to the Singer head office {{and showed it}} to the office manager James Bolton (1832â€“1916). [...] Bolton was thrilled with the machine and suggested a sewing competition against the best Singer models <b>on-hand</b> at the factory. [...] Whitehill's prototype prevailed, and he sold the rights to it for USD8,000 (USD212,000 adjusted), with USD1,000 held in reserve until he had perfected it for them.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2011, for the ten year {{anniversary of}} the dedication, the Downtown Development Authority spent $30,000 {{cleaning}} the monument and repairing several fixtures and {{the area around the}} monument. The Wayne County Commission and Detroit City Council passed resolutions testimonial resolutions commemorating the anniversary and recognizing the sculptor, Edward Dwight, who at 78 was <b>on-hand</b> to receive them. Additionally, Representative John Conyers, Jr. introduced a resolution to the United States Congress celebrating the 10-year commemoration of the sculpture, however it did not get past committee referrals. A three-day conference, [...] "Celebrating the River at Midnight -The Fluid Frontier: Slavery, War, Freedom, and the Underground Railroad", was also held to commemorate the anniversary.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, and the Army's rapid expansion in response, the shortage of <b>on-hand</b> officers, and projected commissions, caused the Department of the Army to re-open Infantry OCS at Ft. Benning on 18 February 1951. [...] The course was lengthened from 17 to 22 weeks, as a result of lessons learned from WWII; thus permitting more instruction in Infantry tactics. The Infantry Officer Candidate School became the 1st Officer Candidate Battalion, 2nd Student Regiment. [...] The strength of OCS rapidly increased. As one of eight branch programs, Infantry OCS included as many as 29 companies with a class graduating every week. During the Korean War, OCS commissioned approximately 7,000 Infantry officers.|$|E
2500|$|Muto was {{in charge}} of the script for eleven out of the twenty-four episodes. Ubukata and Furuhashi {{provided}} the ideas for the episodes, which the writing staff then adapted into the scripts. [...] "Director Furuhashi as well as Ubukata-san, who is a novelist, both put a lot of weight on the dialogues", Muto said. Suga commented that [...] "ompared to other works, the script for Le Chevalier D'Eon is enormous", noting that one episode had a one hundred-page script. Muto noted that their main focus while writing was the [...] "...'emotion' of each character". Muto was present during the productions' post-recording sessions, primarily because he believed that it would be easier for the staff to have a writer <b>on-hand</b> in case problems arose during recordings.|$|E
2500|$|Politicians have {{distributed}} low-numbered {{license plates}} since 1904 (when {{the first black}} and white porcelain plates were issued by the state) {{as a way to}} reward supporters or associates. Such plates have become a status symbol, similar to the culture surrounding low-numbered plates in Delaware. State officials made Rhode Island one of the few states to allow the owner to transfer license plates to other family members in their will. Additionally, an official license plate lottery was implemented in 1995 through the Governor's Office for [...] "preferred plates". A plate's value depends on its category, with the traditional [...] "Ocean State" [...] legend plate (or [...] "wave plate") being the most valuable. The Division of Motor Vehicles also allows a motorist to choose the two letters {{at the beginning of the}} plate serial, provided that such a combination is available <b>on-hand</b> and is not considered a [...] "preferred plate".|$|E
2500|$|By 1967, {{the ongoing}} naval bombing {{campaign}} from Yankee Station represented {{by far the}} most intense and sustained air attack operation in the U.S. Navy's history, with monthly demand for general purpose bombs (e.g., [...] "iron bombs") greatly exceeding new production. The <b>on-hand</b> supply of bombs had dwindled throughout 1966 and become critically low by 1967, particularly the new 1000-lb Mark 83, which the Navy favored for its power-to-size ratio: a carrier-launched A-4 Skyhawk, the Navy's standard light attack / ground attack aircraft of the period, could carry either a single 2000-lb bomb, or two 1000-lb bombs, with the ability to strike two separate hardened targets in a single sortie being seen as more desirable in most circumstances. Until 1971, the U.S. Air Force's primary ground attack aircraft in Vietnam was the much heavier, land-based, F-105 Thunderchief, which could simultaneously carry two 3,000-lb M118 bombs and four 750-lb M117 bombs (of which the Air Force had large stockpiles available), and thus that service did not need to rely as heavily on the limited supply of 1000-lb bombs as did the Navy.|$|E
2500|$|Otis Williams and {{the other}} Temptations decided to resort to enlisting an <b>on-hand</b> fill-in for Paul Williams. Richard Street, then-lead singer of fellow Motown act The Monitors and {{formerly}} lead singer of The Distants, was hired to travel with The Temptations and sing all of Williams' parts, save for Williams' special numbers such as [...] "Don't Look Back" [...] and [...] "For Once in My Life", from backstage behind a curtain. [...] When Williams was not well enough to go on, Street took his place onstage. In April 1971, Williams was finally persuaded to go see a doctor. The doctor found a spot on Williams' liver and advised him to retire from the group altogether. Williams left the group and Street became his permanent replacement. In support of helping Williams get back on his feet, The Temptations continued to pay Williams his same one-fifth share of the group's earnings, and kept Williams on their payroll as an advisor and choreographer, and Williams continued to help the group with routines and dance moves {{for the next two}} years.|$|E
