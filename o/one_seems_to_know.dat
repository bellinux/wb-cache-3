5|$|Following mass vaccinations, disease {{detection}} and containment were {{central to the}} eradication campaign. As soon as cases were detected, the victims were isolated as were their close contacts, who were vaccinated. Successes came quickly; by 1970 smallpox was no longer endemic in western Africa, nor, by 1971, in Brazil. By 1973, smallpox remained endemic only in the Indian sub-continent, Botswana and Ethiopia. Finally, after 13 years of coordinated disease surveillance and vaccination campaigns throughout the world, the World Health Organisation declared smallpox eradicated in 1979. Although the main weapon used was vaccinia virus, which {{was used as the}} vaccine, no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> exactly where vaccinia virus came from; it is not the strain of cowpox that Edward Jenner used, and it is not a weakened form of smallpox.|$|E

25|$|Morgan {{gets back}} {{together}} with Hunter, and during a family dinner with Hunter, Mary K finally finds {{out the truth}} about what Selene had done to her, and how Selene and Cal died. To make things worse, strange occurrences begin to happen in Morgan's presence. Books begin flying and light bulbs explode, and no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the cause - thus attributing the blame to Morgan. Morgan's school grades begin to slip and she finds herself having difficulty finding a balance between her school work and a life of Wicca. She is grounded because of it, meaning she cannot go to a circle. At the end, Sky leaves.|$|E

'I'm gonna go to Korea,' he told a startled official on the phone. 'No <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> anything about the USO, and it's up to President Truman to get me there.' He was promised that President Truman and General MacArthur, who had taken command of the Korean front, would get to hear of his offer. But for four weeks there was nothing. … Finally, Louis A. Johnson, Secretary of Defense, sent Jolson a telegram. 'Sorry for delay but regret no funds for entertainment – STOP; USO disbanded – STOP.' The message was as much an assault on the Jolson sense of patriotism as the actual crossing of the 38th Parallel had been. 'What are they talkin' about', he thundered. 'Funds? Who needs funds? I got funds! I'll pay myself!'" ...|$|E

60|$|Then the Bee {{slipped back}} her kaross, and stood bending {{over the fire}} before them, into which she threw herbs taken from a pouch that was bound about her middle. She was still a finely-shaped woman, and she wore none of the abominations which Hadden had been {{accustomed}} to see upon the persons of witch-doctoresses. About her neck, however, was a curious ornament, a small live snake, red and grey in hue, which her visitors recognised {{as one of the}} most deadly to be found in that part of the country.

"Two {{separate}} and independent witnesses, cleverly unearthed by the police, had seen this same shabbily dressed individual stroll into the first-class waiting-room at about 6.15 on Wednesday, December the 10th, and go straight up to a gentleman {{in a heavy}} fur coat and cap, who had also just come into the room.

6000|$|We now had an {{opportunity}} of learning {{some of the great}} events that had recently occurred in France, and which still troubled Europe.

[...] Commerce was at a standstill; our master passed half his time under arms, as a national guard, {{in order to keep the}} revolutionists from revolutionizing the revolution. The great families had laid aside their liveries; some of them their coaches; most of them their arms.

6000|$|And {{then from}} time to time little rumours reached her ears which made her aware that, in the teeth of all Mr Melmotte's social successes, a general opinion that he was a {{gigantic}} swindler was rather gaining ground than otherwise. 'Your host is a wonderful fellow, by George!' said Lord Nidderdale. 'No <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> which way he'll turn up at last.' 'There's nothing like being a robber, if you can only rob enough,' said Lord Grasslough,--not exactly naming Melmotte, but very clearly alluding to him. There was a vacancy for a member of parliament at Westminster, and Melmotte was about to come forward as a candidate. 'If he can manage that I think he'll pull through,' she heard one man say. 'If money'll do it, it will be done,' said another. She could understand it all. Mr Melmotte was admitted into society, because of some enormous power which was supposed to lie in his hands; but even by those who thus admitted him he was regarded as a thief and a scoundrel. This was the man whose house had been selected by her father in order that she might make her search for a husband from beneath his wing! ...|$|E
60|$|The mosses and lichens, green, sulphur, and amber, stud {{the copper}} floor of needles, where the {{feathery}} ground-pine runs aimlessly {{to and fro}} along the ground, spelling out broken words of half-forgotten charms. There are checker-berries {{on the outskirts of}} the wood, where the partridge (he is a ruffed grouse really) dines, and by the deserted logging-roads toadstools of all colours sprout on the decayed stumps. Wherever a green or blue rock lifts from the hillside, the needles have been packed and matted round its base, till, when the sunshine catches them, stone and setting together look no meaner than turquoise in dead gold. The woods are full of colour, belts and blotches of it, the colours of the savage--red, yellow, and blue. Yet in their lodges there is very little life, for the wood-people do not readily go into the shadows. The squirrels have their business among the beeches and hickories by the road-side, where they can watch the traffic and talk. We have no gray ones hereabouts (they are good to eat and suffer for it), but five reds live in a hickory hard by, and no weather puts them to sleep. The wood-chuck, a marmot and a strategist, makes his burrow in the middle of a field, where he must see you ere you see him. Now and again a dog manages to cut him off his base, and the battle is worth crossing fields to watch. But the woodchuck turned in long ago, and will not be out till April. The coon lives--well, no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> particularly where Brer Coon lives, but when the Hunter's Moon is large and full he descends into the corn-lands, and men chase him with dogs for his fur, which makes the finest kind of overcoat, and his flesh, which tastes like chicken. He cries at night sorrowfully as though a child were lost.|$|E

50|$|Many full {{forwards}} {{are quick}} on the lead, but the truly great <b>ones</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> instinctively how <b>to</b> get the maximum advantage from their leads by timing them to perfection. In this particular skill, McKenna has had few peers, {{and once he}} had gained possession of the ball, usually from a bullet stab pass from Barry Price or Wayne Richardson, he almost invariably finished things off with consummate precision, typically using a kick on which the jury, at the time, was still out - the drop punt.|$|R

As their landlord was always up and away at his business (whatever that might be, no <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know)</b> {{at a very early}} hour, the habits {{of the people of the}} house in which they lodged corresponded with their own.
