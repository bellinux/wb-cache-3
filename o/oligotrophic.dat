5|$|This species {{lives on}} hard benthic substrates, {{typically}} rocks. It lives on pebbles, sometimes on boulders, and rarely on dead wood. It tolerates mild organic pollution, low oxygen content (down to below 2mg/liter) {{but it does}} not tolerate long periods of droughts, or ice. It lives in mesotrophic waters, and sometimes in <b>oligotrophic</b> waters.|$|E
5|$|The fauna {{includes}} {{several species of}} zooplankton and benthic animals. Since the lake is <b>oligotrophic</b> (nutrient-poor), the native fish fauna is relatively scarce, and the only endemics are Rasbora tobana (strictly speaking near-endemic, since also found in some tributary rivers that run into the lake) and Neolissochilus thienemanni, locally known as the Batak fish. The latter species is threatened by deforestation (causing siltation), pollution, changes in water level and the numerous fish species that have been introduced to the lake. Other native fishes include species such as Aplocheilus panchax, Nemacheilus pfeifferae, Homaloptera gymnogaster, Channa gachua, Channa striata, Clarias batrachus, Barbonymus gonionotus, Barbonymus schwanenfeldii, Danio albolineatus, Osteochilus vittatus, Puntius binotatus, Rasbora jacobsoni, Tor tambra, Betta imbellis, Betta taeniata and Monopterus albus. Among the many introduced species are Anabas testudineus, Oreochromis mossambicus, Oreochromis niloticus, Ctenopharyngodon idella, Cyprinus carpio, Osphronemus goramy, Trichogaster pectoralis, Trichopodus trichopterus, Poecilia reticulata and Xiphophorus hellerii.|$|E
5|$|Even though Croatia has {{sufficient}} water resources at its disposal, {{these are not}} uniformly distributed and public water supply network losses remain high—estimated at 44%. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of stations monitoring surface water pollution increased by 20%; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period. At the same time organic waste pollution levels decreased slightly, which is attributed to the completion of new sewage treatment plants; their number increased 20%, reaching a total of 101. Nearly all of Croatia's groundwater aquifers are top quality, unlike the available surface water; the latter's quality varies in terms of biochemical oxygen demand and bacteriological water analysis results. As of 2008, 80% of the Croatian population are served by the public water supply system, but only 44% of the population {{have access to the}} public sewerage network, with septic systems in use. Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good, <b>oligotrophic</b> conditions along most of the coast, while areas of increased eutrophication were identified in the Bay of Bakar, the Bay of Kaštela, the Port of Šibenik and near Ploče; other areas of localized pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities. In the period between 2004 and 2008, the CEA identified 283 cases of marine pollution (including 128 from vessels), which was a drop of 15% relative to the period encompassed by the previous report, 1997 to August 2005.|$|E
25|$|Along {{the border}} with Venezuela lies Monte Roraima, home to many {{carnivorous}} plants. The plants evolved to digest insects due to the <b>oligotrophic</b> (low level of nutrients) soil of the tepui.|$|E
25|$|Long-stalked {{pondweed}} {{is one of}} {{the so-called}} Magnopotamion group of pondweeds. These are a characteristic floristic component of the protected Habitats Directive habitat Type 'Natural eutrophic lakes with Magnopotamion. However, in Britain at least, P. praelongus is now predominantly found in <b>oligotrophic</b> to mesotrophic waters.|$|E
25|$|In Britain and Ireland, {{this is one}} of the commonest pondweeds, {{occurring}} in almost any wet or semi-wet <b>oligotrophic</b> and / or acidic habitat so long as flow is not too rapid. It may be found in lakes, slow-flowing rivers, ponds, ditches, seeps and among bog mosses (Sphagnum). As its name suggests, it is common in areas of blanket bog but may also occur in secondary habitats such as unshaded drainage ditches in bogs and forest plantations. In British rivers it typically grows with other soft-water species such as Ranunculus flammula, Carex nigra, C. rostrata, Scapania undulata and Equisetum fluviatile. In lakes it tends to occur in base-poor, <b>oligotrophic</b> waters with species such as Littorella uniflora, Sphagnum spp., Lobelia dortmanna and Isoetes lacustris especially with a peaty substrate.|$|E
25|$|Muckross Lake and the Upper Lake {{are high}} quality <b>oligotrophic</b> systems, with {{water that is}} {{slightly}} acidic and low in nutrients. This is caused by run-off from the upland sandstones and blanket bogs in their catchment areas. They have diverse aquatic vegetation, including quillwort (Isoetes lacustris), shoreweed (Littorella uniflora), and water lobelia (Lobelia dortmanna).|$|E
25|$|The {{nutrients}} {{in the ocean}} are not uniformly distributed. Areas of upwelling provide supplies of nitrogen from below the euphotic zone. Coastal zones provide nitrogen from runoff and upwelling occurs readily along the coast. However, {{the rate at which}} nitrogen can be taken up by phytoplankton is decreased in <b>oligotrophic</b> waters year-round and temperate water in the summer resulting in lower primary production. The distribution of the different forms of nitrogen varies throughout the oceans as well.|$|E
25|$|Benthopelagic sharks, {{like the}} deep sea squaloid sharks, achieve neutral {{buoyancy}} {{with the use of}} large oil-filled livers. Sharks adapt well to fairly high pressures. They can often be found on slopes down to about 2000 metres, scavenging on food falls such as dead whales. However, the energy demands of sharks are high, since they need to swim constantly and maintain a large amount of oil for buoyancy. These energy needs cannot be met in the extreme <b>oligotrophic</b> conditions that occur at great depths.|$|E
25|$|The first {{comprehensive}} phytoplankton {{survey was}} released in 2006. With an annual average chlorophyll a in the mixed layer of 2.2mg m−3 and low nutrient levels in the euphotic zone, the lake is clearly <b>oligotrophic.</b> Diatoms are the dominant group in the lake, particularly {{during the dry season}} episodes of deep mixing. During the rainy season, the stratified water column, with high light and lower nutrient availability, favour dominance of cyanobacteria with high numbers of phototrophic picoplankton. The actual primary production is 0.71g C m−2 d−1 (≈ 260g C m−2 a−1).|$|E
25|$|Lake Superior {{has fewer}} {{dissolved}} nutrients relative to its water volume {{than the other}} Great Lakes and so is less productive in terms of fish populations and is an <b>oligotrophic</b> lake. This {{is a result of}} the underdeveloped soils found in its relatively small watershed. However, nitrate concentrations in the lake have been continuously rising for more than a century. They are still much lower than levels considered dangerous to human health; but this steady, long-term rise is an unusual record of environmental nitrogen buildup. It may relate to anthropogenic alternations to the regional nitrogen cycle, but researchers are still unsure of the causes of this change to the lake's ecology.|$|E
25|$|Lakes can be also {{categorized}} on {{the basis}} of their richness in nutrients, which typically affect plant growth. Nutrient-poor lakes are said to be <b>oligotrophic</b> and are generally clear, having a low concentration of plant life. Mesotrophic lakes have good clarity and an average level of nutrients. Eutrophic lakes are enriched with nutrients, resulting in good plant growth and possible algal blooms. Hypertrophic lakes are bodies of water that have been excessively enriched with nutrients. These lakes typically have poor clarity and are subject to devastating algal blooms. Lakes typically reach this condition due to human activities, such as heavy use of fertilizers in the lake catchment area. Such lakes are of little use to humans and have a poor ecosystem due to decreased dissolved oxygen.|$|E
500|$|Lake Vostok is an <b>oligotrophic</b> extreme environment, {{one that}} is {{expected}} to be supersaturated with nitrogen and oxygen, measuring [...] of nitrogen and oxygen per [...] of water, that is 50 times higher than those typically found in ordinary freshwater lakes on Earth's surface. The sheer weight and pressure around [...] of the continental ice cap on top of Lake Vostok is estimated to contribute to the high gas concentration.|$|E
500|$|Stony corals {{occur in}} all the world's oceans. There are two main {{ecological}} groups. Hermatypic corals are mostly colonial corals which tend to live in clear, <b>oligotrophic,</b> shallow tropical waters; they are the world's primary reef-builders. Ahermatypic corals are either colonial or solitary and are found in all regions {{of the ocean and}} do not build reefs. Some live in tropical waters but some inhabit temperate seas, polar waters, or live at great depths, from the photic zone down to about [...]|$|E
500|$|Salta Moss is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, {{both for}} its natural and {{historical}} significance, and is itself {{is located in}} a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty which covers much of the Solway Plain. The Moss is an area of peatland, containing [...] "mainly <b>oligotrophic</b> semi- fibrous grass-sedge peat" [...] according to Soil Survey Record. It combines characteristics of both a raised bog and a valley mire, and lies atop deposits of glacial sand from the last ice age. It was designated an SSSI in 1954.|$|E
500|$|The {{other common}} {{adaptation}} is {{the possession of}} cluster roots, which allow it to extract enough nutrients {{to survive in the}} <b>oligotrophic</b> soils in which it grows. With the onset of autumn rains, the lateral roots form dense surface mats of cluster roots in the top [...] of soil, just below the leaf litter, where most minerals are concentrated. These roots exude chemicals that enhance mineral solubility, greatly increasing the availability and uptake of nutrients in impoverished soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. For as long as surface water is available, they take in water and a range of minerals. In B.prionotes they are principally responsible for the uptake of malate, phosphate, chloride, sodium and potassium. When soils are high in nitrates, they may also perform some nitrate reductase activities, primarily the conversion of ammonium into amino acids such as asparagine and glutamine.|$|E
500|$|The Bull Run River's three reservoirs—Bull Run Lake, Bull Run Reservoir1, and Bull Run Reservoir2—are <b>oligotrophic</b> and do {{not sustain}} many life forms. Bull Run Lake is in a steep-sided cirque blocked at its lower end {{by a series of}} lava flows topped by debris from a glacial moraine. Small streams flow into the lake from ridges above it, and water exits the lake mainly by seeping through porous rock to enter the Bull Run River about [...] downstream. Evidence {{suggests}} that over the past several thousand years, although forest fires in the area and volcanic activity on Mount Hood or Mount St. Helens [...] have caused temporary changes in the lake's limnological condition, it [...] "has always returned to conditions similar to those seen at present." [...] Turbidity is sometimes a problem in Reservoirs1 and 2 when unstable soils sandwiched between layers of lava erode into tributaries, especially the North and South forks.|$|E

[...] Based on available data, the lake's trophic state is classified as <b>oligotrophic.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Collodarians {{are found}} {{throughout}} the oceans but high populations of Collodarians aggregate in calm and <b>oligotrophic</b> surface waters. [...] Biard et al. (2015) quoted high densities of Collodarian colonies {{has been reported in}} the Gulf of Aden and in the North Pacific Ocean. The diverse distribution and abundance of Collodaria suggest its significance in ecology and the biogeochemical pathways of the oceans. Collodarians are mixotrophs involved in different trophic levels within the ocean food webs since they can actively prey on a variety of organisms including copepods, ciliates, phytoplankton, and bacteria. Collodarians can participate in carbon fixation as most species have acquired intracellular microalgae symbionts (Hollande and Enjumet 1953). Dinoflagellate Brandotodium nutricula is a common endosymbiont of Collodarians.|$|E
2500|$|Although kelp {{forests are}} unknown in {{tropical}} surface waters, a few species of Laminaria {{have been known}} to occur exclusively in tropical deep waters. This general absence of kelp from the tropics is believed to be mostly due to insufficient nutrient levels associated with warm, <b>oligotrophic</b> waters. One recent study spatially overlaid the requisite physical parameters for kelp with mean oceanographic conditions has produced a model predicting the existence of subsurface kelps throughout the tropics worldwide to depths of 200 m. For a hotspot in the Galapagos Islands, the local model was improved with fine-scale data and tested; the research team found thriving kelp forests in all eight of their sampled sites, all of which had been predicted by the model, thus validated their approach. This suggests that their global model might actually be fairly accurate, and if so, kelp forests would be prolific in tropical subsurface waters worldwide. The importance of this contribution has been rapidly acknowledged within the scientific community and has prompted an entirely new trajectory of kelp forest research, particularly emphasizing the potential for a spatial refuge from climate change also the [...] explanations to evolutionary patterns of kelps worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|The lake lies on a {{sandy plain}} in the Horowhenua, [...] {{southwest}} of central Levin and [...] from Hokio Beach on the Tasman Sea. It covers , but is shallow, less than [...] deep. The lake {{was once a}} sandy coastal lagoon {{at the mouth of}} the Ohau River, and the forested terraces on its landward side were once sea cliffs. Over time, sand dunes built up, the river changed its course, and the sea retreated, until about 9000 years ago the lagoon was dammed and became a dune lake. The bottom of the lake now consists of 15 m of accumulated silt and mud over the original sand, and preserves layers of volcanic ash from eruptions 8,000 and 5,900 years ago. Fossil pollen suggests it was surrounded by continuous forest even after human settlement of the plains. Lake Papaitonga is fed by groundwater and various small streams and springs, and drained by the Waiwiri Stream. Because it is bordered by forest, the lake is <b>oligotrophic,</b> with low levels of phosphorus and nitrogen. The lake was relatively deep and stable until the 1940s, but with the increase in horticulture nearby and the digging of irrigation bores it is becoming increasingly shallow.|$|E
50|$|Ecologists use {{the term}} <b>oligotrophic</b> to {{distinguish}} unproductive lakes, characterised by nutrient deficiency, from productive, eutrophic lakes, with an ample or excessive nutrient supply. <b>Oligotrophic</b> lakes are most common in cold regions underlain by resistant igneous rocks (especially granitic bedrock).|$|E
