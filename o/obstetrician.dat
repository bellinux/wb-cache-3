40|$|OBJECTIVE. To study {{treatment}} of hypertension in pregnancy in Sweden and compare our results {{with a similar}} study published in 1981. METHODS. A multiple choice questionnaire was sent to 92 <b>obstetricians</b> throughout Sweden and 88 % responded. RESULTS. Most Swedish <b>obstetricians</b> would treat {{a woman in the}} second trimester with blood pressure 140 / 95 mmHg without antihypertensive medication (83 %) in the out-patient clinic (81 %). The corresponding figures according to a similar study published in 1981 were 33 % and 71 % of <b>obstetricians,</b> respectively. Almost all <b>obstetricians</b> (95 %) would give antihypertensive treatment if the blood pressure was 170 / 110 mmHg or more. Betablockers and hydralazine were the most commonly used drugs. Sixteen per cent of <b>obstetricians</b> would use calcium antagonists, drugs not available in the previous study. Treatment with diuretics, methyldopa or diazepam in hypertension was rarely used. Eight per cent of <b>obstetricians</b> would give low-dose aspirin to patients with mild hypertension and 20 % to patients with severe hypertension. Fourteen per cent of <b>obstetricians</b> would stop all kind of antihypertensive medication and frequently observe patients with essential hypertension. CONCLUSION. Antihypertensive therapy and management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy show a great disparity among Swedish <b>obstetricians.</b> National strategies might improve the morbidity and mortality associated with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy...|$|R

5|$|Beginning January 17, 1848, {{the eight}} {{founders of the}} Misericorde Sisters, {{including}} Cadron-Jetté, commenced practical training in midwifery under Dr Eugène-Hercule Trudele, a young <b>obstetrician.</b> The objective of the training was to better prepare the sisters to meet the obligations of their fourth vow. The training lasted for 18 months and concluded with an examination before {{two members of the}} College of Physicians and Surgeons of Lower Canada, with the result that on July 12, 1849, the women received formal certificates of midwifery.

5|$|In 1992 Michael filed a {{malpractice}} {{suit against}} Terri's <b>obstetrician</b> {{on the basis}} that he failed to diagnose bulimia as the cause of her infertility. Terri had gone to the doctor because she had stopped menstruating but the doctor had failed to take her medical history into account which might have revealed an eating disorder. During the case, one of Terri's friends testified that she knew Schiavo was bulimic. In November 1992, Michael won the case and was awarded $6.8 million by the jury, later reduced to $2 million as Terri was found partly at fault for her condition. After attorneys' fees and other expenses, Michael received $300,000 and $750,000 was put in a trust fund for Terri's medical care.

40|$|Abstract Background The World Health Organization International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes (WHO Code) aims {{to protect}} and promote breastfeeding. Japan {{ratified}} the WHO Code in 1994, but most hospitals in Japan continue to receive free supplies of infant formula and distribute discharge packs to new mothers provided by infant formula companies. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the knowledge and attitudes of pediatricians and <b>obstetricians</b> in Japan to the WHO Code. Methods A self-completion questionnaire was sent to 132 pediatricians in the 131 NICUs which belonged to the Neonatal Network of Japan, and to 96 chief <b>obstetricians</b> in the general hospitals in the Kanto area of Japan, in 2004. Results Responses were received from 68 % of pediatricians and 64 % of <b>obstetricians.</b> Sixty-six percent of pediatricians agreed that "Breastmilk is the best", compared to only 13 % of <b>obstetricians.</b> Likewise, pediatricians were more likely to be familiar with the WHO Code (51 %) than <b>obstetricians</b> (18 %). Conclusion In Japan, pediatricians and <b>obstetricians,</b> in general, have low levels of support for breastfeeding and low levels of familiarity with the WHO Code. To increase the breastfeeding rates in Japan, both pediatricians and <b>obstetricians</b> need increased knowledge about current infant feeding practices and increased awareness of international policies to promote breastfeeding. </p...|$|R

5|$|Stokvis {{was born}} to Rachel Wittering and Joseph Barend Stokvis, Jr., a Jewish {{physician}} and <b>obstetrician</b> in Amsterdam. He studied medicine in Amsterdam and at the University of Utrecht under Franciscus Donders and Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk, obtaining a doctorate on a dissertation on hepatic glucose production in diabetes in 1856. His thesis appeared shortly {{after the publication of}} related work by the French physiologist Claude Bernard. Stokvis may also have been influenced by the chemist Gerardus Mulder in Amsterdam. Subsequently, he travelled to Paris and Vienna (and possibly Prague), before establishing himself in medical practice in Amsterdam. He continued his medical research under the physiologists Adriaan Heynsius, Wilhelm Kühne and Thomas Place. In 1867, the Brussels Academy awarded a gold medal to Stokvis for an essay on the development of albuminuria, a kidney disorder in which the protein albumin can be detected in the urine.|$|E
5|$|While {{preparing}} for Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) baby shower, her mother, Margaret (Sheila Larken), invites {{a woman named}} Lizzy Gill to help Scully around her apartment. Unbeknownst to Scully, Gill tampers with her pregnancy medications. Meanwhile, Billy Miles (Zachary Aynsley), satisfied with the research conducted at Zeus Genetics in Germantown, kills the head scientist, Dr. Lev, and burns the laboratory. All of the evidence at Zeus Genetics is destroyed, including the viable hybrid fetus. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) informs John Doggett (Robert Patrick) of the fire at Zeus Genetics, and asks to go along to survey the crime scene. Mulder reveals that Dr. Lev is connected to Scully's former <b>obstetrician,</b> Dr. Parenti. While searching Dr. Parenti's office, the agents find another storage room containing hybrid fetuses.

We investigated {{the effects of}} the centralization of <b>obstetricians</b> and obstetric care facilities on the perinatal mortality rate in Japan. Methods. We used the Gini coefficient as an index to represent the centralization of <b>obstetricians</b> and obstetric care facilities. The Gini coefficients were calculated for the number of <b>obstetricians</b> and obstetric care facilities of 47 prefectures using secondarymedical care zones as units. Tomeasure {{the effects of the}} centralization of <b>obstetricians</b> and obstetric care facilities on the outcomes (perinatal mortality rates), we performedmultiple regression analysis using the perinatal mortality rate as the dependent variable. Results. Obstetric care facilities were more evenly distributed than <b>obstetricians.</b> The perinatal mortality rate was found to be significantly negatively correlated with the number of <b>obstetricians</b> per capita and the Gini coefficient of obstetric care facilities.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{management}} options, risks and thematic content that <b>obstetricians</b> and neonatologists discuss in periviable counseling. STUDY DESIGN: Sixteen <b>obstetricians</b> and 15 neonatologists counseled simulated patients portraying {{a pregnant woman}} with ruptured membranes at 23 weeks of gestation. Transcripts from video-recorded encounters were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed for informational content and decision-making themes. RESULT: <b>Obstetricians</b> more frequently discussed antibiotics (P= 0. 005), maternal risks (< 0. 001) and cesarean risks (< 0. 005). Neonatologists more frequently discussed neonatal complications (P= 0. 044), resuscitation (P= 0. 015) and palliative options (P= 0. 023). <b>Obstetricians</b> and neonatologists often deferred questions about steroid administration to the other specialty. Both specialties organized decision making around medical information, survival, quality of life, time and support.
