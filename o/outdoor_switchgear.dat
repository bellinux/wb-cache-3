In the introduction of my theses there are explained basic ideas and theories of switchgears and described main devices and equipments which create classic (from equipment setting point of view) <b>outdoor</b> <b>switchgears</b> of very high voltage. Subsequently it describes possible ways of linking-up of these devices in the complex of switchgears themselves according to possible dispositions arranged and busbars systems. The same focus is dedicated to new, non-classic (non-standard solution in terms of devices solution), compact solving of outdoor very high voltage modules either by air isolated or by means of enclosed technology with gas SF 6 which represent innovative solving first of all from reduction of built up area point of view which is very important from economic point of view especially during constructions of new switchgears.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of studies of the effects of lightning on low voltage systems of high voltage electrical substations with <b>outdoor</b> <b>switchgears</b> of 110 kV. The topicality of research is associated with a wide spreading of such substations as well as with a high reliability requirements of their work and, also, with their widespread distribution and high probability of lightning strikes to the substation or around it. The highest probable and the most dangerous effects of lightning on low voltage systems of a substation are determined on the basis of critical review and special literature analysis and, also, of systematization of practical information that had been collected during the survey of operating substations. Adequate physical models were developed for the list of hazardous effects based on physical processes of lightning. A model of each effect was studied {{on the basis of the}} sensitivity theory. The accuracy and adequacy of the models were verified by means of comparison of calculation results for the models under investigation with the results of calculations fulfilled in accordance with specialized programs, as well as from practical or theoretical data obtained by other authors. The factors that had been included in the models were studied and were defined in accordance with their nature (natural or artificial), the range of possible values in a substation was determined; the coefficients of elasticity were calculated. The obtained results enable to ascertain the contribution of the factor in the effect of lightning and the ability to control the factor. The relationship between the factors and the effects of lightning are shown as graphs. For practical application the information, obtained as the result of the research, was organized in the form of checklists that can be applied when collecting baseline information to develop the lightning protection of the substation, to examine the existing lightning protection, to investigate emergency situations associated with lightning strikes. The results of the study were used in practice during the pre-design survey of substations, development of the design assignment, design of lightning protection of a substation, and during fulfillment of acceptance tests and periodic inspections of lightning protection. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{switchyard}} of substations fed from voltages below 30 kV is indoors, <b>outdoor</b> <b>switchgear</b> is used at 110 kV. The {{distance between}} substations is between 15 and 28 kilometres. For reliability of supply, substations are usually fed {{by at least}} two powerlines. Each substation normally feeds two segments of the overhead wire, which are separated by a switch. As is common with DC systems, the negative pole is grounded.Halfway between two substations, there is a switch, {{which can be used}} to connect the overhead wires together. At some lines a three-phase AC line operated with 6 kV, 15 kV or 20 kV runs parallel to the railway line, either on the poles of the overhead wire or on separate poles. It is used for power supply of signals, level crossing equipment and other devices requiring electric power used for the rail. This line can be also used for emergency power supply of substations.|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of the development of new methods aimed at more accurate interval estimate of the experimental values of voltages on grounding devices of substations and circuits in the control cables, that occur when lightning strikes to lightning rods; the abovementioned estimate made it possible to increase the accuracy {{of the results of the}} study of lightning noise by 28 %. A more accurate value of interval estimation were achieved by developing a measurement model that takes into account, along with the measured values, different measurement errors and includes the special processing of the measurement results. As a result, the interval of finding the true value of the sought voltage is determined with an accuracy of 95 %. The methods can be applied to the IK- 1 and IKP- 1 measurement complexes, consisting in the aperiodic pulse generator, the generator of high-frequency pulses and selective voltmeters, respectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of the developed methods series of experimental voltage assessments of grounding devices of ten active high-voltage substation have been fulfilled in accordance with the developed methods and traditional techniques. The evaluation results confirmed the possibility of finding the true values of voltage over a wide range, that ought to be considered in the process of technical diagnostics of lightning protection of substations when the analysis of the measurement results and the development of measures to reduce the effects of lightning are being fulfilled. Also, a comparative analysis of the results of measurements made in accordance with the developed methods and traditional techniques has demonstrated that the true value of the sought voltage may exceed the measured value at an average of 28 %, that ought to be considered in the further analysis of the parameters of lightning protection at the facility and in the development of corrective actions. The developed methods have been tested in surveys of the electromagnettic environment of 27 active high voltage electric substations with a 110 kV <b>outdoor</b> <b>switchgear.</b> The application of the techniques amended the accuracy of the information collected, the correctness of the evaluation of the electromagnetic environment of high-voltage substations with a 110 kV <b>outdoor</b> <b>switchgear,</b> the effectiveness of the developed adequate measures to protect against lightning effects...|$|E

40|$|The {{intensity}} of the electrodynamic action of currents of a short circuit on the flexible conductors of overhead lines depends on the magnitude of currents of short-circuit. The commis sioning of new capacities is inevitably accompanied {{by an increase in}} short circuit currents in the nodes of the grid, so the need to limit peaks of tension arising in a short-circuit can acquire a special relevance at a certain stage of development of the power system. At short circuit currents over 40 kA the mechanical force and displacement of the wires can have a decisive influence on the structural performance of flexible bus as of single wires as well as of split phases. In this regard {{there is a need for}} the development and use of new structural elements enhancing electrodynamic stability of flexible busbars of <b>outdoor</b> <b>switchgear.</b> One such element is a tension damper. The damper is installed between the portal and the insulator string and limits the transmission of undesirable forces on the portals in a short circuit. The numerical method of calculation of dynamics of flexible wires of switchgear and overhead lines in a short-circuit taking into account influence of a tension damper has been developed. This method was used for modification of the computer program of calculation of electrodynamic stability. With the aid of the computer program it was demonstrated that the installation of the tension damper makes it possible to cut off peaks of the tension of wire in a short circuit at the initial stage of movement of the conductors. However, in spans of a great length after the actuation of the damper the occurrence of new bursts of tension is possible due to the sudden stop of the wire.  </p...|$|E
