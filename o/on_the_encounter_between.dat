40|$|Volunteer tourism has rapidly {{emerged as}} a {{pervasive}} form of contemporary global tourism. This paper examines the importance of incorporating non-representational theories into analyses of volunteer tourism. Discussions of volunteer tourism are often framed within fixed notions of culture, identity and power relations. In this paper I argue that attention to embodiment, affect and emotion can provide more nuanced insights into the ambiguities of volunteer experiences and encounters. Drawing on fieldwork from a small coastal town in Peru, <b>the</b> study focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>encounters</b> <b>between</b> volunteers and locals {{and the role of}} emotions in the framing of their experiences. While emotions and expectations are often framed by development aid discourses that characterise volunteers and locals into neo-colonial binaries, there are also numerous possibilities for how volunteers and locals are ‘affected’. By attending to the ‘more than rational’ dimensions of the volunteer tourism experience I draw out the relationship between embodiment, affect and what philosopher of hope Bloch (1986) calls the ‘ontology of the-not-yet’. It is within <b>the</b> embodied <b>encounters</b> in spaces of ‘the-not-yet-become’ where hopeful possibilities in volunteer tourism are found’ This opens up new ways of understanding volunteer tourism. This may, in turn, facilitate more responsible and equitable practice in volunteer tourism projects...|$|R

At the end of the research, I arrived at the following conclusions: That tension between Christianity and the African Traditional Religions are more contentious in the urban areas. At the rural areas {{there seems to be a}} comfortable marriage of the two. They don’t see anything wrong with the mixture of the two religions. They happily perform rituals together. I also concluded that an adoption of contextual theology and its anthropological model it appears may be the only way of getting urban Christians to tolerate traditional religious practices, and those who seek to mix the two traditions in funeral practices, but in doing this the fundamentals of the Christian faith should not be shredded away. I also observed that in the urban areas, people are more guarded with their emotions and resources as compared to their rural folks who give liberally. I also concluded that the effects of funeral rituals it appears cannot be generated without the aid of women serving as agents, and alcohol to help aid loosing of consciousness so as to facilitate mourning and food to strengthen family and societal bonds.

40|$|Receiving great {{interest}} {{from the research}} community, Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are a type of Next Generation Networks (NGNs) proposed to bridge communication in challenged environments. In this paper, the message replication probability is proportionally sprayed for efficient routing mainly under sparse scenario. This methodology {{is different from the}} spray based algorithms using message copy tickets to control replication. Our heuristic algorithm aims to overcome the scalability of the spray based algorithms, since to determine the initial value of the copy tickets requires the assumption that either the number of nodes is known in advance, or the underlying mobility model follows the Random WayPoint (RWP) characteristic. Specifically, in combining with the assistance of geographic information to estimate the movement range of destination, the routing decision is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>encounter</b> angle <b>between</b> pairwise nodes, and is dynamically switched between the designed two routing phases, named as geographic replication and replication probability spray. Furthermore, messages are under prioritized transmission with the consideration of redundancy pruning.
