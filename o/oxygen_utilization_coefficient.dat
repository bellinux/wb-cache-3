There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in SvO 2 between the continuous in vivo values and in vitro values (0. 694 +/- 0. 095 vs. 0. 698 +/- 0. 108). There was no statistically significant correlation between continuously measured SvO 2 and PaO 2 (r = 0. 09, p greater than 0. 5), SaO 2 (r = 0. 08, p greater than 0. 5), or oxygen consumption (r = 0. 46, p greater than 0. 5). There was a slight but statistically significant correlation between continuously measured SvO 2 and cardiac output (r = 0. 40, p less than 0. 025) and oxygen delivery (r = 0. 49, p less than 0. 005). There was a highly significant correlation between continuously measured SvO 2 and <b>oxygen</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>coefficient</b> (r = - 0. 96, p less than 0. 001).

The authors undertook {{this study to}} examine the accuracy, utility, and limitations of the technique in surgical critical care. Twelve critically ill patients underwent placement of a modified pulmonary artery catheter and a pulse oximeter, both connected to an on-line computer. Paired blood gas and oximeter measurements were recorded every 4 to 6 hours, {{with a minimum of}} six sets per patient. Blood-gas-derived shunt fraction correlated well with oximeter-derived ventilation-perfusion index (r = 0. 78, p less than 0. 01). Further, the continuous oxygen extraction ratio (O 2 EI) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SpvO 2) correlated with the <b>oxygen</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>coefficient</b> (O 2 EI:r = 0. 6, p less than 0. 01; SpvO 2, r = 0. 76, p less than 0. 01). Computer modeling of ventilation-perfusion index found limitations in accuracy that occur at high arterial oxygen saturations and when pulse oximetry errors are present. The authors conclude that (1) Continuous dual oximetry offers a significant advantage over routine blood gas analysis for monitoring cardiopulmonary parameters in critically ill patients because of its real-time display; (2) Oximeter-derived determinations parallel traditional parameters; and (3) The most significant technical limitations occur primarily at high arterial saturations and with pulse oximetry errors...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} bronchial obstruction syndrome on perioperative characteristics in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods. Body plethysmography and spiroergometry at rest were used to study respiratory function and consumption of O 2. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} pulmonary ventilation, the <b>oxygen</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>coefficient</b> of (O 2 CU) was calculated in 178 patients prior to scheduled surgery. The relationship of external ventilation parameters and perioperative clinical characteristics was analyzed. Results. A bronchial obstruction syndrome was detected in 30 (16. 9 %) patients, with 21 (11. 2 %) of them having no chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis. 4 patients (2. 3 %) with obstructive pulmonary disease had no bronchial obstruction. Thus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was misdiagnosed in 13. 5 % cases. In patients undergoing isolated CABG, negative relationship was revealed between the Tiffno index and hospital stay (regression coefficient – 6. 9, 95 %, confidence interval – 14. 4 … 0. 6; p = 0. 07). In patients operated with the myocardium stabilized, bimammary grafting tended to increase hospital stay by an average of 4. 3 days (95 % CI 1. 5 – 7. 1; p= 0. 003). The majority of patients had a low O 2 CU. O 2 CU lower than 16. 2 ml/l is associated with an increased risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) in the postoperative period (OR 2. 96; 95 % CI 1. 01 – 9. 83; p = 0. 04). No significant associations were observed between the degree of bronchial obstruction and the number of perioperative complications. Conclusion. The degree of bronchial obstruction could be positively associated with the length of hospital stay. A critically low level of O 2 CU is explained by an increased risk of postoperative AF. Further research might result in the identification of predictors for respiratory complications and long-term mortality in patients after CABG. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} central hemodynamics, the {{determinants}} of coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen demand, and the parameters of blood oxygen-transport function during alveolar mobilization in early periods after extracorporeal circulation in patients operated on for coronary heart disease. Subjects and methods. Twenty-nine patients were examined after myocardial revascularization. The alveolae were mobilized 63 ± 2 min after extracorporeal circulation. The peak airway pressure was 31 ± 0. 3 H 2 O. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring was provided with Swan-Ganz catheters. Results. After building up the peak airway pressure, there was a 7. 5 — 15 mm Hg blood pressure reduction (p< 0. 05) and 3. 7 mm Hg right atrial and pulmonary artery wedge pressure elevations (p< 0. 05). Total pulmonary vascular resistance increased by 44 % (p< 0. 05). Cardiac index reduced by 15 % (p< 0. 05) due to decreased stroke volume. Coronary perfusion gradients and myocardial oxygen demand proportionally changed: r= 0. 62 — 0. 77 (p< 0. 001). Oxygen transport significantly unchanged due to alveolar mobilization. After the latter, there was a close correlation between oxygen delivery and uptake (r= 0. 74; p< 0. 001). After alveolar mobilization, the changes in <b>oxygen</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>coefficient</b> and cardiac index had a significant correlation (r= 0. 43; p= 0. 02). After switching to artificial ventilation in the fitted mode, all the study parameters {{did not differ from}} the baseline values. Conclusion. The production of the peak airway pressure required for alveolar mobilization is attended by cardiac depression due to the right and left ventricular function determinant changes resulting in reductions in stroke volume and blood pressure. At the same time, there is imbalance between the conditions for coronary blood flow and the myocardial oxygen demand values.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{specific}} features of oxygen transport function in patients with various oxygen delivery changes caused by alveolar opening maneuver (mobilization) performed early after extracorporeal circulation. Subjects and methods. Alveolar opening maneuver {{was made in the}} presence of relative arterial hypoxemia under the control of dynamic thora-copulmonary compliance. The maximum airway pressure was as high as 31. 1 ± 0. 3 cm H 2 O; the positive end-expiratory pressure was 16. 0 ± 0. 3 cm H 2 O. According to the changes in oxygen delivery after alveolar opening maneuver, the investigators retrospectively identified the following groups: 1) (n= 14) with a lower and 2) (n= 15) higher values. The groups did not differ in age (53. 6 ± 2. 8 and 56. 4 ± 1. 8 years), extracorporeal circulation duration (106. 4 ± 11. 2 and 86. 8 ± 4 min), and inotropic support intensity (4. 7 ± 0. 5 and 4. 6 ± 0. 6 ^g/kh/min for dopamine and/or dobutamine) (p> 0. 05). The mode of alveolar opening maneuver and its impact on thoracopulmonary compliance and pulmonary oxygenizing function were identical in the groups (p> 0. 05). Results. 48. 3 % of the patients with relative arterial hypoxemia show a linear relationship between the oxygen delivery and consumption indices (r= 0. 73; p= 0. 003), and there was a close inverse correlation between the <b>oxygen</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>coefficient</b> and intrapulmonary shunting (r=- 0. 77; p= 0. 001). After alveolar opening maneuver, the oxygen delivery index decreased in these cases from 440. 7 ± 31. 7 to 376. 9 ± 20. 4 ml/min/m 2 (p< 0. 05). The time course °f changes oxygen delivery influenced mixed venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation (r=- 0. 71; p= 0. 005), which was related to lactatemia before (r= 0. 71; p= 0. 004) and after (r= 0. 7; p= 0. 005) alveolar opening maneuver. Conclusion. After extracorporeal circulation, relative arterial hypoxemia may be concurrent with the signs of oxygen transport system tension in patients with impaired pulmonary oxygenizing function. Moreover, regional blood flow impairments in the peripheral tissues and those in the lung are closely related. After alveolar opening maneuver that improves pulmonary oxygenizing function, oxygen delivery decreases, affecting mixed venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation. The findings give grounds to recommend close monitoring and timely correction during alveolar mobilization in the early period after cardiosurgery. The specific features of oxygen transport and utilization during standard interventions into the heart under extracorporeal circulation call for further in-depth studies.

BarstowThe {{physiological}} mechanisms {{determining the}} tolerable duration of exercise dictate human physical accomplishments across all spectrums of life. Despite extensive study, these specific mechanisms, and {{their dependence on}} oxygen delivery and <b>oxygen</b> <b>utilization,</b> remain, a certain extent, undefined. The purpose of this dissertation was to test the overarching hypothesis that muscle contraction characteristics (i. e., intensity of contraction, muscle contraction-relaxation duty cycle, etc.) alter oxygen delivery and <b>oxygen</b> <b>utilization,</b> which directly influence the power-duration relationship and fatigue development, and therefore, exercise tolerance. To accomplish this, specific interventions of altered muscle contraction-relaxation duty cycle and blood flow occlusion were utilized. In the first investigation (Chapter 2), we utilized low and high muscle contraction-relaxation duty cycles to alter {{blood flow to the}} active skeletal muscle, demonstrating that critical power (CP) was reduced with the high muscle contraction-relaxation duty cycle due to a reduction in blood flow, while the curvature constant (W’) was not altered. The second investigation (Chapter 3) utilized blood flow occlusion to show that CP was reduced and W’ increased for blood flow occlusion exercise conditions compared to control blood flow exercise conditions. The final investigation (Chapter 4) utilized periods of blood flow occlusion during and post-exercise to reveal greater magnitudes of peripheral and central fatigue development during blood flow occlusion exercise compared to control blood flow exercise. Moreover, this investigation demonstrated that W’ was significantly related to the magnitude of fatigue development. Collectively, alterations in oxygen delivery and <b>oxygen</b> <b>utilization</b> via muscle contraction characteristics and blood flow occlusion directly influence CP and the magnitude of fatigue development. However, W’ {{does not appear to be}} influenced by manipulations in oxygen delivery and <b>oxygen</b> <b>utilization,</b> per se.

The municipal sewage treatment plant is located at the northern edge of Lincoln. The plant is designed for primary and secondary treatment. The effluent is discharged into the Salt Creek. Salt Creek is a perennial stream that flows into the Platte River. The raw sewage entering the treatment plant passes through a bar screen before entering the wet well. The sewage is pumped from the wet well to a distribution box. A venturi tube placed in the pipe between the wet well and distribution box measures the influent flow. From the distribution box the sewage flows into aerated grit chambers which remove grit and provide pre-aeration. Following pre-aeration, the sewage flows to primary sedimentation tanks and then into the secondary treatment systems. Sludge disposal is by anaerobic digestion and vacuum filtration. Performance tests consist of dissolved oxygen measurements and determinations of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>utilization</b> rate at design loadings.

Tissue P 2 measurements, obtained simultaneously with NADH imaging in area CA 1 in hippocampal slices, reveal that during prolonged train stimulation (ST) in 95 % O 2, a persistent NADH oxidation is coupled with increased metabolic demand and <b>oxygen</b> <b>utilization,</b> {{for the duration of the}} stimulation.

In order {{to clarify the}} effect of Pomacea canaliculata on macrophytes in paddy fields, feeding preference and nutrients utilization of snail were studied. Feeding preference of snail was Alternanthera philoxenoides>Monochoria vaginalis>Oryza sativa L. Snail showed a higher approximate digestion coefficient on Oryza sativa L. than that on Monochoria vaginalis. Nitrogen <b>utilization</b> <b>coefficient</b> of snail on Alternanthera philoxenoides {{was significantly higher than}} that on Oryza sativa L. Snail exhibited a higher calcium <b>utilization</b> <b>coefficient</b> on Alternanthera philoxenoides and Monochoria vaginalis than that on Oryza sativa L. Oryza sativa L. was not preferred among three plants under the same available and exposure condition...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} main {{indices of}} fuel utilization efficiency in energy systems. The basic emphasis is made on {{investigations of the}} existing fuel utilization efficiency indices in the Belarusian energy system. The investigation is resulted in a coefficient of useful fuel utilization, which allows to inter-relate the efficiency of electrical and heat energy generation with the Belenergo energy saving special-purpose index. The useful fuel <b>utilization</b> <b>coefficient</b> can be calculated both with and without taking into consideration the annual actual saving of conditional fuel in the Belenergo system {{that makes it possible}} to determine the influence of the Belenergo energy saving measures on the useful fuel <b>utilization</b> <b>coefficient</b> in the Belarusian energy system. </p...|$|R
