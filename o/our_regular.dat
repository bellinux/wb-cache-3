500|$|Voice actress Marcia Mitzman Gaven {{was hired}} to fill in for Roswell's characters, {{including}} Maude in this episode and the earlier episodes of the eleventh season, although the producers decided to kill her off to open up new storylines for the show. Executive producer Mike Scully said it [...] "was a chance for one of <b>our</b> <b>regular</b> characters [...] to face a challenge and grow in a new direction. The idea came up quickly, we all latched on to it, and it just felt right. We didn't want to kill a character {{for the sake of}} killing. We wanted it to have consequences for surviving characters to deal with in future episodes." [...] Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 after reaching a deal with Fox to record her lines from her home in Denver. Since returning, she has voiced Maude in flashbacks and as a ghost. When asked by The Denver Post on how she thought Ned was doing without Maude, she replied: [...] "OK. But Maude was such a vulnerable character. Maude and Lisa and Marge were the only vulnerable characters, really, everybody else has an edge. So they [...] discovered that arc was lost, and now {{there are a lot of}} flashbacks with Maude." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bret Harris, {{author of}} Ella, Ella, Ella, criticised Campese's {{positional}} play at full-back, and praised New Zealand's backs, in particular All Black centre Steve Pokere, for their tactical kicking. In My Game Your Game Campese defended his 'general play', but highlighted this Test as his 'first bitter experience' playing rugby union at Test match level: [...] "My first bitter experience was in 1983, {{when we played}} the All Blacks at the Sydney Cricket Ground in a one-off Bledisloe Cup game. My general play was fine, but we {{had gone into the}} game without a recognised goal-kicker. <b>Our</b> <b>regular</b> fullback Roger Gould was injured and yours truly was given the job. None out of four was the end result and the All Blacks won the Test 18–8, despite Australia scoring two tries to one. The press had a great time with that one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Good Game {{describes}} Good Game: Pocket Edition as an [...] "add-on pack" [...] and [...] "our concise edition – {{a weekly}} accessory to <b>our</b> <b>regular</b> shows, Good Game and Spawn Point". The episodes are around 10 minutes long, and aim to [...] "give busy gamers a handy round-up of all that's been good in gaming". The Pocket Edition tab {{of the main}} page explains that the show is [...] "our chance to chat a bit more about the games we're currently playing, round up the week's reviews, and even spend a bit more time answering your gaming queries at the GG desk." [...] It acts as an [...] "accessory" [...] to both parent shows, Good Game and Spawn Point, and as such often takes bits of reviews from them, but sometimes has original content as well. The show rarely has any other segments than the main game reviews (due to being about a third {{the length of a}} normal show), besides Ask Good Game and the P.E.-exclusive You Review – where Bajo and Hex read out user reviews of a reviewed game from one of the parent shows' previous episode.|$|E
2500|$|Ortmann is most {{remembered for}} his role in the famed 1950 Snow Bowl game against Ohio State, in which he punted 24 times in a {{blizzard}} for 723 yards – still a Michigan record. The weather conditions were so inclement that Michigan punted on first down for its first two plays from scrimmage, after concluding that the best strategy was to keep the slick ball on the other side of the field and in the hands of Ohio State. The strategy worked, as the game's only touchdown was scored after Ortman punted the ball out of bounds at the Ohio State six-yard line, Ohio State was forced to punt from deep in its own territory, and Tony Momsen recovered a blocked punt in the endzone. Ortmann recalled: “You and I would not have gone outside to get the newspaper on a day like that. [...] But here we were, trying to play football.” Michigan did not get a first down and had only 27 yards of total offense, while Ortman was 0 for 8 passing and gained only 9 yards in 10 rushing attempts. The fierce weather conditions stifled both offenses, and the Wolverines managed to win 9-3 on a safety and Momsen's touchdown after the blocked punt. Interviewed about the Snow Bowl in 2006, Ortmann, then retired and living in Savannah, Georgia, recalled: [...] "Twice during the game, playing as the safety, I couldn't see [...] Vic Janowicz and his backfield, the snow was falling so heavily. Tony Momsen was <b>our</b> <b>regular</b> punter and as we were ready to go out, he said, ‘Charlie, I don't feel like punting today, you punt.' I hadn't punted in three months. But the hero of that game was not Chuck Ortmann, it was Carl Kreager, our center. I just put my hands down and the ball was always there. I still remind him every time we talk, 'Carl, you never got enough credit for that game.' It was so boring. I have a film of the game, and I haven't watched it since, if that tells you something." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the Memorandum's {{signing the}} U.S. has {{transferred}} 3,082 detainees to Afghan control according to Afghan Army General Ghulam Farouk. He said on September 10, 2012 that the U.S. {{was in the}} process of transferring the remaining 30 inmates picked up before the memorandum was signed plus another 600 captured after the signing. But a few weeks ago, the U.S. stopped all transfers. A coalition official told CNN the United States is holding on to several Afghan detainees because of concerns about whether Afghan authorities will properly handle their cases and under what circumstances they might be released. The U.S. also is keeping several prisoners of other nationalities who were not part of the agreement the source said. [...] "Some 99 percent of the detainees captured before 9 March have already been transferred to Afghan authority, but we have paused the transfer of the remaining detainees until our concerns are met," [...] said Jamie Graybeal, a spokesman for the U.S.-led military coalition. Graybeal would not describe the concerns, but a report released in early September 2012 by the New York-based Open Society Foundations said the rift was over whether the Afghans will have a so-called [...] "internment" [...] system that allows some detainees to be held without charge or trial. The U.S. has been holding detainees in internment at Bagram for years. Although the Afghan government agreed to embrace an internment system by signing the accord in March, some top Afghan officials and legal experts contend it violates the Afghan constitution, the report said. Moreover, Karzai himself is opposed to administrative detention (Detaines are held without access to lawyers, public trials or other legal rights), according to the report. The U.S. is now worried that the Afghan government will discontinue internment and either release dangerous detainees or forward their cases to the loosely run Afghan judicial system, which is tainted by corruption and secrecy, the group said. [...] "There are concerns on the U.S. side about division in the Afghan government over internment and that it is not constitutional," [...] said Rachel Reid, a senior policy adviser on Afghanistan for the Open Society Foundations. [...] "The basic concern is that if they don't have internment, they will be released." [...] On the flip side of the legal issue, some Afghan legal experts are worried about Afghan officials abusing any authority to hold detainees without trial. [...] "Consider the fact that even <b>our</b> <b>regular</b> laws are ignored by powerful people," [...] said Abdul Qawi Afzali of the Legal Aid Organization Afghanistan. [...] "What will happen when you give them the actual, legal power to detain people like this law does?" ...|$|E

40|$|Regular Expressions are generic {{representations}} for {{a string}} or {{a collection of}} strings. This paper focuses on implementation of a regular expression matching architecture on reconfigurable fabric like FPGA. We present a Nondeterministic Finite Automata based implementation with extended regular expression syntax set compared to previous approaches. We also describe a dynamically reconfigurable generic block that implements the supported regular expression syntax. This enables formation of the regular expression hardware by a simple cascade of generic blocks {{as well as a}} possibility for reconfiguring the generic blocks to change the regular expression being matched. Further,we have developed an HDL code generator to obtain the VHDL description of the hardware for any <b>regular</b> expression set. <b>Our</b> optimized <b>regular</b> expression engine achieves a throughput of 2. 45 Gbps. <b>Our</b> dynamically reconfigurable <b>regular</b> expression engine achieves a throughput of 0. 8 Gbps using 12 FPGA slices per generic block on Xilinx Virtex 2 Pro FPGA...|$|R
