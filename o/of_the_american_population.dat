Super Bowl XLVI was watched by an estimated average audience of 111.3 million US viewers and an estimated total audience of 166.8 million, according to Nielsen, meaning that over half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>population</b> watched {{at least some of}} the initial broadcast.

Thus, the top 20% of Americans owned 85% of the country's wealth and the bottom 80% of the population owned 15% —an example of the Pareto principle. Financial inequality (total net worth minus the value of one's home) was greater than inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population owning 42.7%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50.3%, and the bottom 80% owning 7%.|$|E
25|$|A Pew report {{released}} in 2009 noted that nearly {{six out of}} ten American adults see Muslims as being subject to discrimination, more than Mormons, Atheists, or Jews.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the new prosperity, {{consumer}} expenditures rose by nearly 50%, from $61.7billion {{at the start of the}} war to $98.5billion by 1944. Individual savings accounts climbed almost sevenfold during the course of the war. The share of total income held by the top 5% of wage earners fell from 22% to 17%, while the bottom 40% increased their share of the economic pie. In addition, during the course of the war, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>population</b> earning less than $3,000 (in 1968 dollars) fell by half.|$|E
25|$|Human population, if {{the number}} of births and deaths per person per year were to remain at current levels (but also see {{logistic}} growth). For example, according to the United States Census Bureau, over the last 100 years (1910 to 2010), the population of the United States of America is exponentially increasing at an average rate of one and a half percent a year (1.5%). This means that the doubling time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>population</b> (depending on the yearly growth in population) is approximately 50 years.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the Vietnam War a large segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>population</b> came to be opposed to U.S. {{involvement}} in South Vietnam. Public opinion steadily turned against the war following 1967, and by 1970 only a third of Americans believed that the U.S. had not made a mistake by sending troops to fight in Vietnam. During the late-1960s opponents of the war turned to teach-ins and street protests, such as those at the 1968 Democratic National Convention and the 1969 Vietnam Moratorium, in an effort to turn U.S. political opinion.|$|E

25|$|Before 1840 Catholics {{constituted}} {{a small minority}} and therefore played a relatively minor role in early American history. Only in Maryland were there significant numbers, and Baltimore became an early Catholic center. During the American Revolution until the late 18th century, about 1% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>population</b> (about 30,000) was Catholic. Still, Catholics were among the Founding Fathers {{and part of the}} First Congress; Daniel Carroll serving Maryland's 6th congressional district, and Charles Carroll of Carrollton serving as the first senator from Maryland. Presidential candidates did not seek Catholic votes until Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay did so in 1832.|$|E
25|$|Income {{and wealth}} {{statistics}} {{may serve as}} a helpful guideline as they can be measured in a more objective manner. In 2005, approximately one and a half percent (1.5%) of households in the United States had incomes exceeding $250,000 with the top 5% having incomes exceeding $157,000. Furthermore, only 2.6% of households held assets (excluding home equity) of more than one-million dollars. One could therefore fall under the assumption that less than five percent of American society are members of rich households. The richest 1% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>population</b> owns as much as the combined wealth of the bottom 90%, or perhaps even more.|$|E
25|$|Suppressing a {{rebellion}} in America presented the British with major problems. The key issue was distance; {{it could take}} up to three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated {{by the time that}} they arrived. The colonies had never been formally united prior to the conflict and there was no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance. Traditionally, the fall of a capital city often signalled the end of a conflict, yet the war continued unabated even after the fall of major settlements such as New York, Philadelphia (which was the Patriot capital), and Charleston. Britain's ability to project its power overseas lay chiefly {{in the power of the}} Royal Navy, allowing her to control major coastal settlements with relative ease and enforce a strong blockade of colonial ports. However, the overwhelming majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>population</b> was agrarian, not urban. As a result, the American economy proved resilient enough to withstand the blockade's effects.|$|E
