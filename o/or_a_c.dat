50|$|Khlui phiang aw is {{the most}} popular among all types of khlui. It has a {{moderate}} range of pitch, not too high or low. It is a reed-less aerophone with 8 tone holes. At mouthpiece there is a solid wooden block ("dak"ดาก) with a small aperture instead of a reed. The dak has the diameter of the tube and usually have the length of 2 inches,and was inserted at an end of the tube. On the side of the dak there is a square-shaped hole creates the sound of the khlui called รูปากนกแก้ว. The khlui has 7 finger holes and a thumb hole. The khlui phiang aw {{is one of the oldest}} woodwind instruments. Its origin could be dated back to around the first century. At present, khlui usually have a very high price, because the wood is more scarced. So, plastic is used to create more conventional use. Khlui is tuned an octave higher than the middle C. The khlui phiang aw is usually tuned as a Bb khlui <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>C</b> khlui. The Bb khlui is a traditional one that is used to play Thai songs and with Thai ensemble, while the C Khlui is later modified to adapt the western chromatic scale. Both types are very common. However, traditional Thai Khlui is slightly more flat than the ideal Bb, but well-tuned khlui also exists. The khlui phiang aw {{is the most}} popular in all Thai instruments, and is widely used for recreational purposes.|$|E

40|$|DNA lesion bypass is an {{important}} cellular response to genomic damage during replication. Human DNA polymerase η (Polη), encoded by the Xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV) gene, {{is known for its}} activity of error-free translesion synthesis opposite a TT cis-syn cyclobutane dimer. Using purified human Polη, we have examined bypass activities of this polymerase opposite several other DNA lesions. Human Polη efficiently bypassed a template 8 -oxoguanine, incorporating an A <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>C</b> opposite the lesion with similar efficiencies. Human Polη effectively bypassed a template abasic site, incorporating an A and less frequently a G opposite the lesion. Significant – 1 deletion was also observed when the template base 5 ′ to the abasic site is a T. Human Polη partially bypassed a template (+) -trans-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-N 2 -dG and predominantly incorporated an A, less frequently a T, and least frequently a G <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>C</b> opposite the lesion. This specificity of nucleotide incorporation correlates well with the known mutation spectrum of (+) -trans-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-N 2 -dG lesion in mammalian cells. These results show that human Polη is capable of error-prone translesion DNA syntheses in vitro and suggest that Polη may bypass certain lesions with a mutagenic consequence in humans...|$|E
