This effectively marked the end of the Brezhnev Doctrine.

5|$|As {{a result}} of deteriorating {{conditions}} in the city attributed to French governance, the unpopular establishment <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> law, and the propaganda efforts of the rebels and their Turkish backers, many neighborhood leaders in Aleppo decided to recruit men to join Hananu's rebels, {{while many of the}} city's landowners and merchants donated funds to the rebel cause. The presence of 5,000 French Senegalese troops prevented an urban revolt that specifically targeted French forces, but in numerous incidents, Muslims from Aleppo's lower-income neighborhoods, such as Bab al-Nairab, violently assaulted members of the city's large Christian minority because they were viewed as being associated with French interests.|$|E

5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E

The Commander in Chief of the army, Khalifa bin Ahmed, was given wide authority with the announcement <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> law; he led a main crackdown operation, presided over military courts and made several interviews with regional and local media.

The crackdown empowered the Khawalid brothers faction further and marginalized the CP, who found himself and allies stripped from their powers.|$|E

40|$|This article re-examines the {{interactions}} <b>of</b> <b>Martial’s</b> epigram 11. 104 with Ovidian poetry. While previous interpretations have been {{primarily concerned with}} Martial’s manifest allusion to the Ars amatoria in this epigram, its hitherto neglected relations to Ovid’s Remedia amoris are here taken into consideration. The case is made that Martial systematically alludes to motifs from Ars amatoria as well as Amores in order to confront them with their respective reworkings in the Remedia. Thus, Martial’s epigram gives an exemplary reading of the Remedia as an inversion of Ovid’s former works. Ultimately, this engagement with Ovid’s Remedia stands in the service <b>of</b> <b>Martial’s</b> Saturnalian poetics...|$|R

Immediately after the state of emergency was invoked, Bhutto returned to Pakistan, while Zardari again stayed behind in Dubai. Emergency rule was initiated right before the Supreme Court of Pakistan began deliberations on the legality of Musharraf's U.S.-backed proposal—the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO)—to drop corruption charges against Bhutto and Zardari in return for a joint Bhutto-Musharraf coalition to govern Pakistan. Bhutto and Zardari sympathised with Musharraf on his feud with the Supreme Court, but simultaneously criticised the imposition <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> law. Before the Supreme Court could issue a decision, Musharraf replaced its members with his supporters.|$|E
