40|$|Few would {{dispute the}} {{existence}} of a general tendency to blame psychological ailments on physical problems. For example, we often attribute changes in mood to the somatic effects of the weather, irritability to diet, apathy to physical exhaustion, etc. How many of us can deny at some time having attempted to explain to our spouses that an <b>outburst</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper</b> was really the fault of our indigestion, let us say? Of course, our spouses are rather skeptical. And as psychiatrists we too preserve a skepticism towards the explanations of this kind which our patients so often provide. This {{is not to say that}} we render meaningless the influence of somatic factors on the psyche, but only to acknowledge that unconscious processes operate in devious and wily ways, and that a psychological principle independent of these psychosomatic relations seems to be hard at work. In extreme cases, excessive and overriding concern for physical status is unequivocally indicative of a major psychiatric disturbance- and the processes of denial and displacement are observable in purer culture, as it were. But we must not ignore the attempt at self-cure inherent in such tendencies, the acknowledgment of which might lead to efficacious therapeutic interventions. Indeed, as resident psychiatrists, circumstances permit us to practice a type of brief psychotherapy which has long been utilized, albeit in an uncomprehending, intuitive manner. Glover (1931) had laid th e theoretic groundwork for the technique I am about to describe, in his brilliant and far-reaching paper on inexact interpretation (the perusal of which is strongly recommended to the reader), which consequently warrants a brief discussion...|$|E
50|$|In Eidelberg's view, {{a normal}} {{individual}} would usually {{be able to}} avoid being overwhelmed by internal needs because they recognize these urges in time to bring about their partial discharge. However, Eidelberg does not view occasional <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper</b> as a sign of disorder. An individual experiencing pathological narcissistic mortification is prone to become fixated on infantile objects, resulting in an infantile form of discharge. He or she cannot be satisfied by the partial discharge of this energy, which takes place on an unconscious level, and this in turn interferes with their well-being. According to Eidelberg, the denial of an infantile narcissistic mortification can be responsible for many defensive mechanisms.|$|R

50|$|By the mid-1940s, Mack began showing unmistakable {{signs of}} mental deterioration.

Also during this time, Mack gave a minority stake in the team to his sons, Roy, Earle and Connie, Jr. Although Connie, Jr. was several years younger than Roy and Earle (he was the son of Connie, Sr.'s second marriage), Mack intended to have all three of them inherit the team upon his death. He also intended for Earle, who had been assistant manager since 1924, to succeed him as manager. This decision would have dire consequences for the A's later on.|$|R
50|$|In his panegyric on Origen, Gregory {{describes}} the method employed by that master {{to win the}} confidence and esteem of those he wished to convert; how he mingled a persuasive candour with <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper</b> and theological argument put cleverly at once and unexpectedly. Persuasive skill rather than bare reasoning, and evident sincerity and an ardent conviction were the means Origen used to make converts. Gregory took up at first the study of philosophy; theology was afterwards added, but his mind remained always inclined to philosophical study, so much so indeed that in his youth he cherished strongly the hope of demonstrating that the Christian religion was the only true and good philosophy. For seven years he underwent the mental and moral discipline of Origen (231 to 238 or 239). There {{is no reason to}} believe that his studies were interrupted by the persecutions of Maximinus of Thrace; his alleged journey to Alexandria, at this time, may therefore be considered at least doubtful, and probably never occurred.|$|R

50|$|After Pope Gregory XI died in 1378, the Romans rioted {{to ensure}} the {{election}} of a Roman for pope. On April 8, 1378 the cardinals elected a Neapolitan when no viable Roman candidates presented themselves. Urban VI, born Bartolomeo Prignano, the Archbishop of Bari, was elected. Urban had been a respected administrator in the papal chancery at Avignon, but as pope he proved suspicious, reformist, and prone to violent <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper.</b> Many <b>of</b> the cardinals who had elected him soon regretted their decision: the majority removed themselves from Rome to Anagni, where, even though Urban was still reigning, they elected Robert of Geneva as a rival pope on September 20 of the same year. Robert took the name Clement VII and reestablished a papal court in Avignon. The second election threw the Church into turmoil. There had been antipopes—rival claimants to the papacy—before, but most of them had been appointed by various rival factions; in this case, a single group of leaders of the Church had created both the pope and the antipope.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the course}} of the novel, working in the {{hospital}} takes a psychological toll on Basch. His personality and outlook change, and he has <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper.</b> He has adulterous trysts with various nurses (portrayed in great detail) and social service workers (nicknamed the [...] "Sociable Cervix") and his relationship with his girlfriend Berry suffers. A colleague, Wayne Potts, who had been constantly badgered by the upper hierarchy and haunted by a patient (nicknamed [...] "The Yellow Man" [...] for his fulminant necrotic hepatitis, who goes comatose and eventually dies possibly because Potts had not put him on steroids), commits suicide. Basch becomes more callous and he secretly euthanizes a patient, a man called Saul the leukemic tailor, whose illness had gone into remission but was back in the hospital in incredible pain and begging for death. Basch becomes more and more emotionally unstable, until finally his friends force him to attend a mime performance by Marcel Marceau, where he has an experience of catharsis and recovers his emotional stability.|$|R
25|$|On Berlioz's {{return to}} Paris, a concert {{including}} Symphonie fantastique (which had been extensively revised in Italy) and Le retour à la vie was performed, with Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, Heinrich Heine, Niccolò Paganini, Franz Liszt, Frédéric Chopin, George Sand, Alfred de Vigny, Théophile Gautier, Jules Janin, Harriet Smithson {{and others in}} the audience. At this time, Berlioz also met playwright Ernest Legouvé who became a lifelong friend. A few days after the performance, Berlioz and Harriet were finally introduced and entered into a relationship. Despite Berlioz not understanding spoken English and Harriet not knowing any French, on 3 October 1833, they got married in a civil ceremony at the British Embassy with Liszt as one of the witnesses. The following year their only child, Louis Berlioz, was born– a source of initial disappointment, anxiety and eventual pride to his father. Unfortunately for Berlioz, he was soon to discover that living under the same roof as his beloved wife was far less appealing than worship from afar. Their marriage turned out a disaster as both were prone to violent personality clashes and <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper.</b>|$|R

Their relationship ended when she began a passionate but platonic relationship with Jean Cocteau who like Lifar, and most men she was attracted to, was homosexual. Cocteau wanted to marry her and have a child with her, but Princess Natalia declined the offer. Their affair ended in the fall of 1932. She bought an apartment on the Esplanade des Invalides where she entertained society and prominent artists. She continued to work as a photographic model in connection with Lelong's fashion house. In the spring of 1933 she began to pursue a film career. She studied acting with Belgian actress, Eve Francis, the former wife of director Louis Delluc.|$|R

He made no attempt to cultivate a public image. He was neither oracle, orator nor professional wit, but he expressed himself with trenchancy, and his gentlemanly self-control was occasionally ruffled by storms of anger. ... There were nights when the physical impact of his conducting was low, and there was little beyond faithfulness to the notes.

60|$|Had he reproached her gently, {{she would}} have frankly {{admitted}} this, and would have asked him to forgive her for changing her mind now that years had wrought a change in her feelings; but the harshness and suddenness of his attack had roused her pride, and driven her {{to take up the}} ground that there was no formal engagement between them, and that as he had not renewed the subject for years she was at perfect liberty to consider herself free. She had spoken but the truth in saying that their near relationship was in her eyes a bar to their marriage. Of late years she had thought much more than she had when a girl over the history of the family and the curse of the Carnes, and although she had tried her best to prevent herself from brooding over the idea, she could not disguise from herself that her brother was at times strange and unlike other men, and her recollections <b>of</b> Ronald's <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper,</b> as a boy, induced the suspicion that he, too, had not altogether escaped the fatal taint.

40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed Objective: We investigated electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of moderate Intermittent Explosive Disorder (mIED), which is characterized by uncontrollable, impulsive attacks that either manifest in aggressive <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper,</b> or in implosive, auto-aggressive behaviour. Methods: In two Experiments, EEG data were recorded during rest conditions, and while subjects were presented with auditory and visual stimuli. Additionally, scores of the I 7 impulsivity scale (designed to capture acting on impulse) were obtained. Results: In Experiment 1, individuals with mIED showed a stronger increase {{in the power of}} oscillatory activity in the beta band, along with a stronger power decrease in the theta band in response to both visual and auditory stimuli. Based on discriminant function analysis, a model of discriminant functions was derived that clearly separated the mIED group from the control group. In Experiment 2, subjects were categorized into either of two groups (supposedly without mIED, with mIED) based on this model of discriminant functions. Results showed that I 7 impulsivity scores clearly differed between groups. Conclusion: The present data show a relation between oscillatory brain activity and mIED. They indicate that this brain activity is related to the impulsivity facet of impulsive action, and suggest that mIED can be assessed based on the analysis of electrophysiological data. Significance: To our knowledge, this is the first study on EEG correlates of (m) IED. Results open up new perspectives for future investigations on disorders characterized by substantial impulsivity...|$|R
60|$|On {{the adverse}} {{side of the}} question, he {{expressed}} his conviction that Mrs. Lecount had certainly detected her visitor to be disguised; {{that she had never}} really left the room, though she might have opened and shut the door; and that on both the occasions, therefore, when Magdalen had been betrayed into speaking in her own voice, Mrs. Lecount had heard her. On the favorable side of the question, he was perfectly satisfied that the painted face and eyelids, the wig, and the padded cloak had so effectually concealed Magdalen's identity, that she might in her own person defy the housekeeper's closest scrutiny, so far as the matter of appearance was concerned. The difficulty of deceiving Mrs. Lecount's ears, as well as her eyes, was, he readily admitted, not so easily to be disposed of. But looking to the fact that Magdalen, on both the occasions when she had forgotten herself, had spoken in the heat of anger, he was of opinion that her voice had every reasonable chance of escaping detection, if she carefully avoided all <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> <b>temper</b> for the future, and spoke in those more composed and ordinary tones which Mrs. Lecount had not yet heard.
