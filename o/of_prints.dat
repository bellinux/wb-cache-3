5|$|Boydell's {{crowning}} achievement was his Shakespeare project, {{which was to}} occupy {{much of the last}} two decades of his life.

40|$|Abstract The color {{reproduction}} {{is based on}} visual perception. The psychophysics experiments present the light source; illuminants and view background affect the results of color matching. Paper is a typical substrate for printed color matching and effects printed color greatly.

This paper used CAT 02 chromatic adaptation models to transform the measurements <b>of</b> <b>printed</b> color in paper with and without OBA, compared the effect <b>of</b> <b>printed</b> color matching between before and after transforming with display, present the method using chromatic adaptation transforms to improve the accurate <b>of</b> <b>printed</b> color matching...|$|R

5|$|All {{thirteen}} known Ruisdael etchings {{come from}} his early period, {{with the first}} one dated 1646. It is unknown who taught him the art of etching. No etchings exist signed by his father, his uncle, or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom, who influenced his other work. His etchings show little influence from Rembrandt, either in style or technique. Few original impressions exist; five etchings survive in only a single impression. The rarity <b>of</b> <b>prints</b> suggests that Ruisdael considered them trial essays, which did not warrant large editions. The etching expert Georges Duplessis singled out Grainfield at the Edge of a Wood and The Travellers as unrivalled illustrations of Ruisdael's genius.|$|E
5|$|Boxwood {{cut across}} the end-grain is hard enough for fine engraving, {{allowing}} greater detail than in normal woodcutting. This been the dominant method used since Bewick's time. In addition, since a wood engraving is inked on the face, it requires only low pressure to print an image, so the blocks last for many thousands <b>of</b> <b>prints,</b> and importantly can be assembled into a page of metal type for ordinary printing in a single run. In contrast, a copper plate engraving is inked in the engraved grooves, the face being wiped clean of ink before printing, so much higher pressure is required, and images must be printed separately from the text, at far greater expense.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Briarcliff {{resident}} and artist Myril Adler proposed {{a series of}} exhibits of graphic art; the first showing was in October of that year and recurred each month thereafter, each with Sunday opening receptions. Exhibitors included Adler, Michael Ponce de Leon, Seong Moy, Rodolfo Abularach, Fritz Eichenberg, Jacob Landau, George Earl Ortman, Minna Citron, and Alfredo Da Silva. Exhibited works included etchings and engravings, woodcuts, cellocuts, lithographs, collage intaglios, and serigraphs. As {{a result of these}} exhibits, the library began a collection <b>of</b> <b>prints</b> donated by the exhibiting artists. In the library's small space, Adler displayed prints between shelves and in the youth and children's reading rooms.|$|E
