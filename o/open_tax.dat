[...] Successive governments in the British Virgin Islands have fought against the tax haven label, and made various commitments to tax exchange and recording beneficial ownership information of companies following the 2013 G8 summit.

[...] Mr Cameron's comments were interpreted as a direct reference to Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, and followed a period of negotiations with those (and other) British territories during which those jurisdictions had made a number of concessions relating to tax transparency and sharing of information. [...] Anti-tax haven pressure groups immediately accused the Prime Minister of taking leave of his senses, and commenting sarcastically [...] "It was Cameron's father's tax haven activities that are repotted sic to have paid for his Eton education.

This is because the presence of a terms of trade externality introduces efficient fluctuations in the consumption-leisure wedge driven by movements in the real exchange rate.
