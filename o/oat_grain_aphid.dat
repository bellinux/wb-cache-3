40|$|Insects {{are often}} {{infected}} with facultative endosymbiotic bacteria, which {{can have a}} range of important ecological effects. The <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> Sitobion avenae, harbours diverse facultative symbionts, which suggests their importance in <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> biology. This thesis attempts to explain the ecological roles of the facultative endosymbionts in S. avenae. It also examines {{the question of whether the}} horizontal transmission of symbionts between aphid clones and species can be important for shaping the ecology and evolution of multi-species aphid communities. Novel techniques developed for research with the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> study system are presented. <b>Grain</b> <b>aphid</b> clones vary in their tolerance to low temperatures, but this trait is not affected by their facultative endosymbionts. Strains of a symbiont Hamiltonella defensa do not protect <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> from hymenopterous parasitoids, regardless of the host genotype. However, experienced parasitoid females preferentially oviposit in aphids which do not harbour symbionts. Comparison of the fitness consequences of infection with the same Hamiltonella strains in their original and in novel <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> host clones reveal no consistent differences. Symbiont strains establish easily following artificial transfer between clones of the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> but the symbionts transferred from other aphid species form less stable infections. Hamiltonella strains do not affect the fecundity of their <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> host clones regardless of their host species of origin, but also do not generally confer protection against parasitoids. There are no clear patterns in the distribution of parasitoid-resistant phenotypes across phylogenetic trees of Hamiltonella and its bacteriophage APSE. Strains of four unrelated species of endosymbionts, Rickettsia, Spiroplasma, Rickettsiella and Regiella, confer the same pathogen-resistant phenotype to a single pea aphid clone. The same symbiont strains can confer resistance to clones of two different aphid species. Some strains in multiple infections may compensate for the costs of infections with other symbionts. The importance of these results for understanding the ecological and evolutionary role of facultative endosymbionts in aphids and other insects are discussed, and directions for further research are proposed.

40|$|Background: The <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> (Sitobion avenae F.) {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} pest {{which causes}} significant yield losses of wheat in China, Europe and North America annually. Transcriptome profiling of the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> alimentary canal after feeding on wheat plants could provide comprehensive gene expression information involved in feeding, ingestion and digestion. Furthermore, selection of aphid-specific RNAi target genes would be essential for utilizing a plant-mediated RNAi strategy to control aphids via a non-toxic mode of action. However, due to the tiny size of the alimentary canal and lack of genomic information on <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> as a whole, selection of the RNAi targets is a challenging task {{that as far as}} we are aware, has never been documented previously. Results: In this study, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and gene expression analyses of the alimentary canals of <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> before and after feeding on wheat plants using Illumina RNA sequencing. The transcriptome profiling generated 30, 427 unigenes with an average length of 664 bp. Furthermore, comparison of the transcriptomes of alimentary canals of pre- and post feeding <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> indicated that 5490 unigenes were differentially expressed, among which, diverse genes and/or pathways were identified and annotated. Based on the RPKM values of these unigenes, 16 of them that were significantly up or down-regulated upon feeding were selected for dsRNA artificial feeding assay. Of these, 5 unigenes led to higher mortality and developmental stunting in an artificial feeding assay due to the down-regulation of the target gene expression. Finally, by adding fluorescently labelled dsRNA into the artificial diet, the spread of fluorescence signal in the whole body tissues of <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> was observed. Conclusions: Comparison of the transcriptome profiles of the alimentary canals of pre- and post-feeding <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> on wheat plants provided comprehensive gene expression information that could facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying feeding, ingestion and digestion. Furthermore, five novel and effective potential RNAi target genes were identified in <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> for the first time. This finding would provide a fundamental basis for aphid control in wheat through plant mediated RNAi strategy. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Oats have {{received}} attention {{because of their}} nutritional characteristics, especially their high-quality content of &# 946;-glucan. The drying process reduces water content; therefore they can be preserved for long periods. However, high-temperature drying process may affect the physical, chemical, and functional properties of the grains. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of different drying temperatures on &# 946;-glucan quality in <b>oat</b> <b>grains.</b> Grains of oats (Avena sativa, L.), cultivar Albasul, harvested at harvest moisture content of 23 % were submitted to stationary drying at air temperatures of 25, 50, 75, and 100 ºC until they reached 13 % moisture content. The &# 946;-glucan content was determined in samples of <b>oat</b> <b>grains</b> and extraction was performed using water as solvent at 90 ºC. The &# 946;-glucan extract was evaluated for water holding capacity, water retention capacity, capacity of displacement, and gelation properties. Stationary of <b>oat</b> <b>grains</b> at air temperatures above 25 ºC decreased the water holding capacity, whereas the content of &# 946;-glucan and the water retention capacity of &# 946;-glucan extract was affected at temperatures above 50 ºC.

Arterial blood was obtained from a catheter inserted into the carotid artery while venous blood was simultaneously collected from a catheter placed into the iliac vein via the medial saphenous vein. The arteriovenous difference for glucose was significant and represented a mean extraction of 10 ± 1 % with no effect of diet. If fully oxidised, glucose uptake (corrected for lactate and pyruvate arteriovenous difference) was sufficient to account for 78 ± 13 % or 107 ± 15 % of the oxygen consumed by the hindlimb in horses fed a roughage or 52 % <b>oat</b> <b>grain</b> diet respectively. Acetate was also a major metabolite of the hindlimb, showing a 39 ± 5 % extraction with no effect of diet. However, the 52 % <b>oat</b> <b>grain</b> diet did induce a significant decline in the concentration of acetate in arterial blood. The potential contribution to oxidation in the hindlimb was significantly reduced from 32 ± 4 % in horses fed roughage to 21 ± 3 % when fed 52 % <b>oat</b> <b>grain.</b> D- 3 -Hydroxybutyrate uptake could account for 9 ± 1 % of the oxidation by the hindlimb with no effect of diet.

40|$|Meteorological {{conditions}} {{are one of}} the environmental factors that greatly influence the level of <b>oat</b> <b>grain</b> yield and quality. The breeding of oat cultivars well adapted to unfavourable climatic conditions gives a chance to make the <b>oat</b> <b>grain</b> yield and quality more stable. The thorough study of the influence of climatic conditions to oat characteristics {{plays a key role in}} breeding for that purpose. The objective of this research was to study the influence of genotype, meteorological conditions, and their interaction on <b>oat</b> <b>grain</b> yield and quality characteristics. Field studies were carried out at the Jõgeva Plant Breeding Institute during 1998 2002. 101 oat cultivars from Germany, Russia, Sweden, Estonia and other countries were included into this trial. Cultivars were grown in three replicated plots of 5 m², precrop was potato. The plots were sown at 500 seeds/m². The fertilizer level used was N 70 P 16 K 25. Results were subjected to analysis of variance. Grain yield and quality characters such as 1000 grain weight, husk content, volume weight and protein content were evaluated. The results indicated that both genotype and meteorological conditions strongly affected <b>oat</b> <b>grain</b> yield and quality characteristics. Grain yield was most affected by the meteorological conditions that made up 60 % of the variation. Both the drought and lodging lowered the <b>oat</b> <b>grain</b> yield considerably. The differences between the cultivars made up 20 % of the variation of the grain yield. The influences of meteorological conditions and varietal differences to the variation of 1000 grain weight and husk content were on the same level. The 1000 grain weight decreased and husk content was high mainly in case of heavy lodging. Volume weight varied mainly (63 %) due to the influence of meteorological conditions. The importance of varietal differences in the variation of this trait was small (16 %). The variation of protein content was mainly (46 %) dependant on varietal differences. The influence of the meteorological conditions on the variation of this trait was only 24 % and the interactions of the two factors 25 %.

The McAb was selected by screening hybridoma lines for antibodies that bound with the semi-digested aphid proteins in ladybirds. A double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) using ClonotypingTM System/HRP showed that it belonged to the IgG 2 a isotype.

It could still detect the semi-digested proteins in the gut of a ladybird adult, kept at 25 °C, that had ingested one aphid 6 days before. The extended antigen detection period and the high specificity of the antibody indicated that EGA- 4 A 9 could be used to study interactions between English <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> and their ladybird predators in the field.

40|$|Background: The {{sesquiterpene}} (E) -ß-farnesene is {{the main}} component of the alarm pheromone system of various aphid species studied to date, including the English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> Sitobion avenae. Aphid natural enemies, such as the marmalade hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus and the multicolored Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis, eavesdrop on aphid chemical communication and utilize (E) -ß-farnesene as a kairomone to localize their immediate or offspring preys. These aphidpredator systems are important models to study how the olfactory systems of distant insect taxa process the same chemical signal. We postulated that odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), which are highly expressed in insect olfactory tissues and involved in the first step of odorant reception, have conserved regions involved in binding (E) -ß-farnesene. Methodology: We cloned OBP genes from the English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> and two major predators of this aphid species. We then expressed these proteins and compare their binding affinities to the alarm pheromone/kairomone. By using a fluorescence reporter, we tested binding of (E) -ß-farnesene and other electrophysiologically and behaviorally active compounds, including a green leaf volatile attractant. Conclusion: We found that OBPs from disparate taxa of aphids and their predators are highly conserved proteins, with apparently no orthologue genes in other insect species. Properly folded, recombinant proteins from the English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> SaveOBP 3, and the marmalade hoverfly, EbalOBP 3, specifically bind (E) -ß-farnesene with apparent high affinity.

40|$|<b>Oats</b> <b>grain</b> from South Africa was {{frequently}} {{found to be}} infested by toxic strains of Fusarium acuminatum, as was one barley sample. All 11 toxic strains tested produced T- 2 toxin (0. 8 to 2, 600 mg/kg), and 6 of 11 strains produced diacetoxyscirpenol (0. 6 to 8. 4 mg/kg). This is the first record of T- 2 toxin-producing Fusarium isolates from Africa and of the production of large amounts of T- 2 toxin at relatively high (25 degrees C) temperatures...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} potential of relay intercropping soybean into oat in Iowa. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the optimum soybean planting date, row spacing, cultivar and oat harvesting date in an oat-soybean relay intercropping system. Two experiments were carried out in 1983, 1984, and 1985. Experiment I included three cropping system row spacings and three soybean planting dates. Experiment II included three soybean cultivars, three cropping system row spacings, and three oat harvesting dates;Relay intercropping soybean into <b>oat</b> significantly reduced <b>grain</b> yields of <b>oat</b> and soybean. The oat plant characters measured were not significantly affected by cropping systems. On the contrary, relay intercropping decreased the performance of all soybean plant characters except for number of branches per plant. Alteration of cropping system row spacing did not affect any soybean plant character, but significantly affected <b>oat</b> <b>grain</b> yield and test weight. The greatest <b>oat</b> <b>grain</b> yield and test weight were obtained when soybean was relay interplanted in 25 -cm cropping system row spacing;Neither soybean planting date nor soybean cultivar had a significant effect on oat plant characters. The opposite was true for soybean plant characters. The earlier the soybean planting date, the greater the grain yield and the larger the seed size of soybean. Soybean cultivar significantly affected soybean plant characters measured, but not the grain yield and soybean plant height at oat harvest. Pella soybean had greater seed weight and plant height than Hobbit and Asgrow 3127 soybean. Regardless of soybean cultivar, the greatest soybean grain yield, seed weight, and plant height were achieved when soybean was relay interplanted in 51 -cm row spacing;Oat harvest at physiological maturity resulted in greater <b>oat</b> <b>grain</b> yield and other plant characters as compared to harvest at harvest maturity. For soybean, the earlier the oat was harvested, the greater the soybean yield and seed weight;Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) values revealed that LER was not affected by either soybean cultivar, soybean row spacing, or oat harvesting date. The LER value of more than unity obtained from this research indicates that relay intercropping of soybean into oat has potential for Iowa...|$|R
