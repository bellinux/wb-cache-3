The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the impact of different types of organizational resources on the severity of <b>organizational</b> <b>problems.</b> A theoretical framework based on the concept of organizational capacity is presented, which explains the influence of human, financial, infrastructure, and cultural resources on <b>organizational</b> <b>problems.</b> The empirical evaluation is undertaken using data from a nationwide online survey of nonprofit sport clubs in Germany (n = 19, 345). The regression results show that human resources (women on the board, secondary volunteers, etc.), financial resources (Herfindahl index), infrastructure resources (own facilities, and public facilities), and cultural resources (e. g., strategic policy, formation policy, value of conviviality, and variety of sports) are significant determinants of <b>organizational</b> <b>problems.</b> The findings of this study have implications for the management of voluntary sport organizations.

[...] In their opinion [...] "economic approaches to organization focus specially on the economic problem of optimal allocation of scarce resources." [...] and [...] "the economic contribution to our understanding of an <b>organizational</b> <b>problem</b> increases when the economic problem forms a greater part of the <b>organizational</b> <b>problem</b> that we are trying to understand." [...] The book systemically compares markets and organizations as coordination mechanisms for conducting transactions. It covers the behavioral theory of the firm, game theory, agency theory, transaction cost economics, the economics of strategy, evolutionary approaches to organizations and complexity economics in a non-technical way. In the sixth edition (2017) the authors explain the impact of digitization on organizations and the business model of digital platforms (like Amazon, Airbnb, Uber).

40|$|The {{most popular}} {{approach}} to developing mathematical models of organizational decision processes, the decomposition approach, {{begins with a}} mathematical statement of an ideal <b>organizational</b> <b>problem</b> and follows a process of decomposition to derive sub-problems solved by separate units at (possibly) different levels of the organization. Conversely, the composition approach starts with mathematical statements of the subproblems solved by the separate units and proceeds to develop a solution algorithm {{as a means of}} coordinating the activities of the separate units. A process of composition must then be followed if one is to discover the derived <b>organizational</b> <b>problem</b> actually solved. This paper offers an operational definition of an organizational decision process and relates this process to the anatomy of mathematical models purported as being representative of it. Implications regarding the potential of the decision process models as tools of organizational design are explored. organizational studies: decomposition, organizational studies: design, organizational studies: decision processes...|$|E
