40|$|A {{versatile}} molecule {{is described}} that performs as a nondestructible read-out optical-storage molecular memory. This molecular memory {{is composed of}} two distinct molecules that are chemically bonded to each other to form a single molecule with unique properties. One component is a photochromic fulgimide, {{and the other is}} a strongly fluorescing <b>oxazine</b> <b>dye.</b> This composite molecule was specifically designed and synthesized to display, under specific conditions, both the photochromic functions of the first component and the fluorescence properties of the dye. To store information, the polar, closed form of the photochromic component is illuminated with 530 -nm light, which converts it to the open, nonpolar form. The information is accessed by excitation at the 650 -nm band of the <b>oxazine</b> <b>dye</b> component, causing the dye to fluoresce. However, the dye emits intense fluorescence under a nonpolar environment, which is attained only when the fulgimide component is in its open, nonpolar structure. The ultrafast kinetics, spectroscopy, and mechanism of the photoreaction of this molecule and its photoinduced intermediates have been measured, and fluorescence quantum yields and cross sections were determined...|$|E

Incoherent light centered at 575 nm {{was used as a}} source for ultrafast measurements on the blue side of the inhomogeneous distribution of the <b>oxazine</b> <b>dye</b> Nile Blue. Under these conditions, a new form of interference was observed as a sinusoidal variation of the DFWM signal versus delay time. A measured interference period of 1. 96 +/- 0. 07 fs corresponds to the optical cycle time of the light source. Numerical solutions for the DFWM intensity confirm the oscillation effect and estimate a measured dephasing time of 2 - 3 fs...|$|E
40|$|The In {{the current}} work we have {{investigated}} the ability of time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) to predict the absorption spectra {{of a series of}} <b>oxazine</b> <b>dyes</b> and the effect of solvent on the accuracy of these predictions. Based on the results of this study, it is clear that for the series of <b>oxazine</b> <b>dyes</b> an accurate prediction of the excitation energy requires the inclusion of solvent. Implicit solvent included via a polarizable continuum approach was found to be sufficient in reproducing the excitation energies accurately in the majority of cases. Moreover, we found that the SMD solvent model, which is dependent on the full electron density of the solute without partitioning into partial charges, gave more reliable results for our systems relative to the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM), as implemented in Gaussian 09. In all cases the inclusion of solvent reduces the error in the predicted excitation energy to < 0. 3 eV and in the majority of cases to < 0. 1 eV...|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} studies {{were performed to}} investigate the behavior of uranium with bacteria in an anaerobic environment. Laboratory studies used Shewanella putrefaciens because {{of its ability to}} grow rapidly in aerobic conditions and reduce metals in anaerobic conditions. Under anaerobic conditions, Shewanella putrefaciens use aqueous uranium as the electron acceptor in lieu of oxygen. The reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) removes uranium from solution and forms an insoluble compound known as uraninite. Ultraviolet/Visible Spectroscopy was used to analyze uranium ion complexion with several <b>oxazine</b> <b>dyes</b> that included Brilliant Cresyl Blue, Celestine Blue, and Gallomine Triethoiodide. Complexion and resultant color changes with U(VI) and U(IV) with the dye solutions were tested at a variety of pH levels.

These studies showed the best visual indicator to be Celestine Blue...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} and energetic properties of four common <b>oxazine</b> <b>dyes,</b> Nile red, Nile blue A, Cresyl violet, and Brilliant cresyl blue, have been probed {{using a combination}} of infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. IRMPD spectra of the protonated dyes, as generated from an electrospray ionization (ESI) source, were collected in the range of 900 - 1800 cm(- 1). Vibrational band assignments related to carbonyl and substituted-amine stretches were established from a comparison of the experimental spectra of these related systems as well as from a comparison with spectra generated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For Nile red, the thermochemical landscape for protonation at different basic sites was probed using DFT; comparison of IRMPD and calculated IR spectra reveals the site of protonation to be at the carbonyl oxygen. The structural information obtained here in the gas phase pertaining to these important fluorophores is anticipated to provide further insight into their associated intrinsic fluorescent properties in solution...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of {{presented}} thesis is {{to study the}} influence of organic dyes structure on its degradation in diaphragm discharge in liquids. Diaphragm discharge {{is a kind of}} non-thermal plasma that can be generated in liquids by the application of high voltage. In plasma channels (so-called streamers), many physical and chemical processes are formed. High electrical field, shock waves and last but not least emission of electromagnetic waves in the range of visible and ultra-violet radiation appear among physical processes. The most important chemical process is generation of active species. These species initiate chemical reactions and could attack molecules of organic compounds contained in water solution. The reason why organic dyes were chosen in this study is its visible destruction, because it is related to its decolouration. Further, UV-VIS spectroscopy for the determination of concentration during the experiment can be used. Organic dyes are good models of organic substance often contained in waste water and for which removal classical biological, chemical and physical methods aren’t sufficient. Selected dyes were mostly from the group of azo-dyes: Acid Red 14, Acid Red 18, Acid Yellow 23, Direct Blue 53, Direct Red 79, Direct Red 80, Direct Yellow 29, Food Yellow 3 and further, Acid Blue 74 (indigotic dye) and Direct Blue 106 (<b>oxazine</b> <b>dye).</b> Experiments were carried out in a special batch discharge reactor with the anode and the cathode spaces divided by a non-conductive barrier, where the diaphragm with a pin-hole was placed. Measurement showed different removal in the anode and cathode space. We have supposed it was caused by different streamers features and energetic conditions. Dyes were decomposed with higher efficiency in the anode space where the final concentration reached 40 % of the initial concentration while it remained about 90 % in the cathode space. In this thesis the influence of dyes structure on the dye decomposition by electrical discharge was investigated. Dyes consisted of small molecules and dyes with many substitutes bounded on aromatic ring were decomposed more easily than dyes consisted of big molecules. The shift of characteristic wavelength on both directions (to shorter as well as longer wavelength) was observed during the experiments especially when the Direct dyes were decomposed. This phenomenon was probably due to the formation of intermediate product, which have different characteristic wavelength than the primary compound. In general, colourfulness is given by long conjugated systems of double bonds with substitutes bounded on an aromatic ring. Each change in the molecule structure provides the colour change and this could be the possible reason of the shift of characteristic wavelength. The other task was the comparison of degradation process efficiency by the mean of electrolysis and diaphragm discharge. Results showed that electrolysis (30 W) was more convenient for degradation of dyes consisted of small molecules while diaphragm discharge (130170 W) suited for complex molecules. For degradation of small molecules, oxidation on the anode assumed to be the most effective process that is initiated by electrolysis. For degradation of big molecules, attack of active species produced by the discharge is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Far-red {{emitting}} fluorescent dyes for optical microscopy, {{stimulated emission}} depletion (STED), and ground-state depletion (GSDIM) super-resolution microscopy are presented. Fluorinated silicon–rhodamines (SiRF <b>dyes)</b> and phosphorylated <b>oxazines</b> have absorption and emission maxima at about λ≈ 660 and 680  nm, respectively, possess high photostability, and large fluorescence quantum yields in water. A high-yielding synthetic path to introduce three aromatic fluorine atoms and unconventional conjugation/solubilization spacers into the scaffold of a silicon–rhodamine is described. The bathochromic shift in SiRF dyes is achieved without additional fused rings or double bonds. As a result, the molecular size and molecular mass stay quite small (< 600  Da). The {{use of the}} λ= 800  nm STED beam instead of the commonly used one at λ= 750 – 775  nm provides excellent imaging performance and suppresses re-excitation of SiRF and the <b>oxazine</b> <b>dyes.</b> The photophysical properties and immunofluorescence imaging performance of these new far-red emitting dyes (photobleaching, optical resolution, and switch-off behavior) are discussed in detail and {{compared with those of}} some well-established fluorophores with similar spectral properties...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescent {{molecular}} switches have widespread {{potential for}} use as sensors, material applications in electro-optical data storages and displays, and superresolution fluorescence microscopy. We demonstrate that adjustment of fluorophore properties and environmental conditions allows the use of ordinary fluorescent dyes as efficient single-molecule switches that report sensitively on their local redox condition. Adding or removing reductant or oxidant, switches the fluorescence of <b>oxazine</b> <b>dyes</b> between stable fluorescent and non-fluorescent states. At low oxygen concentrations, the off-state that we ascribe to a radical anion is thermally stable with a lifetime in the minutes range. The molecular switches show a remarkable reliability with intriguing fatigue resistance at the single-molecule level: Depending on the switching rate, between 400 and 3, 000 switching cycles are observed before irreversible photodestruction occurs. A detailed picture of the underlying photoinduced and redox reactions is elaborated. In the presence of both reductant and oxidant, continuous switching is manifested by ‘‘blinking’’ with independently controllable on- and off-state lifetimes in both deoxygenated and oxygenated environments. This ‘‘continuous switching mode’’ is advantageously used for imaging actin filament and actin filament bundles in fixed cells with subdiffraction-limited resolution. ...|$|R

40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} studies {{were performed to}} investigate the behavior of uranium with bacteria in an anaerobic environment. Laboratory studies used Shewanella putrefaciens because {{of its ability to}} grow rapidly in aerobic conditions and reduce metals in anaerobic conditions. Under anaerobic conditions, Shewanella putrefaciens use aqueous uranium as the electron acceptor in lieu of oxygen. The reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) removes uranium from solution and forms an insoluble compound known as uraninite. Ultraviolet/Visible Spectroscopy was used to analyze uranium ion complexion with several <b>oxazine</b> <b>dyes</b> that included Brilliant Cresyl Blue, Celestine Blue, and Gallomine Triethoiodide. Complexion and resultant color changes with U(VI) and U(IV) with the dye solutions were tested at a variety of pH levels. The dye behavior was evaluated for future use as a visible reduction indicator for microbial reduction when performing direct plating experiments. These studies showed the best visual indicator to be Celestine Blue. Significant absorbance changes in the 400 to 800 nm wavelength range for Brilliant Cresyl Blue and Gallomine Triethoiodide solutions were not detected. X Ray Diffraction and Electron Microprobe Spectroscopy characterized the solid precipitates by the bacteria. The dark black precipitate exhibited visible characteristics of both UO 2 (s) and U 3 O 8 (s). Electron microprobe showed a very small crystal formed by the bacteria, but was inconclusive with respect to the elemental composition of the mineral. The XRD spectra determined that precipitate was uranium dioxide U 02 (s). The investigation included a time phased uranium isotope analysis in the precipitate and supernatant samples. Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (TIMS) measured the uranium isotopic ratio of 238 U / 235 U to determine if microbial reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) affected these ratios. The isotopic ratios of both the supernatant and precipitate were measured at times ranging from zero to 95 hours. An enriched uranium solution was created by dissolving an enriched sample of U 308 (s) in nitric acid. The U 308 (s) was standard reference material (SRM) from the New Brunswick National Laboratory, and was enriched to roughly 50 percent 235 U. The results of the TIMS experiment showed that there was not a detectable level of fractionation. by Matthew R. Lewis. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Anodic {{oxidation}} of {{a commercial}} dye, methylene blue (MB), from aqueous solutions using an electrochemical cell is reported. Data are provided {{on the effects of}} eight different types of supporting electrolytes, concentration of electrolytes, initial dye concentration, current and electrolytic time on the percentage removal of methylene blue. Anodic oxidation was found to be effective in achieving the removal of methylene blue from aqueous solutions. The optimised electrolytic conditions, for the removal of methylene blue (MB), were applied to the removal of azure A (AA), azure B (AB), azure C (AC), toluidine blue 0 (TBO), new methylene blue (NMB), dimethyl methylene blue (DMMB), thionine (TH), methylene green (MG), methyl violet (MV), Nile blue (NB), neutral red (NR), acridine orange (AO) and resorufin (RS) from aqueous solutions containing sodium chloride. Results indicated that between 84 to 100 % of each dye of phenothiazine was removed during 60 minutes of electrolysis. The percentage removals for the phenothiazine dyes followed the following decreasing order: (MG ≈ MV) > (DMMB ≈ AA) > (AB ≈ AC ≈ NMB) > TBO > TH. However, the azine, acridine and <b>oxazine</b> <b>dyes</b> showed between 98 to 99 % colour removal and the following decreasing order: NB ≈ NR > AO ≈ RS. Strongly electron withdrawing substituents such as nitro group or carbonyl group increases the degradation of the phenothiazine chromophore, whereas the electron donating groups such as amino and alkyl amino groups decrease the degradation. Anodic oxidation studies were extended to the destruction of eight permitted food colours, with azo and triarylmethane chromophore, from aqueous solution containing either sodium chloride or sodium sulphate as a supporting electrolyte. Again, sodium chloride was found to be the best supporting electrolyte and between 97 to 100 % colour removal was achieved after 60 minutes of electrolysis. The percentage removal for the single azo based colourants followed the following increasing order: carmoisine > sunset yellow FCF > amaranth > ponceau 411 > tartrazine. However, the binary and ternary mixtures of food colour showed the following increasing order: blue > green > yellow food colours. The extractions and applications of 54 different types of natural dyes (53 from plants and one from animal origin) are evaluated using simple techniques. The extracted natural dyes were applied in dyeing three types of textile fabrics viz: a) paj silk, b) brushed cotton twill and c) crystallized shimmering satin. The effects of two eco-friendly mordants (alum and iron) on the dyeing process were compared with the dyeing process without mordants. The colour fastness to wash and light (both natural and artificial sun light) of these natural dyes were also assessed. The results showed that out of the 54 dyestuffs studied, 32 plants are potentially able to produce marketable natural dyes. These dyes produced good colour and met minimal performance standards for colour fastness to light and washing. The addition of mordants generally increased the fastness properties. Silk gave the best performance of dyeing uptake and stability. Cotton gave the poorest fastness properties. The overall results showed that, considering molecular associations, the fastness properties were of the order: anthraquinones and tannins> indigoid > flavones> flavonols > flavanols> carotenoids> anthocyanins. Anodic oxidation studies were extended to the destruction of ten natural dyes from aqueous solutions containing either sodium chloride or sodium sulphate as a supporting electrolyte. Anodic oxidation was effective in achieving the removal of green tea (35 %), spinach (69 %), Langdale yellow and turmeric (95 %), carmine, saffron, henna (97 %), beetroot, karkade and sumac (98 %).

Observation under ultraviolet, blue or green exciting light revealed selective fluorescence of lipid droplets, particularly after treatment with aqueous solutions of Nile blue and brilliant cresyl blue oxazones, toluidine blue thiazone, or propylene glycol solutions of canthaxanthin, ethyl-BAO, and ZnTPyP.

40|$|Fluorescent {{techniques}} are essential tools in various fields of modern science, including molecular biology, biophysics, clinical diagnosis, environmental and analytical chemistry. Although {{the number of}} established fluorescence probes is now high, relatively few are long-wavelength light emitting (600 – 1000 nm), which is an important requirement {{for many of these}} bio-applications. This is largely owing {{to the fact that there}} is minimum interference from absorption scattering and a natural auto-fluorescence of biological molecules in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. 1 Thus, one of the most demanding challenges in this area is undoubtedly that of the design and synthesis of new fluorophores or derivatives of known fluorophores with improved water solubility, where the excitation and emission maxima lie beyond approximately 600 nm and the fluorescence quantum yields are high. In addition, these compounds must also include a functional group which is capable of efficient covalent bonding to biomolecules. Of the longer wavelength emitting <b>dyes,</b> <b>oxazine</b> derivatives such as benzo[a]phenoxazines have seen a remarkable growth in research interest and technical importance, being used in the labeling of nucleic acids, amino acids and proteins. 2 - 5 Despite the interest of these polycyclic cationic systems as labels in biological applications, only a shorter number possesses the ability to form covalent bonds with the sample to be studied. Furthermore, since the variety of existing benzophenoxazines is reduced, the development of new suitable derivatives is of great interest.

40|$|Time {{resolved}} fluorescence polarisation {{studies of}} probe motion in a liquid crystal and protein matrix are presented. In this work, the dynamics and orientational properties of four common laser <b>dyes</b> (<b>Oxazine</b> 1, Oxazine 4, Rhodamine 6 G and Rhodamine B) are determined in the liquid crystal 5 CB. These studies provide the first direct measurement of #theta# and #phi# diffusion (hitherto unobserved) of molecular probes in a nematic host. A distinct anisotropy in #theta# and #phi# motion is observed, #theta# diffusion dynamics show a conventional Arrhenius temperature dependence {{in the approach}} to T_N_I. In contrast, #phi# motion is largely temperature independent and shows some evidence of slowing {{in the vicinity of}} the phase transition. From constructing the orientational distribution function P(#theta#), it is revealed that the dyes are aligned in pockets between the flexible tails of the host (#theta##approx# 38 " 0) and conventional models assuming a cylindrical potential are shown to be non-applicable. These effects are most pronounced in Oxazine 4 whose alignment correlates strongly with that of the alkyl tails in 5 CB. Here #theta# and #phi# diffusion dynamics are highly anisotropic with the ratio of #tau#_ 2 _ 0 /#tau#_ 2 _ 2 in the region of 5 : 1. In the approach to T_N_I #tau#_ 2 _ 2 is seen to increase by c. a. 50 % whilst #tau#_ 2 _ 0 shows a c. a. 70 % decrease. Measurements of Oxazine 4 motion in the Isotropic phase of 5 CB indicate that the dye remains strongly correlated with the liquid crystal. Two diffusion times are observed consistent with restricted rotational diffusion within a more slowly diffusing arrangement (domain) of solvent molecules. The domain motion is seen to exhibit a Landau-de Gennes type temperature dependence whilst probe motion within the domains is seen to be largely temperature independent, similar behaviour having been recently reported for diffusion in pure 5 CB. A central portion of the work concerns the development of a wholly new approach to polarised photoselection. A novel 3 beam photoselection technique in which various degrees of excited state alignment can be produced whilst retaining cylindrical symmetry is developed. This technique is applied to both isotropic and nematically aligned dye probes, allowing a clearer picture of probe diffusion to be obtained. Finally, measurements on the fluorescence anisotropy from tryptophan residues embedded in Human Serum Albumin (a principle circulatory protein in humans) are presented. The tryptophan fluorescence anisotropy is sensitive to the overall diffusion of HSA and the local motion of tryptophan within the protein. The binding of Oleic acid is seen to cause a conformational change in the protein whose overall rotation time slows from 22 ns to 34 ns. This is accompanied by a transition to a more compact environment for the tryptophan within HAS, indicated by a narrowing of the width of the local orientational distribution from 21 " 0 to 16 " 0.
