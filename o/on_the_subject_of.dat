5|$|Domitian was {{allegedly}} extremely sensitive regarding his baldness, which he disguised {{in later life}} by wearing wigs. According to Suetonius, he even wrote a book <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> hair care. With regard to Domitian's personality, however, the account of Suetonius alternates sharply between portraying Domitian as the emperor-tyrant, a man both physically and intellectually lazy, and the intelligent, refined personality drawn elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Women's groups led by Lucretia Mott and Paulina Wright Davis held public {{meetings}} in Philadelphia beginning in 1846.

In October 1847, Lucy Stone gave her first public speech <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> women's rights, entitled The Province of Women, at her brother Bowman Stone's church in Gardner, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|A sickly child, Gordon Childe {{was educated}} {{at home for}} a number of years, before gaining a private school {{education}} in North Sydney. In 1907, he began attending Sydney Church of England Grammar School, gaining his Junior Matriculation in 1909 and Senior Matriculation in 1910. At school he studied ancient history, French, Greek, Latin, geometry, algebra and trigonometry, achieving good marks in all subjects, but was bullied because of his strange appearance and unathletic physique. In July 1910 his mother died; his father soon took Monica Gardiner as his third wife. Childe's relationship with his father was strained, particularly following his mother's death, and they disagreed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> religion and politics, with the Reverend being a devout Christian and conservative while his son was an atheist and socialist.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the works}} created {{during the war}} was Yakov Knyazhnin's tragedy Olga (1772). The Russian playwright chose to {{introduce}} Sviatoslav as his protagonist, although his active participation in the events following Igor's death is {{out of sync with}} the traditional chronology. Knyazhnin's rival Nikolai Nikolev (1758–1815) also wrote a play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> Sviatoslav's life. Ivan Akimov's painting Sviatoslav's Return from the Danube to Kiev (1773) explores the conflict between military honour and family attachment. It is a vivid example of Poussinesque rendering of early medieval subject matter.|$|E

5|$|As a preacher, he {{was rather}} eccentric. He {{was not very}} fluent and gifted as a speaker, but had the power of {{engaging}} the attention of his hearers, and was very successful and useful in a revival of religion. He entertained rather singular views <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> the orders in the ministry, objecting {{to the order of}} deacons, and holding that the eldership is the only true order. In consequence of these peculiar views, he would never consent to be ordained a deacon, and therefore never entered into orders at all.|$|E
5|$|As an {{official}} {{history of the}} Japanese Navy, Sakamoto's work {{was considered to be}} official admission of the attacking submarine's identity. Subsequently, most sources assumed as fact Nakagawa's and I-177s role in the loss of Centaur. Nakagawa refused to speak <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> the attack on Centaur following the war crimes investigation at the end of World War II, even to defend himself or deny the claims made by Rohwer's and Sakamoto's works, and died in 1991.|$|E
5|$|At the university, Holmboe again met Christopher Hansteen, who {{had become}} a {{professor}} there in 1816. In 1835, Hansteen published his own mathematics textbook for secondary schools. A reaction to Holmboe's books and method of teaching, it was more practically oriented. Holmboe wrote {{a review of the}} book for the newspaper Morgenbladet, in which he advised schools not to use it. A public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians. It has been claimed that this was the first debate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> school textbooks in Norway. Hansteen's textbook was not reprinted.|$|E

5|$|Beverly Chappell founded The Dougy Center in 1982 {{in tribute}} to Dougy Turno, who died of a brain tumor at age thirteen. In August 1981, Dougy {{wrote a letter to}} {{psychiatrist}} and author Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, a pioneer in near-death studies, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> his own death. This prompted Kübler-Ross to connect Chappell with Dougy and his family, and Chappell to create support groups for grieving children. Despite Kübler-Ross' early influence on the organization, The Dougy Center does not subscribe to the Kübler-Ross model (a series of five emotional stages experienced by survivors of an intimate's death: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) and has even expressed skepticism about the model.|$|E
5|$|Born in London {{and raised}} largely in Brighton, Grinsell {{developed}} an early interest in archaeology through visits to Brighton Museum. Later {{working as a}} bank clerk in London, he embarked on archaeological research in an amateur capacity, visiting prehistoric barrows during his weekends and holidays in order to record their shape, dimensions, and location. On {{the basis of his}} research, he published a range of academic articles and books <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> barrows during the 1930s, gaining recognition as Britain's foremost expert on the subject.

5|$|Caion had an {{enduring}} interest in history and, in 1900, completed his monograph on Wallachian Prince Gheorghe Bibescu.

Bibesco, the Prince's destitute son, continued to employ Caion as his defender and co-author: in 1901, they published an ampler work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> Bibescu family grievances against the modern Romanian establishment. In tandem, Caion publicized his comparison of historical and psychological determinism, with a topical booklet.
