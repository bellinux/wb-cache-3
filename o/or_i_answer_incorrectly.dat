60|$|Then {{he asked}} me if I had seen its Chief, a certain Umslopogaas <b>or</b> Bulalio. <b>I</b> <b>answered,</b> Yes, that <b>I</b> had met him there {{for the first time and}} thought him a very {{remarkable}} man.|$|R

6000|$|... 'He may, for aught I know; but I don't think it's likely. He {{has only}} been here two <b>or</b> three days,' <b>I</b> <b>answered.</b> 'What's your notion?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Three hours <b>or</b> thereabouts," [...] <b>I</b> <b>answered,</b> [...] "but perhaps sooner. I'll {{take two}} prints off {{when it is}} ready. I wonder what the Carrolls will say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Steady, marm, steady," [...] said George. [...] "Save it up now, do, {{and as for}} you, don't you irritate her none of yer, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> won't <b>answer</b> for the consequences, for she's {{an injured}} woman she is, and injured women is apt to be dangerous." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{shook my}} head. [...] "Nor {{on any other}} {{creature}} of land <b>or</b> sea," [...] <b>I</b> <b>answered</b> candidly. The thickness of it, {{and the length of}} the hair, puzzled me.|$|R

60|$|Our cavalcade had halted while I read, {{the ladies}} letting down the glasses and leaning {{out in their}} concern lest some trouble had befallen me <b>or</b> my grandfather. <b>I</b> <b>answered</b> them and bade them ride on, vowing that I would {{overtake}} the coaches before they reached the Patuxent. Then I turned Cynthia's head for town, with Hugo at my heels.|$|R
6000|$|... "God <b>or</b> man," [...] <b>I</b> <b>answered,</b> [...] "I must rest. Let {{the women}} tend to lady Quilla, and give me food and drink, after which I will sleep. At sunset we march home to Huaracha, your king and mine, to give him back his daughter. Till then there is naught to fear, since Kari has no troops at hand with which to attack us. Still, set outposts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Believe <b>or</b> not," [...] <b>I</b> <b>answered.</b> [...] "But believe this--that one day {{you shall}} stand {{face to face with}} a Judge Whom there is no deceiving, to answer for the abomination that you make of justice in His Holy Name.

6000|$|But {{what are}} we to {{understand}} in gospel days, by going out of the house of the Lord, for <b>or</b> by sin? <b>I</b> <b>answer,</b> if it be done voluntarily, then sin leads you out: if it be done by the holy compulsion of the church, then it is done by the judicial judgment of God; that is, they are cut off, and cast out from thence, as a just reward for their transgressions (Lev 20, 21:3; Eze 14:8; 1 Cor 5:13).[27] ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} are already {{beginning}} to treat me as a master," [...] she cried, tapping him with her fan upon the arm. [...] "Patience, patience! that should come in time. A woman loves to be obeyed at first, although afterwards she finds her pleasure in obeying. Do as I ask you, for Heaven's sake, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> will <b>answer</b> for nothing. Indeed, now I think of it," [...] she added, with a manner of one who has just seen further into a difficulty, [...] "I find a better plan of keeping importunate visitors away. Tell the porter to admit no one for you, except a person who may come that night to claim a debt; and speak with some feeling, as though you feared the interview, so that he may take your words in earnest." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "How can <b>I</b> <b>answer</b> such a question, Mr. Finn? <b>Or,</b> rather, <b>I</b> will, <b>answer</b> it fully. It {{is not a}} {{week since}} we told each other, you to me and I to you, that we were both poor,--both without other means than those which come to us from our fathers. You will make your way;--will make it surely; but how at present could you marry any woman unless she had money of her own? For me,--like so many other girls, it was {{necessary}} that I should stay at home or marry some one rich enough to dispense with fortune in a wife. The man whom {{in all the world}} I think the best has asked me to share everything with him;--and I have thought it wise to accept his offer." ...|$|R

For saith he, when he is come, he shall glorify me, for he shall take of mine, and shew it unto you (John 16:14).|$|R

50|$|Sagot ng Dalawa (Answer of Two): Also {{known as}} Ask the Mob, One mob member who {{answered}} correctly {{and one who}} <b>answered</b> <b>incorrectly</b> are chosen at random. Each explains his/her decision to the contestant. Mob members must tell the truth as to which answer they chose, but {{do not have to}} tell the truth as to why they chose that answer. This automatically eliminates one wrong answer, thus leaving contestants with a 50-50 chance of picking the right answer. If all mob members <b>answer</b> <b>incorrectly,</b> the solo player will be permitted to talk to one mob member and then will be informed that their answer is incorrect. If all mob members answer correctly, the solo player isn’t told that and is given the option to lock the answer in. This can also occur if all the mob members <b>answer</b> <b>incorrectly,</b> but choose the same incorrect answer. This is represented by a question mark.|$|R
