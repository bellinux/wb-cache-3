As Commander of amphibious forces, Atlantic Fleet, he was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> of the vessels sent to the Caribbean by President Kennedy to stop the Cold War from escalating into World War III.|$|E
5|$|After these exploits, he {{was badly}} wounded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> on the Gallipoli Peninsula, but {{recovered}} and served continuously {{for the remainder}} of the war and into the Russian Civil War. In 1939 aged 57, he again volunteered for military service and spent three more years at sea, commanding convoys during the Battle of the Atlantic. During his lengthy career, Robinson remained a highly regarded officer who had served through four wars.|$|E

From 12 December the regiment was working to extend a sangar and enjoyed fresh meat, bread, vegetables, and rum. On 17 December bivouac sheets and blankets arrived. The weather continued cold and showery, but the good rations and extra blankets and bivouac shelters lifted morale.|$|E

5|$|Birdsong is a 1993 war {{novel and}} family saga by the English author Sebastian Faulks. It is Faulks' fourth novel. The plot follows two main {{characters}} living at different times: {{the first is}} Stephen Wraysford, a British soldier <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> in Amiens during the First World War, {{and the second is}} his granddaughter, Elizabeth Benson, whose 1970s plotline follows her attempts to recover an understanding of Stephen's experience of the war.|$|E
5|$|Hardy often {{acted as}} a scout who would help bring {{supplies}} to troops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line.</b> On September 25, 1918, he {{was present at the}} Meuse River during a mustard gas attack and, {{at some point during the}} war, he received an injury to his knee. Hardy rarely spoke about the fighting itself, and preferred to talk about France's weather when asked about his experiences overseas.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts and New Hampshire were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> of the war, yet the New England colonies {{suffered}} less economic {{damage than}} other areas.

5|$|Stephen {{returns to}} England briefly, and finds relief at {{being able to}} enjoy the Norfolk {{countryside}} away from the trenches. When he meets Jeanne again on the way back, he tells her how he dreads returning to the front line after leave.

5|$|A brief {{shelling}} of {{the hill}} begins {{the next day at}} dawn. C Company attempts to capture the hill but is repelled by gunfire. Among the first killed is one of the platoon leaders, Second Lieutenant Whyte. During the battle, a squad led by Sergeant Keck hides behind a swell safe from enemy fire to wait for reinforcements. Keck reaches for a grenade but accidentally pulls the pin and dies in the process. Lieutenant Colonel Tall orders the company commander, Captain James Staros, to take the bunker by frontal assault, at whatever cost. Staros refuses and Tall decides to join Staros <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> to see the situation. The Japanese resistance seems to have lessened, and Tall's opinion of Staros seems to have been sealed. Private Witt, having been assigned punitively as a stretcher bearer, asks to rejoin the company, and is allowed to do so.|$|E
5|$|Hart {{was made}} {{commander}} of the 2nd Infantry Brigade when the 4th Brigade was disbanded in February 1918. He was mentioned in despatches for his work with the 4th Infantry Brigade while it was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line.</b> His new brigade absorbed many of the soldiers of his previous command. However, on 18 February, {{just two weeks after}} taking command, he was badly gassed during an artillery barrage on his headquarters. The barrage, using a mixture of high explosive and mustard gas shells, also incapacitated most of his staff. Temporarily blinded, he was evacuated to a hospital in the rear and then to Ã‰taples. After recovering his sight, which took about a week, he was dispatched to the south of France to convalesce.|$|E

5|$|In mid-September he was {{formally}} appointed as unit adjutant, swiftly {{followed by a}} temporary promotion to captain. He formally {{changed his name to}} Wilder-Neligan in October, and remained at Anzac until November, after which the battalion was evacuated to Egypt. During its time in Egypt, the 9th Battalion was stationed for a period <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> in the desert near the Suez Canal. On one occasion, an Ottoman patrol was seen, and the adventurous Wilder-Neligan asked to be allowed to take out a patrol on camels to cut them off. With certain restrictions, this was permitted, but no contact with the enemy occurred. In March 1916, he relinquished his post of adjutant, and was substantively promoted to captain before the battalion left Alexandria for France and the Western Front {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|Negus {{served in}} the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) with the British Expeditionary Force for the first 18 months of the war. He {{initially}} deployed with the 1st General Hospital, then saw action in the trenches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> with a machine-gun battalion at the First Battle of Ypres. The effects of explosives during this period left him with tinnitus. This {{was followed by a}} period serving on hospital barges. In 1916, Negus, still with the RAMC, was posted to the 3rd (Lahore) Division (part of the British Indian Army) and took part in the Mesopotamia Campaign. As one of those who had deployed to the Western Front in the opening months of the war, he was later awarded the Mons Star. His service in the RAMC ended in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Player {{characters}} and monsters have hit points (HP), with the characters' HP captioned below the main battle screen. Attacks reduce remaining HP until none are left, {{at which point}} the character faints or the monster dies. If all characters are defeated, the game must be restored from a saved game file. The player can restore the characters' hit points by having them sleep in an inn or use items in the party's inventory, such as potions, as well as using healing magic spells. Equipment (such as swords and armor) bought in towns or found in dungeons can be used to increase damage inflicted on monsters or minimize damage received. The player can choose whether characters appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> of a battle or in the back. A character's placement impacts damage received and inflicted {{depending on the type of}} attack.|$|E

5|$|The {{progress}} of the war from September 1939 to the summer of 1941, with a few exceptions, seemed to validate the Luftwaffes pre-war focus on the offensive use of its fighter arm. The success of the Luftwaffe in the Norwegian Campaign and the battles of the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, and Greece had vindicated this method. The Luftwaffe had defended German airspace by driving away enemy air power from Germany's borders and defeating their enemies in their own skies. The occupation of its opponent's territory denied Germany's enemies the bases to effectively strike at German targets by air. German daylight defences were rarely tested during this time. This run of events, and {{the knowledge that the}} RAF was only capable of short penetrations over France in daylight, led the Luftwaffe to believe Germany was invulnerable to attack. To maintain the offensive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line,</b> bomber production dominated the air industry while the production of fighters was given less priority.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} {{was first}} governed by William Henry Harrison {{who oversaw the}} negotiation with the native inhabitants to open {{large parts of the}} territory to settlement. In 1810 a popularly elected government was established as the territory continued to grow in population and develop a very basic road network, government, and education system. At the outbreak of Tecumseh's War, the territory was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> of battle and Harrison led a military force in the opening hostilities at the Battle of Tippecanoe, and then in the subsequent invasion of Canada during the War of 1812. Thomas Posey was appointed to the vacant governorship, but the opposition party, led by Congressman Jonathan Jennings, had dominance in the territorial affairs for its remaining years and began pressing for statehood. In June 1816, a constitutional convention was held and a state government was formed. The territory was dissolved on December 11, 1816, by an act of Congress granting statehood to Indiana.|$|E
5|$|When the Chetnik leaders {{appointed}} by DraÅ¾a MihailoviÄ‡, Majors BoÅ¡ko TodoroviÄ‡ and DangiÄ‡, {{became aware of}} the commencement of Operation Southeast Croatia, they advised other Chetnik commanders that the operation was targeted at the Partisans, and {{there was no need for}} the Chetniks to get involved. Following this, their units withdrew from their positions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line,</b> let the Germans pass through their areas, or went home. Many withdrew across the Drina into German-occupied Serbia to avoid being engaged, which severely weakened the Partisan defences with the result that they suffered significant casualties and lost a great deal of territory. These actions severed any remaining cooperative links that remained between the Chetniks and Partisans in eastern Bosnia.|$|E

5|$|Within 24 hours, British commanders {{were able}} to {{concentrate}} a force of 50,000 men in the Romani area, a three to one advantage. This force included the two infantry divisions â€“ the 52nd and the newly arrived 42nd â€“ four mounted brigades, two {{of which had been}} on active duty since 20 July, and two heavily engaged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> the day before, and may have included the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, although it was still at Hill 70, and the Mobile Column at Hod el Bada. At this time, command of the 5th Mounted Brigade passed from the Anzac Mounted Division to the infantry division; the 42nd Division, it being suggested that orders required the Anzac Mounted Division to remain in position, and that the 3rd Light Horse Brigade alone was to make a flank attack.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian troops {{raised their}} {{national}} flag {{on the eastern}} bank of the canal at 14:35. By that time company and battalion-size units of Israeli tanks and infantry began reaching the Bar Lev Line, but were prevented from reaching their positions by Egyptian ambushes. Those tanks that broke through came under fire {{from the west bank}} ramparts. At 14:45, a second wave of infantry landed on the opposite bank. Subsequent waves of infantry arrived at fifteen-minute intervals. However, after the fourth wave, fatigue and technical problems with the boats gradually widened the time intervals. The Egyptians abandoned their schedules, giving priority to anti-tank teams and weaponry that could critically affect the battle. Amphibious vehicles were also used to cross equipment. The wooden carts were ferried to the east bank via boats, where they were initially lifted {{to the top of the}} sand wall with their loads. However, this method proved clumsy, and the carts were first emptied then lifted, after which they were re-loaded and dragged to troops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line.</b> The carts greatly facilitated the supply and transportation of matÃ©riel on the east bank.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{decided that}} the summer 1942 {{campaign}} would be concentrated in the south; efforts would be made to capture the oilfields in the Caucasus. The Battle of Stalingrad, a major turning point of the war, began on 23 August 1942 with a bombing campaign by the Luftwaffe. The Sixth Army entered the city, but because of its location <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line,</b> it was still possible for the Soviets to encircle and trap it there without reinforcements or supplies. When the Sixth Army was surrounded {{by the end of}} November in Operation Uranus, GÃ¶ring promised that the Luftwaffe would be able to deliver a minimum of 300 tons of supplies to the trapped men every day. On the basis of these assurances, Hitler demanded that there be no retreat; they were to fight to the last man. Though some airlifts were able to get through, the amount of supplies delivered never exceeded 120 tons per day. The remnants of the German Sixth Armyâ€”some 91,000 men out of an army of 285,000â€”surrendered in early February 1943; only 5,000 of these captives survived the Russian prisoner of war camps to see Germany again.|$|E
