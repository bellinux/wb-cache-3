5|$|Director Doug Liman {{has said}} that he had been a fan of the source novel by Robert Ludlum since he read it in high school. Near the end of {{production}} of Liman's previous film Swingers, Liman decided to develop a film adaptation of the novel. After more than two years of securing rights to the book from Warner Bros. and a further year of screenplay development with screenwriter Tony Gilroy, the film went through two years of production. Universal Pictures acquired the film rights to Ludlum's books in the hopes <b>of</b> <b>starting</b> <b>a</b> new film franchise. William Blake Herron was brought in to rewrite the script in 1999.|$|E
5|$|This service {{continued}} until early 1809, {{when she returned}} to Britain. By now Britain was heavily involved in the Baltic, protecting mercantile interests. An expedition under Sir James Gambier in July 1807 had captured most of the Danish Navy at the Second Battle of Copenhagen, in response to fears that it might fall into Napoleon's hands, at the cost <b>of</b> <b>starting</b> <b>a</b> war with Denmark. Captain Hamilton left the ship, and was superseded by Captain Edward Sneyd Clay. Temeraire now became the flagship of Rear Admiral Sir Manley Dixon, with orders to go to the Baltic to reinforce the fleet stationed there under Sir James Saumarez. Temeraire arrived in May 1809 and was sent to blockade Karlskrona on the Swedish coast.|$|E

Subramaniam cares for his family a lot and excessively dotes upon his children. Santosh, the younger son, does not like this as he wants to be independent and free from his father’s guidance and control. But Santosh acts normally to avoid hurting his father. Santosh has in mind that both his career and wife should be of his choice only and not of his father. Subramaniam wants Santosh to assist him in managing the company but Santosh dreams <b>of</b> <b>starting</b> <b>a</b> new company on his own and does not prefer to work in his father’s company. Meanwhile, Subramaniam arranges Santosh’s wedding with Rajeshwari, daughter of his friend Ramamoorthy. Santosh is shocked as he has no other option rather than agreeing for this wedding.|$|E

25|$|In 1797, {{ten years}} after coming to Muncy, Benjamin McCarty {{conceived}} the idea <b>of</b> <b>starting</b> <b>a</b> town, and began laying out lots on what is now Main Street, and sold them to different parties.

25|$|Additionally, it {{has been}} {{pointed out that the}} idea that very simple rules often {{generate}} great complexity is already an established idea in science, particularly in chaos theory and complex systems.

A reamer is only intended to enlarge a hole a slight amount which, depending on the reamers size, may be anything from 0.1 millimeter to perhaps a millimeter. A core drill bit may be used to double the size of a hole.|$|E
