40|$|Research Question/Issue: How do {{conflicting}} institutional logics predict {{and explain}} the <b>overstatement</b> <b>of</b> corporate governance compliance in a developing country? Research Findings/Insights: A unique opportunity to study <b>overstatement</b> <b>of</b> compliance is available through checklists published in annual reports by companies in Bangladesh. A data set contrasting with that available from the checklists is collected by a confidential survey <b>of</b> company secretaries. <b>Overstatement</b> <b>of</b> compliance with the country’s Corporate Governance Guideline issued in 2006 is measured by comparing the published compliance with that revealed by the survey. There is significant <b>overstatement</b> <b>of</b> compliance in annual reports, {{particularly with respect to}} the less directly observable provisions of the Guideline. The overstatement is positively associated with control by a sponsor family and is negatively associated with the presence of an institutional investor on the board of directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The logic associated with the regulative framework of an Anglo-American-based corporate governance model conflicts with the logic of a cultural-cognitive institutional framework in a developing country. The resulting contest of legitimacy motivates firms to overstate compliance with the Corporate Governance Guideline 2006 in annual reports. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study highlights the challenges of introducing an Anglo-American model of corporate governance in a developing country. National and international investors should seek to understand the reality of the corporate governance structure of firms in developing countries, rather than relying solely on compliance reported in annual reports. For researchers, there may be limitations in using the compliance reported in annual reports as a measure of corporate governance...|$|R

40|$|This paper’s {{goal is to}} {{identify}} the sources <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> and poverty dynamics among Malawian households between 1998 and 2002 and to model poverty transitions in Malawi using a bivariate probit model with endogenous selection to address the "initial conditions' problem. The exogeneity of the initial state is strongly rejected and could result in considerable <b>overstatement</b> <b>of</b> {{the effects of the}} explanatory factors. The results of the bivariate probit model do indicate that education of the household head, per capita acreage cultivated and changes in household size are significantly related to the probability of being poor in 2002 irrespective of the poverty status in 1998. For those households who were poor in 1998, the probability of being poor in 2002 was significantly influenced by household size, value of livestock owned and mean time to services, while residence in the Northern region was a significant variable in determining the probability of being poor in 2002 for households that were not poor in 1998. ...|$|R

40|$|Spending {{on medical}} {{care is a}} large and growing {{component}} of GDP. There are wellknown measurement problems that are estimated to overstate inflation and understate real growth for this sector {{by as much as}} 1 - 1 / 2 percentage points per year. Because of its size, this would translate into an <b>overstatement</b> <b>of</b> inflation for the overall economy of about ¼ percentage point with an equal understatement in real GDP growth. In this paper, we use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to obtain new, more comprehensive estimates for this bias and to explore a possible adjustment to existing official price indexes. The MEPS data show an upward bias to price growth in this sector of 1 percentage point, which translates into an <b>overstatement</b> <b>of</b> overall inflation of. 2 percentage point and an understatement of GDP growth of the same amount. We also find that an adjustment recently used in Bradley et al provides a useful approximation to the indexes advocated by health economists. ...|$|R

40|$|Because of gaps in {{existing}} surveys and methodological {{problems with the}} computation of productivity measures, outsourcing and offshoring result in an <b>overstatement</b> <b>of</b> labor productivity and multifactor productivity growth in manufacturing. Although {{it is impossible to}} fully characterize the size of the bias, I present several pieces of evidence indicating that it is large. Any <b>overstatement</b> <b>of</b> productivity in manufacturing, which has been a driver of productivity in the American economy, may have important implications for aggregate productivity measurement, particularly {{to the extent that the}} bias arises from offshoring activities. These findings may help explain why recent high growth in labor productivity has not been associated with widespread wage gains but rather with an increase in capital’s share of GDP: labor productivity growth in manufacturing, and most likely in the aggregate economy, are overstated, and the very factors that have led to the overstatement— outsourcing and offshoring—depress wages. The effects of outsourcing and offshoring on manufacturing and aggregate productivity measurement, I argue, warrant further study, and productivity measures should be interpreted with caution...|$|R

40|$|Post-election audits use the {{discrepancy}} between machine counts and a hand tally of votes in {{a random sample of}} precincts to infer whether error affected the electoral outcome. The maximum relative <b>overstatement</b> <b>of</b> pairwise margins (MRO) quantifies that discrepancy. The electoral outcome a full hand tally shows must agree with the apparent outcome if the MRO is less than 1. This condition is sharper than previous ones when there are more than two candidates or when voters may vote for more than one candidate. For the 2006 U. S. Senate race in Minnesota, a test using MRO gives a P-value of 4. 05 % for the hypothesis that a full hand tally would find a different winner, less than half the value Stark [Ann. Appl. Statist. 2 (2008) 550 – 581] finds. 1. Maximum relative <b>overstatement</b> <b>of</b> pairwise margins. For a candidate other than an apparent winner to be a real winner of an election, error that hurts that candidate or helps an apparent winner must exceed that apparent winner’s margin of victory over that candidate. The maximum relative <b>overstatement</b> <b>of</b> pairwise margins (MRO) takes that into account; previous measures compare errors with the margin of victory over the runner-up alone. Consider a contest with K candidates, 1, [...] .,K, and N precincts, 1, [...] .,N. Each voter may vote for up to f candidates. The f candidates who apparently won are those in Kw. Those who apparently lost are in Kℓ. The apparent vote for candidate k in precinct p is vkp. The apparent vote for candidate k is Vk ≡ ∑ N p= 1 vkp.
