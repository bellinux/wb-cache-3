5|$|The Islamic conquests {{reached their}} {{peak in the}} mid-eighth century. The defeat of Muslim forces at the Battle of Tours in 732 led to the reconquest of {{southern}} France by the Franks, but {{the main reason for}} the halt of Islamic growth in Europe was the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate and its replacement by the Abbasid Caliphate. The Abbasids moved their capital to Baghdad and were more concerned with the Middle East than Europe, losing control of sections of the Muslim lands. Umayyad descendants took over the Iberian Peninsula, the Aghlabids controlled North Africa, and the Tulunids became rulers of Egypt. By the middle of the 8th century, new trading patterns were emerging in the Mediterranean; trade between the Franks and the Arabs replaced the old Roman economy. Franks traded timber, furs, swords and slaves in return for silks and <b>other</b> <b>fabrics,</b> spices, and precious metals from the Arabs.|$|E

25|$|The Second Empire saw a {{revolution}} in retail commerce, as the Paris middle class and consumer demand grew rapidly. The revolution was fuelled {{in large part by}} Paris fashions, especially the crinoline, which demanded enormous quantities of silk, satin, velour, cashmere, percale, mohair, ribbons, lace and <b>other</b> <b>fabrics</b> and decorations. Before the Second Empire, clothing and luxury shops were small and catered to a very small clientele; their windows were covered with shutters or curtains. Any who entered had to explain their presence to the clerks, and prices were never posted; customers had to ask for them.|$|E
25|$|Once {{she started}} experimenting with the gum-bichromate process, Hahn started {{stitching}} into her photographs. Printing onto canvas and <b>other</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{allowed her to}} use thread to highlight {{certain aspects of the}} photograph. In combining her photographs with conventional practices, Hahn successfully intertwines formal and conceptual aspects. Not only does she speak to the mundane tasks of everyday life, but also about routine and normativity. In highlighting the ordinary in her work, Hahn elevates and revives that which has been lost in the practice of daily life. Embroidery references femininity, as Hahn underlines the feminist issue of the anonymity of women's handicraft. Her embroidery often emphasized flowers with its three-dimensionality, furthering the idea of femininity; she later on pursued this as a symbol and incorporated it in several of her other series.|$|E

25|$|During regular, day-to-day activities, Somali women usually {{wear the}} guntiino. It {{is a long}} stretch of cloth tied over the {{shoulder}} and draped around the waist. The cloth is usually made out of alandi, which is a textile that is common in the Horn region and some parts of North Africa. The garment can be worn in different styles. It can also be made with <b>other</b> <b>fabrics,</b> including white cloth with gold borders. For more formal settings, such as at weddings or religious celebrations like Eid, women wear the dirac. It is a long, light, diaphanous voile dress made of silk, chiffon, taffeta or saree fabric. The gown is worn over a full-length half-slip and a brassiere. Known as the gorgorad, the underskirt is made out of silk and serves as {{a key part of the}} overall outfit. The dirac is usually sparkly and very colorful, the most popular styles being those with gilded borders or threads.|$|E
25|$|Shoes were {{narrow and}} often emphasized. They had a pointed toe and a medium height heel. Buttons, patent leather, and laced {{models of the}} shoe were also {{manufactured}} and readily available. Similarly, there were shoes for every occasion; oxfords for a tailored costume, slippers with straps for festive occasions or pumps with pearl buckles, and finally, boots which were often edged in fur {{to stave off the}} winter chill when riding in a carriage in the winter. At the beginning of 1900s shoes still maintained the same design of the Victorian era. Shoes were commonly made with seal skin or Moroccan leather. Having boots made of seal skin was most common for people in a higher social class. Seal skin boots were known to be extremely durable and could be worn during every season. Boots made from Moroccan leather were more uncomfortable and stiff. World War I caused this opulent era to tone down due to the increased sanctions on the trade of leather and <b>other</b> <b>fabrics,</b> and shoes were starting to incorporate a fabric topping.|$|E

In 1920 a British Government report estimated that there were 550 cotton looms in the town with an annual output worth 30-40,000,000 Francs. But the industry suffered from imports from Europe and by 1927 only 119 weaving establishments remained.

2500|$|Erwin Mill was {{a textile}} mill in Durham, North Carolina that {{operated}} between {{the years of}} 1893 and 1986. After seeing the success of other cotton mills in the Northeast and locally in Durham, entrepreneur Benjamin N. Duke incorporated the mill in 1892 and recruited William H. Erwin to manage the enterprise. The mill’s success in the late 19th and early 20th centuries {{was the result of}} Erwin’s and his successors’ exceptional management tactics, even when the factory hit obstacles such as the Great Depression and the unionization of its workers. The mill grew quickly in the late 19th century and early 20th century, became one of North Carolina’s largest cotton mills. It originally produced muslin pouches for tobacco, but the mill would later expand its production to <b>other</b> <b>fabrics,</b> becoming one of the largest producers of denim in the world during the early 1900s. [...] Workers at the mill enjoyed some of the best working conditions and highest wages in textile factories throughout the southern United States. Mill employees would later sign union-friendly labor agreements that were radical to the southern textile industry in the early to mid 20th century. The establishment of homes, businesses and recreation areas in the mill village was a significant factor {{in the development of the}} West Durham, especially the Ninth Street business district and the Old West Durham Neighborhood. Erwin Mill No. 1 is on the National Register of Historic Places and the mill village of West Durham is a National Historic District. [...] An apartment complex, office building and shopping center of the same name that are built on the original site also commemorate the factory.|$|E
2500|$|Maimonides {{taught that}} a garment {{to which the}} Torah obligates a person to attach tzitzit must have three characteristics: (1) it must have four or more corners; (2) it must {{be large enough to}} cover both the head and most of the body of a child who is able to walk on his own in the {{marketplace}} without having someone watch him; and (3) it must be made of either wool or linen. For a garment of wool, the white strands should be made of wool. For a garment of linen, the white strands should be made of linen. For garments of <b>other</b> <b>fabrics,</b> the white strands should be made from the same fabric as the garment. [...] which says, [...] "And you shall see them," [...] implies that the obligation to wear tzitzit applies during the day, but not at night. Nevertheless, a blind man is obligated to wear tzitzit, for even though he does not see them, others see him wearing them. One is permitted to wear tzitzit at night, provided he does not recite a blessing. One should recite the blessing over tzitzit in the morning when the sun has risen so that one can tell the strands of techelet from those that are white. The blessing is: [...] "Blessed are you, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to wrap ourselves with tzitzit." [...] One should recite the blessing anytime he wraps himself in tzitzit during the day. Maimonides taught that the Torah does not require women and children to wear tzitzit, but the Rabbis oblige every boy who knows how to dress himself to wear tzitzit so as to teach him to fulfill commandments. Women who wish to wrap themselves in tzitzit may do so without reciting a blessing, and no one should prevent them. Maimonides taught that there is no obligation to attach tzitzit to a garment that remains folded in place, without a person wearing it. The garment does not require tzitzit. Rather, the person wearing the garment has the obligation. Maimonides taught that even though a person is not obligated to buy a tallit and wrap himself in it so that he must attach tzitzit to it, it is not proper for a person to release himself from the commandment. He should always try to be wrapped in a garment that requires tzitzit so as to fulfill the commandment. In particular, Maimonides taught that one should take care to be wrapped in a tallit during prayer, and it is very shameful for a Torah scholar to pray without being wrapped in a tallit. And Maimonides taught that a person should always be careful regarding the commandment of tzitzit, because [...] which says [...] "And you shall see them and remember all the commandments of God," [...] implies that the commandment of tzitzit is considered equal to all the commandments and all the commandments are considered dependent on it.|$|E

60|$|So with <b>other</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{of human}} thought, {{imagination}} has been spinning and weaving them all. From the most concrete of inventions {{to the most}} abstract of conceptions the same force reveals itself upon examination; for there is no gulf between what we call practical and what we consider theoretical.

We are too prone to regard the present age of the world as preeminently practical, much as a middle-aged man laments the witching fancies of his boyhood.
