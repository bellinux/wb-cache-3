40|$|Apologies are {{commonly}} used to deal with transgressions in relationships. Results to date, however, indicate that the positive effects <b>of</b> <b>apologies</b> vary widely, and the match between people's judgments <b>of</b> <b>apologies</b> and the true value <b>of</b> <b>apologies</b> has not been studied. Building on the affective and behavioral forecasting literature, we predicted that people would overestimate how much they value apologies in reality. Across three experimental studies, our results showed that after having been betrayed by another party (or after imagining {{this to be the}} case), people (a) rated the value <b>of</b> an <b>apology</b> much more highly when they imagined receiving an apology than when they actually received an apology and (b) displayed greater trusting behavior when they imagined receiving an apology than when they actually received an apology. These results suggest that people are prone to forecasting errors regarding the effectiveness <b>of</b> an <b>apology</b> and that they tend to overvalue the impact of receiving one...|$|R

40|$|With the {{dissertation}} project two central {{questions regarding}} apologies are addressed. Both questions are analyzed {{from the perspective}} of those that were transgressed or victimized in a conflict. Firstly, the author wanted to find answers to the question which components <b>of</b> <b>apologies</b> contribute to their effectiveness. To address this question the effect <b>of</b> <b>apologies</b> with varying components on the acceptance <b>of</b> the <b>apology</b> and forgiveness was scrutinized in four experimental studies (Manuscript 1 and 2). Furthermore it was scrutinized by means of two of the four experimental studies (Study 1 of Manuscript 1 and 2) if the answers to the question which content <b>of</b> <b>apologies</b> is effective depends on the severity of the transgression for which the apology is given. Secondly, the author wanted to find out why the content <b>of</b> <b>apologies</b> impacts on their effectiveness. Therefore, mediator variables were analyzed in the four experimental studies {{to see if they could}} explain the relationship between the content <b>of</b> <b>apologies</b> and their effectiveness. Two of the four experimental studies evaluated the two central questions of the dissertation project for interpersonal (Manuscript 1) and two for intergroup apologies (Manuscript 2). In a further, non-experimental study (Manuscript 3), an empirical analysis of the violated needs after the experience of interpersonal conflicts was conducted. The aim was to identify further possible mediator variables for the relationship between the content <b>of</b> interpersonal <b>apologies</b> and their effectiveness. Together the five studies of the three manuscripts form the dissertation project. There are five main outcomes of the dissertation project, which extend previous research on apologies. Firstly, addressing the question which content <b>of</b> <b>apologies</b> is effective, it applied to interpersonal and intergroup apologies that their components – operationalized with reference to the models by Blatz et al. (2009) and Kirchhoff et al. (2009) – mattered in terms of the effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>apologies.</b> In the interpersonal context effectiveness meant an increase in forgiveness and in the intergroup context an increase in the acceptance <b>of</b> the <b>apology.</b> Secondly, even though having only received little support, the finding that the components <b>of</b> the <b>apology</b> contributed to their effectiveness seemed to apply slightly more following transgressions of higher severity. Thirdly, the components that had to be included in the apologies in order to observe a significant change in the measurements of effects were context-dependent. This meant that the combination and number of components in the apologies that were more successful than less complete apologies varied across studies. Fourthly, addressing the question why the content <b>of</b> <b>apologies</b> contributes to their effectiveness, no satisfying answers were found. Neither the reduction of anger in both the interpersonal and the intergroup context nor the fulfillment of the need for empowerment in the intergroup context reliably mediated the relationship between the content <b>of</b> <b>apologies</b> and their effectiveness. Fifthly, six needs categories for transgressed people in the interpersonal context were identified. These need categories can be analyzed in further research as mediator variables for the relationship between the utterances <b>of</b> interpersonal <b>apologies</b> and measurements <b>of</b> effects. The author concludes that despite some shortcomings of the studies, it is possible to consider the results within the framework <b>of</b> <b>apologies</b> and conflict transformation in personal one-on-one settings or in the intergroup setting, respectively. Nonetheless, further research is necessary to validate or if necessary question and revise the results of the dissertation project...|$|R

Vaughn eventually pleads guilty at his arraignment and insists on serving life without parole. Marvin and Tweety are sentenced to 30 years in prison, but Ellison tells Howard he feels no comfort because his wife is still dead. Howard tries to give Vaughn's letter to Ellison, but he refuses to accept it. Howard eventually speaks directly to Vaughn in prison, where Vaughn admits he handled the gun during the stick-up because he thought {{if he had the}} gun, he could control the situation and prevent anyone from getting hurt. Vaughn said he lost control of the robbery, and insists he needs to serve the life sentence to make amends. A devastated Howard finally agrees with Felton's opinion that Vaughn was indeed the shooter.|$|E
5|$|Lyon later {{apologized to}} the House as a whole, {{claiming}} he had not known it was in session when he confronted Griswold, and meant no breach of decorum or disrespect to the body; he also provided a written letter <b>of</b> <b>apology.</b> Not satisfied with the apology, on February 15, 1798, Griswold retaliated by attacking Lyon with a wooden cane, beating him about the head and shoulders in view of other representatives on the House floor. Lyon retreated to a fire pit and defended himself with the tongs until other Congressmen broke up the fight, with several pulling Griswold by his legs {{to get him to}} let go of Lyon. Although the committee appointed to investigate recommended censure of both Lyon and Griswold, the House as a whole rejected the motion. The issue was resolved when both Lyon and Griswold promised the House that they would keep the peace and remain on good behavior.|$|E
5|$|The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) {{contemplated}} {{whether it}} would be better to cancel all matches in Guyana or to sack Sobers; neither prospect was attractive. The crisis ended when Eric Williams, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, wrote a letter <b>of</b> <b>apology</b> for Sobers to sign, which was relayed to the WICB and several governmental bodies in late October 1970. This was accepted, and the incident was soon largely forgotten. Sobers regained his overwhelming popularity with West Indian cricket fans, continued as team captain until 1972 and retired from cricket two years later. He thereafter retained his stance that politics should not interfere with sport. His Rhodesian visit has been cited as precursoring the South African rebel tours controversy of the 1980s.|$|E

Tina defends Jenny after the original film reels of Lez Girls are stolen, preventing the film from being released. Jenny later starts a relationship with Shane. Jenny steals Alice Pieszecki's (Leisha Hailey) ideas for a play which sparks a feud between the pair. Alice tries to convince everyone that the ideas were hers. Jenny keeps up the pretense and convinces everyone it is an original idea. Alice tries to break Shane and Jenny up to no avail. Jenny then reveals to Dylan Moreland (Alexandra Hedison) that Helena Peabody (Rachel Shelley) and the rest of their friends are setting her up to find out if she is in love with Helena or her money. Jenny starts teasing Max by buying him feminine gifts for his pregnancy. This alienates Shane and is worsened by her trust issues involving Shane's fidelity. Shane sleeps with Niki once more and their relationship reaches a breaking point. Helena later finds out that Jenny revealed the truth to Dylan. This makes Helena desperate for revenge on her old friend. Tina and Shane later find Molly's letter in the loft. Tina then finds the stolen originals of Lez Girls and she goes to confront Jenny.|$|E
5|$|The umpires {{reported}} Waddington to the cricket {{committee of}} the MCC for inciting the crowd through his appeals and gestures of displeasure when batsmen were not given out. Waddington maintained his innocence but the MCC supported the umpires, finding him guilty of dissent, and the Yorkshire president Lord Hawke persuaded him {{to write a letter}} <b>of</b> <b>apology</b> to the MCC secretary. After the game, Middlesex threatened to cancel their future matches against Yorkshire; rumours circulated that the Yorkshire captain Geoffrey Wilson had offered to resign and that Waddington would be dropped. Later in 1924, Yorkshire had another controversial match, this time against Surrey, where there were disputes on the field, but no official complaint was made. The editor of Wisden suggested that a handful of players were the root cause of Yorkshire's problem; Geoffrey Wilson resigned {{at the end of the}} season, and these events probably cost Macaulay a place in the England Test team. The Yorkshire cricketer and journalist Bill Bowes later recalled a story in circulation that Waddington had deliberately tripped and injured the Middlesex player J. W. Hearne around this period, although he did not specify if it was during the 1924 Sheffield match. Waddington ended the season with 69 wickets at an average of 21.55, but appeared less effective than before his injury.|$|E
5|$|Written by Christopher Priest, the {{opportunity}} to write this four-part story was offered to Priest after his previous script, Sealed Orders, had been cancelled. The scene breakdown was commissioned on 5 December 1980 and the scripts on 6 February 1981. Priest's story idea dealt with the 'secret' of what actually powered the TARDIS, in this case fear. Somewhere hidden inside the TARDIS was the one being the Doctor feared above all others, and the psychic {{tension between the two}} of them produced the energy to move through space and time. The story involved the Doctor having to confront and ultimately defeat this fear, and was designed to write out the character of Adric. After hearing nothing from the production office with regard to his completed scripts or his payment for them, Priest made contact with John Nathan-Turner. He was told that the scripts were unusable and that he would not be paid. After a bitter dispute Priest was paid and both Nathan-Turner and Eric Saward forced to pen a letter <b>of</b> <b>apology</b> over their treatment of the writer. The script was replaced by Saward's script Earthshock.|$|E

50|$|The {{first edition}} <b>of</b> the <b>Apology</b> <b>of</b> the Augsburg Confession was {{published}} in late April-early May 1531 in quarto format.

Some scholars believe the second edition is the better edition <b>of</b> the <b>Apology.</b> The Lutheran Church's formal collection of confessions in the Book of Concord refer to the first edition <b>of</b> the <b>Apology</b> when it is quoted in the Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord. The 1580 German edition of the Book of Concord used the translation <b>of</b> the <b>Apology</b> prepared by Justus Jonas, who rendered it freely based on Melanchthon's further editing.

40|$|<b>Apologies</b> {{are part}} <b>of</b> {{daily life and}} occur {{in a variety of}} contexts. A large body of {{literature}} on the effects <b>of</b> <b>apologies</b> indicated that apologies have a positive effect – those receiving apologies have more positive views of the transgressor (e. g., Bornstein, Rung, 2 ̆ 6 Miller, 2002; Goei, Roberty, Meyer, 2 ̆ 6 Carlyle, 1997; Robbennolt, 2003; Sitkin 2 ̆ 6 Beis, 1993; Takaku, 2000). An area of emerging research in the realm <b>of</b> <b>apologies</b> is in the area of medical malpractice. The research presented here sought to expand on the field <b>of</b> <b>apologies,</b> specifically by examining the effects <b>of</b> an <b>apology</b> in a medical malpractice case. After reading the facts of a medical malpractice case, participants watched a videotaped statement of the defendant, which contained either an apology or an excuse. Other manipulated variables included the familiarity between the plaintiff and defendant, how steadily the defendant maintained eye contact during his statement, and how quickly the defendant spoke while making his statement. Analyses revealed marginal main effects for statement type, eye contact and speech rate on ratings of sincerity. Main effects emerged for perceptions of the defendant – participants viewed him more favorably when he apologized. Implications and areas of future research are then discussed. Adviser: Brian H.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the press uptakes (news reports) <b>of</b> public <b>apologies</b> in Britain and France. Apology, as used here, includes unequivocal apologies, equivocal apologies and refusals to apologise. The approach adopted {{in this study}} is primarily data-driven and relies on a comprehensive bilingual (English and French) data set including 268 news texts. The two corpora are compared to reveal any cross-cultural variations pertaining to the speech act <b>of</b> public <b>apology.</b> The main goal of the research is to provide a new account <b>of</b> public <b>apologies</b> by combining methodologies from pragmatics, critical discourse analysis and corpus linguistics. The research presented has four main aims: - to further develop and re-interpret the four basic components <b>of</b> <b>apologies,</b> namely apologiser, apologisee, offence and remedy, in terms of their relation to public apology processes. This is achieved by emphasising the different ways used by public figures to apologise, the identity of apologisers and apologisees, and the types of offences involved in the corpora of media texts examined. - to describe the evaluative stancetaking in news texts {{in order to determine the}} degree of variation in the evaluative strategies identified in the immediate framing <b>of</b> verbatim <b>apologies,</b> and in the explicitly and implicitly evaluative metapragmatic comments found in the press uptakes. - to explore cross-cultural variations in the perception <b>of</b> public <b>apologies,</b> with the particular aim of gauging any differences in representations <b>of</b> these <b>apologies</b> in newspapers in Britain and in France. This perspective considers the extent to which press uptakes in each country are indicative of the ways in which discourse meanings are verbally and situationally bound. - to determine the ways in which ideology permeates press uptakes <b>of</b> public <b>apologies.</b> This is achieved by considering how evaluative stancetaking is used in the corpora, thereby accessing aspects of ideological positioning as represented in the media texts under scrutiny...|$|R
