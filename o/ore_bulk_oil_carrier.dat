5000|$|During 1918, {{the exigencies}} of the Great War necessitated the sale of Devitt and Moore's, then, only {{training}} ship, and it was sold to the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (later Royal Dutch Shell [...] ) for £41,000. The ship was then converted into a <b>bulk</b> <b>oil</b> <b>carrier</b> and renamed the Myr Shell and used for service in the Far East. Subsequently the Myr Shell became an oil depot ship in Singapore before being sold to Japanese shipbreakers for £1,500 in 1933.|$|R

[...] "OBO" [...] describes a bulker which carries a combination of <b>ore,</b> <b>bulk,</b> and <b>oil,</b> and [...] "O/O" [...] is used for combination <b>oil</b> and ore <b>carriers.</b> The terms [...] "VLOC," [...] "VLBC," [...] "ULOC," [...] and [...] "ULBC" [...] for very large and ultra large <b>ore</b> and <b>bulk</b> carriers were adapted from the supertanker designations {{very large crude carrier}} and ultra large crude carrier.|$|R
5000|$|Often {{criticized by}} marine writers (and some seamen) and {{considered}} difficult to maneuver and sluggish (comparisons to a [...] "bath tub" [...] and a [...] "beached whale" [...] were made), Thomas W. Lawson proved problematic in the ports she {{was intended to}} operate in due {{to the amount of}} water she displaced. She tended to yaw and needed a strong wind to be held on course. Originally built for the Pacific trade, the schooner was used as collier along the American East Coast. A year later in 1903, Crowley withdrew her from the coal trade. He had the topmasts, gaff booms and all other wooden spars removed and had chartered her out as a sea-going barge for the transportation of case oil. In 1906, she was retrofitted for sail at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company for use as a <b>bulk</b> <b>oil</b> <b>carrier</b> using the lower steel masts to vent oil gasses from the holds. Her capacity was 60,000 barrels. Under charter to Sun Oil Company, she was the world's first pure sailing tanker, carrying <b>bulk</b> <b>oil</b> from Texas to the eastern seaboard.|$|R
500|$|At {{the site}} of the Purton Hulks there is less than [...] of land between the river and the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal (or Gloucester and Berkeley Canal). The [...] canal was dug between Gloucester and Sharpness; for much of its length it runs close to the [...] tidal River Severn, but cuts off a {{significant}} loop in the river, at a once-dangerous bend near Arlingham. It was once the broadest and deepest canal in the world. Conceived in the Canal Mania period of the late 18th century, the Gloucester and Berkeley Ship Canal scheme was authorised by a 1793 Act of Parliament. The canal opened in April 1827, having cost £440,000 in the course of its construction. The flood plain of the Severn hereabouts is very flat and so the elevation of the canal does not require any rise over its length. Outside the dock areas at each end, there are no locks. This encouraged the use of the canal for ships larger than on most other British canals, although {{there were a number of}} swing bridges to negotiate. As opened the canal was [...] wide, [...] deep and could take craft of up to 600 tons. In 1905 traffic exceeded one million tons for the first time. Oil was added to the list of cargoes carried by the canal, with <b>bulk</b> <b>oil</b> <b>carriers</b> taking fuel to storage tanks sited to the south of Gloucester.|$|R

40|$|Lipid {{oxidation}} is a {{great concern}} for food manufacturers and consumers as it negatively impacts not only food quality and nutritive values of food lipids, but also consumer health. Lipid oxidation in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil</b> is impacted by chemical factors, such as, prooxidants and antioxidants, and is also related {{to the existence of}} physical structures. <b>Bulk</b> <b>oils</b> contain a variety of surface active minor components which are able to form physical structures known as association colloids. These physical structures create oil-water interfaces which seem to be an important site where lipid oxidation occurs in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> Thus, this research focused on how the surface active minor components in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil</b> impact physical structure formation and oxidative stability in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> In the first study, the influence of polar lipid oxidation products isolated from used frying oil on the oxidative stability of <b>bulk</b> <b>oils</b> and oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions was investigated. Polar compounds were added to <b>bulk</b> stripped corn <b>oil</b> (with and without reverse micelles formed by dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, DOPC) and O/W emulsion to evaluate their prooxidative activity by following the formation of lipid hydroperoxides and hexanal. Polar compounds increased lipid oxidation in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil</b> with and without DOPC. The presence of DOPC reverse micelles decreased the prooxidant activity of the polar oxidation products. On the other hand, there was no significant effect of the polar compounds on oxidation of O/W emulsions. ix Besides phospholipids, other surface active minor components in commercial oils such as free fatty acids may impact lipid oxidation rates and the physical properties of association colloids. Thus, in the second study, the effects of free fatty acids on changes in the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of DOPC in stripped corn oil were determined by using the 7, 7, 8, 8 -tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) solubilization technique. Different free fatty acids including myristoleic, oleic, elaidic, linoleic and eicosenoic were added at 0. 5 % by wt along with the DOPC (1 - 2000 μmol/kg <b>oil)</b> into the <b>bulk</b> <b>oils.</b> There was no significant effect of free fatty acids with different chain length, configuration and number of double bonds on the CMC value for DOPC in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> However, increasing concentrations of oleic acid (0. 5, 1, 3 and 5 % by wt) caused the CMC value for DOPC in <b>bulk</b> <b>oils</b> to increase from 400 to 1000 μmol/kg oil. Physical properties of DOPC reverse micelles in the presence of free fatty acids in <b>bulk</b> <b>oils</b> were also investigated by the small angle X-ray scattering technique. Results showed that free fatty acid could impact on the reverse micelle structure of DOPC in <b>bulk</b> <b>oils.</b> Moreover, free fatty acid decreased pH inside reverse micelle as confirmed by the NMR studies. The oxidation studies revealed that free fatty acids exhibited prooxidative activity in the presence and absence of DOPC. Different types of free fatty acids had similar prooxidative activity in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> In the last experiment, multiple surface active minor components including DOPC, dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), oleic acid, diacylglycerols (DAG) and stigmasterol were incorporated to form nanostructures in stripped corn oil. Individual component significantly decreased the oil-water interfacial tension on which the DOPC and DOPE exhibited the strongest impact. However, the CMC study shows that only DOPC and DOPE could form aggregates at the CMC of 40 and 200 μmol/kg oil. The CMC of the mixed components was as low as 20 μmol/kg oil. The absence of a component did not significantly change the CMC value. x However, in the absence of DOPC, {{we were not able to}} observe the CMC of the mixed components in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> The NBD-PE probe was used to study the interfacial activity of minor components. The addition of mixed components caused the emission fluorescence intensity increase, suggesting that these components were at the oil-water interface. Again, the absence of a component from the mixture did not significantly change the fluorescence intensity, except when lacking of the DOPC. This indicates that the DOPC plays an important role on association colloid formation. The oxidation study showed that the association colloids formed by adding 100 μmol/kg oil of mixed components decreased the oxidative stability of <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> In addition, the impact of mixed minor components at below (10 μmol/kg oil) and above their CMC (100 μmol/kg oil) on antioxidant activity of α-tocopherol and Trolox (water soluble derivative of tocopherols) at 10 and 50 μmol/kg oil was investigated. The addition of α-tocopherol and Trolox at 10 μmol/kg oil already compensated the prooxidant activity of association colloids. Trolox exhibited stronger antioxidant activity than α-tocopherol. However, the association colloids did not influence the antioxidative effectiveness of either α-tocopherol or Trolox in this study. In conclusion, the surface active minor components formed complex association colloids that decreased the oxidative stability of <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> The presence of reverse micelle impacted the physical location of components such as polar lipid substrates, thus influenced their prooxidant activity. The physicochemical properties of association colloids could change according to the composition of minor components presenting at the oil-water interface. For example, the addition of free fatty acids extended the CMC and altered the pH of the water core of DOPC reverse micelles. The combination of multiple surface active components physically and chemically impacted the oxidative stability and activity of antioxidants in <b>bulk</b> <b>oil.</b> This research xi demonstrates what happens in real commercial oils which are complicated and could provide an idea of how to protect the oil from lipid oxidation...|$|R

5000|$|The tramp trade {{first took}} off in Britain around the mid 19th century. The {{dependability}} and timeliness of steam ships {{was found to be}} more cost-effective than sail. Coal was needed for ships' boilers, and the demand created a business opportunity for moving large amounts of best Welsh coal to various seaports in Britain. Within a few years tramp ships became the workhorses of trade, transporting coal and finished products from British cities {{to the rest of the}} world. [...] The size of tramp ships remained relatively constant from 1900 to 1940, at about 7,000 to 10,000 deadweight tons (dwt.). During the Second World War, the United States created the Liberty Ship; a single design that could be used to carry just about anything, which weighed in at 10,500 dwt. [...] The U.S. produced 2,708 Liberty Ships and they were used on every international trade route. [...] After the Second World War, economies of scale took over and the size of tramp ships exploded to keep up with a booming supply and demand cycle. During this time the bulk carrier became the tramp of choice for many owners and operators. The bulk carrier was designed to carry coal, grain and ore, which gave it more flexibility and could service more ports than some of its ancestors, which only carried a single commodity. [...] Today the tramp trade includes all types of vessels, from bulk carriers to tankers. Each can be used for a specific market, or ships can be combined like the <b>oil,</b> <b>bulk,</b> <b>ore</b> <b>carriers</b> to accommodate many different markets depending where the ship is located and the supply and demand of the area. Tramp ships often carry with them their own gear (booms, cranes, derricks) in case the next port lacks the proper equipment for loading or discharging cargo.|$|R
