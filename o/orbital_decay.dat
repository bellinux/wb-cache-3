Detection of these waves is a major goal of current relativity-related research. Several land-based gravitational wave detectors are currently in operation, most notably the interferometric detectors GEO 600, LIGO (two detectors), TAMA 300 and VIRGO. Various pulsar timing arrays are using millisecond pulsars to detect gravitational waves in the 10−9 to 10−6 Hertz frequency range, which originate from binary supermassive blackholes. A European space-based detector, eLISA / NGO, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) having launched in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|The crew of EO-27, Viktor Afanasyev and Jean-Pierre Haigneré, {{arrived in}} Soyuz TM-29 on 22 February 1999 {{alongside}} Ivan Bella, {{who returned to}} Earth with Padalka in Soyuz TM-28. The crew carried out three EVAs to retrieve experiments and deploy a prototype communications antenna on Sofora. On 1 June {{it was announced that}} the deorbit of the station would be delayed by six months to allow time to seek alternative funding to keep the station operating. The rest of the expedition was spent preparing the station for its deorbit; a special analog computer was installed and each of the modules, starting with the docking module, was mothballed in turn and sealed off. The crew loaded their results into Soyuz TM-29 and departed Mir on 28 August 1999, ending a run of continuous occupation, which had lasted for eight days short of ten years. The station's gyrodines and main computer were shut down on 7 September, leaving Progress M-42 to control Mir and refine the station's <b>orbital</b> <b>decay</b> rate.|$|E

This corresponds to a period change of - 0. 88 ± 0. 27 μ s per orbital cycle. We have also collected {{observations of}} the black hole X-ray binary A 0620 [...] 00 to derive an orbital period derivative of Ṗ=- 0. 60 ± 0. 08 ms yr^- 1 (- 0. 53 ± 0. 07 μ s/cycle). Angular momentum losses due to gravitational radiation are unable to explain these large <b>orbital</b> <b>decays</b> in these two short-period black hole binaries. The <b>orbital</b> period <b>decay</b> measured in A 0620 [...] 00 is very marginally consistent with the predictions of conventional models including magnetic braking, although significant mass loss (Ṁ_ BH / Ṁ_ 2 < 20 %) from the system is required. The fast spiral-in of the star in XTE J 1118 + 480, however, does not fit any standard model and may be driven by magnetic braking under extremely high magnetic fields and/or may require an unknown process or non-standard theories of gravity. This result may suggest an evolutionary sequence in which the <b>orbital</b> period <b>decay</b> begins to speed up as the orbital period decreases.

25|$|<b>Orbital</b> <b>decay</b> {{can occur}} due to tidal forces for objects below the {{synchronous}} orbit {{for the body}} they're orbiting. The gravity of the orbiting object raises tidal bulges in the primary, and since below the synchronous orbit the orbiting object is moving faster than the body's surface the bulges lag a short angle behind it. The gravity of the bulges is slightly off of the primary-satellite axis and thus has a component along the satellite's motion. The near bulge slows the object more than the far bulge speeds it up, {{and as a result}} the orbit decays. Conversely, the gravity of the satellite on the bulges applies torque on the primary and speeds up its rotation. Artificial satellites are too small to have an appreciable tidal effect on the planets they orbit, but several moons in the solar system are undergoing <b>orbital</b> <b>decay</b> by this mechanism. Mars' innermost moon Phobos is a prime example, and is expected to either impact Mars' surface or break up into a ring within 50 million years.|$|E

40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{detectable}} pulsations in the eclipsing High Mass X-ray binary 4 U 1700 - 37, the <b>orbital</b> period <b>decay</b> is necessarily determined from the eclipse timing measurements. We have used the earlier reported mid-eclipse time measurements of 4 U 1700 - 37 together with the new measurements from long term light curves obtained with the all sky monitors RXTE-ASM, Swift-BAT and MAXI-GSC, as well as observations with RXTE-PCA, to measure the long term orbital evolution of the binary. The <b>orbital</b> period <b>decay</b> rate {{of the system is}} estimated to be Ṗ/P = -(4. 7 ± 1. 9) × 10 ^- 7 yr^- 1, smaller compared to its previous estimates. We have also used the mid-eclipse times and the eclipse duration measurements obtained from 10 years long X-ray light-curve with Swift-BAT to separately put constraints on the eccentricity of the binary system and attempted to measure any apsidal motion. For an apsidal motion rate greater than 5 degrees per year, the eccentricity is found to be less than 0. 008, which limits our ability to determine the apsidal motion rate from the current data. We discuss the discrepancy of the current limit of eccentricity with the earlier reported values from radial velocity measurements of the companion star.

40|$|Using 3 D radiation-hydrodynamic {{simulations}} and analytic theory, {{we study}} the orbital evolution of asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) binary systems for various initial orbital separations and mass ratios, and thus different initial accretion modes. The time evolution of binary separations and orbital periods are calculated {{directly from the}} averaged mass loss rate, accretion rate and angular momentum loss rate. We separately consider spin-orbit synchronized and zero spin AGB cases. We find that the the angular momentum carried away by the mass loss together with the mass transfer can effectively shrink the orbit when accretion occurs via wind-Roche-lobe overflow. In contrast, the larger fraction of mass lost in Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accreting systems acts to enlarge the orbit. Synchronized binaries tend to experience stronger <b>orbital</b> period <b>decay</b> in close binaries. We also find that <b>orbital</b> period <b>decay</b> is faster when we account for the nonlinear evolution of the accretion mode as the binary starts to tighten. This can increase the fraction of binaries that result in common envelope, luminous red novae, Type Ia supernovae and planetary nebulae with tight central binaries.

The one particle operator content of these integrals of motion is related to the one particle orbitals of the one particle density matrix and shows a strong signature across the MBL transition as recently pointed out by Bera et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 046603 (2015); Ann. Phys. 529, 1600356 (2017) ]. We study the properties of the one particle orbitals of many-body eigenstates of an MBL system in one dimension. Using shift-and-invert MPS (SIMPS), a matrix product state method to target highly excited many-body eigenstates introduced in [Phys. Rev.

We find that the one particle orbitals drawn from eigenstates at different energy densities have high overlap and their occupations are correlated with the energy of the eigenstates. Moreover, the standard deviation of the inverse participation ratio of these orbitals is maximal at the nose of the mobility edge. Also, the one particle <b>orbitals</b> <b>decay</b> exponentially in real space, with a correlation length that increases at low disorder.
