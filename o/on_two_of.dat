5|$|Guitar Solos {{was voted}} {{one of the}} best albums of 1974 by NME critics. AllMusic called it a {{landmark}} album because of its innovative and experimental approach to guitar playing. It also attracted the attention of Brian Eno, resulting in Frith's playing guitar <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Eno's albums, and spawned two follow-up albums, Guitar Solos 2 (1976) and Guitar Solos 3 (1979). Guitar Solos was remastered and released on CD on Frith's own record label, Fred Records, in 2002.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914, Spee led his squadron across the Pacific to the coast of South America. Here on 1 November, he defeated the British 4th Cruiser Squadron under Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock in the Battle of Coronel, sinking two of Cradock's cruisers and forcing his other two ships to retreat. A month later, Spee decided to attack the British naval base in the Falkland Islands, though a superior British force surprised him. In the ensuing Battle of the Falkland Islands, Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee's squadron, which included two powerful battlecruisers, destroyed the East Asia Squadron. Spee and his two sons, {{who happened to be}} serving <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> his ships, were all killed, along with about 2,200 other men. Spee was hailed as a hero in Germany, and several ships were named in his honor, including the heavy cruiser , which was built in the 1930s and was defeated in the Battle of the River Plate during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Cyrus {{starred in}} the feature film , and began {{cultivating}} a more mature image with her EP The Time of Our Lives in 2009. In 2010, she released her third album Can't Be Tamed, which stands as the lowest-selling record of her career, and {{starred in the}} coming-of-age film The Last Song. Cyrus focused on her acting career with several television and film appearances in 2011 and 2012. Her sexually explicit behavior generated widespread controversy while promoting her fourth album Bangerz (2013), her first under her recording contract with RCA Records. Cyrus' independently-released fifth studio album Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015) deviated from her traditional pop style for more psychedelic experimentation. The following year, she became a coach on the singing competition television series The Voice; she has since appeared <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> its thirteen seasons. Cyrus returned to a more wholesome image with her sixth studio album Younger Now (2017).|$|E

5|$|During the trial, {{the defense}} {{presents}} evidence that Deng {{was convicted of}} prostitution two years ago. Deng denies the charge and says she had been gang-raped by the soldiers who killed her husband. Deng's credibility weakens further when the defense presents a surprise witness, Daniel Achok, who testifies that he had advised her to fabricate the gang rape on her application for political asylum. The jury reached verdicts <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the three charges, finding DiStasio guilty of unlawful imprisonment and not guilty of assault but deadlocks on the rape charge, and Benson says that he will likely serve a year in prison.|$|E

5|$|In November 2012, The FreeBSD Security Team {{announced}} that hackers gained unauthorized access <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the project's servers. These servers were turned off immediately.

Apparently hackers gained access to these servers by stealing SSH keys {{from one of the}} developers, not by exploiting a bug in the operating system itself. These two hacked servers were part of the infrastructure used to build third-party software packages. The FreeBSD Security Team checked the integrity of the binary packages and {{announced that}} no unauthorized change was made to the binary packages, but they stated that they can't guarantee the integrity of packages that were downloaded between 19 September and 11 November.|$|E
5|$|In the US {{the song}} was {{released}} as a radio-only single, and was therefore ineligible to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs. However, it peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 Airplay and number nine on the Hot Dance Club Songs charts. Author Fred Bronson noted it likely {{would have been the}} album's eighth top ten hit if a commercial product had been distributed. In Australia, the song received a commercial release, and peaked at number 94 on the ARIA Singles Chart in July 1991.

5|$|On April 4, 1955, a United Airlines check captain, Stanley C. Hoyt, age 45, was {{carrying}} out instrument rating checks <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the airline's pilots.

Webb, age 35, so {{they would be able}} to retain an instrument rating qualification, allowing them to fly under instrument flight rules. The aircraft was a Douglas DC-6, registration N37512, serial number 43001. The airframe had flown 22,068 flying hours, and had undergone an inspection 105 hours before the accident. The aircraft was powered by four Pratt & Whitney R2800-CB16 engines, fitted with Hamilton Standard 43E60-317 propellers.|$|E
5|$|Overseen by Cyril Lovesey, {{flight testing}} {{commenced}} on 4 August 1929 {{in the new}} Supermarine S.6 at RAF Calshot, a seaplane and flying boat station on Southampton Water in Hampshire. During pre-race scrutineering tests, metal particles were found <b>on</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the engine's 24 spark plugs indicating a piston failure which would require an engine re-build or replacement. The competition rules did not allow an engine change, but due to the foresight of Ernest Hives, several Rolls-Royce engineers and mechanics that {{were familiar with the}} R had travelled down to Southampton to witness the trials, and with their assistance one cylinder bank was removed, the damaged piston replaced and the cylinder refurbished. This work was completed overnight and allowed the team to continue in the competition.|$|E
