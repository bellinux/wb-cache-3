5|$|Around {{this time}} he adopted his famous style <b>of</b> <b>dressing,</b> {{consisting}} of a knee-length one-piece Kafni robe and a cloth cap. Ramgir Bua, a devotee, testified that Sai Baba was dressed like an athlete and sported 'long hair flowing down {{to the end of}} his spine' when he arrived in Shirdi, and that he never had his head shaved. It was only after Baba forfeited a wrestling match with one Mohiddin Tamboli that he took up the kafni and cloth cap, articles of typical Sufi clothing. This attire contributed to Baba's identification as a Muslim fakir and was a reason for initial indifference and hostility against him in a predominantly Hindu village.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with Tandy in 1948 and {{continuing}} {{into the early}} 1950s, Nancy's appearance was updated to follow the current styles. In postwar opulence, a trend emerged for young adults {{to have their own}} casual style, instead <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> in the same styles as more mature adults, and Nancy becomes less constrained. Sweater or blouse and skirt ensembles, as well as a pageboy hairstyle, were introduced in 1948, and continued with new artist Bill Gillies, who updated 10 covers and illustrated three new jackets from 1950 to 1952. Gillies used his wife for a model, and Nancy reflects the conservative 1950s, with immaculately waved hair and a limited wardrobe– she wears similar sweater, blouse, and skirt ensembles, in different combinations, on most of these covers. Gillies also designed the modern-era trademark as a spine symbol which was used for decades: Nancy's head in profile, looking through a quizzing glass.|$|E
5|$|Madonna's {{look and}} style <b>of</b> <b>dressing,</b> her performances, and her music videos {{influenced}} young girls and women. Her style {{became one of}} the female fashion trends of the 1980s. Created by stylist and jewelry designer Maripol, the look consisted of lace tops, skirts over capri pants, fishnet stockings, jewelry bearing the crucifix, bracelets, and bleached hair.

It became her first number-one album in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, the UK, and the US. Like a Virgin was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America and sold more than 21 million copies worldwide.|$|E

The narrator (Murali Mohan) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Siddharth 'Siddhu' Addala (Siddharth) begins verbally abusing all the fathers in the world. When queried about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind (Prakash Raj), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices <b>of</b> <b>dressing,</b> hairstyle, and many others are overruled by his father's. However, he vows that his career and the woman he marries will be his own choice.|$|E
5|$|From 1807 to 1809, Champollion {{studied in}} Paris, under Silvestre de Sacy, the first Frenchman {{to attempt to}} read the Rosetta stone, and with orientalist Louis-Mathieu Langlès, and with Raphaël de Monachis who was now in Paris. Here he perfected his Arabic and Persian, in {{addition}} to the languages that he had already acquired. He was so immersed in his studies that he took up the habit <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> in Arab clothing and calling himself Al Seghir, the Arab translation of le jeune. He divided his time between the College of France, the Special School of Oriental Languages, the National Library where his brother was a librarian and the Commission of Egypt, the institution in charge of publishing the findings of the Egyptian expedition. In 1808, he first began studying the Rosetta stone, working from a copy made by the Abbé de Tersan. Working independently he was able to confirm some of the readings of the demotic previously made by Johan David Åkerblad in 1802, finally identifying the Coptic equivalents of fifteen demotic signs present on the Rosetta stone.|$|E

25|$|Alongside the music, a way <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> {{emerged that}} gave baggy its name. Baggy jeans (often flared) {{alongside}} brightly coloured or tie-dye casual tops and general '60s style became fashionable first in Manchester and then {{across the country}} – frequently topped off with a fishing hat in the style sported by the Stone Roses' drummer Reni. The overall look was part rave, part retro or part hippie, part football casual. Many Madchester bands had football casual fans {{and a number of}} bands even wore football shirts.

Fortunately, Jouett had the eccentric habit <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> in ornate military costume with a scarlet coat and a plumed hat and Stevens was dressed in shoddy clothing. British cavalry assumed that Jouett must be a high military officer, so they ignored the shabby general, and pursued Jouett, who successfully eluded them.|$|E
25|$|Many outergarments like sundresses, tank tops, {{and formal}} evening wear are {{designed}} to be worn without bras. Fashion writers continue to suggest alternatives to bras or ways <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> without bras, emphasising that wearing a bra is a matter of choice and not a requirement. Given the discomfort women experience with ill-fitting bras, an increasing number of women, once they are home, are switching to undershirts, jogbras, or nothing at all. Unhappy bra owners have donated thousands of bras to the Braball Sculpture, a collection of 18,085 bras. The organizer, Emily Duffy, wears a 42B and switched to stretch undershirts with built-in bras because standard bras cut her midsection.|$|E
25|$|Later on in {{the history}} of the Dutch East Indies, as a new wave of Europeans were brought into the colony, many adopted the Indonesian styles, many even went so far as to wear {{traditional}} Javanese kebaya at home.

For the most part, Europeans in the Dutch East Indies, stuck to traditional European styles <b>of</b> <b>dressing.</b> Fashion trends from Paris were still highly regarded and considered the epitome of style. Women wore dresses and skirts and men wore pants and shirts.|$|E

50|$|In modern Pagan religions, such as Wicca, {{there is}} no one {{specific}} form <b>of</b> <b>dress</b> designated for the clergy.

However, there is a traditional form <b>of</b> <b>dress,</b> (usually a floor-length tunic and a knotted cord cincture, known as the cingulum), which is often worn by worshipers during religious rites. Among those traditions of Wicca that do dictate a specific form <b>of</b> <b>dress</b> for its clergy, they usually wear the traditional tunic in addition to other articles of clothing (such as an open-fronted robe or a cloak) as a distinctive form <b>of</b> religious <b>dress,</b> similar to a habit.|$|R
25|$|Boy George's {{androgynous}} style <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> {{caught the}} attention of music entrepreneur Malcolm McLaren (previously the manager of the Sex Pistols), who arranged for George to perform with the group Bow Wow Wow. Going by the stage name Lieutenant Lush, his tenure with Bow Wow Wow proved problematic with lead singer Annabella Lwin. George eventually left the group and started his own band with bassist Mikey Craig. They were joined by Jon Moss (who had drumming stints with the Damned and Adam and the Ants) and then guitarist Roy Hay. Realising they had a cross-dressing Irish singer (George), a black-Briton (Craig), a Jewish drummer (Moss) and an ethnic Englishman (Hay), they settled on the name Culture Club, referring to the various ethnic backgrounds of the members.|$|E
25|$|Stuart Hall and Tony Jefferson {{argue that}} {{compared}} to other youth subcultures, the mod scene gave young women high visibility and relative autonomy. They write that this status may have been related both to {{the attitudes of the}} mod young men, who accepted the idea that a young woman {{did not have to be}} attached to a man, and to the development of new occupations for young women, which gave them an income and made them more independent. Hall and Jefferson note the increasing number of jobs in boutiques and women's clothing stores, which, while poorly paid and lacking opportunities for advancement, gave young women disposable income, status and a glamorous sense <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> up and going downtown to work.|$|E
25|$|The Frog Baby statue {{has been}} the center of legend and {{tradition}} since it was presented by Frank Ball in 1937.

Over the years, the nose was worn away, and in 1993, the statue was sent overseas for refurbishment. Today, Frog Baby is situated in a fountain on University Green. Since its move and restoration, students have started a new tradition <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> the statue to reflect weather patterns (scarves and hats in the winter) or current university events (jerseys and helmets for upcoming football games). Despite 24/7 surveillance, the statue has been a repeated target of vandals.|$|E
