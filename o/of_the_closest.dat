5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} exist {{that are of}} interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth, the Pleiades and the Hyades, {{both of which are}} visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the red giant Aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the supernova remnant Messier 1, more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into {{the northern part of the}} constellation. The variable star T Tauri is the prototype of a class of pre-main-sequence stars.|$|E
5|$|All but six of Senna's 41 {{victories}} {{were for}} McLaren, and 32 of his wins were in cars with a Honda engine. Of his remaining nine victories, five were achieved with Ford powered cars, and four with Renault. He was most successful at Monaco, where he won six times during his career, including a record five consecutive times between 1989 and 1993. His largest {{margin of victory}} was 1:23.199 at the 1993 European Grand Prix, while the narrowest margin was at the 1986 Spanish Grand Prix, when he beat Nigel Mansell by 0.014 seconds, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> finishes in Formula One.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Financial Accounting)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. <b>The</b> report <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{accounting}} officer {{is of little}} or no value. There is uncertainty about <b>the</b> duties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{accounting officer}} where there are material omissions and mistakes in the accounting records and financial statements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> corporation because <b>the</b> report <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accounting officer must only state that the financial statements are {{in agreement with the}} accounting records. Nowhere in <b>the</b> <b>Close</b> Corporation Act it is stated what <b>the</b> duties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accounting officer are whether he is aware or not of such mistakes or omissions. <b>The</b> <b>close</b> corporation doesn't require the accounting officer to do an audit on the books and records <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> corporation, and <b>the</b> accounting officers are therefore under the impression that they may not be held liable for all <b>the</b> debts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> corporation. <b>The</b> accounting officer is however vulnerable as his duties in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Close</b> Corporation Act are far reaching and he cannot fulfil his duties completely unless he has done an audit, and can therefore be held liable for <b>the</b> debts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> corporation. He can further be held liable for <b>the</b> debts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> corporation due to the following: 7. 1 the shortcomings in <b>the</b> <b>Close</b> Corporation Act nr. 69 of 1984; 7. 2 <b>the</b> impracticability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Close</b> Corporation Act; 7. 3 the vagueness and indistinctness of certain articles in the Act that the accounting officer must comply with or are exposed to; 7. 4 the accounting officer may use his professional judgment to investigate <b>the</b> accounting records <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> corporation, and nothing prohibits him to do so if he think it lit. If however he is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opinion that {{it is not necessary to}} investigate the accounting records, this will contribute towards the accounting officer becoming liable for <b>the</b> debts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> corporation, although <b>the</b> Act doesn't require the accounting officer to do an audit on the books and records <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> corporation. In <b>the</b> case where the accounting officer decides to investigate the books and records <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> corporation, his duties are extensive because he takes the decision to investigate. 7. 5 The accounting officer act in many cases as advisor/bookkeeper/ accountant for <b>the</b> CC, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size and nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entity, and by doing that, he then participates in <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CC and he is then vulnerable in terms of section 64 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Close</b> Corporation Act to be liable for all <b>the</b> debts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corporation, without being the accounting officer's intention to participate in <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> corporation. 7. 6 <b>The</b> powers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accounting officer are not fully addressed in <b>the</b> <b>Close</b> Corporation Act and the accounting officer is not properly protected by <b>the</b> Act. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current <b>Close</b> Corporations Act, <b>the</b> interpretation and use thereof, the accounting officer is excessively vulnerable to creditors and third parties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> corporation and he can be held liable for all <b>the</b> debts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> corporation. Amendments and changes to the act are necessary to clarify <b>the</b> duties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accounting officer and to get certainty about certain articles in the Act which are vague.

5|$|Although fainter {{than its}} {{northern}} counterpart, the oval- or horseshoe-shaped pattern of its brighter stars renders it distinctive. Alpha and Beta Coronae Australis {{are the two}} brightest stars with an apparent magnitude of around 4.1. Epsilon Coronae Australis is the brightest example of a W Ursae Majoris variable in the southern sky. Lying alongside the Milky Way, Corona Australis contains one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> star-forming regions to the Solar System—a dusty dark nebula known as the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, lying about 430 light years away.

5|$|Despite the {{disappointment}} {{of the previous}} season, Arsenal won their seventh League title in 1952–53; in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> title races, they beat Preston North End to the title on goal average after finishing level on points. The title looked to be Preston's after Arsenal lost to them 2–0 at Deepdale in the penultimate game of the season, but Arsenal came from behind to beat Burnley 3–2, to take the title on 0.099 of a goal. That proved to be Arsenal's last trophy for seventeen years, as Arsenal's fortunes began to wane, particularly after the unexpected death of Tom Whittaker in October 1956.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> {{polls in}} UK history, Sir Harmar Nicholls held the seat by three votes after seven recounts. Nicholls was the Conservative member from 1950 to 1974, {{when he lost}} in the October {{election}} of that year to Labour's Michael Ward, having held on by just 22 votes after four recounts in the election eight months earlier. The growth in the New Town from 1967 may in part account for Labour's victory here in 1974. In 1979, however, Ward lost the seat to the Conservative Brian Mawhinney, who would represent Peterborough for the entire duration of the incoming Conservative government and was a Cabinet Minister and Conservative Party Chairman during the second Major government (1992–97).|$|E

The Conservatives remained in power with 23 seats to the Liberals' 20. Economic conditions worsened after {{the stock market crash}} of 1929 making it seem increasingly likely that the Liberals would return to power in the next election. Macdonald helped draft a 15-point party platform for approval at a Liberal convention in the fall of 1930. It promised an eight-hour working day and free elementary school textbooks. It also pledged to establish a formal inquiry into Nova Scotia's economic prospects and the province's place within Confederation.|$|E

30|$|As can be observed, the Chhabdi Khola {{river basin}} {{is an area}} largely covered by (open and closed) forest (fluctuating at around a little over 60 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total area from 1990 to 2015).

5|$|In the November 1980 general elections, Governor Romero Barceló was re-elected by {{a margin}} of 3,503 votes (one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> in Puerto Rico history), though his party lost control of the state {{legislature}} to the main opposition party, the PPD. This loss was attributed by The New York Times to the surrounding controversy regarding the investigations at the time. Other news organizations, such as Time, attributed the loss to Gov. Romero Barcelo's stance on the island's political status. The Legislature quickly started new inquiries and hearings into the Cerro Maravilla incident. The Senate, then presided by Miguel Hernández Agosto, spearheaded the investigations by naming former Assistant District Attorney Hector Rivera Cruz to investigate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the north}} of the {{constellation}} is the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, a dark molecular cloud with many embedded reflection nebulae, including NGC 6729, NGC 6726–7, and IC 4812.

About 430 light years (130 parsecs) away, it is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> star-forming regions to the Solar System. The related NGC 6726 and 6727, along with unrelated NGC 6729, were first recorded by Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt in 1865.

5|$|Just as the Germans {{had made}} the halt decision, the Soviet Kalinin, Western and Southwestern Fronts {{launched}} a massive counteroffensive, aimed at driving Army Group Centre back from Moscow. The attacks were especially strong against Third Panzer Group, which had made some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> penetrations to the city. In three weeks of confused, savage fighting, Reinhardt extricated his troops from potential encirclement and fell back to the Lama River line. Placed in charge of covering the retreat, Model's harsh, almost brutal, style of leadership now paid dividends as panic threatened to infect the German columns. On several occasions, he restored order at a congested crossroads with a drawn pistol, but the retreat never became a rout.|$|E

Evidence for P. rebeli oviposition depending upon the range of the food plant rather than the range of the ants is supported by the timing of its oviposition. P. rebeli lays their eggs during the warm summer season, when Myrmica ants are most likely to be underground. Researchers also observed females did not base their oviposition on where they found Myrmica nests.|$|E
5|$|The constellation's {{brightest}} star, Alpha Gruis, is {{also known}} as Alnair and appears as a 1.7-magnitude blue-white star. Beta Gruis is a red giant variable star with a minimum magnitude of 2.3 and a maximum magnitude of 2.0. Six star systems have been found to have planets: the red dwarf Gliese 832 is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> stars to Earth to have a planetary system. Another—WASP-95—has a planet that orbits every two days. Deep-sky objects found in Grus include the planetary nebula IC 5148, also known as the Spare Tyre Nebula, and a group of four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet.|$|E
5|$|Canis Minor {{contains}} only two stars {{brighter than the}} fourth magnitude, Procyon (Alpha Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 0.34, and Gomeisa (Beta Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 2.9.

Procyon is the seventh-brightest star in the night sky, {{as well as one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest.</b> A yellow-white main sequence star, it has a white dwarf companion. Gomeisa is a blue-white main sequence star. Luyten's Star is a ninth-magnitude red dwarf and the Solar System's next closest stellar neighbour in the constellation after Procyon. The fourth-magnitude HD 66141, which has evolved into an orange giant towards the end of its life cycle, was discovered to have a planet in 2012. There are two faint deep sky objects within the constellation's borders. The 11 Canis-Minorids are a meteor shower that can be seen in early December.|$|E

5|$|Emotion-oriented {{interventions}} include reminiscence therapy, validation therapy, supportive psychotherapy, sensory integration, {{also called}} snoezelen, and simulated presence therapy. A Cochrane review has {{found no evidence}} that this is effective. Supportive psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness. Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. Although there are few quality studies on the effectiveness of RT, it may be beneficial for cognition and mood. Simulated presence therapy (SPT) is based on attachment theories and involves playing a recording with voices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> relatives of the person with Alzheimer's disease. There is partial evidence indicating that SPT may reduce challenging behaviours.|$|E
5|$|The maxillary toothrows are {{parallel}} to each other. The molars are bunodont (with the cusps {{higher than the}} connecting crests) and brachyodont (low-crowned) and have the inter-cusp valleys on the labial (outer) sides closed by a cingulum (shelf). The valleys on the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molars meet at the midlines. Each of the upper molars has three roots—unlike in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> relatives of Pennatomys, there is no additional labial root on M1. The m1 has four roots—two large roots at {{the front and back}} and two smaller ones in the middle. There are three roots under m2, two at the front and one at the back, and two under m3, at the front and back. Upper toothrow length ranges from 5.6 to 6.7mm and lower toothrow length is 5.9 to 7.4mm.|$|E
5|$|The series {{then moved}} on to Britain, where Roberts would be {{involved}} in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> races in Grand Prix history. Roberts' battle with Sheene at the 1979 British Grand Prix at Silverstone has been cited {{as one of the greatest}} races of the 1970s. Minutes before the start of the race, Roberts' Yamaha blew a seal and sprayed the bike with oil. His crew managed to replace the seal in time, but Roberts went to the starting line with his gloves coated with oil, causing his hand to slip on the throttle during the race. The race began with Roberts, Sheene and Dutch rider Wil Hartog breaking away from the rest of the field of riders. Hartog eventually fell behind as Roberts and Sheene continued to battle for the lead. The event featured numerous lead changes throughout the 28 lap race, with Roberts winning ahead of Sheene by a narrow margin of just three-tenths of a second. A third-place finish in the season-ending French Grand Prix, along with a crash by his main championship rival Ferrari, secured his second consecutive world championship.|$|E
