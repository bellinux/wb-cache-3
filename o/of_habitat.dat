5|$|In 2016, two genetic {{studies of}} North American gray wolves {{found that they}} formed six {{ecotypes}} – genetically and ecologically distinct populations separated from other populations by their different type <b>of</b> <b>habitat.</b> These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables. These findings were in accord with previous studies that precipitation influenced morphology and that vegetation and habitat type influenced wolf differences. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's preference {{to remain in the}} type <b>of</b> <b>habitat</b> that it was born into.|$|E

5|$|A {{desert is}} not the kind <b>of</b> <b>habitat</b> that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E
5|$|A key {{stress on}} both {{freshwater}} and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water pollution, {{the building of}} dams, removal of water for use by humans, {{and the introduction of}} exotic species. An example of a fish that has become endangered because <b>of</b> <b>habitat</b> change is the pallid sturgeon, a North American freshwater fish that lives in rivers damaged by human activity.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the National Audubon Society has found that populations of some the most common birds in North America have {{plummeted}} since 1967, with some species showing a decline of 80 percent. The {{study also found that}} California species were particularly affected, with population declines of 75 to 96 percent for several species, including the northern pintail, horned lark and loggerhead shrike. The decline may be due to loss <b>of</b> <b>habitat</b> to urban sprawl, especially grasslands, forests and wetlands, energy development and industrialized agriculture. Climate change could compound losses in the future.|$|E

5|$|Abundant {{in eastern}} Australia, M. nigrocincta ants prefer {{temperate}} bushlands, {{and are usually}} located in dry to semi-dry forests and sclerophyll woodlands.

5|$|Although early humans {{gathered}} uncultivated {{plant materials}} {{for food and}} employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing, most modern human use of plants is through agriculture.

5|$|American kestrels in Canada and the {{northern}} United States typically migrate south in the winter, sometimes going as far as Central America and the Caribbean. Birds that breed south of about 35° north latitude are usually year-round residents. Migration also depends on local weather conditions. Wintering kestrels' choice <b>of</b> <b>habitat</b> varies by sex. Females are found in open areas more often than males during the non-breeding season. A common explanation for this behavior is that the larger females arrive at the preferred habitat first and exclude males from their territory.|$|E

5|$|B.brownii occurs {{naturally}} only in two population clusters between Albany and the Stirling Range {{in southwest}} Western Australia. In the Stirling Range it occurs among heath on rocky mountain slopes; further south it occurs among jarrah woodland in shallow nutrient-poor sand.

Other threats include loss <b>of</b> <b>habitat,</b> commercial exploitation and changes to the fire regime.|$|E

5|$|Destruction and {{encroachment}} <b>of</b> <b>habitat</b> {{by humans}} is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, {{forcing them to}} nest closer to the surf. Urbanization often leads to the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles {{at or near the}} surface.|$|E

5|$|Globally, pelican {{populations are}} {{adversely}} affected by four main factors: declining supplies of fish through overfishing or water pollution, destruction <b>of</b> <b>habitat,</b> direct effects of human activity such as disturbance at nesting colonies, hunting and culling, entanglement in fishing lines and hooks, and lastly the presence of pollutants such as DDT and endrin. Most species' populations {{are more or less}} stable, although three are classified by the IUCN as being at risk. All species breed readily in zoos, which is potentially useful for conservation management.|$|E
5|$|Grevillea juniperina, {{commonly}} known as juniper- or juniper-leaf grevillea or prickly spider-flower, is a plant of the family Proteaceae native to eastern New South Wales and south-eastern Queensland in Australia.
