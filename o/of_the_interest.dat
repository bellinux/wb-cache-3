5|$|Conventional {{sequencing}} {{begins with}} a culture of identical cells {{as a source of}} DNA. However, early metagenomic studies revealed that there are probably large groups of microorganisms in many environments that cannot be cultured and thus cannot be sequenced. These early studies focused on 16S ribosomal RNA sequences which are relatively short, often conserved within a species, and generally different between species. Many 16S rRNA sequences have been found which do not belong to any known cultured species, indicating that there are numerous non-isolated organisms. These surveys of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes taken directly from the environment revealed that cultivation based methods find less than 1% of the bacterial and archaeal species in a sample. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> in metagenomics comes from these discoveries that showed {{that the vast majority of}} microorganisms had previously gone unnoticed.|$|E
5|$|Corder {{was taken}} back to Suffolk where he was tried at Shire Hall, Bury St Edmunds. The trial started on 7 August 1828, having been put back several days because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> which the case had generated. The hotels in Bury St Edmunds began to fill up from as early as 21 July, and {{admittance}} to the court was by ticket {{only because of the}} large numbers who wanted to view the trial. Despite this, the judge and court officials still had to push their way bodily through the crowds that had gathered around the door.|$|E
5|$|In January 1937, Voorhis's first {{legislative}} initiative was {{to propose a}} dramatic increase in spending for the Works Progress Administration in order to increase employment. While this effort was unsuccessful, Congress, faced with an economic downturn the following year, increased WPA spending beyond the level which Voorhis had sought. While the 75th Congress had in excess of 300Democrats, many of them were conservative, and Voorhis emerged as a leader of a progressive caucus of some 50 representatives. Voorhis advocated the purchase by the Federal Government of the stock in the Federal Reserve Banks, which was held by the member banks, as a way of financing government expenditures and briefly got President Roosevelt to support the measure until the President's advisers caused Roosevelt to change his mind. Voorhis later allied with future House Banking Committee chairman Wright Patman to force Federal Reserve Banks to pay most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> they earned on federal securities to the U.S. Government, rather than to the bank stockholders.|$|E

5|$|In a {{marathon}} meeting on 20/21 February 2012 the Eurogroup {{agreed with the}} IMF and the Institute of International Finance on the final conditions of the second bailout package worth €130 billion. The lenders agreed to increase the nominal haircut from 50% to 53.5%. EU Member States agreed to an additional retroactive lowering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> rates of the Greek Loan Facility {{to a level of}} just 150 basis points above Euribor. Furthermore, governments of Member States where central banks currently hold Greek government bonds in their investment portfolio commit to pass on to Greece an amount equal to any future income until 2020. Altogether this should bring down Greece's debt to between 117% and 120.5% of GDP by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Maeda {{was born}} in Funazawa Village, Hirosaki City, Aomori Prefecture, Japan, on November 18, 1878. He {{attended}} Kenritsu Itiu high school (currently Hirokou—a Hirosaki school). As a child, {{he was known as}} Hideyo. He practiced sumo as a teenager, but lacked the ideal build for the sport. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> generated by stories about the success of judo at contests between judo and jujutsu that were occurring at the time, he changed from sumo to judo. In 1894, at seventeen years of age, his parents sent him to Tokyo to enroll in Waseda University. He took up Kodokan judo the following year.|$|E
5|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> in the 1886 season {{concerned}} the newly inaugurated Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July, which offered a then record prize of £10,000. From {{the start of}} the year, St. Gatien was seen as one of the leading contenders for the new race together with Bendigo and Minting. For the second year in succession, St. Gatien's spring preparation was disrupted, this time by injury, although he was able to resume his training in time for Royal Ascot. It was reported that St. Gatien had been defeated by Melton in a private trial race in early 1886, but there are few details and it is unclear whether or not this was a serious contest.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{article is}} to {{substantiate}} a comprehensive analytical system for evaluating <b>the</b> realization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> PPP parties as a methodological support for diagnosing problems in development of partnership relations {{between the state and}} business. <b>The</b> current state <b>of</b> establishing PPPs in Ukraine indicates that <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PPP concept without taking into account <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> all parties in such agreement does not create favorable conditions for its development and implementation <b>of</b> priorities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state economic policy. To identify <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> PPP parties and adequately evaluate <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> their realization, it is necessary to use appropriate analytical tools. In <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> this study it is justified that at building the analytical system for evaluating <b>the</b> realization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> PPP parties, <b>the</b> totality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> should be viewed as an ontological complex comprising <b>the</b> subsystem <b>of</b> public sector partners’ <b>interests,</b> on <b>the</b> one hand, and <b>the</b> subsystem <b>of</b> private partners’ <b>interests,</b> on <b>the</b> other; the indicators describing <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> PPP parties are systematized: four groups are singled out (partial, indirect, analytical and integral), the relationships between them are described, which allows selecting the relevant and most informative indicators for the evaluation avoiding duplication of indicators at building integral indicators; there proposed an approach to <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> a system of partial indicators for <b>the</b> comprehensive evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> PPP parties, according to which a system of evaluation indicators is developed to diagnose <b>the</b> problems <b>of</b> realizing <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> partners at the macro-level; there developed recommendations on quantitative evaluation <b>of</b> consistency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> PPP parties with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> integral indicator <b>of</b> consistency of interests of PPP parties and analytical indicators that allow quantifying the financial contradictions that objectively arise between public and private partners.

5|$|The tax was {{rescinded}} by the British in 1812, {{who then}} imposed a British style constitution on the island. One legal innovation {{of this time}} of particular consequence for the aristocracy was that creditors, who had previously only been able to enforce repayments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> on a loan or mortgage, could now seize property. Property began to change hands in smaller parcels at auctions, and consequently a land-owning bourgeoisie immediately began to flourish. Revolts against the Bourbons in 1821, and 1848 divided the nobility, and liberalism was in the air. These factors coupled with {{the social and political}} upheaval of the following Risorgimento in the 19th century meant the Sicilian aristocracy was a doomed class. Furthermore, because of their neglect and dereliction of noblesse oblige, an essential element of the feudal system, the countryside was often ruled by bandits outside the enclosed villages, and the once grand country villas were decaying. The building mania of the Sicilian upper class was over.|$|E

In 2005, PAC began manufacturing JF-17 components; production of sub-assemblies commenced on 22 January 2008. The PAF was to receive a further six pre-production aircraft in 2005, for a total of 8 out of an initial production run of 16 aircraft. Initial operating capability was to be achieved by the end of 2008. Final assembly of the JF-17 in Pakistan began on 30 June 2009; PAC expected to complete production of four to six aircraft that year. They planned to produce twelve aircraft in 2010 and fifteen to sixteen aircraft per year from 2011; this could increase to twenty-five aircraft per year. On December 29, 2015, Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) announced the rollout of 16th JF-17 Thunder fighter manufactured in the calendar year 2015, taking total number of manufactured aircraft to more than 66. Later, a PAF spokesperson said that in light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> shown by various countries, it has been decided that production capacity of JF-17 Thunder at PAC Kamra will be expanded.|$|E
