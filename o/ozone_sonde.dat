40|$|Interactive {{comment on}} “Impact of {{sampling}} frequency {{in the analysis}} of tropospheric ozone observations ” by M. Saunois et al. Anonymous Referee # 1 Received and published: 13 November 2011 The authors present a novel approach, based on reducing the sampling frequency of MOZAIC profiles over some airports, to quantify the uncertainty caused by the low fre-quency of some tropospheric ozone datasets (e. g. <b>ozone</b> <b>sondes,</b> with typical frequen-cies of 4 to 12 profiles a month). They show that such low frequency measurements seem to be sufficient to distinguish the seasonal cycle, but may mask the intra-seasonal and interannual variability in the tropospheric ozone concentrations as well as affect the calculation of long-term trends. The uncertainties they calculate are particularly high for the lowest frequency datasets (4 -days a month) and tend to minimise in the free troposphere. The manuscript is rather technical, but the results have important impli-cations regarding the use of low frequency ozone data sets such as <b>ozone</b> <b>sondes</b> for model evaluation as well as for analyses of variability in tropospheric ozone at different time scales.

A comparison of the modeled ozone with a passive ozone tracer and <b>ozone</b> <b>sonde</b> observations at Ny-Alesund shows {{that by the end}} of March 2000 about 2. 5 ppmv of ozone are chemically depleted in the lower stratosphere, corresponding to more than 70 % ozone loss. At the same time, the inferred loss in total ozone inside or at the edge of the polar vortex is between 90 and 140 DU.

The spatial coverage of the IASI instrument allows sampling of effectively the same air mass with several IASI scenes simultaneously. Comparisons of the root-mean-square of an ensemble of IASI profiles to theoretical errors indicate that the measurement noise and the interference of temperature and water vapour on the retrieval together mostly explain the empirically derived random errors. The total degrees of freedom for signal of the retrieval for ozone are 3. 1 +/- 0. 2 and the tropospheric degrees of freedom are 1. 0 +/- 0. 2 for the described cases.

Comparison of assimilated ozone with <b>ozone</b> <b>sonde</b> and MOZAIC data indicate an agreement within 10 % in the lower stratosphere, where dynamical processes dominate.

40|$|The {{importance}} of ozone in the chemistry and the radiative {{balance of the}} atmosphere is well established. Several ground and satellite based methods are available for measuring total column or the vertical distribution of ozone. The most common ground based instruments that measure ozone are the Dobson and the Brewer instruments, while <b>ozone</b> <b>sondes</b> measure vertical distribution of ozone. There are six Dobson instruments located in Australia, and <b>ozone</b> <b>sondes</b> are launched from one location (Laverton, Victoria). Solar atmospheric spectroscopy is an established technique to measure the total column amounts of trace atmospheric gases and aerosols. Ozone has a rich spectrum extending from the far ultraviolet to the microwave region. At Wollongong University a high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (HR-FTIR), a diode array ultraviolet spectrometer and a diode array visible spectrometer have been coupled to the same solar tracker to ensure all three instruments are viewing the same atmospheric column. One aim of this thesis {{is to develop a}} rugged, reliable inexpensive solar ultraviolet and visible spectrometer system, suitable to determine total column atmospheric ozone, based on the diode array spectrometer. The shape of the absorption features of the infrared spectrum is influenced by the temperature and pressure environment of the absorbing molecule, and therefore potentially contains information on the vertical distribution of the absorbing molecule. In contrast, in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the spectrum, the environment of the absorbing molecules has limited influence on the shape of the absorption features, and there is greater potential for retrieving accurate total column atmospheric ozone. The thesis also aims to develop the techniques required to determine total column atmospheric ozone from ground based solar high resolution FTIR, and to assess if the complementary information available from solar infrared, ultraviolet and visible spectra can be used to determine some vertical information on atmospheric ozone. The analysis algorithm requires some prior knowledge of the pressure-temperature and ozone vertical profile.

Meteorological data, weather charts, ice charts as well as trajectory calculations have been considered for this analysis. Altogether eight events of surface ozone minima were recorded, four of them from June to August 1992 and another four in the period from August to September in 1993, respectively. The duration of these low ozone events was about 1 - 2 days.
