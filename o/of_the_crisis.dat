5|$|The Crisis {{caused the}} newly {{independent}} African states to reconsider their allegiances and internal ties. In particular, {{it led to the}} division of African states into factions.

The chaotic violence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> and the fate of the country's whites, many of whom entered Northern and Southern Rhodesia as refugees, contributed to the widespread belief among whites there that black nationalist politicians were not ready to govern, and prompted fears that immediate majority rule in Rhodesia might lead to a similar situation.

5|$|The Quebra Quilo riots were {{suspected}} of being condoned by priests, and together with the arrest of the bishops, {{drew attention to the}} Imperial government having become embroiled in a no-win dispute. The crisis would only be smoothed over by the replacement of the Cabinet in September 1875 and the Emperor's reluctant grant of a full amnesty to the bishops. Historian Heitor Lyra blamed Rio Branco and his Cabinet, both bishops and, primarily, PedroII for the ordeal. All parties involved revealed a lack of tact, and their intransigence only caused harm—mostly to the monarchy itself. The main consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> was that the clergy no longer saw any benefit in upholding PedroII.

5|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{had a serious}} negative impact on the Icelandic economy. The national currency fell sharply in value, foreign currency transactions were virtually suspended for weeks, and the market capitalisation of the Icelandic stock exchange fell by more than 90%. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis,</b> Iceland underwent a severe economic depression; the country's gross domestic product dropped by 10% in real terms between the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2010. A new era with positive GDP growth started in 2011, and has helped foster a gradually declining trend for the unemployment rate. The government budget deficit has declined from 9.7% of GDP in 2009 and 2010 to 0.2% of GDP in 2014; the central government gross debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline to less than 60% in 2018 from a maximum of 85% in 2011.|$|E
