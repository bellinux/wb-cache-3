60|$|The Little White Lady now resumed {{her daily}} {{walks in the}} Monk's Garden, and her <b>occasional</b> <b>seat</b> {{at the foot of}} the monument; she was shy and diffident, however, and evidently fearful of intruding. If any persons were walking in the garden she would avoid them, and seek the most remote parts; and was seen like a sprite, only by gleams and glimpses, as she glided among the groves and thickets. Many of her {{feelings}} and fancies, during these lonely rambles, were embodied in verse, noted down on her tablet, and transferred to paper in the evening on her return to the farmhouse. Some of these verses now lie before me, written with considerable harmony of versification, but chiefly curious as being illustrative of that singular and enthusiastic idolatry with which she almost worshipped the genius of Byron, or rather, the romantic image of him formed by her imagination.|$|E
50|$|The first Xtra was {{a single}} seater (monocar) with a light plywood on ash frame body with an <b>occasional</b> <b>seat</b> behind the driver {{on top of the}} engine. It {{featured}} acetylene lighting. A top speed of above 30 mph (48 km/h) was claimed.|$|E
50|$|Each {{body has}} four instead of three doors. The rear seats are wider {{incorporating}} the space above the wheel arches, the mudguards built {{closer to the}} wheels to reduce mud splashing. The saloon landaulette's solo <b>occasional</b> <b>seat</b> is now a pair and they fold into the partition below the glass division.|$|E

50|$|Nether Langwith {{was home}} to Major Samuel William Welfitt, who was a colonel and a landowner. Based on the 1861 Census, he lived at Langwith Lodge {{alongside}} his wife, his mother-in-law and seven servants. Langwith Lodge was formerly an <b>occasional</b> <b>seat</b> of Earl Bathurst, but nowadays is a nursing home.|$|E
50|$|Rambouillet lies on {{the edge}} of the vast Forest of Rambouillet (Forêt de Rambouillet or Forêt de l'Yveline), and is famous for its {{historical}} castle, the Château de Rambouillet, which hosted several international summits. Due to its proximity to Paris and Versailles, Rambouillet has long been an <b>occasional</b> <b>seat</b> of government.|$|E
50|$|In the 17th century Derby House, an <b>occasional</b> <b>seat</b> of the Minshull family, covered most of {{the grounds}} covered by present-day Rock Ferry. Thomas Oakshott, Mayor of Liverpool, lived there in the 19th century. The house, located on Rock Lane West close to the New Chester Road, was {{demolished}} in the early 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|The Regina, DF400 and DK400 chassis was {{generally}} equipped with steel limousine bodywork by Carbodies (identified as DK400B) with a drop division, three <b>occasional</b> <b>seats</b> and more luxurious trim {{in the rear}} compartment than in the DK400A owner-driver car.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, a major {{redesign}} saw the wheelbase lengthened, redesigned bodywork with a fixed {{windshield and}} two <b>occasional</b> <b>seats</b> added (which in 1958 became an option {{with the introduction}} of the two-seat BN6 produced in parallel with the 2+2 BN4), and the powertrain completely replaced by one based on the six-cylinder BMC C-Series engine.|$|R
50|$|From 1991 on, 99 {{units of}} the Touring Limousine with 24 in {{wheelbase}} extension were produced. The car was lengthened at the C-pillar with an opera window added, in a style reminiscent of Rolls-Royce's Phantom V and Phantom VI models. Like these earlier models, most of the cars had fold-down <b>occasional</b> <b>seats</b> in the rear passenger area.|$|R
50|$|The Maya had a {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{with wooden}} stringers and Wobex mat covering. The cabin stood above the rear fuselage line, enclosing side-by-side seats with a third, <b>occasional</b> <b>seat,</b> or luggage space, behind. In front a 75 kW (100 hp) Lycoming flat four engine, with cylinder-heads exposed, drove a two blade propeller. It had a conventional undercarriage, with each mainwheel mounted on V-struts and half axles hinged to the fuselage central underside via rubber shock absorbers. The fixed tailwheel was steerable.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{has a low}} 8.2 : 1 {{compression}} ratio, {{allowing it}} to run on low-octane gasoline. The four-wheel drive is engaged by a lever on the floor, as are the optional differential locks. The car has rack-and-pinion steering and many suspension parts are the same at all four corners. The interior is minimal, although the seats, from the contemporary Volkswagen Passat, were considered surprisingly comfortable by period observers. The tiny back seat has two individually folding seat backs, but can be considered mainly an <b>occasional</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In Black's Guide to Nottinghamshire, 1876, it is noted, [...] "The Hall, {{a spacious}} modern mansion, {{is now the}} <b>occasional</b> <b>seat</b> of Count De Pully, who {{inherited}} the estate from the late William Fletcher Norton Norton, Esq. The villagers have a tradition, that during the civil wars {{of the seventeenth century}} a battle was fought in the fields near Elton, and in confirmation of this report, several weapons and human remains have been found. In 1780, a large number of silver coins, principally of the reign of Henry II., were discovered in the churchyard." ...|$|E
50|$|The 100-6 {{featured}} a 2 in longer wheelbase than the 100, {{a more powerful}} straight-six engine in place of its slightly larger inline-four, and added two <b>occasional</b> <b>seats</b> (which later became optional). The body lines were slightly streamlined, a smaller, wider radiator grille placed lower, an air scoop {{was added to the}} bonnet, and the windscreen fixed.|$|R
50|$|As {{before as}} well as the saloons {{described}} above a sports saloon, a foursome drophead coupé and a five-seater (open) tourer are available Again the Seven Seater has a longer wheelbase and may be purchased as a saloon, limousine or landaulette. All three have a pair of <b>occasional</b> <b>seats</b> in the rear compartment, the limousine is an ideal mourning carriage.|$|R
50|$|In July 1958 the {{prototype}} of a new taxi designed by Mann & Overton was displayed to the London Press. Its new body had four conventional doors and the luggage beside the driver was now fully enclosed. The <b>occasional</b> <b>seats</b> had been made more comfortable with a sloping backrest and switches provided for a heater and an extra bright light.|$|R
5000|$|From 100 AD onwards {{control of}} the area changed hands several times between {{different}} [...] "tribes" [...] (Suevi, Marcomanni, Allemanni, Burgundians), before the area {{was taken by the}} Franks in the 6th century. Würzburg became the <b>occasional</b> <b>seat</b> of a Franconian-Thuringian duke under the Merovingians. His court resided on the right bank of the Main, however. In the 7th century, a written document mentioned Uburzi (which later became Virteburch and then [...] "Würzburg"), referring to the fortification on the hill. The name Marienberg was in use only from high medieval times onward. After missionary work in the area led by Saint Kilian in the late 7th century, in the early 8th century, the Franks under Duke Hedan II constructed a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary and a fortification (earth ramparts and half-timbered houses) on the hill. The chapel - probably built at the site of a former pagan holy site dedicated to some mother goddess - and later churches that replaced it, was the reason why eventually hill and fortress became known as Marienberg ("Mary's Mount"). This likely was the first Christian church built of stone north of the Alps outside of the territory formerly controlled by Rome (i.e. east of the Rhine and {{on the far side of}} the Limes).|$|E
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the {{limousine}} was that the <b>occasional</b> middle <b>seats</b> were three abreast.|$|R
5000|$|British Leyland's [...] "Daimler DS420" [...] was {{announced}} in June 1968. Taller than the 420G the new car was nearly nineteen feet long and six feet six inches wide with [...] "majestic proportions". The rear compartment carried six people in comfort on the rear seats and three fold-away <b>occasional</b> <b>seats.</b> Sir William Lyons pointed out {{it was less than}} half the price of any of its competitors.|$|R
5000|$|Additional <b>occasional</b> <b>seating</b> {{appeared}} in the latter centuries of evolution of the coach and carriage. The 1865 edition of Webster's An American Dictionary of the English Language defines a rumble as [...] "A boot with a seat above it for servants, behind a carriage." [...] Similar to the rumble on European phaetons was the spider, a small single seat or bench on spindly supports for seating a groom or footman.|$|R
50|$|There is a four-door six-light saloon body or a two-door coupé with a dome head, <b>occasional</b> <b>seats</b> in the {{interior}} and a dickey seat behind. Both cars have bucket front seats that are adjustable. In early 1929 these bodies were joined by a Club Coupé by Gordon England. The Club Coupé cost ten {{percent more than the}} ordinary coupé but it included wire wheels and reinforced (Triplex) glass.|$|R
500|$|... "The moor of Kersal was in {{the time}} of the Romans, perhaps in that of the Britons before them, and for many ages after both, a thicket of oaks and a pasture for hogs; and the little knolls, that so remarkably diversify the plain, and are {{annually}} covered with mingled crowds rising in ranks over ranks to the top, were once the <b>occasional</b> <b>seats</b> of the herdsmen that superintended these droves into the woods." ...|$|R
50|$|Although the car {{was usually}} {{supplied}} as an open two-seater, an <b>occasional</b> rear <b>seat</b> and bolt-on steel hard top were available as extras.|$|R
50|$|The Austin FL2 Hire Car was the {{limousine}} {{version of the}} FX4. Introduced {{at the same time}} as the FX4, it was aimed at the private hire, limousine and funeral trade and this market was the main reason why the petrol engine was offered in the vehicle. It had forward-facing <b>occasional</b> <b>seats,</b> a second front seat and carried no roof sign. It could also be ordered with special trim at extra cost. It was also the base of a few hearses.|$|R
50|$|Opéra coupé: A coupé de-ville {{with a high}} roofed {{passenger}} compartment such that the owners could be driven to the opera without the need to remove their large hats. These often had <b>occasional</b> <b>seats</b> that folded for use by children or extra passengers, and allowed easy passage to the rear seats. These cars most closely approximated a motorized version of the original horse-drawn coupé. Often, they would have solid rear-quarter panels, with small, circular windows, to enable the occupants to see out without being seen. These opera windows were revived on many U.S. automobiles during the 1970s and early 1980s.|$|R
50|$|A new and roomy seven-seater {{which has}} much to {{recommend}} it including the price. Unusually good windows, long and fairly deep give a good view and enhance {{the appearance of the}} car. The cushions and shaped squabs are comfortable, the compartments are divided by sliding glass panels. There are folding foot rests, blinds to the division window, shaped armchair backs to the seat and a double arm rest in the centre. The <b>occasional</b> <b>seats</b> give reasonable comfort, the doorways behind are wide, the boot has two good-sized fitted suitcases with the spare wheel below and its platform is designed to take 1½ cwt 168 lb of extra luggage.|$|R
50|$|Vignale {{was then}} chosen {{to build a}} {{cabriolet}} version of the Appia. The Lancia Appia Convertibile, designed by Giovanni Michelotti, was introduced at the 1957 Turin Motor Show and built up to 1962. Initially a two-seater, it was later revised to accept two rear <b>occasional</b> <b>seats,</b> thus becoming a 2+2 from the summer of 1968. All Convertibles were built on a 812.01 chassis; at first based on the second series Appia platform with a 53 PS engine, upgraded in 1959 to the third series platform and 54 PS engine, and finally in 1960 to the more powerful 60 PS engine. From 1957 to 1962 1,584 convertibles were built.|$|R

5000|$|A Hire Car version, the FL1 {{was also}} made, which had four full doors, a bench front seat, column gear-change and an umbrella-type {{handbrake}} handle. The two <b>occasional</b> <b>seats</b> faced forward. A 'driveaway' chassis-cab was also supplied to outside coachbuilders. Several shooting brake ('woodie' [...] ) bodies were made, {{as well as}} newspaper vans for the three London evening papers, the Star, News and Standard. A number of hearse bodies were also mounted on FL1 chassis by such coachbuilders as Simpson and Slater, Alpe and Saunders, Arthur Mulliner and Woodall Nicholson. Undoubtedly the most remarkable body built on an FX3 chassis belonged to Armenian oil magnate Nubar Gulbenkian. Built by London coachbuilders FLM Panelcraft, it was an open-drive town car, with carriage lamps and wickerwork decoration on the body sides. It was powered by a Ford six cylinder engine.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is {{structural}} design and subsequent realisation of variable bed furniture for a specific customer. The concept of the product and its technical parameters were based on studies of functional and minimalistic housing designs, literary sources about bed and seating furniture, market research of space-saving beds and standards related to bed and seating furniture. The customer has been given three variants to choose. The final solution is creation of a sliding bed on wheels with linear leading. The bed is shifting through {{the gap in the}} wall into built-in closet area hiding in the spare space behing this wall. Third of the bed room remains in the bedroom, which, together with backrest creates a sofa for <b>occasional</b> <b>seating.</b> Thesis attachement consists of the bill of materials and construction drawings of the product. It has been created as a innovative concept of space-saving bed and the realisation fulfilled the requirements of the customer...|$|R
