5000|$|Chord progressions may be {{constructed}} with borrowed chords, including two progressions common in rock music, I-VII-VI-VII, common everywhere, and I-VI-IV, {{used a lot}} by bands including Genesis, Yes and Nirvana. VII is from Mixolydian and VI is found in both Aeolian and Phrygian. The VII-I cadence with VII substituting for V is common, as well as II-I, III-I, and VI-I. In popular music, <b>the</b> major triad <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowered</b> third scale degree (III), <b>the</b> major triad <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowered</b> sixth scale degree (VI) and <b>the</b> major triad <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowered</b> seventh scale degree, or [...] "flat seven" [...] (VII) are common.

5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built four {{dams and}} locks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> Snake River to {{facilitate}} shipping. The lower Columbia River has likewise been dammed for navigation. Thus a deep shipping channel through locks and slackwater reservoirs for heavy barges exists from the Pacific Ocean to Lewiston, Idaho. Most barge traffic originating on the Snake River goes to deep-water ports <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> Columbia River, such as Portland. Grain, mostly wheat, {{is the main}} product shipped from the Snake, and nearly {{all of it is}} exported internationally from the lower Columbia River ports.|$|E
5|$|In the female, the pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the {{chelicera}} (mouthpart), is serrate, not {{smooth as}} in A.gymnuromys. The idiosoma (main {{part of the}} body) is 630 to 670μm long and 370 to 435μm wide and the dorsal shield (covering the upper side) is 620 to 655μm long and 360 to 370μm wide. The dorsal setae (bristles) are long relative to A.gymnuromys. The sternal shield (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> {{side of the body}}) is 115 to 125μm long and 184 to 200μm wide and is more ornamented than in A.gymnuromys. Unlike A.eliurus, A.voalavo lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between the lyrifissures (sensory organs) iv1 and iv2 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> side of the body. The other shields <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> side of the body are the genitoventral shield (232 to 253 by 170 to 182μm), the peritrematic shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm), and the anal shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm). On the soft part of the cuticle, there are nine pairs of setae. The first segments of the legs, the coxae, lack hooks. On the coxae of the third pair of legs, the setae at the back are spur-like.|$|E

5|$|As more carcharodontosaurids were discovered, their interrelationships became clearer. The {{group was}} defined as all allosauroids closer to Carcharodontosaurus than Allosaurus or Sinraptor by Thomas R. Holtz and colleagues in 2004. In 2006, Coria and Currie united Giganotosaurus and Mapusaurus in the carcharodontosaurid {{subfamily}} Giganotosaurinae based on shared features of the femur, such as a weak fourth trocanther, and a shallow, broad groove <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> end. In 2008, Sereno and Stephen L. Brusatte united Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus, and Tyrannotitan in the tribe Giganotosaurini.

5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform.

The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E
