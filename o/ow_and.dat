[...] Universes first issue appeared in June 1953, while Other Worlds was still being published. [...] It was financed by Palmer's partner, and intended as a bimonthly, though in fact the first four issues were on a quarterly schedule.

The ow-valve provides an incentive for end-to-end congestion control to keep the packet drop rate low under moderate congestion, and to conserva-tively back o under heavy congestion. Our simulation results demonstrate that the ow-valve can eectively protect the network from misbehaving <b>ows</b> <b>and,</b> at the same time, isolate un-desirable behavior of conformant TCP.

50|$|The vowel {{system of}} Secular Nacireman {{consists}} of nine phonemically distinct vowels distinguished {{on the basis}} of three degrees of tongue height and three degrees of tongue advancement.... There can be no question as to the validity of these nine vocalic phonemes, for each is attested by a number of minimal pairs elicited independently from several informants. Curiously enough, however, most informants insist that only five vowels exist in the language: these are called ?ey, ?iy, ?ay, ?<b>ow,</b> <b>and</b> yuw, and are invariably cited in precisely that order.... The discovery of the widespread myth of the five-vowel system prompted the present writer to conduct a series of intensive interviews and administer questionnaires to a sample of Nacireman informants with a view to mapping the general outlines of Nacireman folk linguistics. This research strategy ultimately provided compelling evidence that it is the ti'yˆcir caste that has disseminated the notion of the five-vowel system.|$|E
