40|$|As {{someone who}} used to work as a {{pharmacist}} within the National Health Service, I was very interested in attending this conference. I have always felt that <b>Occupational</b> <b>Psychologists</b> could make a huge impact in the NHS in a broad range of areas, from personnel selection and retention, through training design and theory, to human factors – such as designing out risk and error. Another reason for wanting to attend is that, currently working for Jobcentre Plus in the field of employment and disability, I am increasingly making links with healthcare professionals such as GPs, occupational therapists and head injury rehabilitation teams. This is in part because of an increasing focus towards helping people on Incapacity Benefit return to work. Background of delegates About twenty delegates attended. Roughly half were non-psychologists from human resources departments of NHS Trusts; the remainder included independent <b>Occupational</b> <b>Psychologists,</b> one employed by a NHS Trust, researchers in business schools and occupational psychology departments, a delegate from QinetiQ (formerly part of the MoD) and two from the Department for Work an...|$|R

5000|$|Since the {{beginnings}} of organizational development as a profession, diagnosis has moved from the purely behavioral towards a strategic and holistic business diagnostic approach, and from looking at human interventions in isolation to exploring the interactions {{of people in the}} context in which they operate.

50|$|With {{regards to}} {{assessing}} applicants for an employment position, psychometric numerical reasoning tests {{have been created}} by <b>occupational</b> <b>psychologists,</b> {{who are involved in}} the study of numeracy. These psychometric numerical reasoning tests are used to assess an applicants' ability to comprehend and apply numbers. These tests are sometimes administered with a time limit, resulting in the need for the test-taker to think quickly and concisely. Research has shown that these tests are very useful in evaluating potential applicants because they do not allow the applicants to prepare for the test, unlike interview questions. This suggests that an applicant's results are reliable and accurate.|$|R

50|$|An {{additional}} possible {{contributing factor}} {{identified by the}} investigation was the captain's psychological traits.

50|$|Assessment day {{is usually}} {{organised}} {{by the human}} resource department of the organisation. There might be other managers of the company in the assessors panel to provide technical input. Larger organisations sometimes also hire or invites their <b>occupational</b> <b>psychologists</b> on the panel to provide professional reviews on the candidate's behaviour. Occasionally, if an assessment day involves role play exercises, some companies bring professional actors to play that part to assess the behaviour of candidates. For example, {{to play a role}} of a dissatisfied client. The idea behind this is to create a real life scenario. Some candidates often prefer this idea and find it easier to behave in the way as they would do in real life. Ultimately, the purpose of employers having an assessment day is to measure that how well candidates will deal with a situation that they might encounter in the job.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the concept of work instability (a mis-match between an individual's functional and cognitive abilities and the demands of their job) following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and develop a work instability scale specific to this population. Method: Work instability (WI) following TBI was explored through qualitative interviews which were then used to generate items for a work instability scale (WIS). Rasch analysis was used to examine the scaling properties of the TBI-WIS which was then validated against a gold standard of expert vocational assessment by <b>occupational</b> <b>psychologists.</b> Results and conclusion: The resulting measure is a 36 item, self-administered scale which can be scored in three bands indicating low, medium and high risk of job retention problems. The scale meets modern psychometric requirements for measurement and presents an opportunity in routine clinical practice to take positive action to prevent job loss...|$|R
