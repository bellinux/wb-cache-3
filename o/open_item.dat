40|$|The Disposal Criticality Analysis Methodology Topical Report'' prescribes an {{approach}} to the methodology for performing postclosure criticality analyses within the monitored geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. An essential component of the methodology is the ''Configuration Generator Model for In-Package Criticality'' that provides a tool to evaluate the probabilities of degraded configurations achieving a critical state. The configuration generator model is a risk-informed, performance-based process for evaluating the criticality potential of degraded configurations in the monitored geologic repository. The method uses event tree methods to define configuration classes derived from criticality scenarios and to identify configuration class characteristics (parameters, ranges, etc.). The probabilities of achieving the various configuration classes are derived in part from probability density functions for degradation parameters. The NRC has issued ''Safety Evaluation Report for Disposal Criticality Analysis Methodology Topical Report, Revision 0 ''. That report contained 28 <b>open</b> <b>items</b> that required resolution through additional documentation.

The applicant provided a proposed supplement to the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR Supplement) in Appendix A to the LRA, in accordance with 10 CFR 54. 21 (d). The purpose of the proposed FSAR supplement is to provide an appropriate description of the programs and activities for managing the effects of aging and the evaluation of time-limited aging analyses (TLAAs), so that any future changes to the programs or activities that may affect their effectiveness will be controlled under 10 CFR 50. 59. By letter dated July 28, 2000, the staff issued RAIs related to Appendix A to the LRA. In response, by letter dated October 10, 2000, the applicant provided Appendix B to the LRA, which addressed many of the RAIs related to Appendix A of the LRA. The staff issued <b>Open</b> <b>Item</b> 3. 0 - 1 {{to ensure that the}} applicant's FSAR Supplement contained an adequate description of the programs and activities that have been credited for managing the effects of aging, and the evaluation of time-limited aging analyses (TLAAs) for the period of extended operation as required by 10 CFR 54. 21 (d). The staff reviewed the aging management program and TLAA descriptions provided by letter dated October 10, 2000, and the associated FSAR Supplement provided by letter dated September 5, 2001, and found that the FSAR Supplement provided by the applicant contains descriptions of these programs and activities adequate to satisfy 10 CFR Part 54 requirements. On the basis of the program descriptions provided by the applicant, the staff concludes that the FSAR Supplement contains sufficient information to adequately describe the content of the associated aging management programs and TLAAs and satisfies the requirements of 10 CFR 54. 21 (d).
