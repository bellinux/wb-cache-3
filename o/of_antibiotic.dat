Therefore the inappropriate use <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> is getting a global problem, mainly in the developing countries. Emergence <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> resistance is often a result of irrational prescribing patterns, misuse <b>of</b> the <b>antibiotics</b> as well as self-medication. Although the United Arab Emirates (UAE]) antimicrobial policy restricts dispensing <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> without prescription, studies revealed the wide availability of these agents over the counter (OTC), their over prescribing pattern and the high prevalence <b>of</b> self-medication with <b>antibiotics,</b> unfortunately and regardless of this results, {{there is a lack}} and paucity in studies that tracking the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> resistance.

40|$|Abstract. The {{photochemical}} degradation <b>of</b> two <b>antibiotics,</b> enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, was preliminarily studied under irradiation with a high-pressure mercury lamp (HMPL) in this paper. The influence of initial concentration <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics,</b> Fe () and platymonas subcordiformis on the degradation efficiency <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> were investigated. The results suggested {{that in the}} presence of P. subcordiformis, the degradation efficiency of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride were 85. 0 % and 84. 2 % in aqueous solutions underwent photodegradation under HMPL irradiation, respectively. Moreover, the lower initial concentration <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> improved photodegradation rate <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics...</b>|$|R
30|$|To compile the use <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> both as {{prophylaxis}} and treatment, {{oral and}} intravenous, in studies regarding pin-site infection {{is important to}} evaluate {{the effect of a}} pin-site care.

5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, especially in the case <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> resistance.|$|E
5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments in favor <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> treatment should be {{balanced by the}} consideration of possible side effects, and {{it is reasonable to}} suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from how common it is.|$|E

30|$|In conclusion, {{our results}} {{demonstrated}} that chlortetracycline, colistin sulfate and zinc bacitracin supplementation have {{the tendency to}} improve the richness and diversity of rex rabbits caecum microorganism. Comparing three antibiotics, colistin sulfate and zinc bacitracin plays a better role than chlortetracycline in the promotion of animal growth and the prevention of disease. This information could guide the reasonable use and avoid the abuse of these three kinds <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> <b>of</b> rex rabbits and serve {{for future studies on}} the design <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> substitute or new nutritional strategies to promote rex rabbits growth and health. There lies a great controversy about the use <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> in animal agriculture. Therefor, we need {{to pay more attention to}} the collateral effects <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> Moreover, it is necessary to further study the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> action on animals.|$|R
5000|$|Per The ICU Book [...] "The {{first rule}} <b>of</b> <b>{{antibiotic}}s</b> is {{try not to}} use them, and the second rule is try not to use too many of them." [...] Inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> {{have contributed to the}} emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Self prescription <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> is an example <b>of</b> misuse. Many <b>antibiotics</b> are frequently prescribed to treat symptoms or diseases that do not respond to antibiotics or that are likely to resolve without treatment. Also, incorrect or suboptimal antibiotics are prescribed for certain bacterial infections. The overuse <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics,</b> like penicillin and erythromycin, has been associated with emerging antibiotic resistance since the 1950s. Widespread usage <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> in hospitals has also been associated with increases in bacterial strains and species that no longer respond to treatment with the most common antibiotics.|$|R
5|$|For {{those with}} {{recurrent}} infections, taking a short course of antibiotics when each infection occurs {{is associated with}} the lowest antibiotic use. A prolonged course of daily antibiotics is also effective. Medications frequently used include nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Methenamine is another agent used for this purpose as in the bladder where the acidity is low it produces formaldehyde to which resistance does not develop. Some recommend against prolonged use due to concerns <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> resistance.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{transfer}} between species {{includes the}} formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria. In medicine, this contributes to the spread <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species. Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean weevil Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which have received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and plants. Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains.|$|E
5|$|Geneticists {{often use}} viruses as vectors to {{introduce}} genes into cells {{that they are}} studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in this approach is increasing, because of the high level <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Development <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> is difficult, whereas many drug discoveries {{have been}} a result of concerted effort and {{intensive}} research and development, antibiotics have seemingly been discovered by chance. Since 1987 {{there have been no}} discoveries or development of a new class <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> This is partly due to the finicky nature <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> As most are produced biosynthetically they require an organism to produce. Historically this has meant that different species are grown and observed for any antimicrobial activity. Not only does this require a culturable species to start off with, but the conditions the species are grown in must be adequate for production <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> as well as having the number <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> produced reach a density threshold so that their function can be observed.|$|R

40|$|Antibiotic therapy {{represents}} one of the most frequently used methods in medical practice, human or veterinary. The efficiency of this therapy is based on an appropriate choose <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics,</b> avoiding also the errors that may occur by their utilization.

5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, transduction, conjugation, {{and transformation}} involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria {{of the same}} species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Many {{treatment}} options for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help. Treatments applied {{directly to the}} affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth {{for the treatment of}} acne. However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> therapy. Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women. Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact to individuals.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{antibiotics}} {{are recommended}} for {{no longer than}} three months as antibiotic courses exceeding this duration {{are associated with the}} development <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter courses. Furthermore, if long-term oral antibiotics beyond three months are thought to be necessary, it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide and/or a retinoid be used {{at the same time to}} limit the risk of P. acnes developing antibiotic resistance. Dapsone is not a first-line topical antibiotic due to higher cost and lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics. Topical dapsone is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to yellow-orange skin discoloration with this combination.|$|E

40|$|Important classes <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> {{that are}} used to treat {{bacterial}} infections in humans are also being used in food-producing animals. The overuse <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> for animal food production is becoming an issue of growing concern as it promotes antibacterial resistance, compromising their efficacy and effectiveness. Low concentrations <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> from feedlot runoff and wastewater discharges have been reported in surface waters and groundwaters used as drinking water sources. The presence <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> in drinking water sources has implications for potable reuse.

5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> {{resistance in}} bacteria is iatrogenic as well. Bacteria strains resistant to antibiotics have evolved {{in response to}} the overprescription <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> drugs.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that sub-therapeutic levels of β-lactam {{antibiotics}} induce biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus. This sub-therapeutic level <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> may result {{from the use of}} antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture, or during the normal course <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> therapy. The biofilm formation induced by low-level methicillin was inhibited by DNase, suggesting that the sub-therapeutic levels <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> also induce extracellular DNA release. Moreover, from an evolutionary point of view, the creation of the tragedy of the commons in pathogenic microbes may provide advanced therapeutic ways for chronic infections caused by biofilms via genetically engineered invasive cheaters who can invade wild-types ‘cooperators’ of pathogenic bacteria until cooperator populations go to extinction or overall population ‘cooperators and cheaters ’ go to extinction.|$|E

40|$|A cross {{sectional}} survey {{was done in}} secondary schools in Dar es Salaam region between April and June 2006 {{with the aim of}} determining misuse <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> among boarding secondary school students. A total of 450 randomly selected students with average age of 19 years were interviewed using self administered questionnaires with both closed and open ended questions. Most of the respondents knew antibiotics but perceived knowledge <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> did not correspond to definition <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> given as 55. 0 % gave a wrong definition <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> The prevalence <b>of</b> misuse of was found to be high, indicated by the fact that 58. 4 % used antibiotics for condition that do not require antibiotics, 40. 7 % do not complete their dose regimen. 25. 8 % get their antibiotics without prescription, majority (53. 9 %) of whom get it from the pharmacy and 54. 6 % share antibiotics with friends. This study therefore found that there was misuse <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> among the studied population and this could be due to the observed poor knowledge <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> among the students. Usage <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> among the students was high (92. 8 %) and the antibiotics were used for wrong disease conditions (irrational use). Most of the students procure the drugs from pharmacies and this is a major factor contributing to misuse <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics.</b> I It is recommended that doctors should explain the importance <b>of</b> compliance to <b>antibiotics</b> and danger <b>of</b> being non compliant to their clients- drug regulatory authority should strengthen the laws on sales <b>of</b> <b>antibiotics</b> as over the counter drugs especially to pharmacy dealers. And education about antibiotics would also be helpful to reduce misuse and consequent development of resistance...|$|R
25|$|Many P. aeruginosa {{isolates}} {{are resistant}} to a large range of antibiotics and may demonstrate additional resistance after unsuccessful treatment. It should usually be possible to guide treatment according to laboratory sensitivities, rather than choosing an antibiotic empirically.

25|$|Mechanisms {{underlying}} {{antibiotic resistance}} {{have been found}} to include production of antibiotic-degrading or antibiotic-inactivating enzymes, outer membrane proteins to evict the antibiotics and mutations to change antibiotic targets. Presence of antibiotic-degrading enzymes such as extended-spectrum β-lactamases like PER-1, PER-2, VEB-1, AmpC cephalosporinases, carbapenemases like serine oxacillinases, metallo-b-lactamases, OXA-type carbapenemases, aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, among others have been reported. P. aeruginosa can also modify the targets <b>of</b> <b>antibiotic</b> action, for example methylation of 16S rRNA to prevent aminoglycoside binding and modification of DNA, or topoisomerase to protect it from the action of quinolones.
