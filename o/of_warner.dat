40|$|The {{presence}} {{of music and}} sound is crucially important in the writing <b>of</b> Sylvia Townsend <b>Warner</b> (1873 - 1978). A noticeably acoustic writer, music, and noise in general, are major tools Warner employed to convey the vacillation of the Modernist perspective. Examining the deployment of these tools reveals a type of musical rhetoric which is built around aural ekphrasis and literary synesthesia, and this study concentrates on this feature <b>of</b> three <b>of</b> <b>Warner's</b> novels and one short story: Lolly Willowes (1926), Mr. Fortune's Maggot (1927), The Corner That Held Them (1948), and "Emil" (1956). While the exact patterns <b>of</b> <b>Warner's</b> use <b>of</b> music and sound throughout her fiction ultimately remain ambiguous, probing them in these four works does cast light upon Warner's private and public concerns...|$|R
