40|$|Knowledge of top {{predator}} foraging adaptability {{is imperative}} for predicting their biological response to environmental variability. While seabirds have developed highly specialised techniques to locate prey, {{little is known}} about intraspecific variation in foraging strategies with many studies deriving information from uniform oceanic environments. Australasian gannets (Morus serrator) typically forage in continental shelf regions on small schooling prey. The present study used GPS and video data loggers to compare habitat-specific foraging strategies at two sites of contrasting <b>oceanographic</b> regimes (<b>deep</b> water near the continental shelf edge, n= 23; shallow inshore embayment, n= 26), in south-eastern Australia. Individuals from the continental shelf site exhibited pelagic foraging behaviours typical of gannet species, using local enhancement to locate and feed on small schooling fish; in contrast only 50 % of the individuals from the inshore site foraged offshore, displaying the typical pelagic foraging strategy. The remainder adopted a strategy of searching sand banks in shallow inshore waters in the absence of conspecifics and other predators for large, single prey items. Furthermore, of the individuals foraging inshore, 93 % were male, indicating that the inshore strategy may be sex-specific. Large inter-colony differences in Australasian gannets suggest strong plasticity in foraging behaviours, essential for adapting to environmental change...|$|R

The long range purpose of this organization is to obtain continuous core samples of the entire sedimentary column from the floors of the oceans.

40|$|Seismic wave {{propagation}} through two-dimensional core-mantle boundary (CMB) ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs) is modeled using a global pseudospectral algorithm. Seismograms are synthesized for {{several types of}} ULVZ models to investigate {{the effect of these}} structures on SKS and SPdKS phases. One-dimensional models and two-dimensional models with different, quasi- 1 -D velocity structures on the source and receiver sides of the CMB provide a baseline for comparison with other 2 -D models. Models with finite length ULVZs are used to test the sensitivity of the SPdKS travel time and waveform to different portions of the P diffracted wave path. This test shows that SPdKS waves are only sensitive to ULVZs with lengths > 100 km. Our results give three tools for identifying and characterizing 2 -D ULVZ structures. First, dual SPdKS pulses indicate exposure to at least two separate CMB velocity structures, either different source and receiver-side CMB velocities or different adjacent velocity regions for which Pdiff inception occurs outside of and propagates into a ULVZ. Second, high-amplitude SKS precursors indicate a very “strong” (i. e., thick and/or large velocity perturbations) ULVZ. Hence, the absence of SKS precursors in most previous ULVZ studies indicates that very strong, sharp ULVZs are not common. Third, mean SPdKS delays relative to PREM constrain the minimum ULVZ strength and length combinations required to produce a given travel time delay. National Science Foundation (U. S.)

40|$|Simple alkyl thiols such as {{methanethiol}} (CH[subscript 3]SH) {{are widely}} speculated {{to form in}} seafloor hot spring fluids. Putative CH[subscript 3]SH synthesis by abiotic (nonbiological) reduction of inorganic carbon (CO[subscript 2] or CO) has been invoked as an initiation reaction {{for the emergence of}} protometabolism and microbial life in primordial hydrothermal settings. Thiols are also presumptive ligands for hydrothermal trace metals and potential fuels for associated microbial communities. In an effort to constrain sources and sinks of CH[subscript 3]SH in seafloor hydrothermal systems, we determined for the first time its abundance in diverse hydrothermal fluids emanating from ultramafic, mafic, and sediment-covered midocean ridge settings. Our data demonstrate that the distribution of CH[subscript 3]SH is inconsistent with metastable equilibrium with inorganic carbon, indicating that production by abiotic carbon reduction is more limited than previously proposed. CH[subscript 3]SH concentrations are uniformly low (∼ 10 [superscript − 8] M) in high-temperature fluids (> 200 °C) from all unsedimented systems and, in many cases, suggestive of metastable equilibrium with CH[subscript 4] instead. Associated low-temperature fluids (< 200 °C) formed by admixing of seawater, however, are invariably enriched in CH[subscript 3] 3 SH (up to ∼ 10 [superscript − 6] M) along with NH[+ over 4] and low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons relative to high-temperature source fluids, resembling our observations from a sediment-hosted system. This strongly implicates thermogenic interactions between upwelling fluids and microbial biomass or associated dissolved organic matter during subsurface mixing in crustal aquifers. Widespread thermal degradation of subsurface organic matter may be an important source of organic production in unsedimented hydrothermal systems and may influence microbial metabolic strategies in cooler near-seafloor and plume habitats.

Whereas only chlorins are present in the immature samples, porphyrins, including VO-porphyrins, appear in the thermally altered deposits, despite the shallow burial depth. Alkane distributions in thermally changed samples are characterized by low values of phytane to 2 -C 18 ratios and an odd/even carbon preference index close to unity. The thermally altered samples show unusual carbon isotope distributions of the bitumen fractions.

Individual mean oxygen corrected consumption rates were 0. 1 – 10. 9 % lower than the uncorrected ones. At the currently low predator stock size, however, the effect of oxygen-reduced consumption on {{the total amount of}} eaten prey biomass and thus predation mortalities was only marginal.

The planktonic oxygen isotope record of this core, reflecting predominantly sea surface temperature (SST), shows a pattern of millennial-scale oscillations that {{is very similar to}} climatic changes recorded by the Greenland ice core records over the same interval. In turn, tree populations show a pattern of rapid expansions and contractions that follow the pronounced and abrupt isotopic shifts recorded offshore. Through Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3, this millennial-scale pattern of vegetation change, alternating between steppe and open woodland, is superimposed on a longer-term pattern of shrinking ericaceous heathland and decreasing size of successive interstadial tree populations. Trees persisted during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), at greater abundance than during many of the coldest episodes of MIS 3. This agrees with the marine data which indicate that LGM sea surface temperatures here were significantly warmer than the minima recorded in MIS 3. Our combined marine-terrestrial record, together with data from nearby sequences, provides a stepping stone between terrestrial sequences and the Greenland ice core and North Atlantic marine records.

40|$|Because {{the average}} ocean depth is four kilometers, {{seafloor}} investigations are mostly remote sensing operations. The primary means {{to determine the}} morphology, the structure, and {{the texture of the}} seafloor are acoustic. This paper considers the current seafloor remote sensing approaches involving acoustic backscattering. The physical constraints imposed by the ocean as a propagation medium, by the seafloor as a backscattering boundary, and by the measuring instruments are briefly reviewed. The sonar systems currently used by the <b>oceanographic</b> community for <b>deep</b> seafloor acoustic backscattering measurements deal with these constraints differently, depending on their specific application and on whether they are towed behind a ship or mounted on her hull. Towed sidescan systems such as Gloria II (U. K.), the Sea Mapping and Remote Characterization (Sea MARC) I and II, the Deep Tow system of the Marine Physical Laboratory (MPL), and hull-mounted systems, such as Swathmap all give a qualitative measure of backscattering by converting echo amplitudes to gray levels to produce a sidescan image of the seafloor. A new approach is presented which uses a Sea Beam multibeam echo-sounder to produce similar acoustic images. Quantitative measurements of backscattering have been attempted in recent experiments using the Deep Tow system and Sea Beam. Such measurements provide some insight into the geological processes responsible for the acoustic backscatter, with useful applications for geologists as well as designers and operators of bottom-interacting sonars...|$|R

Its long-term variability can be reconstructed using deep-dwelling planktonic foraminifera that record subsurface conditions. Here we used six species (Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, Globorotalia tumida, Globorotalia inflata, Globorotalia truncatulinoides, Globorotalia hirsuta, and Globorotalia crassaformis) from 66 core tops along a meridional transect spanning the mid-Atlantic (42 °N to 25 °S) to develop a method for reconstructing past thermocline conditions. We estimated the calcification depths from δ 18 O measurements and the Mg/Ca-temperature relationships for each species. This systematic strategy over this large latitudinal section reveals distinct populations with different Mg/Ca-temperature relationships for G. inflata, G. truncatulinoides, and G. hirsuta in different areas. The calcification depths do not differ among the different populations, except for G. hirsuta, where the northern population calcifies much shallower than the southern population.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} parallel hypothesis method for {{autonomous underwater vehicle}} navigation that enables a vehicle to expand the operating envelope of existing long baseline acoustic navigation systems by incorporating information that is not normally used. The parallel hypothesis method allows the in-situ identification of acoustic multipath time-of-flight measurements between a vehicle and an external transponder and uses them in real-time to augment the navigation algorithm during periods when direct-path time-of-flight measurements are not available. A proof of concept was conducted using real-world data obtained by the Woods Hole <b>Oceanographic</b> Institution <b>Deep</b> Submergence Lab's Autonomous Benthic Explorer (ABE) and Sentry autonomous underwater vehicles during operations on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. This algorithm uses a nested architecture to break the navigation solution down into basic building blocks {{for each type of}} available external information. The algorithm classifies external information as either line of position or gridded observations. For any line of position observation, the algorithm generates a multi-modal block of parallel position estimate hypotheses. The multimodal hypotheses are input into an arbiter which produces a single unimodal output. If a priori maps of gridded information are available, they are used within the arbiter structure to aid in the elimination of false hypotheses. (cont.) For the proof of concept, this research uses ranges from a single external acoustic transponder in the hypothesis generation process and grids of low-resolution bathymetric data from a ship-based multibeam sonar in the arbitration process. The major contributions of this research include the in-situ identification of acoustic multipath time-of-flight measurements, the multiscale utilization of a priori low resolution bathymetric data in a high-resolution navigation algorithm, and the design of a navigation algorithm with a flexible architecture. This flexible architecture allows the incorporation of multimodal beliefs without requiring a complex mechanism for real-time hypothesis generation and culling, and it allows the real-time incorporation of multiple types of external information as they become available in situ into the overall navigation solution. by Cara Elizabeth Grupe LaPointe.

The Taiwanese tuna fishery began operating in the Indian Ocean in 1967. We used a geographic information system to compile a fishery and environmental database and statistically explored the catch per unit effort (CPUE) distribution of albacore. Our results indicated that immature albacore were mainly distributed in areas south of 30 S although some displayed a north–south seasonal migration. Mature albacore, which were mainly concentrated between 10 S and 25 S, also showed a north–south migration. Within 10 S and 30 S, the separation of mature, spawning, and immature albacore life history stages roughly coincided with {{the boundaries of the}} three oceanic current systems in the Indian Ocean. The optimal environmental variables for CPUE prediction by stepwise discriminant analysis differed among life history stages.

Further, by the help of these methods we have succeeded in solving important problems which {{would otherwise have been}} insoluable by only using the material obtained from the cruises. An example has been described above as to how the distribution of air pressure well in advance, can influence the herring fishery along the west coast. From the results here arrived at we shall when next a similar meteorological situation arises under comparable conditions of temperature, be prepared to expect certain consequences. We shall know reasonably far in advance when the (cold) Baltic water front will reach the several parts of the south and west coasts. We shall then be able to take our measures when it concerns the fishing. For a closer study of the movements of the water front, we shall then be able to apply the most suitable methods of investigation in ample time, and along the best localities, and also to examine nearer what effect different sorts of wind may have on the front after it has reached the Norwegian Coast. By maintaining two permanent oceanographic stations in the spring herring fishery district, one off Egersund and one off Bømlo, we will together with the oceanographic observations taken by the Flødevigen Hatchery near Arendal, the permanent station on the Sognesjø, and the temperature registrations taken on the line steamers, have at our disposal material that will allow of our being able to follow the movements of the front fairly well, and also decide the thickness of the penetrating watermass.

40|$|The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) uses {{a variety}} of {{technology}} for use in its deep water scientific research, including the Joint <b>Oceanographic</b> Institutions for <b>Deep</b> Earth Sampling (JOIDES) Resolution (JR) drill ship. The JR drill ship has been selected to core a deep basement hole. The goal is to core approximately 3000 meters below the seafloor in water depths approaching 700 meters. This borehole is estimated to reach and core the igneous lower crust and the crust-mantle transition. Previous expeditions have cored to depths approaching 1500 meters below the seafloor, so this goal is significantly deeper than previous attempts. While it is a capable vessel, the JOIDES Resolution does have several limitations, mostly related to the drilling fluid system. These limitations need to be understood and their effect on the operation addressed prior to the beginning operations. The object {{of this study is}} to determine if the limitations, such as pumping and storage capabilities, will prevent the ship from being able to core to the desired depth. The first step will be to further define the limitations that are present in the given well plan. This will be done via analysis of drilling hydraulics and hole cleaning capability. From sensitivity analysis using WELLPLAN^(TM), it was determined that the JR drillship will be able to provide hydraulics and hole cleaning capability to reach the upper mantle. Using WELLPLAN^(TM), modeling was done for four different depths along the wellbore to determine the cutting volume concentration buildup, minimum flow rate required, and equivalent circulating density. By conducting sensitivity analysis on rate of penetration, pump rate, cutting diameter size, and cutting density, it was determined that the drill ship has the capacity to properly clean the hole. After the hydraulics and hole cleaning have been evaluated, the next step is to come up with a viable mud program that can be used for the operation. The end result is an analysis that not only determines if the geological coring of the crust and mantle transition can be accomplished but gives operational recommendations on how to achieve the stated goal with a minimal risk of drilling problems. With seawater being the main drilling fluid, it is recommended to add gel sweeps at regular intervals to ensure proper transportation of drill cuttings to the seafloor. It is also important to maintain sufficient pump rate, especially with larger sized cuttings or increased rate of penetrations. Using proper flow rate, rate of penetration, and gel sweep intervals will provide sufficient hole cleaning capacity for the JR drillship to core to the Moho...|$|R
