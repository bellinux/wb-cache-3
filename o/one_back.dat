5|$|Also, {{perching}} bird. Any bird of {{the order}} Passeriformes, which includes {{more than half of}} all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and <b>one</b> <b>back,</b> which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. The order has roughly twice as many species as Rodentia, the largest order of mammals. There are more than 110 families of passerine birds, the second-most of any tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles).|$|E
5|$|Gill {{played in}} almost every game after the League Cup Final until Francis left the club the {{following}} October, but lost his place soon afterwards through injury. Though he did then receive a League Cup runners-up medal: club secretary Alan Jones had kept a spare <b>one</b> <b>back,</b> which he presented to Gill after Francis left. Under new manager Steve Bruce he played only one game, a 3–0 FA Cup defeat at Liverpool for which Jeff Kenna was cup-tied, and when the team won promotion to the Premier League that season, {{it became clear that}} his future lay elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|In Small Heath's {{last game}} in October, {{at home to}} Darwen, a 3–2 victory was marred by a serious injury to full-back Fred Speller. Soon after kickoff. Speller was {{in the act of}} kicking the ball when the onrushing William Campbell {{collided}} with him, knocking him to the ground. A police constable administered first aid before the player, whose leg was broken, was carried from the field on a plank and taken to hospital. On a heavy pitch in poor condition, it was nearly impossible to dribble the ball, and Small Heath's decision to play on with only <b>one</b> <b>back</b> meant Darwen's attackers were frequently caught offside.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} session, Maguire {{took the first}} frame, but Higgins won the next three, compiling a 100 break in the third. Breaks of 72, 55, and 76 allowed Maguire to regain the lead, before Higgins took the eighth after Maguire missed a straightforward red to leave it 4–4 {{at the end of}} the first session. In the evening session, Higgins took the ninth, before Maguire made two breaks over 50 in the 10th. Higgins then made two consecutive century breaks, including a 144 in the 11th, which equalled his own highest break. He continued his run with a break of 68 in the 13th, before Maguire pulled <b>one</b> <b>back</b> in the next. A 97 break gave Higgins the victory.|$|E

Ángel got another goal in the second half, before N'Gotty's header and a second Okocha free kick gave Bolton a 5–2 victory. Six days later in the second leg at Villa Park, Bolton lost 2–0 to a Villa team who had Gavin McCann sent off {{in the first}} half, but advanced to the final 5–4 on aggregate.|$|E

5|$|Bengaluru FC flagged February {{off with}} a home game against Sporting Clube de Goa. After missing an early chance, Bengaluru lost the lead when Odafa Onyeka Okolie scored in the 9th minute. Bengaluru's attack were unable to convert chances against 10-men Sporting until C.K. Vineeth found {{the back of the}} net in 64th minute. However, the home team's joy was short lived as Odafa {{completed}} his brace in 74th minute and Bengaluru faced first loss at home in the season. In the next home game Bengaluru FC faced I-League debutant DSK Shivajians F.C.. Bengaluru were leading 2–0 with a goal each from Sunil Chhetri and Kim Song-Yong, but due to a defensive error from Bengaluru FC, DSK Shivajians pulled <b>one</b> <b>back</b> by a goal from ex-Bengaluru player Sampath Kuttymani, just before the half time. Bengaluru FC finished the game 4–1 with two more goals in the second half from substitutes Shankar Sampingiraj and Seminlen Doungel, and reclaimed the top spot. In the next game against the defending champion, Mohun Bagan, after the goalless first half, Lalchhuanmawia was sent off by the referee. Jeje Lalpekhlua finally broke the deadlock in 73rd minute from Cornell Glenn's pass. Mohun Bagan doubled the lead by Sony Norde's goal and Bengaluru FC faced second defeat at home and third defeat of the season. After facing a string of defeats, Bengaluru FC got back to winning ways against Aizawl F.C., when C.K. Vineeth's second half goal was enough to secure 3 points.|$|E
5|$|Bengaluru FC {{started their}} {{campaign}} in the away game against Vietnamese team Lao Toyota F.C.. A defensive lapse by Curtis Osano and an excellent free-kick just outside the penalty box from Phatthana Syvilay meant that Bengaluru were trailing by 2–0 at the 30 minutes mark. In the second half, Lao Toyota were reduced to 10 men, but Bengaluru were unable {{to capitalize on the}} chances created. However, C.K. Vineeth pulled <b>one</b> <b>back</b> in the stoppage time, and the score ended at 2–1 in the favour of the home team. Injury-ridden Bengaluru FC faced defending AFC cup champions Johor Darul Ta'zim at home. The game was decided by a solitary goal from Mohd Safiq Rahim in 55th minute and Bengaluru succumbed to second consecutive defeat in the AFC cup. Bengaluru FC finally secured its first win against Ayeyawady United when the solitary goal from the captain Sunil Chhetri in the first half was enough to secure 0–1 win for the team.|$|E

5|$|Bradford {{started their}} league season on 11 August 2007 with a 1–1 draw with Macclesfield Town, when {{a crowd of}} 14,345 was inside Valley Parade, 1,000 more than was {{originally}} announced. The attendance was more than 6,000 higher than any other game in the division. Macclesfield had taken the lead, with City equalising shortly before half-time when Guylain Ndumbu-Nsungu scored with a rebound after Barry Conlon's penalty was saved. Four days later City were at Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers, for {{the first round of}} the League Cup. Wolves scored twice in the first five minutes of the second half, and despite Kyle Nix pulling <b>one</b> <b>back</b> for Bradford, City went out 2–1. City's second league game of the season was the first league game to be played at Shrewsbury Town's new £15m ground the New Meadow, when an early penalty from former City player Dave Hibbert gave the home side a 1–0 win. McCall's first win as manager came in the third game when a debut goal from Luke Medley secured a 2–1 victory over Wrexham.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{were drawn}} to play at home against Birmingham City in the Fifth Round, with Birmingham {{dominating}} the first half through a David Murphy goal. Daniel Sturridge scored {{in the second half}} to force a replay, which was played on 6 March at Birmingham, just two days after André Villas-Boas was relieved of his duties as Chelsea manager. Birmingham held Chelsea throughout the first half, and looked the stronger side at times, but after Mata and Raul Meireles scored twice in five minutes, Chelsea dominated the remainder of the game until the final whistle. In the Sixth Round, Chelsea overcame Leicester City at home in a 5–2 thriller. Gary Cahill scored his first FA Cup goal for Chelsea from a corner in the 12th minute, with Salomon Kalou following up five minutes later. In the second half, Fernando Torres ended a goal drought of over 25 hours to score, before Jermaine Beckford gave Leicester a late lifeline. Torres scored again in the 85th minute to put the result beyond doubt, although Ben Marshall grabbed <b>one</b> <b>back</b> three minutes later, before Meireles scored in the 90th minute to send Chelsea through to the semi-final.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{a modern}} soprano {{clarinet}} is equipped with numerous tone holes of which seven (six front, <b>one</b> <b>back)</b> are covered with the fingertips, and the rest are opened or closed using a set of keys. These tone holes let the player produce every note of the chromatic scale. On alto and larger clarinets, and a few soprano clarinets, key-covered holes replace some or all finger holes. The most common system of keys was named the Boehm system by its designer Hyacinthe Klosé in honour of flute designer Theobald Boehm, {{but it is not}} the same as the Boehm system used on flutes. The other main system of keys is called the Oehler system and is used mostly in Germany and Austria (see History). The related Albert system is used by some jazz, klezmer, and eastern European folk musicians. The Albert and Oehler systems are both based on the early Mueller system.|$|E

5|$|To do this, Rincewind is told to {{discover}} who they are, and recover a golden item from each, since these items {{are what they}} use to control the dragon. Learning that a book about summoning dragons had been stolen from the library at Unseen University the night before, Rincewind gains access to L-Space, allowing him to journey into the past, witness the theft, and follow the thief back to the brotherhood's hideout. After gaining entry in disguise, Rincewind learns that each member holds {{a role in the}} city — Chucky the Fool, the Thief, the Mason, the Chimney Sweep, the Fishmonger, and the Dunny King — and seeks to change the city so they can have a better future for themselves. Acquiring their golden items, Rincewind brings them to the dragon, only to learn it will not return to its dimension but seek revenge on the brotherhood before coming after him. Wishing to stop this, Rincewind decides to prevent the summoning book from being stolen, by switching it for one that makes love custard. In his efforts to be recognised for stopping the dragon, Rincewind gets into an argument with the Patrician over the existence of dragons, summoning the very same <b>one</b> <b>back</b> to Discworld. An annoyed Patrician tasks Rincewind to deal with it.|$|E
