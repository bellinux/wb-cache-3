40|$|The rapidly {{increasing}} power conversion efficiencies of organic solar cells {{are an important}} prerequisite towards low cost photovoltaic fabricated in high throughput. In this work we suggest indane as a non-halogenated replacement for the commonly used halogenated solvent <b>o-dichlorobenzene.</b> Indane was blended with the higher volatile solvents chloroform or toluene or o-xylene {{in order to improve}} wettability and to reduce drying time. The combination of high volatile solvents with the less volatile host solvent indane allows for an increased fabrication speed due to a reduction of the overall drying time and provides films with good light absorption behavior and high polymer crystallinity. For the solvent mixture tolueneindane, solar cell performance is comparable to the <b>o-dichlorobenzene</b> reference device indicating this mixture as a suitable replacement for increased productivity without drawbacks in nanomorphology as investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD).

When the mixtures of La(III) and Ba(II) were extracted for 5 min at pH 4. 5, only lanthanum(III) was extracted quantitatively, whereas barium(II) remained in the aqueous phase. After the phases were separated, barium(II) was extracted quantitatively for 5 min at pH 7. 9 again. Then, the two phases were each shaken with 0. 1 M HCl in order to back-extract lanthanum(III) and barium(II) from the organic phases; both metal ions were determined by ICP-AES.

The consortia were immobilized on a porous perlite support packed into filter columns. Metered airstreams containing the contaminant vapors were partially humidified and passed through these columns. The vapor concentrations prior to and after biofiltration were measured by gas chromatography. Liquid was circulated concurrently with the air, and the device was operated in the trickling air biofilter mode. The experimental arrangement allowed the independent variation of liquid flow, airflow, and solvent vapor concentrations. Bench-scale trickling air biofilters removed monochlorobenzene, <b>o-dichlorobenzene,</b> and their mixtures at rates of up to 300 g of solvent vapor h(- 1) m(- 3) filter volume. High liquid recirculation rates and automated pH control were critical for stable filtration performance.
