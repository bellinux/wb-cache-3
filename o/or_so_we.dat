500|$|Coming off an 8–4 season during which, {{according}} to USA Today's Paul Myerberg, [...] "Attrition robbed Penn State of {{everything but the}} kitchen sink, <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> heard, so it was quite surprising when the sink, a few walk-ons, a mathematician, a local kid and a rookie coach went 8-2 after a sluggish start, pushing back against storm clouds and bringing PSU back from the abyss of life post-NCAA sanctions." [...] Many college football analysts expected the Nittany Lions to perform similarly in 2013, although almost all season outlooks noted that the team could take a major step back from 2012 if they were hampered by injuries, or could surprise everyone and win more games {{than they did in}} 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Here’s an example: Suppose we {{see before}} us {{a parking lot}} full of {{hundreds}} of cars. We decide {{to go around the}} entire lot looking for: “Cars with flat (bad) tires”. After an hour <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> have found two “cars with bad tires.” We can now say with certainty that “Some cars have bad tires”. Or we could say: “It’s not true that ‘All the cars have good tires’”. Or: “It is true that: ‘not all the cars have good tires”. Let us go to another lot. Here we discover that “All the cars have good tires.” We might say, “There’s not a single instance of a car having a bad tire.” [...] Thus we see that, if we can say something about each car separately then we can say something about ALL of them collectively.|$|E
2500|$|The story, {{which is}} {{told in the}} first person, centers on down-and-out actor Lawrence Smith (stage name Lorenzo Smythe, also known as [...] "The Great Lorenzo"). A {{brilliant}} actor and mimic (<b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> are told, by Smith himself), he is down to his last coin when a spaceman hires him to double for an unspecified public figure. It is only when he {{is on his way}} to Mars that he finds out he will have to impersonate one of the most prominent politicians in the solar system (and one with whose views Smith deeply disagrees): John Joseph Bonforte. Bonforte is the leader of the Expansionist coalition, currently out of office but with a good chance of changing that at the next general election. Bonforte has been kidnapped by his political opponents, and his aides want Smith to impersonate Bonforte while they try to find him.|$|E
30|$|The {{proof of}} Theorem 2.1 {{is similar to}} that in [22] <b>or</b> [25]. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> omit it here.|$|R
50|$|They {{should also}} be {{initialized}} to 0, <b>or</b> NULL, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> {{know what they are}} to start with.|$|R
25|$|Life has no meaning, but {{as humans}} {{we try to}} {{associate}} a meaning <b>or</b> purpose <b>so</b> <b>we</b> can justify our existence.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned to}} the kerb, {{and for a second}} <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> stood there without speaking. Then I beckoned to a hansom.|$|E
60|$|After {{five minutes}} <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> {{returned}} {{and examined the}} thermometer. It had risen to 98 degrees, the natural temperature of the human body.|$|E
60|$|In {{a quarter}} of an hour <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> were back at the physician's house. He came running out to meet us with a face of horror.|$|E
30|$|Now, by Theorem  3.1, {{we cannot}} give whether the {{solution}} of (3.1) is stochastic asymptotic stability <b>or</b> not. <b>So,</b> <b>we</b> present the main results of this paper as follows.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, it is possible," [...] said Forester, [...] "that {{we may be}} kept here in {{the woods}} a day <b>or</b> two; <b>so</b> <b>we</b> must use our {{provisions}} economically." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Syme, [...] "it {{seems that}} {{we have all the}} same kind of {{morality}} <b>or</b> immorality, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> had better face the fact that comes of it." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{picked up}} the spanner {{and went to work}} again without paying any further {{attention}} to us. After looking at him for a minute <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> <b>we</b> went away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Agreed," [...] said I; and for {{the next}} ten minutes <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> walked beside each other in silence. Suddenly our {{footsteps}} were arrested by a low peculiar noise.|$|E
6000|$|... "WELL!" [...] {{says the}} lawyer, [...] "this IS {{a state of}} things. I've got some of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> can com--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't go {{very much}} on what folks call luck, lad. The thing was bound to come whether you saw the vein <b>or</b> not, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> must buck agin it." ...|$|R
6000|$|In the N.W. Quarter, {{only one}} of the two Cells is marked as [...] empty: <b>so</b> <b>we</b> do not know whether the N.W. Quarter of the [...] Biliteral Diagram is {{occupied}} <b>or</b> empty: <b>so</b> <b>we</b> cannot mark [...] it.|$|R
5000|$|Starting from cell [...] i.e. {{the first}} cell. The cell is {{occupied}} and it doesn't have cells {{to the left}} <b>or</b> above <b>so</b> <b>we</b> will label this cell with a new label say [...]|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't say so. He's an unsympathetic felon--the Hun. But {{he might}} cherish a {{dachshund}} <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> <b>We</b> never picked up any ships' pets off him, and I'm sure we should {{if there had}} been." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet {{in every}} woman there dwells a spirit, <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> believe, and in thee a great one, <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> have heard and believe, O Lady of the Heavens. To thee, then, again we repeat {{the words of}} Dingaan and of his council which to-day we have said in the ears of him who thinks himself thy father. To thee the roads are open; thine are the cattle and the kraals; here is an earnest of them. Thine are the lives of men. Command now, if thou wilt, that one of us be slain before thee, and whilst thou watchest, he shall look his last upon the moon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Niver a taste, sor; {{we could}} soon {{overhaul}} them agin. An' won't {{they have to}} camp at sundown anyhow? Moreover, if we don't come up wi' the bar in a mile <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> can give it up." ...|$|E
5000|$|The actual type {{specifications}} can consist {{of an actual}} type, such as , or a general type variable that is used in parametric polymorphic functions, such as , <b>or</b> , <b>or</b> [...] <b>So</b> <b>we</b> can write something like: ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{matter was}} decided there. [...] "You {{send her to}} me, when she gets ready, and I'll have Mrs. Thatcher look after her for a week <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> till <b>we</b> find her a place to stay." ...|$|R
60|$|As to No. 7, {{we are in}} {{the same}} {{condition}} as with No. 5--we find it PARTLY 'empty', but we do not know whether the other part is empty <b>or</b> occupied: <b>so</b> <b>we</b> dare not mark this Square.|$|R
60|$|Every {{half mile}} <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> passed a ranch house, {{and as we}} {{traveled}} on these ranches grew further apart, until, twelve or fifteen miles out of Sanderson, they were so widely separated that each appeared alone on the wild range.|$|E
6000|$|... "We won't {{need to hold}} {{either of}} them for long," [...] {{observed}} Beth; [...] "for in another three weeks <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> must leave here {{and return to the}} city, when of course the Millville Daily Tribune must suspend publication." ...|$|E
60|$|Then for {{a moment}} <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> were silent, with our sense of the immense gravity of this {{position}} growing upon us. A little tow-headed waiter-boy appeared with their coffee and rolls on a tray poised high on his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Probably, if {{she wishes}} it," [...] he replied; [...] "but I {{want to travel}} first for a year <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> before <b>we</b> settle {{definitely}} upon anything. I {{did not think that}} you would be so much surprised, Sophy." ...|$|R
30|$|We {{remark that}} every nontrivial {{solution}} of (1.6) has an unsaturated lower positive part {{under the same}} conditions as Theorems 4.1, 4.2, <b>or</b> 4.3. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> can obtain that every nontrivial solution of (1.6) has an unsaturated positive part.|$|R
5000|$|On September 30, 2009, Brigitte's {{jury found}} her {{guilty of the}} lesser {{included}} offense of second-degree manslaughter. One juror reported that [...] "None of us felt that she deserved to get any murder charges <b>or</b> anything. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> decided on second-degree Manslaughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{a minute}} <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> walked on silently, {{and then she}} said: [...] "I do not {{want you to think}} I am hard-hearted, but I must say what is in me. I congratulate you, and, at the same time, I am sorry for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Master. Still, oil {{is of no}} use {{without a}} lamp, or a soul without a body, at least here {{underneath}} the sun, <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> were taught who worship the Grasshopper. But, Master, when you came back from all your hunting, what happened then?" ...|$|E
60|$|LARRY [quite {{unconscious}} of his cruelty]. In a week <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> {{shall be}} quite old friends again. Meanwhile, as I feel that I am not making myself particularly entertaining, I'll take myself off. Tell Tom I've {{gone for a}} stroll over the hill.|$|E
6000|$|A day <b>or</b> <b>so</b> after <b>we</b> {{went out}} to those {{pleasant}} black-robed, bearded Armenians in their monastery at Saint Lazzaro, and returned towards sundown. We fell into silence. [...] "PIU LENTO," [...] said Margaret to the gondolier, and released my accumulated resolution.|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way," [...] {{said the}} {{landlord}} in conclusion, [...] "you {{are not the}} only friend of Lady Frances Carfax who is inquiring after her just now. Only a week <b>or</b> <b>so</b> ago <b>we</b> had a man here upon the same errand." ...|$|R
60|$|We alighted on the birch bluff that {{stretched}} out some distance into the prairie from {{the foot of}} the plateau, and spent an hour <b>or</b> <b>so</b> before <b>we</b> decided that the new site was more favorable than the other. Then Lyle turned to me.|$|R
