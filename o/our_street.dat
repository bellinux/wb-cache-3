500|$|The {{success of}} Jennifer Worth's memoir Call the Midwife (2002, reissued 2007), {{which became a}} major best-seller and was adapted by the BBC into their most popular new {{programme}} since the current ratings system began, {{has led to a}} high level of interest in true-life stories from the East End. Melanie McGrath's Silvertown (2003), about her grandmother's life in the East End, was also a best-seller, as was the follow-up Hopping, about the annual East Enders' 'holiday' hop-picking in Kent. [...] A raft of similar books was published in the 2000s, among them Gilda O'Neill's best-selling <b>Our</b> <b>Street</b> (2004), Piers Dudgeon's Our East End (2009), Jackie Hyam's Bombsites and Lollipops (2011) and Grace Foakes' Four Meals for Fourpence (reprinted 2011). In 2012, HarperCollins published The Sugar Girls, a book which tells the true stories of women working at Tate & Lyle's factories in Silvertown since 1944. [...] The authors commented that many of the East Enders they interviewed were unhappy with the way their neighbourhoods had previously been portrayed in books and on screen – as squalid and criminal, in the Dickensian vein, and as a result they were keen to emphasise the positive aspects of East End life and community. 2012 also saw the publication of Spitalfields Life, a book adapted from the very successful blog of the same name, in which 'the gentle author' (who is anonymous) writes about, and celebrates, the lives {{of the men and women}} who live and work in the East End community of Spitalfields.|$|E

The dirt road waved {{up and down and}} in and out. the horses made it that way, zigzagging the carts and {{carriages}} through it. The rest of the street was green grass and wild roses. [...] In front of our place Father had made a gravel walk but after our trees stopped there were just two planks to walk on.|$|E
