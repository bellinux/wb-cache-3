5|$|The ACLU {{played a}} major role in passing the 1932 Norris–La Guardia Act, a federal law which {{prohibited}} employers from preventing employees from joining unions, and stopped the practice of <b>outlawing</b> <b>strikes,</b> unions, and labor organizing activities with the use of injunctions. The ACLU also played a key role in initiating a nationwide effort to reduce misconduct (such as extracting false confessions) within police departments, by publishing the report Lawlessness in Law Enforcement in 1931, under the auspices of Herbert Hoover's Wickersham Commission. In 1934, the ACLU lobbied for the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act, which restored some autonomy to Native American tribes, and established penalties for kidnapping Native American children.|$|R

50|$|The strike {{began to}} fall apart after Sun Yat-sen died in March 1925 and Liao Zhongkai, the left-wing leader in Kuomintang was assassinated in August. After Chiang Kai-shek, {{commander-in-chief}} of the National Revolutionary Army, seized the power, he confiscated {{the arms of the}} Strike Committee. The strike received less support as Chiang began his Northern Expedition in mid 1926. On 10 October 1926, the boycott was formally lifted after a compromise settlement was reached, which signified the end of the 16-month strike. Several leftist labour unions including the Chinese Seamen's Union were proscribed and their leaders arrested. New legislation to ban unions from being affiliated with organisation outside the colony and to <b>outlaw</b> <b>strikes</b> with political causes were also enacted.|$|R

50|$|Between 1950 {{and early}} 1952, SOBSI {{attempted}} to mobilize militant actions, raising {{issues such as}} wages, social security and workplace conditions. SOBSI launched a wave of strikes in late 1950. In September 1950 Sarbupri launched a nationwide strike, which paralyzed most estates. The Sarbupri strike resulted in the first major victory for SOBSI, having forced the government to significantly increase the estate workers' minimum wage. Strikes by oil workers {{in the same year}} blocked plans for lay-offs and forces the government to institute a non-contributory pension scheme instead. In response to the SOBSI strike wave several regional commanders of the army <b>outlawed</b> <b>strikes</b> in essential industries. The policy was by the Natsir cabinet in February 1951. Following the issue of the ban, SOBSI turned to sporadic strikes and sabotage actions (such as destroying cargo at ports or crops at plantations).|$|R

2500|$|In March 1943 the Germans {{allowed a}} general {{election}} to be held.

The election, discontent, and a growing feeling of optimism that Germany would be defeated led to widespread strikes and civil disturbances in the summer of 1943. The Danish government refused to deal with the situation {{in a way that would}} satisfy the Germans, who presented an ultimatum to the government, including the following demands, on 28 August 1943: A ban on people assembling in public, <b>outlawing</b> <b>strikes,</b> the introduction of a curfew, censorship should be conducted with German assistance, special (German military) courts should be introduced, and the death penalty should be introduced in cases of sabotage.

A clearly rigged referendum in 1964, which made the CPP the only legal party and declared Kwame Nkrumah as president for life of both nation and party, empowered the opposition. A coup d’état by the National Liberation Council in 1966 ended the reign of the CPP, which was banned thereafter.|$|R

50|$|Spears {{began the}} {{campaign}} {{with a public}} announcement that the political tide was running in favour {{of the government and}} the Conservative Party. The major issue throughout the campaign was the Trade Unions Bill, a measure brought in following the General Strike of 1926 which <b>outlawed</b> secondary <b>strike</b> action and any strike whose purpose was to coerce the government of the day directly or indirectly. He attacked Minto and Edge for opposing the Bill. In so doing he tried to paint Edge as a socialist who stood against Parliamentary government and the liberty of the workers. He also began by offering himself as the party of safeguarding of industry.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, in 1927 the {{government}} passed sweeping anti-union legislation under the Trade Disputes and Trade Union Act. This imposed major curbs on union power, including <b>outlawing</b> sympathetic <b>strikes</b> and mass picketing, {{and ensuring that}} civil service unions were banned from affiliating with the TUC. The 1926 general strike was considered a grave mistake by TUC leaders such as Ernest Bevin. Most historians treat it as a singular event with few long-term consequences, but Pugh says it accelerated the movement of working-class voters to the Labour Party, which led to future gains. The Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 made general strikes illegal and ended the automatic payment of union members to the Labour Party. That act was largely repealed in 1946.|$|R
5|$|Arévalo's {{response}} {{toward the}} non-communist unions was mixed. In 1945, he criminalized all rural labor unions in workplaces {{with fewer than}} 500 workers, which included most plantations. One of the few unions big enough to survive this law was of the banana workers employed by the UFC. In 1946 this union organized a strike, which provoked Arévalo into <b>outlawing</b> all <b>strikes</b> until a new labor code was passed. This led to efforts {{on the part of}} employers to stall the labor code, as well as to exploit workers as far as possible before it was passed. The unions were also damaged when the US government persuaded the American Federation of Labor to found the Organización Regional Internacional del Trabajo (ORIT), a union that took a virulently anti-communist stance.|$|R
50|$|The President's harsh policies, {{and deeply}} corrupt {{state of his}} administration, made him hugely impopular. In 1964, the {{government}} strongly restricted the right of workers to organize and <b>outlawed</b> labour <b>strikes,</b> making the strong trade unions its enemies. In the presidential election the following year Yaméogo was re-elected, with a supposed 100% support and 98.4% turnout. Remarrying a 22-year-old former beauty queen {{a few weeks after}} the October election, he received a cool welcome in Ouagadougou returning from their honeymoon on 6 November. The parliamentary election the following day officially saw a 100% support and 97.4% turnout in favour of the Voltaic Democratic Union, but in fact mass abstention in protest against the President and his party took place. Another large boycott occurred during the following 5 December municipal elections.|$|R
5000|$|Evans {{was charged}} under Section 98, {{the section of}} the Criminal Code, which had been added in the {{aftermath}} of the Winnipeg General <b>Strike</b> <b>outlawing</b> membership in revolutionary organizations.

25|$|In {{jurisdictional}} <b>strikes,</b> <b>outlawed</b> by Taft–Hartley, a union {{strikes in}} order to assign particular work to the employees it represents.

A later statute, the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, passed in 1959, tightened these restrictions on secondary boycotts still further.|$|R
40|$|The session {{attracted}} {{an audience}} of about 30. There {{was a very good}} discussion afterwards of all the papers, including my own, with a suggestion that more needed to be said about why Alberta remained so conservative despite the fightback of the workers that my paper suggested had occurred in the 1960 s and 1970 s. I will incorporate that suggestion into a revised version of the paper that is intended as a book chapter. Most commentators during the session and afterwards were positive; they indicated that they thought that the role of the working class and the labour movement in Alberta received little attention in the scholarly literature and that my paper and those of the other presenters were very welcome. Since I was the organizer of the session and had approached the various speakers, I was pleased that our session went over so well. The focus would be on the young labour force of this period, changing social values, and the impact on working-class lives and on trade unionism. The switch from company unionism in the provincial civil service to AUPE, the combative unionism of the UNA and other public sector unions, and the successes of the construction unions in extracting good contracts from employers before the boom ended will be featured here. The AFL materials will focus on its efforts—successes and failures [...] to get better occupational health and safety legislation and various social insurance programs, while combating legislation that limited workers’ rights to organize and to strike, including the 1977 legislation <b>outlawing</b> <b>strikes</b> in the civil service and other government sectors. Labour’s role in creating the NDP and in working with various community groups will also be highlighted. The challenge to the labour movement’s masculine views of everything in the latter years of this period as well as its traditional anti-immigration stance will be yet another focus. The social history materials would also deal with the large group of workers who remained quite poor and marginalized throughout the boom, and debunk the new mythology that Peter Lougheed was a Red Tory who was looking out for everyone. The prevalence of women and minorities among this poor in the midst of plenty will also be discussed...|$|R

5000|$|M&M and Southern Californians {{decided the}} best way to stamp out unions was to remove the unions' most {{powerful}} weapons: The strike and picket line. M&M quickly established its own front group, the Employers' Advisory Service, to help employers set company unions. Both Southern Californians and M&M spent more than $123,000 in 1937 to promote a voter referendum which would <b>outlaw</b> the <b>strike</b> and picket line. [...] Their opportunity came when a Republican Party group began digging up dirt on Republican Mayor Frank L. Shaw. Voters were outraged when a private detective employed by the reform group was nearly killed by a car bomb planted by Shaw's organization. Another Republican, Superior Court Judge Fletcher Bowron, began a recall effort against Shaw. M&M and Southern Californians used the recall election to push through their ordinance. The new law explicitly outlawed picketing entirely unless a majority of a firm's employees was on strike, made it illegal for anyone except a striking employee to picket a firm, limited pickets to one person per entrance or pickets at least 25 feet apart, prohibited coercion and intimidation by unions, forbade unions to talk to workers at home, and even outlawed unions' use of abusive or foul language. A compromise referendum pushed by the AFL prohibited public disorder and intimidation but not picketing. The voters approved the M&M referendum, turned out Mayor Shaw, and elected Judge Bowron (who had flatly condemned the M&M referendum as blatantly unconstitutional).|$|R
5000|$|... ====Unionism==== Like the National Socialists in Germany, the Bolsheviks in Russia courted {{workers to}} join their {{movement}} to help advance benefits and working conditions. Soon after the October Revolution, all independent trade unions and factory committees were made subservient to the new Soviet Union state, essentially nationalizing Russia’s labor movement. According to Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor, {{not only were the}} state-controlled unions no longer autonomous, but workers “do {{not have the right to}} strike,” nor could they elect their own officials without government approval. Gompers accused the Soviet government of “persecution of organized labor”, establishment of a workers’ “State-slavery”, obligatory “80 hour” work weeks, “compulsory labor”, and a Soviet legacy that “constitutes the gravest danger that has confronted labor for centuries.” Compulsory labor was considered, according to Trotsky, “the backbone of Soviet communism.” After the Bolsheviks banned all independent labor unions and closed down the Factory Committees, one unionist “described the unions as ‘living corpses.’” A number of foreign socialist parties have criticized Stalin’s union record. One, the Socialist Party of Great Britain, asserted that after Stalin’s government had brought “the unions under complete State control,” the Soviets were “not to try to improve wages and working conditions but rather to reduce cost, keep wages down and increase production. As a result wages began to fall and working conditions to deteriorate.” The National Socialists in Germany named their party after workers, labeling their political organization the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (NSDAP). During the 1920s the foreign international media simply referred to them as the “National Socialist Labor Party.” Despite their differences, the Nazis and Germany’s communists occasionally worked together on labor issues. In1932, Hitler’s SA brownshirts and the Communist Party of Germany marched together in solidarity with Berlin’s transportation workers, destroying any buses that failed to join the workers’ strike. Hitler often praised workers, once declaring in Völkischer Beobachter that “I only acknowledge one nobility—that of labour.” After Hitler became the German Chancellor in 1933, he declared May Day to be an official paid holiday and arranged celebrations that saw marches, fireworks, and music under the slogan of “Germany honors labor.” Most unions, including the German Free Trade Union, gave their approval and encouraged members to participate. The very next day, Hitler nationalized all autonomous unions. Like the Soviet Union, the National Socialists <b>outlawed</b> <b>strikes,</b> walkouts, and lockouts, adopting the Marxist tenets of prohibiting independent or private institutions. Union membership became compulsory, as reported by Italian historian Gaetano Salvemini, who wrote: “In Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany the official unions have been made compulsory by law, while in the United States, the workers are not legally obligated to join the company unions but may even, if they so wish, oppose them.” Although referring to workers in the Third Reich as “industrial serf,” William Shirer noted that “Hitler and his officials “were accustomed to rant in their public speeches against the bourgeois and the capitalist” in defense of the workers. By June 22, 1938 a special decree established labor conscription, obligating “every German to work where the state assigned him.” These workers could not be fired by business owners without approval by the government employment office, providing job security rarely known during the Weimar Republic. Hitler’s new union, the German Labor Front (DAF) pledged “to create a true social and productive community of all Germans.” Considered an instrument of the Nazi party, the DAF enlarged and developed new social, educational, sports, health, and entertainment programs for German workers via Strength through Joy, which included factory libraries and gardens, periodic breaks, swimming pools, low-priced hot meals, adult education programs, periodic work breaks, physical education, sports facilities, gymnastic training, orchestral music during lunch breaks, free tickets to concerts and opera and subsidized vacations that saw over 10.3 million Germans signed up by 1938 The DAF built two 25,000-ton ocean liners and chartered up to 10 other ships to handle increasing tourism, charging dirt-cheap prices for vacationers on sea or land. For land-based vacations, the DAF built summer resort complexes, the largest located on Reugen island with 20,000 beds.” ...|$|R

[...] That was anathema to the Constitution. Agreeing that the Bill of Rights was not a suicide pact (as the majority had pointed out), Jackson nonetheless concluded that Congress had narrower, just as effective means of preventing the violent overthrow of the government than attempting to regulate thought.

No person of veracity known to Colonel Webb had ever seen Cheseldine, and those who claimed that doubtful honor varied so diversely in descriptions of the chief that they confused the reality and lent to the outlaw only further mystery. Strange to say of an outlaw leader, as there was no one who could identify him, so there was no one who could prove he had actually killed a man. Blood flowed like water over the Big Bend country, and it was Cheseldine who spilled it. Yet the fact remained there were no eye-witnesses to connect any individual called Cheseldine with these deeds of violence. But in striking contrast to this mystery was the person, character, and cold-blooded action of Poggin and Knell, the chief's lieutenants. They were familiar figures in all the towns within two hundred miles of Bradford. Knell had a record, but as gunman with an incredible list of victims Poggin was supreme. If Poggin had a friend no one ever heard of him. There were a hundred stories of his nerve, his wonderful speed with a gun, his passion for gambling, his love of a horse--his cold, implacable, inhuman wiping out of his path any man that crossed it.|$|R

40|$|Flaneur in an Ancient Landscape is a {{photographic}} exhibition commission for Format photography festival in Derby. It was co funded by FORMAT and First Art for Flâneur – New Urban Narratives, Portugal. The work of 25 images {{was shown in}} Derby and Mansfield city centres on 1 Meter Square light boxes and was {{open to the public}} 24 hours a day 7 days a week for 2 exhibitions in 2017. The ancient landscape which includes parts of the medieval Sherwood Forest to the East and borders the Peak District to the West is home to more than 400, 000 people across scores of towns and villages which pepper this land. The myths and legends that have grown out of this region have resonated through the centuries and around the world. Its tales of the green man and outlaws hiding out in the heaths and woodlands, living by their own codes and defying authority, go {{hand in hand with the}} mining communities that have latterly come to define this area of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. The banding together of people to extract a living from the subterranean underworld has not only shaped the landscape but the people above and their camaraderie and community. With the disappearance of the mining industry the spoils of the slagheaps have been regenerated into plantations and the green fingers of the forest rise up once again. I have criss-crossed a diverse landscape of villages, towns, moors, heathlands and woodlands. The images I have created are my response to this area and the people I encountered. The young woman standing outside the cave dwelling with its bricked up windows and doors tells the tale of her great-grandfather and the troglodyte community who once inhabited these spaces. Carved into the sandstone of the Mansfield escarpment they are now hidden from public view and have fallen back into the hands of nature. This seems to symbolise much of the human and industrial heritage of the area which is constantly being abandoned, reclaimed and reborn. Likewise, the image of the young boy with the ‘No Frack’ placard, in the woods takes on some of the exuberant defiance of the ancient forest <b>outlaws</b> or the <b>striking</b> miners, who throughout the centuries have stood up for their beliefs against authoritarian dictates. All the images in this project mix together the people with the mysterious landscape to create a picture of the present intertwined with its layers of rich history...|$|R
