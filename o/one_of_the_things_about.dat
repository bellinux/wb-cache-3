25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I think <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic {{within the framework of the}} drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

6000|$|Some people {{objected to}} spiritualism, table rappings, and such things, {{because they were}} undignified, because the ghosts cracked jokes or waltzed with dinner-tables. I do not share this {{objection}} in the least. I wish the spirits were more farcical than they are. That they should make more jokes and better ones, would be my suggestion. For almost all the spiritualism of our time, {{in so far as}} it is new, is solemn and sad. Some Pagan gods were lawless, and some Christian saints were a little too serious; but the spirits of modern spiritualism are both lawless and serious--a disgusting combination. The specially contemporary spirits are not only devils, they are blue devils. This is, first and last, the real value of Christmas; in so far as the mythology remains at all {{it is a kind of}} happy mythology. Personally, of course, I believe in Santa Claus; but it is the season of forgiveness, and I will forgive others for not doing so. But if there is anyone who does not comprehend the defect in our world which I am civilising, I should recommend him, for instance, to read a story by Mr. Henry James, called [...] "The Turn of the Screw." [...] It is one of the most powerful things ever written, and it is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> which I doubt most whether it ought ever to have been written at all. It describes two innocent children gradually growing at once omniscient and half-witted under the influence of the foul ghosts of a groom and a governess. As I say, I doubt whether Mr. Henry James ought to have published it (no, it is not indecent, do not buy it; it is a spiritual matter), but I think the question so doubtful that I will give that truly great man a chance. I will approve the thing as well as admire it if he will write another tale just as powerful about two children and Santa Claus. If he will not, or cannot, then the conclusion is clear; we can deal strongly with gloomy mystery, but not with happy mystery; we are not rationalists, but diabolists.|$|E

5000|$|Writer J. M.

What he becomes, of course, is not Spider-Man, but what he perceives Spider-Man to be. In a sense, what Kraven becomes is something akin to Frank Miller's Dark Knight character. ... <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> Peter Parker, with Spider-Man, is that he doesn't just put on a mask and become [...] "the Spider-Man." [...] He doesn't become transformed into this dark creature of the night. No matter what costume he has, no matter what he does, Peter Parker is always a very human, passionate, caring guy. Kraven doesn't know that. And that is the major difference here.|$|E
5000|$|The Beatles did {{not concern}} {{themselves}} about possible homosexual undertones {{that go with}} singing a song about boys, although they altered the gender pronouns employed on the Shirelles' version (e.g. [...] "My girl says when I kiss her lips..."). In an October 2005 Rolling Stone interview, Paul McCartney stated: [...] "Any one of us could hold the audience. Ringo would do 'Boys', which was a fan favourite with the crowd. And it was great — though {{if you think about}} it, here's us doing a song and it was really a girls' song. 'I talk about boys now!' Or it was a gay song. But we never even listened. It's just a great song. I think that's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> youth — you just don't give a shit. I love the innocence of those days."

[...] "Batman is in this kind of corrupt city and trying to turn it back into a better place. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> Chicago is Chicago has alleys (which are virtually nonexistent in New York).

In 2012, Dave Barnes {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award for Best Country Song for writing the song [...] "God Gave Me You". In an interview with American Songwriter, Dave stated that [...] "I honestly didn't know I could write songs that could be that universal. Songs that could be that successful. I think <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> that song, as I have looked back on it and sort of examined under the hood, is that the sentiment is pretty universal... The beauty of [...] "God Gave Me You" [...] was that I finally saw what I had done and it opened this really cool door to me being more conscious about writing songs that appeal to more people, and this new record Stories to Tell really showcases that." [...] Stories to Tell, Dave's sixth full studio album, was released on March 13, 2012.|$|E
5000|$|Hill enjoyed {{working with}} Rourke:Mickey understood, before I {{had to tell}} him anything, how to play the part. Which is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> being a director: If you have to explain these things, it'll never work. The casting is the most {{important}} thing you're gonna do in terms of directing the actor. You cast the right person who believes in it and who you feel has an understanding similar to yours. I think people confuse being a motion picture director with being an acting coach. I don't think that I directed him 50 lines in the whole movie. If it's all happening the way you want it to happen, don't put your foot through it. Let it happen. He's got very good instincts. His sense of integrity is such that he's made a lot of choices that have not been in the mainstream. Certainly in American movies. He's a big star in Europe. He's not a big star here, yet. I hope he will become one. All this stuff about him being such a bad boy and all that [...] [...] [...] He's a very romantic fellow, I think. And like a lot of romantic people he's really disappointed by the way the world really works. And out of that disappointment I think sometimes he lashes out. He's not the easiest -- I don't want to make him sound like he's Ozzie Nelson or something. He's not. He does have a lot of emotions. But he's not a difficult fellow to work with."In most cases," [...] Hill says, [...] "producers hope for a huge American box office and treat the European market as a nice little bonus. We're doing the opposite. We're hoping to do respectable business here. But Mickey is a huge star over in Europe. 9 1/2 Weeks and Angel Heart did huge business over there." ...|$|E
5000|$|Many of the on-air announcers {{started their}} career at WOWI. The late Rollie Bristol (d. December 4, 2008) {{went on to}} an active career at WGH and WHRO/WHRV where he did the Art and Rollie Show, later called Rollie Radio. His {{extensive}} knowledge of all things music and his humble approach to sharing his enthusiasm with his friends and listeners gained him a huge following and a deep respect. In speaking with Bob Conwell via a WOWI Reunion Show on K-94's Rare and Imported Tracks in 1981, Rollie said, [...] "There was something about those old days, {{when we had a}} good group of individuals together at the station, because it was all a free-form kind of format. There was nobody saying you’re going to play this, you’re going to play that—it was all up to our own musical judgment as to what got played. And {{there was a lot of}} work involved in that effort. We really listened to the music, trying to find what was good, no matter what kind of music it was. We had a lot of meetings where we got together and talked about what we were playing and if we thought someone was playing too much of one kind of thing, or maybe not enough, we tried to remedy that. Our goal was to provide an overall balanced sound. There was a certain element of excitement in creating a program as you go—live on the air. There was something about the late 60s and early 70s that was happening at the time in music. There was a whole realm of great, exciting music coming out on top of each other—a whole mushrooming of creative music—progressive type music of all kinds. BC—I think a lot of it is still coming out. It just doesn’t get played. Rollie, “That could be. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> WOWI as that we tried to give exposure to relatively unknown things”. BC “You can count stations that do that now on less than one hand”.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} not made. Instead Hill wrote and {{directed}} a second biopic, Wild Bill (1995). This too had little critical or commercial success. Hill reflected on his career in 1995:I think every director thinks that he hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, `Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.Hill admitted his style of films were becoming less fashionable:I admire a lot of what's going on out there, but the oversize kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films are perceived to be vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there...
