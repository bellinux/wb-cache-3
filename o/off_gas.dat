5|$|The Belgian Army was {{stretched}} from Cadzand south to Menen {{on the river}} Leie, and west, from Menin, to Bruges without any sort of reserves. With {{the exception of a}} few RAF sorties, the air was exclusively under the control of the Luftwaffe, and the Belgians reported attacks against all targets considered an objective, with resulting casualties. No natural obstacles remained between the Belgians and the German Army; retreat was not feasible. The Luftwaffe had destroyed most of the rail networks to Dunkirk, just three roads were left: Bruges–Torhout–Dixmude, Bruges–Ghistelles–Nieuport and Bruges–Ostend–Nieuport. Using such axes of retreat was impossible without losses owing to German air supremacy (as opposed to air superiority). Water supplies were damaged and cut <b>off,</b> <b>gas</b> and electricity supplies were also cut. Canals were drained and used as supply dumps for whatever ammunition and food-stuffs were left. The total remaining area covered just 1,700km², and compacted military and civilians alike, of which the latter numbered some 3 million people. Under these circumstances Leopold deemed further resistance useless. On the evening of 27 May, he requested an armistice.|$|E

In October the city shut <b>off</b> <b>gas</b> and water, in part because of an old boiler which would not survive another winter; the electricity remained on during this time. The city set about to make immediate repairs to prevent the building from deteriorating structurally. The work included the installation of Plexiglas windows to keep further moisture out, the installation of a green awning on the east facade which wraps around to the south slightly, and repairs to the parapet wall.|$|E

25|$|Crystallization {{and washing}} of {{melamine}} generates {{a considerable amount}} of waste water, which is a pollutant if discharged directly into the environment. The waste water may be concentrated into a solid (1.5–5% of the weight) for easier disposal. The solid may contain approximately 70% melamine, 23% oxytriazines (ammeline, ammelide, and cyanuric acid), 0.7% polycondensates (melem, melam, and melon). In the Eurotecnica process, however, there is no solid waste and the contaminants are decomposed to ammonia and carbon dioxide and sent as <b>off</b> <b>gas</b> to the upstream urea plant; accordingly, the waste water can be recycled to the melamine plant itself or used as clean cooling water make-up.|$|E
25|$|Earthquake warning {{systems could}} {{potentially}} give people {{time to take}} cover {{in the event of}} a quake, preventing injuries caused by falling debris, automatically stopping trains or shutting <b>off</b> <b>gas</b> lines. The system being developed at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory (called ShakeAlert) in conjunction with the United States Geological Survey, the California Institute of Technology and the University of Washington, will eventually cover the entire West Coast. The system would cost $80 million in funding to run for five years in California, or $120 million for the whole West Coast. In December 2014, United States Congress approved a $5 million allocation as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 in order to expand funding for development of the system.|$|E
25|$|A {{day after}} Russia cut <b>off</b> <b>gas</b> flows to Ukraine, Gazprom accused Ukraine of {{stealing}} gas. On January 3, Naftogaz {{issued a statement}} saying that it would take the necessary gas from volumes that were bound for Europe as technical gas, at a rate of 23 mmcm (million cubic meters) a day. It argued that this was the amount specified in the last transit contract signed in 2002, which covered 2003–2013. The Ukrainian President's representative for energy issues said that problems for Europe would arise within 10 days without gas volumes necessary for maintaining pressure in the pipeline system. However a Gazprom spokesman defined taking technical gas from Russian volumes as stealing, and announced that Gazprom would take the matter to international arbitration court in Stockholm; in a press release on January 4 he claimed that 50 mmcm of gas had already been stolen this way.|$|E

25|$|On January 2, a {{day after}} Russia cut <b>off</b> <b>gas</b> {{supplies}} to Ukraine, Hungary, Romania and Poland were the first countries to report that pressure in their pipelines had fallen. Bulgaria reported that their supply was also falling and that transit to Turkey, Greece and Macedonia was affected. Two days later the Czech Republic and Turkey reported drops in pipeline pressure. Starting on January 7, several countries began to report a significant drop in gas supplies from Russia. Throughout the crisis many countries were unprepared and had been left without supplies for days, leading to significant economic and humanitarian consequences; Bulgaria was forced to stop production in some of its important industrial plants, while one country, Slovakia, {{declared a state of}} emergency. The most severely effected countries were in Southeastern Europe, most of which rely completely on Russia for gas and at the time didn't have sufficient alternative energy sources. However North-West Europe wasn't much effected by the cutoff and none of Europe's major markets came close to cutting off customers. Many European countries had made investments since the 2006 crisis which put them in a better position.|$|E
500|$|Industrial activities, {{which had}} little regulation, created {{substantial}} air pollution. The practice of burning <b>off</b> <b>gas</b> pockets in new oil fields was common, thus increasing the problem. As the Houston area {{came to be}} the most heavily industrialized area in the state, it accumulated the most serious air quality issues. By the 1950s, airline pilots were able to use lines of haze in the air to navigate into the city. Though air quality in urban areas has since improved, [...] Texas remains the leading producer of greenhouse gases in the United States, and [...] NASA ranks Houston as having the worst air quality in the nation (though other sources rank the city somewhat better).|$|E
500|$|The lungs of today's {{terrestrial}} vertebrates {{and the gas}} bladders of today's {{fish are}} believed to have evolved from simple sacs, as outpocketings of the esophagus, that allowed early fish to gulp air under oxygen-poor conditions. These outpocketings first arose in the [...] bony fish. In most of the ray-finned fish the sacs evolved into closed <b>off</b> <b>gas</b> bladders, while a number of carp, trout, herring, catfish, and eels have retained the physostome condition with the sack being open to the esophagus. In more basal bony fish, such as the gar, bichir, bowfin and the lobe-finned fish, the bladders have evolved to primarily function as lungs. The lobe-finned fish gave rise to the land-based tetrapods. Thus, the lungs of vertebrates are homologous to the gas bladders of fish (but not to their gills).|$|E

The dispute began in 2008 {{with a series}} of failed negotiations, and on January 1 Russia cut <b>off</b> <b>gas</b> supplies to Ukraine. On January 7 the dispute turned to crisis when all Russian gas flows through Ukraine were halted for 13 days, completely cutting off supplies to Southeastern Europe, most of which depends on Russian gas, and partially to other European countries.|$|E

On 5 January 2008, Gazprom warned Ukraine that it would reduce its gas supplies on 11 January if $1.5billion in gas debts were not paid.
