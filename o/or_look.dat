5|$|After the 1972Summer Games, Brundage {{retired as}} IOC president. Accounts of Brundage's {{state of mind}} in his {{retirement}} differ. IOC director Berlioux stated that Brundage {{would come to the}} Château de Vidy and take telephone calls <b>or</b> <b>look</b> at correspondence, waiting for Lord Killanin to turn to him for help. According to Berlioux, Brundage sometimes called her from Geneva and asked her to go there. The two would spend hours wandering the streets, saying little. Brundage's longtime , Frederick Ruegsegger, described a different, tranquil, Brundage, whom he compared to an abdicated Japanese emperor.|$|E

25|$|Later, in Scandinavian folklore, trolls became {{beings in}} their own right, where they live far from human habitation, are not Christianized, and are {{considered}} dangerous to human beings. Depending on the source, their appearance varies greatly; trolls may be ugly and slow-witted, <b>or</b> <b>look</b> and behave exactly like human beings, with no particularly grotesque characteristic about them.|$|E

25|$|Because {{numbers were}} {{different}} for every exchange, callers either had to dial the operator <b>or</b> <b>look</b> {{up the telephone}} number. An example of this was Auckland, New Zealand before the introduction of 111 in the 1960s – the city had 40 exchanges, all with different emergency numbers, and finding the telephone number for the local exchange would require having to search through the city's 500-page telephone directory.|$|E

25|$|A mild {{form of a}} {{cleft lip}} is a {{microform}} cleft. A microform cleft can appear {{as small as a}} little dent in the red part of the lip <b>or</b> <b>look</b> like a scar from the lip up to the nostril. In some cases muscle tissue in the lip underneath the scar is affected and might require reconstructive surgery. It is advised to have newborn infants with a microform cleft checked with a craniofacial team as soon as possible to determine the severity of the cleft.|$|E

25|$|The game uses a basic point-and-click {{interface}} to {{move the}} player around and manipulate the game world. As the player moves the cursor around the screen it can change into different styles depending on the situation; neutral cursor (no interaction is possible), a hand (an item with which the player can interact), a finger (the player can move, turn <b>or</b> <b>look</b> in the direction indicated), a wrench (the player must use an inventory item to initiate interaction), a magnifying glass (an area which can be examined in more detail).|$|E
25|$|There are no {{difficulties}} assigning appropriate sex {{for most}} infants with CAH. Genetic males have normal male genitalia and gonads and simply need hormone replacement. Most virilized females are assigned and raised as girls {{even if their}} genitalia are ambiguous <b>or</b> <b>look</b> more male than female. They have normal ovaries and uterus and potential fertility with hormone replacement and surgery. However, the dilemmas surrounding sex assignment of the most severely virilized XX infants have helped shape our understanding of gender identity and sexual orientation, {{and continue to be}} a subject of debate.|$|E

Susan is a tour guide but seems to spend most of her time at home. She is a terrible cook. This is a homage to Butterflies, in which the male lead is also a dentist called Ben and the rest of the family often have to sneak the food she has prepared into the bin without her noticing.|$|E

25|$|In {{his first}} spell with Real Madrid, Capello once again built a title-winning side {{based on a}} strong defence and an {{efficient}} playing style, but also fielded three strikers – Šuker, Mijatović, and Raúl – while promoting several other promising young players to the first team. A key component of the team's success was the club's new left-back Roberto Carlos, who excelled at making overlapping attacking runs to beat the opposition's defensive line and get {{on the end of}} Hierro's long balls from the back; the role gave him the freedom to either run on goal <b>or</b> <b>look</b> to deliver the ball to one of the team's strikers. He was also criticised in the media, however, for using striker Raúl as a left winger at times.|$|E
25|$|Caesar {{felt that}} it would be much safer far away from Sulla should the Dictator change his mind, so he left Rome and joined the army, serving under Marcus Minucius Thermus in Asia and Servilius Isauricus in Cilicia. He served with distinction, winning the Civic Crown for his part in the Siege of Mytilene. He went on a mission to Bithynia to secure the {{assistance}} of King Nicomedes's fleet, but he spent so long at Nicomedes' court that rumours arose of an affair with the king, which Caesar vehemently denied {{for the rest of his}} life. Ironically, the loss of his priesthood had allowed him to pursue a military career, as the high priest of Jupiter was not permitted to touch a horse, sleep three nights outside his own bed or one night outside Rome, <b>or</b> <b>look</b> upon an army.|$|E
25|$|In Orthodox synagogues, {{the dancing}} is mainly {{carried out by}} men and boys; {{children}} (even young girls) may also dance with their fathers. Women and older girls often have their own dancing circles sometimes with the Torah scrolls, <b>or</b> <b>look</b> on {{from the other side}} of a mechitza (partition), in accordance with the value of tzniut (modesty). In 2014, an Israeli modern Orthodox rabbinical organization called Beit Hillel ruled that women are permitted to dance with a Torah scroll on Simchat Torah. They also recommended in their ruling designating a woman as the kallah Torah, or bride of the Torah, just as a man is designated as the chatan Torah, or groom of the Torah, and making sure there is enough dance space for the women, as well as consulting with the women on the songs that will be sung.|$|E

25|$|The {{largest of}} the Liepāja massacres took place on three days from Monday, December 15 to Wednesday, December 17, 1941. On December 13, Kurzemes Vārds {{published}} an order by Emil Diedrich, the Nazi police in Liepāja, which required all Jews {{in the city to}} remain in their residences on Monday, December 15 and December 16, 1941. The order came from SD headquarters in Riga; whether it was received by Kügler or his deputy, Reichle, was disputed, with both Kügler and Reichle later claiming Kügler was on leave in Germany. The Latvian police began arresting the Jews in the city on the night of December 13 to 14, bringing them to the Women's Prison, where they were confined in the courtyard. There was not enough room for the people, so they were ordered to stand facing towards the wall, and not move, look for relatives, <b>or</b> <b>look</b> at the guards, who beat people and treated them with brutality. There was an old wooden building, a garage, barn, or horse barn, at the beach at Šķēde. Some of the Jews were taken to this building on the evening of Sunday, December 14.|$|E
25|$|Police {{officers}} found a {{fire extinguisher}} and squirted its foam into {{the wounds of}} an injured occupant. Other occupants were thrown down the stairs head-first. Eventually, they dragged all occupants into the ground-floor hall, where they had gathered dozens of prisoners {{from all over the}} building in a mess of blood and excrement. They threw her on top of two other people. They were not moving, and Lena Zuhlke drowsily asked them if they were alive. They did not reply, and she lay there on her back, unable to move her right arm, unable to stop her left arm and her legs twitching, blood seeping out of her head wounds. A group of police officers walked by, and each one lifted the bandana which concealed his identity, leaned down and spat on her face. Many victims of the raid were taken to the San Martino hospital, where police officers walked up and down the corridors, slapping their clubs into the palms of their hands, ordering the injured not to move around <b>or</b> <b>look</b> out of the window, keeping handcuffs on many of them and then, often with injuries still untended, shipping them across the city to join scores of others, from the Diaz school and from the street demonstrations, detained at the detention centre in the city's Bolzaneto district.|$|E

[...] Likewise, Leda of Galneryus and Deluhi claims he was not even interested in music until a friend played him X Japan and Luna Sea, and also declared X Japan's music his [...] "Bible". American musician Marty Friedman called X Japan the biggest band in visual kei and [...] "by far the most versatile musically," [...] and cited them as the reason he got into Japanese rock music.|$|E
