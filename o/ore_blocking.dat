Determination {{of the impact of}} mining bench height on the recovery of ore, including the estimation of dilution and ore loss, is critical to the economics of the operation. Conditional simulation was used to derive a number of gold estimation scenarios within a typical volume of the deposit. These scenarios were interrogated for a selection of mining bench heights and <b>ore</b> <b>block</b> dimensions. The results were reported as a range of grade tonnage relationships and compared to the kriged resource model. This allowed the resource model to be calibrated to a specific mining bench height and <b>ore</b> <b>block</b> size. Once calibrated, more realistic dilution and ore loss values for a number of mining bench heights were calculated from the resource model.

These vein inter-sections commonly contain greater relative amounts of early-stage pyrite, suggesting that metal ratio work in combination with detailed mapping of mineral abundances along strike of a vein could significantly assist {{in the evaluation of}} the exploration potential. The vein-scale metal zoning appears to document the parallel evolution of fluid-controlling structures which developed synchronously with the evolving hydrothermal system. For ex-ample, the wider middle portion of the cymoid-curved Coco vein dominantly contains para-genetically early pyritic mineralization, whereas the thinner distal ends dominantly contain paragenetically later sphalerite-galena mineralization; this is an evolution seen in other vein districts such as Freeland-Lamartine, Colorado.

The results indicate that ore shoots are of two dis-tinct types: (1) subhorizontal pitching ore shoots and (2) moderately to steeply pitch-ing ore shoots.

40|$|The mining {{industry}} is increasingly oriented towards large scale mining and the planning concept of "Just in Time", which means activities starting and ending {{as late as}} possible without jeopardising production. The buffers, consisting of production blocks and development ahead of production, are then minimi. This, however, leads to a larger dependency {{on the quality of}} the output from the production systems. The Kiruna mine, Sweden, is a large scale mine and has a number of potential <b>ore</b> <b>blocks</b> with a content that varies in quality (Fe, P, K) and in quantity (ore tonnage). Ore production is restricted by operative and block sequencing constraints as well as by production requirements. A computerized planning model, based on operations research (multi period scheduling) has been developed to meet future demands on ore qualities and quantities. The model uses long range objectives, but can satisfy temporary short range demands without jeopardising the long range goals. A sub-optimal plan, made using the model, has been compared with a truly optimal plan. It is shown that, due to the unreliable information concerning the ore, the sub-optimal plan performs as well as the optimal one. The simulation process that was developed for this comparison is also used to estimate the need for production buffer blocks. Another buffer planning model is developed to determine when development work should take place in order to minimize the risk of additional costs, caused by an inability to start production on time. This algorithm considers the uncertainties in activity durations and is based on a Monte Carlo simulation using project networks and estimates the optimum development buffer.

The general {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the use of geostatistical techniques to obtain improved ore grade estimates. More specific objectives of this study are listed as follows. 1) To compare the geostatistical method with the more traditional inverse distance squared method (IDS). 2) To outline the ore distribution and AI 2 O 3 per cent concentration within each 50 x 50 m mining block and the associated error of estimation, using the kriging method of estimation. 3) To estimate the total insitu ore tonnage and metal recoverable, with associated confidence limits, using the theory of normal and lognormal distribution. 4) To classify the ore grades into various categories, using the geostatistical approach. Within the thesis, horizontal variograms are developed for all variables (AI 2 O 3 per cent, thickness, accumulation, concretion factor, Fe 2 C> 3 per cent, SiC> 2 per cent and TiC> 2 per cent), to assist in interpretation of the geological structures within the mineralization and to quantify mineralization continuity and degree of isotropy.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{developing}} an iron ore mine from exploration data through to informed mining decisions {{provides an example of}} a Complex Adaptive System. The detailed composition of an ore body (expressed as a “block model ” of regularly spaced rectangular blocks) has to be estimat-ed from initially sparse exploration data, based upon a limited number of drill holes. As planning proceeds, the data may be enriched by appropriately selected infill drilling. Once mining com-mences, the block model is further enhanced by assay results obtained from the ore as it is mined. <b>Ore</b> <b>blocks</b> have to be selected, and then sequenced with the aim of producing a steady flow of ore having consistent marketable grade, consistent not only in iron content but also in the major contaminants, particularly silica, alumina and phosphorus. Information at each stage of planning and implementation is gathered from a range of natural, technical, economic and financial envi-ronments, and interpreted through a dynamic network of interactions between these environ-ments. The process is highly adaptive in as much as fairly complete plans must be made before any mining commences, but these plans will require adjustment in response to steadily increasing knowledge of the ore body, unforeseen technical problems and changes in the financial and eco-nomic conditions under which the mine is planned and subsequently operated. Central to the planning process is a block model of the prospect, comprising probabilistic data as to the prospect’s composition.

The re-processing of the old 3 D seismic data using new imaging techniques, such as 3 D Kirchhoff prestack time migration (KPSTM), has led to better imaging of the ore body, structures (faults and dikes), and steeply dipping stratigraphy. Detailed interpretations of the highly auriferous Ventersdorp Contact Reef (VCR) using advanced complex seismic trace and horizon - based seismic attributes, have led to discoveries of <b>ore</b> <b>blocks</b> (1 km long and 250 m wide) that are bound by multi-fault segments of the first-order scale Bank and West Rand faults, leading to an increase of the resource portfolio and potentially, the quantity of the reserves. In particular, the edge detection attributes have resolved faults with throws as small as 10 m and complex structural architectures such as intersecting and cross-cutting faults, and fault bifurcations which are difficult to detect using conventional techniques (e. g., amplitude, dip and azimuth). Potential conduits, such as faults and dikes for migration of water and methane into underground workings were also mapped using edge detection attributes. These results have the potential to play into safe mine planning. The interpretation of the merged 3 D seismic datasets, integrated with underground maps, boreholes, absolute and relative geochronological data, has added {{to our understanding of the}} gross structural architecture and Neoarchaean tectonic evolution of the goldfields. On a first-order scale (400 m - 2. 5 km) the data resolved: (1) the northerly-trending disharmonic Libanon Anticline with a wavelength of 8 km and amplitude of 2 km, which was formed during deformation in the Umzawami Event (ca 2. 73 Ga); and (2) the north-northeast trending, west-dipping (65 °– 70 °W) listric West Rand and Bank faults, which were formed during a major extensional event, herein termed the Hlukana- Platberg Event (2. 70 - 2. 64). On a second-order scale (25 m - 400 m) the datasets resolved: (1) the Tandeka and Jabulani thrusts 1. 5 km below the West Rand and Bank faults in the depth interval of 6 - 8 km; and (2) a series of drag synclines and rollover anticlines in the immediate footwall and hangingwall of the West Rand and Bank faults. Further to this, the seismic sections across the goldfields provided evidence that the first- and second-order scale faults, thrust and folds were dissected, eroded and overlain by the Transvaal Supergroup above an angular unconformity. The oldest approximate age for the Transvaal Supergroup is given as 2. 58 Ga, thus constraining the age of the faults, thrust and folds to the Neoarchaean or pre- 2. 58 Ga...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic fills {{are quite}} popular as {{backfilling}} materials for underground voids {{created in the}} process of mining. For ease of transport through pipes, they are placed in the form of slurry and allowed to settle freely under self weight. Stopes can be approximated as rectangular prisms, and may extend as high as 200 metres. The horizontal access drives, used for transporting the <b>ore,</b> are <b>blocked</b> by porous barricade bricks before backfilling. Failures of barricades, and subsequent in-rush of wet hydraulic fill into the mines, have claimed several lives and contributed to severe economic loss world-wide. The objective of this research is to carry out a thorough experimental study of the hydraulic fills and barricade bricks, with particular emphasis on load-deformation and drainage characteristics. Two separate numerical models were developed in FLAC and FLAC 3 D, to simulate the backfilling process and to monitor the pore water pressure developments, fill and water heights and discharge rates. So far, the findings of the research were disseminated through four journal papers, a book chapter and seven papers in refereed international conferences. Overall, this study will improve the current state-of-the-art in hydraulic filling of mine stopes significantly. More than 25 different hydraulic fills, from five different mines, were studied. All Australian hydraulic fills fall within a narrow band of grain size distribution and are classified as silty sands or sandy silts. Their specific gravity values range from 2. 8 to 4. 5. Constant head and falling head tests were carried out on reconstituted samples, produced from the hydraulic fill slurry, in a process that replicates the sedimentation process in the mine. The hydraulic fills settled to a porosity of 37...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} preliminary {{research on}} the application of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to Real Option Valuation (ROV) and the optimization of mine scheduling. The MDP framework is a novel approach to option valuation and scheduling in mining operations. A learning agent is introduced into the valuation process of an open pit, where prices and <b>block</b> <b>ore</b> grades have probabilistic values. The prices are modeled using a mean reverting diffusion process and the block grades using sequential Gaussian simulation. The agent is asked to learn which production parameters {{should be used in}} order to maximize the overall value of the project. The introduction of the agent permits a real option approach to mine valuation, such that the value associated with the robustness of a design to uncertainty can be measured. A simulated example is used in which there are 10 blocks to be extracted under conditions of grade and price uncertainty. Using policy iteration, an optimal policy is generated and the value of production options is found. The potential financial gains from applying MDPs to mine valuation and optimization are substantial and warrant further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{demands for}} more {{effective}} utilization of ore bodies and proper risk {{management in the}} mining industry {{have resulted in a}} new cross discipline called geometallurgy. Geometallurgy connects geological, mineral processing and subsequent downstream processing information together to provide a comprehensive model to be used in production planning and management. A geometallurgical program is the industrial application of geometallurgy. It provides a way to map the variation in the ore body, to handling the data and giving metallurgical forecast on spatial level. Three different approaches are used in geometallurgical programs. These include the traditional way, which uses chemical elements, the proxy method, which applies geometallurgical tests, and the mineralogical approach using mineralogy. The mineralogical approach provides the most comprehensive and versatile way to treat geometallurgical data. Therefore it was selected as a basis for this study. For the mineralogical method, quantitative mineralogical information is needed both on deposit and for the process. The geological model must describe the minerals present, give their chemical composition, report their mass proportions (modal composition) in the ore body and describe the texture. The process model must be capable of using mineralogical information provided by the geological model to forecast the metallurgical performance of different geological volumes (samples, <b>ore</b> <b>blocks,</b> geometallurgical domains or blends prepared for the plant) and periods (from minutes via hourly and daily scale to week, monthly and annual production). A literature survey showed that areas, where more development is needed for using the mineralogical approach, are: 1) quick and inexpensive techniques for reliable modal analysis of the ore samples; 2) textural classification of the ore capable to forecast the liberation distribution of the ore when crushed and ground; 3) unit operation models based on particle properties (at mineral liberation level) and 4) a system capable to handle all this information and transfer it to production model. This study focuses on solving the first and the third problem. A number of methods for obtaining mineral grades were evaluated with a focus on geometallurgical applicability, precision and trueness. The method survey included scanning electron microscopy based automated mineralogy, quantitative X-ray powder diffraction with Rietveld refinement, and element-to-mineral conversion. A new technique called combined method uses both quantitative X-ray diffraction with Rietveld refinement and the element-to-mineral conversion method. The method not only delivers the required turnover for geometallurgy, but also overcomes the shortcomings if X-ray powder diffraction or element-to-mineral conversion when used alone. Furthermore, various methods of obtaining modal mineralogy were compared and a model for evaluating precision and closeness of the methods was developed. Different levels of processing models can be classified in geometallurgy based on in which level the ore, i. e. the feed stream to the processing plant, is defined and what information subsequent streams carry. For mineral processing models the following five levels can be distinguished: particle size only level, elemental level, element by particle size level, mineral level, mineral by particle size level and mineral liberation (particle) level. The most comprehensive level of mineral processing models is the particle-based one which includes all necessary information for modeling unit operations. Within this study, as the first step, a unit operation model is built on particle level for wet low-intensity magnetic separation. The experimental data was gathered through a survey of the KA 3 iron ore concentrator plant of Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB (LKAB) in Kiruna. The first wet magnetic separator of the process was used {{as the basis for the}} model development since the degree of liberation is important at this stage. Corresponding feed, concentrate and tailings streams were mass balanced on a mineral by size and liberation level. The mass balanced data showed that the behavior of individual particles in the magnetic separation is depending on their size and composition. The model, which has a size dependent by-pass parameter and a separation parameter dependent of the magnetic volume of the particle, is capable of forecasting the behavior of particles in magnetic separation. Modeling and simulation show the benefits that particle-based simulation provides compared to lower level process models which take into account only elemental or mineral grades.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} the geostatistical {{evaluation of a}} disseminated nickel or body which contains remnants of high grade vein mineralization. The problems of dealing with high grade outliers are discussed together with the difficulties of modelling the semi-variograms. Methods for the validation of the variogram odels are presented prior to their use in a geometrically and geologically controlled kriging procedure to estimate recoverable <b>blocked</b> <b>ore</b> reserves. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a case history example from a disseminated nickel de-posit which demonstrates simple ways of dealing with: (a) selectivity; (b) reconciliation of geo-statistical estimates and geological estimates; (c) high grade outliers. The large block V can be subdivided into 16 small blocks v. The mean grade of the large block is 1. 10 % and the grades of the constituent small blocks are shown in Fig. 1. The results of applying various cut-off grades to the large and the small blocks are shown in Table 1. Selectivity At the planning stage of mine evaluation, data are generally available on a relatively large grid but reserve estimates are required on a signifi-cantly smaller scale. For example, the average drilling grid in a nickel orebody may be 30 m (between sections) x 15 m (on sections). Average grades can be estimated for 30 m x 15 m x 5 m (bench height) blocks to provide an in situ re-serve estimate. However, if the minimum blast-ing width (mining selection) in the orebody is 5 m, then recovery will be on the basis of the estimated grades of 5 m x 5 m x 5 m blocks. Cut-off grades must not be applied to the original in situ estimates unless they are adjusted to take into account the size of the units on which selection above the cut-off grade will be made. The problem is illustrated by the simple exampl...|$|R
40|$|As ore grades have {{decreased}} and the mining depth has {{increased over the}} past few decades, other characteristics than ore grade and tonnage are becoming important. The underground mining process, from in-situ rock mass characteristics to the final mill product with fully liberated minerals, consists of a chain of unit operations that impact, and are influenced by, fragmentation. This report presents the baseline mapping of the project “From Face to Surface”, studying the effects of fragmentation on the process flow in an underground SLC mine. It analyses the underground unit operations in detail, from mine planning to shafts, and maps the blast fragmentation’s effect on the process flow. The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of fragmentation´s effect on different unit operations. The objective is to describe the mining operation at Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB (LKAB) and identify key areas for improving fragmentation. To understand how fragmentation influences different operations in the mine, the project conducted a literature study, collected data and interviewed mine personnel in LKAB’s Malmberget mine. Data were collected from the mine’s internal systems, such as GIRON, WOLIS, IP 21 and a local drilling data system. The interviews were conducted in cooperation with research personnel from the mine. This baseline mapping shows that the mining operation in Malmberget is affected by fragmentation in several ways. For some unit operations, the fragmentation has a large impact, while for others, it has none at all. The influence of fragmentation starts with the loading operation after the initial blasting and ends with the crushing operation. For the former, boulders are the largest problem, as they cause a great deal of idle time, either when they have to be moved to a separate drift for secondary blasting or when they create hang-ups in the ore passes. When boulders are dumped into the ore passes, they risk damaging the ore pass walls. If boulders create a hang-up, it has to be removed. If the hang-up must be removed with explosives, there is a risk of further damaging the ore pass. In addition, the toxic fumes created by the explosives hinder production until the pass is ventilated. Finally, hang-ups affect the transportation operation as the trucks cannot use an <b>ore</b> pass <b>blocked</b> by a hang-up or closed for ventilation of toxic fumes. There is also a slight possibility that a boulder which does not get stuck in the ore pass will get stuck on a truck. The last operation affected by fragmentation is crushing; boulders and large fragments risk creating a hang-up in the crusher. There are no reports of problems related to fragmentation after this point. The results suggest that further work and mine trials are required in the following areas: drilling, loading, ore passes and crushers. Godkänd; 2016; 20160607 (anngus...|$|R
40|$|Browns Creek is a skarn that hosts an Au-Cu {{ore deposit}} in the Blayney region of New South Wales, Australia. Skarn rock at this {{location}} is wollastonite marble, highly mineralized by sulfides and gold deposited as native Au, electrum, telluride minerals and within arsenopyrite crystals. Related alteration includes metasomatized hornfels of the Ordovician Blayney Volcanics and marbleized interbedded limestone lenses of the Cowriga Limestone Member. Magmatic fluids {{responsible for this}} alteration were derived from a Silurian felsic-intermediate multi-phase intrusive system, the Browns Creek Intrusive Complex. Main constituents of this intrusive system include the Carcaor Granodiorite, the first and largest phase responsible for main pluton emplacement and skarnification of country rock, and the Mine Dyke Group, which is a smaller and more felsic phase attributed to carrying the ore-bearing fluids deposited at Browns Creek. As a small mine {{that is no longer}} operational, Browns Creek offers an example of an economic deposit that has not been thoroughly studied. This honors thesis aims to use petrological and geochemical analyses to better understand the conditions associated with gold deposition at Browns Creek by focusing on host rocks and metallic minerals deposited outside of the primary <b>ore</b> zone. polished <b>blocks</b> and thin sections were prepared for petrographic and microprobe analysis in order to more fully comprehend mineralogical processes occurring here, and supporting evidence was found for striking results presented by the most recent study on this site. These results include the assignment of Browns Creek as a skarn-hosted ore deposit resulting from a magmatic event post-alteration rather than a true skarn deposit, in addition to the re-dating of Browns Creek Intrusive Complex—presenting a Silurian age ~ 15 Ma older than previously understood. These notable distinctions are investigated here through different approaches than previously explored. Additionally, links are proposed between Browns Creek deposit characteristics and tectonic regime, assigning primary Au-Cu ore deposition to a Silurian volcanic arc environment while suggesting that anomalously occurring Sn mineralization {{is the result of a}} later Devonian event within a rifting environment...|$|R
