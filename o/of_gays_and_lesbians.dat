25|$|Ridge & Feeney (1998) {{have studied}} a group <b>of</b> <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> in Australian universities. Results {{showed that the}} {{frequency}} of attachment styles in {{the gay and lesbian}} population was the same as in the heterosexual; at the same time attachment styles have predicted relationship variables in a similar way as in the heterosexual population. However, gay and lesbian adult attachment styles were not related to childhood experiences with parents. Contradicting this last result, Robinson (1999) has found that in the lesbian population there was a link between attachment styles and early parenting. However, unlike in heterosexual females, attachment style was related to participant's relationship with their fathers.|$|E

25|$|The festival {{was first}} held on Father's Day in 1975. Deacon Maccubbin, {{owner of the}} LGBT bookstore Lambda Rising, {{organized}} the city's first annual gay pride event. It was a one-day community block party held on 20th Street NW between R and S Streets NW in Washington, D.C. (the same block where Lambda Rising was then located). Two vending trucks, one loaded with beer and another with soft drinks, served the crowd. About 2,000 people attended and visited about a dozen organizational booths and vendors. In a surprising political move indicative of the growing political power <b>of</b> <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> in the city, several candidates for the D.C. City Council also attended and shook hands for several hours.|$|E
25|$|On February 7, 2012, a {{three-judge panel}} on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 2–1 {{majority}} opinion affirming the judgment in Perry v. Schwarzenegger, which declared Proposition 8 unconstitutional, saying it violated the Equal Protection Clause. The opinion, written by Judge Stephen Reinhardt and joined by Judge Michael Hawkins, states that Proposition 8 did nothing more than lessen the status and dignity <b>of</b> <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians,</b> and classify their relationships and families as inferior to those of opposite-sex couples. The court found {{that the people of}} California, by using their initiative power to target a minority group and withdraw the right to marry they once possessed under the California State Constitution, violated the federal Constitution.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{relationship}} between homosexuality and religion can vary greatly across time and place, within and between different religions and sects, and regarding different forms of homosexuality and bisexuality, current authoritative bodies and doctrines of the world's largest religions generally view homosexuality negatively. This can range from quietly discouraging homosexual activity, to explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices among adherents and actively opposing social acceptance of homosexuality. Some teach that homosexual orientation itself is sinful, others state that only the sexual act is a sin, others are completely accepting <b>of</b> <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians,</b> while some encourage homosexuality. Some claim that homosexuality can be overcome through religious faith and practice. On the other hand, voices exist within many of these religions that view homosexuality more positively, and liberal religious denominations may bless same-sex marriages. Some view same-sex love and sexuality as sacred, and a mythology of same-sex love can be found around the world.|$|E

25|$|Brown {{was one of}} four African Americans in the Assembly in 1964. He {{continued}} to be reelected to the Assembly until 1995. In the 1960s, Brown served as the Chair of the Legislative Representation Committee, a powerful Assembly position that helped Brown climb the Assembly ranks. He became the Democrats' Assembly whip in 1969. Brown also served on the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. In 1972, he delivered a speech at the Democratic National Convention. He lost his bid for the speakership in 1972. In 1975, Willie Brown authored and lobbied the successful passing of the Consenting Adult Sex Bill that legalized homosexuality in California, thus earning the strong and lasting support of San Francisco's gay community. Similarly, he voted against AB 607, which banned same-sex marriage in 1977, further building his reputation as a supporter of the civil rights <b>of</b> <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians.</b> During the 1970s, Brown {{continued to}} expand his legal practice, including the representation of several major real estate developers. He won the Speakership in 1980 with 28 Republican and 23 Democratic votes.|$|E
25|$|A {{retirement}} haven {{throughout the}} area's history, senior citizens {{came to live}} in the Coachella Valley: a large percentage of residents are age 65 or older. Though the area is somewhat politically conservative, it is nevertheless renowned for being a community that is known for its inclusion <b>of</b> <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> as part of a diverse community. Current estimates are that up to 33% of Palm Springs' residents identify as gay and lesbian. Cathedral City is also home to a number of gay resorts, bars, restaurants and clubs. Many establishments along a stretch of Arenas Road in downtown Palm Springs are gay-oriented and serve as the center of the annual White Party. According to an interview with former Palm Springs mayor Ron Oden, perhaps at the time the United States' only openly gay African-American mayor, a large number of HIV/AIDS-infected individuals have moved to the Palm Springs area {{to take advantage of the}} extensive health-support systems that have been developed in recent years (such as the Desert AIDS Project.) For this reason, the area has one of the highest per capita rates of HIV/AIDS in the nation.|$|E
