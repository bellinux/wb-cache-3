40|$|Abstract — With {{the goal}} to provide {{ubiquitous}} wireless In-ternet access, large-scale deployment of <b>outdoor</b> public <b>access</b> networks will continue {{at a rapid}} pace in the next years. In <b>outdoor</b> environment, connecting <b>access</b> points (APs) via cables is costly and {{requires a lot of}} cabling engineering work. Therefore, the multihop-augmented network architecture has become an option of upsurging interest. This paper investigates how to deploy APs in an <b>outdoor</b> public <b>access</b> network to improve throughput and quality-of-service (QoS) while extending the coverage by multihop communications. Frequency planning is suggested to improve user throughput with QoS provisioning, and to make the multihop network more scalable to facilitate cov-erage extension. To investigate the overall tradeoffs among QoS, throughput, and coverage, we develop an analytical throughput and delay model for this multihop network using the carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) medium access control (MAC) protocol. This model also considers bidirectional asymmetric traffic for users operating in the unsaturated situation. Then, we apply an optimization approach to determine the optimal number of APs in a cluster and the best separation distances between APs, aiming to maximize the capacity and coverage of a cluster of APs subject to the delay requirement.

The proposed CAP device is consisted of a cable modem (CM) and a wireless local area network (WLAN) access point (AP) to be integrated inside the chassis of an existing outdoor CATV amplifier. The main purpose of the CAP device is to effectively extend the coverage of <b>outdoor</b> wireless <b>access</b> link and to further provide a data access-efficient service for construction of a ubiquitous networking environment in the metropolitan area. Besides, to ensure the safety and validity for data accessing and information exchanging in the wireless broadband network, a security certifying mechanism of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) is also integrated in the CAP device. The experimental results show that the performance and robustness of the CAP devices is suitable for ubiquitous network applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the issues of}} deploying access points for wireless local area networks (WLANs) in an outdoor environment, where several adjacent access points (APs) will form a cluster and in each cluster access points are connected through wireless repeaters to ease deployment. Access points are usually placed aiming to maximize its cell coverage. Nevertheless, a larger coverage distance {{will lead to a}} lower throughput for the wireless repeater. We apply the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization approach to determine the number of access points in a cluster and the best separation distance between access points. The objective is to maximize the ratio of the total carried traffic load to the total cost for a cluster of APs connected by wireless repeaters. In this paper, the uniform-spacing and the increasing-spacing placement strategies for access points are proposed and compared. Our results show that the increasing-spacing placement strategy outperforms the uniform-spacing placement strategy in terms of an objective function considering total carried traffic load, the number of access points, and the cost connecting an AP to the backbone network.
