5|$|In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt {{declared}} December 15 to be Bill of Rights Day, {{commemorating the}} 150th {{anniversary of the}} ratification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights. In 1991, the Virginia copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights toured the country in honor of its bicentennial, visiting the capitals of all fifty states.|$|E
5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection of some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights {{to state and local}} governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E

5|$|Black's most {{prominent}} ideological opponent on the Warren Court was John Marshall Harlan II, who replaced Justice Jackson in 1955. They disagreed on several issues, including the applicability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights to the states, {{the scope of}} the due process clause, and the one man, one vote principle.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{provisions}} of section 29 are plainly {{similar to those of}} the Sixth Amendment, namely the Information Clause, the Assistance of Counsel Clause, and the Compulsory Process Clause. The Sixth Amendment (and the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights) had not yet been ratified at the time of the Crimes Act's passage.|$|E
5|$|Section 25 {{was not a}} more {{significant}} source of criminal appeals in large part becauseas Barron v. Baltimore (1833) heldthe Bill of Rights (including its criminal procedure provisions) was viewed as inapplicable to the state governments. This continued until the incorporation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights after {{the adoption of the}} Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E

5|$|The Due Process Clause prohibits {{state and}} local {{government}} officials from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without legislative authorization. This clause has also been used by the federal judiciary to make most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights applicable to the states, as well as to recognize substantive and procedural requirements that state laws must satisfy.|$|E
5|$|The Senate edited these {{amendments}} still further, making 26 {{changes of}} its own. Madison's proposal to apply parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights {{to the states}} as well as the federal government was eliminated, and the seventeen amendments were condensed to twelve, which were approved on September 9, 1789. The Senate also eliminated the last of Madison's proposed changes to the preamble.|$|E
5|$|The Seventh Amendment {{guarantees}} jury {{trials in}} federal civil cases {{that deal with}} claims of more than twenty dollars. It also prohibits judges from overruling findings of fact by juries in federal civil trials. In Colgrove v. Battin (1973), the Court ruled that the amendment's requirements could be fulfilled by a jury {{with a minimum of}} six members. The Seventh {{is one of the few}} parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights not to be incorporated (applied to the states).|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court of the United States issued {{almost no}} {{constitutional}} criminal procedure decisions {{for its first}} century of existence. Professor Akhil Amar highlights two reasons for this. First, the Court's decision in Barron v. Baltimore (1833) meant that the federal constitution did not apply in state proceedings until the incorporation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights after the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, the Court lacked general appellate jurisdiction over federal criminal cases until 1891.|$|E
5|$|This {{language}} was greatly condensed by Congress, {{and passed the}} House and Senate with almost no recorded debate, complicating future discussion of the Amendment's intent. The First Amendment, {{along with the rest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights, was submitted to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789, and adopted on December 15, 1791.|$|E
5|$|George Washington had {{fourteen}} handwritten copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights made, one for Congress and one {{for each}} of the original thirteen states. The copies for Georgia, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania went missing. The New York copy is thought to have been destroyed in a fire. Two unidentified copies of the missing four (thought to be the Georgia and Maryland copies) survive; one is in the National Archives, and the other is in the New York Public Library. North Carolina's copy was stolen from the State Capitol by a Union soldier following the Civil War. In an FBI sting operation, it was recovered in 2003. The copy retained by the First Congress has been on display (along with the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence) in the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom room at the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. since December 13, 1952.|$|E

It solves this topic both from <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Czech accounting and the International accounting represented in IFRS. The first part concentrates on <b>the</b> legal aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange, like sorts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange, their requirements, expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amount. The second part deals with <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Czech accounting rules related to <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange from 1993 till the present time. The source for this are the Czech accounting manuals, which were valid between the years 1993 - 2003. The thesis documents <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> their comprehension and their accounting solution. The third part {{concentrates on the}} current accounting rules represented in Czech accounting standards (CAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards...|$|R
5|$|However, {{during the}} 1960s, the Court under Chief Justice Warren took the process much further, making almost all {{guarantees}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights binding upon the states. Thus, although the Court failed to accept Black's theory of total incorporation, {{the end result}} of its jurisprudence is very close to what Black advocated. Today, the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not been extended to the states are the Third and Seventh Amendments, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive bail, and the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted, that criminal juries be composed of 12 members and be unanimous in their verdicts.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, the Taft Court {{laid the}} groundwork for the {{incorporation}} of many of the guarantees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights to be applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. In Gitlow v. New York, the court by a 6–2 vote with Taft in the majority, upheld Gitlow's conviction on criminal anarchy charges for advocating the overthrow of the government; his defense was freedom of speech. Justice Edward T. Sanford wrote the court's opinion, and both majority and minority (Holmes, joined by Brandeis) assumed that the First Amendment's Free Speech and Free Press clauses were protected against infringement by the states.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of the ACLU {{were divided}} on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties. Felix Frankfurter felt that {{legislation}} was the best long-term solution, because the Supreme Court could not (andin his opinionshould not) mandate liberal interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights. But Walter Pollack, Morris Ernst, and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties. A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, {{and there was a}} growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.|$|E

5|$|Petit {{jury and}} venue provisionsboth {{traceable}} to enumerated complaints in the Declaration of Independenceare included in Article Three of the United States Constitution. More criminal procedure provisions {{are contained in}} the United States Bill of Rights, specifically the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments. With {{the exception of the}} Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment, and (maybe) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment, all of the criminal procedure provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights have been incorporated to apply to the state governments.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment {{guarantees}} {{the rights of}} freedom of speech and peaceable assembly, among others. While not explicitly mentioned, the Supreme Court has held that the right to assembly includes the freedom of association, particularly political association. These protections not only prohibit the government from passing laws which infringe upon these rights, but also from taking actions which would violate them. While the Bill of Rights—which includes the First Amendment—applied originally only to the federal government, the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed for the application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights to the states under the incorporation doctrine.|$|E
5|$|The Second Amendment {{protects the}} {{individual}} {{right to keep}} and bear arms. The concept of such a right existed within English common law long before the enactment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights. First codified in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 (but there only applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.|$|E

50|$|The {{shipowner}} {{is further}} secured by the stipulation {{that if the}} total freight payable under <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading {{is less than the}} full chartered freight, the difference is paid to the shipowner before the vessel sails. Sometimes a difficulty arises, notwithstanding these precautions: even though the charter-party gives an ample lien, <b>the</b> terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading may be insufficient to preserve the same extensive lien as against <b>the</b> holder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading. <b>The</b> shippers under <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading, if they are not the charterers, are not liable for the chartered freight, but only for <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading freight. Unless <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading expressly reserves it, they are not subject to a lien for the chartered freight. The master may guard against this difficulty by refusing to sign <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading that do not preserve the shipowner's lien for full chartered freight. However a difficulty often arises from an improvident clause in the charter-party that requires him to sign <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading as presented. See Kruger v. Moel Tryvan, 1907 A. C. 272.|$|R
