40|$|Incorporating {{the values}} of the {{services}} that ecosystems provide into decision making is becoming increasingly common in nature conservation and resource management policies, both locally and globally. Yet with limited funds for conservation of threatened species and ecosystems there is a desire to identify priority areas where investment efficiently conserves multiple ecosystem services. We mapped four mangrove ecosystems services (coastal protection, fisheries, biodiversity, and carbon storage) across Fiji. Using a cost-effectiveness analysis, we prioritised mangrove areas for each service, where the effectiveness was a function <b>of</b> the <b>benefits</b> provided to the local communities, and the costs were associated with restricting specific uses of mangroves. We demonstrate that, although priority mangrove areas (top 20 %) for each service can be managed at relatively low opportunity costs (ranging from 4. 5 to 11. 3 % of overall opportunity costs), prioritising for a single service yields relatively low co-benefits due to limited geographical overlap with priority areas for other services. None-the-less, prioritisation of mangrove areas provides greater <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> than if sites were selected randomly for most ecosystem services. We discuss deficiencies in the mapping of ecosystems services in data poor regions and how this may impact upon the equity of managing mangroves for particular services across the urban-rural divide in developing countries. Finally we discuss how our maps may aid decision-makers to direct funding for mangrove management from various sources to localities that best meet funding objectives, as well as how this knowledge can aid in creating a national mangrove zoning scheme...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes and {{illustrates}} {{the use of}} a new approach to benefit transfer for the non-market valuation of environmental resources. It treats transfer as an identification problem that requires assessing whether available benefit estimates permit the parameters of a preference function to be identified. The transfer method proposed uses these identifying restrictions to calibrate preference parameters and bases the benefit estimates on that preference function. The approach is illustrated using travel cost, hedonic and contingent valuation estimates, as well as combinations of estimates. It has three potential advantages over conventional practice: (1) it allows multiple, potentially <b>overlapping</b> estimates <b>of</b> the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> an improvement in environmental quality to be combined consistently; (2) it assures the transferred estimates <b>of</b> the <b>benefits</b> attributed to a proposed change can never exceed income; and (3) it provides a set of additional "outputs" that offer plausibility checks <b>of</b> the <b>benefit</b> transfers. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{collaborative}} work is gaining rapid acceptance {{in almost all}} disciplines of numerous organizations in the world like financial institutions, educational institutions, and business organizations (Ancona, 1990; Bettenhausen, 1991; Gallucci, 1985). Switzer and Shriner (2000) were of the view that students are the most obvious party who benefit from collaborative group work among students, faculty members, and the community. According to them there are four <b>overlapping</b> types <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> for students. These are: 1) immediate educational benefits, 2) immediate social benefits, 3) critical thinking benefits, and 4) long-term career benefits. Research suggests that Face to Face (FTF) interaction in collaborative learning does not solve the communication problems in Arabic culture due to religious and cultural factors. It is necessary to think of an alternative that would respect the general scope of collaborative work (in terms of its multisided but interactive effect) but favour women's involvement in sharing and communicating information with their male fellows. This can be fulfilled {{through the use of}} Computer mediated communication (CMC). This study will build on previous IT & collaborative learning related researches...|$|R
50|$|In {{some parts}} of European {{countries}} apart of the European Union (EU), local regulations gives consumers {{a minimum of two}} years warranty on hardware defects that existed at time <b>of</b> purchase, which <b>overlaps</b> the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> AppleCare. This effectively means that, in certain countries in the EU, an AppleCare Protection Plan still extends phone/Internet support from 90 days on all devices. In most countries the onus under the EU law is on the merchant to establish that a hardware defect did not exist at time of purchase {{for the first six months}} after purchase. After the six-month-period this is reversed, meaning that the customer needs to establish that a hardware defect did exist when they received the product. Unlike the statutory guarantee AppleCare also covers defects that appeared after purchase, if the device was handled correctly.|$|R
40|$|Communication {{has a role}} {{of heart}} {{in all kinds of}} {{educational}} interactions, with the popularization of computer technology for home and office use, teaching methods have changed communication styles from plain lectures to multimedia presentations. These new trends in education are in their infancy, online learning or E-learning, and are quickly becoming an important aspect of education in our future around the world. In spite of easy availability of new multimedia support, still the uses of technological tools of communication in the educational fields are in their initial stages, in the under developing countries like Oman. We have yet to fully experience the transformative effects of these mediums, particularly on web based learning. Group work activities are another main point or task in the high education. Switzer and Shriner [20] were of the view that students are the most obvious party who benefit from group work among students, faculty members, and the community. According to them there are four <b>overlapping</b> types <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> for students. These are: 1) immediate educational benefits, 2) immediate social benefits, 3) critical thinking benefits, and 4) long-term career benefits. Different researchers were of the opinion that face to face communication will not solve the empowerment problems in group work activities. As, through FTF interaction male dominant role can be produced due to identity of speaker, eye contact, nodding, moving the hands, and facial expressions etc. In this situation suitable adoption of technology can be consider as an alternative mode of communication, where there is a chance of discrimination. This case study will be a further step in addition to the previous technological tools & group work related researches. In this researcher will try to explore that how suitable technological tools can play a role to overcome the group work problems and to increase the performance {{of the students in the}} developing countries like Oman...|$|R
40|$|Black {{carbon and}} organic carbon {{particles}} emitted from combustion sources interact with sunlight and can impact climate change processes. These particles {{also contribute to}} visibility impairment and to elevated ambient levels of fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5). For black carbon in particular, measures to reduce climate-forcing emissions often would have collateral benefits by reducing emissions of health-related pollutants, and vice versa. A better characterization of worldwide emissions of climate forcing and health-related pollutants is needed to improve the understanding <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> <b>benefits</b> for emission reduction strategies both in the U. S. and abroad. The improved characterization of emissions will help in two ways: by quantifying the most efficient strategies for improving both global warming and health-related problems, and by identifying sources that are under-reported or missing from different emissions inventories. The {{purpose of the current}} research is to identify tools {{that can be used to}} improve emissions inventories for black carbon and organic carbon particles in the U. S. and abroad. Emission factors and tools used in current inventories for these pollutants are reviewed, and factors are compiled and developed for emission source categories that are not adequately covered in current inventories...|$|R

40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) of the {{subthalamic nucleus}} (STN) {{is used to}} relieve motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. A tripartite system of STN subdivisions serving motoric, associative, and limbic functions was proposed, mainly based on tracing studies, which are limited by low numbers of observations. The evidence is compelling and raises {{the question as to}} what extent these functional zones are anatomically segregated. The majority of studies indicate that there is anatomical overlap between STN functional zones. Using ultrahigh-resolution magnetic resonance imaging techniques it is now possible to visualize the STN with high spatial resolution, and it is feasible that in the near future stereotactic guided placement of electrical stimulators aided by high-resolution imaging will allow for more specific stimulation of the STN. The neuroanatomical and functional makeup of these subdivisions and their level <b>of</b> <b>overlap</b> would <b>benefit</b> from clarification before serving as surgical targets. We discuss histological and imaging studies, as well as clinical observations and electrophysiological recordings in DBS patients.

40|$|The {{idea that}} the {{internet}} enables disparate individuals to link together easily has focused attention on characterising collective action under these circumstances. My research looks instead at a situation which mixes the disparate and those united by various forms of shared identity, and material grievance. The case I focus on involves <b>overlapping</b> groups <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> claimants: disabled people, carers and older people. These groups are under-represented online and their political activity in a digital environment has rarely been researched. The context of my research is a consultation over social care, which provoked a campaign of opposition and the posting online of nearly 3, 000 comments on the green paper’s executive summary. This constitutes collective action because it was undertaken for a collective purpose: to defend disability benefits from a perceived threat. In order to take the focus I want, I develop a conceptual framework that includes all three drivers of collective action that feature in social psychology models - efficacy, injustice and identity. Much comparable research considers {{just one or two}} of these drivers. My analytical approach is primarily inductive but I employ a mixed-methods design, including digital tracing, inductive thematic coding and basic statistical analysis. The data is drawn from the campaign and the comments. I find that most of the comments exhibit a shared sense of injustice. They also frequently include expressions of collective identity made with reference to various groups, rather than to one overarching group. Personal narratives often accompany these collective expressions. The campaign messages spread horizontally among varied, but mostly pre-existing, forums, social networking sites and blogs. The mobilisation also had a vertical element due to the involvement of private company acting, in a hybrid manner, as a campaigning organisation. My research contributes to knowledge by showing that when online action includes people who are motivated by collective identity, traditional and more contemporary collective action processes do not simply co-exist: there is a dynamic interplay between them. It also demonstrates the value of focusing on lower-level networks. This shows that the role of the drivers can vary among the groups of actors involved and, where the drivers combine, they have a reinforcing tendency...|$|R

40|$|Objective　To {{study the}} <b>overlapping</b> <b>of</b> {{involved}} organs in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) {{occurring in the}} Chinese naval servicemen, {{and to provide a}} sound basis for its diagnosis and treatment. Methods　From November 2006 to April 2007, a questionnaire survey was conducted in 8600 officers and soldiers of Chinese naval force in three regions using randomized, stratified, multistage sampling method. All respondents completed the Rome Ⅲ Modular Questionnaire. The collected data were double input by EpiData 3. 02 software and analyzed by SPSS 13. 0 software. Results　 7454 valid questionnaires were retrieved. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> was 46. 7 % involving two to five sites. In two-site <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> FGIDs, the incidence <b>of</b> <b>overlap</b> functional gastroduodenal disorder (FGD) and functional bowel disorder (FBD) was shown to be highest (51. 2 %, 339 / 662), followed by the <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> functional esophageal disorder (FED) and FBD (15. 4 %, 102 / 662). In three-site <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> FGIDs, the <b>overlapping</b> rate <b>of</b> FED, FGD and FBD was the highest (44. 4 %, 151 / 340), followed by that of FGD, FBD and functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS) (20. 3 %, 69 / 340). The commonest four-site <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> FGIDs included FED, FGD, FBD and FAPS (57. 7 %, 94 / 163). The five-site <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> FGIDs was the combination of FED, FGD, FBD, FAPS and functional anorectal disorder (FAD). The incidence of FGIDs in southern military region was 49. 8 % (987 / 1983), which was higher than that of northern (31. 8 %, 1064 / 3351) and eastern (23. 8 %, 533 / 2240) regions. The incidence of FGIDs of single organ was 44. 9 % in southern military region, which was lower than 59. 0 % in eastern and 58. 4 % in northern region. The incidence of the illness involving two to five sites were higher in southern military region as compared with that of eastern and northern regions. Conclusions　The rate <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> <b>of</b> FGIDs at different sites is common in the Chinese naval servicemen. There is a difference in rate <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> between different military areas. More attention should be paid to the prevention and treatment <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> organs in FGIDs in the Chinese naval servicemen...|$|R
