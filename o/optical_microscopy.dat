5|$|Thermotropic mesophases are {{detected}} and {{characterized by}} two major methods, the original method was use of thermal <b>optical</b> <b>microscopy,</b> {{in which a}} small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.|$|E
25|$|Correlation {{functions}} are typically measured with scattering experiments. For example, x-ray scattering experiments directly measure electron-electron equal-time correlations. From knowledge of elemental structure factors, {{one can also}} measure elemental pair correlation functions. See Radial distribution function for further information. Equal-time spin–spin correlation {{functions are}} measured with neutron scattering as opposed to x-ray scattering. Neutron scattering can also yield information on pair correlations as well. For systems composed of particles larger than about one micrometer, <b>optical</b> <b>microscopy</b> {{can be used to}} measure both equal-time and equal-position correlation functions. <b>Optical</b> <b>microscopy</b> is thus common for colloidal suspensions, especially in two dimensions.|$|E

Three pathologists blinded to histology evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of <b>optical</b> coherence <b>microscopy</b> images to differentiate normal from neoplastic renal tissues. Results Optical coherence tomography and <b>optical</b> coherence <b>microscopy</b> images of normal kidney revealed architectural features, including glomeruli, convoluted tubules, collecting tubules and loops of Henle. Each method of imaging renal tumors clearly demonstrated morphological changes and decreased imaging depth. Optical coherence tomography and microscopy features matched well with the corresponding histology. Three observers achieved 88 %, 100 % and 100 % sensitivity, and 100 %, 88 % and 100 % specificity, respectively, when evaluating normal vs neoplastic specimens using <b>optical</b> coherence <b>microscopy</b> images with substantial interobserver agreement (κ = 0. 82, p < 0. 01). Conclusions Integrated optical coherence tomography and <b>optical</b> coherence <b>microscopy</b> imaging provides coregistered, multiscale images of renal pathology in real time without exogenous contrast medium or histological processing.

40|$|Maximum {{likelihood}} {{image restoration}} {{is a powerful}} method for three-dimensional (3 D) computational <b>optical</b> sectioning <b>microscopy</b> of extended objects. With punctate specimens, however, this method produces a few very bright isolated spots and dim detail around them is lost. The commonly used regularization methods (sieves and roughness penalty) decrease the amplitude of the bright spots, but do not avoid loosing dim detail. We derived an intensity regularization that decreases the amplitude of bright spots without loosing dim detail. In contrast with other regularization methods, this method does not increase significanlty the computational complextity of the estimation algorithm.

25|$|The {{halogen lamp}} reduces uneven {{evaporation}} of the filament and eliminates darkening {{of the envelope}} by filling the lamp with a halogen gas at low pressure, rather than an inert gas. The halogen cycle increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents its darkening by redepositing tungsten {{from the inside of}} the bulb back onto the filament. The halogen lamp can operate its filament at a higher temperature than a standard gas filled lamp of similar power without loss of operating life. Such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs, and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space. Fiber-optic lamps for <b>optical</b> <b>microscopy</b> is one typical application.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to identifying {{rocks in the}} field (lithology), petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory. Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through <b>optical</b> <b>microscopy</b> and by using an electron microprobe. In an optical mineralogy analysis, petrologists analyze thin sections of rock samples using a petrographic microscope, where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light, including their birefringence, pleochroism, twinning, and interference properties with a conoscopic lens. In the electron microprobe, individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals.

25|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>microscopy</b> and {{electron}} microscopy involve the diffraction, reflection, or refraction of electromagnetic radiation/electron beams {{interacting with the}} specimen, and {{the collection of the}} scattered radiation or another signal in order to create an image.

Scanning probe microscopy involves the interaction of a scanning probe with the surface of the object of interest. The development of microscopy revolutionized biology, gave rise to the field of histology and so remains an essential technique in the life and physical sciences.|$|E

40|$|Pathways to <b>optical</b> STED <b>microscopy</b> <b>Optical</b> {{far-field}} <b>microscopy</b> such as confocal {{fluorescence microscopy}} {{is a very}} popular technique for investigating the living cell. Unfortunately, its spatial resolution is limited to around 200 nm, impeding the imaging of small molecular as-semblies. Recent decades have seen the development of op-tical nanoscopy, <b>optical</b> far-field <b>microscopy</b> with a spatial res-olution down to molecular scales. STED microscopy {{was the first of}} such nanoscopy techniques. Despite the fact, that it in principle only requires the addition of a strong STED laser to a conventional microscope, STED nanoscopy was for a long time considered as a very complex technique, impos-sible to be applicable as a turn-key technique in everyday biological research. However, recent years has seen impor-tant improvements of the STED nanoscopy approach which have significantly simplified the setup. These developments mainly followed from optimization of fluorescent labels, laser technology and optical simplifications. As a result, STED mi-croscopy setups have got more compact and have been re-alized on commercial instruments, allowing access to less-experienced users in open imaging facilities. Here, we give a brief overview of the recent improvements in STED mi-croscopy that made these important developments possible...|$|R
25|$|Nano-FTIR (nanoscale Fourier {{transform}} infrared spectroscopy) is a {{scanning probe}} technique {{that can be}} considered as a combination of two techniques: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scattering-type scanning near-field <b>optical</b> <b>microscopy</b> (s-SNOM). As s-SNOM, nano-FTIR is based on atomic-force microscopy (AFM), where a sharp tip is illuminated by an external light source and the tip-scattered light (typically back-scattered) is detected as a function of tip position. A typical nano-FTIR setup thus consists of an atomic force microscope, a broadband infrared light source used for tip illumination, and a Michelson interferometer acting as Fourier transform spectrometer. In nano-FTIR, the sample stage is placed in one of the interferometer arms, which allows for recording both amplitude and phase of the detected light (unlike conventional FTIR that normally does not yield phase information). Scanning the tip allows for performing hyperspectral imaging (i.e. complete spectrum at every pixel of the scanned area) with nanoscale spatial resolution determined by the tip apex size. The use of broadband infrared sources enables the acquisition of continuous spectra, which is a distinctive feature of nano-FTIR compared to s-SNOM.|$|E
25|$|OsO4 is {{a widely}} used {{staining}} agent used in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to provide contrast to the image. As a lipid stain, it is also useful in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) {{as an alternative to}} sputter coating. It embeds a heavy metal directly into cell membranes, creating a high electron scattering rate without the need for coating the membrane with a layer of metal, which can obscure details of the cell membrane. In the staining of the plasma membrane, osmium(VIII) oxide binds phospholipid head regions, thus creating contrast with the neighbouring protoplasm (cytoplasm). Additionally, osmium(VIII) oxide is also used for fixing biological samples in conjunction with HgCl2. Its rapid killing abilities are used to quickly kill live specimens such as protozoa. OsO4 stabilizes many proteins by transforming them into gels without destroying structural features. Tissue proteins that are stabilized by OsO4 are not coagulated by alcohols during dehydration. Osmium(VIII) oxide is also used as a stain for lipids in <b>optical</b> <b>microscopy.</b> OsO4 also stains the human cornea (see safety considerations).|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{mechanism}} of actin filament initiation by Arp2/3 has been disputed. The question {{is where the}} complex binds the filament and nucleates a [...] "daughter" [...] filament. Historically two models have been proposed. [...] Recent results, and the balance of opinion in the field, favour the side branching model, in which the Arp2/3 complex binds {{to the side of}} a pre-existing ("mother") filament at a point different from the nucleation site. Although the field lacks a high-resolution crystal structure, data from electron microscopy, together with biochemical data on the , favour side branching. [...] In the alternative barbed end branching model, Arp2/3 only associates at the barbed end of growing filaments, allowing for the elongation of the original filament and the formation of a branched filament.
