30|$|The in- and <b>out-degrees</b> of nodes are {{important}} factors in shaping the network topology. We applied our topological construction to devise invariants for any directed networks. We compute the Euler characteristic on a sequence of sub-networks defined by directed degeneracy of their nodes, or in other words the in- and <b>out-degrees</b> of the vertices, as described in detail in the Methods section. Two separate sequences are defined because in- and <b>out-degrees</b> represent different aspects in the network connectivity. The sequences of sub-networks of a given network are a filtration {{in the sense that}} each network appearing in the sequence is contained in all those that follow. The values of the Euler characteristic for each network of the sequences gives rise to two separate sequences of integers that give a measure of the shape and the topology of the complete network. We propose this invariant to describe general directed networks.|$|R

40|$|Many massive graphs (such as the WWW graph and Call graphs) share certain {{universal}} characteristics {{which can}} be described by the so-called "power law.

In particular, we give three increasingly general directed graph models and one general undirected graph model for generating power law graphs by adding at most one node and possibly one or more edges at a time. We will show that for any given edge density and desired power laws for in-degrees and <b>out-degrees,</b> not necessarily the same, the resulting graph will almost surely have the desired edge density and the power laws for the in-degrees and <b>out-degrees.</b> Our most general directed and undirected models include nearly all known power law evolution models as special cases.

40|$|We study optimal {{synchronization}} {{of networks}} of coupled phase oscillators. We extend previous theory for optimizing the synchronization properties of undirected networks to the important case of directed networks. We derive a generalized synchrony alignment function that encodes {{the interplay between}} network structure and the oscillators' natural frequencies and serves as an objective measure for the network's degree of synchronization. Using the generalized synchrony alignment function, we show that a network's synchronization properties can be systematically optimized. This framework also allows us to study the properties of synchrony-optimized networks, and in particular, investigate the role of directed network properties such as nodal in- and <b>out-degrees.</b> For instance, we find that in optimally rewired networks the heterogeneity of the in-degree distribution roughly matches the heterogeneity of the natural frequency distribution, but no such relationship emerges for <b>out-degrees.</b> We also observe that a network's synchronization properties are promoted by {{a strong correlation between}} the nodal in-degrees and the natural frequencies of oscillators, whereas the relationship between the nodal <b>out-degrees</b> and the natural frequencies has comparatively little effect. This result is supported by our theory, which indicates that synchronization is promoted by a strong alignment of the natural frequencies with the left singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular values of the Laplacian matrix...|$|R

30|$|Just {{like the}} network of {{patients}} in close enough proximity for MRSA transmission, the unit network is not static. Indeed, private clinics can change their id numbers in the data. This phenomenon gives, effectively speaking noise to our measurements. With more consistent information about which units that split and merge, or change id number, we could model the system more accurately. Our results do still give a lower bound of the structural effects of the patient flow. Another option would be to break the network into shorter time segments during which the set of units is more stable (cf. Ref. [22]), but those segments cannot be too short - then they would not cover the infrequent links that could be {{very important for the}} size of an outbreak [23]. The network structure of the unit network is characterized by a skewed distribution of in- and <b>out-degrees,</b> but far from as broad distributions as power-laws (that are known to have low epidemic thresholds [16], [17]).

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{technique}} 2 ̆ 6 amp;# 8212;Compressed Adjacency Matrices 2 ̆ 6 amp;# 8212;for visualizing gene regulatory networks. These directed networks have strong structural characteristics: <b>out-degrees</b> with a scale-free distribution, in-degrees {{bound by a}} low maximum, and few and small cycles. Standard visualization techniques, such as node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices, are impeded by these network characteristics. The scale-free distribution of <b>out-degrees</b> causes {{a high number of}} intersecting edges in node-link diagrams. Adjacency matrices become space-inefficient due to the low in-degrees and the resulting sparse network. Compressed adjacency matrices, however, exploit these structural characteristics. By cutting open and rearranging an adjacency matrix, we achieve a compact and neatly-arranged visualization. Compressed adjacency matrices allow for easy detection of subnetworks with a specific structure, so-called motifs, which provide important knowledge about gene regulatory networks to domain experts. We summarize motifs commonly referred to in the literature, and relate them to network analysis tasks common to the visualization domain. We show that a user can easily find the important motifs in compressed adjacency matrices, and that this is hard in standard adjacency matrix and node-link diagrams. We also demonstrate that interaction techniques for standard adjacency matrices can be used for our compressed variant. These techniques include rearrangement clustering, highlighting, and filtering...|$|R
