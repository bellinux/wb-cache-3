5000|$|In a 2008 report written {{after the}} study, the Regional Council {{suggested}} that future tolling programs (and by extension, VMT programs) could better protect participants’ privacy through {{a choice of}} two different mileage recording approaches. [...] Participants could either enroll in the “thin client” or “thick client” operating approaches. The thin client would use an on-board toll meter where all raw data {{was transferred to the}} tolling office. In the office, the data would be processed and the road segments would be recognized and matched with toll rates. In the thick client approach, the tolling process would take place in the <b>on-board</b> <b>unit.</b> After the road section was recognized, the toll rate would be processed in the <b>on-board</b> <b>unit</b> according to the type of the road, time period, and vehicle class. The road information could then be sent to the tolling office in aggregate form. Under this approach, specific road details would never be stored in the toll system office. If the fee was calculated in the <b>on-board</b> <b>unit,</b> it would also be possible to integrate a card slot into the <b>on-board</b> <b>unit</b> for usage of stored value card to pay the fee. Because the prepaid card would have no identifying information (as opposed to a credit card), this method would achieve maximum privacy for the participants.|$|E

5000|$|Oregon’s 2012 VMT fee {{pilot study}} offered five plans, {{each with a}} {{different}} technology option and payment method depending on the drivers’ privacy preferences. [...] Drivers had the choice to report miles using a smartphone, a global positioning system (GPS) device, or a simple reporting device with no GPS technology; or, they could opt out of using technology altogether by paying a flat rate {{in lieu of a}} per-mile fee. [...] But even those drivers who chose to report their miles using a smartphone or a GPS were not releasing their exact location coordinates and times of travel. These <b>on-board</b> <b>units</b> were programmed to contain just enough intelligence and knowledge of map boundaries to accumulate and transfer to the billing entity the miles per region or zone, as opposed to exact location. Likewise, the <b>on-board</b> <b>units</b> were only programmed to aggregate travel during particular periods, as opposed to during exact times. Negotiations with the American Civil Liberties Union shaped the privacy provisions of Oregon’s recent 2013 legislation, which set up the forthcoming 2015 VMT program. [...] Section 9 of the bill limits who has access to the data and requires those who have access—including private sector vendors—to protect it. [...] Furthermore, the data is destroyed 30 days after it is required for payment processing or dispute resolution.|$|R
50|$|Toll Collect {{oversees the}} toll {{collection}} {{on behalf of}} the Federal Republic of Germany (Toll Collect, 2007). Toll Collect has developed an automatic log-on system for truckers, based on a combination of GSM and GPS. To take advantage of the automatic log-on, lorry drivers are required to register the freight company as well as each individual lorry. After registration an <b>on-board</b> <b>unit</b> (OBU) can be installed by an authorized Toll-Collect partner. The OBU automatically determines the distance travelled on the toll route, calculates the toll based on vehicle class and toll rate information entered and transmits the information to the Toll-Collect centre for processing via GSM (cellular) communication (Richards, 2006). Once the toll information has been submitted to the Toll-Collect centre a bill is generated and e-mailed to the driver or owner of the lorry. The German government paid for the approximately 450,000 OBUs currently in use and lorry drivers were responsible for covering their installation (UK Commission for Integrated Transport 2007).|$|E

3000|$|In {{vehicular}} ad hoc networks (VANETs), <b>on-board</b> <b>units</b> (OBUs) give vehicles {{the ability}} of communication to make them [...] "smart objects" [...] more than mere transportation tools.

Both modes of communication can be performed using the same ad hoc wireless communication technology, such as IEEE 802.11 p [1]. By using VANETs, many new services for intelligent transport systems can be enabled, and numerous opportunities for safety and efficiency improvements are created.|$|R

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to verify the faults tolerance of the European Train Control System (ETCS) <b>on-board</b> <b>unit</b> even if these faults are uncommon.

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} to formalize {{different}} kinds of tests for a railway system. The common theme of the test scenarios {{is the goal of}} performing them in a reference laboratory. One line of tests concern the ETCS system, starting with specification conformity of the <b>on-board</b> <b>unit.</b> These tests are extended to address interoperability of different components of the ETCS system, and then to the validation of operational serviceability. The other line of tests aims to establish the interoperability of track-side equipment. The formalization concept for the ETCS tests starts with the conformity tests of the <b>on-board</b> <b>unit,</b> which itself is fully specified. Interoperability and serviceability address the unit's interaction with other equipment. This involves coping with systems in the test which are only partially defined. This is a feature of even more importance in the treatment of track-side interoperability. Overall, it is shown how a variety of different techniques is needed to cope with the challenge of fully attaining meaningful test results...|$|E
