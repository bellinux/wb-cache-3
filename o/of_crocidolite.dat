40|$|SUMMARY. The {{oxidation}} <b>of</b> amosite, <b>crocidolite,</b> and biotite {{has been}} determined attemperatures up to nearly 9 o 0 ~ under both a vacuum (IO- ~ mm Hg) and oxygen (io and 600 mm Hg). Infrared spectra gave the loss of constitutional hydroxyl under these conditions. The loss of tensile strength of the amphiboles with increasing temperature seems {{to be due to}} thermal decomposition. For the three minerals oxidation takes place progressively over a broad temperature range. Under vacuum there is a certain temperature above which the ferric iron previously formed is reduced; this temperature corresponds to the completion of the loss <b>of</b> hydroxyl. The <b>crocidolite</b> anhydride in the literature is most probably an oxycrocidolite formed by dehydrogenation, the truly dehydroxylated zones being amorphous. W HEN hydrated silicates containing ferrous iron are heated the constitutional hydroxyl decomposes and the iron may also change its valence state. The oxidation may result from either the incorporation of oxygen into the material (oxygenation; Addison and Sharp, 1968) or a dehydrogenation (Brindley and Youell, 1953) : Fe 2 ++ OH [...] -> Fe 3 ++O [...] +H.

The policy encouraged residents to relocate out of Wittenoom voluntarily, through the purchase of their homes, business and property and included a contribution to their relocation costs. The Shire of Ashburton and many local residents were opposed to closing the town; they lobbied hard to have the town cleaned up and developed as a tourist attraction.|$|E
50|$|The Australian Blue Asbestos Company {{employed}} 6,500 men and 500 {{women in}} the mining and milling <b>of</b> <b>crocidolite</b> at Wittenoom between 1943 and 1966. This cohort has been traced periodically for vital status and cause of death since 1975. By 1986 there were 85 deaths from pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma. None occurred within ten years of first exposure to crocidolite. A survey of dustiness in the industry conducted in 1966 has provided a basis for estimates of cumulative crocidolite exposure {{of the members of}} the cohort. Exposure-response relationships have been examined. Mesothelioma incidence rates increase exponentially with time since first exposure and also increase with intensity of exposure to crocidolite. Mathematical modelling of the relationship between mesothelioma incidence and intensity of exposure, duration of exposure and time since first exposure results in an estimate of up to 700 cases of mesothelioma in this cohort by the year 2020.|$|E

Each subject who had died from lung cancer (92), mesothelioma (31), or stomach cancer (17) was matched with up to 20 control subjects {{of the same age}} who were not known to have died before the index subject. Relations of dose and time <b>of</b> exposure to <b>crocidolite</b> to risk <b>of</b> death were modelled by conditional logistic regression. For lung cancer, the best fitting multiplicative model was one which estimated a relative risk (RR) of 1. 12 (95 % CI 1. 04 - 1. 20) per year of exposure and 1. 01 (95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 01) per fibre/ml. This was statistically indistinguishable from an additive model showing an increase in RR of 0. 01045 (95 % CI 0. 008 - 0. 020) per f/ml year. For mesothelioma the best fitting model appeared to be one estimating a RR of 24. 9 (95 % CI 3. 51 - 1. 77) per log year since first exposed and a RR of 10. 5 (95 % CI 3. 12 - 35. 1) if exposed for longer than six months. This was not distinguishable statistically from a model that showed mortality increasing as the fourth power of time since first exposed less the fourth power of time since last exposed.

40|$|Summary. The {{temperature}} at which dehydroxylation ccurs in amphiboles {{i thought to}} be largely dependent {{on the type of}} cation that occupies the M a and M 1 sites. Four amphibole types have been studied in which these sites are occupied, in various proportions, by Mg 2 + or Fe 2 +. The temperature of dehydroxylation, i an inert atmosphere, is shown to rise with increasing Mg 2 + content in these sites. ECENTLY Hodgson (1965) has discussed the relationship between the chemical composition and the temperature of thermal decom-position <b>of</b> some <b>crocidolites.</b> He concluded from d. t. a, evidence that the position of the high temperature endotherm, that is, the tempera-ture at which structural breakdown <b>of</b> the <b>crocidolite</b> occurs, was depen-dent on the Fe 2 +/Mg ~+ ratio, the temperature of the endotherm rising with rising Mg 2 + content. Croeidolite may be unique amongst he amphiboles in that the de-hydroxylation process and the structural breakdown process are con-secutive rather than concurrent (Freeman, 1962). Thus, in seeking correlations between the composition and thermal behaviour of amphi-boles {{it is important to consider}} the temperature of dehydroxylation as well as the temperature of final structural breakdown. In the amphibole structure the hydroxyl group is bonded to the M 3 cation and to the M 1 cations (using Whittaker's (1949) notation). Whittaker (1949) found that in Bolivian crocidolite the MI-OI-I and Ms-OH bond distances were 2 - 10 A. The MI-OH bond distance was 2 - 10 3 ~ and the Ms-OH distance 2. 07 3 ~ in eummingtonite (Ghose and I-Iellner, 1959). I t is to be expected, then, that the strength of the M-OH bond, or the MO-I-I bond (where M represents the cation on the M a or M 1 sites), and consequently the {{temperature at}} which bond breakage occurs, will be dependent on the cations which occupy these sites. In order to show the etteet of site occupancy on stability the temperature of dehydroxylation of four amphibole types has been determined. Experimental results.
