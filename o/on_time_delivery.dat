40|$|Purchasing {{processes}} {{exists in}} all organisations today, and are seldom connected to one department. Instead, several departments {{are included in}} the decisions on what to buy, which can make the process very complex. Dependence relationships occurs between the included departments, and an efficient communication is a prerequisite to achieve high purchasing performance. This thesis is made in collaboration with a purchasing division in a research and development company, which struggles to achieve <b>on</b> <b>time</b> <b>deliveries</b> <b>on</b> their orders. They are to a great extent dependent on information from other departments in the organisation which increases the complexity of their activities. This creates a situation where the buyers have problems to place orders to suppliers <b>on</b> <b>time,</b> which consequently causes late deliveries of the material to the R&D projects. The purpose of this thesis was to improve the purchasing process at the purchasing division in the organisation to be more efficient and contribute to <b>on</b> <b>time</b> <b>deliveries.</b> To achieve this, the process was mapped and analysed to detect areas of improvement, and dependent input from other departments was defined. To fulfil the purpose, empirical data of the current situation was collected through direct observations, semi-structured interviews, and internal documents. Further, to create an understanding of activities in the purchasing process three specific components with different characteristics were studied and analysed. Several wastes could be identified in the processes, they were categorised in their difficulty to be implemented and their effect <b>on</b> the process <b>time</b> and purchasing performance. Suggestions of improvements regarding the processes was produced to reduce the prioritised waste, and the focus were on how to coordinate the interface between Material & Logistics and the other departments, and how the work processes and input could be standardised. The suggestions of improvement made it possible to save time in the processes, these savings were explained and visualised in future state maps. This contributed to an understanding of how the current situation at the organisation could be changed to improve the purchasing process. When compressing time the efficiency can be increased and this gives a better opportunity to reach <b>on</b> <b>time</b> <b>deliveries,</b> which continuously increase the purchasing performance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} lot splitting {{in the context of}} workload control (WLC). Past studies on WLC assumed that jobs released to the shop floor proceed through the different stages of processing without being split. However, in practice, large jobs are often split into smaller transfer sublots so that they can move more quickly and independently through the production process and allow operations overlapping relating to the same job. This paper assesses the performance of different lot splitting policies for job release and dispatching strategies under lot splitting. A new dispatching rule was designed to specifically take advantage of lot splitting and operations overlapping in the context of WLC. Discrete-event simulation is used to assess system performance in relation to the ability to provide shorter <b>delivery</b> <b>times</b> and <b>on</b> <b>time</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Results highlight the importance of releasing the sublots of the same job together and demonstrate that combining an effective lot splitting policy with an appropriate dispatching rule can enhance the performance of production systems...|$|R

The decision involves multiple criteria and if the objectives vary in preference and scope, then nature of decision becomes multiobjective.

The multiobjective problem includes three objectives: minimizing the net price, maximizing the quality, and maximizing the <b>on</b> <b>time</b> <b>deliveries</b> subject to supplier's constraints. The objection function and the demand are treated as intutionistic fuzzy sets. An intutionistic fuzzy set has its ability to handle uncertainty with additional degrees of freedom.

The advantage of IFO is that they give better results than fuzzy/crisp optimization. The proposed approach is explained by a numerical example...|$|R

Whether this is possible against all adversarial queuing theory rate- 1 adversaries was previously posed as an open question [13, 10].
