60|$|The {{garrison}} was not {{a formidable}} one, consisting only of some thirty Portuguese soldiers, whose appearance did not speak much for the discipline maintained. Their uniforms were worn and rusty in the extreme. They were slovenly in appearance, and wore a look of discontent and hopelessness.

They wrote farces of the old type, consisting of complicated intrigues, with which they cleverly interwove the representation of contemporary whims and social oddities. They generally failed when they attempted comedies <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more <b>serious</b> <b>character</b> and tried to introduce <b>a</b> higher sort <b>of</b> emotion. <b>A</b> solitary exception must be made in the case of Froufrou (1869), which, owing perhaps to the admirable talent of Aimée Desclée, remains their unique Succès de larmes.

60|$|It was {{now clear}} that fighting, and that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>character,</b> was to be undertaken.

After passing through the passage they went up a long flight of narrow steps until their course was arrested by a wooden panel. The Fleming applied first his eye and then his ear to a tiny peephole.|$|E

[...] Rouart-Lerolle published the score later in 1916 but by then Satie was moving on to bigger things: his ballet Parade (1917) was in the planning stage and {{towards the end of the}} year he would receive the commission for Socrate (1918). The one-off Neoclassical parody Sonatine bureaucratique (1917) provided what Steven Moore Whiting called [...] "the culmination and also the end of Satie's humoristic piano music."

The mourning she still wore was also partly in conformity with the sad-colored garments of her neighbors, and the necessities of the rainy season.

60|$|These {{and other}} {{circumstances}} {{seem to have}} prompted the promoters of the Cork Exhibition to further efforts {{in the cause of}} lace-making. Towards the close of the year 1883 they made fresh representations to Government, and inquired what forms of State assistance could be given. A number of convents in the neighbourhood of Cork was engaged in giving instruction to children under their care in lace and crochet making. At some, rooms were allotted for the use of grown-up workers who made laces {{under the supervision of the}} nuns. These convents obviously were centres where experiments in reform could be tried. The convents, however, lacked instruction in the designing of patterns for laces. An excellent School of Art was at work at Cork, but the students there had not been instructed in specially designing for lace. If the convents with their workrooms could be brought into relation with this School of Art, it seemed possible that something <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>character</b> might be done to benefit lace-makers, and also to open up a new field in ornamental design for the students at the School of Art. The rules of the Department of Science and Art were found to be adapted to aid in meeting such wants as those sketched out by the promoters at Cork. As the nuns in the different lace-making convents had not been able to attend in Cork to hear Mr. Cole's lectures, they asked that he should visit them and repeat them at the convents. This Mr. Cole did early in 1884, the masters of the local Schools of Art accompanying him on his visits. Negotiations were forthwith opened for connecting the convents with the art schools. By the end of 1885 some six or seven different lace-making convents had placed themselves in connection with Schools of Art at Cork and Waterford. These convents were attended not only by the nuns but by outside pupils also; and, at the request of the convents, Mr. Cole has visited them twice a year, lecturing and giving advice upon designs for lace. The composition of new patterns for lace was attempted, and old patterns which had degenerated were revised and redrawn for the use of the workers connected with the convents. There are now twelve convents, Mr. Cole tells us, where instruction in drawing and in the composition of patterns is given, and some of the students have won some of the higher prizes offered by the Department of Science and Art for designing lace- patterns.|$|E

60|$|Edmund was at {{this time}} {{particularly}} full of cares: his mind being deeply occupied in the consideration of two important events now at hand, which were to fix his fate in life--ordination and matrimony--events <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>character</b> as to make the ball, which would be very quickly followed by one of them, appear of less moment in his eyes than in those of any other person in the house. On the 23rd {{he was going to}} a friend near Peterborough, in the same situation as himself, and they were to receive ordination {{in the course of the}} Christmas week. Half his destiny would then be determined, but the other half might not be so very smoothly wooed. His duties would be established, but the wife who was to share, and animate, and reward those duties, might yet be unattainable. He knew his own mind, but he was not always perfectly assured of knowing Miss Crawford's. There were points on which they did not quite agree; there were moments in which she did not seem propitious; and though trusting altogether to her affection, so far as to be resolved--almost resolved--on bringing it to a decision within a very short time, as soon as the variety of business before him were arranged, and he knew what he had to offer her, he had many anxious feelings, many doubting hours as to the result. His conviction of her regard for him was sometimes very strong; he could look back on <b>a</b> long course <b>of</b> encouragement, and she was as perfect in disinterested attachment as in everything else. But at other times doubt and alarm intermingled with his hopes; and when he thought of her acknowledged disinclination for privacy and retirement, her decided preference <b>of</b> <b>a</b> London life, what could he expect but a determined rejection? unless it were an acceptance even more to be deprecated, demanding such sacrifices of situation and employment on his side as conscience must forbid.|$|R
40|$|Twenty-five {{patients}} with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) {{were treated with}} methylprednisolone (MP) pulse therapy (1 g intravenously on 3 successive days). In all patients renal biopsy was done before or just {{after the start of}} therapy. Pulse therapy was used in all patients in combination with a low oral maintenance dose of prednisone. In 21 patients additional immunosuppressive treatment was given, either cyclophosphamide (n = 19) or azathioprine (n = 2); in 2 patients plasmapheresis was also applied. Sixteen of the 25 patients were dialysis-dependent at presentation; 11 <b>of</b> them improved, <b>an</b> additional 3 had a temporary recovery, but needed maintenance renal replacement therapy after 5 - 46 months, mean 22 months. Nine of the 25 patients were not dialysis-dependent, 6 <b>of</b> them improved, <b>an</b> additional one had a temporary recovery, but needed chronic dialysis after 35 months. When many irreversible glomerular lesions were present, the effectiveness of MP pulse therapy was limited or only <b>of</b> <b>a</b> temporary <b>character.</b> <b>Serious</b> side effects did not occur.

[...] "What," [...] said the D.D., with some appearance of incredulity, [...] "Bunyan a commentator--upon Genesis!! Impossible! Well, I never heard of that work of the good Bunyan before. Why, where is it to be found?" [...] Yes, {{it is true that}} he has commented on that portion of sacred scripture, containing the cosmogony of creation--the fall of man--the first murder--the deluge--and other facts which have puzzled the most learned men of every age; and he has proved to be more learned than all others in his spiritual perceptions. He graduated at a higher university--a university unshackled by human laws, conventional feelings, and preconceived opinions. His intense study of the Bible, guided by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, enabled him to throw a new and beautiful light upon objects which are otherwise obscure. Oh! that young ministers, while attaining valuable book learning, may see the necessity <b>of</b> taking <b>a</b> high degree in, and of never forgetting this Bible university! Reader, is it not surprizing, that such a treatise should have remained comparatively hidden for more than one hundred and fifty years. It has been reprinted in many editions of Bunyan's works: but in all, except the first, with the omission of the scripture references; and with errors <b>of</b> so <b>serious</b> <b>a</b> <b>character</b> as if it was not intended to be read. Even in printing the text of Genesis 7:7 Noah's three sons do not enter the ark! although in 8:16 they are commanded to go forth out of the ark.
