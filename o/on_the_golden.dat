5|$|Having {{finished}} {{fourth in the}} 1999–2000 FA Premier League, Liverpool qualified for the 2000–01 UEFA Cup. Their victory in this competition marked a third win for a club. The entire season was the club's most successful since the 1983–84 season, as they won a cup treble consisting of the UEFA Cup, the FA Cup and the League Cup. Their opponents in the final in Dortmund were Alavés of Spain. The match was tied at 4–4 in extra time when Alavés defender Delfí Geli scored an own goal to give Liverpool victory <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>golden</b> goal rule.|$|E

5|$|In Europe golden jackals are {{not listed}} under the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora nor the 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. Golden jackals in Europe fall under various {{international}} legal instruments. These include the 1979 Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, and the 1992 European Union Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Council Directive provides both guidance and limits on what participating governments can do when {{responding to the}} arrival of expanding jackals. These legislative instruments aim to contribute to conserving native wildlife; some governments argue that the golden jackal is not native wildlife but an invading species. The Golden Jackal informal study Group in Europe (GOJAGE) is an organization that is formed by researchers from across Europe to collect and share information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>golden</b> jackal in Europe. The group also has an interest in the golden jackal's relationship with its environment across Eurasia. Membership is open to anyone that has an interest in golden jackals.|$|E
5|$|Pierce, so far, {{has been}} {{overlooked}} for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

He and the other candidates, including former White Sox teammate Minnie Miñoso, all fell short of selection. The committee meets and votes on ten candidates selected from the 1947 to 1972 era every three years. Pierce received less than 4 votes of the required 12 votes from the committee at the MLB winter meeting on December 8, with no one elected to the Hall by the committee. Ron Santo received 15 votes at the committee's previous election, prior to his 2012 enshrinement.|$|E
5|$|Prime Television {{became a}} network in November 1988, with a shared logo {{produced}} and used across the regional stations, featuring the word Prime Television above an outlined rectangle.

This logo was used across the network until 1991, when a new gold circular logo was introduced. Following a decade in use, 2001 saw the launch of a new simplified yellow logo, with the removal of the circle. This logo was launched concurrently with a similarly design logo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> West Network. Following the 2011 relaunch, a new red logo was introduced which incorporates the Seven Network logo.|$|E

5|$|SR 20 rises {{into the}} Sierra {{along the north}} side of the Yuba River, {{crossing}} to the south side near Smartsville and then climbing through several ravines to the Penn Valley. The current alignment, built in the mid-1980s as a mostly two-lane freeway, continues east across rugged terrain to the city of Grass Valley, where it joins SR 49 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> Center Freeway. The two routes travel northeast to Nevada City, where SR 49 turns northwest and SR 20 resumes its eastward course as a two-lane highway. The roadway climbs from Nevada City and follows Harmony Ridge and Washington Ridge before descending into the Bear Valley via a series of hairpin turns, and then climbing, just north of Emigrant Gap, to its end at I-80 at Yuba Pass. The Pioneer Trail, a National Recreation Trail, parallels SR 20 from a point on Harmony Ridge to the Bear Valley, and includes parts of a branch of the California Trail first used in 1850.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{services}} in Nordhordland started in 1866, and in 1923 {{the first car}} was purchased. A car ferry service between Isdalstø in Lindås and Steinestø in Åsane on the mainland was established on 7 July 1936. A plan was launched whereby all traffic from Nordhordland would be collected {{in one place and}} transported across Salhusfjorden to Åsane. By moving the ferry quay from Isdalstø to Knarvik, the length of the ferry service could be reduced. However, the fares would be kept the same and the extra revenue used to finance a bridge from Flatøy to Lindås. This allowed the Alversund Bridge to open in 1958, and the ferry service from Flatøy and Meland to move to Knarvik. The proposal to cross Salhusfjorden was launched during the planning of the Alversund Bridge. Cost estimates were made based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> Gate Bridge in the United States, but it proved too expensive for a suspension bridge crossing between Frekhaug and Salhus.|$|E
5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 48,050, Liverpool took an early lead when Markus Babbel scored in the fourth minute. They {{extended}} their lead in the 16th minute when Steven Gerrard scored. Midway through the first half, Iván Alonso scored to bring Alavés within a goal of levelling the match. A few minutes {{before the end of}} the first half, Liverpool went 3–1 up when Gary McAllister scored from the penalty spot. Minutes after the start of the second half, Javi Moreno scored twice to level the match at 3–3. Liverpool went in front again in the 76th minute when Robbie Fowler scored. With a minute remaining in the match, Alavés equalised thanks to Jordi Cruyff. The match went into extra time, with the first half goalless. With the match heading for a penalty shoot-out, Delfí Geli headed into his own net; as a result, Liverpool won <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>golden</b> goal rule. The victory meant Liverpool completed a Treble of Football League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup.|$|E
