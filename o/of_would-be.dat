5|$|For {{almost a}} century {{only a few of}} the texts were published. In 1875, the {{director}} of the Chilean National Museum of Natural History in Santiago, Rudolf Philippi, published the Santiago Staff, and Carroll (1892) published part of the Oar. Most texts remained beyond the reach <b>of</b> <b>would-be</b> decipherers until 1958, when Thomas Barthel published line drawings of almost all the known corpus in his Grundlagen zur Entzifferung der Osterinselschrift ("Bases for the Decipherment of the Easter Island script") which remains the fundamental reference to rongorongo. He transcribed texts A through X, over 99% of the corpus; the CEIPP estimates that it is 97% accurate. Barthel's line drawings were not produced free-hand but copied from rubbings, which helped ensure their faithfulness to the originals.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{accession}} Chamberlain considered {{calling a}} general election, but with {{three and a}} half years remaining of the then current Parliament's term he decided to wait. At age 68, he was the second-eldest person in the 20th century (behind Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman) to become Prime Minister for the first time, and was widely seen as a caretaker who would lead the Conservative Party until the next election, and then step down in favour of a younger man, with Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden a likely candidate. From the start of Chamberlain's premiership a number <b>of</b> <b>would-be</b> successors were rumoured to be jockeying for position.|$|E
5|$|Like that {{of almost}} every {{character}} from this period, Jocelin's year of birth is unknown to modern historians. It is known that he entered as a novice monk in Melrose Abbey during the abbacy of Waltheof (ab. 11481159), and from documentary evidence {{it seems likely that}} Jocelin entered Melrose about 50 years before his death in 1199. As the rules of the Cistercian order prevented entry as a novice before the age of 15, it is likely that he was born around the year 1134. Little is known about Jocelin's early life or his early career as a Melrose monk. He obviously successfully completed his one-year noviciate, the year in which a prospective monk was introduced to monasticism and judged fit or unfit for admittance. We know that Abbot Waltheof (Waldef) thought highly of him and granted him many responsibilities. After the death of Abbot Waltheof, his successor, Abbot William, refused to encourage the rumours which had quickly been spreading about Waltheof's saintliness. Abbot William attempted to silence such rumours, and shelter his monks from the intrusiveness <b>of</b> <b>would-be</b> pilgrims. However, William was unable to get the better of Waltheof's emerging cult, and his actions had alienated him from the brethren. As a result, William resigned the abbacy in April 1170. Jocelin was by this stage the Prior of Melrose, that is, the second in command at the monastery, and thus William's most likely replacement.|$|E

25|$|Historians, James Huston notes, {{have been}} baffled by {{the role of}} high tariffs in general and have offered {{multiple}} conflicting interpretations over the years. (Low tariffs, all historians agree, were noncontroversial and were needed to fund the federal government.) One school of thought says the Republicans were the willing tools <b>of</b> <b>would-be</b> monopolists. A second schools says the Republicans truly believed tariffs would promote nationalism and prosperity for everyone along with balanced growth in every region (as opposed to growth only in the cotton South). A third school emphasizes the undeniable importance of the tariff in cementing party loyalty, especially in industrial states. Another approach emphasizes that factory workers were eager for high tariffs because it protected their high wages from European competition.|$|E
25|$|With {{no support}} or {{leadership}} from Thiệu, the evacuation {{turned into a}} costly debacle, as the communists pounded the city with artillery, killing {{tens of thousands of}} people. Many drowned while jostling for room on the boats; with no logistical support from Saigon, those vessels sent were far too few for the millions <b>of</b> <b>would-be</b> evacuees. Only around 16,000 soldiers were pulled out, and of the almost two million civilians that packed Đà Nẵng, a little more than 50,000 were evacuated. As a result, 70,000 troops were taken prisoner, along with around 100 fighter jets. Trưởng and his officers swam to a boat in the sea and evacuated to Saigon. In quick succession the remaining cities along the coastline collapsed and half the country had fallen in two weeks.|$|E
25|$|With the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, along the intracity frontier, Potsdamer Platz now found itself physically divided in two. What had once been a busy intersection had become totally desolate. With the clearance of most of the remaining bomb-damaged buildings on both sides (on the eastern side, this was done chiefly to give border guards a clear view <b>of</b> <b>would-be</b> escapees and an uninterrupted line of fire), little was left in an area of dozens of hectares. Further demolitions occurred up until 1976 when the Haus Vaterland finally disappeared. After that, only two buildings in the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz still stood– one complete, the other in a half-ruined fragmented form: the Weinhaus Huth's steel skeleton had enabled the building to withstand the pounding of World War II virtually undamaged, and it stood out starkly amid a great levelled wasteland, although now occupied only by groups of squatters. A short distance away stood portions of the former Hotel Esplanade, including the Kaisersaal, used at various times as a much scaled-down hotel, cinema, nightclub and occasional film-set (scenes from Cabaret were shot there). Apart from these, no other buildings remained. Below ground, the U-Bahn section through Potsdamer Platz had closed entirely; although the S-Bahn line itself remained open, it suffered from a quirk of geography in that it briefly passed through East German territory en route from one part of West Berlin to another. Consequently, Potsdamer Platz S-Bahn station became the most infamous of several Geisterbahnhofe (ghost stations), through which trains ran without stopping, its previously bustling platforms now decrepit, sealed off from the outside world, and patrolled by armed guards.|$|E

His best work includes [...] "The Thrust in Tierce," [...] a short story written for the Overland Monthly, and a yearly Christmas piece, [...] "quaint, grotesque or poetical" [...] usually describing the serio-comic antics <b>of</b> <b>would-be</b> San Francisco aristocrats with little claim to fame.|$|E
500|$|Molina {{appeared}} in 51 regular-season games and batted [...]267 with {{two home runs}} and 15 RBI in 151 plate appearances.

500|$|The {{somewhat}} tenuous {{hold the}} Vijayanagara centre had on its southern periphery resulted only partly from the latter's remoteness. The centralisation {{imposed by the}} empire was resisted by the southern chiefs (sometimes called rajas, or [...] "little kings") for moral and political reasons as well; according to historian Burton Stein: [...] 'Little kings', or rajas, never attained the legal independence of an aristocracy from both monarchs and the local people whom they ruled. The sovereign claims <b>of</b> <b>would-be</b> centralizing, South Indian rulers and the resources demanded {{in the name of}} that sovereignty diminished the resources which local chieftains used as a kind of royal largess; thus centralizing demands were opposed on moral as well as on political grounds by even quite modest chiefs.|$|E

The dowry, a huge sum for the time, prompted a large number <b>of</b> <b>would-be</b> husbands. A Scottish captain arrived, having spent {{the greater part of}} a month's pay on a new suit, and was taken by Tannakin's figure and deportment. On lifting the veil to view her face, however, [...] "hee would stay no other conference, but ran away without further answer, saying; they must pardon him, for hee could indure no Porke." [...] An English sow-man (pig farmer) assured the family that his familiarity with pigs meant he would accept Tannakin's appearance, but after meeting her he left the building, saying that [...] "so long as I have known Rumford, I never saw such a Hogsnout".|$|E
500|$|Baseball Prospectus {{estimated}} in 2013 that Molina saved 35 defensive runs per season through his pitch framing and had moved 301 out-of-zone pitches that were called strikes between April 1 and June 30, 2013. [...] As of July 2013, Molina had also thrown out 45% <b>of</b> <b>would-be</b> base stealers. [...] At one time, an Arizona Diamondbacks official stated a team policy existed {{not to run}} on Molina. [...] With pickoffs, Molina throws from behind left-handed batters to obfuscate the runner's view of his motion to first base. [...] Besides studying hitters at the plate, Molina also studies base runners to watch their decision-making process about stealing bases or when they are less guarded against a pickoff. [...] He practices pickoff moves and coordinates signals with the first basemen to indicate when he is primed to move for a pickoff throw. [...] In 2012, a Sports Illustrated poll of 306 players found that Molina was the [...] "toughest catcher to run on." ...|$|E
500|$|With little {{practical}} {{support from}} CEMA, Imogen's organisational talents, {{according to her}} friend Ursula Vaughan Williams, [...] "developed brilliantly". According to Imogen's account, her duties included conducting local brass bands, leading hymn-singing practice ("fourteen very old women in hats sitting round {{the edge of a}} dark, empty hideous tin hut"), and organising sing-songs for evacuee children. She arranged [...] performances by professional groups, and what she termed [...] "drop-in-and-sing" [...] festivals in which anyone could join. [...] Imogen also writes of [...] "idyllic days" [...] spent over cups of tea, discussing the hopes and dreams <b>of</b> <b>would-be</b> music makers. Her compositional activity in these years was limited by time and pressures of work, but she produced two recorder trios—the Offley and Deddington suites—and made numerous arrangements for female voices of carols and traditional songs. By the summer of 1942 the workload and concomitant bureaucracy was such that she was exhausted, and in need of a lengthy rest.|$|E

500|$|Michelle Erica Green, who {{reviewed}} the episode for TrekNation in May 2007, {{thought she might}} be more forgiving in hindsight as she knows that the follow-ups to [...] "Datalore" [...] were great episodes. She thought it was reminiscent of the evil twin of Captain James T. Kirk in [...] episode [...] "" [...] and the mirror universe version of Spock seen in [...] "". She felt that Lore lacked any motivation for what he was intending to do, and that the crew were made to look [...] "pretty stupid" [...] by their inaction to the Lore threat. She thought that the ending was shocking, as transporting the villain into space would never have occurred if they were human, and [...] "a moment of utter inconsistency" [...] as Lore had only just told the entity to attack when the shields drop following a transporter activation. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] valued the episode for providing backstory to Data, but said that [...] "no one is smart enough to realize the obvious. None of the crew except Boy Wesley realizes that Lore is impersonating Data — and when Wesley (who is always somehow more observant than the silly adults) brings this to their attention, we get helpful lines like, [...] "Shut up, Wesley," [...] which lead to even more helpful lines <b>of</b> <b>would-be</b> teenage rebellion when Wesley complains about the officers not listening to him. Quite simply, this is annoying material, continuing in season one's trend of Wesley's child status as a plot device. Meanwhile, all the adults look terminally clueless."

500|$|Along with counter-propaganda, the Viet Minh {{also sought}} to detain or {{otherwise}} prevent would-be refugees from leaving. As the American and French military personnel were only present in the major cities and at air bases and on the waterfront, the communists tried to stop people from trying to leave through a {{military presence in the}} ruralside to interdict the flow <b>of</b> <b>would-be</b> refugees. The communists were most effective in Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa Provinces, which they had long controlled; only 20% of Catholics in Thanh Hóa migrated. In parts of the Red River Delta, ferry services and other water traffic were shut down so that refugees {{would not be able to}} travel to Haiphong. In some cases there were reports of thousands-strong groups of refugees being forced back by similar numbers of armed communist cadres. The most notorious took place at Tra Ly and Ba Lang. At Tra Ly, Viet Minh troops forcibly dispersed most of a group of about 10,000 refugees. Some villagers who fled to sandbars offshore hoping for sanctuary were trapped by rising tides. The French asked the International Control Commission to dispatch mobile teams to Tra Ly, but the Viet Minh hindered ICC movement and had finished their job before the team arrived. French naval officers on the scene reported that the Viet Minh fired upon villagers in the dunes. At Ba Lang in December, the Viet Minh arrested refugee leaders who had contacted a French ship. This prompted villagers to clash with soldiers, killing one and capturing three, before barricading themselves inside a church. Troops forced their way into the church and dispersed the Vietnamese peasants, arresting several hundred. The village leader and a priest were tried by a kangaroo [...] "People’s Court" [...] and sentenced to prison. As a result, many refugees headed directly for the nearest coastal point to wait for passing vessels. In one sweep of the coast near the Catholic stronghold of Phát Diêm, the French Navy picked up 42,000 stranded refugees in two days. The VNA also swept the area in late 1954 for two days, picking up several thousand refugees, but increasing communist attacks forced them to stop. In some rural coastal areas where it was common for refugees to converge before boarding vessels to connect to the long-distance naval vessels taking them south, the Viet Minh installed mortars on the beaches to deter prospective immigrants.|$|E
