In his {{appearance}} he wore a striped pullover and a battered, beflowered silk <b>opera</b> <b>hat.</b> The outfit signified life's fragility and Bip became his alter ego, just as the [...] "Little Tramp" [...] became Charlie Chaplin's. Bip's misadventures with everything from butterflies to lions, from ships and trains, to dance-halls or restaurants, were limitless. As a style of Pantomime, Marceau was acknowledged without peer. Marceau, during a televised talk with Todd Farley, expresses his respect for the mime techniques that Charlie Chaplin used in his films, noting that Chaplin {{seemed to be the}} only silent film actor who used mime.|$|E
6000|$|GEORGE DEDMOND enters {{from the}} hall. He is in evening dress, [...] <b>opera</b> <b>hat,</b> and overcoat; {{his face is}} broad, comely, glossily [...] shaved, but with neat moustaches. His eyes, clear, small, and [...] blue-grey, have little speculation. His hair is well brushed.|$|E

50|$|Grosgrain is {{also used}} in millinery. Grosgrain ribbons are popular {{creating}} ribbon decorations for hats (made into flowers, for example), however grosgrain is most notably used in top <b>hats</b> and <b>opera</b> <b>hats,</b> or as the trimming band on the Homburg.|$|R
5000|$|F. Scott Fitzgerald {{references}} {{the musical}} in his 1928 short story The Captured Shadow, describing a sheet music cover from the play with [...] "three men in evening clothes and <b>opera</b> <b>hats</b> sauntering jovially along Broadway."

60|$|But when he {{came down}} Parliament Street to Westminster Abbey he felt a {{different}} atmosphere, and he was roused to Jeremiac indignation at the sight, in a passing cab, of a gilded youth in an <b>opera</b> <b>hat,</b> with his coat buttoned up to hide his dress clothes.|$|E
60|$|At Ninth street a {{tall man}} wearing an <b>opera</b> <b>hat</b> alighted from a Broadway car and turned his face westward. But he saw Murray, pounced upon him and dragged him under a street light. The Captain lumbered slowly to the corner, like a wounded bear, and waited, growling.|$|E
60|$|The door of {{the dining-room}} was open, the gas turned low; a spirit-urn hissed on a tea-tray, and close to it a cynical looking cat had fallen asleep on the dining-table. Old Jolyon 'shoo'd' her off at once. The {{incident}} {{was a relief to}} his feelings; he rattled his <b>opera</b> <b>hat</b> behind the animal.|$|E
60|$|The party {{stayed to}} the end of the interminable opera. They had agreed to wait for Aaron. He was to come around to the {{vestibule}} for them, after the show. They trooped slowly down-stairs into the crush of the entrance hall. Chattering, swirling people, red carpet, palms green against cream-and-gilt walls, small whirlpools of life at the open, dark doorways, men in <b>opera</b> <b>hats</b> steering decisively about-it was the old scene. But there were no taxis--absolutely no taxis. And it was raining. Fortunately the women had brought shoes. They slipped these on. Jim rocked through the crowd, in his tall hat, looking for the flautist.|$|R
50|$|Chiriri is {{the yellow}} Bottle Fairy; she has blonde hair and yellow eyes. She is {{associated}} with summer. She is friendly and slightly reserved, with a surreal imagination. She is obsessed with soap <b>opera</b> and <b>hats.</b> She can also turn wishes into reality.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{sources have}} taken this to {{describe}} an early folding top hat, {{although it is not}} explicitly stated whether Dollman's design was specifically for male or female headgear. Dollman's patent expired in 1825. In France, around 1840, Antoine Gibus's design for a spring-loaded collapsible top-hat proved so popular that hats made to it became known as gibus. [...] They were also often called <b>opera</b> <b>hats</b> due to the common practice of storing them in their flattened state under one's seat at the opera, though the term can also refer to any tall formal men's hat. The characteristic snapping sound heard upon opening a gibus suggested a third name, the chapeau claque, [...] "claque" [...] being the French word for [...] "slap".|$|R
60|$|Putting on his ancient <b>opera</b> <b>hat,</b> which, {{with its}} brim {{flattened}} by use, and huge capacity, {{looked like an}} emblem of greater days, and, pulling out an old pair of very thin lavender kid gloves smelling strongly of Russia leather, from habitual proximity to the cigar-case {{in the pocket of}} his overcoat, he stepped into a hansom.|$|E

60|$|Not so was Fledgeby seen on this occasion. Arrayed in superb raiment, {{with his}} <b>opera</b> <b>hat</b> under his arm, he {{concluded}} his self-examination hopefully, awaited {{the arrival of}} Miss Podsnap, and talked small-talk with Mrs Lammle. In facetious homage to the smallness of his talk, and the jerky nature of his manners, Fledgeby's familiars had agreed to confer upon him (behind his back) the honorary title of Fascination Fledgeby.|$|E
60|$|Cawdor {{left his}} two companions and sank {{on to the}} couch by Rounceby's side. The young man, with his <b>opera</b> <b>hat</b> still on his head, and the light {{overcoat}} {{which he had been}} carrying on the floor by his side, was seated before the writing table with his back to them. Miss Brown was leaning over him, with her hand upon the back of his chair. They were out of hearing of the other three men.|$|E
60|$|This was not {{the sort}} of love that {{finished}} Amelia's education; {{and in the course of}} a year turned a good young girl into a good young woman--to be a good wife presently, when the happy time should come. This young person (perhaps it was very imprudent in her parents to encourage her, and abet her in such idolatry and silly romantic ideas) loved, with all her heart, the young officer in His Majesty's service with whom we have made a brief acquaintance. She thought about him the very first moment on waking; and his was the very last name mentioned in her prayers. She never had seen a man so beautiful or so clever: such a figure on horseback: such a dancer: such a hero in general. Talk of the Prince's bow! what was it to George's? She had seen Mr. Brummell, whom everybody praised so. Compare such a person as that to her George! Not amongst all the beaux at the Opera (and there were beaux in those days with actual <b>opera</b> <b>hats)</b> was there any one to equal him. He was only good enough to be a fairy prince; and oh, what magnanimity to stoop to such a humble Cinderella! Miss Pinkerton would have tried to check this blind devotion very likely, had she been Amelia's confidante; but not with much success, depend upon it. It is in the nature and instinct of some women. Some are made to scheme, and some to love; and I wish any respected bachelor that reads this may take the sort that best likes him.|$|R
5000|$|Under French {{rule the}} Opera House had {{primarily}} {{been for the}} colonial population. With {{the departure of the}} French population the Opera House turned more to local genres including classical Sino-Vietnamese <b>hát</b> tuồng <b>opera,</b> classical Vietnamese <b>hát</b> chèo drama, and the popular cải lương folk musical, as well as Socialist theatre and musical. The Opera House also holds concerts of Vietnamese music, both classical ca trù, and neotraditional Vietnamese-Western (nhạc dân tộc cải biên, [...] "revised national music"), folk genres such as hát chầu văn ("hát văn") and quan họ, and popular songs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{waistcoat}} {{should not}} be visible below {{the front of the}} tailcoat, which necessitates a high waistline and (often) braces for the trousers. As one style writer for GQ magazine summarises [...] "The simple rule of thumb is that you should only ever see black and white not black, white and black again". While Debrett's accepts double cuffs for shirts worn with white tie, some tailors and merchant suggest that single, linked cuffs are the most traditional and formal variation acceptable under the dress code. Decorations may also be worn and, unlike Debrett's, Cambridge University's Varsity student newspaper suggests a top <b>hat,</b> <b>opera</b> cloak and silver-topped cane are acceptable accessories. Some invitations to white-tie events, like the last published edition of the British Lord Chamberlain's Guide to Dress at Court, state that national costume or national dress may be substituted for white tie.|$|R
60|$|However, {{being in}} so far I decided to go clean through. I bought a white tie, some high collars, two pairs of gloves and a folding <b>opera</b> <b>hat.</b> I could not bring myself {{to the point of}} wearing a high hat in the day time (that was almost too much of a change from my broad brim), {{although}} my Prince Albert Frock, which I wore morning, noon, and night, was in conformity with English custom. Even the clerks were so attired.|$|E
60|$|As usual {{there was}} a block outside, and the few yards {{between us and the}} door seemed interminable. I had none of the {{optimism}} of those others. I was filled with vague fears of some impending disaster. Suddenly, with a shiver, I recognized Cullen, scarcely a couple of yards away, also watching, wedged in among the throng. His lips were drawn closely together; his <b>opera</b> <b>hat</b> was well over his forehead; his eyes never left Mr. Parker. He looked to me there like a lean-faced rat preparing for its spring.|$|E
6000|$|... "If Lady Albury {{can manage}} {{it with her}} aunt of course I will wait upon her," [...] said the Colonel. Then {{the door of the}} {{carriage}} was shut, and the Colonel was left to look for a cab. He had on an overcoat and an <b>opera</b> <b>hat,</b> but otherwise was dressed as for dinner. On one side a link-boy was offering him assistance, and on another a policeman tendering him some service. He {{was one of those who}} by their outward appearance always extort respect from those around them.|$|E
5000|$|Borm in Saginaw, Michigan, Trogan was {{a musical}} prodigy. He {{performed}} classical piano {{music as a}} teenager on WKNX Radio in Saginaw from 1947 to 1950, before beginning formal training in composition at the University of Michigan. There he studied with Ross Lee Finney, Luigi Dallapiccola and Leslie Bassett and received his B.Mus. in 1954, M.Mus. in 1955, and D.M.A. in 1963. His compositional work during this time was recognized by awards from BMI and the Louisville Symphony, which performed Trogan's Two Scenes for Orchestra in 1955. [...] A Fulbright Scholarship for study in Rome was rescinded by the House Committee on Un-American Activities because Trogan had signed a petition supporting the prominent socialist, Norman Thomas. In addition to graduate fellowships in music theory and English, Trogan was engaged as Associate Conductor and Composer-in-Residence by the Saginaw Civic Symphony, under the Russian conductor Josef Cherniavsky. Trogan came to Cherniavsky's attention after learning of Trogan's prize winning one-act <b>opera,</b> The <b>Hat</b> Man (1954), which was widely performed. While a graduate student Trogan produced chamber works for vocal and instrumental ensembles: the Sextet for Wind Quintet and Piano, Elegy for String Quartet and Contralto, and incidental music for Berthold Brecht's The Good Woman of Szechuan. Additional works from that time include Duos on Tone Rows, Five Pieces for Piano, and his Soliloquy for Piano, {{which was published in}} 1955 in Generation magazine as an homage to Arnold Schoenberg.|$|R
6000|$|Yes {{because he}} never did {{a thing like that}} before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his {{highness}} to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes {{and the end of the}} world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the <b>opera</b> <b>hats</b> I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a|$|R
60|$|I removed four bricks to make footholes in {{different}} positions up the wall. It was desperately hard and long work, {{easy as it}} may sound in description--especially when I had to hold on by the top of the wall, with my flat <b>opera</b> <b>hat</b> (as we used to call it in those days) laid, as a guard, between my hand and the glass, while I cleared a way through the sharp bottle-ends for my other hand and my knees. This done, my great difficulty was vanquished; and I had only to drop luxuriously into a flower-bed {{on the other side of}} the wall.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sydney Barnes came {{slowly into}} view. He {{was wearing an}} evening suit, {{obviously}} too large for him, a made-up white tie had slipped round underneath his ear, a considerable fragment of red silk handkerchief was visible between his waistcoat and much crumpled white shirt. An <b>opera</b> <b>hat,</b> also too large for him, he was wearing {{very much on the}} back of his head, and he was smoking a very black cigar, from which he had failed to remove the band. He frowned when he saw Wrayson, but followed the Baroness into the room with a pronounced swagger.|$|E
6000|$|Folding his <b>opera</b> <b>hat,</b> he sat down, {{drew out}} his {{lavender}} gloves {{in the old}} way, and took up his glasses for a long look round the house. Dropping them at last on his folded hat, he fixed {{his eyes on the}} curtain. More poignantly than ever he felt that it was all over and done with him. Where were all the women, the pretty women, the house used to be so full of? Where was that old feeling in the heart as he waited for one of those great singers? Where that sensation of the intoxication of life and of his own power to enjoy it all? ...|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly {{he stopped}} abruptly. Huddled {{up in the}} corner of a seat was a man with a cloth cap pulled forward {{screening}} his face: at that moment Lord Wolfenden was in a mood to be extravagantly generous to any poor applicant for alms, lavishly sympathetic to any tale of distress. But it was not ordinary curiosity that arrested his progress now. He knew almost at the first glance who it was that sat in this dejected attitude, although the <b>opera</b> <b>hat</b> was replaced by the soft cloth cap, and in other details the man's appearance was altered. It was indeed the Mr. Felix who had supped with him at the [...] "Milan" [...] and subsequently behaved in so astonishing a fashion.|$|E
6000|$|But {{they did}} not go to the opera after all, for in getting up from dinner the {{dizziness}} came over him again, and she insisted on his staying quiet and going to bed early. When he parted from her {{at the door of the}} hotel, having paid the cabman to drive her to Chelsea, he sat down again for a moment to enjoy the memory of her words: [...] "You are such a darling to me, Uncle Jolyon!" [...] Why! Who wouldn't be! He would have liked to stay up another day and take her to the Zoo, but two days running of him would bore her to death. No, he must wait till next Sunday; she had promised to come then. They would settle those lessons for Holly, if only for a month. It would be something. That little Mam'zelle Beauce wouldn't like it, but she would have to lump it. And crushing his old <b>opera</b> <b>hat</b> against his chest he sought the lift.|$|E
60|$|It {{is eight}} {{o'clock in the}} evening. The {{curtains}} are drawn and the lamps lighted {{in the drawing room}} of Her flat in Cromwell Road. Her lover, a beautiful youth of eighteen, in evening dress and cape, with a bunch of flowers and an <b>opera</b> <b>hat</b> in his hands, comes in alone. The door is near the corner; and as he appears in the doorway, he has the fireplace on the nearest wall to his right, and the grand piano along the opposite wall to his left. Near the fireplace a small ornamental table has on it a hand mirror, a fan, a pair of long white gloves, and a little white woollen cloud to wrap a woman's head in. On {{the other side of the}} room, near the piano, is a broad, square, softly up-holstered stool. The room is furnished in the most approved South Kensington fashion: that is, it is as like a show room as possible, and is intended to demonstrate the racial position and spending powers of its owners, and not in the least to make them comfortable.|$|E
6000|$|Paul Verlaine alternated {{between the}} two halves of his nature with so little {{apparent}} resistance that he seemed like a bad child, though to read his sacred poems is to remember perhaps that the Holy Infant shared His first home with the beasts. In what month was it that I received a note inviting me to [...] "coffee and cigarettes plentifully," [...] and signed [...] "Yours quite cheerfully, Paul Verlaine?" [...] I found him {{at the top of a}} tenement house in the Rue St. Jacques, sitting in an easy chair, his bad leg swaddled in many bandages. He asked me, speaking in English, if I knew Paris well, and added, pointing to his leg, that it had scorched his leg for he know it [...] "well, too well" [...] and [...] "lived in it like a fly in a pot of marmalade." [...] He took up an English dictionary, one of the few books in the room, and began searching for the name of his disease, selecting after a long search and with, as I understood, only comparative accuracy [...] "Erysipelas." [...] Meanwhile his homely, middle-aged mistress made the coffee and found the cigarettes; it was obviously she who had given the room its character; her canaries in several cages hanging in the window, and her sentimental lithographs nailed here and there among the nude drawings and newspaper caricatures of her lover as various kinds of monkey, which he had pinned upon the wall. A slovenly, ragged man came in, his trousers belted with a piece of rope and an <b>opera</b> <b>hat</b> upon his head. She drew a box over to the fire, and he sat down, now holding the <b>opera</b> <b>hat</b> upon his knees, and I think he must have acquired it very lately for he kept constantly closing and opening it. Verlaine introduced him by saying, [...] "He is a poor man, but a good fellow, and is so like Louis XI to look at that we call him Louis the XIth." [...] I remember that Verlaine talked of Victor Hugo who was [...] "a supreme poet, but a volcano of mud as well as of flame," [...] and of Villiers de L'Isle Adam who was [...] "exalté" [...] and wrote excellent French; and of In Memoriam, which he had tried to translate and could not. [...] "Tennyson is too noble, too Anglais; when he should have been brokenhearted, he had many reminiscences." ...|$|E
