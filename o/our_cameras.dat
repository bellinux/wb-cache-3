500|$|Co-director Johnson {{would go}} over each {{scene with the}} animators, {{sometimes}} acting out the scene, if necessary. The animators would create a [...] "dope sheet"—in which a shot was broken down, frame by frame—to account for key [...] "hits". The animators would then shoot tests of the scene, often shooting on [...] "2s" [...] or [...] "4s" [...] (meaning shooting just every second or fourth frame of what would appear in the final animation). Johnson explained: [...] "The next day, when they'd finish their test/rehearsal, we'd cut it in {{and see how it}} played in the reel and fine-tune from there. We might do some lighting tweaks, performance tweaks or have the art department get in and touch anything that needed it. Then we'd close the curtain and let the animator animate the shot." [...] The animators would sometimes make use of the voice and/or video recordings of the actors, a practice also common in cel animation. Once photographed, the frames were manipulated by a team of [...] "data wranglers." [...] Using a workflow developed by Chris Watts, the frames were downloaded from the camera image cards as RAW files, converted to Cineon files and processed through a [...] "color cube." [...] Cinematographer Pete Kozachik explained: [...] "The color cube is a 3D lookup table created by FilmLight Ltd. that forces the image data into behaving like a particular Eastman Kodak film stock—in this case, 5248, one of my favorites. With this film emulation, we could actually rate <b>our</b> <b>cameras</b> at ASA 100, then take our light meters and spot meters and, with great confidence, shoot as if we were using 5248. Sure enough, the footage would come back and look just like it." [...] The frames could be processed further to generate a TIFF file for viewing on the lighting station computer monitors so lighting, composition and color could be previewed.|$|E

To demonstrate this, each image is marked with its quantitative SNR {{on the top}} left. Right: The RGBCY mode of <b>our</b> <b>camera</b> provides better color fidelity than a RGB or CMY camera for colorful scene (top). The ∆E deviation in CIELAB space {{of each of these}} images from a ground truth (captured using SOC- 730 hyperspectral camera) is encoded as grayscale images with error statistics (mean, maximum and standard deviation) provided at the bottom of each image. Note the close match between the image captured with <b>our</b> <b>camera</b> and the ground truth. We present a camera with switchable primaries using shiftable layers of color filter arrays (CFAs). By layering a pair of CMY CFAs in this novel manner we can switch between multiple sets of color primaries (namely RGB, CMY and RGBCY) in the same camera. In contrast to fixed color primaries (e. g. RGB or CMY), which cannot provide optimal image quality for all scene conditions, <b>our</b> <b>camera</b> with switchable primaries provides optimal color fidelity and signal to noise ratio for multiple scene conditions. Next, we show that the same concept can be used to layer two RGB CFAs to design a camera with switchable low dynamic range (LDR) and high dynamic range (HDR) modes.

40|$|Introduction In {{the real}} world, the scene may contain some well-illuminated {{areas as well}} as some areas that are in the darkness. The dynamic range of the scene, or the {{radiance}} ratio between the brightest and the darkest spots, can be quite big [...] it can span several orders of magnitude in some cases. This is a lot wider range than the range that <b>our</b> digital <b>camera</b> can adequately capture, and that our monitor can adequately display. The areas that are too bright for the dynamic range of <b>our</b> <b>camera</b> are going to be saturated on our image, and the areas that are too dark will be under-exposed. In both cases, all the information about these areas will be lost in the image. A way to solve this problem is to combine different shutter speeds of <b>our</b> <b>camera.</b> Smaller shutter speeds can give us good information about the bright areas (because we won't have saturation), and longer shutter speeds effectively capture the dark areas. So by alternating the shutter speeds and by combining the two ima...|$|R
