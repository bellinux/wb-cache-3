Hence, a self-written waveguide (SWW) optical pin is implemented between surface device and multi-layer channel as <b>optical</b> <b>coupling</b> for reaching high coupling efficiency. A comparatively studies of three configurations of coupling methods {{was carried out by}} ray-tracing simulation. The correlation between <b>optical</b> <b>coupling</b> efficiency and mirror angle was analyzed as well as the relationship between <b>optical</b> <b>coupling</b> efficiency and photodiode (PD) positional. A maximum value of <b>optical</b> <b>coupling</b> efficiency with <b>optical</b> pin is obtained for both correlations. The 1 dB down-tolerance width of the correlation between <b>optical</b> <b>coupling</b> efficiency and the mirror angle for vertical pin (case 1) is larger compared to case 2 and case 3 (without vertical pin). For the relationship between <b>optical</b> <b>coupling</b> efficiency and PD positional error, the 1 dB down-tolerance widths for case 1, case 2 and case 3 were ± 13 μm, ± 19 μm and ± 20 μm, respectively. From this result, it is found that vertical pin is well-suited to satisfy both coupling efficiency and tolerance for shifting mirror angle and PD positional error...|$|R

The integrated device {{is treated as}} a three-port optoelectronic device with two electrical ports and one optical output port. The scattering parameters of this three-port device have been measured in the designed experiment. The measured results indicate that there exists the electrical coupling between the DFB laser and EA modulator of the integrated light source whenever the current applied to the laser section is below or above the threshold current, and the <b>optical</b> <b>coupling</b> will have stronger influence on the frequency responses than the electrical coupling when the bias current is above the threshold. A small-signal equivalent circuit model for the integrated device is established considering both the electrical and internal <b>optical</b> <b>coupling.</b> Experiments show that the equivalent circuit model is reasonable and the determined element values are correct.

However, the popularity of this measurement tool is limited by its substantial size and portability. Therefore, the MZI was integrated with a small fiber-optic waveguide component to develop an interferometer with fiber-optic characteristics, specifically a fiber-optic Mach-Zehnder interferometer (FO-MZI). Optical fiber must be processed to fabricate two <b>optical</b> <b>coupling</b> structures. The two <b>optical</b> <b>coupling</b> structures are a duplicate of the beam splitter, an optical component of the interferometer. Therefore, when the sensor length and the two <b>optical</b> <b>coupling</b> structures vary, the time or path for optical transmission in the sensor changes, thereby influencing the back-end interference signals.

The spacing value between the troughs of the sensor length and interference signal exhibited an inverse relationship. In addition, image analysis was employed to examine the size-matching relationship between various sensor lengths and the coupling and decoupling structure.
