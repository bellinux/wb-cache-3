5|$|After {{the launch}} of the {{persecution}} campaign in 1999, practitioners outside China began holding frequent protests, rallies, and appeals. These include large-scale marches, demonstrations, and vigils to coincide with notable anniversaries, such as April 25, 1999, and July 20, 1999. Marches typically involve participants holding signs and banners, devoting different sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parade</b> to different aspects of the persecution. There is usually a section involving participants wearing only white (symbolizing mourning) and holding photos of those killed in China.|$|E

5|$|After the {{previous}} depot was destroyed, the Central Vermont Railroad (which then leased the New London Northern) began making {{plans for a}} larger replacement station. The Central Vermont and the New Haven Railroad (which had bought the Shore Line in 1870) bought the east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parade</b> from New London for the unusually low price of $15,000, {{with the understanding that}} the railroads would build a structure more suitable for the bustling city.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} {{complaints}} {{were made to}} RCMP about the comments by one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parade</b> organizers, Inderjit Singh Bains, on Sher-E-Punjab radio.

5|$|Churchill {{has been}} a leader of Colorado AIM's annual protests in Denver against the Columbus Day holiday and its {{associated}} parade. Colorado AIM's leadership has come into conflict with some leaders in the Denver Italian American community, the main supporters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parade.</b> As early as 2004, Churchill had claimed that such parades are unconstitutional, arguing that the Ninth Amendment to the Constitution provides Native Americans with a right not to be subjected to such displays, overriding the First Amendment rights of non-Native Americans.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Drumcree Sunday" [...] <b>parade</b> from <b>the</b> town centre, to Drumcree Church, {{and back}} again.

The 2008 budget crisis led {{the city to}} propose closing numerous libraries and firehouses and <b>the</b> scaling back <b>of</b> expenditures for <b>the</b> <b>parade,</b> offering $300,000 for <b>the</b> 2009 <b>parade</b> and nothing for 2010.|$|R

5|$|On April 16, 2010, the {{day prior}} to the annual Vaisakhi Parade held in Surrey, B.C., one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parade</b> {{organizers}} issued a statement indicating should Dosanjh and BC Liberal backbencher Dave Hayer choose to attend the parade, their safety could not be guaranteed. This was {{due in part to}} comments that Dosanjh had made after the parade in 2007, suggesting a police investigation into reports of a parade float that had a picture of Talwinder Singh Parmar on it, the alleged mastermind behind the bombing of Air India Flight 182. Dosanjh also expressed concerns over some attendees wearing International Sikh Youth Federation T-shirts, a terrorist organization that is banned in India, Britain, the United States, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{rest of the}} {{interior}} of the fortress was, at various times, occupied by a range of different military buildings, but they have mostly been demolished and grassed over to form a large parade ground. Among the surviving buildings are the Royal Garrison Artillery barracks, located to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parade</b> ground. Built between 1900 and 1902, it could hold 140 soldiers in 12 man barrack-rooms. Alongside the barracks are bungalows, originally for the use of senior non-commissioned officers, a storehouse dating from the Napoleonic Wars, and two guard barracks from 1700, which form a very early example of this form of military architecture in England. Other buildings that have survived include a 19th-century field train shed, and an 18th-century gunpowder magazine, since converted into a shelter for gunners.|$|E

50|$|From 1987 to 1999, Dunlop was Senator of Queen’s University Belfast.

5|$|A {{ceremony}} of dedication {{was held on}} the afternoon of October 28, 1886. President Grover Cleveland, the former New York governor, presided over the event. On the morning of the dedication, a parade was held in New York City; {{estimates of the number of}} people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million. President Cleveland headed the procession, then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America. General Stone was the grand marshal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parade.</b> The route began at Madison Square, once the venue for the arm, and proceeded to the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan by way of Fifth Avenue and Broadway, with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the World building on Park Row. As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange, traders threw ticker tape from the windows, beginning the New York tradition of the ticker-tape parade.|$|E
5|$|Méliès, who {{had begun}} A Trip to the Moon in May 1902, {{finished}} {{the film in}} August of that year and began selling prints to French distributors in the same month. From September through December 1902, a hand-colored print of A Trip to the Moon was screened at Méliès's Théâtre Robert-Houdin in Paris. The film was shown after Saturday and Thursday matinee performances by Méliès's colleague and fellow magician, Jules-Eugène Legris, who appeared as the leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parade</b> in the two final scenes. Méliès sold black-and-white and color prints of the film through his Star Film Company, where the film was assigned the catalogue number 399–411 and given the descriptive subtitle Pièce à grand spectacle en 30 tableaux. In France, black-and-white prints sold for 560, and hand-colored prints for 1,000. Méliès also sold the film indirectly through Charles Urban's Warwick Trading Company in London.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parade</b> are two early 18th century magazines, altered in the 19th century. These were {{specially}} designed to avoid the use of iron, which might have generated sparks and set off an explosion, instead being built using wood and copper; {{they are the only}} remaining examples of their type in Britain. The Landport Gate lies behind the magazines, and has a gatehouse, called the Dead House, above the passageway leading into the interior of the fort. Past the north-west bastion, the soldiers' barracks would have stood opposite those of the officers', but was destroyed after the war and only the foundations of the building remain. The south-west magazine also holds a covered magazine, similar to that in the north-east bastion. Just {{to the west of the}} Water Gate is the fort's guardhouse and chapel, dating from the late 17th century and one of the oldest surviving places of worship within a British artillery fortress.|$|E
50|$|For the Twelfth, in July 2004, Boreland led a {{group of}} UDA members past the Ardoyne shops as {{followers}} of a contentious Orange Order <b>parade</b> at <b>the</b> interface area, despite <b>the</b> <b>Parades</b> Commission stating that the march could only pass the shops without followers. His involvement in <b>the</b> <b>parade</b> led to <b>the</b> Social Democratic and Labour Party's Martin Morgan threatening to resign from the Northern Ireland Policing Board after accusing <b>the</b> PSNI <b>of</b> ignoring <b>the</b> rulings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parades</b> Commission due to Boreland and the other paramilitaries being allowed to march.|$|R

5|$|The RLI trooped the Colour for {{the only}} time on 27 July 1970. Among the 3,000 spectators at Cranborne Barracks were the Mayor and Mayoress of Salisbury, the commanders of 2 and 3 Brigades and the {{commanding}} officer of the Rhodesian African Rifles. Regimental Sergeant Major Robin Tarr began the proceedings at 10:35, at which time the RAR band and drums started to play the RLI's slow march, The Incredibles, as the RLI troopers marched onto the parade square in divisions. Minister of Defence Jack Howman and Prime Minister Smith then arrived in turn to inspect the men, following which Smith presented Mrs Veronica Ferreira with her late husband Wally's posthumous Presidential commendation for bravery. The regimental colour was then trooped before finally the RLI men performed a march-past in slow and quick time. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parade,</b> Lieutenant-Colonel Hickman announced his departure from the Battalion, having been promoted; his replacement was Lieutenant-Colonel A. N. O. MacIntyre.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} route <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parade</b> is northward from Bowling Green to City Hall Park.
