5000|$|This concept, {{created by}} Hartmann, is {{grounded}} in her belief that equal pay for jobs of equal value. [...] "The general goal of a comparable worth strategy is pay equity—equitable <b>occupational</b> <b>wage</b> rates that are not influenced by the sex, race, or ethnicity of the incumbents." [...] (Comparable Worth, 4). She emphasized {{a certain type of}} wage discrimination that arises when a firm is substantially segregated by sex and the two groups are not performing the same sort of tasks, but tasks that are of [...] "comparable worth" [...] to the employer (Women, Work, and Wages 9). Hartmann's exploration of comparable worth forced her to not only look into the issue of wage gaps between men and women but also the significance of gender bias/sex segregation in employment. She defines sex segregation in the workplace as the concentration {{of men and women in}} different jobs that are predominantly of a single sex. Hartmann works towards a goal of complete integration, with different proportions of men and women within every occupation identical to their representation in the labor force as a whole. She points out, however, that due to differences between men and women deeply rooted in certain cultures, this goal may take decades to reach. Therefore, an appropriate policy goal would be to eliminate barriers in the way of women's full exercise of employment rights.|$|E
40|$|How does {{globalization}} affect inter-occupational wage inequality within countries? This paper empirically examines {{this issue}} {{by focusing on}} two dimensions of globalization, openness to trade and openness to capital, using a relatively new dataset on occupational wages. Estimates from dynamic models for 52 countries for the 1983 - 2002 period suggest that openness to trade contributes {{to an increase in}} <b>occupational</b> <b>wage</b> inequality within developed countries, but that the effect diminishes with an increased level of development. In the context of developing countries, the results suggest that the effect of openness to trade on wage inequality is insignificant and does not vary with the level of development. Our results also suggest that openness to capital does not affect <b>occupational</b> <b>wage</b> inequality in either developed or developing countries. openness to trade; openness to capital; foreign direct investment; <b>occupational</b> <b>wage</b> inequality; panel data; dynamic model...|$|E

40|$|An establishment’s average wage, {{computed}} from administrative wage data, {{has been found}} to be related to occupational wages. These occupational wages are a primary outcome variable for the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics survey. Mo-tivated by the fact that nonresponse in this survey is associated with average wage even after accounting for other establishment characteristics, we propose a method that uses the ad-ministrative data for imputing missing <b>occupational</b> <b>wage</b> values due to nonresponse. This imputation is complicated by the structure of the data. Since <b>occupational</b> <b>wage</b> data is collected in the form of counts of employees in predefined wage ranges for each occupation, weighting approaches to deal with nonresponse do not adequately adjust the estimates for certain domains of estimation. To preserve the current data structure, we propose a method to impute each missing establishment’s wage interval count data as an ordered multinomial random variable using a separate survival model for each occupation.

30|$|In Romania, the {{communist}} regime promoted an official policy of gender equality for more than 40  years, providing equal access to education and employment and restricting pay differentiation based on gender.

This paper analyzes both gender and <b>occupational</b> <b>wage</b> gaps before and during {{the first years of the}} transition to a market economy and finds that {{the communist}} institutions did succeed in eliminating the gender wage differences in female- and male-dominated occupations but not in gender-integrated occupations.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{inflation}} on wage changes made by firms in a unique thirty-seven-year panel of occupations and employers drawn from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Community Salary Survey (CSS). Our analysis first identifies two relative prices embedded in wage changes and, second, draws inferences about {{the costs and benefits}} of inflation from the adjustments in these relative prices. Typically, firms manage employer-wide wage adjustments (controlling for <b>occupational</b> <b>wage</b> changes) separately from their interoccupational wage changes (controlling for employer wage hikes). Consistent with this observation, we identify large independent employer and occupational components of wage changes in the CSS. Although there is no a priori reason why these adjustments should be altered by inflation (when the average change is subtracted out), we find that variation in both of these terms rises as inflation grows. Guided by institutional wage-setting procedures, we view employers' mean wage hikes as subject to intra-market variations in the speed of adjustment to inflation and forecasting errors. In contrast, we argue that <b>occupational</b> <b>wage</b> movements include a higher concentration of inter-market relative price adjustments. This simple dichotomy, whose robustness we attempt to test, yields two policy-oriented results. First, higher inflation and labor productivity appear to increase the rate of <b>occupational</b> <b>wage</b> adjustments ("grease"), although these potential benefits taper off after inflation rises to about 4 percent (assuming 1. 5 percent average growth of labor productivity.) Second, potentially inefficient variations in employer wage adjustments ("sand") continue to mount until inflation reaches rates of 7 to 10 percent (again assuming productivity growth of 1. 5 percent).

40|$|There {{are several}} {{theoretical}} reasons why globalization {{will have a}} narrowing as well as widening effect on the gender wage gap, but {{little is known about}} the actual impact, except for a number of country studies. The author provides a cross-country study of the impact of globalization on the <b>occupational</b> gender <b>wage</b> gap, based on the rarely used but most far-ranging survey of wages around the world, the International Labour Organization's October Inquiry. This annual survey was started in 1924 and contains a wealth of information on wages and the gender wage gap. For the period 1983 - 99, there is information on the gender wage gap in 161 narrowly defined occupations in more than 80 countries around the world. The author finds the following: (i) The <b>occupational</b> gender <b>wage</b> gap appears to be narrowing with increases inGDP per capita; (ii) There is a significantly narrowing impact of trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) net inflows on the <b>occupational</b> gender <b>wage</b> gap for low-skill occupations, both in poorer and richer countries, and for high-skill occupations in richer countries; (iii) There is no evidence of a narrowing impact of trade, but there is evidence of a widening impact of FDI net inflows on the high-skill <b>occupational</b> gender <b>wage</b> gap in poorer countries; (iv) Wage-setting institutions have a strong impact on the <b>occupational</b> gender <b>wage</b> gap in richer countries.
