5|$|Metanephrops challengeri is {{currently}} listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, {{due in part}} to the Quota Management System put in place by the New Zealand government.

Estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>population</b> size of M.challengeri vary depending on the methods used. Based on indirect measures, such as burrow counts, there may be as many as 28million individuals, and the annual catch might represent only 2%–4% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>population.</b> Using more reliable figures based on those animals seen during surveys, there may be only 2–11million individuals available to trawlers, and the annual catch may remove 12%–28% of that population.

[...] Higher rates of cribia orbitalia among females may indicate lesser health status, or greater survival of young females with cribia orbitalia into adulthood.|$|R
