5|$|The Galileo orbiter {{found that}} Europa has a weak {{magnetic}} moment, which is {{induced by the}} varying part of the Jovian magnetic field. The field strength at the magnetic equator (about 120 nT) created by this magnetic moment is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede's field and six times the value of Callisto's. The existence of the induced moment requires a layer <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> electrically conductive material in Europa's interior.

5|$|Birmingham's {{explosive}} {{industrial expansion}} started earlier {{than that of}} the textile-manufacturing towns of the North of England, and was driven by different factors. Instead of the economies of scale of a low-paid, unskilled workforce producing a single bulk commodity such as cotton or wool in large, mechanised units of production, Birmingham's industrial development was built on the adaptability and creativity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> paid workforce with a strong division of labour, practising a broad variety of skilled specialist trades and producing a constantly diversifying range of products, in a highly entrepreneurial economy of small, often self-owned workshops. This led to exceptional levels of inventiveness: between 1760 and 1850 – the core years of the Industrial Revolution – Birmingham residents registered over three times as many patents as those of any other British town or city.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{was born}} in a house called Southbourne, in the Edgbaston {{district}} of Birmingham, England, as the only son of the second marriage of Joseph Chamberlain, who later became Mayor of Birmingham, and who also served as a Cabinet minister. Joseph Chamberlain had fathered two children by his first marriage, Beatrice and Austen. Joseph's first wife, Harriet, died giving birth to Austen; Neville's mother, the former Florence Kenrick, also died in childbirth in 1875, when Neville was six years old. Florence Chamberlain left three daughters in addition to Neville and her stepchildren. Joseph Chamberlain, in the midst <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> successful parliamentary career, was often away, leaving the household in the hands of his sister. Young Neville was sent away to school at age eight.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's {{political}} career began in 1969, {{as an intern}} for Congressman William A. Steiger during the Richard Nixon Administration.

He held several positions {{in the years that}} followed: White House Staff Assistant in 1971, Assistant Director of the Cost of Living Council from 1971–73, and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974–1975. As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld, including use of the US Justice Department, that the Ford administration could use to limit damage from an article, published by The New York Times, in which investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> classified program, Operation Ivy Bells.|$|E

5|$|His opponents {{learned from}} Napoleon's innovations. The {{increased}} importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> mobile artillery force, {{the growth in}} artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As {{a result of these}} factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defenses, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers. Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century operational mobility underwent change.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Paraná {{was again}} {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Council of Ministers, at the head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> successful cabinet, and became the most powerful politician in the country. The electoral reform he ushered in was credited with undermining national political processes and causing severe harm to the system of parliamentary government. For his role in pushing through restructuring, Paraná met with fierce opposition from {{the majority of his}} colleagues, leading to a virtual split in the Conservative Party over his policies. On 3 September 1856, while still in office and {{at the height of his}} political career, he died unexpectedly of an unknown febrile condition. He is widely regarded by historians as one of the most influential statesmen of his time.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1945, the American force {{determined}} that two battalions of the Japanese 211th Regiment were at Hill 40, about four miles (6km) {{north of the}} Allied perimeter. The attack on this position began on 3 January 1945 when the 136th Infantry Regiment's 1st and 2nd battalions advanced from the south-west and encountered strong resistance. The regiment used a large quantity of ammunition in this attack, and aerial resupply was needed to replenish its supplies. Both American battalions resumed their attack {{the next day with}} the support <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> effective artillery bombardment, and reached the main Japanese position in the afternoon. During this period the 3rd Battalion of the 136th Regiment advanced on Hill 40 from the north, and destroyed the 211th Regiment's 3rd Battalion in a series of battles. This Japanese battalion had been stationed on the coast to receive supplies from Halmahera and mounted several unsuccessful attacks on the American battalion's beachhead after it landed in December.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominance}} of gangsta rap in mainstream hip-hop was supplanted in the late-2000s, {{largely due to}} the mainstream success of hip-hop artists such as Kanye West. The outcome <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> publicized sales competition between the simultaneous release of his and gangsta rapper 50 Cent's third studio albums, Graduation and Curtis respectively, has since been accredited to the decline. The competition resulted in record-breaking sales performances by both albums and West outsold 50 Cent, selling nearly a million copies of Graduation in the first week alone. Industry observers remark that West's victory over 50 Cent proved that rap music did not have to conform to gangsta-rap conventions in order to be commercially successful. West effectively paved the way for a new wave of hip-hop artists, including Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole, who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold and became platinum-selling artists.|$|E
5|$|The {{imperial}} {{courts of}} the emperor's palace {{were filled with}} his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist {{as well as a}} patron of the arts. A prime example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated for the release of his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north.|$|E
5|$|The {{thioredoxin}} system {{contains the}} 12-kDa protein thioredoxin and its companion thioredoxin reductase. Proteins related to thioredoxin {{are present in}} all sequenced organisms. Plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, have a particularly great diversity of isoforms. The active site of thioredoxin consists of two neighboring cysteines, as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> conserved CXXC motif, that can cycle between an active dithiol form (reduced) and an oxidized disulfide form. In its active state, thioredoxin acts as an efficient reducing agent, scavenging reactive oxygen species and maintaining other proteins in their reduced state. After being oxidized, the active thioredoxin is regenerated {{by the action of}} thioredoxin reductase, using NADPH as an electron donor.|$|E

5|$|Proteins are {{targeted}} for degradation by the proteasome with covalent modification of a lysine residue {{that requires the}} coordinated reactions of three enzymes. In the first step, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (known as E1) hydrolyzes ATP and adenylylates a ubiquitin molecule. This is then transferred to E1's active-site cysteine residue {{in concert with the}} adenylylation of a second ubiquitin. This adenylylated ubiquitin is then transferred to a cysteine of a second enzyme, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). In the last step, a member <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> diverse class of enzymes known as ubiquitin ligases (E3) recognizes the specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to this target protein. A target protein must be labeled with at least four ubiquitin monomers (in the form of a polyubiquitin chain) before it is recognized by the proteasome lid. It is therefore the E3 that confers substrate specificity to this system. The number of E1, E2, and E3 proteins expressed depends on the organism and cell type, but there are many different E3 enzymes present in humans, indicating that there is a huge number of targets for the ubiquitin proteasome system.|$|E
5|$|The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are {{typically}} fringed with tentilla ("little tentacles"), {{although a few}} genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and {{is attached to the}} head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.|$|E
