5|$|Though these larger {{philosophical}} {{traditions are}} clear influences on The Age of Reason, Paine owes the greatest intellectual {{debt to the}} English deists of the early eighteenth century, such as Peter Annet. John Toland had argued {{for the use of}} reason in interpreting scripture, Matthew Tindal had argued against revelation, Middleton had described the Bible as mythology and questioned the existence <b>of</b> <b>miracles,</b> Thomas Morgan had disputed the claims of the Old Testament, Thomas Woolston had questioned the believability <b>of</b> <b>miracles</b> and Thomas Chubb had maintained that Christianity lacked morality. All of these arguments appear in The Age of Reason, albeit less coherently.|$|E
5|$|Bede's scriptural commentaries {{employed}} the allegorical {{method of interpretation}} and his history includes accounts <b>of</b> <b>miracles,</b> which to modern historians has seemed at odds with his critical approach to the materials in his history. Modern studies have shown the important role such concepts played in the world-view of Early Medieval scholars.|$|E

5|$|Maximus {{is among}} those Christians who were venerated as saints shortly after their deaths. The vindication of Maximus' {{theological}} position made him extremely popular within a generation after his death, and his cause was aided by the accounts <b>of</b> <b>miracles</b> at his tomb. In the Roman Catholic Church the veneration of Maximus began prior to {{the foundation of the}} Congregation for the Causes of Saints.|$|E
5|$|Richard Swinefield, Cantilupe's {{successor}} as Bishop of Hereford, {{wrote to}} Pope Nicholas IV {{in a letter}} dated 19 April 1290 proposing the bishop for canonisation, {{but it was not}} until 1307 that an investigation into Cantilupe's saintliness was initiated by Pope Clement V. For the canonisation process to succeed, convincing evidence <b>of</b> <b>miracles</b> that Cantilupe had performed since his death had to be presented, one of which was that William Cragh had been brought back from the dead by the bishop's intercession. Three papal commissioners were appointed to conduct the inquiry: William de Testa, a papal tax collector in England, Ralph Baldock, Bishop of London, and William Durand the Younger, Bishop of Mende.|$|E
5|$|The author {{starts with}} Basavanna's birth and weaves episodes of other famous sharanas (devotees of Hindu god Shiva)—such as Allama Prabhu—into his life history. Basavanna is {{depicted}} as a saintly person, a great devotee of Shiva, an incarnation of Nandi, a man <b>of</b> <b>miracles</b> and one with a mission, sent to re-establish the Veerashaiva faith on earth. The work is arranged into eight aswasas (divisions) containing sixty-one sandhis (chapters) and 3,621 verses. The narration includes stories of devotees of Shiva who overcame their egos. Apart from a few variations, the writings of Bhima Kavi and his predecessors are complementary. Two lost works of Bhima Kavi are the Bhimakaviswara Ragale and the Bhringidandaka.|$|E

5|$|A Ricci {{painting}} of the Last Supper was above the main altar, which was dedicated to Jesus the Redeemer; in 1662, a fresco of the Madonna was moved there. The Ardicini cardinals had the image painted on the facade of their palace in Borgo Sant'Angelo, and it was venerated by the local people because of a number <b>of</b> <b>miracles</b> attributed to her intercession. On the altar was an African-marble tabernacle by Giovanni Battista Ciolli, {{and to the right}} of the entrance was a holy water font presented to the church in 1589 by Francesco Del Sodo (a member of the archconfraternity). The church was the burial place of several people, whose tombstones adorned the floor; among them were the son and mother-in-law of Pirro Ligorio and Battista Gerosa, son of the Oratory of San Sebastiano architect Antonio Gerosa.|$|E
5|$|Hazrath Shahul Hamid Badusha Kaadiri {{was born}} to Syed Hassan Kuthos Baba Kaadiri and Bibi Fathima at Manikpur, in Pratapgarh {{district}} of Uttar Pradesh. He was a 13th generation descendant of the renowned Sufi saint, Muhiyudin Abd al-Qadir al-Jalani. He had his Islamic education at Gwalior {{under the guidance of}} Mohammad Ghouse. He left on a pilgrimage to Mecca and then moved to Maldives, Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu with his spiritual team. Historians Sayyid and Qadir Hussain (1957) place the date of his birth on 10 November 1504, death on 10 November 1570 and arrival in Nagore during 1533–34. Other sources mention the year of death as 1558, 1570 or 1579. He is believed to have led a simple and pious life, performing a lot <b>of</b> <b>miracles,</b> giving him the name Nagore Andavar (meaning god of Nagore). His popularity grew outside Tanjore region during the period. He was also called Meera Saheb, Qadir Wali and Ganj-e-Sawai.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to common Christian festivals like Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter, the community celebrates many other festivals {{of religious and}} historical significance. Monti Fest {{is one of the}} major festivals, celebrated on 8 September. It combines the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and blessing of Novem (new crops). The festival derives its name from the Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet in South Canara, and was initiated by Fr. Joachim Miranda, a Goan Catholic priest at Farangipet, in 1763. Although Tipu Sultan destroyed the churches of Canara, he spared Monte Mariano Church in deference to the friendship of his father Hyder Ali with Fr. Miranda. Attur Jatre or Attur Fest (Attur festival) is the feast of St. Lawrence, celebrated in the St. Lawrence Shrine on the outskirts of Karkala in South Canara. This shrine, in existence since 1759, is said to have a history <b>of</b> <b>miracles.</b> Evkaristik Purshanv (Eucharistic Procession) is an annual religious procession led by the Bishop of Mangalore from Milagres Church to Rosario Cathedral. The procession, held on the first Sunday of the New Year of the Gregorian calendar, seeks blessings for the new year.|$|E

5|$|Reformers {{attached}} {{great importance}} to the elevation and translation of saints, moving their bodies from their initial resting place to a higher and more prominent location {{to make them more}} accessible for veneration. An important precursor was the seventh-century translation of the remains of St Benedict himself from Monte Cassino to Fleury Abbey. By the tenth century, translation usually involved a grand procession, an elaborate new shrine and often reconstruction of the church. Almost nothing is known of the life of Swithun, who was an obscure ninth-century Bishop of Winchester until Æthelwold launched a major cult of him as a saint, and translated his grave from outside the Old Minster to a new shrine inside. After Æthelwold's own death in 984 his progress to becoming the subject of a cult followed the conventional path: his grave {{is said to have been}} neglected until he appeared in a vision to say that his body should be moved, and his successor Ælfheah then built a new choir to hold his body, where it became the focus <b>of</b> <b>miracles.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} renamed Moonlight when {{picked up by}} CBS on May 14, 2007, prior the upfronts. David Greenwalt, creator <b>of</b> <b>Miracles</b> and co-creator of Angel, joined the staff in May 2007 as showrunner and {{executive}} producer alongside Silver. CBS hired Greenwalt during the pilot process to restructure the original concept by Koslow and Munson, however health reasons forced {{him to leave the}} series, and Chip Johannessen took over showrunner duties in August 2007. All of the original actors save for the lead role of Mick St. John were recast in June 2007: Shannon Lucio, Rade Šerbedžija and Amber Valletta were originally cast in the roles of Beth Turner, Josef Kostan and Coraline Duvall respectively before Sophia Myles, Jason Dohring and Shannyn Sossamon replaced them. With an almost entirely different cast, a retooled, full-length pilot for television audiences was re-shot. To promote the series, Silver, {{along with the rest of}} the main cast, attended the Comic-Con International in San Diego on July 27, 2007, where the show was featured.|$|E
5|$|Indira Parthasarathy's Nandan Kathai (1978) {{builds the}} tale of Nandanar (referred in the work as Nandan) further, {{introducing}} two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, who are as ruthless as Bharati's Vediyar. Nandanar is portrayed as a lover of art, rather than God. He {{wants to see the}} cosmic dance of Nataraja. A Devadasi called Abhirami also appears; no significant female characters are found in earlier narratives. Indira is blunt in reprimanding the Dalits for not understanding Nandanar. Nandan Kathai is a quest for liberation of Dalits and women alike. Unlike earlier narratives, Indira's tale is devoid <b>of</b> <b>miracles</b> and is a story of how Nandanar falls prey to a conspiracy. The Vediyar-priest, the Vediyar-landlord and the two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, hatch a plot to end Nandan. They make Nandanar believe that God harvested crop from the field, an allusion to the miracle of Vediyar's impossible task in Bharati's work. Then, they persuade him to organize a dance contest between Bharatnatyam, the high-caste elites' dance and the folk dance of the Dalits. Finally, in the climax, Nandanar agrees to undergo a fire-trial, reassured by the earlier miracle, but he and Abhirami burn in the flames. The upper castes succeed in sending a warning to Dalits how trespassers of the caste code, longing for salvation, would be punished.|$|E

5|$|Trevor Munson {{conceived}} {{the character of}} Mick Angel in 2004 and spent {{two and a half}} years writing a novel featuring the character. The story was adapted into a feature film script, and Bruce Willis was considered as a possibility for the lead role. The script was shown to Nina Tassler at CBS, who paired Munson with Ron Koslow, creator of Beauty and the Beast, to rewrite the script as a television series. The series was titled Twilight, and Koslow and Munson wrote the pilot, which Warner Bros. Television initially commissioned as a presentation lasting 14–20 minutes in January 2007. Joel Silver and Gerard Bocaccio were hired to be executive producers on the project under the former's production banner, Silver Pictures, in the same month. Alex O'Loughlin and Shannon Lucio were cast in the presentation, and Rod Holcomb was hired as director. The project was renamed Moonlight when picked up by CBS on May 14, 2007, prior the upfronts.

25|$|The {{criterion}} for assessing a belief system for Hume {{is based on}} the balance of probability whether something is more likely than not to have occurred. Since the weight of empirical experience contradicts the notion for the existence <b>of</b> <b>miracles,</b> such accounts should be treated with scepticism. Further, the myriad of accounts <b>of</b> <b>miracles</b> contradict one another, as some people who receive miracles will aim to prove the authority of Jesus, whereas others will aim to prove the authority of Muhammad or some other religious prophet or deity. These various differing accounts weaken the overall evidential power <b>of</b> <b>miracles.</b>|$|E
