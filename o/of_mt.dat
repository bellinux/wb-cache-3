40|$|Abstract: Metallothioneins (MTs) are a {{group of}} low {{molecular}} mass, cysteine-rich proteins {{with a variety of}} functions including involvement in metal homeostasis, free radical scavenging, protection against heavy metal damage, and meta-bolic regulation via Zn donation. The overexpression <b>of</b> <b>MTs</b> in proliferating cells is turning the attention to the study <b>of</b> <b>MTs</b> as novel promising marker of tumor diseases. Besides, levels <b>of</b> <b>MTs</b> in invertebrates and aquatic vertebrates well correlate with heavy metal pollution of an environment and, thus, serve as bio-environmental marker. It is not surprising that these proteins are of great interest not only for biochemists, molecular biologists clinical chemists, but also for envi-ronmental chemists and ecologists. Detection and quantification <b>of</b> <b>MTs,</b> which is needed in all above mentioned areas, is challenging due to the high cysteine content and relatively low molecular mass.

In budding cells, most MTs are nucleated by three to six small and motile -tubulin–containing MTOCs at the boundary of mother and daughter cell, which results in a polarized MT array.
