5|$|Prior to independence, {{there had}} <b>only</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> few {{scattered}} Dutch farmers {{settled on the}} Hudson above Albany. In 1787, a group of New Englanders headed west and persuaded one Jacob Vanderhyden to sell them a large tract which they then subdivided and named Troy.

5|$|On 14 October 1952, IX Corps {{launched}} an offensive, Operation Showdown, intended {{to improve its}} defensive lines by capturing a complex of hills and force Chinese lines back. This complex included Pike's Peak, Jane Russell Hill, Sandy Hill, and Triangle Hill, northeast of Kumhwa. The 7th Infantry Division advanced, encountering resistance from the 15th Chinese Field Army. In the ensuing Battle of Triangle Hill, the four hills were captured and recaptured by both sides {{several times in the}} heaviest fighting that year. Eventually, the UN forces withdrew having been unsuccessful in capturing their objectives. UN forces suffered 9,000 killed and the Chinese suffered 19,000 killed or wounded during the fighting. The result of the battle had <b>only</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> slight improvement in IX Corps' positions, as Chinese positions had been too well fortified for the UN forces to take and hold the ground. For the remainder of the year, US and Chinese forces both conducted a series of smaller raids on each other's lines, avoiding major conflicts, as armistice negotiations continued unsuccessfully. In November, the Chinese {{launched an}}other offensive to retake ground lost during these operations, which was again repulsed by UN forces.|$|E
5|$|The Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) (Assemblies and Processions) Rules {{made under}} the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act require a permit for any public {{assembly}} or procession {{of five or}} more persons in any public place. The rationale given for this law is that {{a large group of}} people who gather for a peaceful purpose can turn violent. In the 1950s and 1960s there were several violent riots in Singapore, the last incident being the 1964 race riots in which 36 people were killed. Although there have <b>only</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> few minor protests since then, the authorities continue to take a tough stance against unlicensed outdoor protests. On 31 December 2000, 15 members of Falun Gong consisting of 13 foreigners and two Singaporeans were arrested at MacRitchie Park for holding an illegal assembly.|$|E

NFL regulations allow the team to use the blue jersey up to two times in any given season. In all other games, the team must wear either their white or black jerseys; in NFL games, the home team decides whether to wear a dark or white jersey, while the away team wears the opposite. The Panthers typically pair their white jerseys with white pants, while the black and blue jerseys are paired with silver pants; there have <b>only</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> few exceptions to these combinations.|$|E
5|$|Wine {{has been}} {{produced}} in Oregon since the Oregon Territory was {{settled in the}} 1840s; however, winemaking has <b>only</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> significant industry in the state since the 1960s. Grapes were first planted in the Oregon Territory in 1847. Valley View,the first recorded winery, was established by Peter Britt in the late 1850s in Jacksonville. Throughout the 19th century, there was experimentation with various varietals by immigrants to the state. In 1904, an Oregon winemaker won a prize at the St. Louis World's Fair. Wine production stopped in the United States during Prohibition. As in other states, the Oregon wine industry lay dormant for thirty years after Prohibition was repealed.|$|E
5|$|With Speaker Schuyler Colfax’ {{election}} to the Vice Presidency in 1868, {{the leadership of the}} House became vacant. Blaine had <b>only</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> member of Congress since 1863, but he had developed a reputation for parliamentary skill and, aside from a growing feud with Roscoe Conkling of New York, was popular with his fellow Republicans. He was elected with the unanimous vote of the Republican members {{at the start of the}} 41st Congress in March 1869. Blaine was an effective Speaker with a magnetic personality. Moreover, President Ulysses S. Grant valued his skill and loyalty in leading the House. He enjoyed the job and made his presence in Washington more permanent by buying a large residence on Fifteenth Street in the city. At the same time, the Blaine family moved to a mansion in Augusta.|$|E

5|$|The {{squadron}} {{selected for}} the reinforcement of Egypt was placed {{under the command of}} Contre-amiral Honoré Ganteaume, a survivor of the Battle of the Nile and therefore an officer with experience of service in the Eastern Mediterranean. Under Ganteaume's command were three 80-gun and four 74-gun ships of the line, two frigates and a lugger which between them carried 5,000 troops as reinforcements for the Army in Egypt under General Jean Sahuguet. Rumours were spread that the expedition was destined for the Caribbean to oppose the Haitian Revolution, and demonstrations were arranged at every French Atlantic and Channel port, intended to confuse the British blockade squadrons as to which ships were actually sailing and which were only giving the impression of doing so. Ganteaume's squadron was ordered to sail from Brest on 7 January 1801, but the diversion plan was not successful, as the British squadron that was permanently maintained off Brest under Rear-Admiral Henry Harvey immediately gave chase to Ganteauame's ships as they emerged from the Passage du Raz. Within hours, Ganteaume had been forced to take shelter under the batteries {{at the mouth of the}} River Vilaine, pretending that his voyage had <b>only</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> feint like the other operations along the coast. A few days later he managed to slip back into Brest harbour.|$|E

25|$|Based on {{the current}} rate of {{increase}} - averaging about 2ppm per year - greenhouse gas concentrations are likely to reach 400ppm by 2016, 450ppm by 2041, and 550ppm by around 2091. It is because of this that environmental organisations and some political parties criticised the 60% target as being insufficiently ambitious, and why they demanded greater cuts (80%-100%), as mentioned below. The exclusion of emissions from aviation and shipping, combined with forecasts for growth in these areas, also means that the net effect of the bill would actually have <b>only</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> 35-50% total cut on 1990 levels by 2050.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of a Vril-Society was alleged in 1960 by Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels. In their book The Morning of the Magicians, they claimed that the Vril-Society was a secret community of occultists in pre-Nazi Berlin that {{was a sort of}} inner circle of the Thule Society. They also thought that it was in close contact with the English group known as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Vril information takes up about a tenth of the volume, the remainder of which details other esoteric speculations, but the authors fail to clearly explain whether this section is fact or fiction. Historians have shown that there has been no actual historical foundation for the claims of Pauwels and Bergier, and that the article of Willy Ley has <b>only</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> vague inspiration for their own ideas. Nevertheless, Pauwels and Bergier have influenced a whole new literary genre dealing with the alleged occult influences on National Socialism which have often been related to the fictional Vril Society.|$|E
