5|$|An <b>ouster</b> {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of <b>ouster</b> clause is the total <b>ouster</b> or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue that}} has {{undergone}} academic scrutiny {{is the nature of}} section8B(2) as an <b>ouster</b> clause. An <b>ouster</b> clause is an objectively worded provision which is drafted to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts.|$|E
5|$|Unlike a total <b>ouster</b> or {{finality}} clause {{which seeks}} to preclude judicial review entirely, a partial <b>ouster</b> or time limit clause specifies a restricted period of time after which no remedy will be available. Such clauses are generally effective, unless the public authority has acted in bad faith, {{in which case the}} decision impugned may be subject to judicial review even though the time permitted for challenging it has lapsed.|$|E
50|$|The Hegemony {{is opposed}} by the <b>Ousters,</b> renegade human colonies that fled the Hegemony's growing {{influence}} even before {{the events of the}} Hegira. Though seen by many Hegemony citizens as barbarians, the <b>Ousters</b> have a highly advanced culture that focuses primarily on the fine arts and on aesthetic values almost unknown amidst the many technologies of the WorldWeb. The <b>Ousters</b> have mutated physically, believing that they should adapt to their outer-space surroundings rather than adapt the surroundings themselves, {{as was the case with}} WorldWeb planets, and appear in a variety of forms throughout the course of the novel. The <b>Ousters</b> have rarely fought full-scale conflicts with the Hegemony, but are launching an invasion of Hyperion at the time of the novel.|$|R
50|$|Darkeden is a hack-and-slash game, which {{requires}} {{the players to}} kill hordes of monsters {{in order to make}} their character progress. This character progression varies according to the different races. Slayers only have to attack a monster or player to gain experience points. Vampires need to kill a monster or player and drink its blood to gain {{the full extent of the}} experience points available. <b>Ousters</b> just have to kill to gain these points. For the same monster, <b>ousters</b> gain more experience points out of them than vampires do even when drinking their blood. This is an aspect of the balanced system present in the game between the races having each a special advantage: the slayers sell the heads and skulls of monsters (one of the ways to make money in the game) at the highest prices to npc, the vampires drop the best items out of the 3 races, and the <b>ousters</b> get experience points the quickest.|$|R
5000|$|... 1989-1997—Dan Simmons Hyperion Cantos is {{a series}} of four books {{featuring}} a faction known as the <b>Ousters,</b> which use pantropy as a way of living in harmony with nature and space.|$|R
5|$|It {{has also}} been argued that by {{introducing}} an <b>ouster</b> clause into the ISA, an externally imposed restraint on the judiciary, Parliament has exhibited distrust towards the judiciary's ability to exercise self-restraint in dealing with ISA cases.|$|E
5|$|The Court neither {{expressly}} rejected nor {{affirmed the}} abolition of the distinction in Anisminic and its effect on the effectiveness of <b>ouster</b> clauses. Instead, the Court cited UK authorities holding that <b>ouster</b> clauses are ineffective when there has been an absence of jurisdiction or an excess of jurisdiction {{on the part of the}} decision-maker, a position which characterized the law prior to Anisminic. The Court did refer to Anisminic but only to observe that the House of Lords had held the <b>ouster</b> clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could not be considered a real determination and had no effect at all. Ultimately, the Court quashed the order made by the Industrial Arbitration Court because it contained an error of law which had caused that court to exceed its jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|At least 70 {{people were}} wounded when {{hundreds}} of residents attacked {{the police station}} in Khargah to demand the <b>ouster</b> of a police official who {{had a reputation for}} heavy-handedness. Police then opened fire on the protesters. Authorities said that 11 people had been killed. The United Nations estimated deaths at more than 300.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} time periods that regulate the battles in Helea. The first period takes place between 9h and 16h59 {{which is called}} day time or full day. During that period, vampires are at their weakest and slayers and <b>ousters</b> {{have the upper hand}} on them. The second time period happens between 21h and 4h59 which is night time or full night. It is during that lapse of time that vampires are the most efficient and cause the most damage to their preys. Finally, the periods comprised between 5h - 8h59 and 17h - 20h59 are the transition time during which slayers, <b>ousters</b> and vampires fight on the same ground. This system offers a very balanced game-play as a vampire can be completely annihilated by day time by a said slayer while when night time comes, this same vampire could dispose of him or her pretty easily (granted they are in the same range of levels). This time effect doesn't concern <b>ousters</b> vs slayers fights but it does with monsters who are considered [...] "vampires".|$|R
50|$|Later, {{an ancient}} race of people {{known as the}} <b>Ousters</b> awakens from their long sleep and are shocked {{to see what the}} vampires and humans have done to Helea. They begin to attempt to wipe them from the area.|$|R
5000|$|Cardinal Simon Augustino Lourdusamy, a prelate and the Vatican's Secretary of State, is the {{effective}} {{head of the}} Catholic Church and the dominant force behind Pope Urban XVI. Lourdusamy masterminds the search for Aenea and plans the crusade against the <b>Ousters</b> with Urban's approval.|$|R
5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the exercise of executive power. Typically, this has been done though the insertion of finality or total <b>ouster</b> clauses into Acts of Parliament, or by wording powers conferred by Acts on decision-makers subjectively. Finality clauses are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom. The courts there have taken the view that such clauses are, subject to some exceptions, not effective in denying or restricting {{the extent to which}} the courts are able to exercise judicial review. In contrast, Singapore cases suggest that <b>ouster</b> clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power where authorities have committed jurisdictional errors of law, but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E
5|$|A partial <b>ouster</b> or {{time limit}} clause {{specifies}} a restricted period, after which no remedy will be available. Such clauses are generally effective, unless the public authority has acted in bad faith. Similarly, {{the existence of}} bad faith entitles applicants to challenge decisions of authorities despite the existence of statutory provisions declaring such decisions to be conclusive evidence of certain facts. In the absence of bad faith, the courts will enforce conclusive evidence clauses.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, in {{accordance}} with the political strategy, Minh's junta was reluctant to carry out large-scale offensives, which concerned the Americans, particularly Harkins, Taylor and CIA chief John McCone. While Harkins and Taylor had opposed Diệm's <b>ouster,</b> the junta's policies also disappointed many supporters of the anti-Diệm coup as they saw regime change as necessary to their hopes of a more aggressive anti-communist war. For their part, Minh's leadership group believed that a more low-key military approach was needed for their political campaign against the insurgency.|$|E
5000|$|Hyperion (1989) and The Fall of Hyperion (1990), {{the first}} two novels in the Hyperion Cantos written by Dan Simmons. Martin Silenus, the Poet of the Hyperion tales, survives {{tortured}} formative years {{growing up in the}} ambit of the marginally effective Rifkin Atmospheric Protectorate on Heaven’s Gate, [...] "a minor world circling the star Vega ... a poisonous world however a farcaster connection to Sol System ..." [...] Too late for poor Martin, Heaven's gate is terraformed by the Hegemony of Man into an Edenic garden planet, and kept that way in the face of considerable difficulty thanks to its rich mineral resources—until the collapse of the farcaster network and the fall of the Hegemony. In the apocalypse, [...] "...the worst has happened ... The <b>Ousters</b> are invading the Web. Heaven’s Gate is being destroyed ...". The once beautiful world is reverted by TechnoCore cybrids posing as <b>Ousters</b> into a smoldering slag heap.|$|R
50|$|In January 2014, Schiller joined Twitter as Head of News with {{responsibility}} for expanding the platform’s relationships with news organizations. In July 2014, Global Media Head Katie Stanton expanded Schiller’s responsibilities to Chair of Global News for the company including setting strategy for partnerships with journalists around the world. Schiller left Twitter in October as part of CEO Dick Costolo ongoing series of strategic pivots and executive changes and <b>ousters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The story concludes {{several months}} later; {{the worst of}} the chaos caused by the fall has abated, and Hyperion is flourishing again, with former Hegemony {{citizens}} and <b>Ousters</b> co-existing. Newly substantiated glyphs give some insight to the various tombs and monoliths of the Time Tombs, and, rarely, the portal to the future will admit a person. The novel ends with the Consul returning to the former Web Worlds in his starship to discover what happened, with Severn's artificial intelligence stored in his ship.|$|R
5|$|Disorder spread {{throughout}} Aleppo {{the morning after}} Mansur's flight. Aleppines looted Mansur's palace, taking some 80,000 gold dinars-worth of property. The medieval Aleppine chronicler Ibn al-Adim further noted that 28,000 volumes of manuscripts stored in the palace library were lost. A number of Christian and Jewish homes were also plundered. Though actual members of the Hamdanid dynasty had lost power by 1002, many contemporary Arabic chroniclers consider Mansur's <b>ouster</b> to represent the formal end of the Hamdanid emirate.|$|E
5|$|Due to his partial {{defense of}} Khrushchev during his <b>ouster,</b> Mikoyan lost his high {{standing}} with the new Soviet leadership. The Politburo forced Mikoyan to retire from his seat in the Politburo due to old age. Mikoyan quickly also lost his post as head of state and was succeeded in this post by Nikolai Podgorny on 9 December 1965. Brezhnev officialised Mikoyan's retirement by awarding him an Order of Lenin.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, he sat {{as one of}} the senator-judges in the {{impeachment}} trial of his ally, President Joseph Estrada. He w{{as one of the}} eleven votes during the trial that successfully voted to block the opening of an envelope that was believed to contain proof of the corruption charges against Estrada. Public anger over the Senate vote triggered the EDSA Revolution of 2001, leading to the <b>ouster</b> of Estrada and the accession of Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to the presidency.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{the arrival}} of a new {{canonical}} leader of Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Volodymyr (Viktor Sabodan), elected at the Kharkiv sinod, where Filaret was <b>oustered</b> from his position as head of that church, Volodymyr and several thousand believers who gathered to meet him, encountered a heavily guarded cathedral surrounded by riot police and UNA - UNSO paramilitary members which barricaded themselves in the church. [...] Bloodshed in front of the cathedral was avoided when Metropolitan Volodymyr turned the crowd away from the cathedral.|$|R
25|$|The {{long-term}} {{viability of the}} Spurs franchise in San Antonio was, however, achieved during the 1999–2000 season, as Bexar County voters approved increases in car rental and hotel taxes which would allow {{for the construction of}} a new arena next to the Freeman Coliseum. The Spurs finished with 58–24 records for both the 2000–01 and 2001–02 seasons but found themselves suffering playoff <b>ousters</b> in both seasons from the eventual NBA Champion Los Angeles Lakers, getting swept from the 2001 Conference Finals and losing in five games during the second round in 2002.|$|R
50|$|DarkEden is a free-to-play massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing {{computer game}} in isometric projection or 3/4 perspective developed {{and published by}} SOFTON. The game has a horror theme based on a war between humans (Slayers), vampires and <b>Ousters</b> in a region called Helea located in a fictional country of Eastern Europe known as Eslania. The original version of the game, and the most advanced one, is the Korean one from which several other versions have been derived from such as the Japanese, Chinese, Thai and International versions. The Thai and international versions are currently closed.|$|R
5|$|When Khánh {{heard of}} his <b>ouster,</b> he {{declared}} {{it to be}} illegal. After defying his colleagues and travelling {{around the country for}} a day in a fruitless attempt to rally support for a comeback, Khánh went into exile after being named to fill the meaningless post of Ambassador-at-Large and allowed an elaborate ceremonial military send-off to save face. Phát and Thảo were later sentenced to death in absentia. Thảo was hunted down and killed in July 1965, while Phát remained on the run for several years before turning himself in and being pardoned.|$|E
5|$|A {{collective}} {{leadership was}} founded immediately after Khrushchev's <b>ouster,</b> consisting of Brezhnev as First Secretary, Kosygin {{as head of}} government, and Anastas Mikoyan (and later Nikolai Podgorny) as head of state. From the beginning, Suslov was a vocal critic of one-man rule such as that seen under Joseph Stalin and Khrushchev. While he condemned Stalin's one-man rule, he equally criticised the individualistic assertiveness of Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation policy. A strong supporter of democratic centralism, Suslov prevented Brezhnev from taking over Kosygin's post as head of government in 1970. Kirilenko, Brezhnev, and Suslov were members of an unofficial Troika within the Communist Party leadership.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} no desire {{for a change in}} the form of {{government}} among most Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. PedroII had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his <b>ouster</b> to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent {{the last two years of}} his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.|$|E
50|$|The {{long-term}} {{viability of the}} Spurs franchise in San Antonio was, however, achieved during the 1999-2000 season, as Bexar County voters approved increases in car rental and hotel taxes which would allow {{for the construction of}} a new arena next to the Freeman Coliseum. The Spurs finished with 58-24 records for both the 2000-01 and 2001-02 seasons but found themselves suffering playoff <b>ousters</b> in both seasons from the eventual NBA Champion Los Angeles Lakers, getting swept from the 2001 Conference Finals and losing in five games during the second round in 2002.|$|R
5000|$|Brawne Lamia, Martin Silenus and the Consul {{were the}} only {{surviving}} Pilgrims that stayed on Hyperion. The Consul left shortly and joined the <b>Ousters.</b> His fate is uncertain. Brawne Lamia, pregnant from the first John Keats technological reincarnation, gave birth shortly after to a daughter called Aenea. Lamia died when Aenea was still a girl, and Silenus {{took care of the}} child. When Aenea was twelve years old, she entered the [...] "Time Tomb" [...] and disappeared. Silenus hid in his home and began cryonic hibernation to wait for her return.|$|R
5000|$|The Hegemony {{itself is}} a largely decadent society, relying on its {{military}} to incorporate into the WorldWeb the colony planets, even unwillingly, and to defend the Hegemony from attacks by the <b>Ousters,</b> [...] "interstellar barbarians" [...] who dwell free of and {{beyond the bounds of}} the Hegemony and shun all the works of the TechnoCore (especially farcasters). Ostensibly a direct democracy governed through the [...] "All Thing" [...] forum, the Hegemony is also managed by a chief executive officer advised by the TechnoCore advisory council and the Hegemony Senate.|$|R
5|$|Around 1843, Kogălniceanu's {{enthusiasm for}} change was {{making him a}} suspect to the Moldavian authorities, and his lectures on History were {{suspended}} in 1844. His passport was revoked while he was traveling to Vienna as the secret representative of the Moldavian political opposition (attempting to approach Metternich and discuss Sturdza's <b>ouster).</b> Briefly imprisoned after returning to Iași, he soon after became involved in political agitation in Wallachia, assisting his friend Ion Ghica: in February, during a Romantic nationalist celebration, he traveled to Bucharest, where he met members of the secretive Frăția organization and of its legal front, Soțietatea Literară (including Ghica, Nicolae Bălcescu, August Treboniu Laurian, Alexandru G. Golescu, and C. A. Rosetti).|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, Barre's regime had become {{increasingly}} unpopular. The authorities became ever more totalitarian, and resistance movements, encouraged by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration, sprang {{up across the}} country. This eventually led in 1991 to {{the outbreak of the}} civil war, the toppling of Barre's government, and the disbandment of the Somali National Army. Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the <b>ouster</b> of Barre's regime. Armed factions led by United Somali Congress commanders General Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.|$|E
5|$|However, the Americans {{were not}} {{counting}} on Thảo {{and his fellow}} Catholic Phát trying to seize power on an explicitly religious platform, claiming fidelity to slain former Catholic President Ngô Đình Diệm and promising to recall Khiêm from the US to lead the new regime. This caused alarm among the Buddhist majority, who had campaigned heavily against Diệm's discriminatory religious policies {{in the months leading}} up to his <b>ouster</b> in November 1963. Although they wanted Khánh gone, the Americans did not want Thảo and Phát to succeed, so they sought out Kỳ and Thi in an attempt to have them defeat the original coup and then depose Khánh. During the initial attack, Thảo and Phát tried to capture both Khánh and Kỳ, but both men escaped narrowly, although some of their colleagues in the Armed Forces Council were arrested. Although the rebels were able to take control of Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the largest in the country and the military headquarters of South Vietnam, Kỳ was able to regroup quickly and retain control of the nearby Bien Hoa Air Base, using it to mobilize air power and stop the rebel advance with threats of bombing. Late in the night, Thảo and Phát met Kỳ in a meeting arranged by the Americans, where an agreement was reached for the coup to be ended in return for Khánh's <b>ouster.</b> By early next morning, the bloodless military action was over as Thảo and Phát went into hiding, and the junta voted to sack their leader Khánh, who was absent on a military inspection tour, thinking that Kỳ and Thi were on his side.|$|E
50|$|In 2852 the AI TechnoCore's treachery was uncovered: {{they had}} been using the Farcasters {{as part of a}} giant computer; {{connecting}} each human who passed through a portal to their neural net to increase its processing power as needed. The Hegemony CEO Meina Gladstone was also told that the TechnoCore resided within the WorldWeb itself; the dimensionless space between Farcaster Portals. When it was revealed that the supposed invasion by the <b>Ousters</b> was actually being perpetrated by the TechnoCore, CEO Gladstone decided to destroy every singularity sphere in the WorldWeb - supposedly severing the TechnoCore's link to humanity.|$|R
5000|$|The ConsulThe Consul is a Hegemony diplomat {{whose home}} world, Maui Covenant, was invaded by FORCE during his youth. His {{grandparents}} sparked an unsuccessful but legendary rebellion against Hegemony rule, {{but his father}} became a Hegemony senator, and the Consul followed his father into the governmental structures of the entity that drastically changed their homeland. The Consul remains bitter toward the Hegemony, and has served as an erstwhile agent of the <b>Ousters</b> at times. He believes that {{he is responsible for}} the [...] "opening" [...] of the Time Tombs, due to actions he took while serving as consul on Hyperion.|$|R
5000|$|Severn's character, {{the second}} [...] "cybrid" [...] of John Keats, is {{introduced}} {{at the beginning}} of the novel, at a formal event at Government House on Tau Ceti Center, the primary world of the Hegemony. Here, he claims to be an artist attached to Gladstone's staff in an attempt to provide an artistic view of the beginning of the war for Hyperion, which is under attack by the <b>Ousters.</b> At the event, senior Hegemony officials observe a FORCE fleet departing for the Hyperion stellar system, after which Severn accepts the invitation to dinner of a colorful socialite, Lady Diana Philomel.|$|R
