40|$|Geographies <b>of</b> <b>sexualities</b> {{started to}} develop within the Anglo-American {{academic}} context {{during the late}} 1980 s. In the 1990 s, propelled by the cultural turn, the swelling of post-structuralist and postmodern critiques, and a growing recognition of the limitations to scientific knowledge production and representation, geographers <b>of</b> <b>sexualities</b> introduced queer theory into human geography. Queer theory provided human geography with powerful tools for approaching not only straightforward spatialities <b>of</b> <b>sexualities,</b> but this new lens contributed {{to the development of}} human geographies as such. Currently, at least in the Anglo-Saxon geographical context, the field <b>of</b> geographies <b>of</b> <b>sexualities</b> is considered part of mainstream human geography. Therefore, the main goal of this thesis is to provide a few lines of reasoning for the development <b>of</b> geographies <b>of</b> <b>sexualities</b> in Czechia and Central Eastern Europe (CEE) and introduction of post-structuralist understandings, specifically queer theory. In contrast to other phenomena that may be locally exclusive or particular, human sexualities are everyplace, albeit quite variable and dependent on the context in which they "enter into language," become institutionalized, and are regulated. Geographers have been specifically insightful {{about the ways in which}} [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Although the {{liberalization}} <b>of</b> <b>sexuality</b> in American film had increased during the 1920s, the pre-Code era is either dated {{to the start}} of the sound film era, or more generally to March 1930, when the Hays Code was first written. Over the protests of NAMPI, New York became the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court's decision in Mutual Film vs. Ohio by instituting a censorship board in 1921. Virginia followed suit the next year, and eight individual states had a board by the advent of sound film.|$|E

5|$|Drugs, devices, surgery, {{and other}} {{interventions}} exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although male fertility is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. Women's fertility {{is not usually}} affected, although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about sexuality {{is an important part}} of SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development <b>of</b> <b>sexuality</b> and includes education for them and their families. Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. Body image and other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on self-esteem and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects <b>of</b> <b>sexuality,</b> which encompasses not just sexual practices but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.|$|E

5|$|The Petition {{caused a}} flurry of {{broadside}} satires, poems and ballads on the subject through the following year.

Two years after the riots, a mob gathered once more and again swore they would raze Cresswell's cathouse to the ground, though protection from the local beadles prevented the attack.|$|E

40|$|How can a rigid Gay Male {{identity}} {{cope with}} that really cute guy, {{who used to}} be a butch baby dyke, and is still involved in a primary relationship with a woman, but considers herself basically a gay man? [...] . As it's finally sinking in that if gender is fluid, how can sexual "orientation" not be as well? How can you be rigidly orientated toward something that is amorphous shifting, fluid, tricky, elusive? Basing your identity on sexuality is like building your house on a foundation of pudding" (Scott 1997 : 65 - 66) This short intervention seeks to challenge geographies <b>of</b> <b>sexualities</b> to further interrogate the possibilities and limitations of queer. Specifically it seeks to contend that geographies <b>of</b> <b>sexualities</b> should not be simplistically conflated with queer geographies. In exploring queer and its potentials beyond its deployment as an overarching term to describe multiple sexual dissidents (including lesbian, gay and bisexual) this intervention seeks to open up potentially productive avenues between geographies and queer theory. I engage with contemporary debates within queer studies and lesbian and gay studies as well as addressing the sub-discipline <b>of</b> geographies <b>of</b> <b>sexualities.</b> In emphasising fluidity and the slippages of queer, however, this piece does not offer clear answers or solutions. Instead, it seeks to open up potentialities of queer geographies and <b>of</b> geographies <b>of</b> <b>sexualities</b> beyond those offered by queer. The tensions between geographies <b>of</b> <b>sexualities</b> and queer geographies can offer ways of thinking through the problems of fluidity and naming, and the implications these questions have for political thought and action, beyond queer and sexualities, both within and outside of geography...|$|R

Many legends report various beings draining other fluids from victims, an unconscious association with semen being obvious.

5|$|As a {{reflection}} of categories <b>of</b> <b>sexuality</b> so sharply defined {{by the government and}} society at large, lesbian subculture developed extremely rigid gender roles between women, particularly among the working class in the U.S. and Canada. Although many municipalities had enacted laws against cross-dressing, some women would socialize in bars as butches: dressed in men's clothing and mirroring traditional masculine behavior. Others wore traditionally feminine clothing and assumed a more diminutive role as femmes. Butch and femme modes of socialization were so integral within lesbian bars that women who refused to choose between the two would be ignored, or at least unable to date anyone, and butch women becoming romantically involved with other butch women or femmes with other femmes was unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions <b>of</b> <b>sexuality</b> and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th century botany {{was one of}} the few {{sciences}} considered {{appropriate for}} genteel educated women. Around 1760, with the popularization of the Linnaean system, botany became much more widespread among educated women who painted plants, attended classes on plant classification, and collected herbarium specimens although emphasis was on the healing properties of plants rather than plant reproduction which had overtones <b>of</b> <b>sexuality.</b> Women began publishing on botanical topics and children's books on botany appeared by authors like Charlotte Turner Smith. Cultural authorities argued that education through botany created culturally and scientifically aware citizens, part of the thrust for 'improvement' that characterised the Enlightenment. However, in the early 19th century with the recognition of botany as an official science women were again excluded from the discipline.|$|E

40|$|Sport {{is often}} {{perceived}} as affected by heteronormativity; however, {{it also seems}} to facilitate the expression <b>of</b> nonconventional <b>sexualities.</b> In this article, the authors explore the narratives of 14 young Francophone sportswomen from Montreal (Quebec, Canada) who identify themselves as “gaie, ” “lesbian, ” “bisexual, ” or refuse labels alto-gether. A feminist poststructuralist approach is used to examine their discursive constructions <b>of</b> gender, <b>sexuality,</b> and sport. More specifically, the article aims to investigate the coming out process and the expression <b>of</b> nonconventional <b>sexualities</b> in sport. In line with queer theory, the findings challenge the heterosexual/homosexual binary, the idea <b>of</b> a fixed <b>sexuality,</b> and the linearity of the coming out process.

5|$|Historian Nancy Rabinowitz {{argues that}} ancient Greek red vase images portraying women {{with their arms}} around another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's {{shoulders}} can be construed as expressions of romantic desire. Much of {{the daily lives of}} women in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions <b>of</b> <b>sexuality.</b> Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.|$|E
