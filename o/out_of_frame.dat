25|$|In Manet’s painting, a barmaid gazes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame,</b> {{observed}} by a shadowy male figure. The whole scene {{appears to be}} reflected in the mirror behind the bar, creating a complex web of viewpoints. Wall borrows the internal structure of the painting, and motifs such as the light bulbs that give it spatial depth. The figures are similarly reflected in a mirror, and the woman has the absorbed gaze and posture of Manet’s barmaid, while the man is the artist himself. Though issues of the male gaze, particularly the power relationship between male artist and female model, and the viewer’s role as onlooker, are implicit in Manet’s painting, Wall updates the theme by positioning the camera at the centre of the work, so that it captures the act of making the image (the scene reflected in the mirror) and, at the same time, looks straight out at us.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} complex and {{relatively}} under-researched topic <b>of</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> session <b>frame</b> deviations. It considers the role <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> deviations in psychodynamic psychotherapy and the various conceptualisations <b>of</b> the <b>frame,</b> examining the debate between the ideas of a flexible and ‘elastic’ frame and a more unchanging and ‘impenetrable’ frame. The study uses a qualitative design to examine therapists’ understandings <b>of</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> session <b>frame</b> deviations as they have experienced them in practice. Six psychodynamic psychotherapists were interviewed and asked for their perceptions regarding <b>out</b> <b>of</b> session <b>frame</b> deviations. What emerged from {{the analysis of the}} interview material were diverse experiences of the types <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> deviations outside <b>of</b> the consulting room, by both therapist and patient. In addition, therapists felt that <b>out</b> <b>of</b> session <b>frame</b> deviations might {{have an impact on the}} therapeutic process, depending on their unconscious roots and on particular factors that were unique to the relationship. Therapists had strong countertransference reactions to <b>out</b> <b>of</b> session <b>frame</b> deviations and their handling of the deviations was often informed by these reactions. The handling <b>of</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> session <b>frame</b> deviations was also seen as specific to the relationship and, therefore, unique in each instance. Therapists’ perceptions of patient dynamics as they related to <b>out</b> <b>of</b> session <b>frame</b> deviations illustrated the varied functions that the deviations may serve and demonstrated that transference was sometimes prominent in the deviations. Therapists also emphasised the flexibility <b>of</b> the psychotherapy <b>frame</b> itself. The study illustrated that <b>out</b> <b>of</b> session <b>frame</b> deviations are important and relate significantly to the process of psychodynamic psychotherapy. They produce uncertainties and ambiguities for therapists in practice and should be examined closely rather than being overlooked...|$|R

25|$|The alley scene {{had to use}} a lot of computer-generated imagery to {{accomplish}} the look that the team needed. The entire alley had to be tracked by the computer in order {{to make sure that the}} digital raindrops hit all the objects in the frame, including dumpsters that were visible. In order to achieve the effect of time freezing around Lana just as she is about to get shot and fall to the ground, Kristin Kreuk had to lean against a structural support and hold her body still while filming. Beck and his team had to digitally remove the support from Kreuk, as well as the lower half of her body. They inserted a computer-generated lower half, as well as some hair trailing behind her in order to show that she was in the process of running when time stopped. As time returned to normal, what the audience sees is a completely computer-generated body fall <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame,</b> as only Lana’s lower half is in frame when time returns to normal.|$|E
500|$|Pantoliano {{returned}} to the set late in the second week to continue filming his scenes. On September 25, the crew shot the opening scene in which Leonard kills Teddy. Although the scene is in reverse motion, Nolan used forward-played sounds. For a shot of a shell casing flying upwards, the shell had to be dropped {{in front of the}} camera in forward motion, but it constantly rolled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame.</b> Nolan was forced to blow the casing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> instead, but in the confusion, the crew shot it backwards. They then had to make an optical (a copy of the shot) and reverse the shot to make it go forward again. [...] "That was the height of complexity in terms of the film", Nolan said. [...] "An optical to make a backwards running shot forwards, and the forwards shot is a simulation of a backwards shot." ...|$|E

500|$|Because of {{the hard}} work by Anthem, the {{producers}} made [...] "Kush" [...] and [...] "Requiem" [...] into bottle episodes, to give the visual effects team a break. Instead, other forms of special effects were used. To create the Himalayan feel of [...] "Kush", the production crew used wind machines and paper snow. However, the fake snow became {{a problem for the}} cast, as they suffered from bloodshot eyes and scratchy throats when exposed to it. Aquariums were placed outside each port hole of the set in [...] "Requiem". To complete the effects where Druitt teleports, Heyerdahl would walk out of the shot while every other cast member has to stay still, until the directors signal them to react; the shot of Heyerdahl walking <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> would later be cut. Another effect involving Heyerdahl is a scene between both his characters, Bigfoot and Druitt, in [...] "Revelations". To complete the shot, Heyerdahl had to film two different shots: one with him as Druitt talking to nothing, and another with him as Bigfoot talking to nothing. When both characters can be seen walking together, a stand-in would replace Heyerdahl as Bigfoot.|$|E
500|$|Director Jeunet {{wanted to}} display Ripley's new powers, {{including}} {{a scene in}} which Ripley throws a basketball through a hoop while facing the opposite direction. Weaver trained for ten days and averaged one out of six baskets, although the distance required for filming was farther than she had practiced. Jeunet was concerned about the time being spent on the shot and wanted to either use a machine to throw the ball or to insert it later using computer-generated imagery (CGI). Weaver, however, was determined to make the shot authentic, and insisted on doing it herself. The shot required many dozens of takes, during which none of the balls went in. The crew were going to give up, but gave Weaver one last shot, and in this take, she got the ball in perfectly; the idea that she did it in one take is a myth. The ball was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> for a moment during the shot, and Pitof offered to edit it so that the ball was on-screen for the entire scene, but Weaver refused. Ron Perlman broke character when she made the basket, and turned to the camera to say [...] "Oh my god!" [...] There was enough of a pause between Weaver's basket and Perlman's statement for the film's editors to cut the scene accordingly during post-production.|$|E
500|$|Concerning inspirations on the season, Loeb {{revealed}} that [...] "Chinatown... {{is one of}} the things that influenced Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos when they created the character. So those kind of beautiful, long, wide expansive shots, where people sort of come into frame and go back <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> and someone’s in the foreground and then someone is way in the background and they’re having a conversation, that’s the stuff that makes it interesting." [...] Director of Photography Manuel Billeter and episodic director S. J. Clarkson took inspiration from the comics in terms of their color palette, while looking to the works of Wong Kar-wai as reference to create [...] "unconventional" [...] compositions, with Billeter explaining, [...] "There were a lot of foreground elements [...] headroom as well, and we never wanted to show an open frame. We wanted to create a sense of claustrophobia." [...] Billeter shot the season with a Red Epic Dragon camera in 4K resolution, with 5K used for some visual effects shots, and with Panavision PVintage lenses; he focused mostly on static frames and [...] "good composition", but did occasionally employ a camera dolly or steadicam. For lighting, Billeter noted that many New York street lamps had been changed from sodium-vapor lamps to LEDs, so he tried to recreate the [...] "warm, dirty color of sodium vapor" [...] for night exterior scenes.|$|E

500|$|In {{the short}} term, the {{introduction}} of live sound recording caused major difficulties in production. Cameras were noisy, so a soundproofed cabinet was used {{in many of the}} earliest talkies to isolate the loud equipment from the actors, at the expense of a drastic reduction in the ability to move the camera. For a time, multiple-camera shooting was used to compensate for the loss of mobility and innovative studio technicians could often find ways to liberate the camera for particular shots. The necessity of staying within range of still microphones meant that actors also often had to limit their movements unnaturally. Show Girl in Hollywood (1930), from First National Pictures (which Warner Bros. had taken control of thanks to its profitable adventure into sound), gives a behind-the-scenes {{look at some of the}} techniques involved in shooting early talkies. Several of the fundamental problems caused by the transition to sound were soon solved with new camera casings, known as [...] "blimps", designed to suppress noise and boom microphones that could be held just <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> and moved with the actors. In 1931, a major improvement in playback fidelity was introduced: three-way speaker systems in which sound was separated into low, medium, and high frequencies and sent respectively to a large bass [...] "woofer", a midrange driver, and a treble [...] "tweeter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buñuel {{preferred}} {{scenes that}} could simply be pieced together end-to-end in the editing room, resulting in long, mobile, wide shots which followed {{the action of}} the scene. [...] Filmmaker Patricia Gruben has attributed this procedure to a long-standing strategy on Buñuel's part intended to thwart external interference: [...] "he would make the whole scene in long four-minute dolly shots so the producers couldn't cut it". [...] Examples are especially present in his French films. For example, at the ski resort's restaurant in Belle de jour, Séverin, Pierre, and Henri converse at a table. Buñuel cuts away from their conversation to two young women, who walk down a few steps and proceed through the restaurant, passing behind Séverin, Pierre, and Henri, at which point the camera stops and the young women walk <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame.</b> Henri then comments on the women and the conversation at the table progresses from there.|$|E

Another couple, Davidson and Isabelle, arrive. By the way that Marie, her boyfriend, and later the character Ivitch address Davidson, it appears {{that he is a}} professor. Brandishing a copy of The Gulag Archipelago, Davidson remarks that its author, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, did not need to use Google to search for the book's subtitle. The professor then asks Isabelle what thumbs used to be for before smartphones, making a punning reference to the French children's story Hop-o'-My-Thumb. He then proceeds to deliver an impromptu lecture on the ideas of Jacques Ellul, such as the abdication of individual rights and responsibilities to the state, a situation that Ellul declared to be the triumph of Adolf Hitler. Abruptly a car drives up, a man gets out and, speaking in German, he accosts Josette, who has been standing nearby. After demanding that she come home (implying that the man is Josette's husband), threatening her with consequences, and trying to physically drag her away, the man retreats <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> and fires shots from a gun. As the other characters rush to where the shots were fired, the car departs. Josette wanders away, while Gédéon, who has been watching all along, follows her.

2500|$|While {{considered}} simple by today's standards, the [...] "flying" [...] {{effects on}} Adventures of Superman were advanced for the period, although during season one {{it was apparent}} that, for distance flight shots, Superman was lying on a flat surface, his torso and thighs noticeably flattened between elbows and knees. Beginning with season two, Superman's [...] "flying" [...] involved three phases: take-off, flight, and landing. Cables and wires were used for Superman’s take-offs early in filming. In early episodes, stuntmen sometimes replaced Reeves for Superman’s wire-assisted take-offs. When Reeves came close to suffering a concussion in the episode [...] "Ghost Wolf" [...] (the supporting wires snapped and he fell to the studio floor), cables and wires were discarded and a springboard was brought in, designed by Thol [...] "Si" [...] Simonson, who remained with the series until its end. Reeves would run into frame and hit the out-of-frame springboard, which would boost him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> (sometimes over the camera) and onto padding. The springboard had enough force, along with subtle camera manipulation, {{to make it look}} as though he was actually taking off. The flying scenes were accomplished through a relatively few number of repeated shots. The typical technique had footage of Reeves stretched out on a spatula-like device formed to his torso and leg, operated on a counterweight like a boom microphone, allowing him to bank as if in flight. In a couple of later episodes, such as [...] "The Atomic Secret", Reeves simulated flying, opting to lie on the device without the molded form to support his legs, which are seen to hang from the waist in those episodes in marked contrast to the stock footage of Superman in flight.|$|E
