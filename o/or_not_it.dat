5|$|HIP 78530 b is {{most likely}} a brown dwarf, a massive object that {{is large enough to}} fuse {{deuterium}} (something that planets are too small to do) but not large enough to ignite and become a star. Because HIP 78530 b's characteristics blend the line between whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>it</b> is a brown dwarf or a planet, astronomers have tried to determine what HIP 78530 b is by predicting whether it was created in a planet-like or star-like (how brown dwarves are formed) manner.|$|E
5|$|RNA viruses: Replication {{usually takes}} place in the cytoplasm. RNA viruses can be placed into four {{different}} groups depending on their modes of replication. The polarity (whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>it</b> can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own RNA replicase enzymes to create copies of their genomes.|$|E

5|$|Set during autumn, Through the Looking-Glass {{begins with}} Alice indoors as she {{plays with the}} kittens of her pet cat, Dinah. Through a mirror, she travels to the {{alternative}} world behind the mirror, where chess pieces are alive. Encountering various characters, she eventually becomes a queen, and attends a party celebrating her coronation, although it quickly grows chaotic. Grabbing and shaking the Red Queen, Alice awakens back indoors, holding one of the kittens. The novel concludes with Alice's speculation on whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>it</b> was her dream or the Red King's.|$|E
5|$|Some {{historians have}} {{suggested}} that the Games were alluded to in playwright William Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, and used that as evidence to suggest that Shakespeare may have seen the Games. But the allusion is not present in the quarto edition of 1602, making its first appearance in the posthumous First Folio of 1623, edited by Henry Condell and John Hemminges. It is therefore uncertain whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>it</b> was written by Shakespeare.|$|E

5|$|Two {{varieties}} {{have been}} described. Chalciporus piperatus var. hypochryseus was originally described as Boletus hypochryseus by Czech mycologist Josef Šutara in 1993, and {{was moved to}} Chalciporus a year later by Regis Courtecuisse. Wolfgang Klofac and Irmgard Krisai-Greilhuber reclassified it as a variety of C.piperatus in 2006, although some sources continue to regard it as a distinct species. Variety amarellus, first published by Quélet as Boletus amarellus in 1883 and later transferred to Chalciporus by Bataille in 1908, {{was described as a}} variety of C.piperatus in 1974 by Albert Pilát and Aurel Dermek. Authorities disagree as to whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>it</b> has independent taxonomic significance.|$|E
5|$|We {{were trying}} to avoid that whole game of who gets in first with the reviews.

5|$|Whether {{the above}} details are {{accurate}} <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>it</b> {{is clear that}} Svein, Olaf the Swede and Eirik had ample reason to oppose Olaf Tryggvason. Olaf had taken control of Viken in south Norway, an area long under Danish overlordship. Olaf and Svein had been in England together, but Olaf had made peace while Svein kept campaigning. Svein was on friendly terms with Olaf the Swede and connected to him by marriage, so the two were natural allies. Finally, Jarl Eirik had been driven from his patrimony by Olaf Tryggvason, as arguably had his father, Jarl Hakon, whom he may have wished to avenge.|$|E

5|$|After the fight, the Fitzgeralds kept up {{appearances}} {{with their}} friends, seeming happy. In September, Zelda overdosed on sleeping pills. The couple never {{spoke of the}} incident, and refused to discuss whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>it</b> was a suicide attempt. Scott returned to writing, finishing The Great Gatsby in October. They attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both were unhappy and unhealthy. When he received the proofs from his novel he fretted over the title: Trimalchio in West Egg, just Trimalchio or Gatsby, Gold-hatted Gatsby, or The High-bouncing Lover. It was Zelda who preferred The Great Gatsby. It was also on this trip, while ill with colitis, that Zelda began painting.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury the {{bimetallic}} relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. It is a matter of debate as whether he intended to do this <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> <b>It</b> has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.|$|E
5|$|As {{attorney}} general, Crittenden issued {{only one}} notable opinion. The plaintiff {{in the case}} was an individual whose property had been damaged during Andrew Jackson's invasion of {{what would become the}} Florida Territory in 1818. The case was still being adjudicated in 1841. A Florida court found in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the federal government to compensate him for the damages and to pay him interest on his claim from the time the damages were incurred. Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing asked Crittenden whether the court had the authority to award interest and whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>it</b> should be paid. Crittenden opined that it did not, and Ewing did not pay the interest. Crittenden's opinion was used as a precedent in similar cases by future attorneys general.|$|E

5|$|In 1941, with World War II {{raging in}} Europe but the United States not yet at war, Feynman {{spent the summer}} working on {{ballistics}} problems at the Frankford Arsenal in Pennsylvania. After the attack on Pearl Harbor had brought the United States into the war, Feynman was recruited by Robert R. Wilson, who was working on means to produce enriched uranium for use in an atomic bomb, as part of {{what would become the}} Manhattan Project. Wilson's team at Princeton was working on a device called an isotron, which would electromagnetically separate uranium-235 from uranium-238. This was done in a quite different manner from that used by the calutron that was under development by a team under Wilson's former mentor, Ernest O. Lawrence, at the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California. On paper, the isotron was many times more efficient than the calutron, but Feynman and Paul Olum struggled to determine whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>it</b> was practical. Ultimately, on Lawrence's recommendation, the isotron project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Miralles {{and others}} {{reviewed}} the taxon maculata {{and concluded that}} the animal now known as Trachylepis maculata also belongs in the African clade, but they were unable to determine whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>it</b> is indigenous to Guyana. They also reviewed Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata and replaced it with Trachylepis tschudii because the older name was preoccupied by Linnaeus's and Gray's punctata. Although they were unable to resolve the identity of T.tschudii, which is still known from a single specimen, they believed that it is most likely the same species as the Noronha skink; it may be either a representative of an undiscovered Amazonian population of the latter or simply a mislabeled animal from Fernando de Noronha.|$|E
5|$|Israeli Arab {{historian}} Mustafa Kabha {{wrote that}} Egyptian and other Arab historians did not attribute as much {{importance to the}} battle as Israeli ones. They ask what the Egyptian objective was, and whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>it</b> was wise to advance without securing their lines of communication. Abdullah el Tell, commander of the Jordanian Legion in Jerusalem, thought that the Egyptians did not consider the Legion's needs. Aware of their weaknesses, they did not let anything distract them from reaching Tel Aviv. The Egyptian war log, from 19:00 on May 28, 1948, showed concern over the lines of communication. Muhammad Nimr al-Hawari wrote that while the Egyptians publicly declared that the target was Tel Aviv, they never actually meant to advance farther than their Isdud fortifications. As evidence, he cited the Egyptian refusal to take the undefended Yibna despite the villagers' repeated cries for help. Bahjat Abu-Gharbiyeh, one of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni's deputies and commander of the Beit Jibrin area, wrote that the Egyptians never had a clear plan, because their leadership were not really interested in a war. Therefore, their efforts were improvised. Kabha concludes that Arab historiography considers the battle the successful realization of a tactical move, designed to serve {{the actions of the}} badly coordinated Arab armies.|$|E
