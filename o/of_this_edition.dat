5|$|The rest <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> I {{have not}} read, but, {{from the little}} that I have seen, I think it not {{dangerous}} to declare that, in my opinion, its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy.

5|$|After the 1976 Gulf Cup of Nations the {{managerial}} staff was changed and the Iraq Football Association assigned the Croatian manager, Lenko Grčić, {{as the new}} manager of the Iraq national football team, Saeed was called up to the national team, {{for the first time}} in his career, at the age of 18. He made his debut on 5 September 1976 in a friendly match against Saudi Arabia where they drew 0–0. He continued to play in the youth team because the manager, Miodgard Stankovic, was Yugoslavian, reaching an understanding with Grčić. Iraq achieved the 1977 AFC Youth Championship where Saeed scored the winning goal in the final, from a diving header in the 90th minute, against Iran in a 4–3 victory in Tehran. Saeed was also the top goalscorer <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> with 9 goals, scoring his first national hat-trick against Afghanistan in Iraq's 5–1 win. The same team represented Iraq in the first edition of the FIFA World Youth Championship in 1977 where they lost 3–1 to the Soviet Union, won 5–1 over Austria with Saeed scoring a hat-trick, and lost 4–0 to Paraguay which knocked them out of the competition.|$|E

25|$|The Sistine Vulgate {{prepared}} by Pope Sixtus V was edited in 1590 {{but it was}} unsatisfactory from a textual point of view. As a result this edition was short-lived. Clement VIII (1592–1605) ordered Franciscus Toletus, Augustinus Valerius, Fredericus Borromaeus, Robertus Bellarmino, Antonius Agellius, and Petrus Morinus to make corrections and to prepare a revision. The revision {{was based on the}} Hentenian edition. It was printed on 9 November 1592, with a preface written by Cardinal Bellarmine. The misprints <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> were partly eliminated in a second (1593) and a third (1598) edition.|$|E
25|$|This was {{necessary}} {{because when the}} first copies <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> arrived {{in the country at}} the end of 1870, President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's opposition took advantage of the modifications in the legal code sanctioned by Congress to initiate a media campaign against the government. For this reason Victorino de la Plaza and Aurelio Prado were appointed to compare both versions and report on the existing differences. While they were doing so, on January 1, 1871 President Sarmiento's decree declared the Buenos Aires edition to be official.|$|E
