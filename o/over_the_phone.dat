5|$|American actress Christina Ricci guest {{starred in}} the episode as Erin, one of Lisa's new friends. Ricci {{was not able to}} come to the {{recording}} studio, so she recorded all of her lines <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> Weinstein, who was a fan of Ricci, thought she did a nice performance in the episode.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer John Toll {{began talking}} to Malick in August 1996 several times <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> about the film. Toll met Malick in September {{of the same}} year and was asked to do the film in the {{beginning}} of 1997. Malick and Toll began location scouting in February 1997 and started principal photography in June of that year.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} twentieth century psychics were {{commonly}} associated with New Age culture. Psychic readings and advertising for psychics were very common from the 1960s on, as readings were offered for a fee and given in settings such as <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phones,</b> in a home, or at psychic fairs.|$|R
50|$|The N93 {{improved}} upon camera capabilities <b>over</b> <b>the</b> N90. <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> has a 3.2-megapixel camera, Carl Zeiss optics and 3x optical zoom (<b>the</b> first Nokia <b>phone</b> to have it) {{as well as}} a 30 fps 640×480 (VGA) MPEG-4 {{video recording}} capability.|$|R
50|$|Sagem phones {{have always}} been plagued by {{aesthetic}} wear problems. This {{is especially true of}} the myX-7 model, where the screen is known to scuff and crack particularly easily. <b>The</b> <b>phone's</b> electronics are for the most part able to withstand most normal wear, due to the fact they are not packed tightly into a small space (thus causing components to bump each other), but rather are spread out <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone's</b> surface area.|$|R
5|$|The Record of the Year was {{an award}} voted by the UK public. The award began in 1998, and was {{televised}} on ITV before being dropped in 2006 after disagreements <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> voting element. Since {{then it has}} been an online poll, administered through the Record of the Year website. In 2013, the award came to an end. Mars was nominated twice.|$|E

Black and Hollis arrive to find that Watts and Group members have trained a sniper upon the building; Watts speaks to Swan <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and agrees to release information confirming the Millennium Group's role in the biological tests. However, during this time, Taylor has freed herself and taken Swan's antidote; she ambushes him and breaks his neck. After she returns home, she asks her father if Swan was right about Group's involvement; he does not answer.|$|E
5|$|Desperate for {{something}} to put on, Leslie tells Mark that he should propose to Ann {{in front of the}} camera and he agrees. Not long after, however, Ann confides in Leslie that she wants to break up with Mark, citing that he is simply not the one.

5000|$|LifeProof {{combines}} many {{technologies to}} create a case that protects electronic devices from the inside out. The case will make <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> waterproof, dirtproof, snowproof, and shockproof. [...] LifeProof's case for Apple iPhones only adds 1/16 in {{to the sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> <b>The</b> case combines a polycarbonate frame, waterproof acoustic ports, a waterproof screen protector that is still fully touch sensitive, and a built-in optical glass that covers <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone's</b> camera lenses to prevent loss of photographic detail. Every LifeProof case is put together in a two-part snap-together assembly that has a thin polymer gasket where it closes. Each case then becomes fully waterproof after sealing, and also seals the charging port via a hinged, gasketed door.|$|R
5|$|Mahone obtains {{a picture}} of Wyatt and meets with his estranged wife Pam, who makes him promise to hunt down and kill Wyatt. When Wyatt is {{captured}} Mahone tortures him, forcing him to apologize to his wife <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> He ties a cinderblock to Wyatt's wrists, and drowns him in the ocean. The group manages to complete Scylla, and Lincoln absolves Mahone {{for his role in}} his father's death. Self betrays the team and steals Scylla, forcing them to be fugitives once again.|$|E
5|$|Remittances from Abroad: As {{identity}} theft happens {{in many different}} ways: a thief obtains credit card receipts or bank statements from your wallet or trash; personal information is inadvertently provided <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> or Internet; or other confidential information. Before a person even realizes their personal information has been compromised, their credit and goods is claimed by fraudulent persons. The use of the Lebanese Identity Card and PIN in claiming goods and monies sent from abroad {{has been designed to}} prevent unauthorized persons from claiming what is due to the Lebanese Identity Card holder.|$|E
5|$|That night, Scully {{talks to}} Mulder <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and informs him that Pudovkin is {{a con man}} {{and part of the}} Russian mafia. Frustrated by the conversation, Scully calls Jerse and tells him that she changed her mind. At a nearby lounge, Scully is {{concerned}} about Ed's arm, where he has burned the tattoo with a cigarette butt. Ed convinces Scully to get a tattoo, and she has one of an Ouroboros applied to her back. Scully stays at Ed's apartment. The tattoo is angry at him, saying she will be dead if he kisses her, which he does anyway.|$|E

5000|$|Malaysian diver Ooi Tze Liang, who was {{participating}} in the 2014 Singapore Fina Diving Grand Prix, reported paying over S$4,800 for two iPhone 6 phones, despite being quoted a price of $2,500. Ooi {{was unaware of the}} cost when he signed a contract for a warranty package amounting to over $2,300. Ooi said that the shopkeeper refused to hand <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> unless <b>the</b> payment was made. Ooi paid up instead of cancelling the warranty contract, which would have cost him $800. It was reported by The New Paper that there was [...] "little that can be done by the authorities" [...] as the customer signed a contract.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the “Android Drone” project {{was to create a}} quadcopter that can be {{controlled}} by user input sent <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone’s</b> Wi-Fi connection or 4 G internet connection. Furthermore, the purpose was also to be able to receive live video feedback <b>over</b> <b>the</b> internet connection, thus making the drone an inexpensive option compared to other, equivalent drones that might cost thousands of dollars. Not only that, but <b>the</b> Android <b>phone</b> also has a host of other useful features that could be utilized by the drone: this includes GPS, pathing, picture taking, data storage, networking and TCP/IP, a Java software environment, and a large, diverse variety of Android software endpoints that allow for things like facial recognition or motion detection. Ultimately, this project was intended to give a cost effective means of adding hundreds of potential features to a standard quadcopter...|$|R

5|$|The {{only major}} cup {{competition}} won by Bristol Rovers is the 1972 Watney Cup, when they beat Sheffield United in the final. The club {{also won the}} Division Three (South) Cup in 1934–35, as well as winning or sharing the Gloucestershire Cup on 32occasions. The team has never played in European competition; the closest Rovers came was when they missed out on reaching the international stage of the Anglo-Italian Cup in the 1992–93 season on a coin toss held <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> with West Ham United.|$|E
5|$|Although Platt desired a recess, Hanna refused, {{wanting the}} {{convention}} to complete its work that day, and the delegates proceeded {{to the presidential}} nomination. McKinley had insisted that Foraker nominate him to demonstrate {{the unity of the}} Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was waiting with family and friends at his house in Canton, being kept up to date by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception that met it, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> line. McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles.|$|E
50|$|Pulse-code {{modulation}} (or PCM) allows {{higher rate}} digital transmissions <b>over</b> <b>the</b> analog <b>phone</b> lines. PCM upstream provides a digital connection for upstream data, reducing latency and {{allowing for a}} maximum upload speed of 48 kbit/s. Previously the speed was limited to a 33.6 kbit/s analog signal under the previous V.90.|$|R
5000|$|Because <b>the</b> device {{communicates}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> cellular <b>phone</b> network, no [...] "reader" [...] {{is required}} at the weigh station {{to identify the}} vehicle. If the vehicle’s credentials, safety, and weight data are all in order, a green indicator on <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> or EOBR advises the driver to bypass the facility. If the vehicle is required to pull-in for inspection, a red indicator and audible alert advises the driver to stop for inspection, just as trucks without Drivewyze must do.|$|R

5|$|At soccer {{practice}} the next day, Brendon—still upset with his mother's decision to date his coach—is uncooperative and chastises McGuirk for dating his mother, {{accusing him of}} desires {{to engage in a}} relationship with all the soccer players' mothers. While being driven home by Erik, Brendon asks Erik to fight McGuirk as revenge, but Erik denies his request and suggests he take his mind off the topic by playing a car game. Eventually, Brendon decides to apologize to McGuirk for his behavior, and the two reconcile. Later, McGuirk and Paula decide <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to end their relationship, a decision Brendon overhears using three-way calling.|$|E
5|$|Communications {{with the}} outside world went through a single Forest Service line until April 1943, when it was {{replaced}} by five Army telephone lines. This was increased to eight in March 1945. There were also three teletypewriters with encoding machines. The first was installed in March 1943, and two more were added in May 1943. One was removed in November 1945. There were telephones in the offices, but none in private residences, as the Army regarded this as a security hazard. There were some public phones in the township for emergencies. Since {{there was no way to}} prevent the lines being tapped, classified information could not be discussed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> lines. Initially the phone lines were operable only during business hours until enough WACs arrived to man the switchboard around the clock.|$|E
5|$|During a New Year's Eve party, Harry and Sally find {{themselves}} attracted to each other. Though they remain friends, they set {{each other up}} with their respective best friends, Marie and Jess. When the four go to a restaurant, Marie and Jess become fast friends, and later become engaged. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> Sally tearfully tells Harry that her ex is getting married. He rushes to her apartment to comfort her, and they have sex; Harry leaves the next morning distressed. Their friendship cools until a heated argument at Jess and Marie's wedding dinner. Harry attempts to mend his friendship with Sally, but she feels that they cannot be friends.|$|E
30|$|So, {{here is the}} reality: The average Indian user did {{not spend}} the {{equivalent}} of even one-tenth of a U.S. $ per month on mobile apps by the year 2012 ! Commercial costs are too frightening to such users, and so most of them completely avoid Web access <b>over</b> <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone,</b> which is in principle so readily available.|$|R
50|$|Mobile top-up for prepaid mobile {{subscribers}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common mobile-related financial transactions. This is made considerably easier, if the payment for topping up the mobile account can also be made <b>over</b> <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone.</b> There are already many online recharge options available and emerging, which point to the rapid growth in this business segment.|$|R
50|$|The station used a {{broadcast}} system {{that allowed them}} to send images live <b>over</b> <b>the</b> cellular <b>phone</b> network, allowing them to go to places that traditional television network news journalists could not go with their satellite trucks. As well their images went out live, rather that delayed, and they offered an alternative perspective on the events.|$|R
5|$|In October 1995, Sirivudh {{talked about}} his desire to assassinate Hun Sen during an {{interview}} with So Naro, who was the secretary-general of the Khmer Journalists Association. A few days later Ung Phan, a FUNCINPEC minister who had close ties with Hun Sen, called Sirivudh and accused him of getting involved in receiving kickbacks for printing Cambodian passports. Sirivudh angrily denied the accusations and threatened to kill Hun Sen <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> The phone conversation was recorded, and Ung Phan passed the recorded phone conversation to CPP co-minister of the interior Sar Kheng. Hun Sen learnt of the conversation and became enraged at Sirivudh's comments, and pressured Ranariddh and other FUNCINPEC ministers to strip his parliamentary immunity {{so that he could}} be arrested. Sirivudh was arrested and briefly placed in detention, but subsequently exiled to France when Sihanouk intervened in the case.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Dan Greaney and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. The episode guest stars Christina Ricci, who recorded her lines <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> instead of going into the studio. The beach house the Simpson family stays in is based on then-show runner Josh Weinstein's parents' house in New Hampshire. The episode features cultural references to Pippi Longstocking, The New Yorker character Eustace Tilley, and Alice and The Hatter from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

40|$|Findings from an Australian {{case study}} of adult women expose general, light and basic use of mobile phones. Participants used their mobile phone mainly for {{coordination}} {{and to a lesser}} extent for practicing intrinsic interactions motivated by emotional support purposes. This paper focuses on social and emotional support <b>over</b> <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone.</b> Though crucial to individuals, emotional support seems to be a neglected area of research among mobile communication studies, all the more so when focusing on adult women. This study addresses this literature gap. The empirical findings are based on a {{case study of}} 26 women over 35 years of age residing in one coastal Australian town. The research design included a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. This paper examines the communication methods adult women use for social and emotional support, and analyses reasons and social implications of this limited intrinsic communication use pattern <b>over</b> <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Minnesotans United for All Families campaign became its huge grassroots effort to have conversations with the voters about marriage. Rather than focus on equal rights and fairness, as was done in previous campaigns, Minnesotans United and its thousands of volunteers, had personal conversations <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> and face to face about how marriage had the same importance and meaning for both straight and same-sex couples. This messaging strategy, which was also used in the campaign’s ad campaign, helped move conflicted voters and resulted in Minnesota being the first state, after 30 attempts, to defeat a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Minnesotans United is likely the biggest grassroots campaign in the state's history, having had 27,000 volunteers knock on over 400,000 doors and make over 900,000 <b>phone</b> calls in <b>the</b> final eight days of the campaign ...|$|R
