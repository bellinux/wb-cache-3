25|$|DHEA {{and other}} adrenal androgens such as androstenedione, {{although}} relatively weak androgens, {{are responsible for}} the androgenic effects of adrenarche, such as early pubic and axillary hair growth, adult-type body odor, increased <b>oiliness</b> of hair and skin, and mild acne.

25|$|Although {{progesterone}} {{does not}} bind {{directly to the}} AR, it is a precursor and intermediate in the biosynthesis of androgens from cholesterol. For this reason, {{there has been some}} speculation that exogenous progesterone could be transformed into androgens by certain tissues that express the requisite enzymes. Progesterone is converted by 17α-hydroxylase into 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is converted by 17,20-lyase into androstenedione, and androstenedione is converted by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases into testosterone. CYP17A1, the cytochrome P450 gene that encodes 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, is expressed mainly in the gonads (ovaries and testes) and the adrenal glands. Despite the reasoning that progesterone could be converted into androgens however, clinical studies in which women were treated with 100 to 300mg/day OMP have found no or only a small increase in levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and no change in androgen levels, including those of dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, and testosterone. In these studies, levels of estradiol and cortisol, which progesterone is also a precursor of, did not change either, although levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone did increase significantly. In accordance with the lack of changes in androgen levels, progesterone, unlike various progestins, has not been associated with androgenic effects in clinical studies, including changes in the blood lipid profile or sex hormone-binding globulin levels, acne, skin <b>oiliness,</b> hirsutism, or voice deepening, or induction of teratogenicity (i.e., virilization of female fetuses).|$|E

50|$|The {{principal}} physical {{consequences of}} adrenarche are androgen effects, especially pubic hair (in which Tanner stage 2 becomes Tanner stage 3) {{and the change}} of sweat composition that produces adult body odor. Increased <b>oiliness</b> of the skin and hair and mild acne may occur. In most boys, these changes are indistinguishable from early testicular testosterone effects occurring {{at the beginning of}} gonadal puberty. In girls, the adrenal androgens of adrenarche produce most of the early androgenic changes of puberty: pubic hair, body odor, skin <b>oiliness,</b> and acne. In most girls the early androgen effects coincide with, or are a few months following, the earliest estrogenic effects of gonadal puberty (breast development and growth acceleration). As female puberty progresses, the ovaries and peripheral tissues become more important sources of androgens.|$|E

Aside from the dramatic acting it requires, she has to endure that itchy, hot feeling while her face and body are heavily covered with dark make-up.

For babies who have died, the embalmer may apply a light cosmetic massage cream after embalming to provide a natural appearance; massage cream is also used on the face to prevent them from dehydrating, and the infant's mouth is often kept slightly open for a more natural expression. If possible, the funeral director uses a light, translucent cosmetic; sometimes, heavier, opaque cosmetics are used to hide bruises, cuts, or discolored areas. Makeup is applied to the lips to mimic their natural color. Sometimes a very pale or light pink lipstick is applied on males, while brighter colored lipstick is applied to females. Hair gels or baby oil is applied to style short hair; while hairspray is applied to style longer hair. Powders (especially baby powder) are applied to the body to eliminate odors, and it is also applied to the face to achieve a matte and fresh effect to prevent <b>oiliness</b> of the corpse. Mortuary cosmetizing is not done for the same reason as make-up for living people; rather, it is designed to add depth and dimension to a person's features that lack of blood circulation has removed. Warm areas - where blood vessels in living people are superficial, such as the cheeks, chin, and knuckles - have subtle reds added to recreate this effect, while browns are added to the palpabrae (eyelids) to add depth, especially important as viewing in a coffin creates an unusual perspective rarely seen in everyday life. During the viewing, pink-colored lighting is sometimes used near the body to lend a warmer tone to the deceased's complexion.|$|E
40|$|Keywords-Gray scale image, test image, {{weighted}} mean, <b>oiliness,</b> histogram Abstract. In {{medical examination}} of skin texture, an expert is generally needed {{to examine the}} skin texture thoroughly. It is felt that {{the same can be}} achieved through image processing, wherein a skin expert or physical presence of the patient are not needed on the spot. In the distant skin examination, expertise is required in analyzing the skin texture as appeared on the image. The texture is evaluated on the basis of <b>oiliness</b> of the skin, which is measured by a specific instrument [5]. As per our knowledge, the instrument is not readily available. To overcome this problem, a framework (SA-OILINESS) is proposed in this paper. It is designed so as to provide a scale to measure <b>oiliness</b> of facial skin through an image of a standard resolution. The proposed approach is based on the principle that the intensity of light from an oily skin is comparatively higher than that from a dry skin. Images of test subjects are taken {{at the same time and}} using the approach of weighted mean of the intensity of light reflected from the marked forehead region a scale of <b>oiliness</b> is developed. The scale is used to measure the relative value of <b>oiliness...</b>|$|E
40|$|The facial skin of many {{individuals}} is excessively oily in some areas, excessively dry in others. Skin care products for general use thus {{need to be}} compatible with both oily and dry skin. Formulating such compatible products requires accurate, objective assessment of <b>oiliness</b> and dryness in vivo. <b>Oiliness</b> is assessed by measuring skin surface friction; this characteristic varies on {{different parts of the}} face, and it may be altered by product application. The forehead and nasal fold areas were found to be oilier than the cheeks, and an inverse relationship was shown between perceived <b>oiliness</b> and skin surface friction. Drying effects are assessed by measuring the increased stiffness (tautness) of the stratum corneum which may result, for example, from ordinary washing with soap and water, or from application of products which have a drying effect on the skin. Changes in skin surface stiffness are more readily demonstrated on the cheeks than on the forehead, although baseline stiffness is found to be greater on this (latter) site. In this assessment, we use a gas-bearing electrodynamometer suitably adapted for measurements on the face. Objective measurements made with these instruments correlate well with self-assessment of facial <b>oiliness</b> and dryness...|$|E

There were founded a small-plot field trials at experimental stations in Žabčice and in Vatín during years 2014 and 2015. There were used the following variants: 1. unfertilized, 2. LAD + LAD, 3.

ENSIN was also added to LAD, when there was done regenerative fertilization with LAD and production fertilization with ENSIN, which comprised around 60 % of total dose of nitrogen. Total dose of nitrogen applied to the experimental plots was 194 kg. ha- 1. There was not proved any statistically significant effect of fertilizers with inhibitors on yield in Žabčice.
