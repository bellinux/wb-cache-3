40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to provide an {{overview}} of the development, concept and rules <b>of</b> the <b>exhaustion</b> doctrine on the international and EU level. The issue <b>of</b> the <b>exhaustion</b> doctrine and its application in a digital age became topical after the unexpected judgement of the CJEU in case UsedSoft v Oracle, in which was for the first time broken the conventional link between the exhaustion doctrine and the distribution of works in a tangible form. Although this decision has been widely criticized by legal experts, some thoughts of CJEU highlight imperfection of current legal regulation in a context of an internet age. The first chapter defines basic terms the intellectual property and the copyright including its historical evolution. The second chapter describes the origins <b>of</b> the <b>exhaustion</b> doctrine in the judicature of the national courts as a clue for balancing ownership and intellectual property rights. The extensive third chapter deals with formation <b>of</b> the <b>exhaustion</b> doctrine in judicature of the CJEU. Concrete cases are used to describe basic elements <b>of</b> the <b>exhaustion</b> doctrine. In the fourth chapter is a brief overview of the legal regulation concerning the <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> copyright on the international, EU and Czech level.

5|$|The Greek philosopher Zeno {{considered}} {{the problem of}} summing an infinite series to achieve a finite result, but rejected it as an impossibility: the result was Zeno's paradox. Later, Aristotle proposed a philosophical resolution of the paradox, but the mathematical content was apparently unresolved until taken up by Archimedes, {{as it had been}} prior to Aristotle by the Presocratic Atomist Democritus. It was through Archimedes's method <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> that an infinite number of progressive subdivisions could be performed to achieve a finite result.

Archimedes may have considered this method lacking in formal rigor, so he also used the method <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> to derive the results. As with The Cattle Problem, The Method of Mechanical Theorems was written {{in the form of a}} letter to Eratosthenes in Alexandria.|$|E

5|$|On February 8, 1942, Minister of Armaments Fritz Todt {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} shortly after taking off from Hitler's eastern {{headquarters}} at Rastenburg. Speer, who had arrived in Rastenburg the previous evening, had accepted Todt's offer to fly with him to Berlin, but had canceled some hours before takeoff (Speer stated in his memoirs that the cancellation was because <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> from travel and a late-night meeting with Hitler). Later that day, Hitler appointed Speer as Todt's successor to all of his posts. In Inside the Third Reich, Speer recounts his meeting with Hitler and his reluctance to take ministerial office, saying that he only did so because Hitler commanded it. Speer also states that Hermann Göring raced to Hitler's headquarters on hearing of Todt's death, hoping to claim Todt's powers. Hitler instead presented Göring with the fait accompli of Speer's appointment.|$|E

5|$|The plant's initial {{response}} to contact with prey consists of thigmotropic (movement {{in response to}} touch) tentacle movement, with tentacles bending toward the prey {{and the center of}} the leaf to maximize contact. D. anglica is also capable of further movement, being able to bend the actual leaf blade around prey to further the digestion process. Tentacle movement can occur in a matter of minutes, whereas the leaf takes hours or days to bend. When something gets caught, the tentacles touching the prey exude additional mucilage to mire down the prey, which eventually dies <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> or is asphyxiated as the mucilage clogs its tracheae. Once the prey has been digested and the resulting nutrient solution has been absorbed by the plant, the leaf unfurls, leaving only the prey's exoskeleton behind.|$|E
