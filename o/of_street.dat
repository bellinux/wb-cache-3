40|$|Urban {{streets are}} hierarchically {{organized}} {{in the sense that}} a majority <b>of</b> <b>streets</b> are trivial, while a minority <b>of</b> <b>streets</b> is vital. This hierarchy can be simply, but elegantly, characterized by the 80 / 20 principle, i. e. 80 percent <b>of</b> <b>streets</b> are less connected (below the average), while 20 percent <b>of</b> <b>streets</b> are well connected (above the average); out of the 20 percent, there is 1 percent <b>of</b> <b>streets</b> that are extremely well connected. This paper, using a European city as an example, examined, at a much more detailed level, such street hierarchies from the perspective of geometric and topological properties. Based on an empirical study, we further proved a previous conjecture that a minority <b>of</b> <b>streets</b> accounts for a majority of traffic flow; more accurately, the 20 percent <b>of</b> top <b>streets</b> accommodate 80 percent of traffic flow (20 / 80), and the 1 percent <b>of</b> top <b>streets</b> account for more than 20 percent of traffic flow (1 / 20). Our study provides new evidence as to how a city is (self-) organized, contributing to the understanding of cities and their evolution using increasingly available mobility geographic information.

It is the lowest of the three divisions of the Lower Jurassic period and, as such, is also given the name Lower Lias. It consists of thin blue argillaceous, or clay-like, limestone.
