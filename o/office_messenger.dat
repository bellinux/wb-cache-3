He {{had some success}} as a painter of portraits and history paintings, and exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the National Academy of Design. While working at the Patent Office, in 1855, he drew an unauthorized copy of Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware in colored crayon {{on the wall of}} a basement room in the building. The <b>office</b> <b>messenger</b> saw it and was preparing to whitewash over it when one of Washington's superiors, William Langdon, praised it; soon the Commissioner of the Patent Office took note, and brought President Franklin Pierce and his Secretary of the Interior, Robert McClelland, to view the picture. So impressed were they that the president returned on the following day, bringing with him his wife and another lady. What became of the picture is unknown, although it was recorded as having been still in place as late as October 1856.|$|E
500|$|The McCuddens {{moved to}} Sheerness in 1909 and James {{transferred}} to the garrison school. He learned to shoot at the rifle range, box and was a reasonably intelligent student. His father's retirement soon placed a heavy strain on the family finances {{and as a consequence}} McCudden felt obliged to find a [...] job before he could enlist in 1915. He filled the time from the age of 14 to the age of enlistment by working as a Post <b>Office</b> <b>messenger</b> boy. It was at this time McCudden's interest in flying began. In nearby Leysdown, on the Isle of Sheppey, one of the first aviation centres was built. It was here John Moore-Brabazon became the first Englishman to fly. McCudden and his brothers often went to see the pioneer aviators gather. McCudden expressed a desire to become a pilot after spending hours watching these early flying machines.|$|E

60|$|There was {{his story}} of Talleyrand {{and the five}} oyster-shells, and there was his utterly absurd account of Napoleon's second visit to Ajaccio.

60|$|On {{the next}} morning Alaric and his new {{companion}} met each other at an early hour at the Paddington station. Neverbend was rather fussy with his dispatch-box, and a large official packet, which an <b>office</b> <b>messenger,</b> dashing up in, a cab, brought {{to him at the}} moment of his departure. Neverbend's enemies were wont to declare that a messenger, a cab, and a big packet always rushed up at the moment of his starting on any of his official trips. Then he had his ticket to get and his Times to buy, and he really had not leisure to do more than nod at Alaric till he had folded his rug around him, tried that the cushion was soft enough, and completed his arrangements for the journey.|$|E
60|$|In {{this way}} Mrs Protheroe made her apology for giving Miss Mackenzie her tea downstairs, {{in a little}} back parlour behind the kitchen.

He did not change his name, he simply dropped the surname. His full name was Gregory Hilliard Hartley. He had always intended, when he had made a position for himself, to recur to it; and, of course, it will be open to you to do so, also. But I know {{that it would have been}} his wish that you, like him, should not do so, unless you had made such a position for yourself that you would be a credit to it.|$|E
