5|$|A station {{here was}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> phase two {{expansion}} of the Fleet line (now Jubilee line). It had originally been planned in 1943, and was revived as a major transport plan in 1965. London Transport spent £10m (now £m) in 1972 safeguarding the route underneath Cannon Street and building reinforcements for laying a tube in the water-bearing ground around the station. The plan was abandoned in the early 1980s in favour of the current extension further south.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{dominates the}} {{northern}} shore, where many plots of land are still {{owned by the}} descendants of early settlers. The largely abandoned historical communities of Rosita and West Portland are also located in this area. To the west, the Odem Bay extension is formed, and is fed by Rincon Bayou and a large complex of marsh formed by the Nueces River delta. Just south of the mouth, are the remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> Nuecestown settlement, which is now included in the Corpus Christi city limits.|$|E

5|$|Proceeding {{down the}} Mediterranean coast, the crusaders {{encountered}} little resistance, as local rulers preferred {{to make peace}} with them and furnish them with supplies rather than fight, with a notable exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> siege of Arqa. On 7 June, the crusaders reached Jerusalem, which had been recaptured from the Seljuqs by the Fatimids only the year before.

5|$|Redevelopment is {{underway}} for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> industrial facilities, with the abandoned Oliver Corporation buildings {{being the most}} recent example of reclaimed property. The city also faced programs with large swaths of vacant housing after {{the decline of the}} manufacturing industry. In 2013, 1,347 homes were vacant or abandoned. However, the city created the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative in February 2013, which aimed to take care of 1,000 vacant or abandoned homes in 1,000 days, either through demolition, repairing, or some other satisfactory means. As of June 2015, 828 homes have been demolished, repaired, or handed off to partners.|$|E

5|$|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is {{a nearly}} {{complete}} rewrite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> novel Stephen Hero. Joyce attempted {{to burn the}} original manuscript {{in a fit of}} rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A Künstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are among}} the least studied of all lemurs, and {{little is known about}} them. Only the pale fork-marked lemur (P.pallescens) has been studied {{relatively}} well, primarily by Pierre Charles-Dominique, Jean-Jacques Petter, and Georges Pariente during two expeditions in the 1970s and a more extensive 1998 study in Kirindy Forest. Like the other cheirogaleids, these lemurs are nocturnal, sleeping in tree hollows (typically in large baobab trees) or abandoned nests built by giant mouse lemurs (Mirza coquereli) during the day. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> nests they sleep in are leaf-lined, and fresh leaves are often added when young are born. As many as 30sleeping sites may be used {{over the course of a}} year, each for a variable length of time.|$|E

5|$|Harrison Scott, {{a retired}} engineer, was {{traveling}} north on I-5 {{with his son}} in 1991, when his son speculated about the difficulty of driving over the first road through the rugged terrain. Having some extra time, and recalling a drive on the old road in 1955, they left the freeway and traveled along most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> section. Near SR138, Scott asked a county road crew which was resurfacing the road if it was still maintained by the county, and the crew replied that they didn't know who maintained it through the desert. It {{turned out that the}} county officially owned it but did not maintain it; Scott has since convinced the county and forest to exchange ownership with the Santa Anita Canyon Road, then a county road.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November, the 2/23rd {{reached the}} Song, {{fighting}} {{its way across}} and the next day, after sharp fighting amidst a renewed local counterattack by Japanese forces, Kuanko was taken. To the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> village, the Japanese were positioned in strength and they launched a strong counterattack, which retook the vital high ground for them but was checked from progressing further by a heavy Australian artillery bombardment. At this stage, the 2/24th Infantry Battalion was released from its portage task and it was sent west to conduct a flanking movement around the Japanese position, cutting the Kuanko–Wareo track and capturing Kwatingkoo and Peak Hill early on 7 December, following a Japanese withdrawal. From there, {{it was a short}} march on to Wareo, which the Australians secured early the next day.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} dissertation {{explores the}} experience and representations of child abandonment in urban Johannesburg, South Africa. I examine this complex social behaviour {{through a number of}} perspectives specifically: how it is portrayed in the media; how it is represented and managed by child protection officers; <b>the</b> lived experience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abandoning</b> mother and <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> child; and finally how it is understood in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> Western biomedical principles and those of indigenous African ancestral beliefs. I suggest that child abandonment has been individualised and medicalised in South Africa. Individualised, in that it has been termed a problem that falls entirely within <b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> poor women, and frequently that these women are young teenagers. Medicalised in that a social behaviour that is not new, is increasingly being defined in medical terms through the portrayal and labelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abandoning</b> mother as emotionally unstable and criminally insane. I argue that this has been done in an attempt to motivate for stricter surveillance and control over women’s sexual reproductive health and to divert attention from the state’s role in addressing this growing social challenge...|$|R
5|$|Since the {{abolition}} of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt {{the decline of the}} building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant {{in the development of a}} conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.|$|E
5|$|The first chorus has Koda {{walking through}} the land, and scenes of her singing. She grabs a compass, {{but it does not}} {{function}} properly.

As she sings the song; {{by the end of the}} second chorus, black projectile smoke is scene falling from the sky in the distance and hits parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> city. As more smoke falls and black leaves con-stellate, Koda collapses and sings the bridge on the ground. When the bridge section ends, rocks start levitating and the smoke rises, forming a black Dust devil in the distance. As more dust devil's form, they become large and closely devour Koda.|$|E

5|$|Another {{reason for}} the gradual decline in the {{development}} of Sicily's Baroque and building in general was that the money was running out. During the 17th century, the aristocracy had lived principally on their landed estates, tending and improving them, and as a result their income also increased. During the 18th century, the nobility gradually migrated towards the cities, in particular Palermo, to enjoy the social delights of the Viceroy's court and Catania. Their town palazzi grew in size and splendour, to the detriment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> estates, which were still expected to provide the revenue. The land agents left to run the estates over time became less efficient, or corrupt, often both. Consequently, aristocratic incomes fell. The aristocracy borrowed money using the estates as surety, until the value of the neglected estates fell below the money borrowed against them. Moreover, Sicily was by now as unstable politically as its nobility were financially. Ruled from Naples by the weak Ferdinand IV and his dominant wife, Sicily had declined to {{the point of no return}} long before 1798 and again in 1806 when the King was forced by the invading French to flee Naples to Sicily. The French were kept at bay from Sicily only by an expeditionary force of 17,000 British troops, and Sicily was now ruled by Britain in effect if not in name. King Ferdinand then in 1811 imposed the first taxes, at a single stroke alienating his aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|The Sideling Hill Tunnel's {{original}} plans {{date back}} to the year 1881, when surveying for the South Pennsylvania Railroad began. Construction began that year, with the plans for nine brand-new tunnels, most of which were drilled by 1885. The Sideling Hill Tunnel was built before December 1884 by John O'Brien, an engineer from Rhinebeck, New York. On July 6, 1885, a blast occurred {{at the end of the}} Sideling Hill Tunnel. The blast, which was caused by dynamite, claimed the lives of three people, including O'Brien. Several other people were injured in the blast. Just sixteen days later, another blast occurred in the tunnel, taking the lives of a Hungarian worker, along with two African-Americans, two Italians, and one Irishman. The bodies were so cut by the rocks during the blast, that the people were almost unidentifiable. Unfortunately William H. Vanderbilt, who had started the plans for the railroad, noticed that expenses began to inflate, and he began to look for a second way to work things out. The construction was abandoned and never finished. In 1938, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission took over the entire grade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> railway.|$|E
