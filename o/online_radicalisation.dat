Thesis analyses sixteen issues of digital magazine Inspire published since 2010 by Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen called AQAP - Al Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula. Terrorist attacks by so called lone-wolfs on the territory of western states have had increasing tendency in the last decade. The phenomenon of <b>online</b> propaganda and <b>radicalisation</b> through social networks is progressively becoming one of the major challenges for western security services. Grasping the sociological and psychological aspects of lone wolfs' drivers for conducting terrorist attacks is thus crucial. The underpinning theory of the thesis is framing analysis together with the concept of delegitimization. Thesis traces the production and use of five framing tools - metaphor, catchphrases, depiction, exemplars and visual images (which are the combination of studies done by Fairhurst & Sarr and Gamson & Modigliani 1989).

40|$|The {{threat of}} Islamic {{terrorism}} {{has become the}} biggest threat to Australian National Security. Since 9 / 11 and the subsequent war on terror, the threat of terrorism has not subsided. Significant parts of this threat are the <b>online</b> discourses of <b>radicalisation</b> perpetuated throughout social media. Literature reviewed included main discursive influences {{as well as a number}} of useful theoretical frameworks for later analysis. This thesis used a longitudinal online ethnographic approach coupled with Grounded Theory to examine the discourses and processes involved in radicalisation. The global context for this study was significant and hence has been outlined. Three overarching meta narratives were found: Narratives of grievance, narratives of jihad and narratives of martyrdom. Another important finding was that these narratives were complemented by a significant number of visual images that embedded and conveyed slightly different, yet complementary discourses. In addition, several case studies were also undertaken looking at the discourses and process of recruitment. A case study on the researcher’s insights was also included covering recruiting strategies of the newly formed Islamic State terrorist group. A number of analytical frameworks were applied to the data with the most notable being the Psychiatric Power and the notion of an online institution in which power structures are embedded. A number of radicalisation models are examined in relation to the data and a new model is developed termed: Institutionalised Moral Reframing, which is built on the foundational notions of Psychiatric Power. Finally, implications for counter radicalisation policies are discussed with the need to broaden the focus to better deal with the threats posed by online social media...|$|R
40|$|More than {{a decade}} of security-based {{transnational}} approaches to combating terrorist activity and propaganda have demonstrated that these alone are ineffective. Sometimes, security measures can actually damage efforts to roll back the appeal and take-up of violent extremism. While such measures should be used in domestic contexts where threats are critical or imminent, failure to accompany these with robust “soft power” initiatives will prove fatal in the longer-term. Business as usual is not an option. Here is what needs to change if we are to succeed in countering violent extremism. 1. Rethink current approaches to creating a counter-narrative Counter-narrative remains a key strategy in the struggle to diminish violent extremism’s appeal, especially for young people. Governments around the world have been slow to respond to community needs and desires regarding this. Most governments now accept that credible counter-narratives must be community- rather than government-generated. Yet many agencies have remained ambivalent about forming genuine partnerships with community organisations that can develop authentic counter-narratives to reach and, more importantly, influence those at risk. Communities have tuned out to the “negative case” made by standard counter-narratives. They are seeking more “affirmative” narratives that offer genuine alternatives to hatred, enmity and terror. Greater effort is needed to promote social inclusion and community belonging for those who feel marginalised and disempowered. This involves focusing on what binds us together rather than on what divides us. An inclusive narrative must acknowledge the social and political idealism that makes some young people vulnerable to dimensions of terrorist messaging that promise a new or better world. We must offer genuine alternative forms of social activism and transformation, which explicitly reject violence while seeking change. 2. Follow the lead of Germany and Denmark in rehabilitating returned fighters Counter-narratives are not just about what we say but also what we do. This includes how we treat those returning from foreign conflicts. While it is clear that some foreign fighters return home hardened and committed to violent extremism, others do not. They find themselves disillusioned by the gap between the propaganda and the reality of foreign conflict. Rehabilitation for this latter group is essential. The Hayat program in Germany and the Aarhus program in Denmark are good examples of how to bypass over-securitisation of returned fighters and instead offer counselling, support and rehabilitation. These programs acknowledge the different reasons people participate in foreign conflicts. These reasons include idealism, humanitarianism and peer pressure, as well as a commitment to violent extremism as an ideology. A key benefit of rehabilitating returnees is that they have greater credibility with potential recruits and can positively influence them. Embracing those who respond to rehabilitation demonstrates the principles of a supportive society. That in itself is a powerful message to undermine the narrative of alienation, isolation and rejection that terrorist recruiters promote. 3. Assertively challenge media’s role in fostering disunity and xenophobia Some media reporting can severely undermine the crucial message of social inclusion by amplifying xenophobia, eroding trust and promoting social disharmony. The more coverage of terrorist-related issues demonises Muslim communities at large, the more entrenched a victim mentality can become for those targeted by sensationalised coverage. The sense of being “under siege” by media is experienced by the vast majority of peaceful Muslims around the world. This produces frustration, humiliation and fear for these communities and can actually increase radicalisation leading to violent extremism. Such coverage also encourages attacks on ordinary Muslims in diaspora communities because it appears to legitimise such actions. Those who experience such targeting become more mistrustful of the democracies in which they live. This makes them less likely to co-operate with authorities, even when they have important information or views to share. The “us and them” narratives of much media reporting need to be confronted assertively, by governments as much as by communities. 4. Demystify the ‘special nature’ of violent extremism Part of the appeal of violent extremism is that it seems to transcend ordinary criminal violence. It is characterised as a higher form of social action, in which forms of social, religious and ideological power and aspiration combine to reach beyond the ordinary and everyday. An effective way to diminish the appeal of violent extremism is to demonstrate that it is no different from other, more mundane violence. Stripped of its romanticised trappings as a higher calling, violent extremism should be treated as part of a broad-spectrum campaign against violence of all kinds. This approach exposes the ordinariness of violence, its consequences and its failure to achieve the promise of social change that lures many young people. 5. Use social media more often, more strategically and more creatively Social media outlets have been exploited by those promoting <b>online</b> dimensions of <b>radicalisation</b> and violent extremism. Sustained effort to challenge extremist messaging and representation through social media has been lacking, yet examples of effective strategies do exist. Programs such as All Together Now in Australia and Exit in Europe are leading the way in helping disengage those on pathways to extremism through social media. While in democratic countries censorship of social media remains untenable for excellent reasons, much more could be done, more nimbly and more creatively, to use social media as a counter-strategy. If, as some leading research has argued, terrorism is a communicative act, then we need to invest seriously in challenging and disrupting its messaging using the same communication channels and strategies. A key element here is embracing multimodal communication platforms that combine image, text and sound to reach people {{in the same way that}} sophisticated violent extremist propaganda routinely achieves. 6. Develop cognitive and emotional skills to deconstruct extremist ideology Education is a key to disrupting and dismantling terrorist ideology. In an age awash with information, media and diverse forms of knowledge, many young people struggle with the critical skills required to sift, sort and evaluate it all. These cognitive and emotional skills need to be comprehensively embedded in the curricula of schools and universities. The goal must be to equip young people to evaluate and argue against the interpretations of religion, history, politics and identity that are the bread and butter of terrorist recruitment narratives. Nor should we stop at the cognitive domain in thinking about how best to skill up our youth to critique and reject violent extremist ideology. Terrorist messaging does not just target the head. It focuses in increasingly sophisticated ways on the heart through visual and aural communication. Understanding the nexus between cognition and emotion, and developing in young people the understanding and ability to step back and analyse before acting, should be a primary focus of any counter-terrorism strategy. 7. Understanding the ‘supply chain’ means targeting recruiters Recruiters are the middle-men and women in the supply chain of violent extremism. Counter-terrorism strategies have tended to focus on grassroots initiatives to prevent the take-up of violent extremism at community level, while “disrupt and degrade” efforts have concentrated on the leadership of terrorist groups. Focusing on remote figureheads may help score largely symbolic goals for governments and task-forces. But the middle-men and women, as always, are the linchpin. Without them the leaders cannot marshal the human resources to execute their strategies. Targeting recruiters should not just be about removing them from circulation – as a securitisation model would propose. It should also aim to undermine their influence with alternatives that speak to the deeper needs and desires of those susceptible to their influence. It is vital to work with communities to identify, understand the strategies of and disempower locally influential recruiters in order to nullify their messages and reduce their reach and appeal. 8. Women are emerging as key players in violent extremism Programs to counter violent extremism tend to focus on alienated, angry young men and the ways that certain constructs of masculinity and violence may be linked. But the complexities of contemporary violent extremism have increasingly seen women emerge as influential players – as spokespeople, recruiters, enablers and in some instances as fighters. While female fighters and violent extremists are hardly new, complex issues involving power, disenfranchisement and agency for women are making themselves felt in new ways. Strategies relying on the assumption that women are generally key influencers away from violent extremism need to be rethought. While this may be true in some instances, the increased involvement of women in terrorist propaganda and social influence suggests a more complex social and gendered territory. It raises the question of whether we need to develop more nuanced, gendered strategies of countering violent extremism. 9. Community, community, community All of the previous points require deep, long-lasting, inclusive partnerships with communities at a grassroots level. A signal weakness in transnational strategies to date has been the tendency of government agencies to focus relationship-building efforts on selected community leaders. These leaders, while important in some instances, are only part of the story. Communities are increasingly telling us that an older generation of leaders lacks the credibility, authority or authenticity to work effectively with younger community members who are radicalising towards violence. The central issue of trust – the single most important element in brokering successful joint efforts between governments and communities to mitigate violent extremism – goes well beyond developing trust and engagement with a relatively small number of community leaders. They may sometimes lack the backing of critical elements within their own constituencies. We must be smarter, more expansive and more multi-layered in developing community relationships. A multi-level strategy – one that targets and builds grassroots trust, transparency and engagement as well as cultivating leadership roles and government liaison – is far more likely to succeed in tackling violent extremism than one that is narrowly focused on selected representatives and structures. These structures often exclude women, young people and voices of difference or dissent within communities. These groups are precisely those we need to engage if we are to mount credible alternatives to violent extremism. This means listening carefully and genuinely to what communities are saying, and adopting not only a “whole of government” but a “whole of community” strategy. 10. Help researchers by sharing key data and information National security expert Marc Sageman recently published an essay calling for greater leverage of research capacity by government agencies concerned with countering violent extremism. Sageman focuses on ways in which government agencies 2 ̆ 7 reluctance to share primary source data have stalled research capabilities – an essential contribution to the evidence base on which strategies, policies and programs are founded. Intelligence agencies have the empirical data but not the methodological skills to analyse and interpret these; researchers have the analytical and methodological skills but lack the data. The result is that breakthroughs in understanding terrorism and how to counter it are being impeded. A smart strategy would develop security-sensitive ways of giving researchers the data they need. This would help spur transnational effectiveness by enabling researchers to develop the large, robust datasets and theoretical underpinnings that are essential to serious inquiry in this space. Without this, research remains a severely under-utilised resource.

40|$|This book {{explores the}} {{interface}} between terrorism and the Internet and presents contemporary approaches to understanding extremism online. The main themes covered in the book are: Terrorist propaganda on the internet; Internet radicalisation; Counter campaigns and approaches to disrupting internet radicalisation; Approaches to researching and understanding {{the role of the}} internet in radicalisation. Together, these four themes can be loosely grouped into two broad foci: (i) the phenomenon of <b>online</b> <b>radicalisation</b> through explorations of terrorists’ use of the internet; and, (ii) responses to this phenomenon through explorations of the policy and research agendas dealing with the growing influence of the internet in violent extremism. As such the book covers issues ranging along the gamut of how terrorists use the internet to how governments are responding to the increasing risk posed by exposure to online terroristic content. Existing books on terrorism and the internet tend to cover only one discrete aspect, such as terrorist use of the internet for propaganda, or are grounded in only one research discipline such as information technology. This book brings together expertise from different disciplines and different regions (Europe, the US, Canada and Australia) in a volume that explores some of the outstanding questions, such as the role of the internet in radicalisation; the reasons why terroristic propaganda is or is not influencing violent extremists; the role of political conflict in <b>online</b> <b>radicalisation</b> and the future of research into terrorism and the internet. This range of interests has never before been covered by a single volume and the book will make a unique and timely addition to the current collections on a growing and international market. This book will be of much interest to students of cyber-security, internet politics, terrorism studies, media and communications studies, and IR generally...|$|E

The exploitation of modern communication technology by radical groups has caused concerns that online spaces may become increasingly important domains for radicalisation. This research has sought to study radicalisation pathways online {{in order to better}} understand how the radicalisation process online may be disrupted. To this end, this paper makes use of social network analysis methodology in order to empirically map a radical group's online community so that group accounts may be compared. This allows for their role within the radicalisation process, as well as their susceptibility to account suspension as a tool of radicalisation disruption, to be assessed. This analysis identifies three different roles online accounts may fulfil in the <b>online</b> <b>radicalisation</b> process and how they differ in susceptibility to suspension: (1) Beacon roles act to attract new users to the group. These accounts are the most susceptible to suspension as they would find it difficult to regain their audience post-suspension. (2) Recruiter roles engage users who [...] .

We shouldn’t flinch from verbally confronting those promoting intolerant, separatist and anti-democratic doctrines.   All Australian governments must tread a fine line between respecting the right to free speech and dealing with those who promote extremism.

Therefore, the main goals of this project will be twofold: On the one hand, it is needed to identify the main features and characteristics {{that can be used to}} evaluate a risk situation, to do that a risk assessment methodology studying how to detect signs of radicalisation (e. g., use of language, behavioural patterns in social networks [...] .) will be designed. On the other hand, these features will be tested and analysed using advanced data mining methods, knowledge representation (semantic and ontology engineering) and multilingual technologies. The innovative aspect of this project is to not offer just a methodology on risk assessment, but also a tool that is build based on this methodology, so that the prosecutors, judges, law enforcement and other actors can obtain a short term tangible results.

40|$|Analysis {{of online}} social network traffic can {{identify}} a cascade as it flows through a community but, often, {{the reasons for}} its initiation are tacit. Commercial measures of online influence focus on the consequences of influence not the causes and have been criticized as lacking efficacy. This research uses social capital and personal influence theories to investigate the characteristics and behaviours that allow certain network nodes {{to be able to}} cascade ideas (or memes) through networks. The relationships between structural, relational and cognitive sources of social capital and two distinct dimensions of influence are investigated using: interviews with experts in the field, focus groups of social network users and 1, 970 respondents from three large-scale online communities. Data has been analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and allows the researcher to develop robust conclusions on the antecedents to influence. These help to explain recent contradictory findings by different researchers in studies using Social Network Analysis (SNA). The dimensions of influence measured are: respondents’ intention to propagate the message and; {{the extent to which the}} message has affected their perception of the subject. The model of influence that leads to both dimensions is strikingly similar; presenting strong support for the notion that contagion-based cascades through networks are predictors of perception change. The paper proposes a bridge between the theories of social capital and personal influence and this is considered an original contribution to these well-established theories. Techniques are suggested which can help organisations to identify opinion-leaders and, if required, subvert or redirect the nature of their influence. Other applications are considered in the fields of: Innovation (identification of lead users); Virtual Organisations (engaging with informal leaders and influencers in networks); Cyber- Defence (identification and subversion of <b>online</b> <b>radicalisation)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The {{internet}} {{is at the}} centre of modern life. It can facilitate understanding between people of different cultures and promote a sense of global community. At the same time, however, {{it can be a}} powerful tool for terrorists to promote extremist ideology and hatred. The writings of terrorist groups are regularly posted on websites in our region. And extremists use various web forums and chat rooms to entice new recruits. Convicted terrorists have given evidence about the influence of the internet in their recruitment and communication strategies. Although the internet has become an important tool for tactical operations such as bombings, psychological warfare and fundraising, the focus in this paper is on its use as a tool to radicalise potential supporters. This study found that the internet has contributed to radicalisation, will probably grow in regional significance, and might become the dominant factor in radicalisation in the region. And it’s not just passive websites that are important in this context: social networking sites of all kinds, such as blogs and forums, are evolving rapidly. This paper discusses several policy approaches to counter the use of the internet for radicalisation in our region. These include blocking sites, creating counternarrative websites to promote tolerance, and intelligence-led methods to tackle the problem. In preparing this report, the authors canvassed a range of views among officials in Australia and the region, {{as well as those of}} industry representatives and community stakeholders. The project was carried out jointly by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
