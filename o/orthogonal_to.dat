5|$|The F571 {{extension}} is <b>orthogonal</b> <b>to</b> {{the presence}} of the boolean datatype in SQL (discussed later in this article) and, despite syntactic similarities, F571 does not introduce boolean or three-valued literals in the language. The F571 extension was actually present in SQL92, well before the boolean datatype was introduced to the standard in 1999. The F571 extension is implemented by few systems however; PostgreSQL is one of those implementing it.|$|E

25|$|A {{common problem}} in {{computer}} graphics is {{to generate a}} non-zero vector in R3 that is <b>orthogonal</b> <b>to</b> a given non-zero one. There is no single continuous function that can do this for all non-zero vector inputs. This is a corollary of the hairy ball theorem. To see this, consider the given vector as the radius of a sphere and note that finding a non-zero vector <b>orthogonal</b> <b>to</b> the given one is equivalent to finding a non-zero vector that is tangent {{to the surface of}} that sphere where it touches the radius. However, the hairy ball theorem says there exists no continuous function that can do this for every point on the sphere (i.e. every given vector).|$|E
