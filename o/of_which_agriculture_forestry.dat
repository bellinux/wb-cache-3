40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{document}} the different steps followed to construct the Tunisian Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for the year 2012. More precisely, it describes the estimation methods and the nature of data used in the development <b>of</b> the SAM, <b>which</b> has a specific focus on the agriculture and food sectors. The SAM also features a regional disaggregation by three agro-ecological zones. The data used in the construction process are based on two main publications of the “Institut National de la Statistique” (INS) : the input-output table (I/O) (2012) and the supply-use table (2012). The I/O (2012) disaggregates the Tunisian economy into 24 sectors, including two agri-food sectors: (1) Agriculture and Fishery, and (2) Food Industries. The supply-use table accounts for about 400 commodities, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> 59 are <b>agriculture,</b> <b>forestry,</b> and fishery products and 64 are processed-food products. Other major information sources used include the household survey publication (2010), the annual report of the Central Bank (2013), the “Annuaire des Statistiques Agricoles” (Ministry of Agriculture 2013 c), and the “Budget Economique” (2013).

40|$|The Forest Geospatial Information & Survey Lab in {{cooperation}} with Aeroscan Precision (M) Sdn Bhd at Lebuh Silikon, Universiti Putra Malaysia, spent {{the last four years}} developing airborne hyperspectral remote sensing and GIS applications, many <b>of</b> <b>which</b> address <b>agriculture,</b> <b>forestry</b> and the environment. This paper wants to make clear from the outset. Despite the lack of significant commercial success for businesses trying to sell airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data and services to agriculture, the only currently available imaging technology being pioneered and developed in UPM, does work. There is no doubt of its benefits to the agriculture industry especially the oil palm plantation giants in saving money, time, increasing yield, enhancing best practices, protecting the environment, and more. Despite that, the company just not made a “real” business of it perhaps due to the market for airborne hyperspectral remote sensing products and services related to agriculture, is still not known to most state and federal departments and agencies on the other. The consumer, for now, is not really in the picture. The commercial side can be broken down into the growers, who produce the food, Farmers Coops that may include growers but also produce food products and food providers. While some states have huge agricultural bases, few have money to invest in airborne hyperspectral remote sensing, which leaves quite a lot of burden on the federal government. The UPM-Aeroscan Precision (M) Sdn Bhd experience launched in 2004, planned to serve the commercial agricultural market by bringing the benefits of airborne hyperspectral remote sensing, also provide a real-time “GIS-ready” made database, and timely crop yield information to the plantation sector and farmer. The vision was simple: the farmer would build his own real-time airborne remote sensing GIS-ready made database documenting fertilizer, watering and planting details in the software (something typically done in a notebook by future high-tech Malaysian graduated farmers) {{with the use of a}} crop model to predict the expected yield. The check was to compare that expected outcome to the reality of the airborne hyperspectral remotely sensing images. For that level of detail, the UPM-APSB’s AISA very high resolution airborne hyperspectral imagery (1 m), and in near real-time could only provide the solution for the Malaysian modern generation farmers in the hope that computer technology will reach them. In this paper, what UPM-APSB’s AISA airborne hyperspectral remote sensing can bring to agriculture is demonstrated. First off, it can be used to monitor yields, early in the season, and then later. Second, airborne hyperspectral remote sensing can delineate soil zones. A third area of benefit is in field delineation where the boundaries of crops, in support of regulatory procedures could be easily found. The final area is precision agriculture, about best practices, giving a crop just the water, fertilizer, herbicide, etc. it needs to grow to its potential, but no more. The authors feel strongly that precision agriculture could have a significant impact on the Malaysian future environment. If the UPM-APSB’s AISA near real-time data can map and provide just enough nitrogen, the impact on the environment is reduced and the plants should still provide their maximum yield. Applying this just enough vision should save the farmer’s money on herbicide, water, fertilizer and other such costs. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{scientific}} and human dimensions of global change have many overlapping themes which offer {{a focus on}} processes occurring at the continental surface. Soil moisture is of critical importance to the physical processes governing energy and water exchanges at the land/air boundary. Soil moisture controls {{the extent to which}} plants can exploit sunlight in photosynthesis and the effectiveness with <b>which</b> <b>agriculture,</b> <b>forestry</b> and freshwater resources can be developed. The importance of the soil moisture to many, diverse communities has resulted in a very large collection of numerical models all <b>of</b> <b>which</b> simulate soil moisture, This paper outlines why and how a series of soil moisture simulation intercomparisons were conducted in a one-year exercise jointly sponsored by the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme and the World Climate Research Programme. 1. The landsurface and global change Global change encompasses physical processes, biogeochemistry and human systems. This is particu-larly clear when near-surface continental processes are considered. The landsurface is where radiant energy is converted into living material through pho-tosynthesis, into evaporation often via transpiration, into sensible heat and into radiant energy of longer wavelength. Moreover, human welfare depends criti-cally upon climatic conditions near the continental surface as this is where crops are grown and fresh water is collected. The physics of the landsurface cannot be separated from its biochemistry nor fro...|$|R

40|$|In {{the city}} of Biguaçu, state of Santa Catarina in {{southern}} Brazil, family farmers practice a kind of natural land use in <b>which</b> <b>agriculture,</b> <b>forestry</b> and energy production are related. These farmers regularly practice fallow agriculture in secondary subtropical forests (Atlantic Forest biome), with production {{of energy in the}} form of charcoal. We aim at assessing the sustainability of the livelihoods of farm families through the analysis of access to assets or capital, categorized as natural, human, financial, social, physical and cultural capital, according to the approach of sustainable livelihoods. The fieldwork involved various techniques of ethnographic approach with members of 5 families of Três Riachos community, from 2012 to 2014. It is concluded that the natural capital asset access is possible in their own family property, and still be a renewable resource. As for human, physical and financial capital, it appears that in this production system, there is excessive and often unhealthy labor, using poor technologies and infrastructure. In the social capital, we emphasize the relationships of trust and reciprocity existing among farmers and external actors. Allied to this asset, there is the cultural capital, highlighting reciprocity characteristics with external agents, especially their customers. To promote the sustainability of livelihoods it is essential to facilitate full access to this capital, or increase access to those assets already established, such as the cultural capital. Thus, it is concluded that the analyzed livelihoods have the potential to be sustainable...|$|R

40|$|There is {{interest}} in {{society in general}} and in the agricultural and forestry sectors concerning a land-based role in greenhouse gas mitigation reduction. Numerous studies have estimated the potential supply schedules at <b>which</b> <b>agriculture</b> and <b>forestry</b> could produce greenhouse gas offsets. However, such studies vary widely in critical assumptions regarding economic market adjustments, allowed scope of mitigation alternatives, and region of focus. Here, we {{examine the effects of}} using different assumptions on the total emission mitigation supply curve from <b>agriculture</b> and <b>forestry</b> in the United States. To do this we employ the U. S. -based Agricultural Sector and Mitigation of Greenhouse Gas Model and find that variations in such factors can have profound effects on the results. Differences between commonly employed methods shift economic mitigation potentials from - 55 to + 85 %. The bias is stronger at higher carbon prices due to afforestation and energy crop plantations that reduce supply of traditional commodities. Lower carbon prices promote management changes with smaller impacts on commodity supply. Copyright 2006 International Association of Agricultural Economists. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{three main}} {{political}} groupings in Britain (the Conservative Party, the Labour Party, and the Liberal/Social Democratic Party Alliance), the two nationalist parties (Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party), and the Ecology Party are now unanimous in accepting conservation {{as a legitimate}} policy goal. But they are far from unanimous {{when it comes to}} proposing the means by which conservation goals should be achieved. These party divisions are particularly marked in relation to the most critical rural conservation issue of the day, that is, the extent to <b>which</b> <b>agriculture</b> and <b>forestry</b> should be controlled to benefit conservation interests. This paper is a review of the relevant policies of the six main political parties. It identifies in particular those that advocate an extension of planning controls and whether to farming but not forestry, to forestry but not farming, or to both these activities. This produces interesting contrasts from which, by their willingness to implement controls that favour conservation, it is tempting to judge the parties' conservation credentials. But, although all six parties view conservation as a desirable goal, it is, for all but one, subordinate to more important aims and ideals. As such, it may not be surprising that conservation policies appear to reflect party ideology and interest rather than conservation commitment. ...|$|R

The economy started to improve in the year 2000, but non-economic fundamental factors significantly impacted the economy at that time. The results of this paper indicate that employment has a relationship to economic growth. In West Java farm activities, <b>which</b> are <b>agriculture,</b> livestock, <b>forestry,</b> and fisheries (ALFF), have a negative correlation with economic growth. On the other hand, non-farm activities have a positive correlation with economic growth.
