25|$|Also new for 1968 was the Rebel 550 Convertible, {{the last}} AMC convertible, which {{replaced}} the American. The 550 was the base level convertible {{as the top}} trim version moved from 770 to the SST model joining the two-door hardtop. The two SST body styles featured more trim and features that included individually adjustable and reclining front seats, as well as simulated air-intakes ahead of the rear wheels. The interiors of AMC's Rebel made extensive use of a new <b>olefin</b> <b>fiber</b> carpeting.|$|E
50|$|The first {{commercial}} producer of an <b>olefin</b> <b>fiber</b> in the United States was Hercules, Inc. (FiberVisions). Other U.S. <b>olefin</b> <b>fiber</b> producers include Asota; American Fibers and Yarns Co; American Synthetic Fiber, LLC; Color-Fi; FiberVisions; Foss Manufacturing Co., LLC; Drake Extrusion; Filament Fiber Technology, Inc.; TenCate Geosynthetics; Universal Fiber Systems LLC.|$|E
50|$|<b>Olefin</b> <b>fiber</b> is a {{synthetic}} fiber {{made from a}} polyolefin, such as polypropylene or polyethylene. It is used in wallpaper, carpeting, ropes, and vehicle interiors.|$|E
50|$|Italy began {{production}} of <b>olefin</b> <b>fibers</b> in 1957. The chemist Giulio Natta successfully formulated olefin suitable for more textile applications. Both Natta and Karl Ziegler were later awarded the Nobel Prize {{for their work}} on transition metal catalysis of <b>olefins</b> to <b>fiber,</b> also known as Ziegler-Natta catalysis. U.S. {{production of}} <b>olefin</b> <b>fibers</b> began in 1960. <b>Olefin</b> <b>fibers</b> account for 16% of all manufactured fibers.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{polymers}} {{that can be used in}} <b>olefin</b> <b>fibers.</b> The first, polyethylene, is a simple linear structure with repeating units. These fibers are used mainly for ropes, twines and utility fabrics.|$|R
50|$|Polymerization of {{propylene}} and ethylene gases, controlled {{with special}} catalysts, creates <b>olefin</b> <b>fibers.</b> Dye is added {{directly to the}} polymer before melt spinning is applied. Additives, polymer variations and different process conditions can create a range of characteristics.|$|R
5000|$|The Federal Trade Commission's {{official}} {{definition of}} <b>olefin</b> <b>fiber</b> is “A manufactured fiber {{in which the}} fiber forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polymer composed of at least 85% by weight of ethylene, propylene, or other olefin units” ...|$|E
50|$|Tyvek is a {{nonwoven}} product {{consisting of}} spunbond <b>olefin</b> <b>fiber.</b> It was first discovered in 1955 by DuPont researcher Jim White who saw polyethylene fluff {{coming out of}} a pipe in a DuPont experimental lab. It was trademarked in 1965 and was first introduced for commercial purposes in April 1967.|$|E
50|$|Also new for 1968 was the Rebel 550 Convertible, {{the last}} AMC convertible, which {{replaced}} the American.

50|$|<b>Olefin</b> <b>fibers</b> can be multi- or {{monofilament}} and staple, tow, or film yarns. The fibers are colorless {{and round}} in cross section. This cross section {{can be modified}} for different end uses. The physical characteristics are a waxy feel and colorless.|$|R
50|$|<b>Olefin</b> <b>fibers</b> {{have great}} bulk and cover while having low {{specific}} gravity. This means “Warmth without the weight.” The fibers have low moisture absorption, {{but they can}} wick moisture and dry quickly. Olefin is abrasion, stain, sunlight, fire, and chemical resistant. It does not dye well, but {{has the advantage of}} being colorfast. Since Olefin has a low melting point, textiles can be thermally bonded. The fibers have the lowest static of all manufactured fibers and a medium luster. One of the most important properties of olefin is its strength. It keeps its strength in wet or dry conditions and is very resilient. The fiber can be produced for strength of different properties.|$|R
50|$|Solution dyeing, {{also known}} as dope or spun dyeing, {{is the process of}} adding {{pigments}} or insoluble dyes to the spinning solution before the solution is extruded through the spinneret. Only manufactured fibers can be solution-dyed. It is used for difficult-to-dye <b>fibers,</b> such as <b>olefin</b> <b>fibers,</b> and for dyeing fibers for end uses that require excellent colorfastness properties. Because the color pigments {{become a part of the}} fiber, solution-dyed materials have excellent colorfastness to light, washing, crocking (rubbing), perspiration, and bleach. Dyeing at the solution stage is more expensive, since the equipment has to be cleaned thoroughly each time a different color is produced. Thus, the variety of colors and shades produced is limited. In addition, it is difficult to stock the inventory for each color. Decisions regarding color have to be made very early in the manufacturing process. Thus, this stage of dyeing is usually not used for apparel fabrics.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{there are}} {{numerous}} types of modern Berber carpet made {{from a wide variety}} of materials, Nylon, <b>Olefin</b> <b>fiber,</b> and wool are the most frequently used materials, Except Tunisian Berber carpets and rugs usually called “Mergoum” which still preserve a know how inherited from ancestral weaving methods. Tunisian authorities are still controlling every piece to guarantee quality and that 'Berber' spirit in designs, patterns and symbols knotted so only wool is permitted with a total ban of any synthetic material, then each rug or carpet is sealed with a red wax sign (of Tunisian handicrafts authorities).|$|E
50|$|Avoid dry {{cleaning}} Olefin as many dry-cleaning solvents can swell the fibers. Since Olefin dries quickly, line drying and low tumble drying {{with little or}} no heat is the recommended method of drying. Since Olefin is not absorbent, waterborne stains do not present a problem. However, oily stains are difficult to remove. Most such stains can be removed with lukewarm water and detergent, but bleach can also be used. <b>Olefin</b> <b>fiber</b> has a low melting point (around 225 to 335 °F, depending on the polymer's grade) so items should be ironed at a very low temperature, if at all. Items such as outdoor carpets and other fabrics can be hosed off. Olefin is easy to recycle.|$|E
50|$|Current USAF evasion charts, {{introduced}} {{immediately before}} Operation Desert Storm, and also issued to many allied air forces, are printed on spunbond <b>olefin</b> <b>fiber</b> polymer sheet and are waterproof and extremely strong. They include survival navigation instructions using the US lensatic compass and basic celestial orientation for use when lacking a compass or GPS, {{use of the}} survival radio, edible and dangerous plants, fish, and animals found in the map area, sea current flow rates, first aid instructions, and other localized survival tips. The maps are camouflage patterned {{and can be used}} as a blanket, sun cover, splint, food or water carrier, and wound cover in addition to assisting in navigation, they are large enough to even use as a sleeping wrap. USAF Captain Scott O'Grady, brought down by hostile fire over Bosnia in 1996, later wrote “When I was finally settled in, I pulled my evasion chart from my G-suit pocket and began to plot the longitude and latitude coordinates I’d gotten from my GPS receiver last night… It showed all the hills valleys, rivers, and land features around me. On the legend was other helpful information about local vegetation and animals”. Captain O'Grady found the chart so large that he cut out his evasion area to make it more usable.|$|E
40|$|Gas¿liquid {{membrane}} contactors frequently {{suffer from}} undesired wetting of the microporous membrane by the absorption liquid. Stabilization layers at the liquid-side of the microporous membrane potentially prevent this wetting. We apply such stabilized membranes in a membrane contactor using AgNO 3 solutions as absorption liquid, to separate paraffins and <b>olefins.</b> Hollow <b>fiber</b> membrane modules with an effective {{surface area of}} 101. 8 cm 2, containing 10 composite membranes with an 8 ¿m thick, defect free ethylene propylene diene terpolymer (EPDM) top layer are prepared. An absorption and desorption module operated continuously in a membrane contactor process for more than 20 weeks without any change in membrane performance. In the absorber, transport of ethylene is highly enhanced by the chemical reaction and desorption {{turned out to be}} the limiting step in this separation process. The influence of feed pressure, liquid flow rate, and AgNO 3 (aq) concentration is investigated and the results are evaluated in terms of ethylene productivity and ethylene over ethane selectivity. Ethylene productivities range from 2. 1 × 10 ¿ 6 to 6. 1 × 10 ¿ 6 cm 3 /cm 2 s cmHg and gas mixture selectivities range from 72. 5 to 14. ...|$|R
