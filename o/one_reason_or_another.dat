5|$|During {{the long}} history of the British science fiction {{television}} programme Doctor Who, a number of stories were proposed but, for a variety of reasons, never fully produced. Below is a list of unmade serials which were submitted by recognised professional writers and the BBC had intended to produce, but for <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> were not made. Many have since been the subject of a feature in Doctor Who Magazine, or other professional periodicals or books devoted to the television show.|$|E
5|$|The see of Philadelphia {{had been}} vacant {{since the death}} of Bishop Michael Francis Egan in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it. Archbishop John Carroll of Baltimore, whose {{province}} included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> and others (including the apostolic administrator, Louis de Barth) had turned the job down. Part of the delay was logistical—Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province—but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches {{in a part of the}} nation with few Catholics. There was also a significant dispute (known as trusteeism) over the rights of churches' lay trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization. In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.|$|E
5|$|A {{preponderance}} of historians favour {{the story that}} though the Victorious had sailed through the Lombok Strait rather than the Sunda, Britain had come off easily the best through {{a show of force}} during the Sunda Straits Crisis. Numerous accounts, including Gregory Fremont-Barnes' History of Counterinsurgency, are content with a simplified version that Indonesia closed the Strait for <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> and that the arrival of the task force assembled around the aging carrier had intimidated Sukarno into reopening it. A common argument is that the passage was an effective and daring show of force, and often ignores the Sunda Strait issue altogether. This was a sentiment shown by the crew of the Victorious herself, who during their passage through the Lombok Strait went to action stations at the sight of an Indonesian submarine and prepared to fire on it if there was any sign of hostility, and believed that the Indonesians thought it wiser to hold back in fear of their power. This was not a view that the British official reports sought to dissuade, depicting the result as a compromise concession by the Indonesians, who had in brinksmanship terms, 'blinked first' after British refusal to back down. The Foreign Office even went to the extremity of claiming that the Lombok Strait was just as convenient for passage as the Sunda Strait, despite its far greater distance from Singapore and Australia. At the very least, the subsequent Indonesian United Nations defeat and Abdul Rahman's agreement to avoid retaliation was a very positive result for Britain to take from the incident.|$|E

25|$|Radio Luxembourg {{also served}} as a refuge for stars and shows {{previously}} heard on the BBC but with whom the BBC had fallen out for <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> Thus, when in 1951 the BBC wanted Vera Lynn, one of its biggest singing stars, to perform more upbeat material than her traditional repertoire, she refused, and signed up to record 42 shows for Luxembourg instead – which, she said, also paid better. Likewise, the comedy series Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh, terminated by the BBC after six years, transferred to Radio Luxembourg for a period in 1950–51 before the BBC relented and revived the show.|$|E

By that time the Arab villagers, having seen what had happened elsewhere, had become adamant about staying put {{in their homes and}} on their lands.

In places where this was not to their advantage for <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> the army would resort to forceful expulsion.

He was a shrewd cricket captain {{with years of}} experience; Tom Graveney thought him the best captain he served under, and Graveney played under every England captain from 1951 to 1969. In the field Cowdrey {{preferred}} to set the best field for his bowlers and stick to it rather than make constant changes. His greatest asset was the care he took over his players, always thanking bowlers after they had bowled a spell and batsmen {{when they returned to}} the pavilion.|$|E
25|$|Clarke {{failed to}} win a Stanley Cup over the 22 seasons he was a general manager with Philadelphia, Minnesota, and Florida. During his 19 seasons as Flyers manager over two stints, the Flyers reached the Stanley Cup finals three times and amassed a regular season record of 714–443–199, but for <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> always came up short of a Cup title. Clarke's Flyers in 1985 and 1987 were {{considered}} underdogs to the powerhouse Edmonton Oilers, as were his North Stars to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1991. In his second tenure as Flyers manager, the team lost in the postseason, frequently to lower-seeded teams. While goaltending was a strength during his first tenure with two Vezina Trophy winners between the pipes (Pelle Lindbergh and Ron Hextall), only Hextall in 1995, a combination of Hextall and Garth Snow in 1997, Brian Boucher in 2000, and Robert Esche in 2004 got the Flyers past {{the second round of}} the playoffs during his second stint. By contrast the New Jersey Devils, their Atlantic Division rivals, were stable in net with Martin Brodeur and beat the Flyers in the Conference Finals en route to Stanley Cups in 1995 and 2000.|$|E

500|$|With around 55,000 [...] soldiers, the Army of Northern Virginia {{was about}} evenly matched with the Federals, and with Lee at the helm, notably more aggressive.

500|$|A {{number of}} species {{assigned}} to Allosaurus are no longer recognized as valid, for <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> A. lucaris, another Marsh name, was given to a partial skeleton in 1878. He later decided it warranted its own genus, Labrosaurus, but {{this has not been}} accepted, and A. lucaris is also regarded as another specimen of A. fragilis. Allosaurus lucaris, is known mostly from vertebrae, sharing characters with Allosaurus. Paul and Carpenter stated that the type specimen of this species, YPM 1931, was from a younger age than Allosaurus, and might represent a different genus. However, they found that the specimen was undiagnostic, and thus A. lucaris was a nomen dubium.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V.

Phipps felt that the first season was [...] "a near-perfect run of television", further describing it as [...] "a stretch of greatness that, for <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> couldn't be sustained. But it was terrific while it lasted". AllRovi Andrea LeVasseur awarded the episode four stars out of five, adding that [...] "with several characters meeting their fate in this episode, including the two main suspects (Jacques and Leo), the mystery of Laura Palmer's murder is even more puzzling". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker rated the episode an A+, finding that its lack of plot resolution offered [...] "a good kind of annoyance", showing the level of interest and commitment the series had inspired in its viewers.|$|E
