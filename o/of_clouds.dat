5|$|A {{research}} paper published {{ten years after}} the storm suggested that Gay could have been stronger than Typhoon Tip, which attained the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded. While at its peak intensity, Gay registered a rating of 8.0 for nine consecutive hours using the Dvorak technique, indicating sustained wind speeds of at least (315km/h) 195mph. In addition, the cyclone had a significantly colder band <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> around the eye. Typhoon Angela in 1995 presented similar features and could have been stronger than Gay. Neither of the two had direct observations into their eyes, however, making it impossible to confirm such intensity.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather near Panama {{drifted to}} a location south of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca, and organized into Tropical Depression Four-E on July 9. It moved westward through {{a hostile environment}} of strong shear. The wind shear disrupted the cyclone's convection and weakened its circulation. Despite the shear, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm early on July 12 and was named Cristina. This broke down the steering ridge, and Cristina turned {{to the north and}} peaked on July 14. Then, the wind shear won out and Cristina quickly weakened. Cristina dissipated into a swirl <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> on July 16, without ever threatening land. No impact was reported.|$|E

5|$|Julia {{consisted}} of mainly a low-level swirl <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> by late on September16; however, minimal convection kept the storm at the minimum requirements for a tropical cyclone.

While moving north, the remnants of Julia then transitioned into a weak extratropical cyclone and made a small westward turn before dissipating inland over North Carolina on September21.|$|E

40|$|Two {{problems}} are researched, {{one is that}} the existing results did not reveal the essence factor that determines the atomized property <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> model; the other one is that error <b>of</b> backward <b>cloud</b> model with uncertainty is relatively large.

The analysis and experiment results show that the range of atomized factor corresponded to cloud distribution is from 3 to 18; when it is greater than 18, cloud distribution will reduce to normal distribution, and backward cloud model with uncertainty is no longer applicable. And then, the four order origin moment <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> distribution is used to estimate the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> model, thus presenting a new algorithm <b>of</b> backward <b>cloud</b> model with uncertainty.
