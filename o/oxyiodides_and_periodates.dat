The TiO 2 nanotubes prepared in the two-step anodization process showed better photo-catalytic activity than TiO 2 nanotubes prepared in one-step anodization process. Also, compared with TiO 2 nanotubes without the UV pretreatment, the TiO 2 nanotubes pretreated in a methanol solution under UV light irradiation exhibited significant enhancements in both photocurrent and activity.

40|$|Nanocellulose has {{a variety}} of advantages, which make the {{material}} most suitable for use in biomedical devices such as wound dressings. The material is strong, allows for production of transparent films, provides a moist wound healing environment, and can form elastic gels with bioresponsive characteristics. In this study, we explore the application of nanocellulose as a bioink for modifying film surfaces by a bioprinting process. Two different nanocelluloses were used, prepared with TEMPO mediated oxidation and a combination of carboxymethylation <b>and</b> <b>periodate</b> oxidation. The combination of carboxymethylation <b>and</b> <b>periodate</b> oxidation produced a homogeneous material with short nanofibrils, having widths < 20 nm and lengths < 200 nm. The small dimensions of the nanofibrils reduced the viscosity of the nanocellulose, thus yielding a material with good rheological properties for use as a bioink. The nanocellulose bioink was thus used for printing 3 D porous structures, which is exemplified in this study. We also demonstrated that both nanocelluloses did not support bacterial growth, which is an interesting property of these novel materials. cited By 4 </p...|$|R
