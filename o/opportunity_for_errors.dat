VIPER is designed to optimise repetitive project cycles (in this case, aircraft maintenance and repair programs) in a data rich environment. Business and project communities are facing a number of contradictory trends:-· The downsizing and deskilling of their work forces, particularly in the technical support, engineering and middle management areas · The increase in litigation and lack of tolerance towards any processing errors and/or omissions and · The need to be ever more efficient with reduced project budgets and shorter delivery timeframes. The combination of these factors is creating pressures on business systems (with particular reference to project control systems) to deliver enhanced efficiency and process integrity whilst minimising the <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>errors.</b> The VIPER system is used to manage and schedule aircraft deep level maintenance programs for the ADF {{and a number of}} commercial businesses.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{clinical}} {{relevance of}} and risk {{factors associated with}} errors related to medication administration time were studied. METHODS: In this explorative study, 66 medication administration rounds were studied on two wards (surgery and neurology) of a hospital. Data on medication errors were collected using the blister collection method. The emptied packaging material of medication was collected after each round and compared with each patient's medication orders. Administration time errors were defined as medication administration (actual intake) occurring more than one hour {{before or after the}} prescribed time. Generalized estimating equations analysis was performed to study the correlation between medication administration errors and risk factors. RESULTS: Data from 129 patients were included in the study. Among these 129 patients, 2874 <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> <b>error</b> were recorded. The majority of <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> <b>error</b> occurred during the 7 a. m. round. Within the 2874 <b>opportunities</b> <b>for</b> <b>errors,</b> 10 administration time <b>errors</b> occurred <b>for</b> medications that might interact with food or another medication. Time of administration (noon and 3 p. m.), route of administration (injection or infusion), and frequency of administration (if necessary) had significant protective effects against the occurrence of administration time errors. The rectal route of administration was associated with {{a significant increase in the}} frequency of administration time errors compared with the oral route. A clinically relevant administration time error occurred in 2 cases (0. 07 %). CONCLUSION: Analysis of medication administration rounds found time errors to be the most common medication error...|$|R

A {{number of studies}} outlined that pharmacy-led medication reconciliation (MR) might facilitate safer information transfer and medication use. MR practice is not well standardised and often delivered {{in combination with other}} healthcare activities. The question regarding the effects and costs of pharmacy-led MR and the optimum MR practice is warranted of value. Objectives: To review the evidence for the effects and costs/ cost-effectiveness of complete pharmacy-led MR in hospital settings. Methods: A systematic review searching the following database was conducted up to the 13 th December 2015; EMBASE & MEDLINE Ovid, CINAHL and the Cochrane library. Studies evaluating pharmacy-led MR performed fully from admission till discharges were included. Studies evaluated non-pharmacy-led MR at only one end of patient care or transfer were not included. Articles were screened and extracted independently by two investigators. Studies were divided into those in which: MR was the primary element of the intervention and labelled as “primarily MR” studies, or MR combined with non-MR care activities and labelled as “supplemented MR” studies. Quality assessment of studies was performed by independent reviewers using a pre-defined and validated tool. Results: The literature search identified 4, 065 citations, of which 13 implemented complete MR. The lack of evidence precluded addressing the effects and costs of MR. Conclusions: The composite of optimum MR practice is not widely standardised and requires discussion among health professions and key organisations. Research focused on evaluating cost-effectiveness of pharmacy-led MR is lacking...|$|E
40|$|Glucose {{testing in}} the {{hospital}} with point-of-care devices presents multiple opportunities for error. Any device can fail under the right conditions. For glucose monitoring in the hospital, with thousands of operators, hundreds of devices, and dozens of locations involved, there is ample <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>errors</b> that can impact the quality of test results. Errors can occur in any phase of the testing process: preanalytic, analytic, or postanalytic. Common sources of meter error include patient or methodology interferences, operator mistakes, environmental exposure, and device malfunction. Early models of glucose meters had few internal checks or capability to warn the operator of meter problems. The latest generation of glucose monitors has a number of internal checks and controls engineered into the testing process to prevent serious errors or warn the operator by suppressing test results. Some of these control processes are built into the software and data management system of the meters, others require the hospital to do something, such as regularly clean the meter or analyze control samples of known glucose concentration, to verify meter performance. Hospitals {{need to be aware of}} the potential for errors by understanding weaknesses in the testing process that could lead to erroneous results and take steps to prevent errors from occurring or to minimize the harm to patients when errors do occur. The reliability of a glucose result will depend on the balance of internal control features available from manufacturers in conjunction with the liquid control analysis and other control processes (operator training, device validation, and maintenance) utilized by the hospitals...|$|E
30|$|The {{prior use}} of {{electronic}} prescribing at Hospital A for 8  years {{meant that the}} integrated medicines management processes were well established. The delivery of products to the wards links in with these processes. Typically, most wards (30 out of 36) receive a medicines management service. Each ward can expect 0.75 WTE pharmacists, and 0.5 WTE technician time per week. Changes in skill-mix in out-patient department equates to an additional saving on top of staff reduction of 16 %. Data from the control chart suggest de-skilling the dispensary workforce using robots has no impact on dispensing errors. Towards the end of 2009, {{there was an increase}} in dispensing errors, which was in part due to the consequences of the installation programme. This is where control charts proved useful to monitor the processes, especially when dealing with small numbers. A previous paper (Beard and Candlish, 2004) listed the different types of dispensing methods at Hospital A, and the error rates associated with them. Figure  2 shows a spike in errors just after installation. Error analysis showed them to be non-robot errors, i.e. they were picking errors from those shelves of the pharmacy where items cannot go into robots (part packs, round tubs of medicines, or items too small to be labelled by robot). Significantly, we have found zero errors for the robot plus electronic prescribing system combined, based on around 800, 000 items per annum. This represents a huge benefit in safety. However, dispensing is not risk-free, since not all items are supplied and labelled from the robot. However, the <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>errors</b> is significantly reduced.|$|E
40|$|Medication {{errors are}} among the most common medical errors in the hospitals. Transcription error is a {{specific}} type of medication errors and is due to data entry error that is commonly made by the human operators.

40|$|CONTEXT: Drug {{administration}} in the hospital setting is the last barrier before a possible error reaches the patient. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze the prevalence and nature of administration error rate detected by the observation method. DATA SOURCES: Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library from 1966 to December 2011 and reference lists of included studies. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies, cross-sectional studies, before-and-after studies, and randomized controlled trials that measured the rate of administration errors in inpatients were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers (senior pharmacists) independently identified studies for inclusion. One reviewer extracted the data; the second reviewer checked the data. The main outcome was the error rate calculated as being the number of errors without wrong time errors divided by the Total <b>Opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>Errors</b> (TOE, sum {{of the total number}} of doses ordered plus the unordered doses given), and multiplied by 100. For studies that reported it, clinical impact was reclassified into four categories from fatal to minor or no impact. Due to a large heterogeneity, results were expressed as median values (interquartile range, IQR), according to their study design. RESULTS: Among 2088 studies, a total of 52 reported TOE. Most of the studies were cross-sectional studies (N= 46). The median error rate without wrong time errors for the cross-sectional studies using TOE was 10. 5 % [IQR: 7. 3 %- 21. 7 %]. No fatal error was observed and most errors were classified as minor in the 18 studies in which clinical impact was analyzed. We did not find any evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Administration errors are frequent among inpatients. The median error rate without wrong time errors for the cross-sectional studies using TOE was about 10 %. A standardization of administration error rate using the same denominator (TOE), numerator and types of errors is essential for further publications...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] Although {{researchers}} have consistently {{shown that the}} implicit coordination provided by transactive memory positively affects team performance, the benefits of transactive memory systems depend heavily on team members’ ability to accurately identify the expertise of their teammates and communicate expertise-specific information with one another. This introduces the <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>errors</b> to enter the system, as the expertise of individual team members may be misunderstood or misrepresented, leading to the reliance on information from the wrong source or the loss of information through incorrect assignment. As Hollingshead notes, “information may be transferred or explicitly delegated to the ‘wrong’ individual in the system, e. g., one {{who does not have}} responsibility for that type of information or is unlikely to remember it {{due to a lack of}} expertise”. While researchers recognize the likelihood of such behavioral errors, little research has examined their potential impact in teams. The current study, therefore, focuses on the effects of errors in transactive memory behavior on the emergence of team cognitive structures and resultant performance in the initial stage of team interaction. To develop our hypotheses, we first discuss the types of behaviors involved in the development and operation of transactive memory systems, identify where errors may arise, and discuss their effects on team performance. Then, we attempt to uncover the cognitive processes underlying those effects. More specifically, we introduce mental model accuracy and transactive memory cognitions and suggest that each mediates the negative relationship between errors in transactive memory behavior and team performance. While the possible risks of faulty transactive memory system development have been acknowledged in prior research, it has also been suggested that transactive memory errors can be easily corrected and their effects on performance subsequently minimized. The current study challenges this assumption and in doing so advances our understanding of not only the relationship between errors in transactive memory behavior and team performance but also the mechanisms that might help explain this relationship...|$|E
