40|$|Background: Population-based {{self-reported}} data on <b>off-label</b> <b>medicine</b> use {{independent from}} health care provisions are lacking. The {{purpose of this}} study is to investigate <b>off-label</b> <b>medicine</b> use in children and adolescents in Germany in a non-clinical setting and to identify prevalence, determinants and spectrum of <b>off-label</b> <b>medicine</b> use. Methods: Data were obtained from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) conducted by the Robert Koch Institute (2003 – 2006). 17, 450 randomly selected children aged 0 – 17 years took part in the drug interviews. Of those, 8, 899 took at least one medicine during the 7 days preceding the interview. <b>Off-label</b> <b>medicine</b> use was defined as the discrepancy between actual use and the intended use described in the summary of product characteristics. <b>Off-label</b> <b>medicine</b> use was stratified into off-label indication, off-label age, off-label over-dosing, and off-label under-dosing. Results: The prevalence rate of <b>off-label</b> <b>medicine</b> use among those who used medicines amount of is 40. 2 %. The prevalence rate is significantly higher in boys (41. 4 %), in children aged 3 to 6 years (48. 7 %), without migration background (40. 9 %), with high social status (42. 5 %), living in small (42. 0 %) and medium sized cities (41. 6 %), and with a poor parents rated health status (41. 7 %). 12, 667 preparations (attributable in respect to off-label use) were taken by 8, 899 children. 30 % of the medicines have been used off-label. <b>Off-label</b> <b>medicine</b> use was highest in preparations of the ATC-class “C 00 Cardiovascular System”. In all origins of medicine, all age groups and all ATC-classes under-dosing was the most frequent reason for <b>off-label</b> <b>medicine</b> use. Conclusions: There is a considerable level of self-reported off-label medicines use in the general paediatric population. Further investigations are needed to examine in how far <b>off-label</b> <b>medicine</b> use is based on lack of knowledge or on empiricism in paediatric pharmacotherapy. Attention also needs to be paid to under-dosing which potentially exposes drug users to risks of side effects without the benefit of a therapeutic effect. Clinical trials for licensing of paediatric medicines, education of health care professionals, but also of parents and carers are needed to ensure the rational use of medicines...|$|E

40|$|Objective To assess current {{experiences}} {{and attitudes of}} hospital based paediatricians towards <b>off-label</b> <b>medicine</b> prescribing. Setting Paediatric hospital wards and out-patient clinics. Design A prospective, questionnaire based study. Results A 30 item questionnaire was sent to 300 hospital based paediatricians and 250 (83 %) were returned completed. Over 69 % of responders {{were familiar with the}} term off-label medicines. However, only 28 % were knowingly prescribing off-label medicines to children. The majority of respondents (90 %) expressed concerns about the safety and efficacy of off-label medicines. Only 15 % had observed Adverse Drug Reactions, and 31 % a treatment failure. The vast majority of respondents (83 %) did not obtain informed consent or tell parents they were prescribing off label medicines to their children. Conclusions Off-label prescribing of medicines to children is a familiar concept to the majority of paediatricians in Jordan although only a smaller number are aware that it is common in their practice. Respondents showed concern about off label prescribing, although the majority do not consider it necessary to inform parents.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The amended Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act {{requires}} efficacy certification for a drug’s initial uses (“on-label”), {{but does}} not require certification before physicians may prescribe the drug for subsequent uses (“off-label”). Does {{it make sense to}} require FDA efficacy certification for new drugs but not for new uses of old drugs? Using a sequential online survey, we carried on a “virtual conversation” with some 500 physicians. The survey asked whether efficacy requirements should be imposed on off-label uses; almost all physicians said no. It asked whether the efficacy requirements for initial uses should be dropped, and most physicians said no. We then asked respondents whether opposing efficacy requirements in one case but not the other involved an inconsistency. In response, we received hundreds of written commentaries.

40|$|Masters of ScienceProblem and significance: Off-label use of {{medicines}} is not illegal; however, {{it can be}} risky and harmful, or beneficial and innovative. The main problem of this practice {{is the lack of}} systems for monitoring adverse drug reactions, since the drugs are used {{in a manner that is}} not approved by regulatory agencies. For this reason public health protection is not guaranteed. Purpose: To identify the various systems employed in different regions to monitor/manage the risks and benefits of off-label use; and to ascertain their extent of implementation. Method/search strategy: Electronic and manual literature search was done. Articles referring to <b>off-label</b> <b>medicine</b> use were reviewed. The literature included journal articles, national MRA guidelines, international guidelines, etc. The articles were sourced from databases such as Pubmed and Google Scholar. Data was collected from both developed and emerging markets. There was no limit to publication date. Findings: Pharmacovigilance systems for off-label use do exist although the degree of commitment and advancement differs per country. Explicit off-label laws are present in the developed countries but not in the developing ones. Implications of findings: Stakeholder involvement is very important in monitoring off-label use. Reporting of ADRs can be improved by asserting the role of off-label PV in drug repositioning. The regulator is under pressure to maintain public trust through efficient control of off-label use...|$|E
40|$|Background. In {{the absence}} of {{standard}} pediatric prescribing information, clinicians often use <b>medicines</b> in an <b>off-label</b> way. Many studies have been published across the globe reporting different rates of off-label use. There is currently no study based on Indian drug formulary. Methods. The prospective observational study included pediatric patients in ages between 0 and 12 years admitted in a tertiary care hospital. Off-label use was assessed using the National Formulary of India (NFI). Predictors of off-label use were determined by logistic regression. Results. Of the 1645 medications prescribed, 1152 (70 %) were off-label based on 14 possible <b>off-label</b> categories. <b>Off-label</b> <b>medicines</b> were mainly due to dose difference and use in restricted age limits as indicated in NFI. Respiratory medicines (82 %), anti-infectives (73 %), and nervous system medicines (53 %) had higher off-label use. Important predictors of off-label prescribing were pediatric patients in age of 0 to 2 years (OR 1. 68, 95 % CI; P< 0. 001) and hospital stay of six to 10 days (OR 1. 91, 95 % CI; P< 0. 001). Conclusion. Off-label prescribing is common among pediatric patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{medicines}} used in newborns, infants, {{children and}} adolescents are not licensed ("unlicensed") or are prescribed outside {{the terms of the}} marketing authorization ("off-label"). Several studies have shown that this is a common practice in various healthcare settings in the USA, Europe and Australia, but data are scarce in Switzerland. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our prospective {{study was to determine the}} proportion of unlicensed or off-label prescriptions in paediatric patients. METHODS: This pilot study was conducted prospectively over a six month period in the department of paediatrics of a university hospital. RESULTS: Sixty patients aged from three days to 14 years were included in the study. A total of 483 prescriptions were written for the patients. More than half of all prescriptions (247; 51 %) followed the terms of the marketing authorization. 114 (24 %) were unlicensed and 122 (25 %) off-label. All patients received at least one unlicensed or offlabel medicine. CONCLUSION: The use of unlicensed or <b>off-label</b> <b>medicines</b> to treat children was found to be common. Co-operation between the pharmaceutical industry, national regulatory authorities, clinical researchers, healthcare professionals and parents is required in order to ensure that children do not remain "therapeutic orphans"...|$|R

40|$|Background and aims: Prescribing {{medicines}} in an off-label manner {{for children}} with chronic conditions is sparsely documented, even more so among developing countries. This needs addressing. The objective {{was to investigate the}} extent of this prescribing among children with epilepsy, asthma, and sickle cell anaemia in Nigeria. Methods: Prescriptions for children ≤ 16 years documented in their case files that attended paediatric clinics in Lagos, Nigeria, for these three conditions between January and October 2015, were reviewed retrospectively to extract data on the medicines prescribed. British National Formulary for children and American Hospital Formulary Service Drug information were used as references. Results: 477 patients received 1746 prescriptions. Off-label prescriptions were seen in 7. 7 % of prescriptions, related to dose (93; 68. 9 %), indication (22; 16. 3 %), and age (20; 14. 8 %). Nervous system (525; 30. 1 %) and anti-infective (441; 25. 2 %) medicines were the most prescribed but only 9. 5 % and 8. 2 % of the respective prescriptions were off-label. Children with epilepsy received the most number (94; 69. 6 %) of off-label prescriptions. The three chronic conditions did not associate significantly with the category of <b>off-label</b> <b>medicine</b> prescribed (p= 0. 925).

40|$|Background The drug {{licensing}} {{regulatory system}} ensures that marketed drugs to be used, meet the high standards and requirements for quality, efficacy and safety. Unfortunately, in practice, prescribers are often obliged {{to deviate from}} granted medicine marketing authorisation, {{due to the lack}} of availability of appropriate medicines for patient’s therapeutic needs and progress. This concept of medicines use not mentioned in the approved labelling (FDA Modernization Act) or outside of the terms of Summary of Product Characteristics regarding indication, age, dosage, pharmaceutical form and route of administration (British NHS Guideline) is defined as off-label use of licensed medicines. On the global level, many supportive evidence and health care needs confirm that off-label medicines use occurs in every country and each level or specialty area of healthcare (Conroy, 2003). Moreover, it is an integral part of Good Medical Practice and may provide the best available option or even the standard of care in a particular health condition (Dresser and Frader, 2009). In general, this concept is legal and may be appropriate, but it can be associated with safety, clinical and ethical concerns, emphasizing the increased incidence of adverse events associated with off-label medicines uses in particularly vulnerable patient groups (Gazarian and Kelly, 2006). A concerning issue is that the majority of all off-label uses have limited to no scientific support (Radley et al., 2006) and a considerable number of prescribers have no or limited knowledge about <b>off-label</b> <b>medicine</b> use or do not meet regulations regarding off-label use, if they exist. (Piñeiro Pérez et al., 2014). Experience shows that to ensure the quality of off-label use of medicines, there should be a formal mechanism to assess the feasibility, monitoring the safety and efficiency of medication used based on this concept. Thus, in continuum, the off-label use of medicines has been an essential part of the ethical and legal considerations as well as, many regulatory initiatives. The overall objective is to present a model regulatory framework setting out guidelines and recommendations for quality use of off-label medicines within the national profile of health care policy. A literature search was undertaken to identify the issues and challenges related to off-label medicines use including clinical, safety and ethical concerns. Recommendations for model framework Principles of good practice for off-label use of medicines should include the following elements: identifying the medical needs; compilation of a consensus list of accepted, scientific based off-label uses; creating an official expert group for the evaluation and approval of specific offlabel uses; and, providing a safe and effective supply. The main guiding principles and developed activities to support a responsible decision-making with regard to off-label medicines include: 1) the medical need- the best avail- S 7 OP 290 608 Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 607 - 608 (2016) Oral presentations Continuing professional development able treatment in cases of specific characteristics when authorized medicines cannot meet the patients’ need; 2) sufficient scientific basis and/or clinical practice experience to justify their action. Distinguish the routine off-label use, which is the use of these medicines based on “high quality” evidence and the use in specific exceptional circumstances; 3) information duty and a high degree of respect for patient rights, involving the patient/carer in decisionmaking process; 4) monitoring and reporting the outcomes, efficiency and adverse reactions; 5) considering self-monitoring of prescribing practices, liability and accountability. An additional special responsibility which among others falls on pharmacists should be to ensure that the prescriber is conscious for off-label prescribing and the reasons for that 6) production of compendia of certain medicines, enlisting those off-label uses judged to be legitimate. 7) financial sustainability of an off-label use in medical practice. Before deciding to compound a patient-specific preparation, a step by step evaluation of alternatives should be made. These alternatives include a therapeutic alternative, dose rounding or manipulation of licensed dosage forms (splitting tablets, crushing tablets/opening capsules, dispersing their content in water or food, splitting suppositories, the use of a preparation designed for another route of administration). Conclusion Prescription, compounding, dispensing and administration of off label use of medicines should be regulated within the national profile of health care policy. The regulation regarding the practice of <b>off-label</b> <b>medicine</b> use differs between countries. Some countries have this practice regulated by law, while in others it is covered by good practice regulations or general professional recommendations and ethical standards. Assuming that there is no any general rule to regulate the “accurate” offlabel use of medicines it is of paramount importance for the countries to find a national solution to fulfil the ethical and legal demand, especially in the areas of pharmaceutical law and health insurance law. The common elements of these regulatory frameworks are the physicians’ freedom to prescribe off-label medicines if the scientific evidence exists and the need to inform patients when making this decision. Making policy efforts, by adopting appropriate guidelines for off-label medicines use, based on scientific evidence, with specifications of healthcare professionals’ responsibilities and a registry of off-label drug use in every day practice, would make possible a valuable approach towards ensuring a quality use of these medicines. Recommended solutions, as practiced in some countries, would support prescribes in more direct and active approach to handle the ethical and legal phenomenon associated with the off-label use of medicines...|$|E

However, they also concur that potential inappropriate promotion, as well as possibly dangerous prescribing practices for these drugs, should be prevented.

40|$|Abstract Background The lack of {{availability}} of appropriate medicines for children is an extensive and well known problem. Paediatricians and Physicians who {{take care of}} the paediatric population are primarily exposed to cope with this negative situation very often as {{more than half of the}} children are prescribed <b>off-label</b> or unlicensed <b>medicines.</b> Discussion Medicinal products used to treat this population should be subjected to ethical research of high quality and be explicitly authorised for use in children as it happens in adults. For that reason, and following the US experience, the European Paediatric Regulation has been amended in January 2007 by the European Commission. The objective of the Paediatric Regulation is to improve the development of high quality and ethically researched medicines for children aged 0 to 17 years, to facilitate the {{availability of}} information on the use of medicines for children, without subjecting children to unnecessary trials, or delaying the authorisation of medicines for use in adults. Summary The Paediatric Regulation is dramatically changing the regulatory environment for paediatric medicines in Europe and is fuelling an increased number of clinical trials in the paediatric population. Nevertheless, there are some risks and pitfalls that need to be anticipated and controlled in order to ensure that children will ultimately benefit from this European initiative. </p...|$|R
40|$|European Union (EU) {{legislation}} on marketing authorisation of medicinal products aims to safeguard {{public health and}} to protect the free movement of these products. As part of this authorisation, the terms under which a product can be used safely and effectively are described in the product information.

After a literature review on the current status of unlicensed/off-label definitions, a two-stage, web-based Delphi survey was conducted among experts in Europe. Their opinion on concerns, rules and scenarios regarding the unlicensed and <b>off-label</b> use of <b>medicines</b> were obtained. Results were then consulted with the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) before the final proposal was circulated to participants. Eighty-four experts were invited to participate (scientists, health professionals, pharmaceutical companies, regulatory agencies), 34 responded to the first round questionnaire and participated in subsequent rounds. Consensus was reached for the majority of questions. The lowest level of consensus reached was for questions related to a different formulation or if a drug was given although contraindicated. At the final step, 85 % of the responding experts agreed on the proposed definition for off-label (use of a drug already covered by a Marketing Authorisation, in an unapproved way) and 80 % on the definition for unlicensed (use of a drug not covered by a Marketing Authorisation as medicinal for human use), respectively. Results will facilitate the conduct of pharmacoepidemiological studies and allow comparison between different countries. The Delphi panel agreed that the definitions should be circulated within the scientific community and recommended to be adopted by relevant regulatory authorities. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{majority}} of drugs prescribed {{have not been}} tested in children and safety and efficacy of children's medicines are frequently supported by low quality of evidence. Therefore, {{a large percentage of}} prescriptions for children in the clinical daily practice are used off label. Despite the several recent legislation and regulatory efforts performed worldwide, they have not been successful in increasing availability of medicines adapted to children. Moreover, if we consider that 30 % of the prescribed drugs for children are for the respiratory field and only 4 % of new investigation projects for children research were proposed to access drugs for respiratory and allergy treatment, there is a clear imbalance of the children needs in this therapeutic area. This narrative review aimed to describe and discuss the <b>off-label</b> use of <b>medicines</b> in the treatment and control of respiratory and allergic diseases in children. It was recognized that a large percentage of prescriptions performed for allergy treatment in daily clinical practice are off label. The clinicians struggle on a daily basis with the responsibility to balance risk-benefits of an off-label prescription while involving the patients and their families in this decision. It is crucial to increase awareness of this reality not only for the clinician, but also to the global organizations and competent authorities. New measures for surveillance of off-label use should be established, namely through population databases implementation. There is a need for new proposal to correct the inconsistency between the priorities for pediatric drug research, frequently dependent on commercial motivations, in order to comply to the true needs of the children, especially on the respiratory and allergy fields...|$|R
40|$|Health systems {{need to set}} {{priorities}} fairly. In one way or another, part of {{this important}} task will fall to physicians. How do they make judgments about resource stewardship, and how should they do so? How can they make such decisions {{in a manner that}} is compatible with their clinical duties to patients? In this book, philosophers, bioethicists, physicians, lawyers and health policy experts make the case that priority setting and rationing contribute significantly to the possibility of affordable and fair healthcare and that clinicians play an indispensable role in that process. The book depicts the results of a survey of European physicians about their experiences with rationing and other cost containment strategies, and their perception of scarcity and fairness in their health care systems. Responding to and complementing these findings, commentators discuss why resource allocation and bedside rationing is necessary and justifiable. The book explores how bedside rationing relates to clinical judgments about medical necessity and medical indications, marginal benefits, weak evidence based <b>medicine,</b> <b>off-label</b> use. The book highlights how comparative studies of health care systems can advance more effective and fair bedside rationing through learning from one another. From a practical standpoint, the book offers a number of strategies for health care systems and clinicians to work in tandem to allocate and ration resources as fairly as possible: how to foster more attention to fairness when rationing at the bedside, how to avoid exacerbating health disparities when allocating resources, how to teach about bedside rationing to students, how to discuss rationing more explicitly in the public arena and in the doctor's office.

40|$|Political background: As a German novelty, the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen; IGWiG) was {{established}} in 2004 to, among other tasks, evaluate the benefit of pharmaceuticals. In this context it is of importance that patented pharmaceuticals are only excluded from the reference pricing system if they offer a therapeutic improvement. The institute is commissioned by the Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, G-BA) or by the Ministry of Health and Social Security. The German policy objective expressed by the latest health care reform (Gesetz zur Modernisierung der Gesetzlichen Krankenversicherung, GMG) is to base decisions on a scientific assessment of pharmaceuticals in comparison to already available treatments. However, procedures and methods are still to be established. Research questions and methods: This health technology assessment (HTA) report was commissioned by the German Agency for HTA at the Institute for Medical Documentation and Information (DAHTA@DIMDI). It analysed criteria, procedures, and methods of comparative drug assessment in other EU-/OECD-countries. The research question was the following: How do national public institutions compare medicines in connection with pharmaceutical regulation, i. e. licensing, reimbursement and pricing of drugs? Institutions as well as documents concerning comparative drug evaluation (e. g. regulations, guidelines) were identified through internet, systematic literature, and hand searches. Publications were selected according to pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Documents were analysed in a qualitative matter following an analytic framework that had been developed in advance. Results were summarised narratively and presented in evidence tables. Results and discussion: Currently licensing agencies do not systematically assess a new drug's added value for patients and society. This is why many countries made post-licensing evaluation of pharmaceuticals a requirement for reimbursement or pricing decisions. Typically an explicitly designated drug review body is involved. In all eleven countries included (Austria, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) a drug's therapeutic benefit in comparison to treatment alternatives is leading the evaluation. A medicine is classified as a therapeutic improvement if it demonstrates an improved benefit-/risk-profile compared to treatment alternatives. However, evidence of superiority to a relevant degree is requested. Health related {{quality of life is}} considered as the most appropriate criterion for a drug's added value from patients' perspective. Review bodies in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom have committed themselves to include this outcome measure whenever possible. Pharmacological or innovative characteristics (e. g. administration route, dosage regime, new acting principle) and other advantages (e. g. taste, appearance) are considered in about half of the countries. However, in most cases these aspects rank as second line criteria for a drug's added value. All countries except France and Switzerland perform a comparative pharmacoeconomic evaluation to analyse costs caused by a drug intervention in relation to its benefit (preferably by cost utility analysis). However, the question if a medicine is cost effective in relation to treatment alternatives is answered in a political and social context. A range of remarkably varying criteria are considered. Countries agree that randomised controlled head-to-head trials (head-to-head RCT) {{with a high degree of}} internal and external validity provide the most reliable and least biased evidence of a drug's relative treatment effects (as do systematic reviews and meta-analyses of these RCT). Final outcome parameters reflecting long-term treatment objectives (mortality, morbidity, quality of life) are preferred to surrogate parameters. Following the concept of community effectiveness, drug review institutions also explicitly favour RCT in a "natural" design, i. e. in daily routine and country specific care settings. The countries' requirements for pharmacoeconomic studies are similar despite some methodological inconsistencies, e. g. concerning cost calculation. Outcomes of clinical and pharmacoeconomic analyses are largely determined by the choice of comparator. Selecting an appropriate comparative treatment is therefore crucial. In theory, the best or most cost effective therapy is regarded as appropriate comparator for clinical and economic studies. Pragmatically however, institutions accept that the drug is compared to the treatment of daily routine or to the least expensive therapy. If a pharmaceutical offers several approved indications, in some countries all of them are assessed. Others only evaluate a drug's main indication. Canada is the only country which also considers a <b>medicine's</b> <b>off-label</b> use. It is well known that clinical trials and pharmacoeconomic studies directly comparing a drug with adequate competitors are lacking - in quantitative as well as in qualitative terms. This is specifically the case before or shortly after marketing authorisation. Yet there is the need to support reimbursement or pricing decisions by scientific evidence. In this situation review bodies are often forced to rely on observational studies or on other internally less valid data (including expert and consensus opinions). As a second option they use statistical approaches like indirect adjusted comparisons (in Australia and the United Kingdom) and, commonly, economic modelling. However, there is consensus that results provided by these techniques need to be verified by valid head-to-head comparisons as soon as possible. ConclusionsIn the majority of countries reimbursement and pricing decisions are based on systematic and evidence-based evaluation comparing a drug's clinical and economic characteristics to daily treatment routine. However, further evaluation criteria, requirements and specific methodological issues still lack internationally consented standards...|$|R
