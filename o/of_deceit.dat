The circumstances surrounding the deal (as of November 2007) are still unclear: Divac claims that he indeed loaned some money to the Đorđević's Si company, which was in financial troubles, and after Đorđević failed to fulfill his part of the deal, just used the contract, already properly signed by Đorđević, to claim ownership of the company.|$|E

40|$|The Country Wife, {{one of the}} wittiest {{plays of}} the Restoration, belongs to the genre of the comedy of manners, staging a cynical and immoral society. Possibly a {{realistic}} portrait of the contemporary London world, it shows a well constructed series <b>of</b> <b>deceits,</b> disguises and frauds, which only the main character, the wit, can control through humour, libertinism, and a smart use of words. Though different plots are interwoven, the main opposition is between the artificiality of society and the naiveté <b>of</b> “nature”. <b>Deceit</b> arises from the ambiguities of gesture and language, consciously used as weapons against dupes and enemies. A perfect theatrical device, the comedy is essentially based on bright and witty conversation. The volume contains the Italian translation of Wycherley’s play, edited with footnotes, biographical and bibliographical notes and an introduction...|$|R

25|$|The {{point about}} {{remoteness}} of damages under s 2(1) was {{treated in the}} controversial case of Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson. Here Mr Rogerson bought a car on hire purchase, from a Honda dealer, financed by Royscot Trust Ltd. When Mr Rogerson fell behind in his repayments and sold away the car, Royscot Trust Ltd sued the Honda dealer, because they found it had misrepresented {{the proportion of the}} deposit Mr Rogerson had put down for the car. On this basis they argued that Honda was liable for them not being able to recover the cost of the loan (Mr Rogerson had no money). Royscot Ltd argued that the loss was too remote, or that Mr Rogerson's wrongful sale was a break in the causal chain. But the Court of Appeal held that in any event the test under s 2(1) was the same as in the tort <b>of</b> <b>deceit,</b> that one should be liable for all consequences. Balcombe LJ said this followed from the clear wording of the Act.|$|E
25|$|Statements of fact in a {{contract}} or in obtaining the contract {{are considered to}} be either warranties or representations. Traditionally, warranties are factual promises which are enforced through {{a contract}} legal action, regardless of materiality, intent, or reliance. Representations are traditionally precontractual statements which allow for a tort-based action (such as the tort <b>of</b> <b>deceit)</b> if the misrepresentation is negligent or fraudulent; historically a tort was the only action available, but by 1778, breach of warranty became a separate legal contractual action. In U.S. law, the distinction between the two is somewhat unclear; warranties are viewed as primarily contract-based legal action while negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations are tort-based, but there is a confusing mix of case law in the United States. In modern English law, sellers often avoid using the term 'represents' in order to avoid claims under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, while in America 'warrants and represents' is relatively common. Some modern commentators suggest avoiding the words and substituting 'state' or 'agree', and some model forms do not use the words; however, others disagree.|$|E
25|$|In 1524 conquistador Pedro de Alvarado {{arrived in}} Guatemala with 135 horsemen, 120 footsoldiers and 400 Aztec, Tlaxcaltecs and Cholultec allies. They were quickly promised {{military}} assistance by the Kaqchikels. The K'iche {{knew all about}} {{the movements of the}} Spanish forces through their network of spies. When the army arrived at the K'iche' town of Xelajú Noj (Quetzaltenango) the K'iche' steward of the town sent word to Q'umarkaj. The K'iche' chose Tecún Umán, a lord from Totonicapán, as their commander against the Spanish, and he was ritually prepared for the battle. He and his 8,400 warriors met the Spanish/Aztec/Kaqchikel army outside of Pinal south of Quetzalteango and were defeated. After several more defeats the K'iche' offered the Spanish vassalage and invited them to Q'umarkaj. By way <b>of</b> <b>deceit</b> Alvarado then seized the lords of Q'umarkaj and burned them alive. He instated two lower K'iche leaders as his puppet rulers and continued to subdue the other K'iche' communities in the area. Q'umarkaj was razed and levelled to hinder the K'iche' in reestablishing themselves at the well-fortified site, and the community relocated to the nearby town of Santa Cruz del Quiché.|$|E

25|$|The action {{begins when}} a Yugoslav {{military}} attaché defects in Ottawa and is assassinated before the Canadians can interrogate him. In Trieste, {{at the same}} time, someone has begun eliminating NATO agents. Higgins, their case officer, is warned by Avadek {{that he has a}} traitor in his network. Suddenly, he's running for his life, framed for the murder of one of his contacts. Pursued by an unknown enemy, he falls in love with Fae, whose violent past figures in their search for answers. Meanwhile, Vitali Alferyev, KGB station chief in Belgrade, has been recalled to Moscow, where his superior orders him to withdraw all covert operatives from the sector between Rijeka and Ljubljana. Alferyev’s search for the reason leads him into a deadly conflict with a GRU agent operating in the area. The novel reaches its climax in the Yugoslav mountains, where Croatian terrorists, KGB spies, and NATO agents play out the final violent moves in a dangerous game to change the fate of Europe. Higgins and Avadek must sift through layers <b>of</b> <b>deceit</b> and treachery in their attempt to thwart an enemy whose tentacles stretch from the East to the West and from the past to the (novel’s) present.|$|E

Whiteley observed that in the video, Madonna's lover wears the lion's mask and while cavorting with him, Madonna sheds the veneer of innocence and shows her propensity for wild animal passions. Having instilled desire, metaphorically she turns her lover into a Beast. Madonna commented about shooting with the lion: ...|$|E
