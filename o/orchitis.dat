5|$|Completing {{his course}} at Upavon, McNamara was posted back to Egypt in August, but was hospitalised on 8 September with <b>orchitis.</b> Discharged on 6 October, he served briefly as a flying {{instructor}} with No.22 Squadron RFC, {{before returning to}} No.1 Squadron. McNamara flew with CFlight, commanded by Captain (later Air Marshal Sir) Richard Williams. On his first sortie, a reconnaissance mission over Sinai, McNamara was unaware that his plane {{had been hit by}} anti-aircraft fire; he returned to base with his engine's oil supply almost exhausted. Flying B.E.2s and Martinsydes, he undertook further scouting and bombing missions in the ensuing months.|$|E
25|$|Brucellosis is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} bacterial disease {{that can cause}} uveitis, abortion, and <b>orchitis</b> in dogs.|$|E
25|$|Injection {{of sperm}} antigens causes {{inflammation}} of the testis (auto-immune <b>orchitis)</b> and reduced fertility. Thus, the blood–testis barrier may reduce the likelihood that sperm proteins will induce an immune response, reducing fertility and so progeny.|$|E
25|$|Examples of MAIS phenotypes include {{isolated}} infertility (oligospermia or azoospermia), mild gynecomastia {{in young}} adulthood, decreased secondary terminal hair, high pitched voice, or minor hypospadias repair in childhood. The external male genitalia (penis, scrotum, and urethra) are otherwise normal in individuals with MAIS. Internal genitalia, including Wolffian structures (the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles) and the prostate, is also normal, although the bitesticular volume of infertile men (both {{with and without}} MAIS) is diminished; male infertility is associated with reduced bitesticular volume, varicocele, retractile testes, low ejaculate volume, male accessory gland infections (MAGI), and mumps <b>orchitis.</b> The incidence of these features in infertile men with MAIS {{is similar to that}} of infertile men without MAIS. MAIS is not associated with Müllerian remnants.|$|E
2500|$|Mumps {{is another}} viral disease of {{childhood}} {{that was once}} very common. [...] If mumps is acquired by a male who is past puberty, a possible complication is bilateral <b>orchitis</b> which can in some cases lead to sterility.|$|E
2500|$|Brucellosis in dogs {{is caused}} by Brucella canis. [...] It is a sexually {{transmitted}} disease, but can also be spread through contact with aborted fetuses. [...] The most common sign is abortion during the last trimester or stillbirth. [...] Other symptoms include inflammation of the intervertebral disc and eye (uveitis), and inflammation of the testicle (<b>orchitis)</b> and prostate (prostatitis) in males.|$|E
2500|$|Painful {{testicular}} inflammation {{develops in}} 15–40 {{percent of men}} who have completed puberty and contract the mumps virus. This testicular inflammation is generally one-sided (both testicles are swollen in 15–30 percent of mumps <b>orchitis</b> cases) and typically occurs about 10 days after the parotid gland inflamed. Testicular swelling has been documented as late as six weeks after parotid gland swelling. [...] Decreased fertility is an uncommon consequence of testicular inflammation from mumps and infertility is rare.|$|E
2500|$|A {{major risk}} factor for the {{development}} of testis cancer is cryptorchidism (undescended testicles). [...] It is generally believed that the presence of a tumor contributes to cryptorchidism; [...] when cryptorchidism occurs in conjunction with a tumor then the tumor tends to be large. [...] Other risk factors include inguinal hernias, Klinefelter syndrome, and mumps <b>orchitis.</b> [...] Physical activity is associated with decreased risk and sedentary lifestyle is associated with increased risk. Early onset of male characteristics is associated with increased risk. [...] These may reflect endogenous or environmental hormones.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orchitis</b> is a {{condition}} of testicular pain involving swelling, inflammation and possibly infection. <b>Orchitis</b> {{can be caused by}} an autoimmune reaction (autoimmune <b>orchitis)</b> leading to a reduction in fertility. Autoimmune <b>orchitis</b> is rare in humans, compared to anti-sperm antibodies. To study <b>orchitis</b> in the testis, autoimmune <b>orchitis</b> has been induced in the rodent testis. The disease starts with the appearance of testicular antibodies, then movement of macrophages and lymphocytes from the blood stream into the testis, breaking of the physical interactions between the developing sperm and Sertoli cells, entry of neutrophils or eosinophils, and finally death of the developing sperm, leading to infertility.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Orchitis</b> can {{be related}} to {{epididymitis}} infection that has spread to the testicles (then called [...] "epididymo-orchitis"), sometimes caused by the sexually transmitted diseases chlamydia and gonorrhea. It has also been reported in cases of males infected with brucellosis. <b>Orchitis</b> can also be seen during active mumps, particularly in adolescent boys.|$|E

50|$|A male genital {{disease is}} a {{condition}} that affects the male reproductive system. An example is <b>orchitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{inflammation}} of the epididymis is called epididymitis. It is much more common than testicular inflammation, termed <b>orchitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Swine also develop <b>orchitis</b> (swelling of the testicles), {{lameness}} (movement disability), {{hind limb}} paralysis, or spondylitis (inflammation in joints).|$|E
50|$|Ischemic <b>orchitis</b> {{may result}} from damage to the blood vessels of the spermatic cord during {{inguinal}} herniorrhaphy, and may in the worst event lead to testicular atrophy.|$|E
5000|$|Dendritic cells {{initiate}} adaptive immune responses. Relatively {{small amounts}} of dendritic cells {{have been found in}} the testes of humans, rats [...] and mice. The functional role of dendritic cells in the testis is not well understood, although they {{have been shown to be}} involved in autoimmune <b>orchitis</b> during animal experiments. When autoimmune <b>orchitis</b> is induced in rats, the dendritic cell population of the testis greatly increases. This is likely to contribute to testicular inflammation, considering the well-established role of dendritic cells in other types of autoimmune inflammation.|$|E
50|$|The history {{should include}} prior {{testicular}} or penile insults (torsion, cryptorchidism, trauma), infections (mumps <b>orchitis,</b> epididymitis), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation, medications, {{and drug use}} (anabolic steroids, alcohol, smoking).|$|E
50|$|Gonadal {{defects and}} {{diseases}} e.g. Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Testicular failure due to mumps <b>orchitis,</b> Coxsackievirus B, irradiation, chemotherapy, or trauma. Testicular failure is treated with testosterone replacement, Ovarian failure.|$|E
50|$|Up to 20% {{of cases}} can have {{genitourinary}} involvement; <b>orchitis</b> and epididymitis are most common. Neurological symptoms include depression and mental fatigue. Cardiovascular involvement can include endocarditis resulting in death.|$|E
50|$|Injection {{of sperm}} antigens causes {{inflammation}} of the testis (auto-immune <b>orchitis)</b> and reduced fertility. Thus, the blood-testis barrier may reduce the likelihood that sperm proteins will induce an immune response, reducing fertility and so progeny.|$|E
5000|$|Nonneurologic {{complications}} of WNV infection that may rarely occur include fulminant hepatitis, pancreatitis, myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, <b>orchitis,</b> nephritis, optic neuritis and cardiac dysrhythmias and hemorrhagic fever with coagulopathy.

50|$|Acquired causes (due {{to damage}} to or {{dysfunction}} of the gonads) include ovarian torsion, vanishing/anorchia, <b>orchitis,</b> premature ovarian failure, ovarian resistance syndrome, trauma, surgery, autoimmunity, chemotherapy, radiation, infections (e.g., sexually-transmitted diseases), toxins (e.g., endocrine disruptors), and drugs (e.g., antiandrogens, opioids, alcohol).|$|E
50|$|Sperm are {{protected}} from autoimmune attack, which when {{it occurs in}} humans leads to infertility. Local injury of seminiferous tubules caused by fine-needle biopsies in humans does not cause testicular inflammation (<b>orchitis).</b> Furthermore, human testis cells tolerate early HIV infection with little response.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Orchitis</b> [...] or orchiditis [...] (from the Ancient Greek [...] meaning [...] "testicle"; same root as orchid) is {{inflammation}} of the testes. It can also involve swelling, heavy pains and frequent infection, and is more rarely known as didymitis (as in epididymis).|$|E
50|$|Studies in mice {{have shown}} other {{adverse health effects}} due to DEHP exposure. Ingestion of 0.01% DEHP caused damage to the blood-testis barrier as well as {{induction}} of experimental autoimmune <b>orchitis.</b> There is also a correlation between DEHP plasma levels in women and endometriosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{bacterium}} causes severe {{inflammation of}} the epididymis, with formation of spermatocoeles and fibrinous adhesions. This disease is known as ovine brucellosis, and is a reportable disease in the USA. It can also cause epididymitis in cattle, and reproductive disease such as <b>orchitis,</b> mastitis, and abortions.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of swollen inguinal lymph nodes {{is an important}} clinical sign because lymphadenopathy (swelling) may indicate an infection (such as <b>orchitis</b> in males) in the lower extremities or spread from cancers, such as anal cancer and vulvar cancer. Inguinal lymph nodes may normally be up to 2 cm.|$|E
50|$|Brucellosis in dogs {{is caused}} by Brucella canis. It is a sexually {{transmitted}} disease, but can also be spread through contact with aborted fetuses. The most common sign is abortion during the last trimester or stillbirth. Other symptoms include inflammation of the intervertebral disc and eye (uveitis), and inflammation of the testicle (<b>orchitis)</b> and prostate (prostatitis) in males.|$|E
50|$|In {{most cases}} where <b>orchitis</b> {{is caused by}} epididymitis, {{treatment}} is an oral antibiotic such as cefalexin or ciprofloxacin until infection clears up. In both causes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen or ibuprofen are recommended to relieve pain. Sometimes stronger pain medications in the opiate category are called for and are frequently prescribed by experienced emergency room physicians.|$|E
50|$|Prognosis is {{generally}} poor. If a patient survives, recovery may be prompt and complete, or protracted with sequelae, such as <b>orchitis,</b> hepatitis, uveitis, parotitis, desquamation or alopecia. Importantly, MARV {{is known to}} be able to persist in some survivors and to either reactivate and cause a secondary bout of MVD or to be transmitted via sperm, causing secondary cases of infection and disease.|$|E
