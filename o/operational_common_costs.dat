40|$|Negative {{externalities}} or 'congestion'costs in {{the utilization}} of common resources introduce strategic considerations that tie cost allocation rules to competitiveness in external markets. The equilibrium rule for allocating <b>common</b> <b>costs</b> consists of 'profitability'and 'strategic' components. The profitability component dictates that the share of <b>common</b> <b>costs</b> imposed on a product should be inversely related to its relative profitability vis-a-vis other products. The strategic component dictates that the share of <b>common</b> <b>costs</b> should be modified to favor products sold in markets where strategic considerations are of relatively greater importance (i. e., oligopolistic vis-a-vis perfectly competitive markets).

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the thoughts of an Italian academic who lived {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century, Lorenzo De Minico, in particular it regards his approach to the allocation of <b>common</b> <b>costs.</b> De Minico's main concern was with the conventional, subjective allocation methods proposed by Italian practitioners and academics of his time. He valiantly searched for a methodological approach based on using causality as the basis for linking costs to cost objects. The most interesting finding of De Minico was the concept of ‘flows of services’ and his commitment to offering a convincing answer to the problem of general or <b>common</b> <b>cost</b> apportionment that went beyond ‘traditional’ criteria. De Minico's ‘flows of services’ referred to the outputs of resources consumed in indirect services. These indirect costs can be considered easily ‘directly attributable’ only if it is possible to measure the connected ‘flows of services’. The article shows that the concept developed by De Minico in early twentieth century of Italy confirms the idea that some theoretical frameworks for a causal allocation of <b>common</b> <b>costs</b> were in existence many decades before information technology made such systems a practical proposition...|$|R

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} model {{considering}} fairness {{in the problem}} of crew scheduling for bus drivers (CSP-BD) using a hybrid ant-colony optimization (HACO) algorithm to solve it. The main contributions of this work are the following: (a) a valid approach for cases with a special cost structure and constraints considering the fairness of working time and idle time; (b) an improved algorithm incorporating Gamma heuristic function and selecting rules. The relationships of each cost are examined with ten bus lines collected from the Beijing Public Transport Holdings (Group) Co., Ltd., {{one of the largest}} bus transit companies in the world. It shows that unfair cost is indirectly related to <b>common</b> <b>cost,</b> fixed cost and extra cost and also the unfair <b>cost</b> approaches to <b>common</b> and fixed <b>cost</b> when its coefficient is twice of <b>common</b> <b>cost</b> coefficient. Furthermore, the longest time for the tested bus line with 1108 pieces, 74 blocks is less than 30 minutes. The results indicate that the HACO-based algorithm can be a feasible and efficient optimization technique for CSP-BD, especially with large scale problems...|$|R

40|$|Discussion of airport {{pricing policy}} has largely {{centered}} {{on the problem of}} congestion, but at most airports congestion is negligible. In the present paper we explore the implications of an alternative pricing philosophy where the <b>common</b> <b>costs</b> of runway construction are shared among the different aircraft types according to a club principle. Linear programming and game theory techniques are used to clarify the notions of optimal runway size and fair and efficient landing fees, and to suggest new rules of thumb for allocating <b>common</b> <b>costs</b> based on the Shapley value and the nucleolus. The model is applied to Birmingham Airport to assess investment and pricing policy in 1968 - 1969. To the authors' knowledge this paper is the first explicit application of the "club principle" and the largest numerical application of game theory to date. ...|$|R
