5|$|Many {{writers have}} speculated {{on the ways}} in which a {{friendly}} civilization might interact with humankind. Albert Harrison, a professor emeritus <b>of</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of California, Davis, thought that a highly advanced civilization might teach humanity such things as a physical theory of everything, how to use zero-point energy, or how to travel faster than light. They suggest that collaboration with such a civilization could initially be in the arts and humanities before moving to the hard sciences, and even that artists may spearhead collaboration. Seth D. Baum, of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, and others consider that the greater longevity of cooperative civilizations in comparison to uncooperative and aggressive ones might render extraterrestrial civilizations in general more likely to aid humanity. In contrast to these views, however, Paolo Musso, a member of the SETI Permanent Study Group of the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, took the view that extraterrestrial civilizations possess, like humans, a morality driven not entirely by altruism but for individual benefit as well, thus leaving open the possibility that at least some extraterrestrial civilizations are hostile.|$|E

25|$|Devi {{travelled}} {{the world}} demonstrating her arithmetic talents, including {{a tour of}} Europe in 1950 and a performance in New York City in 1976. In 1988, she travelled to the US to have her abilities studied by Arthur Jensen, a professor <b>of</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of California, Berkeley. Jensen tested her performance of several tasks, including the calculation of large numbers. Examples of the problems presented to Devi included calculating the cube root of 61,629,875 and the seventh root of 170,859,375. Jensen reported that Devi provided {{the solution to the}} above mentioned problems (395 and 15, respectively) before Jensen could copy them down in his notebook.

25|$|Morton Ann Gernsbacher, a {{professor}} <b>of</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Wisconsin–Madison, compares {{the orientation of}} toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a chest of drawers to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and {{it is tempting to}} offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that neuroimaging experiments—which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from mental rotation and facial expressions to grocery shopping and tickling—must strive to avoid such cultural bias and stereotypes.|$|E

500|$|In 2004 Josephson criticized an {{experiment}} by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry to test claims by Russian schoolgirl Natasha Demkina {{that she could}} see inside people's bodies using a special kind of vision. The experiment involved her being asked to match six people to their confirmed medical conditions (plus one with none); to pass the test she had to make five correct matches, but made only four. Josephson argued that this was statistically significant, and that the experiment had set her up to fail. One of the researchers, Richard Wiseman, professor <b>of</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Hertfordshire, responded that Josephson had no record of publishing on parapsychology. Keith Rennolis, professor of applied statistics at the University of Greenwich, supported Josephson's position, asserting that the experiment was [...] "woefully inadequate" [...] to determine any effect.|$|E
500|$|In the Cedillo case, {{her family}} claimed that Michelle was normal until {{receiving}} her vaccines, {{as evidenced by}} a number of videos of her between the age of 6 and 8 months. They also argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines degraded her immune system, which made it possible for the measles virus to infect her and cause autism and the other health problems from which she suffers, which include inflammatory bowel disease, glaucoma and epilepsy. The evidence presented for this consisted primarily of the detection of measles virus in Michelle Cedillo's GI tract. According to the testimony of Marcel Kinsbourne, a pediatric neurologist and professor <b>of</b> <b>psychology</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> New School, the vaccine strain of measles virus caused autism by [...] "...infect the gut and enter the brain, causing dysfunction of astrocytes and other brain cells, which in turn provokes high levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate, causing a state of overstimulation which manifests itself in the symptoms of autism." ...|$|E
