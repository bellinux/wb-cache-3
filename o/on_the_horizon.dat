5|$|In February 2009, U2 {{released}} their 12th studio album, No Line <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Horizon.</b> The album received generally favourable {{reviews and}} debuted at {{number one in}} over 30 countries, but its sales of 5million units were comparatively low by U2 standards {{and it did not}} contain a hit single. Having spent time in Fez, Morocco, recording and absorbing exotic musical influences, the group intended the record to be more experimental than their previous two. However, critics found it to be more conventional than expected. During the five-and-a-half year gestation period for Songs of Innocence, lead singer Bono expressed uncertainty on several occasions over how U2 could remain relevant musically after the relatively lukewarm commercial performance of No Line <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Horizon.</b>|$|E

40|$|We have {{considered}} the flat FRW model of the universe which is filled with only dark energy. The general descriptions of first and second laws of thermodynamics are investigated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> apparent <b>horizon</b> and event <b>horizon</b> of <b>the</b> universe.

We have examined the validity of first and second laws of thermodynamics on apparent and event horizons for these dark energies. For these dark energy models, {{it has been found}} that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> apparent <b>horizon,</b> first and second laws are always valid. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> event <b>horizon,</b> <b>the</b> laws are break down for dark energy models 1 and 2.
