5|$|A Falls Count Anywhere {{match between}} Kurt Angle and Abyss followed, lasting 17 minutes. At {{one point during}} the {{encounter}} while Abyss was standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> floor and Angle was on the stage, Angle performed a running leap off the stage into a somersault senton, connecting with Abyss on the floor. Angle was the victor in the bout, after throwing Abyss off of a scaffold through the Spanish announcers' table, then descending and covering Abyss for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|In October 1960, {{the group}} left Koschmider's club {{to work at}} the Top Ten Club, which Peter Eckhorn ran, as he offered the group more money and a {{slightly}} better place to sleep. In doing so they broke their contract with Koschmider. When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to retrieve their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney found a condom, attached it to a nail <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> wall of the room, and set it alight. There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson. Best and McCartney spent three hours in a local prison and were subsequently deported, as was George Harrison, for working under the legal age limit, on 30 November 1960.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe {{was arrested}} on his return to Southern Rhodesia in December 1963. His trial lasted from January to March 1964, during which he refused to retract the subversive {{statements}} that he had publicly made. In March 1964 {{he was sentenced to}} 21 months imprisonment. Mugabe was first imprisoned at Salisbury Maximum Security Prison, before being moved to the Wha Wha detention centre and then the Sikombela detention centre in Que Que. At the latter, he organised study classes for the inmates, teaching them basic literacy as well as maths and English. Sympathetic black warders smuggled messages from Mugabe {{and other members of the}} ZANU executive committee to activists outside the prison. At the executive's bidding, ZANU activist Herbert Chitepo had organised a small guerrilla force in Lusaka. In April 1966 it carried out a failed attempt to destroy power pylons at Sinoia, and shortly after attacked a white-owned farm near Hartley, killing its inhabitants. The government responded by returning the members of the ZANU executive, including Mugabe, to Salisbury Prison in 1966. There, forty prisoners were divided among four communal cells, with many sleeping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> floor due to overcrowding; Mugabe shared his cell with Sithole, Enos Nkala, and Edgar Tekere. He remained there for eight years, devoting his time to reading and studying. During this period he gained several further degrees from the University of London: a masters in economics, a bachelor of administration, and two law degrees.|$|E

25|$|Where possible, {{the tunnel}} routes avoided granite and instead they were routed through looser shale rock formations; this speeded up {{construction}} and was less labour-intensive, {{but it could}} also be dangerous due to an increased risk of rockfalls. The tunnels were dug by the traditional method of drilling and blasting. When the tunnels were bored out, they were lined with concrete. First, the floor was lined, followed by the walls, and, finally, the roof. The walls were concreted using wooden shuttering, the space between the shuttering and the rock face was filled with concrete, and the shuttering subsequently removed. The roof was made in the same way, but using curved shuttering balancing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> walls. Concrete was poured down the escape shafts rather than through the tunnel entrances to avoid contamination with the rock leaving the tunnel; these chutes can still be seen in many of the tunnels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. According to the {{analysis}} of the current chloride ion eroding model, it has been known that diffusion coefficient and chloride ion concentration <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>concrete’s</b> surface are random variables. Meanwhile <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> protective thickness is also random variable because of manufacturing error and other reasons. So the diffusion process is the random process in fact. The random calculation model of chloride ion concentration in concrete has been deduced from the current model with the help of mathematical knowledge in this paper. Moreover, a satisfied effect has been achieved after comparing the calculated values with the test values. The calculation model is proved to be useful for life prediction and assessment of concrete structures...|$|R
