We conclude, begging your lordship's apostolic benediction, and wishing you a merry Christmas and many happy New Years. Signed on behalf of the pupils of St Peter's School. Laurence Lorigan.|$|E

[...] In response to these accusations of antisemitism, composer and Oberlin College professor Conrad Cummings {{wrote a letter to the}} editor defending Klinghoffer as [...] "the closest analogue to the experience of Bach's audience attending his most demanding works," [...] and noted that, as someone of half-Jewish heritage, he [...] "found nothing anti-Semitic about the work." ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{theories}} of the early universe predict {{the existence of a}} multiverse where bubbles continuously nucleate giving rise to observers in their interior. In this paper, we point out that topological defects of several dimensionalities will also be produced in de Sitter like regions of the multiverse. In particular, defects could be spontaneously nucleated in <b>our</b> <b>parent</b> vacuum. We study the evolution of these defects as they collide with and propagate inside <b>of</b> <b>our</b> bubble. We estimate the present distribution of defects in the observable part of the universe. The expected number of such nearby defects turns out to be quite small, even for the highest nucleation rate. We also study collisions of strings and domain walls with our bubble in our past light cone. We obtain simulated full-sky maps of the loci of such collisions, and find their angular size distribution. Similarly to what happens in the case of bubble collisions, the prospect of detecting any collisions <b>of</b> <b>our</b> bubble with ambient defects is greatly enhanced in the case where the cosmological constant <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>parent</b> vacuum is much higher than the vacuum energy density during inflation in our bubble.

60|$|The doctor frowned slightly. 'Not {{had time}} to think about it,' he repeated, rather severely. 'Not {{had time to}} think about such a serious {{question}} as your particular place of worship! You quite surprise me. Well, if you'll allow me to make a suggestion in the matter it would be that you and Mrs. Le Breton should take seats, for the present at least, at St. Martha's. The parish church is high, decidedly high, and I wouldn't recommend you to go there; most <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>parents</b> don't approve of it. You're an Oxford man, I know, and so I suppose you're rather high yourself; but in this particular matter I would strongly advise you to subordinate your own personal feelings to the parents' wishes. Then there's St. Jude's; St. Jude's is distinctly low--quite Evangelical in fact: indeed, I may say, scarcely what I should consider sound church principles at all in any way; and I think you ought most certainly to avoid it sedulously. Evangelicism is on the decline at present in Pilbury Regis. As to St. Barnabas--Barabbas they call it generally, a most irreverent joke, but, of course, inevitable--Barabbas is absolutely Ritualistic. Many <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>parents</b> object to it most strongly. But St. Martha's is a quiet, moderate, inoffensive church in every respect--sound and sensible, and free from all extremes. You can give no umbrage to anybody, even the most cantankerous, by going to St. Martha's. The High Church people fraternise with it on the one hand, and the moderate church people fraternise with it on the other, while as to the Evangelicals and the dissenters, they hardly contribute any boys to the school, or if they do, they don't object to unobtrusive church principles. Indeed, my experience has been, Le Breton, that even the most rabid dissenters prefer to have their sons educated by a sound, moderate, high-principled, and, if I may say so, neutral-tinted church clergyman.' And the doctor complacently pulled his white tie straight before the big gilt-framed drawing-room mirror.|$|E
60|$|Neither {{my sister}} nor myself grieved as deeply {{for the loss}} of this last <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>parents,</b> as we did for that of the first. We had both seen so many {{instances}} of her devout goodness, had been witnesses of so great a triumph of her faith as to feel an intimate, though silent, persuasion that her death was merely a passage to a better state of existence--that it seemed selfish to regret. Still, we wept and mourned, even while, in one sense, I think we rejoiced. She was relieved from, much bodily suffering, and I remember, when I went to take a last look at her beloved face, that I gazed on its calm serenity with a feeling akin to exultation, as I recollected that pain could no longer exercise dominion over her frame, and that her spirit was then dwelling in bliss. Bitter regrets came later, it is true, and these were fully shared--nay, more than shared--by Grace.|$|E
60|$|Nothing further occurred, {{worthy of}} notice. I passed the {{afternoon}} with Grace, {{in the little}} room; and we conversed much of the past, <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>parents</b> in particular, without adverting, however, to her situation, any further than to apprise her of what I had done. I thought she was not sorry to learn I had sent for Lucy, now that I was with her, {{and it was no}} longer possible her illness could be concealed. As for the physicians, when they were mentioned, I could see a look of tender concern in Grace's eyes, as if she regretted that I still clung to the delusion of hoping to see her health restored. Notwithstanding these little drawbacks, we passed a sweet eventide together. For more than an hour, Grace lay on my bosom, occasionally patting her hand on my cheeks, as the child caresses its mother. This was an old habit of hers, and it was one I was equally delighted and pained to have her resume, now we were of the age and stature of man and woman.|$|E

6000|$|The doctor {{bit his lip}} {{and frowned}} severely. 'Radical,' he said, slowly, with a certain {{delicate}} tinge of acerbity in his tone. 'That's bad. If you will allow me to interpose in the matter, I should strongly advise you, for your own sake, to change them at once and entirely. I don't object to moderate Liberalism--perhaps as many as one-third <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>parents</b> are moderate Liberals; but decidedly the most desirable form of political belief for a successful schoolmaster is a quiet and gentlemanly, but unswerving Conservatism. I don't say {{you ought to be}} an uncompromising old-fashioned Tory--far from it: that alienates not only the dissenters, but even the respectable middle-class Liberals. What is above all things expected in a schoolmaster is a central position in politics, so to speak--a careful avoidance of all extremes--a readiness to welcome all reasonable progress, while opposing in a conciliatory spirit all revolutionary or excessive changes--in short, an attitude of studied moderation. That, if you will allow me to advise you, Le Breton, is the sort of thing, you may depend upon it, that most usually meets the wishes of the largest possible number of pupils' parents.' ...|$|E

This supercilious and impertinent exploration of the generation gone by, by the present generation, is nothing to our credit.
