5|$|Bupropion is {{considered}} moderately dangerous in overdose. For significant overdoses, seizures {{have been reported}} in about a third of all cases; <b>other</b> <b>serious</b> effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported. While most people recover, some people have died, and before they died suffered multiple uncontrolled seizures and heart attacks.|$|E

5|$|Contact with Americans and Europeans in {{the early}} 19th century brought more {{settlers}} to the island, and had a lasting negative ecological effect. On lower slopes, vast tracts of koa–ōhia forest were converted to farmland.

Non-native plants are the <b>other</b> <b>serious</b> threat; there are over 4,600 introduced species on the island, whereas the number of native species is estimated at just 1,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 {{a replica}} Rocket was {{commissioned}} from Robert Stephenson and Company by Henry Ford, using Stephenson's original construction techniques.

5|$|Early in the season, Arthur Carr {{was named}} as England captain {{for the start}} of the series; Carr was a popular choice and the only <b>other</b> <b>serious</b> {{contender}} at the time was Percy Fender. Chapman played in two of the three trial matches and was chosen for the first Test but did not bat in a match ruined by rain. The second Test was drawn but Chapman scored fifty. Australia dominated most of the third Test but England saved the game; Chapman scored 15 and 42 not out in the match. However, Carr's tactical approach during the match was heavily criticised and he dropped a crucial catch on the first morning. Chapman was omitted from the side for the fourth Test, but fielded as substitute when Carr became ill during the game.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, {{occur in}} individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs {{tend to be}} more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if very severe – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or <b>other</b> <b>serious</b> lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, Parma's artillery pounded at {{the walls}} for 3hours with iron cannonballs weighing 30–50 pounds; in total, his artillery fired more than 2700rounds. The Spanish made several attempts to storm the city, each repelled by Cloedt's 1600soldiers. The ninth assault breached the outer wall. The Spanish and Italian forces entered the town from opposite ends and met in the middle. Cloedt, gravely injured (his leg was reportedly almost ripped off and he had five <b>other</b> <b>serious</b> wounds), had been carried into the town. Parma's troops discovered Cloedt, being nursed by {{his wife and his}} sister. Although Parma was inclined to honor the garrison commander with a soldier's death by sword, Ernst demanded his immediate execution.

5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav {{remained}} well offshore, the difference in pressure between it and a high pressure area over the central United States caused strong winds in areas of New Jersey on September 11. Wind gusts ranged from 35–45mph (55–70km/h), with stronger winds reported near the coast. A maximum wind gust of 60mph (100km/h) was reported at Keansburg. The strong winds downed trees and power lines throughout {{the eastern half of}} the state, damaging homes and blocking streets. At least 14,000 homes in the vicinity of Burlington and Ocean Counties were left without power. In West Windsor Township, a man was killed when the upper section of a concrete wall he was working on blew over and crushed him. The other death occurred in West Amwell Township, where a tree limb fell on two elderly women, killing one and injuring the other. Elsewhere, while there were reports of trees falling on vehicles, no <b>other</b> <b>serious</b> injuries or deaths were reported.|$|E
