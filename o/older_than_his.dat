5|$|Edmund {{was born}} either in 1015, 1016 or 1017. Edmund's mother was {{probably}} Ealdgyth, Edmund Ironside's wife; {{it is possible}} that she was only his stepmother, as the king's death in November 1016 left space of only one year for two children to be born. Although {{there is a possibility that}} Edmund was <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> brother, later known as Edward the Exile, it is also possible that they were twins. At the time, it was customary for posthumous sons to bear their father's name; thus, Edmund could have been the younger, posthumous son.|$|E
5|$|As Feodora grew older, various suitors were {{considered}} for marriage. The exiled Prince Peter Karađorđević, thirty-six years her senior, unsuccessfully requested {{her hand in}} marriage. Another potential candidate was her cousin Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In late 1897, Feodora became engaged to Prince Henry XXX of Reuss, and they married the following year, on 24 September 1898 in a Lutheran ceremony at Breslau. The groom was fifteen years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> bride and a captain in a Brunswick regiment, but not wealthy or particularly high-ranked. Many in the family were shocked at the marriage, but the Dowager Empress was at least pleased that her granddaughter seemed happy with the match.|$|E
5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E

25|$|Notes: 1) The {{story has}} some {{parallels}} to {{the legend of}} John Henry. 2) In this story it is learned that England's American colonies broke off into a new nation - the Federated Commonwealths of America - in 1738, and westward expansion began much sooner than in our history, {{due to the lack}} of indigenous humans in the regions to be colonized. 3) The character Trevithick is American rather than British, and appears to be 20 years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> historic age, so he is probably not the historical figure but an analog. In Turtledove works, it is common for historic figures to have fictitious offspring (as with Edward Wingfield's daughter and her own great-grandson Thomas Kenton above) as a result of the butterfly effect.|$|E
25|$|As Jessop relates, a rift in her {{religious}} community {{at about the}} time she completed middle school led to the leaders pulling children out of the local high school. She {{graduated from high school}} at the age of 17. Jessop intended to attend college and then go to medical school to study pediatric medicine; instead, she was forced into an arranged marriage to Merril Jessop at age 18. Merril Jessop was 32 years her senior and already had three wives and more than 30 children, several of them <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>his</b> new wife. Once married, Carolyn Jessop did get to attend college, but her husband decided that she would study elementary education, not medicine. Just months into the marriage, the FLDS's new leader, Rulon Jeffs, gave Merril two new wives.|$|E
