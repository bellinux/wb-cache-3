5000|$|In Britain, sage has {{for generations}} been listed {{as one of}} the {{essential}} herbs, along with parsley, rosemary, and thyme (as in the folk song [...] "Scarborough Fair"). It has a savory, slightly peppery flavor. It appears in many European cuisines, notably Italian, Balkan and Middle Eastern cookery. In Italian cuisine, it is an essential condiment for saltimbocca and other dishes, favored with fish. In British and American cooking, it is traditionally served as sage and onion stuffing, an accompaniment to roast turkey or chicken at Christmas or Thanksgiving Day. Other dishes include pork casserole, <b>Sage</b> <b>Derby</b> <b>cheese</b> and Lincolnshire sausages. Despite the common use of traditional and available herbs in French cuisine, sage never found favor there.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Sage</b> <b>Derby</b> [...] is {{a variety}} of <b>Derby</b> <b>cheese</b> that is mild, mottled green and semi-hard, and has a sage flavour. The colour is from sage and {{sometimes}} other colouring added to the curds, producing a marbling effect and a subtle herb flavour. The colour is formed either by mixing sage leaves into the curd before it is pressed or {{by the addition of}} [...] "green curd" [...] from green corn or spinach juice. In the latter case, the flavour has to be created with colourless sage extract. Parsley, spinach and marigold leaves, bruised and steeped before use, can also be included instead of the sage leaves. It is aged for one to three months.|$|R

5000|$|Little Derby is a Derby-style cheese made outside Derbyshire, {{similar in}} flavour and texture to Cheddar, {{but without the}} anatto {{colouring}} used in <b>Derby</b> <b>cheese.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{production}} {{began in}} the seventeenth century in England. <b>Sage</b> <b>Derby</b> was initially <b>only</b> made for festive occasions such as harvest time and Christmas, but it is now available all year.|$|R
50|$|Others are {{produced}} {{from a combination}} of the curds of white and orange cheddars (for Marbled Cheddar), or similar. The marbling is usually not achieved with artificial additives, though cheeses such as Red Windsor and <b>Sage</b> <b>Derby</b> contain colourings such as Chlorophyll (E140) and Carmine (E120).|$|R
50|$|One {{manufacturer}} of the cheese, Fowlers, {{is based in}} Earlswood, Warwickshire, having moved from Derbyshire in 1918. Their Little <b>Derby</b> <b>cheese</b> is made with pasteurised cow's milk, producing a semi-hard cheese with a fat content of about 48%. Anatto is not used, but the rinds of the 40 cm diameter wheels are washed with red wine to give an orange colour. The 10 kg cheeses are matured for seven months.|$|R
50|$|November/December 2008 was {{the last}} print edition of the Bulletin, which became digital <b>only.</b> <b>SAGE</b> Publications began {{publishing}} the Bulletin in September 2010. Taylor and Francis took over from Sage in January 2016.|$|R
50|$|<b>Derby</b> <b>cheese</b> is a mild, semi-firm British cow's milk cheese made in Derbyshire with a smooth, mellow {{texture and}} a buttery flavour. Like {{most of the}} {{traditional}} British hard cheeses it was produced exclusively on farms and was typically sold {{at a younger age}} than its more famous cousins Cheddar and Cheshire. It has a pale, golden orange interior with a natural or waxed rind and ripens at between one and six months. In many respects Derby is similar to Cheddar in taste and texture, but with a softer body (it doesn’t go through the Cheddaring process) and slightly higher moisture content. When young it is springy and mild but as it matures subtle sweet flavours develop and the texture becomes firmer.|$|R

50|$|On Christmas Day of 1838 {{he married}} Elizabeth Sage, {{daughter}} of Isaac <b>Sage</b> of <b>Derby,</b> hurriedly returning to London {{the same day}} {{so as not to}} fall behind in his work. From 1839 to 1845 he was employed by the engraver Frederick William Fairholt, to illustrate the works of Charles Knight, and contribute to the Pictorial Times, the Saturday Magazine, the Illustrated London News and Punch. He worked at Buckingham Palace in 1845, sketching the palace rooms in preparation for a work on London Interiors.|$|R
60|$|With this {{apostrophe}} Mr Fledgeby appropriately {{proceeded to}} divest himself of his Turkish garments, and invest himself with Christian attire. Pending which operation, and his morning ablutions, and his anointing of {{himself with the}} last infallible preparation {{for the production of}} luxuriant and glossy hair upon the human countenance (quacks being the <b>only</b> <b>sages</b> he believed in besides usurers), the murky fog closed about him and shut him up in its sooty embrace. If it had never let him out any more, the world would have had no irreparable loss, but could have easily replaced him from its stock on hand.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} coordinated {{atmospheric}} ozone profile measurements was made during October and November 1988. <b>Only</b> <b>SAGE</b> II measurements made within 1000 km {{of both of}} the ground, sites were considered for this intercomparison study. It was found that, {{at least for the}} time of year of the study, SAGE II measurements agreed only when they were made much closer than 1000 km (less than 500 km) from the other sites, and this is explained in terms of the large latitudinal gradient observed in the ozone concentration profile. Agreement to 5 percent was seen between the instruments, over the altitude range from 20 to 50 km, when the measurements were made close together in both time and space...|$|R

60|$|Lucy ran out too, {{and beyond}} him. She saw <b>only</b> <b>Sage</b> King. He saw her, {{recognized}} her, and, whistled even while Joel was pulling him in. For once the King showed {{he was glad}} to see Lucy. He had been having rough treatment. But he was not winded--only hot and wet. She assured herself of that, then ran to quiet the plunging Sarch. He came down at once, and pushed his big nose almost into her face. She hugged his great, hot neck. He was quivering all over. Lucy heard the other horses pounding up; she recognized Two Face's high whinny, like a squeal; and in her delight she was about to run to them when Creech's harsh voice arrested her. And sight of Joel's face suddenly made her weak.|$|R
500|$|Later Stoics—such as Seneca and Epictetus—emphasized that, because [...] "virtue is {{sufficient}} for happiness", a sage was immune to misfortune. This belief {{is similar to the}} meaning of the phrase [...] "stoic calm", though the phrase does not include the [...] "radical ethical" [...] Stoic views that <b>only</b> a <b>sage</b> can be considered truly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.|$|R
5000|$|In Confucianism, {{the ideal}} {{personality}} is the sheng, translated as sage. However, sagehood {{is hard to}} attain and so Confucius created the junzi, gentleman, which more individuals could achieve. Zhu Xi defined junzi as second <b>only</b> to the <b>sage.</b>|$|R

40|$|Over the years, several {{different}} radiochemical {{systems have been}} proposed as solar neutrino detectors. Of these, two achieved operating status and obtained important results that helped to define the current field of neutrino physics: the first solar-neutrino experiment, the Chlorine Detector ({sup 37 }Cl) that was developed by chemist Raymond Davis and colleagues at the Homestake Mine, and the subsequent Gallium ({sup 71 }Ga) Detectors that were operated by (a) the SAGE collaboration at the Baksan Laboratory and (b) the GALLEX/GNO collaborations at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory. These experiments have been extensively discussed in the literature and in many previous International Neutrino Conferences. In this paper, I present important updates to the results from SAGE and GALLEX/GNO. I also review {{the principles of the}} radiochemical detectors and briefly describe {{several different}} detectors that have been proposed. In light of the well-known successes that have been subsequently obtained by real-time neutrino detectors such as Kamiokande, Super-Kamiokande, SNO, and KamLAND, I do not anticipate that any new radiochemical neutrino detectors will be built. At present, <b>only</b> <b>SAGE</b> is still operating; the Chlorine and GNO radiochemical detectors have been decommissioned and dismantled...|$|R
50|$|In Babylonia the Exilarch {{was almost}} always a rabbinical personality. The Geonim such as Saadia Gaon (892-942) were not <b>only</b> great <b>sages</b> but also {{political}} guides. The writings and rulings of those such as Rashi (1040-1105), Maimonides (1135-1204), Yosef Karo (1488-1575) who published the most widely accepted code of Jewish law the Shulkhan Arukh, Isaac Luria (1534-1572), the Vilna Gaon (1720-1797), the Chafetz Chaim (1838-1933) and many others have shaped Jewish law for almost two thousand years, as their religious rulings were published, distributed, studied, and observed until the present time.|$|R

25|$|The Hasmonean {{court in}} the Land of Israel, presided over by Alexander Jannaeus, king of Judea until 76 BCE, {{followed}} by his wife, was called Synhedrion or Sanhedrin. The exact nature of this early Sanhedrin is not clear. It {{may have been a}} body of sages or priests, or a political, legislative and judicial institution. The first historical record of the body was during the administration of Aulus Gabinius, who, according to Josephus, organized five synedra in 57 BCE as Roman administration was not concerned with religious affairs unless sedition was suspected. Only after the destruction of the Second Temple was the Sanhedrin made up <b>only</b> of <b>sages.</b>|$|R

50|$|A Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) {{facility}} was built and activated in June 1961. The DC-19 SAGE Data Center was {{housed in a}} huge, windowless blast-resistant concrete building {{with a pair of}} 275-ton AN/FSQ-7 computers which displayed the live air picture to the many scopes of the weapons and air surveillance operations in the various units on the 2nd floor. The computers processed air surveillance information and sent the data to Air Defense Command units. It was the <b>only</b> two-story <b>SAGE</b> blockhouse in ADC. The Minot SAGE {{facility was}} deactivated after less than two years of operation, in May 1963, The facility was then renamed the PRIDE Building ("Professional Results in Daily Effort") after ADC's and SAC's alternate motto of the 1960s and 1970s, and became a large office building housing many different organizations.|$|R
25|$|Secular {{scholars}} see {{the discrepancy}} between the traditional and secular date of the destruction of the First Temple arising as a result of Jewish sages missing out the reign lengths of several Persian kings during the Persian Empire's rule over Israel.

50|$|In {{times of}} yore, Lord Brahma {{came to the}} earth to perform a Yaga (fire Sacrifice). He {{did it in the}} present Varkala. He was so much {{immersed}} in doing Yaga that he forgot his job of creation. Lord Vishnu came to Varkala to remind Lord Brahma about it {{in the form of a}} very old man. The Brahmins assisting Lord Brahma, received the old man and gave him food. But whatever he ate, his hunger was not satiated. Lord Brahma’s assistants went and told him about it. Then Lord Brahma could understand that the guest was Lord Vishnu himself. He immediately came near Lord Vishnu and found him trying to eat Aabhojanam. Lord Brahma then prevented Lord Vishnu from eating it and told him - “Lord, if you eat it, then the final deluge will swallow this world.“ Lord Vishnu then requested Lord Brahma to stop the Yaga and recommence his job of creation. He also showed him his 'Viswaroopa'. After this one day Sage Narada followed by Lord Vishnu was walking in the sky over Varkala. Lord Brahma who came there saluted Lord Vishnu. The nine Prajapathis to whom <b>only</b> <b>sage</b> Narada was visible laughed at Lord Brahma. Because they thought that Lord Brahma was saluting his own son Sage Narada. Then Lord Brahma corrected them. They felt sad at having committed a sinful deed. Lord Brahma told them that the proper place to pray for their redemption would be shown to them by sage Narada. Sage Narada threw the Valkala (deer’s skin) that he was wearing towards the earth. It fell in the present Varkala. The Prajapathis wanted a pond to do the atonement. Sage Narada requested lord Vishnu, who made a pond there, using his Chakra (wheel). The Prajapathis did thapas there and were pardoned for their sins. It is believed that the 'Devas' constructed a temple of Lord Vishnu there and were worshiping the Lord Janardhana.|$|R
5|$|The only {{significant}} Celestial Master text that survives from the Hanzhong period is the Xiang'er commentary to the Dao De Jing. This text gives {{insight into the}} Celestial Masters’ physiological beliefs, meditation practices and rituals. In addition, the commentary reinterprets the Dao De Jing {{to have all of}} humanity as its intended audience, instead of <b>only</b> a <b>sage.</b> The Taiping Jing, a text attributed to the Yellow Turbans, was not a Celestial Master text, but reflects at least in part some Celestial Master thought and practice. A later text written in 255 CE, known as the Commands and Admonitions for the Families of the Great Dao was composed to a divided Celestial Master community after the dispersal of the Hanzhong population. While written in the persona of Zhang Lu, it is probable that this text was not written by him, as he had probably died by 255 CE.|$|R
