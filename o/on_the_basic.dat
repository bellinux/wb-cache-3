5|$|In {{this section}} Tolkien {{describes}} variations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> patterns. For example, dips (between lifts) were usually monosyllabic, {{but the number}} of syllables was not limited by Old English metre, so a series of weak syllables was permitted in a half-line. Other variations included breaking a lift into two syllables, the first short but stressed, the second weak, with for instance 'vĕssel' in place of 'boat'.|$|E

5|$|In 1959 the Defense Department ordered {{one more}} study <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> Zeus system, {{this time by}} the PSAC. They put {{together}} a heavyweight group {{with some of the}} most famous and influential scientists forming its core, including Hans Bethe who had worked on the Manhattan Project and later on the hydrogen bomb, Wolfgang Panofsky, the director of the High-Energy Physics Lab at Stanford University, and Harold Brown, director of the Lawrence Livermore weapons lab, among similar luminaries. The PSAC report was almost a repeat of the RBIG. They recommended that Zeus should not be built, at least without significant changes to allow it to better deal with the emerging problems.|$|E

Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter note the presence of a piano part on the recording as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{present form}} of the {{doctrine}} seems to be unchanged {{at least since the}} time of Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE) who is respected by both the sects. This is supported by the fact that both Svetambara and Digambara sects agree <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> doctrine, giving indication that it reached in its present form before the schism took place. Bhadrabahu is usually seen as the last leader of united Jain sangh. Detailed codification of types of karma and their effects were attested by Umasvati who is regarded by both Digambara and Svetambara as one of theirs.|$|E

5|$|Desert Strike was {{followed}} by four sequels Jungle Strike, Urban Strike, Soviet Strike, and Nuclear Strike that expanded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> gameplay it established. The design staff made efforts to retain game mechanics they felt embodied {{the core of the}} original. They believed removing those elements would result in a loss of focus of what attracted fans. As the series moved to more advanced consoles, Posehn became less involved in the programming side of development. Jungle Strike and Urban Strike, both released for the Genesis, featured additional vehicles and locations. Soviet Strike, released for the original PlayStation and the Sega Saturn in 1996, featured 3D graphics, as did Nuclear Strike, released on PC and PlayStation in 1997 and the Nintendo 64 in 1999. A fifth sequel provisionally titled Future Strike was planned, but the game was eventually released as , a mech-based shooter game.|$|E
5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a model with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories were based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E
5|$|The Queen, seeking {{support of}} her own son's claims to the throne over those of Surendra, invited Mathabar Singh Thapa back after almost six years in exile. Upon his arrival in Kathmandu, an {{investigation}} of his uncle's death took place, {{and a number of}} his Pande enemies were massacred. As for Ranajang Pande, he had by that time contracted mental illness and would not have posed any threat to Mathabar. Nevertheless, Ranajang was paraded through the streets and made to witness the execution of his family members, after which he was forced to commit suicide by poison. By December 1843, Mathabar Singh was appointed prime minister; but after a year in power, he alienated both the King and the Queen by supporting Surendra's claim over the throne. On May 17, 1845, he was assassinated, on both the King and Queen's orders, by his nephew, Jang Bahadur Kunwar. The death of Mathabar Singh ended the Thapa hegemony and set the stage for Kot massacre and the establishment of Rana Dynasty, a dictatorship of hereditary prime ministers, which was founded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> template provided by Bhimsen Thapa. These events provided the long period of stability the country needed but at the cost of political and economic development.|$|E

5|$|This {{suggestion}} {{stemmed from}} the observation that many engineers relied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> principles of physics and mechanics to guide their work, and yet this often required inventors and engineers to become scientists as well to obtain experimental data—something that they were rarely qualified or resourced to do. Short of government funding of such research, Evans also attempted to create {{in the aftermath of}} the Steam Engineer's Guide what he called 'The Experiment Company', which would be a private research consortium to conduct reliable experiments and gather data for the benefits of subscribed members. The venture failed and Evans could find no paying stockholders to launch it, possibly due to Evans committing the new venture to developing a steam wagon of his own design. The Franklin Institute would be founded in Philadelphia a few years after Evans's death on similar principles.|$|E
