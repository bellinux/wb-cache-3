The modern inhabitants, as their forebearers, continue to utilise the marine resources available. Lake Grassmere is the country's only salt works, producing 50% of the countries total salt requirement. Fishing and mussel farming are also extremely important in the region. Viticulture also has a very large impact on the local economy both directly, by way of employment and servicing required, and also by way of 'wine tourism'. The local cellars attracted hundreds of thousands of domestic and international tourists every year. The area also hosts the annual Marlborough Wine & Food Festival. Marlborough is now New Zealand's largest wine producing region, receiving worldwide recognition for its sauvignon blanc wines. <b>Olive</b> <b>growing</b> has also become popular in recent years.|$|E

The family {{may have been}} {{involved}} in <b>olive</b> <b>growing</b> and been impoverished during a crisis in the industry in the 1890s.

A passionate self-educator, Agnew maintained a lifelong interest in philosophy; one family member recalled that [...] "if he wasn't reading something to improve his mind, he wouldn't read." [...] Around 1908, he moved to Baltimore, where he purchased a restaurant. Here he met William Pollard, who was the city's federal meat inspector. The two became friends; Pollard and his wife Margaret were regular customers of the restaurant. After Pollard died in April 1917, Agnew and Margaret Pollard began a courtship which led to their marriage on December 12, 1917. Spiro Agnew was born eleven months later, on November 9, 1918.|$|E
