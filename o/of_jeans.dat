5|$|The {{perceived}} {{deficiencies of}} the Laplacian model stimulated scientists {{to find a}} replacement for it. During the 20th century many theories addressed the issue, including the planetesimal theory of Thomas Chamberlin and Forest Moulton (1901), the tidal model <b>of</b> <b>Jeans</b> (1917), the accretion model of Otto Schmidt (1944), the protoplanet theory of William McCrea (1960) and finally the capture theory of Michael Woolfson. In 1978 Andrew Prentice resurrected the initial Laplacian ideas about planet formation and developed the modern Laplacian theory. None of these attempts proved completely successful, {{and many of the}} proposed theories were descriptive.|$|E

40|$|The jeans {{industry}} has evolved {{and has become}} an integral part of American culture. However, there are concerns about chemicals used in the production <b>of</b> blue <b>jeans</b> so that recycling <b>of</b> used <b>jeans</b> is needed (Woodward 2 ̆ 6 Miller, 2011). The first objective of creating this design was to create a sustainable garment using recycled jeans. A second objective was to combine symbols from the East and from the West to encourage use <b>of</b> recycled <b>jeans</b> world-wide. The inspiration for the design came from the Korean traditional garment, Hanbok, that best expresses the beauty of Korea (Kang 2 ̆ 6 Kim, 2013) ...|$|R

5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends <b>of</b> <b>jeans,</b> satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood dyed fabrics, that would eventually fade to the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from piped or taped collars, cuffs, and front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|E
25|$|Sailors {{may have}} played a role in the {{worldwide}} dissemination of trousers as a fashion. In the 17th and 18th centuries, sailors wore baggy trousers known as galligaskins.

These became more popular in the late 19th century in the American West because of their ruggedness and durability.|$|E

The outfit worn by the typical college girl was a skirt that was usually shorter than current fashion, and a shirtwaist, which is best described as the equivalent <b>of</b> <b>jeans</b> and a T-shirt today.|$|E

25|$|Butch Cassidy's first {{criminal}} {{offense was}} minor. Around 1880, he journeyed to a clothier's shop in another town but found the shop closed. He entered {{the shop and}} stole a pair <b>of</b> <b>jeans</b> and some pie, leaving an IOU promising to pay on his next visit. The clothier pressed charges. Cassidy was acquitted at a jury trial. He continued to work on ranches until 1884, {{when he moved to}} Telluride, Colorado, ostensibly to seek work but perhaps to deliver stolen horses to buyers. He led a cowboy's life in Wyoming and Montana before returning to Telluride in 1887. There he met Matt Warner, the owner of a race horse. Cassidy and Warner raced the horse at various events, dividing the winnings between them.|$|E
25|$|The systems {{described}} above are ideal types: real systems may present themselves as hybrids of those categories. Consider, for example, that the production <b>of</b> <b>jeans</b> involves initially carding, spinning, dyeing and weaving, then cutting the fabric in different shapes and assembling the parts in pants or jackets {{by combining the}} fabric with thread, zippers and buttons, finally finishing and distressing the pants/jackets before being shipped to stores. The beginning {{can be seen as}} process production, the middle as part production and the end again as process production: it's unlikely that a single company will keep all the stages of production under a single roof, therefore the problem of vertical integration and outsourcing arises. Most products require, from a supply chain perspective, both process production and part production.|$|E
