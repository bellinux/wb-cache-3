50|$|The Fig <b>Tree</b> <b>Formation</b> is a stromatolite-containing {{geological}} formation in South Africa. The rock contains fossils of microscopic life forms about three billion years old. Identified organisms include the bacterium Eobacterium Isolatus and the algae-like Archaeosphaeroides barbertonensis. The fossils in the Fig <b>Tree</b> <b>Formation</b> are considered {{some of the}} oldest known organisms on Earth, and provide evidence that life may have existed much earlier than previously thought.|$|R

5000|$|Roztoczański National Park boasts unique <b>tree</b> <b>formations.</b> There {{are more}} than 400 {{so-called}} [...] "nature monument" [...] trees and the park’s firs are among the largest in Poland (up to 50 meters high).|$|R
50|$|In {{the central}} {{north of the}} Sheffield element is the Early Arenig age Caroline Creek Sandstone {{on a bed of}} chert conglomerate. The Cabbage <b>Tree</b> <b>Formation</b> is east of the Andersons Creek Ultramafic Complex, and is {{sandstone}} and conglomerate.|$|R
40|$|A {{syntactic}} <b>tree</b> <b>formation</b> {{system is}} described {{for use in}} incremental sentence generators, i. e. generators which allow for parallel planning of conceptual content and linguistic expression. The system achieves full generality {{in the sense that}} (1) all forms of incremental production (upward expansions, downward expansions, and insertions) are covered, and (2) branches of a syntactic tree are grown in a maximally independent way (3) {{while at the same time}} grammatically of the utterance as a whole can be maintained (aside from 'syntactic deadlocks'). The <b>tree</b> <b>formation</b> system is called Incremental Grammar (1 G). Two novel ideas are the use of node-arc-node segments as elementary building blocks (e. g S-subject-NP, S-object-S, NP-head-N, PP-object-NP), and the introduction of feature matrices associated with segments rather than with nodes. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{specification}} and verification work {{is described}} in detail, {{and some of the}} problems and issues to be resolved in their application to Very Large Scale Integration VLSI systems are examined. The hierarchical design methodologies enable a system architect or design team to decompose a complex design into a formal hierarchy of levels of abstraction. The first step inprogram verification is <b>tree</b> <b>formation.</b> The next step after <b>tree</b> <b>formation</b> is the generation from the trees of the verification conditions themselves. The approach taken here is similar in spirit to the corresponding step in program verification but requires modeling of the semantics of circuit elements rather than program statements. The last step is that of proving the verification conditions using a mechanical theorem-prover...|$|R

This study {{contains}} the phytocoenological characteristics (composition, structure and distribution) of plant {{communities in the}} coniferous vegetation belt of Mt Batashka (West Rhodopes).

50|$|Eobacterium is an extinct genus of {{bacteria}} from the Fig <b>Tree</b> <b>Formation</b> in Africa. It is about 3 billion years old, {{one of the}} oldest known living organisms. The discovery of Eobacterium and other Fig Tree organisms in the 1960s helped prove that life existed over three billion years ago.|$|R

50|$|Although wingers are a {{familiar}} part of football, {{the use of}} wingers {{is by no means}} universal. There are many successful football teams who operate without wingers. A famous example is Milan, who typically play in a narrow midfield diamond formation or in a Christmas <b>tree</b> <b>formation</b> (4-3-2-1), relying on full-backs to provide the necessary width down the wings.|$|R
50|$|Monticello {{is located}} {{at the base of the}} Abajo Mountains, or the Blue Mountains, which are part of the Manti-La Sal National Forest. The {{elevation}} of Monticello is 7069 ft. From Monticello, a <b>tree</b> <b>formation</b> on the Blue Mountains can be seen, which resembles a horse's head and neck, which can be seen from any point in town.|$|R
50|$|Trees of Mystery is {{a tourist}} {{attraction}} near the coastal town of Klamath, California. It features many Giant Redwoods {{and a number of}} unusual <b>tree</b> <b>formations,</b> many of which can be seen from its Trail of Mysterious Trees. Its Trail of Tall Tales displays some 50 chainsaw sculptures and carvings illustrating stories of legendary logger Paul Bunyan and his crew.|$|R

30|$|Sink sites (sojourn points) {{are either}} {{predetermined}} or chosen using a sink-site determination method. Some example methods {{are given in}} [30]. Those sink sites are associated with each sink using a method that we explain in the next section. Sinks visit those sites (combinations) together and start the topology <b>tree</b> <b>formation</b> process to construct their matrices if the sensor nodes’ positions are not known a priori.|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in wireless ad hoc networks built from portable devices equipped with short-range wireless network interfaces. This paper addresses {{issues related to}} internetworking such networks to form larger "scatternets. " Within the constraints imposed by the emerging standard Bluetooth link layer and MAC protocol, we describe an efficient online topology formation algorithm, called TSF (<b>Tree</b> Scatternet <b>Formation)</b> to build scatternets. TSF connects nodes in a tree structure that simplifies packet routing and scheduling. The design allows nodes to arrive and leave arbitrarily, incrementally building the topology and healing partitions when they occur. We present simulation results that show that TSF has low <b>tree</b> <b>formation</b> latency and also generates an efficient topology for forwarding packets...|$|R

3000|$|In {{the third}} paper, [...] "Determining {{localized}} tree construction schemes based on sensor network lifetime," [...] Lee et al. study the network lifetime of different localized data gathering <b>tree</b> <b>formation</b> algorithms {{by considering the}} communication overhead due to imperfect link quality. Via analysis, they show the tradeoff between link-quality-based schemes and minimum-hop-routing-based schemes in terms of network lifetime. They also present a guidance to design localized scheme for longer network lifetime.|$|R
40|$|A Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is {{characterized}} by the lack of any infrastructure, absence of any kind of centralized administration, frequent mobility of nodes, network partitioning, and wireless connections. These properties make traditional wireline security solutions not straightforwardly applicable in MANETs, and of course, constitute the establishment of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in such networks a cumbersome task. After surveying related work, we propose a novel public key management scheme using the well-known web-of-trust or trust graph model. Our scheme is based on a binary <b>tree</b> <b>formation</b> of the network&# 39;s nodes. The binary tree structure is proved very effective for building certificate chains between communicating nodes that are multihops away and the cumbersome problem of certificate chain discovery is avoided. We compare our scheme with related work and show that it presents several advantages, especially when a fair balancing between security and performance is desirable. Simulations of the proposed scheme under different scenarios demonstrate that it is effective in terms of <b>tree</b> <b>formation,</b> join and leave occurrences, and certificate chain establishment...|$|R
