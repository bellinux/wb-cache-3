25|$|For a basic {{oxy-acetylene}} rig, {{the cutting}} speed in light steel section will usually be {{nearly twice as}} fast as a petrol-driven cut-off grinder. The advantages when cutting large sections are obvious: an oxy-fuel torch is light, small and quiet and needs very little effort to use, whereas a cut-off grinder is heavy and noisy and needs considerable operator exertion and may vibrate severely, leading to stiff hands and possible long-term vibration white finger. <b>Oxy-acetylene</b> <b>torches</b> can easily cut through ferrous materials in excess of 200mm (8inches). Oxygen lances are used in scrapping operations and cut sections thicker than 200mm (8inches). Cut-off grinders are useless for these kinds of application.|$|R

50|$|Arc strike {{cracking}} {{occurs when}} the arc is struck but the spot is not welded. This occurs because the spot is heated above the material's upper critical temperature and then essentially quenched. This forms martensite, which is brittle and may lead to higher chances of micro-cracks. Usually the arc is struck in the weld groove so this type of crack does not occur, but if the arc is struck outside of the weld groove then it must be welded over to prevent the cracking.

50|$|The {{terminations}} of the First World War and the Second World War both {{resulted in}} temporary booms for the ship breaking industry {{as hundreds of}} worn-out or obsolete warships were sold for disposal. In the 1930s, it became cheaper to 'beach' a boat and run her ashore as opposed to using a dry dock. The ship would have to weigh {{as little as possible}} and run ashore at full speed. Dismantling operations required a 10 feet rise of tide and close proximity to a steel-works. Electric shears, a wrecking ball and <b>oxy-acetylene</b> <b>torches</b> were used.

50|$|The {{double-sided}} impeller was 28.8 {{inches in}} diameter, compared to 20.68 for the Derwent I, {{to produce an}} airflow of 80 lb/s, while the overall diameter of the engine was 49.5 inches. A scaled up Derwent would have a 60-inch diameter. The compressor casing was based on Whittle's Type 16 W.2/500 compressor case which was more aerodynamically efficient than that on the Derwent but also eliminated cracking. Other design advances included nine new low pressure-drop/high efficiency combustion chambers developed by Lucas and a small impeller for rear bearing and turbine disc cooling. The first engine start was attempted on 27 October 1944. A number of snags delayed the run until nearly midnight, when with almost the entire day and night shift staff watching, {{an attempt was made}} to start the engine, without the inlet vanes, which had not yet been fitted. To everyone's dismay the engine refused to light - positioning the igniter was a trial-and-error affair at the time.

5000|$|Clause 8 {{said the}} Crown would keep a freight shed in repair, where Canada Steamship’s goods were being stored.

Clause 7 said ‘the lessee shall not have any claim… for… damage… to… goods… being… in the said shed.’ Clause 17 said “the lessee shall at all times indemnify ... the lessor from and against all claims ... by whomsoever made ... in any manner based upon, occasioned by or attributable to the execution of these presents, or any action taken or things done ... by virtue hereof, or the exercise in any manner of rights arising hereunder.” Lord Morton of Henryton for the Privy Council said that clause 7 did not exclude negligence liability in clear enough terms and clause 17 was ambiguous and would be construed against the Crown. The Crown could realistically be said to have been strictly liable for damage to the goods (e.g. by breach of obligation to keep the shed in repair) and were therefore negligence should not be covered. He set out these principles.(1) if a clause expressly excludes liability for negligence (or an appropriate synonym [...] ) then effect is given to that. If not, (2) ask whether the words are wide enough to exclude negligence and if there is doubt that is resolved against the one relying on the clause. If that is satisfied then (3) ask whether the clause could cover some alternative liability other than for negligence, and if it can it covers that.|$|E

40|$|Objective was {{to assess}} {{techniques}} for joining NZP ceramics, a new family of ceramic materials that have low coefficient of thermal expansion, low thermal conductivity, and excellent thermal-shock resistance. Initially, the authors evaluated laser-beam welding over volatile fluxing agents (ferric oxide, copper oxide, boric acid, and boron nitride). They also examined other laser, arc-welding, brazing, and cold joining techniques. The NZP materials were capable of sustaining the thermal stresses associated with these joining processes without substantial cracking. Of the volatile fluxes, only the copper oxide promoted weld fusion. Efforts to accomplish fusion by laser-beam welding over copper, titanium, stainless steel, yttrium barium copper oxide, fused silica glass, and mullite/alumina were unsuccessful. Gas-tungsten arc welding accompanied by porosity, irregularities, and cracking was achieved on copper sheet sandwiched between NZP tiles.

It consists of 67 elementary reaction steps and 41 species, and contains CH 3 and C 2 H 2 as gas-phase growth precursors and atomic hydrogen and oxygen to etch carbon from the surface. The gas-phase and surface chemistry models were tested in one-dimensional simulations, yielding dependencies of the growth rate on feed composition and surface temperature that are in qualitative agreement with the experiments.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{model is}} presented for the hydrodynamics and chemistry of an <b>oxy-acetylene</b> <b>torch</b> reactor for {{chemical vapor deposition}} of diamond, and it is validated against spectroscopy and growth rate data from the literature. The model combines the laminar equations for flow, heat, and mass transfer with combustion and deposition chemistries, and includes multicomponent diffusion and thermodiffusion. A two-step solution approach is used. In the first step, a lumped chemistry model {{is used to calculate}} the flame shape, temperatures and hydrodynamics. In the second step, a detailed, 27 species / 119 elementary reactions gas phase chemistry model and a 41 species / 67 elementary reactions surface chemistry model are used to calculate radicals and intermediates concentrations in the gas phase and at the surface, as well as growth rates. Important experimental trends are predicted correctly, but there are some discrepancies. The main problem lies {{in the use of the}} Miller–Melius hydrocarbon combustion mechanism for rich oxy-acetylene flames. [J. A. Miller and C. F. Melius, Combustion and Flame 91, 21 (1992) ]. Despite this problem, some aspects of the diamond growth process are clarified. It is demonstrated that gas-phase diffusion limitations play a minor role in the diamond growth process, which is determined by surface kinetics. Except for atomic hydrogen, gas phase diffusion is also of minor importance for the transport of species in and behind the flame front. Finally, it is shown that penetration of nitrogen from the ambient air into the flame cannot explain the observed changes at the center of the diamond films as reported in the literature. © 2000 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
