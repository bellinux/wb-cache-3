At home, Chippy suffers with a head cold, but Mrs. Hackee's lack of expression in the illustration leaves the reader wondering how she took his abrupt return. <b>One</b> <b>wonders</b> why Mrs. Hackee did not pursue Chippy once she learned of his whereabouts from a bird. After the reader discovers Goody is the happy mother of triplets and Timmy has made the decision to keep his nuts under lock and key, he may wonder what sort of fate the future holds for the Hackees.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest and}} most {{influential}} recording label of the time, The Victor Talking Machine (RCA Victor after 1928) was a restraining influence {{on the development of}} “sweet jazz” until the departure of Eddie King in October 1926. King was well known as an authoritarian who would not permit drinking on the job or severe departure from the written music, unless within solos acceptable by popular music standards of the time. This irritated many Victor jazz artists, including famed trumpeter Bix Beiderbecke. Sudhalter, in Lost Chords, cites an example of a 1927 recording by the Goldkette Orchestra in which musicians were allowed considerable freedom, and remarks “What, <b>one</b> <b>wonders,</b> would this performance have been if Eddie King had been in charge, and not the more liberal Nat Shilkret. Since the Victor ledgers show no less than five recording sessions in January and February 1926, when King actually conducted Goldkette’s Orchestra, comparison between the approach of Goldkette and King is readily available.|$|E

25|$|An {{examination}} of myth and symbol {{reveals that the}} work may be better understood as an internal drama of a conflicted modern man {{rather than as a}} representation of external reality in a failed utopia. The city is laid out as a mandala, populated with archetypes and subject to an archetypal conflict. <b>One</b> <b>wonders</b> if Zamyatin were familiar with the theories of his contemporary C. G. Jung or whether it is a case here of the common European zeitgeist.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} {{boundary of}} the fell is formed by the Whinlatter Pass road. The summit of the pass lies south east of Whinlatter Top, marking {{the line of the}} Derwent-Cocker watershed. This falls from Tarbarrel Moss to the road, bypassing the highest point of the fell so that all of its waters flow to the Cocker. From the road summit Whinlatter Beck runs westward beneath the steepest face of the fell, Whinlatter Crag being a little below the highest point. To the north of Whinlatter is the quiet valley of Aiken Beck, its entrance neatly hidden in the woods between Brown How and Graystones. Its tributaries Willybrag Gill and Drycloff Gill drain the slopes of the fell. <b>One</b> <b>wonders</b> at the derivation of the former name. Aiken Beck and Whinlatter Gill combine to form Blaze Beck, a sizeable stream flowing into the Cocker at Low Lorton.|$|E

500|$|The films {{also contain}} {{elements}} of visual humour: when Jaws is {{dropped into a}} shark pool in The Spy Who Loved Me, it is Jaws who bites the shark. The following film, Moonraker, sees Bond in a comic chase scene with a gondola that becomes a hovercraft, a continuation that Bond author Raymond Benson considered [...] "so dumb that <b>one</b> <b>wonders</b> at what age group the film was really aimed." [...] The music and sound effects are also used for comic effect in the films: the laboratory of Hugo Drax is opened by touchtones that play the tune of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, whilst when Bond and Anya are seen walking across the desert in The Spy Who Loved Me, the theme from Lawrence of Arabia is heard.|$|E
500|$|Motography {{included}} a {{brief review of}} the film which states, [...] "This is indeed a well presented historical subject. The action has breadth and historical perspective, with stirring scenes and large groupings, {{and at the same time}} there is a human plot threading its way through the historical background and giving the action a specific interest. The last scene, showing Santa Anna's surrender [...] "as a common soldier," [...] is rather obscure. <b>One</b> <b>wonders</b> why he did it. In all other scenes the action is clear and effective. It would be a stolid audience indeed that failed to respond to the thrilling scene inside the Alamo." [...] The Moving Picture Worlds review stated that [...] " [...] is a very thrilling and altogether satisfactory reproduction of an important historical episode. The company deserves the highest commendation for the picture and the way it is produced." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer and {{journalist}} J. Randy Taraborrelli {{wrote of the}} song in 2004, [...] " [...] remains among Michael's best songs... On listening to 'You Are Not Alone', <b>one</b> <b>wonders</b> how many times Michael tried to tell himself, during his most desperate and anguished times, that he did have support in his life, from a higher power, or even friends and family, whether he actually believed it or not". Fred Shuster of the Daily News of Los Angeles described it as the best song on the album. Conversely, while Steve Holsey of Michigan Chronicle gave the album a positive review, he described the song as the worst on the album, calling the Kelly penned lyrics [...] "" [...] and below the standard set by Jackson's own lyrical skills. [...] "You Are Not Alone" [...] received an American Music Award nomination and a Grammy nomination both for [...] "Best Pop Vocal Performance".|$|E

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Billboard considered that Bowie had [...] "found his musical niche" [...] following songs like [...] "Fame" [...] and [...] "Golden Years" [...] but that [...] "the 10-minute title cut drags", while NME called it [...] "one {{of the most}} significant albums released in the last five years", later naming it the second greatest album of the year. Both magazines found the meaning of the lyrics difficult to fathom. Rolling Stone writer Teri Moris applauded the album's 'rockier' moments but discerned a move away from the genre, finding it [...] "the thoughtfully professional effort of a style-conscious artist whose ability to write and perform demanding rock & roll exists comfortably alongside his fascination for diverse forms... while there's little doubt about his skill, <b>one</b> <b>wonders</b> how long he'll continue wrestling with rock at all". Circus, noting that Bowie was [...] "never one to maintain continuity in his work or in his life", declared that Station to Station [...] "offers cryptic, expressionistic glimpses that let us feel the contours and palpitations of the masquer's soul but never fully reveal his face." [...] The review also found various allusions to earlier Bowie efforts, such as the [...] "density" [...] of The Man Who Sold the World, the [...] "pop feel" [...] of Hunky Dory, the [...] "dissonance and angst" [...] of Aladdin Sane, the [...] "compelling percussion" [...] of Young Americans, and the [...] "youthful mysticism" [...] of [...] "Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud", concluding that [...] "it shows Bowie pulling out on the most challenging leg of his winding journey".|$|E
500|$|In the US, {{the film}} was not subject to any {{censorship}} at all, and was released virtually intact to AIP's usual mix of drive-ins and grindhouses. However, {{in an attempt to}} link the film with Roger Corman's earlier Edgar Allan Poe series of films, it was retitled The Conqueror Worm. Brief prologue and epilogue narrations (by Price) taken from Poe's poem were added to justify the new title. As Danny Peary noted in his Cult Movies book, the film went nearly unnoticed by critics during its US release: [...] "The few snoozing trade reviewers who saw it treated it as just another entry in AIP's Edgar Allan Poe series... and gave it such dismal notices that future bookings were scarce." [...] Hollywood Citizen News was appalled by the film: [...] "A disgrace to the producers and scripters, and a sad commentary on the art of filmmaking... a film with such bestial brutality and orgiastic sadism, <b>one</b> <b>wonders</b> how it ever passed customs to be released in this country." [...] The trade journal Box Office noted that: [...] "Fans of the horror film will be glad to know that Vincent Price is back to add another portrait to his gallery of arch-fiends... bathed in the most stomach-churning gore imaginable..." [...] Variety opined that [...] "Dwyer gives evidence of acting talent, but she and all principals are hampered by Michael Reeves's mediocre script and ordinary direction." [...] Despite the lack of critical support, the movie was a modest success stateside, earning $1.5 million for AIP according to Cinefantastique magazine. In his biography of Reeves, Benjamin Halligan claims the film made $10 million in the US.|$|E
500|$|Her first {{starring}} film {{role was}} in the 2007 horror–thriller P2, in which she played a businesswoman who becomes trapped inside a public parking garage with a deranged security guard. About the dress her character wears {{for much of the}} film, Nichols said, [...] "When I read the script originally, it wasn't a dress, it was a small nightgown with no bra or underwear. Then I read the first scene where she gets wet, and I went: 'OK, {{this has got to be}} altered! Nichols said in an interview that among the rules established in her contract were: [...] "I will not get wet and show nipples" [...] in addition to no nudity. A bra was sewn into the [...] "Marilyn Monroe dress" [...] she wore in the film. She said, [...] "I wasn't going to run around for two months without a bra, I thought that was inappropriate. But in place of the nipples there's clearly a lot of cleavage. So we made a compromise." [...] P2 was generally disliked by critics. Reviewer James Berardinelli said that her performance was [...] "admirable, although <b>one</b> <b>wonders</b> whether she was cast more for her physical assets than her acting ability." [...] John Anderson of Variety wrote that [...] "Nichols is in territory well trod over the years by everyone from Fay Wray and Grace Kelly to Heather Langenkamp, the terrified but gutsy heroine, who in this case has been chloroformed and put into a sheer white evening dress by her abductor—who must have anticipated that his captive would try to escape in an elevator, which he could then fill with water. (Nichols' considerable physical attributes, henceforth, seem to occupy most of the screen.) She's sympathetic, hysterical when required and likeable." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is {{generally}} {{acknowledged that the}} work of Crone and Cook was a fresh approach in its reconstruction of early Islamic history, but the theory has been almost universally rejected. Van Ess has dismissed it stating that [...] "a refutation is perhaps unnecessary since the authors make no effort to prove it in detail ... Where they are only giving a new interpretation of well-known facts, this is not decisive. But where the accepted facts are consciously put upside down, their approach is disastrous." [...] R. B.
