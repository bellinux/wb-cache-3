5000|$|The first {{detailed}} appreciation <b>of</b> <b>Cornell's</b> film-making {{activity in}} print {{was an article}} by Jonas Mekas, [...] "The Invisible Cathedrals of Joseph Cornell," [...] published in the Village Voice in 1970.

Anthology Film Archives maintains two programs <b>of</b> <b>Cornell's</b> films {{as part of its}} rotating Essential Cinema series; they have been widely seen in film series and as part of traveling exhibitions and collected onto the DVDs shown below.

5|$|In 1948, the Legislature placed all state-funded higher {{education}} {{into the new}} State University of New York (SUNY). Cornell's four statutory colleges (agriculture, human ecology, labor relations and veterinary medicine) have been affiliated with SUNY since its inception, but {{did not have any}} such state affiliation prior to that time. Statutory college employees legally are employees <b>of</b> <b>Cornell,</b> not employees of SUNY. The State Education Law gives the SUNY Board of Trustees the authority to approve Cornell's appointment of the deans/unit heads of the statutory colleges, and control of the level of state funding for the statutory colleges.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, Charles Horton Peck had {{reported}} A.phalloides in North America. In 1918, samples from the eastern United States were identified as being a distinct though similar species, A. brunnescens, by G. F. Atkinson <b>of</b> <b>Cornell</b> University. By the 1970s, it had become clear that A.phalloides does occur in the United States, apparently having been introduced from Europe alongside chestnuts, with populations on the West and East Coasts. Although a 2006 historical review concluded the East Coast populations were introduced, the origins of the West Coast populations remained unclear, due to scant historical records. A 2009 genetic study provided strong evidence for the introduced status of the fungus on the west coast of North America.|$|E
5|$|During Danziger's tenure, {{assistant}} rabbis included Alan Greenbaum (1977–1981), Harry Rosenfeld (1981–1984), Constance Abramson Golden—Temple Israel's {{first female}} rabbi—(1984–1986), and Marc Belgrad (1986–1991). Micah D. Greenstein, {{the son of}} rabbi Howard Greenstein, succeeded Belgrad as assistant rabbi in 1991, and was subsequently promoted to associate rabbi. A graduate <b>of</b> <b>Cornell</b> University and the John F. Kennedy School of Government, he was ordained by the HUC. On Danziger's retirement in 2000, he became senior rabbi. An advocate for social justice, he tried to convince the Shelby County Commission {{to pass a law}} forbidding discrimination against LGBT people, and has used the Bible to present counter-arguments to those supporting such discrimination based on biblical verses. He has served twice as president of the Memphis Ministers Association, and sits on the boards of several local non-profit organizations.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the average American may be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the middle or working class. The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member of the middle class. Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as middle class, yet some experts in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert <b>of</b> <b>Cornell</b> University have brought forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the average American may be described as being either or both, lower middle and working class.|$|E

5|$|No longer {{known by}} the BGCR name, the route meanders north, slowly edging east towards Reesor Road and now {{surrounded}} by undeveloped greenspace. It encounters Highway7, north of which it becomes a divided roadway travelling on the eastern edge <b>of</b> <b>Cornell</b> as well as parallel to and alongside Reesor Road. Approaching and intersecting 16th Avenue, the road makes a broad sweeping curve northwest, continuing {{to serve as the}} boundary of urban development in Markham. It narrows to a two lane road, with adjacent land along the northern side prepared for future northbound lanes, before encountering Ninth Line again. Quickly curving north then east, sandwiched between the neighbourhood of Greenborough and Little Rouge Creek, the route makes a final curve north to end at Major Mackenzie Drive on the northern edge of urban development in eastern Markham.|$|E
5|$|This {{family of}} white horses {{produced}} Old King in 1908, a dark-eyed white stallion that {{was purchased by}} Caleb R. and Hudson B. Thompson. Old King was bred to Morgan mares to produce a breed of horse known today as the American White Horse. A grandson of Old King, Snow King, {{was at the center}} of the first major study of the dominant white coat color in horses, conducted in 1969 by Dr. William L. Pulos of Alfred University and Dr. Frederick B. Hutt <b>of</b> <b>Cornell.</b> They concluded, based on test matings and progeny phenotype ratios, that the white coat was dominantly inherited and embryonic lethal in the homozygous state. Other factors, such as variations in expressivity and the influence of multiple genes, may have influenced the progeny ratios that Pulos and Hutt observed. The white coat of the American White Horse has not yet been mapped.|$|E

He graduated magna cum laude with high honors in mathematics receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics and Chemistry. Fischbach was also elected a member of Colgate University’s Phi Beta Kappa chapter in 1960. After graduating from Colgate University, Fischbach attended Weill Cornell Medical College <b>of</b> <b>Cornell</b> University, {{where he was}} a recipient of the New York State Medical Scholarship from 1962 to 1965 and the Polk Award for Undergraduate Research in 1965, before graduating with his M.D. that same year. Additionally, Fischbach received an honorary master's degree from Harvard University in 1978 and an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Colgate University in 2003. After graduating medical school, Fischbach interned at the University of Washington hospital in Seattle, Washington before beginning his research career at the National Institutes of Health in 1966. Fischbach is married to Ruth L. Fischbach, who currently serves as a Professor of Bioethics in Psychiatry at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. They have four children.|$|E

5|$|Gerald D. Fischbach (born November 15, 1938) is an American neuroscientist. He {{received}} his M.D. from the Weill Cornell Medical College <b>of</b> <b>Cornell</b> University in 1965 before beginning his research {{career at the}} National Institutes of Health in 1966, where his research focused on the mechanisms of neuromuscular junctions. After his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach was a professor at Harvard University Medical School from 1972–1981 and 1990–1998 and the Washington University School of Medicine from 1981–1990. In 1998, he was named {{the director of the}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke before becoming the Vice President and Dean of the Health and Biomedical Sciences, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, and the Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences at Columbia University from 2001–2006. Gerald Fischbach currently serves as the scientific director overseeing the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative. Throughout Fischbach's career, much of his research has focused on the formation and function of the neuromuscular junction, which stemmed from his innovative use of cell culture to study synaptic mechanisms.|$|E

25|$|The {{statutory}} colleges at <b>Cornell</b> {{grew out}} <b>of</b> <b>Cornell's</b> designation in 1865 as New York State's land grant college under the Morrill Act. Under the Morrill Act, Cornell received land scrip {{based on the}} population of the state, and the proceeds formed the basis <b>of</b> <b>Cornell's</b> initial endowment. Under the terms <b>of</b> the <b>Cornell's</b> 1865 charter from the Legislature, Cornell was obligated to teach agriculture, mechanical arts and military tactic. (Cornell was also obligated to provide free tuition to students from each assembly district.) By the 1890s, Cornell sought state funding to continue its mission in these areas, and the statutory colleges were formed as a vehicle for direct state funding. In addition, around the start of the 20th century, new federal laws provided land-grant colleges (and their agricultural experiment stations and cooperative extension services) with annual funding conditioned upon matching state funds. As a result, almost all <b>of</b> <b>Cornell's</b> land grant duties were transferred to its four statutory colleges, which receive such state funds through the present.|$|R
