30|$|Although {{attitudes towards}} money {{can have a}} certain link to {{economic}} practices, we note that it is above all certain control variables that have a considerable effect. Income level has a strongly positive influence on the capacity to save, as does {{the composition of the}} household. Young people living with their two parents have a much higher savings capacity, which perhaps also explains why their propensity to incur debts, to have <b>overdue</b> <b>bills</b> or to take out leasing is much lower than that of those living alone or as a couple. We also note that a tertiary level of education considerably reduces the risks of contracting debt, taking out leasing or having <b>overdue</b> <b>bills,</b> which is consistent with {{the results of the study}} conducted by the FSO (Christin, 2012; Fleury and Christin, 2015).|$|R
5000|$|Not long afterwards, the PLN was {{involved}} in an incident in the Central Java city of Surakarta where the municipality had <b>overdue</b> <b>bills</b> owing of close to $1 million (Rp 8.9 billion) to the PLN. Following PLN company policy to pursue a more aggressive approach to collect <b>overdue</b> <b>bills,</b> the PLN imposed a blackout on street lamps in Surakarta just before Christmas 2011. The city municipality quickly arranged payment but arranged the settlement along with a protest and suggested that the PLN should consider {{the interest of the}} public before taking this type of action. To reinforce the point, the mayor of Surakarta, Joko Widodo, made a highly publicised personal visit to the local PLN office to deliver the Rp 8.9 billion in cash in the form of hundreds of bundles of notes and coin.|$|R
50|$|David R. Thorne (born 23 February 1972) is an Australian humourist, satirist, and Internet personality. His {{work has}} been {{featured}} on the BBC, the Late Show with David Letterman, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Thorne gained public recognition in late 2008 for an email exchange in which he attempts to pay an <b>overdue</b> <b>bill</b> with a drawing of a seven-legged spider. The exchange spread virally via email and social networking sites, leading to a surge of visitors to his website 27b/6 (27bslash6). 27b/6 features a collection of humorous emails and articles from Thorne's life. These and additional essays appear in Thorne's book, The Internet is a Playground.

30|$|No money {{attitude}} significantly {{influences the}} savings behaviours, 12 which confirms the results by Carroll et al. (1994, 1999); cultural money attitudes {{seem to have}} no significant effects on savings. In our case, this result {{can be attributed to}} the fact that saving is a behaviour largely practised by our respondents (69.9 % of them usually put money aside every month, see Fig.  2) and more generally by the entire Swiss population (OECD, 2015). Inversely, we observe a significant relation between attitudes towards money and indebtedness, and between the type of debts (<b>overdue</b> <b>bill(s)</b> or leasing). 13 A high score on the prestige–power attitude axis increases the tendency to contract debts (odds ratio of 1.16) and to have <b>overdue</b> <b>bill(s)</b> (1.22), which is consistent with our hypotheses and with earlier research on compulsive buying (Roberts and Jones, 2001; Roberts and Sepulveda, 1999). From another angle, the fact of being sensitive to economical management attitudes diminishes the risks of having <b>overdue</b> <b>bills</b> (0.74), which we can explain by the fact that the individuals concerned probably have sufficient foresight to pay their bills in time. It is interesting, however, to note that this attitude does not have a link to savings, no doubt because—as we have already said—the practice of saving is widespread in Switzerland. It is also important to note that the goal-oriented attitude has no significant effect on either of the economic outcomes examined.|$|R

Following the electric company's policy of pursuing a more disciplined approach to collecting <b>overdue</b> <b>bills,</b> it imposed a blackout on street lights in Surakarta just before Christmas. The city government quickly authorized payment but in settling the bill protested that the PLN should consider the public interest before taking this type of action.

30|$|Third, our {{research}} {{also contributes to}} the culture and finance literature by documenting the link between culture and economic outcomes. It identifies a relation between cultural attitude towards money and financial practices. It nevertheless also reveals that this relation varies {{depending on the type}} of practices concerned, which seems to confirm previous research on saving and credit card use (Carroll et al. 1994, 1999; Roberts and Jones, 2001; Roberts and Sepulveda, 1999). We show that there is, above all, a link with indebtedness. The prestige–power attitude can be related to the presence of debts and leasing contracts, and the economical management attitude has a negative impact on the presence of <b>overdue</b> <b>bills.</b>|$|R
40|$|Customer churn {{has been}} stated {{as one of}} the main reasons of {{profitability}} losses in the telecommunications industry. As such, it seems critical to have an a priori knowledge about the risk of a given customer to churn at any moment, in order to take preventive measures to avoid the defection of potentially profitable customers. This study intends to develop a duration model of the residential customer churn in this industry in Portugal. We found empirical evidence that the variables that influence customer churn are the total number of <b>overdue</b> <b>bills</b> since ever, average monthly spending, average value of additional internet traffic, payment method, equipment renting, and the subscription of a flat plan. We also found that the probability of a customer to churn is neither constant over time nor across customers...|$|R

But little as she might know about money, Mrs. Cox did know this--that when poverty comes in at the door, love flies out at the window; that eating and drinking are stern necessities; that love in a cottage is supposed to be, what she would call, bosh; and that her own old home used to be very unpleasant when Cox was in debt, and those eastern Jewish harpies would come down upon him with his <b>overdue</b> <b>bills.</b> Considering all this, Mrs. Cox thought it might be well not to ratify her engagement with Mr. Bertram till after they should reach Southampton.

40|$|Africa has a {{high rate}} of revenue under-collection in public water utility companies. This rate {{currently}} averages 20 - 50 %, and the rate is 18 % for Malawi alone. The purpose of this single-case study was to explore credible business strategies senior managers of water utilities use to address inefficiencies in collecting water fee revenues. The conceptual framework for this study was revenue management, which includes strategic constructs for increasing amounts of revenue collection. The target population for this study was 5 senior managers of a public water utility in Malawi, which is located in the southeastern part of Africa. Data collection included semistructured, face-to-face interviews and a review of company documents. The data analysis process involved the use of thematic analysis, including methodological triangulation, to identify 4 themes: innovative strategies, effective metering and billing, customer relationship management, and disconnection of water supply from customers with <b>overdue</b> <b>bills.</b> These themes highlighted credible business strategies that, for these 5 senior managers, were effective in revenue collection. Addressing inefficiencies in collecting water fee revenues will facilitate positive social change by increasing profits, growing the water business, reducing the crime rate by employing more people, providing potable water to reduce waterborne diseases, and contributing to the sustainable social and economic development of the people of Malawi...|$|R

Moreover, the landline is cut off because of <b>overdue</b> <b>bills.</b> Paulette is desperate to earn money somehow and she hears there is much money to be made in dealing cannabis. She visits a known criminal named Vito in her area and asks him for work. He commissions her eventually to sell his cannabis. Yet the other dealers don't put up with her unexpected success. They beat her up and rob her. Again she is desperate because she has to deliver {{a certain amount of money}} to Vito. Instead of just distributing sheer cannabis she starts to sell cakes and biscuits spiced with cannabis. Soon there is a huge demand for her elaborate pastries. Vito's boss gets enthusiastic about her success and plans to sell her biscuits to pupils. When she refuses to support this idea, the villain kidnaps Paulette's grandson. She starts a spectacular attempt to free him but in the end it is her son-in-law Ousmane who saves the day. Finally she leaves France and opens a cannabis coffee shop in Amsterdam, hereby becoming herself the kind of person she used to dislike: an emigrant.|$|R
