The Sea of Japan was patrolled by the Imperial Japanese Navy day and night. If {{there was any}} Soviet Navy {{presence}} on those waters, the Japanese would {{have been aware of}} it. Since Japan and the Soviet Union were neutral up until the Soviets' declaration of war on Japan in August 1945, the Port of Vladivostok and <b>other</b> <b>seaports</b> in the Soviet Union were constantly watched by Japanese observers based in their own held territories in Manchuria, Korea, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands.|$|E

By these three towns, I mean the city of Norwich, the towns of Yarmouth and Lynn. Besides that, it has several <b>other</b> <b>seaports</b> of very good trade, as Wisbech, Wells, Burnham, Clye, etc.|$|E

50|$|Although several {{statutes}} of Edward I and Edward III, notably their confirmations of Magna Carta, {{had made}} it illegal for the Crown to exact any taxes {{without the consent of}} Parliament, the prerogative of levying ship money in time of war had never fallen wholly into abeyance.

60|$|Hamburg was at {{that time}} the resort of many desperate men from England. After Worcester, as after the {{crushing}} out of the first civil war, those too deeply committed {{to return to their homes}} sought refuge here. But though all professed to be Cavaliers, who were suffering only from their loyalty to the crown, a great many of them were men who had no just claim to so honorable a position. There were many who took advantage of the times in England to satisfy private enmities or to gratify evil passions. Although the courts of law sat during the whole of the civil war, and the judges made their circuits, there was necessarily far more crime than in ordinary times. Thus many of those who betook themselves to Hamburg and <b>other</b> <b>seaports</b> on the continent had made England too hot for them by crimes of violence and dishonesty.|$|E

It seems, from what they said, that the governor has had letters that seemed to confirm the news that several regiments are on the march south; and that stores are being collected at Cadiz, and some of the <b>other</b> <b>seaports.</b> There is nothing, as far as we know, specially said about Gibraltar; but what else can they be getting ready for, unless it is to cross the Straits and attack the Moors--and they are at peace with them, at present, just as they are with us? I mean to think that they are coming here, till we are downright sure they are not. The news is so good, I mean to believe that it is true, as long as I can." ...|$|E
60|$|Louis meekly {{suffered}} the reproach. He had, in his submission, made over his judgment and {{authority to the}} papal legates--men far less fit than he to exercise power--and matters went chiefly as they and his fiery brothers chose to direct. Wiser counsellors recommended securing the <b>other</b> <b>seaport,</b> Alexandria; but Prince Alfonse declared, {{that the only way}} to kill a snake, was to strike the head, and persuaded the council that the move should be upon Grand Cairo, or, as the Crusaders chose to call it, Babylon.|$|R
60|$|In 1847 a British {{consulate}} was established, Mr. Plowden being {{selected for}} the post. He unfortunately committed the great error of entering into friendly relations with the potentate of Amhara, {{in place of the}} independent chief of Tigre, who, possessing the only outlet of communication, rendered an alliance with Amhara completely nugatory to both parties. Mr. Plowden himself, when too late, seems to have discovered that he had committed an error, and wrote to the Earl of Clarendon, who was then Foreign Secretary, that he feared that little commercial advantage could be obtained. His lordship replied that, having made the treaty and established the consulate, her Majesty’s Government were reluctant to renounce all hope of benefit, and begged him to suggest some plan of establishing himself at Massowah or some <b>other</b> <b>seaport,</b> and of keeping up a communication with the interior.|$|R
60|$|Toulon, {{republican in}} principle, having taken its {{decision}} {{in a moment}} under the guillotine, and {{before the arrival of}} these commissioners,--Toulon, being a place regularly fortified, and having in its bosom a navy in part highly discontented, has escaped, though by a sort of miracle: and it would not have escaped, if two powerful fleets had not been at the door, to give them not only strong, but prompt and immediate succor, especially as neither this nor any <b>other</b> <b>seaport</b> town in France can be depended on, from the peculiarly savage dispositions, manners, and connections among the lower sort of people in those places. This I take to be the true state of things in France, so far as it regards any existing bodies, whether of legal or voluntary association, capable of acting or of treating in corps.|$|R

50|$|Ship {{traffic at}} Eilat is {{relatively}} low (compared to Israel's two large seaports on the Mediterranean).

Another is the fact that unlike the country's <b>other</b> main <b>seaports,</b> Eilat's is yet to be served by a railway line (the nearest railhead is located hundreds of kilometers to the north).

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "More than 3 years {{after the terrorist attacks}} of September 11, 2001, concerns remain over the security of U. S. seaports and waterways. Seaports and waterways are vulnerable given their size, easy accessibility by water and land, large numbers of potential targets, and close proximity to urban areas. Seaports are also a critical link in the international supply chain, which has its own potential vulnerabilities that terrorists could exploit to transport {{a weapon of mass destruction}} to the United States. Federal agencies such as the Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection and <b>other</b> <b>seaport</b> stakeholders such as state and local law enforcement officials as well as owners and operators of facilities and vessels have taken actions to try to mitigate these vulnerabilities and enhance maritime security. This testimony, which is based on previously completed GAO work, reports on (1) the types of actions taken by the federal government and other stakeholders to address maritime security, (2) the main challenges that GAO observed in taking these actions, and (3) what tools and approaches may be useful in planning future actions to enhance maritime security. ...|$|R

50|$|As a {{strategic}} and military outpost for the British, the sea lanes off the Straits of Malacca {{were important to}} be kept free from pirates and open for shipping. As the British expanded in influence and power, so Singapore stood in the gap between East and West interests as a natural deep-harbour destination that played host to the French, Portuguese, Dutch and other European navies and their men. <b>Other</b> <b>seaports</b> in Asia, from Shanghai to Calcutta, {{also played a role}} in the traffic of women and girls for prostitution.|$|E

50|$|Hanko is {{the southernmost}} town in Finland.

40|$|Measuring {{capacity}} and capacity utilisation at seaport terminals {{is essential to}} ensure efficient utilisation of the infra- and superstructure of the seaport. Most of the methods that have so far been used to measure capacity utilisation {{are not easy to}} comprehend for a common seaport operator. Most of the methods are also data intensive and therefore not suited for developing countries. This article attempts to use well-known standard queuing models to measure capacity utilisation in a seaport using the seaport of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) as a case study. Historical data on terminal performance for the general cargo and the container terminal have been collected to validate the model. Based on standard queuing models it has been found that terminal capacity for both terminals is being underutilised and that, as a result, ships are being subjected to unnecessarily long waiting times; a conclusion backed up by a more detailed simulation model. Although some assumptions on which common queuing models have been derived may not hold true in practice, it is argued that standard queuing models {{can be used as a}} quick scan for evaluating seaport terminal capacity utilisation. If accurate measurement is needed, more data may need to be collected to determine the actual ship arrivals and service time distributions and develop an appropriate simulation model. The methodology developed in this article, although validated using port performance data for the port of Dar es Salaam, is directly applicable to any <b>other</b> <b>seaport.</b> © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd...|$|R
