I come here green {{with only a}} desire to make our great country even greater. We have much work to do. In that spirit, I pledge to each <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope that I never lose the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look forward to getting to know you better.|$|E

[...] In an interview, Gaga pointed {{out that in the}} verse, [...] "I want your psycho, your vertigo shtick, Want you in my Rear Window, Baby, you're sick", she was listing Alfred Hitchcock films; she said, [...] "What I'm really trying to say is I want the deepest, darkest, sickest parts <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> you are afraid to share with anyone because I love you that much." ...|$|E

I need only that happiness for the rest of my life. And it is with that pride and arrogance that I give my permission for my sister to marry." ...|$|E
500|$|Armitage {{performs}} his own stunts. When performing fight scenes, {{they would}} be choreographed carefully so Armitage could take part rather than a stunt double. For series eight, Armitage performed a fight scene in a swimming pool, which he thought was [...] "fun," [...] but also thought it was difficult as it was [...] "like acting and punching in slow motion." [...] In another sequence, he injured a stuntman with a hospital trolley. He was only given a short lesson {{on how to handle}} firearms, since he was already accustomed to using them whilst working on Ultimate Force. While discussing the shootout at the end of series seven, Armitage noted that he is [...] "not a violent person but when you put a gun in somebody's hands [...] it's like a little animal comes out <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> wants to fire the gun again." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the video's premiere on MTV, Gaga {{explained}} {{some of the}} its {{scenes and}} her inspiration: [...] "The video is quite complex {{in the way that}} the story is told, and it's meant to be slightly linear and slightly twisted and confusing, which is the way that love is." [...] Regarding the sexual intercourse scenes between actor Taylor Kinney and the singer as a mermaid, Gaga explained that it emphasized metaphorically that sometimes relationships did not work. [...] "No matter what you do, there's this giant boundary between you and someone else. So that's what it's about, perceiving in your imagination that there's something magical inside <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> you can make it work," [...] she said. After revealing that the wedding dress shown in the video belonged to her mother, Gaga explained the scenes involving the ice cream truck. According to her, they represented the destruction of her youth, experiences she had shared in earlier interviews. Explaining her decision to include them, Gaga said: ...|$|E
500|$|After {{enduring}} {{three years}} of [...] "carping" [...] from critics, Carey planned her return to music. On November 18, 2004, she revealed on her website that {{the name of the}} album would be The Emancipation of Mimi. While Carey was recording the album, Island Records executive L.A. Reid had learned that close friends referred to the singer as [...] "Mimi". He had told Carey, [...] "I feel your spirit on this record. You should use that name in the title, because that's the fun side <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> people don't get to see – the side that can laugh at the diva jokes, laugh at the breakdown jokes, laugh at whatever they want to say about you and just live life and enjoy it." [...] Carey explained that Mimi is a [...] "very personal nickname" [...] only used by those in her inner circle, and thus the title meant she was letting her guard down and inviting her fans to be that much closer to her. She thought that naming her album The Emancipation of Mariah Carey would be [...] "obnoxious".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{sometime}} during Summer 2008. Miller wanted to style the filming {{as if the}} cameras are following the team like in a documentary. The first day was spent in the [...] "Ottawa Bravo" [...] safe house set, where Connie reveals the threat. Throughout the shoot, Gemma Jones had hip problems. Concerned, the producers set up a body double on hand. However, Jones insisted she could do everything herself, {{and in the end}} the double was not used. During the first shootout scene in the episode, Miller wanted to make the sequence as real as possible by having the camera film as if it was under attack. Richard Armitage recalled the shootout sequence; [...] "There was a shoot-out in the final episode where I surprised myself about the amount of rounds I could pull off and how quickly. It's a weird thing. I'm not a violent person but when you put a gun in somebody's hands something strange happens. It's like a little animal comes out <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> wants to fire the gun again." ...|$|E

500|$|Kelly {{understands that}} co-writing with other songwriters lends power to his songs. [...] "You often write songs with {{collaborators}} {{that you would}} never write by yourself. It's a way of dragging a song out <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> you wouldn't have come up with". One of his collaborators, Linda Bull, described Kelly's process: they would start with a simple chat. [...] "We'd just chuck ideas around and he'd pick the best bits. He'd take all the bluntness and crudeness {{out of it and}} make it beautiful; that's his magic ... It's conversations that you have [...] ". Forster summarised his 2009 review of Kelly's compilation, Songs from the South, with [...] " [...] sound easy and approachable ... Then you think: If the songs are so simple and the ideas behind them so clear, why aren't more people writing like Paul Kelly and sounding as good as he does?" [...] In 2010 Carmody and Kelly's [...] "From Little Things Big Things Grow" [...] was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia Registry.|$|E
500|$|Manos Arriba {{consists}} of five tracks. The EP opens with [...] "No Me Mandes Flores" [...] ("Don't Send Me Flowers"), which Agustin Gurza called a [...] "cold kiss-off to a stubborn ex-lover". The second track [...] "A Veces" [...] ("At Times") deals with jealousy, and features salsa horns and tropical influences. The following song [...] "La Duda" [...] ("The Doubt") centers on confusion over a man sending mixed romantic signals; the lyrics {{are accompanied by}} synthesizers. On the fourth track, [...] "Icaro" [...] ("Icarus"), Chana sings about {{the subject of the}} Greek myth. Rather than criticizing Icarus for his hubris, her lyrics have a more positive interpretation that praises his desire to follow his passions despite the risks. Chana identifies closely with Icarus, saying: [...] "I would rather take the risk and fall on my butt. It's about that part <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> says just do it." [...] The EP concludes with [...] "The Whistler", which mocks the practice of catcalling. In his verses, rapper Malverde assumes the role of a cat-caller.|$|E
500|$|Alex Timbers {{developed}} {{the concept and}} directed the play, while Kyle Jarrow wrote the accompanying book, music, and lyrics. [...] Timbers and Jarrow were classmates together at Yale University. [...] The script for the play is published by Samuel French, Inc. [...] Jarrow was motivated to write the script {{by what he saw}} as a shift in religious teachings – from an old model involving hell and retribution, to a new system of thought promising money or peace. [...] Jarrow commented on Timbers' idea of using children to tell a story about Scientology: [...] "I did a lot of work on cults in college, and what I learned is that they sort of turn you into a child by appealing to that part <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> wants {{to be taken care of}} and given answers. [...] And so it all began to make sense to me." [...] He said Scientology would be [...] "an especially interesting topic for a theater piece" [...] because of its criticism of psychiatry, relative newness compared to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, and practice of requiring [...] "that the follower take courses which cost significant amounts of money." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ray Bradbury {{once said}} of Chaney, [...] "He {{was someone who}} acted out our psyches.

He brings <b>that</b> part <b>of</b> <b>you</b> out into the open, because <b>you</b> fear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not loved, <b>you</b> fear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> never will be loved, you fear there is some part <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that's</b> grotesque, that the world will turn away from." ...|$|R

"Mongrels friends, {{it is my}} unbearably sad duty to {{announce}} {{that we will not}} be returning for a third series on BBC Three, a decision that has been made {{based on the fact that}} apparently you need more than two people watching a programme to make it successful. Crazy talk. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at BBC Comedy, BBC Three and BBC Worldwide who have supported us so strongly over the years, and helped us put our silly puppet show on the digital screens of the nation. I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not be less of a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank those <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> loved watching Mongrels as much as we loved making it. It's wonderfully reassuring to think that we weren't mad after all, and that what we find funny, other people do too. I'd like to believe that there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there. Who knows, maybe we'll find a that room in the future. I hope it has a minibar. Thank you for watching. Both of you." ...|$|E
500|$|On 21 March 1816, {{at the age}} {{of seven}} years, Mendelssohn was baptised with his brother and sisters in a home {{ceremony}} by Johann Jakob Stegemann, minister of the Evangelical congregation of Berlin's Jerusalem Church and New Church. Although Mendelssohn was a conforming Christian {{as a member of the}} Reformed Church, he was both conscious and proud of his Jewish ancestry and notably of his connection with his grandfather Moses Mendelssohn. He was the prime mover in proposing to the publisher Heinrich Brockhaus a complete edition of Moses's works, which continued with the support of his uncle Joseph Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn was notably reluctant, either in his letters or conversation, to comment on his innermost beliefs; his friend Devrient wrote that [...] " [...] deep convictions were never uttered in intercourse with the world; only in rare and intimate moments did they ever appear, and then only in the slightest and most humorous allusions". Thus for example in a letter to his sister Rebecka, Mendelssohn rebukes her complaint about an unpleasant relative: [...] "What do you mean by saying you are not hostile to Jews? I hope this was a joke It is really sweet <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> you do not despise your family, isn't it?" [...] Some modern scholars have devoted considerable energy to demonstrate either that Mendelssohn was deeply sympathetic to his ancestors' Jewish beliefs, or that he was hostile to this and sincere in his Christian beliefs.|$|E
2500|$|Parker {{stated that}} [...] "The Less I Know the Better" [...] "shouldn't be on a Tame Impala album {{because it has}} this dorky, white disco funk." [...] "'Cause I'm a Man" [...] {{attracted}} controversy upon its release due to perceived sexism in its lyrics, but Parker meant the opposite: [...] "The song is about how weak men are basically, and how we make all these excuses." [...] "New Person, Same Old Mistakes" [...] closes the record, and expresses self-doubt. Parker said, [...] "The last song is meant to sound like the final battle between optimism and pessimism, a confrontation between the side <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> wants to progress and the side <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> wants to stay the same." ...|$|E

2500|$|Currents {{has also}} been {{frequently}} characterised as a breakup album. Prior to recording, Parker {{made the decision to}} break up with French singer-songwriter Melody Prochet. Several songs on the album examine it from his angle as the instigator of the breakup, which consists of guilt and self-questioning. Parker downplayed the notion that the album was entirely aimed at former lovers, however, and likened it to an inner monologue: [...] "It's really me talking to myself, another part of myself... to my old self, the part of me that resists change and wants me to stay as I am." [...] For Parker, the album meant [...] "looking forward and a sudden adoption of confidence." [...] The album's title reflects this, with currents being [...] "these unstoppable forces; the parts <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> are trying to change you." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Jones began deriding {{traditional}} Christianity as [...] "fly away religion", rejecting the Bible {{as being a}} tool to oppress women and non-whites, and denouncing a [...] "Sky God" [...] who was no God at all. Jones wrote a booklet titled [...] "The Letter Killeth", criticizing the King James Bible. Jones also began preaching {{that he was the}} reincarnation of Gandhi, Father Divine, Jesus, Gautama Buddha and Vladimir Lenin. Former Temple member Hue Fortson, Jr. quoted Jones as saying, [...] "What you need to believe in is what you can see... If you see me as your friend, I'll be your friend. As you see me as your father, I'll be your father, for those <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> don't have a father... If you see me as your savior, I'll be your savior.

[...] He called the PlayStation 3 version, [...] "a rushed and flawed port of a game made for a {{significantly}} weaker system." [...] He was also critical of the PlayStation Move control, preferring the DualShock. He concluded [...] "Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest is a fun and satisfying, if just a tad repetitive, action adventure with good fan service to those <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> love the Tolkien novels and Peter Jackson films." [...] He scored the PS2, PSP and DS versions 5 out of 10, criticising the [...] "mindless button-mashing action that feels {{more in line with}} a game like Gauntlet, but with only one character to control, no multiplayer, and incredibly shallow action mechanics." ...|$|E
