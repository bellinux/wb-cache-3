5|$|At a {{pressure}} of 55GPa (roughly 540,000 times atmospheric pressure) bromine undergoes an insulator-to-metal transition. At 75GPa it changes to a face-centered <b>orthorhombic</b> structure. At 100GPa it changes to a body centered <b>orthorhombic</b> monatomic form.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium(III) {{fluoride}} (BkF3) {{is also a}} yellow-green solid, but it has two crystalline structures. The {{most stable}} phase at low temperatures has an <b>orthorhombic</b> symmetry, isotypic with yttrium(III) fluoride (Pearson symbol oP16, space group Pnma, No. 62, a = 670 pm, b = 709 pm, c = 441 pm). Upon heating to 350 to 600 °C, it transforms to a trigonal structure found in lanthanum(III) fluoride (Pearson symbol hP24, space group Pc1, No. 165, a = 697 pm, c = 714 pm).|$|E
5|$|Fluorine has two solid forms, α- and β-fluorine. The latter {{crystallizes}} at −220°C (−364°F) and is {{transparent and}} soft, {{with the same}} disordered cubic structure of freshly crystallized solid oxygen, unlike the <b>orthorhombic</b> systems of other solid halogens. Further cooling to −228°C (−378°F) induces a phase transition into opaque and hard α-fluorine, which has a monoclinic structure with dense, angled layers of molecules. The transition from β- to α-fluorine is more exothermic than the condensation of fluorine, and can be violent.|$|E
5|$|Like solid bromine and iodine, solid {{chlorine}} crystallises in the <b>orthorhombic</b> crystal system, in a layered lattice of Cl2 molecules. The Cl–Cl {{distance is}} 198pm (close to the gaseous Cl–Cl distance of 199pm) and the Cl···Cl distance between molecules is 332pm within a layer and 382pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of chlorine, 180pm). This structure means that chlorine {{is a very}} poor conductor of electricity, and indeed its conductivity is so low as to be practically unmeasurable.|$|E
5|$|The element has two {{crystalline}} forms under 1 {{standard atmosphere}} of pressure: a double-hexagonal close-packed form dubbed alpha (α) and a face-centered cubic form designated beta (β). The α form exists below 600–800°C with a density of 15.10 g/cm3 and the β form exists above 600–800°C with a density of 8.74 g/cm3. At 48GPa of pressure the β form changes into an <b>orthorhombic</b> crystal system due to delocalization of the atom's 5f electrons, which frees them to bond.|$|E
5|$|Two {{forms of}} {{berkelium}}(III) bromide are known, a monoclinic with berkelium coordination 6 and <b>orthorhombic</b> with coordination 8; {{the latter is}} less stable and transforms to the former phase upon heating to about 350 °C. An important phenomenon for radioactive solids has been studied for these two crystal forms: the structures of fresh and aged 249BkBr3 samples were studied using X-ray diffraction over a period longer than 3 years, so that various fractions of 249Bk had beta decayed to 249Cf. No change in structure was observed upon the 249BkBr3—249CfBr3 transformation, even though the <b>orthorhombic</b> bromide was previously unknown for californium. However, other differences were noted for 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3. For example, the latter could be reduced with hydrogen to249CfBr2, but the former could be not – this result was reproduced on individual 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3 samples, as well on the samples containing both bromides. The intergrowth of californium in berkelium occurs {{at a rate of}} 0.22% per day and is an intrinsic obstacle in studying berkelium properties. Besides a chemical contamination, 249Cf, as an alpha emitter brings undesirable self-damage of the crystal lattice due to the resulting self-heating. This can be avoided by performing measurements as a function of time and extrapolating the obtained results.|$|E
5|$|Visible {{amounts of}} berkelium(III) {{chloride}} (BkCl3) were first isolated and characterized in 1962, and weighed only 3 billionths of a gram. It {{can be prepared}} by introducing hydrogen chloride vapors into an evacuated quartz tube containing berkelium oxide at a temperature about 500°C. This green solid has a melting point of 600°C, and is isotypic with uranium(III) chloride. Upon heating to nearly melting point, BkCl3 converts into an <b>orthorhombic</b> phase.|$|E
5|$|As {{reflected}} in the table above, samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl2-type <b>orthorhombic</b> structure (density 5.90 g/cm3), and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm3).|$|E
5|$|Berkelium forms a {{trigonal}} (η5–C5H5)3Bk complex {{with three}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with the molten beryllocene Be(C5H5)2 at about 70 °C. It has an amber color and <b>orthorhombic</b> symmetry, with the lattice constants of a = 1411 pm, b = 1755 pm and c = 963 pm and the calculated density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 °C, and sublimates without melting at about 350 °C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound within a period of weeks. One C5H5 ring in (η5–C5H5)3Bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield 2. The optical absorption spectra of this compound {{are very similar to}} those of (η5–C5H5)3Bk.|$|E
5|$|Like solid {{chlorine}} and iodine, solid bromine crystallises in the <b>orthorhombic</b> crystal system, in a layered lattice of Br2 molecules. The Br–Br {{distance is}} 227pm (close to the gaseous Br–Br distance of 228pm) and the Br···Br distance between molecules is 331pm within a layer and 399pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of bromine, 195pm). This structure means that bromine {{is a very}} poor conductor of electricity, with a conductivity of around 5×10−13Ω−1cm−1 just below the melting point, although this {{is better than the}} essentially undetectable conductivity of chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Most americium(III) halides form {{hexagonal}} crystals with slight {{variation of}} the color and exact structure between the halogens. So, chloride (AmCl3) is reddish and has a structure isotypic to uranium(III) chloride (space group P63/m) and the melting point of 715°C. The fluoride is isotypic to LaF3 (space group P63/mmc) and the iodide to BiI3 (space group R). The bromide is an exception with the <b>orthorhombic</b> PuBr3-type structure and space group Cmcm. Crystals of americium hexahydrate (AmCl3·6H2O) can be prepared by dissolving americium dioxide in hydrochloric acid and evaporating the liquid. Those crystals are hygroscopic and have yellow-reddish color and a monoclinic crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|At ambient conditions, {{berkelium}} assumes {{its most}} stable α form {{which has a}} hexagonal symmetry, space group P63/mmc, lattice parameters of 341pm and 1107pm. The crystal has a double-hexagonal close packing structure with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic (having a similar structure) with α-lanthanum and α-forms of actinides beyond curium. This crystal structure changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 7GPa, α-berkelium transforms to the beta modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry and space group Fmm. This transition occurs without change in volume, but the enthalpy increases by 3.66 kJ/mol. Upon further compression to 25GPa, berkelium transforms to an <b>orthorhombic</b> γ-berkelium structure {{similar to that of}} α-uranium. This transition is accompanied by a 12% volume decrease and delocalization of the electrons at the 5f electron shell. No further phase transitions are observed up to 57 GPa.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium(III) and berkelium(IV) {{hydroxides}} {{are both}} stable in 1 M sodium hydroxide solutions. Berkelium(III) phosphate (BkPO4) has been prepared as a solid, which shows strong fluorescence under argon laser (514.5nm line) excitation. Berkelium hydrides {{are produced by}} reacting metal with hydrogen gas at temperatures about 250 °C. They are non-stoichiometric with the nominal formula BkH2+x (0 < x < 1). Whereas the trihydride has a hexagonal symmetry, the dihydride crystallizes in an fcc structure with the lattice constant a = 523 pm. Several other salts of berkelium are known, including Bk2O2S, (BkNO3)3·4H2O, BkCl3·6H2O, Bk2(SO4)3·12H2O and Bk2(C2O4)3·4H2O. Thermal decomposition at about 600 °C in an argon atmosphere (to avoid oxidation to Bk2O) of Bk2(SO4)3·12H2O yields the body-centered <b>orthorhombic</b> crystals of berkelium(IV) oxysulfate (Bk2O2SO4). This compound is thermally stable to at least 1000 °C in an inert atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium oxides {{are known}} for the metal {{oxidation}} states +2, +4 and +5. The most stable is white pentoxide Pa2O5, which can be produced by igniting protactinium(V) hydroxide in air at a temperature of 500°C. Its crystal structure is cubic, and the chemical composition is often non-stoichiometric, described as PaO2.25. Another phase of this oxide with <b>orthorhombic</b> symmetry has also been reported. The black dioxide PaO2 is obtained from the pentoxide by reducing it at 1550°C with hydrogen. It is not readily soluble in either dilute or concentrated nitric, hydrochloric or sulfuric acids, but easily dissolves in hydrofluoric acid. The dioxide can be converted back to pentoxide by heating in oxygen-containing atmosphere to 1100°C. The monoxide PaO has only been observed as a thin coating on protactinium metal, but not in an isolated bulk form.|$|E
5|$|Visible {{amounts of}} berkelium(III) {{chloride}} (BkCl3) were first isolated and characterized in 1962, and weighed only 3 billionths of a gram. It {{can be prepared}} by introducing hydrogen chloride vapors into an evacuated quartz tube containing berkelium oxide at a temperature of about 500 °C. This green solid has a melting point of 603 °C and crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system isotypic with uranium(III) chloride (Pearson symbol hP8, space group P63/m, No. 176). Upon heating to just below its melting point, BkCl3 converts into an <b>orthorhombic</b> phase. The hexahydrate BkCl3·6H2O (berkelium trichloride hexahydrate) has a monoclinic structure with the lattice constants a = 966 pm, b = 654 pm and c = 797 pm. Another berkelium(III) chloride, Cs2NaBkCl6 can be crystallized from a chilled aqueous solution containing berkelium(III) hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and caesium chloride. It has a face-centered cubic structure where Bk(III) ions are surrounded by chloride ions in an octahedral configuration.|$|E
5|$|A synthetic, {{radioactive}} element, curium is a hard, dense metal with a silvery-white {{appearance and}} {{physical and chemical}} properties resembling those of gadolinium. Its melting point of 1340°C is significantly higher than that of the previous transuranic elements neptunium (637°C), plutonium (639°C) and americium (1173°C). In comparison, gadolinium melts at 1312°C. The boiling point of curium is 3110°C. With a density of 13.52 g/cm3, curium is significantly lighter than neptunium (20.45 g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8 g/cm3), but is heavier than most other metals. Between two crystalline forms of curium, the α-Cm is more stable at ambient conditions. It has a hexagonal symmetry, space group P63/mmc, lattice parameters a = 365 pm and c = 1182 pm, and four formula units per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum. At pressures above 23 GPa, at room temperature, α-Cm transforms into β-Cm, which has a face-centered cubic symmetry, space group Fmm and the lattice constant a = 493 pm. Upon further compression to 43 GPa, curium transforms to an <b>orthorhombic</b> γ-Cm structure similar to that of α-uranium, with no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa. These three curium phases are also referred to as Cm I, II and III.|$|E
5|$|At ambient conditions, {{americium}} {{is present}} in its most stable α form which has a hexagonal crystal symmetry, and a space group P63/mmc with lattice parameters a= 346.8pm and c= 1124pm, and four atoms per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium. The crystal structure of americium changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry, space group Fmm and lattice constant a= 489pm. This fcc structure {{is equivalent to the}} closest packing with the sequence ABC. Upon further compression to 23 GPa, americium transforms to an <b>orthorhombic</b> γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa. There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770°C it changes into an fcc phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075°C it converts to a body-centered cubic structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of solid astatine is unknown. As an analogue of iodine {{it may have}} an <b>orthorhombic</b> crystalline structure composed of diatomic astatine molecules, and be a semiconductor (with a band gap of 0.7 eV). Alternatively, if condensed astatine forms a metallic phase, as has been predicted, it may have a monatomic face-centered cubic structure. Evidence for (or against) the existence of diatomic astatine (At2) is sparse and inconclusive. Some sources state {{that it does not}} exist, or at least has never been observed, while other sources assert or imply its existence. Despite this controversy, many properties of diatomic astatine have been predicted; for example, its bond length would be 300 ±10 pm, dissociation energy 83.7 ±12.5 kJ·mol−1,, Cl2, Br2, I2, and At2| url=http://theochem.chem.rug.nl/publications/PDF/ft279.pdf| journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics |volume=104 |issue=22|pages=9040–9046| doi=10.1063/1.471636|bibcode= 1996JChPh.104.9040V}} and heat of vaporization (∆Hvap) 54.39 kJ·mol−1. The latter figure means that astatine may (at least) be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with a heat of vaporization greater than ~42 kJ·mol−1 are metallic when liquid; diatomic iodine, with a value of 41.71 kJ·mol−1, falls just short of the threshold figure.|$|E
25|$|In total {{there are}} seven crystal systems: triclinic, monoclinic, <b>orthorhombic,</b> tetragonal, trigonal, hexagonal, and cubic.|$|E
25|$|BaBr2 {{crystallizes}} in a {{lead chloride}} motif, giving white <b>orthorhombic</b> crystals which are deliquescent.|$|E
25|$|Pyridine {{crystallizes}} in an <b>orthorhombic</b> {{crystal system}} with space group Pna21 and lattice parameters a=1752pm, b=897pm, c=1135pm, and 16 formula units per unit cell (measured at 153K). For comparison, crystalline benzene is also <b>orthorhombic,</b> with space group Pbca, a=729.2pm, b=947.1pm, c=674.2pm (at 78K), {{but the number}} of molecules per cell is only 4. This difference is partly related to the lower symmetry of the individual pyridine molecule (C2v vs. D6h for benzene). A trihydrate (pyridine·3H2O) is known; it also crystallizes in an <b>orthorhombic</b> system in the space group Pbca, lattice parameters a=1244pm, b=1783pm, c=679pm and eight formula units per unit cell (measured at 223K).|$|E

Atomic coordinates, site occupancies and isotropic displacement factors are listed in table IX.|$|E
25|$|The {{action of}} {{piezoelectricity}} in Topaz can probably {{be attributed to}} ordering of the (F,OH) in its lattice, which is otherwise centrosymmetric: <b>orthorhombic</b> bipyramidal (mmm). Topaz has anomalous optical properties which are attributed to such ordering.|$|E
25|$|The crystal {{structure}} of tungsten trioxide is temperature dependent. It is tetragonal at temperatures above 740°C, <b>orthorhombic</b> from 330 to 740°C, monoclinic from 17 to 330°C, and triclinic from -50 to 17°C. The most common structure of WO3 is monoclinic with space group P21/n.|$|E
25|$|The pure {{anhydrous}} <b>orthorhombic</b> form (δ) rapidly {{changes to}} one of the other forms on exposure to the atmosphere, and a possible explanation is that the OH− ions originating from the absorbed water facilitate the rearrangement. Rapid cooling of molten ZnCl2 gives a glass.|$|E
25|$|Black {{phosphorus}} has an <b>orthorhombic</b> {{structure and}} is the least reactive allotrope, {{a result of its}} lattice of interlinked six-membered rings where each atom is bonded to three other atoms. Black and red phosphorus can also take a cubic crystal lattice structure. A recent synthesis of black phosphorus using metal salts as catalysts has been reported.|$|E
25|$|Compositions with x > 0.7 do {{not exist}} at {{ordinary}} pressures (see dicalcium aluminate). The crystal is <b>orthorhombic,</b> and is normally lath-like. Its density varies from 4026kg⋅m−3 (x = 0) to 3614kg⋅m−3 (x = 0.7). All compositions melt incongruently in the range 1400−1450°C. They are ferromagnetic, progressively more so as iron content increases. These phases are easily prepared from the oxides.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} symmetric, the cubic (or isometric) system, has the symmetry of a cube, that is, it exhibits four threefold rotational axes oriented at 109.5° (the tetrahedral angle) {{with respect to}} each other. These threefold axes lie along the body diagonals of the cube. The other six lattice systems, are hexagonal, tetragonal, rhombohedral (often confused with the trigonal crystal system), <b>orthorhombic,</b> monoclinic and triclinic.|$|E
25|$|PbCl2 occurs {{naturally}} {{in the form}} of the mineral cotunnite. It is colorless, white, yellow, or green with a density of 5.3–5.8 g/cm3. The hardness on the Mohs scale is 1.5–2. The crystal structure is <b>orthorhombic</b> dipyramidal and the point group is 2/m 2/m 2/m. Each Pb has a coordination number of 9. Cotunnite occurs near volcanoes: Vesuvius, Italy; Tarapacá, Chile; and Tolbachik, Russia.|$|E
25|$|Some {{directions}} and planes {{are defined by}} symmetry of the crystal system. In monoclinic, rhombohedral, tetragonal, and trigonal/hexagonal systems there is one unique axis (sometimes called the principal axis) which has higher rotational symmetry {{than the other two}} axes. The basal plane is the plane perpendicular to the principal axis in these crystal systems. For triclinic, <b>orthorhombic,</b> and cubic crystal systems the axis designation is arbitrary and there is no principal axis.|$|E

The 9 chloride ions are not equidistant from the central lead atom, 7 lie at 280–309pm and 2 at 370pm. PbCl2 forms white <b>orthorhombic</b> needles. While Lead(II) chloride is abundant in many natural water reserves, it is unsafe for human consumption and must be filtered out.|$|E
25|$|NaBH4 is a salt, {{consisting}} of the tetrahedral BH4− anion. The solid is known to exist as three polymorphs: α, β and γ. The stable phase at room temperature and pressure is α-NaBH4, which is cubic and adopts an NaCl-type structure, in the Fm3m space group. At a pressure of 6.3 GPa, the structure changes to the tetragonal β-NaBH4 (space group P421c) and at 8.9 GPa, the <b>orthorhombic</b> γ-NaBH4 (space group Pnma) becomes the most stable.|$|E

25|$|Chemistry {{and crystal}} {{structure}} together define a mineral. With a restriction to 32 point groups, minerals of different chemistry may have identical crystal structure. For example, halite (NaCl), galena (PbS), and periclase (MgO) all {{belong to the}} hexaoctahedral point group (isometric family), as they have a similar stoichiometry between their different constituent elements. In contrast, polymorphs are groupings of minerals that share a chemical formula but have a different structure. For example, pyrite and marcasite, both iron sulfides, have the formula FeS2; however, the former is isometric while the latter is <b>orthorhombic.</b> This polymorphism extends to other sulfides with the generic AX2 formula; these two groups are collectively known as the pyrite and marcasite groups.|$|E
25|$|Compounds {{that were}} {{historically}} given the formulae REAlB14 and REB25 have the MgAlB14 structure with an <b>orthorhombic</b> symmetry and space group Imma (No. 74). In this structure, rare-earth atoms enter the Mg site. Aluminium sites are empty for REB25. Both metal sites of REAlB14 structure have partial occupancies of about 60–70%, {{which shows that}} the compounds are actually non-stoichiometric. The REB25 formula merely reflects the average atomic ratio / = 25. Yttrium borides form both YAlB14 and YB25 structures. Experiments have confirmed that the borides based on rare-earth elements from Tb to Lu can have the REAlB14 structure. A subset of these borides, which contains rare-earth elements from Gd to Er, can also crystallize in the REB25 structure.|$|E
