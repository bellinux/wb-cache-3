40|$|Structural {{materials}} {{often have}} variations in their microstructures and, in some cases, the material properties {{that derive from}} microstructure. Thus, it would be reasonable to utilize a statistical approach that considers {{the effect of these}} variations. In materials that accumulate some damage before failure, material properties may depend on slight variations in microstructure as these can have significant effect on stress singularities. Therefore, {{it would be useful to}} adopt a tool able to account for the microstructural effects on the global response. To this aim, a statistical approach for brittle fracture is used in conjunction with a microstructural-based finite element model, <b>OOF.</b> <b>This</b> computational tool, that operates directly on microstructural images, is employed to investigate the effect of microstructural features on the mechanical behavior of several typologies of complex materials. Computer simulations are performed to analyze the reliability and damage accumulation of laminated microstructures, random polycrystals and particulate composites. Moreover, FGMs (Functionally graded materials) are considered in order to investigate the effect of microstructure variations through thickness on the fracture behavior...|$|E
40|$|Operation in the {{continuous}} conduction mode in power-factor-correction(PFC) converters,the {{behavior of the}} current control loop determines how accurately the input current tracks the desired waveshape. Since the behavior <b>oof</b> <b>this</b> loop {{is influenced by the}} impedance of the electromagnetic interference filter and the unknown time-dependent line impedance, guaranteeing stability of the converter under all circumstances is not obvious. To increase the robustness of the current-control loop against variations of the impedance at the input of the converter, the insertion of a low-pass filter in the measurement circuit of the input voltage is suggeted here. However this manner may lead to more serious input current distortion when the input voltage is at the zero-crossing in converters, and this problem may be worsen in the applications with a high line frequency(e. g., 400 Mz power systems on commercial aircraft), This paper analyzes the cause of zero-crossing distortion and indicates that input current leads the input voltage is the key reason for a non-unity fundamental displacement factor and zero-crossing distortion in boost PFC converter. A digital control method is proposed, according to the value of input current at the zero-crossing of input voltage, and the initial phase angle of reference input valtage is adjusted to improve the zero-crossing distorted phenomenon of the PFC converter. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method is good for AC power supply,especially under higher frequency of 400 Hz...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} an automatic method for accurate road centreline extraction from classified images. Unlike earlier methods that have mainly {{relied on the}} thinning algorithm, the proposed automatic method selects end points from a classified image and then connects them using the geodesic method to formulate the road network. As the proposed method generates the road centreline by tracing along the ridge line of the optimally oriented flux (<b>OOF)</b> measure, <b>this</b> method is able to eliminate undesired spurs while retaining the correct road network topology. Three test images are used to quantitatively evaluate the proposed method. Experiments show that the proposed method yields a substantial improvement over the thinning algorithm.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of aerial predators and migrant Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) was studied at Mary's Point {{in the upper}} Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada, during August of 2009 and 2010. Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) were locally reintroduced and increased from one active nest site in 1989 to 27 in 2010, which coincided with a decline of sandpipers roosting at Mary's Point from an annual mean of 161, 000 in 1976 â€" 1982 to 15, 000 or less during this study. Mean roosting time of flocks was 33 min (range = 10 to 40 min; N = 6). Sandpipers returned to the beach 1 h: 36 min after high-tide (range = 1 h: 10 to 2 h: 13 min; N = 5), but were soon flushed again by falcons. On ten of 19 days, during part of the high-tide period, flocks of sandpipers remained in flight over the ocean. Termed Over-Ocean Flocking (<b>OOF),</b> <b>this</b> behavior was seen on days when spring tides inundated all beach habitat, and also at lower tides, which supports the hypothesis that OOF is an antipredator strategy intended to avoid surprise attacks by falcons near the shore. Raptors sighted during 128 hours afield included 226 Peregrines, 20 Merlins (Falco columbarius) and two Sharp-shinned Hawks (Accipiter striatus). At 1. 0 â€" 3. 2 Peregrine sightings/h- 1 (mean 1. 8) the level of disturbance is high and supports {{the hypothesis that the}} decline in roosting sandpipers at Mary's Point is linked to predation danger...|$|E
