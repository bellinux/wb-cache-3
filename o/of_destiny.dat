5|$|A sense <b>of</b> <b>destiny</b> {{is present}} in the novel through {{patterns}} of repetition, including reversals <b>of</b> <b>destiny</b> in a number of characters. Characters who are paired together tend to suffer the same destiny: Ti Noel and Monsieur Lenormand de Mezy both witness the marvels of the age and slowly decline; both Pauline and Solimán indulge in their wealthy positions and then sink into madness. There is a clear pattern of succession from fortune to misfortune.|$|E
