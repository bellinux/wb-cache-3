25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dresser</b> I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
500|$|While {{recovering}} in the hospital, Morenz {{received many}} get-well cards and visits from his teammates and players from other NHL teams. So {{many of them}} brought drinks that a teammate remarked that [...] "the whisky was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dresser</b> and the beer was under the bed." [...] Though there were many visitors, Morenz often found himself alone in the hospital room, unable to move off his bed. To pass the time, he read newspapers to stay up to date with the Canadiens as they finished the season. Since his injury, the team had dropped in the standings, causing Morenz to worry. He began to think he would never play hockey again and became depressed.|$|E
2500|$|In the Goblet of Fire, {{the truth}} about Hagrid’s parents is revealed: his father, who is never named in the stories, married a giantess, Fridwulfa. Fridwulfa left Rubeus to his father’s care after his birth; {{according}} to Hagrid, she was not very maternal. Later {{she gave birth to}} Grawp. She died long before Hagrid returned to the giants in the Order of the Phoenix. Hagrid describes his father as [...] "a tiny little man" [...] whom he could pick up with one hand and place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dresser</b> at the age of six. Hagrid clearly felt great affection for him; in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, he says that his father’s death when Hagrid was in third year at Hogwarts was one of his saddest memories.|$|E
60|$|Lawyer Quince {{dropped the}} hoe with a clatter and stood {{regarding}} her open-mouthed. He was a careful {{man with his}} property, and the stout door boasted a good lock.

50|$|After {{finishing}} the Brooklyn lecture session, Vivekananda moved to New York. But, {{few of his}} disciples started going to the place at New York where Vivekananda stayed at that time. So, Vivekananda had to start classes there too. It was a small room of a lodging house where he was staying {{at that time and}} the number of students and disciples increased so rapidly that it soon went beyond of the small room's capacity of the chairs. But, his students still used to sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, <b>dresser</b> etc. to hear his words.|$|R
2500|$|... "On Tuesday evening, at 5pm, Messrs Grove, of Bond Street, {{sent word}} {{that they had}} a very fine {{sturgeon}} on their slab. Of course, I went down at once to see it... The fish measured 9 feet in length [...] I wanted to make a cast of the fellow... and they offered me the fish for the night: he must be back in the shop the next morning by 10 am... I was determined to get him into the kitchen somehow; so, tying a rope to his tail, I let him slide down the stone stairs by his own weight. He started all right, but 'getting way' on him, I could hold the rope no more, and away he went sliding headlong down the stairs, like an avalanche down Mont Blanc... he smashed the door open... and slid right into the kitchen... till at last he brought himself to an anchor under the kitchen table. This sudden and unexpected appearance of the armour-clad sea monster, bursting open the door... instantly created a sensation. The cook screamed, the house-maid fainted, the cat jumped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dresser,</b> the dog retreated behind the copper and barked, the monkeys went mad with fright, and the sedate parrot has never spoken a word since." ...|$|E

60|$|Undismayed by this, Susan {{opened the}} door and looked in. The floor was {{littered}} with fragments of broken dishes, for it seemed that the fatal tragedy had taken place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long <b>dresser</b> where Susan's array of cooking bowls had been marshalled in shining state. Around the kitchen tore a frantic cat, with his head wedged tightly in an old salmon can. Blindly he careered about with shrieks and profanity commingled, now banging the can madly against anything he encountered, now trying vainly to wrench it off with his paws.|$|R
50|$|The {{bathroom}} {{was long and}} narrow, but the kitchen was big, and always smelled of baking and jam making. The two parrots, Polly the Amazon green, and Sunshine the African grey, sat in their cages <b>on</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>dresser.</b> Both had a wonderful vocabulary and {{seemed to have the}} knack of saying the right thing at the right time. In the cupboard next to the gas cooker was a peep hole where I could look into the stone age part of the museum.|$|R

50|$|The {{musician}} {{asked to}} be taken to Cesare, who was dying. Before he died, Cesare realized that he had not been forgotten by his old friend; he asked the musician to take Jackie and look after him. With his second performance canceled, the musician took the young boy to his home. As the boy was being put to bed in the musician's bedroom, he saw a picture of a woman <b>on</b> <b>the</b> man's <b>dresser</b> and exclaimed it was a photo of his mother. Jackie reached into his bag where he carried his violin and brought out the photo of his mother; it was an identical copy.|$|R
60|$|He made a bow, {{and paying}} no further {{attention}} to the torrent of her reproaches or the threats of the helpless commandant, he calmly searched {{the room with the}} lantern, and finally pulled out from under the bed a metal despatch box. Then he lighted a candle in a brass candlestick that stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> simple walnut <b>dresser,</b> and bowed again to the outraged couple in the four-poster.|$|R
60|$|They {{went downstairs}} again. By {{that time it}} was thundering and raining heavily. The rooms were dark and gloomy. The big side door, which would not shut unless locked from the outside, swayed and banged as the gusts of wind swept round the house. But they had a good time in the front kitchen, playing cricket with an {{umbrella}} and the agent's order crumpled into a ball. Presently the artistic house-hunter lifted Euphemia <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> tall <b>dresser,</b> and they sat there swinging their feet patiently until the storm should leave off and release them.|$|R

6000|$|Dandy {{always had}} {{something}} to eat at mealtimes, but he too liked a snack between meals {{once or twice a}} day. The dog-biscuits were kept in an open box <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>dresser</b> shelf, so that he could get one [...] "whenever he felt so disposed," [...] but he didn't like the trouble this arrangement gave him, so he would sit down and start barking, and as he had a bark which was both deep and loud, after it had been repeated a dozen times at intervals of five seconds, any person who happened to be in or near the kitchen was glad to give him his biscuit for the sake of peace and quietness. If no one gave it him, he would then take it out himself and eat it.|$|R

Located just west of the previous structure, it rises to a height of 52 ft and includes a separate pathway for the Virginia Capital Trail project.|$|R
6000|$|Tammas Haggart was {{the most}} sarcastic member of the club, being celebrated for his sarcasm far and wide. It was a {{remarkable}} thing about him, often spoken of, that {{if you went to}} Tammas with a stranger and asked him to say a sarcastic thing that the man might take away as a specimen, he could not do it. [...] "Na, na," [...] Tammas would say, after a few trials, referring to sarcasm, [...] "she's no a critter to force. Ye maun lat her tak her ain time. Sometimes she's dry like the pump, an' syne, again, oot she comes in a gush." [...] The most sarcastic thing the stone-breaker ever said was frequently marvelled over in Thrums, both before and behind his face, but unfortunately no one could ever remember what it was. The subject, however, was Cha Tamson's potato pit. There is little doubt that it was a fit of sarcasm that induced Tammas to marry a gypsy lassie. Mr. Byars would not join them, so Tammas had himself married by Jimmy Pawse, the gay little gypsy king, and after that the minister re-married them. The marriage over the tongs is a thing to scandalise any well-brought-up person, for before he joined the couple's hands, Jimmy jumped about in a startling way, uttering wild gibberish, and after the ceremony was over there was rough work, with incantations and blowing on pipes. Tammas always held that this marriage turned out better than he had expected, though he had his trials like other married men. Among them was Chirsty's way of climbing <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>dresser</b> to get at the higher part of the plate-rack. One evening I called in to have a smoke with the stone-breaker, and while we were talking Chirsty climbed <b>the</b> <b>dresser.</b> <b>The</b> next moment she was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor <b>on</b> her back, wailing, but Tammas smoked on imperturbably. [...] "Do you not see what has happened, man?" [...] I cried. [...] "Ou," [...] said Tammas, [...] "she's aye fa'in aff the dresser." ...|$|R
