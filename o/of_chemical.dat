40|$|Risk {{management}} <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> requires {{information about}} their adverse effects such as toxicity and persistence, for example. Testing <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> allows for improving the information base for regulatory decision-making on chemicals' production and use. Testing a large number <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> with limited time and resources forces a prioritization <b>of</b> <b>chemicals.</b> This paper proposes a decision model that provides a ranking <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> according to "urgency to test". The model adopts a value-of-information approach describing the expected welfare gains from regulatory actions that respond to test information. We determine the value-of-information of tests revealing chemicals' levels of toxicity and persistence. We compare our findings to the prioritization <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> in the new European Chemicals Regulation "REACH", where several tens <b>of</b> thousands <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> are to be tested in order to fill existing information gaps and to implement more effective risk management. We find that the main lines of chemicals' prioritization under REACH receive backing from our decision model. However, prioritization for testing can be further improved by accounting for testing costs and the sensitivity of regulatory action {{with respect to the}} test information...|$|R

5|$|The {{destruction}} of Syria's chemical weapons began in September 2013 {{on the basis}} of several international agreements with Syria that stipulated an initial destruction deadline of 30 June 2014. United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118 of 27 September 2013 required Syria to assume responsibility for and follow a timeline for the {{destruction of}} its chemical weapons and its chemical weapon production facilities. The resolution bound Syria to the implementation plan presented in a decision of the Organisation for the Prohibition <b>of</b> <b>Chemical</b> Weapons (OPCW). On 23 June 2014, the last declared chemical weapons were shipped out of Syria for destruction. The destruction of the most dangerous chemical weapons was performed at sea aboard the Cape Ray, a vessel of the United States Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force, crewed with U.S. civilian merchant mariners. The actual destruction operations, performed by a team of U.S. Army civilians and contractors, destroyed 600 metric tons <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> agents in 42 days. However, despite these efforts, the use <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons in Syria have continued to be reported, with the latest being the chemical attack on Khan Shaykhun in April 2017, which has been alleged to have been perpetrated by the Syrian government.|$|E
5|$|The {{efficacy}} <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> pesticides {{tends to}} diminish over time. This is because any organism that manages {{to survive the}} initial application will pass on its genes to its offspring and a resistant strain will be developed. In this way, {{some of the most}} serious pests have developed resistance and are no longer killed by pesticides that used to kill their ancestors. This necessitates higher concentrations <b>of</b> <b>chemical,</b> more frequent applications and a movement to more expensive formulations.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> defences {{in plants}} {{is linked to}} the emergence <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> substances that are not involved in the essential photosynthetic and metabolic activities. These substances, secondary metabolites, are organic compounds that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development or reproduction of organisms, and often produced as by-products during the synthesis of primary metabolic products. Although these secondary metabolites have been thought {{to play a major role}} in defenses against herbivores, a meta-analysis of recent relevant studies has suggested that they have either a more minimal (when compared to other non-secondary metabolites, such as primary chemistry and physiology) or more complex involvement in defense.|$|E

Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E

These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. Organic methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> milling. Typically, {{chemical milling}} is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the serial number is {{brought back to the}} surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E
