5|$|From 1978, Ecclestone was {{president}} of the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA), a body formed by the teams to represent their interests. This left his team open to accusations of having advance warning of rule changes. Ecclestone denies that the team benefited from this and Murray has noted that, contrary to this view, at the end of 1982 the team had to abandon their new BT51 car, built on the basis that ground effect would be permitted in 1983. Brabham had to design and build a replacement, the BT52, in only three months. At the end of the 1983 season, Renault and Ferrari, both beaten to the Drivers' Championship by Piquet, protested that the Research <b>Octane</b> <b>Number</b> (RON) of the team's fuel was above the legal limit of 102. The FIA declared that a figure of up to 102.9 was permitted under the rules, and that Brabham had not exceeded this limit.|$|E

25|$|Normal butane can be {{used for}} {{gasoline}} blending, as a fuel gas, fragrance extraction solvent, either alone or in a mixture with propane, and as a feedstock for the manufacture of ethylene and butadiene, a key ingredient of synthetic rubber.

25|$|From the {{combustion}} chamber shape and features, the fuel octane requirements of Wankel engines {{are lower than}} in reciprocating piston engines. The maximum road <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> requirements were 82 for a peripheral-intake port wankel engine, and less than 70 for a side-inlet port engine.

25|$|The {{product of}} the unit, the alkylate, is {{composed}} of a mixture of high-octane, branched-chain paraffinic hydrocarbons (mostly isoheptane and isooctane). Alkylate is a premium gasoline blending stock because it has exceptional antiknock properties and is clean burning. The <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> of the alkylate depends mainly upon the kind of alkenes used and upon operating conditions. For example, isooctane results from combining butylene with isobutane and has an octane rating of 100 by definition. There are other products in the alkylate effluent, however, so the octane rating will vary accordingly.|$|E
30|$|Besides, FCC {{gasoline}} {{generally has}} high content of olefins which has high <b>octane</b> <b>numbers.</b> However, extravagant olefins make the gasoline stability worse {{and increase the}} emission of CO and NO when combusted in engines. The olefin content in end gasoline products is also strictly restricted. Therefore, controlling the olefin content simultaneously to improve the <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> of FCC gasoline {{is the key to}} improving current and future end gasoline product’s qualities. Among numerous methods, the use of catalysts or additives to improve the FCC gasoline octane is the most cost-effective, direct and effective way to upgrade petrol problem.|$|R

40|$|Detailed kinetic {{models of}} {{pyrolysis}} and combustion of hydrocarbon fuels are now reliable tools which can aid {{the design of}} internal combustion engines required to meet the increasingly stringent pollutant formation and engine efficiency standards.

Detailed chemistry not only helps to explain the different reactivities of alkanes and alkenes but also the combustion behavior of hydrocarbon mixtures. A two-zone model of a spark ignition engine, coupled with the detailed chemistry of combustion processes, was developed and utilized for the predictions of <b>octane</b> <b>numbers.</b> This model explains the effect of various components on the knocking behavior of the fuel under different operating conditions and is thus a useful tool both in formulating new fuels and designing new engines...|$|R
25|$|Since {{crude oil}} {{generally}} contains only 10 to 40 percent of hydrocarbon constituents in the gasoline range, refineries typically use a {{fluid catalytic cracking}} unit (FCCU) process to convert high molecular weight hydrocarbons into smaller and more volatile compounds, which are then converted into liquid gasoline-size hydrocarbons. Alkylation processes transform low molecular-weight alkenes and iso-paraffin molecules into larger iso-paraffins with a high <b>octane</b> <b>number.</b> While FCCUs are a very common unit in modern oil refineries, it is not common for a refinery have an alkylation unit. Indeed, as of 2010 there are some {{countries in the world}} without any installed alkylation units.|$|E
25|$|Benzene is {{a natural}} {{constituent}} of crude oil {{and is one of}} the elementary petrochemicals. Due to the cyclic continuous pi bond between the carbon atoms, benzene is classed as an aromatic hydrocarbon, the second -annulene (-annulene). It is sometimes abbreviated Ph–H. Benzene is a colorless and highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell, and is responsible for the aroma around petrol stations. It is used primarily as a precursor to the manufacture of chemicals with more complex structure, such as ethylbenzene and cumene, of which billions of kilograms are produced. As benzene has a high <b>octane</b> <b>number,</b> it is an important component of gasoline.|$|E

30|$|The {{effects of}} acidity and pore {{properties}} of rare earth modified USY on heavy oil conversion were investigated. USY with varied rare earth contents were prepared with impregnation method. FCC catalysts were also prepared with modified USY and tested by micro activity tests (MAT) and advanced catalytic evaluation (ACE). The {{results showed that}} USY 3 had a good performance in cracking polycyclic hydrocarbons in heavy oil and diesel to aromatics and iso-olefins that exist in gasoline; the surface area and pore volume of USY 3 increased by 54  m 2 /g and 0.032  ml/g, respectively, after porosity cleaning; the new optimized FCC catalysts improved the cracking of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to form gasoline with high <b>octane</b> <b>numbers.</b> When tested on a pilot riser unit at 500  °C and 1.89  s with a catalyst-to-oil ratio of 5.6, the new catalyst Cat- 3 had a 0.24  % higher propylene yield and a 1.52  % higher liquid yield compared with the reference catalyst Cat- 1.

30|$|Gasoline in {{refineries}} comes {{mainly from}} the units such as steaming of crude oil, catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, hydrocracking and alkylation. The fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process {{is one of the}} most important means in deep process of crude oil due to its applicability, flexibility and good economical feasibility. In China, more than 75  % of motor gasoline is provided by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units. However, the <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> of FCC gasoline is too low to meet the requirements of motor fuels. On the other hand, the increasing severe crude oil supplies worldwide and more attention on environmental regulations are promoting the tendency of converting heavy oil into high qualified gasoline with high <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> by FCC process [1, 2]. Besides, with the rapid development of China’s automobile industry, car ownership especially imported high-end cars and domestic joint ventures has been increasing substantially. To work with high compression as well as to meet the requirements of increasingly stringent environmental regulations on automobile engines, gasoline upgrading and the demand of high-octane gasoline are increasing prominently and had been rapidly increasing in recent decades.|$|R

2500|$|The {{octane rating}} of {{n-butanol}} {{is similar to}} that of gasoline but lower than that of ethanol and methanol. n-Butanol has a RON (Research <b>Octane</b> <b>number)</b> of 96 and a MON (Motor <b>octane</b> <b>number)</b> of 78 (with a resulting [...] "(R+M)/2 pump octane number" [...] of 87, as used in North America) while t-butanol has octane ratings of 105 RON and 89 MON. t-Butanol is used as an additive in gasoline but cannot be used as a fuel in its pure form because its relatively high melting point of 25.5°C (79°F) causes it to gel and solidify near room temperature. On the other hand, isobutanol has a lower melting point than n-butanol and favorable RON of 113 and MON of 94, and is thus much better suited to high fraction gasoline blends, blends with n-butanol, or as a standalone fuel.|$|E
2500|$|As a fuel, {{methanol}} and ethanol {{both have}} {{advantages and disadvantages}} over fuels such as petrol (gasoline) and diesel fuel. In spark ignition engines, both alcohols can run {{at a much higher}} exhaust gas recirculation rates and with higher compression ratios. [...] Both alcohols have a high octane rating, with ethanol at 109 RON (Research <b>Octane</b> <b>Number),</b> 90 MON (Motor <b>Octane</b> <b>Number),</b> (which equates to 99.5 AKI) and methanol at 109 RON, 89 MON (which equates to 99 AKI). Note that AKI refers to 'Anti-Knock Index' which averages the RON and MON ratings (RON+MON)/2, and is used on U.S. gas station pumps. [...] Ordinary European petrol is typically 95 RON, 85 MON, equal to 90 AKI. [...] As a compression ignition engine fuel, both alcohols create very little particulates, but their low cetane number means that an ignition improver like glycol must be mixed into the fuel with approx. 5%.|$|E
40|$|Tetraethyllead (TEL) and tetramethyllead (TML) were {{produced}} world-wide as anti-knocking additives for gasoline to increase <b>octane</b> <b>numbers.</b> The use of leaded gasoline over almost one century caused an ubiquiteous pollution {{of the environment}} with lead ions or alkyllead compounds (Rhue et al. 1992).

40|$|The {{development}} of new catalysts for normal alkanes isomerization reveals a big importance. Three series of catalysts were prepared by using sol-gel method, using different metal concentration and in two different pH (acid and basic). The first series contains molybdenum, the second contains tungsten and the third contains the two metals (molybdenum and tungsten). The catalysts were characterized by several techniques; the obtained {{results show that the}} catalysts prepared in basic pH have a surfaces areas and porous volumes higher than those prepared in acid pH. In order to evaluate the catalytic performances of prepared catalysts, we carried out the catalytic tests with light naphtha (C 5, C 6) isomerization. The obtained results show that the best conversions are obtained with catalysts prepared into pH basic. The <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> of the obtained products (isomerate) are high compared to naphtha. The addition of the obtained products (isomerate) into the pool gasoline allows on the one hand, to obtain gasolines with high <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> which respect the environmental standards, and on the other hand, the possibility of developing the light fractions (C 5 - C 6) resulting from the crude oil distillation unit and condensed split distillation...|$|R

2500|$|Dragan and his {{colleague}} {{were the first to}} report about isomerization in alkanes. [...] Isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight-chain alkanes are heated {{in the presence of a}} platinum catalyst. In isomerization, the alkanes become branched-chain isomers. In other words, it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens, keeping the same molecular weight. In reformation, the alkanes become cycloalkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons, giving off hydrogen as a by-product. Both of these processes raise the <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> of the substance. Butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization, as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers.|$|E

50|$|Engine {{knocking}} is {{an unwanted}} {{process that can}} occur during high compression ratio in internal combustion engines. Graham Edgar in 1926 added different amounts of n-heptane and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane to gasoline, and discovered that the knocking stopped when 2,2,4-trimethylpentane was added. This was {{the origin of the}} octane rating scale. Test motors using 2,2,4-trimethylpentane gave a certain performance which was standardized as 100 octane. The same test motors, run in the same fashion, using heptane, gave a performance which was standardized as 0 octane.
