5|$|With the {{introduction}} of templates into the C++ programming language, and the advent <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> programming techniques pioneered by the Standard Template Library, {{the need for a}} mechanism for obtaining the type of an expression, commonly referred to as typeof, was recognized.

40|$|We {{prove the}} {{conjecture}} of Sfetsos, Siampos and Thompson that suitable analytic continuations of the Poisson-Lie T-duals of the bi-Yang-Baxter sigma models {{coincide with the}} recently introduced generalized lambda models. We then generalize this result by showing that the analytic continuation <b>of</b> a <b>generic</b> sigma model <b>of</b> "universal WZW-type" introduced by Tseytlin in 1993 is nothing but the Poisson-Lie T-dual <b>of</b> a <b>generic</b> Poisson-Lie symmetric sigma model introduced by Klimcik and Severa in 1995.

Mentzer got verbal permission to publish it with New Infinities, but since the permission was not in writing TSR filed an injunction to prevent the adventure's sale, although the injunction was later lifted. The legal costs further drained NIPI of capital.|$|E
5|$|Rocksteady {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a sequel before development of Arkham Asylum had concluded, developing ideas for both the story and setting so the games' narratives could be effectively connected; a secret room was hidden in the asylum warden's office in Arkham Asylum containing hints of how the sequel would progress, including blueprints for the Arkham City prison; the blueprints are quite similar to its final layout in Arkham City. The original idea was to take the game out of the asylum setting and onto the streets of Gotham City while retaining the level of design detail put into the asylum. To that end they wanted to include locations from the Batman mythos that were notable and meaningful to the character, instead of a series <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> streets; Rocksteady was initially unsure how technical considerations would limit the scope of this idea.|$|E
5|$|With ultra-violent {{films such}} as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Thirst (2009), Park Chan-wook of South Korea {{has been the most}} {{prominent}} director outside of the United States to work regularly in a noir mode in the new millennium. The most commercially successful neo-noir of this period has been Sin City (2005), directed by Robert Rodriguez in extravagantly stylized black and white with the odd bit of color. The film is based on a series of comic books created by Frank Miller (credited as the film's codirector), which are in turn openly indebted to the works of Spillane and other pulp mystery authors. Another comic book adaptation with similar style and elements is The Spirit (2008). This film is adapted from the comic book of the same name originally created by cartoonist Will Eisner. Similarly, graphic novels provide the basis for Road to Perdition (2002), directed by Sam Mendes, and A History of Violence (2005), directed by David Cronenberg; the latter was voted best film {{of the year in the}} annual Village Voice poll. Writer-director Rian Johnson's Brick (2005), featuring present-day high schoolers speaking a version of 1930s hardboiled argot, won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival. The television series Veronica Mars (2004–07) also brought a youth-oriented twist to film noir. Examples of this sort <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> crossover have been dubbed teen noir.|$|E
