5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> are.|$|E
500|$|The 2001 film Legally Blonde {{marked a}} turning point in Witherspoon's career; she starred as Elle Woods, a fashion-merchandising major who decides to become a law student in order to follow her ex-boyfriend to Harvard Law School. Witherspoon said about the role, [...] "When I read Legally Blonde, I was like, 'She's from Beverly Hills, she's rich, she's in a sorority. She has a great boyfriend. Oh yeah, she gets dumped. Who cares? I still hate her.' So we had to make sure she was the kind <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> just can't hate." [...] Legally Blonde was a box-office hit, {{grossing}} US$96 million domestically. Witherspoon's performance earned her praise from critics, as the press began referring to her as [...] "the new Meg Ryan". Roger Ebert commented, [...] "Witherspoon effortlessly animated this material with sunshine and quick wit", and Salon.com noted that [...] "she [...] delineates Elle's character beautifully". Meanwhile, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer concluded, [...] "Witherspoon is a talented comedian who can perk up a scene just by marching in full of pep and drive and she powers this modest little comedy almost single-handedly." [...] For her work, Witherspoon garnered her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Nikki Wilson {{described}} Captain Adelaide Brooke, {{played by}} actress Lindsay Duncan, as [...] "the Doctor's cleverest and most strong-minded companion yet." [...] David Tennant said, [...] "Well, she's {{not really a}} companion like the others have been... She's very wary of the Doctor; she's not the sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> could imagine hooking up with him and riding off into the sunset... she's kind of the alpha male in the room, really. So, the Doctor has to learn to assume a slightly different role when he's around her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} like being armed," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "On some of these trails, there is no telling what sort <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>you</b> will meet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you {{by saying}} what I think <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>you</b> esteem. Stop me whilst you can." ...|$|R

2500|$|Pipes's views gained {{widespread}} {{public attention}} when they triggered a filibuster in the United States Senate against his nomination by President George W. Bush {{to the board}} of the United States Institute of Peace. Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) explained that he was [...] "offended" [...] by Pipes's comments on Islam, and that while [...] "some people call [...] a scholar... this is not the kind <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> want on the USIP." [...] While defending Pipes's nomination, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer distanced Bush from Pipes's views, saying that Bush [...] "disagrees with Pipes about whether Islam is a peaceful religion".|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{at first}} {{appearing}} as an immature prankster, Lionel's second stint saw the character {{develop into a}} more sensitive character with [...] "little-boy-lost" [...] vulnerability. John Leigh described Lionel as likeable, stating; [...] "Lionel is this great trier. That's why people have latched on to him. He doesn't have all the swankiness of the doctors â€“ their money and their looks. A lot of people always see themselves as falling a bit short of the mark and everyone does in some way. People identity with this struggle." [...] Leigh {{found it difficult to}} understand how Lionel attracted women, saying, [...] "Lionel is the sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> want to meet when you're ready to settle down. He's a nice guy. You can trust him. He can cook. He can fix things. None of these things is exciting to a young woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't!" [...] she cried, sharply. [...] "Remember {{our first}} meeting. I {{am not the}} sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> imagine. I never can be. There are reasons--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir, in {{my small}} {{business}} way, I have not conversed {{with so many}} masters, gentlemen masters, for nothing. I have been taught that in this world there is a precedence of opinions as well as <b>of</b> <b>persons.</b> <b>You</b> have kindly given me your views, I am now, with modesty, about to give you mine." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{teaching}} in the Academy is now, under all circumstances, gratuitous; would you wish that system to continue, or should you prefer to see a system of payment?--I am not prepared to answer that question. It would depend upon the sort of system that was adopted and on the kind <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>you</b> received into your schools.|$|R
60|$|The laws {{you have}} already passed for the {{establishment}} of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions <b>of</b> <b>persons.</b> <b>You</b> will consider in your wisdom whether improvements in that system may yet be made, and particularly whether an uniform process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal courts be not desirable through all the States.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said; [...] "I didn't {{understand}} {{that he was the}} sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> would have been likely to have taken lunch with. But that isn't my affair. Have you seen the second edition?" ...|$|E
60|$|VIOLET. Then {{you don't}} know Hector as I do. He is romantic and faddy--he gets it from you, I fancy--and {{he wants a}} certain sort of wife {{to take care of}} him. Not a faddy sort <b>of</b> <b>person,</b> <b>you</b> know.|$|E
60|$|I {{was fond}} of the man. He was the sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> never get to know very well, but we had been {{together}} for quite a while, and I wouldn't have been a dog if I hadn't got attached to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is {{just such}} another pretty kind <b>of</b> young <b>person.</b> <b>You</b> will like Harriet. Emma {{could not have}} a better {{companion}} than Harriet." ...|$|R
3000|$|Question 5 : If I were to {{show you}} one photo <b>of</b> a <b>person</b> <b>you</b> are {{unfamiliar}} with, how likely {{is it that you}} recognise a different photo <b>of</b> that <b>person</b> at a later date? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poh! poh! you are critical," [...] {{returned}} Claverhouse. [...] "I {{tell you}} I thought you {{a different sort}} <b>of</b> <b>person.</b> Did <b>you</b> ever read Froissart?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tush, Mabel! The Sergeant {{knows what}} the woods be, and what men--true red men--be, too. There is little need to tell him {{anything}} about it. Well, now you have met your father, {{do you find the}} honest old soldier the sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> expected to find?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} depends what sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] said Hewet. He looked at her. She was small and pretty, aged perhaps twenty-eight or twenty-nine, but though dashing and sharply cut, her {{features}} expressed nothing very clearly, except {{a great deal of}} spirit and good health.|$|E
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "--And she {{naturally}} won't believe he's done it. But then, when Miss Rice {{tells her}} it's your handwriting, Amy, she'll {{think that you}} and Miss Rice have been having your jokes about Mr. Welling; and she'll wonder what kind <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> are, anyway, to make free with a young man's name that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|BLOOM: Not to lace {{the wrong}} eyelet as I did {{the night of}} the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Hook in wrong tache <b>of</b> her... <b>person</b> <b>you</b> mentioned. That night she met... Now! ...|$|R

6000|$|ONE of my {{objects in}} writing these lines is to vindicate the {{character}} of an innocent woman (formerly in my service as housekeeper) who has been cruelly slandered. Absorbed {{in the pursuit of}} my purpose, it has only now occurred to me that strangers may desire to know something more than they know now of myself and my friend. [...] "Give us some idea," [...] they may say, [...] "of what sort <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>you</b> are, if you wish to interest us at the outset of your story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear young lady," [...] he said, [...] "it is {{very good}} of you to be so sympathetic, but I am afraid I am not at all the sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> imagine me to be. What I was before those ten years--well, I have forgotten. What I am now, I {{unfortunately}} know. I am a soured, malevolent being whose only pleasure lies in the dealing out to others some portion of the unhappiness which was dealt out to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you like}} punch, you'll {{allow me to}} order a glass apiece, as hot {{as it can be}} made, that we may usher in our {{friendship}} in a becoming manner. To let you into a secret, Mr Pinch, I never was so much in want of something warm and cheering in my life; but I didn't like to run the chance of being found drinking it, without knowing what kind <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> were; for first impressions, you know, often go a long way, and last a long time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha!" [...] said Tell. [...] "Oho! so it's you, is it? I know you. And a nice sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> are, {{with your}} taxes on bread and sheep, aren't you! You'll {{come to a}} bad end one of these days, that's {{what will happen to}} you. Oh, you old reprobate! Pooh!" [...] And he had passed on with a look of scorn, leaving Gessler to think over what he had said. And Gessler ever since had had a grudge against him, and was only waiting for a chance of paying him out.|$|E
50|$|From pandalam it is {{very easy}} to go to cherickal. Go to the autorikshaw stand in front of pandalam panchayath. Approach an autorikshaw driver, Tell the name <b>of</b> the <b>person</b> <b>you</b> want to meet. He will direct you on the right way.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{exactly to}} the kind <b>of</b> <b>person</b> that <b>you</b> wanted, a man who will take a pride, {{although}} merely a tenant, in not permitting his poor neighbours to feel the want of a landlord. You will never guess: Lord Mildmay!' ...|$|R
5000|$|In February 2007, {{as part of}} {{the celebration}} of Black History Month, St. John was honored at the White House by President George W.

6000|$|... "They're {{taking it}} in. Mainly they grasp {{the fact that}} he's going to jilt Adeline, just as he jilted the American girl. The mermaid side they seem to boggle at. Old people like that don't take to a new idea all at once. The Wampach ones are shocked--but curious. They don't believe {{for a moment she}} really is a mermaid, but they want to know all about it. And the one down at the Pavilion simply said, 'Bosh! How can she breathe under water? Tell me that, Mrs. Bunting. She's some sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> have picked up, I don't know how, but mermaid she cannot be.' They'd be all tremendously down on the mater, I think, for picking her up, if it wasn't that they can't do without her help to bring Addy round again. Pretty mess all round, eh?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{turned out}} to be one of those rich and rare fall days which is just a June day toned down to a degree where it is heaven to be out of doors. Toward noon the guests arrived, and we {{assembled}} under a great tree and were soon as sociable as old acquaintances. Even the king's reserve melted a little, though it was some little trouble to him to adjust himself to the name of Jones along at first. I had asked him to try to not forget that he was a farmer; but I had also considered it prudent to ask him to let the thing stand at that, and not elaborate it any. Because he was just the kind <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> could depend on to spoil a little thing like that if you didn't warn him, his tongue was so handy, and his spirit so willing, and his information so uncertain.|$|E
6000|$|And {{he answers}} her: [...] "I {{believe you are}} the only one now alive who {{remember}}s me as a child. I have heard of you from time to time, but I wonder what sort <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>you</b> are now. Perhaps if I did know I wouldn't dare put pen to paper. But I don't know. I only remember that we were great chums. In fact, I chummed with you even more than with your brothers. But I am like the pigeon that went away in the fable of the Two Pigeons. If I once start to tell you I would want you to feel that you have been there yourself. I may overtax your patience with the story of my life so different from yours, not only in all the facts but altogether in spirit. You may not understand. You may even be shocked. I say all this to myself; but I know I shall succumb! I have a distinct recollection that in the old days, when you were about fifteen, you always could make me do whatever you liked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All very {{proper and}} legal, I believe, Sir Reginald?--I am glad you think so, sir. Now, Sir Wycherly, {{we wait for}} the name <b>of</b> the lucky <b>person</b> <b>you</b> mean thus to favour." ...|$|R
6000|$|The face of {{the cashier}} {{appeared}} troubled. [...] "I think, sir," [...] she said, [...] "that if you leave the money, Mr Candy will do all he can to discover what you wish to know, {{and that it will}} not be very long before you have the address <b>of</b> the <b>person</b> <b>you</b> are seeking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We don't want to {{hear all}} this nonsense," [...] the {{magistrate}} said angrily. [...] "We want a list <b>of</b> <b>persons,</b> not what <b>you</b> said to them." ...|$|R
