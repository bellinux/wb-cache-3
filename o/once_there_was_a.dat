During the war, Steinbeck accompanied the commando raids of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.'s Beach Jumpers program, which launched small-unit diversion operations against German-held islands in the Mediterranean. At one point, he accompanied Fairbanks on an invasion of an island off the coast of Italy and helped capture Italian and German prisoners, using a Tommy Gun.

25|$|Despite {{his lack}} of learning, Trần Thủ Độ was praised as a skilled and devoted {{official}} of the Trần Dynasty, the ruling dynasty which was found by his very own effort. As a result, the grand chancellor held a position in royal court which was so powerful that he was suspected by some of overruling the Emperor. <b>Once</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> person {{who went to the}} Emperor to report him about this suspicion, Thái Tông immediately visited Trần Thủ Độ's place with this man and made him tell everything in front of the grand chancellor. After hearing the story, Trần Thủ Độ not only accepted that the man had somewhat his reason but also awarded him for being concerned for the Trần Dynasty. His successful governing was considered by historical books as the main factor that not only led to the stability of Early Trần period but also contributed to the victory of Đại Việt over the first Mongol invasion.|$|E
500|$|Edgar ruled as {{a strong}} and popular king for 16 years. In 975 he was succeeded by his eldest son Edward [...] "the Martyr". His {{accession}} was disputed by his stepmother, Ælfthryth, who wished her own son Æthelred to reign. Through the influence of Dunstan, Edward was chosen and crowned at Winchester. Edgar's death had encouraged the reactionary nobles, and at <b>once</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> determined attack upon the monks, the protagonists of reform. Throughout Mercia they were persecuted and deprived of their possessions. Their cause, however, was supported by Æthelwine, the ealdorman of East Anglia, and the realm was in serious danger of civil war. Three meetings of the Witan were held to settle these disputes, at Kyrtlington, at Calne, and at Amesbury.

500|$|Bird {{studied and}} {{categorised}} {{the collection of}} stones at Guy's, concentrating particularly on the crystal structures of the nuclei, since stone formation followed <b>once</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> nucleus on which to form. [...] He considered the chemistry of the nuclei {{to be the most}} important aspect of stone formation. [...] Bird identified many species of stone, classified by the chemistry of the nucleus, but determined that they all fell within two overall groups: organic stones caused by a misfunctioning bodily process, and excessive inorganic salts causing sediment on which the stone could nucleate. [...] In 1842, Bird became the first to describe oxaluria, sometimes called Bird's disease, which is caused by an excess of oxalate of lime in the urine.Lee, p. 27Talbott, p. 599Schmidt, p. 342 [...] This is the second most common cause of kidney stones, the first being uric acid and its ammonium salt. [...] There are several others, such as ammonium oxalate. [...] In his great work Urinary Deposits, Bird devotes much space to the identification of chemicals in urine by microscopic examination of the appearance of crystals in it. [...] He shows how the appearance of crystals of the same chemical can vary greatly under differing conditions, and especially how the appearance changes with disease. [...] Urinary Deposits became a standard text on the subject; there were five editions between 1844 and 1857. [...] In the fourth edition Bird added a recommendation to wash out the bladder in cases of alkaline urine, after an experiment by Snow showed that stale urine became alkaline when fresh urine was slowly dripped into it. [...] Bird knew that alkaline urine encouraged phosphate precipitation and the consequent encrustation and stone formation. [...] The last edition of Urinary Deposits was updated after Bird's death by Edmund Lloyd Birkett.Coley, pp. 371–372Payne and McConnellRosenfeld, 1999, p. 50Vinten-Johansen, p. 109 ...|$|E

This has been a disappointment at times for Mahal, who recognizes {{there is a general}} lack of interest in blues music among many African Americans today. He has drawn a parallel comparison between the blues and rap music in that they both were initially black forms of music that have come to be assimilated into the mainstream of society. He is quoted as saying, [...] "Eighty-one percent of the kids listening to rap were not black kids. <b>Once</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> tremendous amount of money involved in it... they totally moved it over to a material side. It just went off to a terrible direction." [...] Mahal also believes that some people may think the blues are about wallowing in negativity and despair, a position he disagrees with. According to him, [...] "You can listen to my music from front to back, and you don't ever hear me moaning and crying about how bad you done treated me. I think that style of blues and that type of tone was something that happened as a result of many white people feeling very, very guilty about what went down." ...|$|E
