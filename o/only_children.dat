Macdonald's formal schooling ended at 15, a common school-leaving age at a time when <b>only</b> <b>children</b> from the most prosperous families were able to attend university. Nevertheless, Macdonald later regretted leaving school when he did, remarking to his secretary Joseph Pope that if he had attended university, he might have embarked on a literary career.|$|E

5|$|The AACAP {{guidelines}} {{state that}} children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others.

5|$|The {{primitive}} early mines of Cornwall and Devon {{probably were}} operated by local extended families, with the men, {{women and children}} all working. Men and boys probably worked both above the surface and below ground, and women and girls worked only above ground; there is no archaeological evidence for women and children working underground in Bronze Age Britain, although some mines from the period contain tunnels so small that <b>only</b> <b>children</b> or very short adults could have worked in them.|$|E

Skinner agrees, so Alex and Lisa, {{accompanied}} by Sherri, Terri, Janey and Allison visit the mall to purchase party supplies, but the girls detour and begin trying on outfits for the dance, despite Lisa's protests. The group leave the mall, none speaking to each other. Lisa decides not to attend the dance, but changes her mind {{and goes to the}} school to take tickets at the door, but later arrives and discovers the boys and girls are standing on different sides of the room, and explains to Alex that it is like this because they are <b>only</b> <b>children,</b> not adults.|$|E
40|$|According to {{incomplete}} statistics, {{the number}} of families that have lost their <b>only</b> <b>child</b> had reached {{more than one million}} in China currently, following an annual increase by 76, 000. The problem of elder care of these families that have lost their <b>only</b> <b>child</b> has become a hot issue in China.

5|$|Chen Guangcheng, a blind self-taught Weiquan lawyer, rose to {{prominence}} for defending victims of China's one-child policy. First implemented in 1979, the one-child policy mandates that couples may {{only have one}} child, though there are exceptions for some rural citizens, ethnic minorities, and couples who were themselves <b>only</b> <b>children.</b> Though Chinese laws condemn harsh enforcement measures, Chinese authorities and family planning staff {{have been accused of}} carrying out coercive, late-term forced abortions, sterilization, incarceration and torture to enforce the policy. In 2005, Chen Guangcheng filed a class action case against family planning officials in Linyi, Shandong, who were accused of subjecting thousands of women to sterilization or forced abortions.|$|E
5|$|The quest {{begins when}} Link is {{chosen by the}} king of Hyrule to seek {{the help of the}} Picori after Vaati had {{destroyed}} the Picori Blade and petrified Princess Zelda. With the blade shattered, evil monsters were released into Hyrule and Vaati was able to create chaos in his search for the Light Force. Link was chosen because <b>only</b> <b>children</b> can see the Picori. On the voyage he rescues Ezlo, a strange being resembling a green cap with a bird-like head, who joins him and can make Link shrink {{to the size of the}} Minish. Although it is not revealed at first, he and Vaati are Minish (Picori)—Ezlo a renowned sage and craftsman and Vaati his apprentice. Vaati became corrupted by the madness and hatred of men and took a magic hat Ezlo had made for the people in Hyrule. The hat grants any wish made by the bearer, and Vaati wished to become a powerful sorcerer. Vaati then turned his old master, who had tried to stop them, into a hat. With the help of Ezlo, Link retrieves the four elemental artifacts and uses them to restore the Picori Blade to the Four Sword, capable of defeating Vaati.|$|E

Like the MTR, the KCR did not provide a concessionary fare for students, although there was a student discount system available for students who lived in Tuen Mun, Yuen Long and Tin Shui Wai. Fares on the East Rail, Ma On Shan Rail, West Rail and the Light Rail (Octopus fare system only) were based on the distance between the start and end points of the journey. The Light Rail implemented a zone-based fare system for single journey tickets; there are six zones in total.|$|E
25|$|When Botvinnik {{finished}} the school curriculum, he was below the minimum age for the entrance examinations for higher education. While waiting, he qualified {{for his first}} USSR Championship final stage in 1927 as the youngest player ever at that time, tied for fifth place and won the title of National Master. He wanted to study Electrical Technology at the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute and passed the entrance examination; however, there was a persistent excess of applications for this course and the Proletstud, which controlled admissions, had a policy of admitting <b>only</b> <b>children</b> of engineers and industrial workers. After an appeal by a local chess official, he was admitted in 1928 to Leningrad University's Mathematics Department. In January 1929, Botvinnik played for Leningrad in the student team chess championship against Moscow. Leningrad won and the team manager, who was also Deputy Chairman of the Proletstud, secured Botvinnik a transfer to the Polytechnic's Electromechanical Department, where {{he was one of}} only four students who entered straight from school. As a result, he had to do a whole year's work in five months, and failed one of the examinations. Early in the same year he placed joint third in the semi-final stage of the USSR Championship, and thus failed to reach the final stage.|$|E
500|$|Both Fishburne and Bassett also {{remarked that}} an {{important}} message of Akeelah and the Bee is to [...] "speak properly" [...] rather than strictly in vernacular, although Bassett {{emphasized the importance of}} the film's themes beyond spelling and spelling bees. Atchison added that beyond learning how to spell words, Akeelah must learn the importance of the words. He said that Larabee [...] "looks at Akeelah as a potential leader. He wants her to understand her history. She needs to know the importance of language – and competition." [...] In spite of knowing its importance, it [...] "deconstruct the 'competition' paradigm of learning", according to Ingman. Fishburne noted not <b>only</b> <b>children</b> but parents can learn from the film; in his opinion, the most important is that they should pay attention to their children's abilities. Villarreal also felt that, through Dylan's father, parents would be able to ponder if they are [...] "push their kids to follow their own dreams and not the children's dreams." ...|$|E

500|$|As well as {{the scale}} of the response, critics {{questioned}} the criteria against which patients were selected for evacuation. At first the UK was challenged over its decision to include <b>only</b> <b>children</b> in the transports while tens of thousands of adults remained wounded in the city. Sylvana Foa, spokesperson for the UNHCR, commented that Sarajevo should not be regarded as a [...] "supermarket" [...] of photogenic potential refugees, asking [...] "Does this mean Britain only wants to help children? Maybe it only wants children under six, or blond children, or blue-eyed children?" [...] Patrick Peillod, head of the United Nations medical evacuation committee, said that the UK had treated Bosnian children [...] "like animals in a zoo" [...] and was trying to pick and choose evacuees to suit a public relations agenda. When the government revised its approach and included adults on flights out of the city, claims were made that wounded combatants had been among those taken to the UK, Sweden, and Italy, and that patients had paid bribes {{to be included in the}} transports.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} universal acclaim. Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film four stars and wrote, [...] "This {{is not simply}} a good movie. It is one of those movies that brush away our cautions and win our hearts." [...] He later added it to his Great Movies list, structuring the essay as a letter to his grandchildren about the first time they watched it. Michael Sragow of Rolling Stone called Spielberg [...] "a space age Jean Renoir.... for the first time, [...] has put his breathtaking technical skills at the service of his deepest feelings". Derek Malcolm of The Guardian wrote that [...] "E.T. is a superlative piece of popular cinema ... a dream of childhood, brilliantly orchestrated to involve not <b>only</b> <b>children</b> but anyone able to remember being one". Leonard Maltin would include it in his list of [...] "100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century" [...] as one of only two movies from the 1980s. George Will {{was one of the few}} to pan the film, feeling it spread subversive notions about childhood and science.|$|E
500|$|Simpson {{was born}} on 30 November 1937 in Haswell, County Durham, the {{youngest}} of six children of coal miner Tom Simpson and his wife Alice (née Cheetham). His {{father had been a}} semi-professional sprinter in athletics. The family lived modestly in a small terraced house until 1943, when his parents took charge of the village's working men's club and lived above it. In 1950 the Simpsons moved to Harworth on the Nottinghamshire–Yorkshire border, where young Simpson's maternal aunt lived; new coalfields were opening, with employment opportunities for him and older brother Harry, by now, the <b>only</b> <b>children</b> left at home. Simpson rode his first bike, his brother-in-law's, at age 12, sharing it with Harry and two cousins for time trials around Harworth. Following Harry, Tom joined Harworth & District CC (Cycling Club) aged 13. He delivered groceries in the Bassetlaw district by bicycle and traded with a customer for a better road bike. He was often left behind in club races; members of his cycling club nicknamed him [...] "four-stone Coppi", after Italian rider Fausto Coppi, due to his slim physique.|$|E
