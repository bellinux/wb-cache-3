2500|$|A {{variation}} of the dowel method for reinforcement {{is the use of}} a Miller dowel in place of the usual straight cylindrical dowel. The Miller dowel is a stepped dowel and is drilled with a special stepped drill bit. [...] It is drilled from the <b>outside</b> <b>face</b> of the frame piece to be joined and therefore generally leaves an exposed dowel protruding after glue dries, and the excess dowell head is thus usually flush cut. [...] The advantages of the special dowel are documented in various media promoting the method, but one advantage that should not be overlooked is speed of assembly. [...] The butt joint can often be joined temporarily and sometimes more accurately with simply glue, allowing faster set up than the usual tedious alignment procedures mentioned above. [...] After the glue dries one or more Miller dowels are then used to reinforce the joint. [...] Dowel trimming and sanding of the surface, followed by normal finishing then proceed in the usual manner. [...] The blind alignment problems of floating dowels are virtually eliminated by the use of the Miller dowel. [...] Not all projects are appropriate for the stepped dowel method if an exposed dowel end is not visually acceptable, however.|$|E
50|$|The stiles and rails {{often have}} a profile cut into the inside edge of the <b>outside</b> <b>face</b> - usually a smaller version to match {{the profile of the}} panel. In some panel styles, a profile may also be cut on the outside edge of the <b>outside</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Nunnery Quadrangle (a {{nickname}} {{given to}} it by the Spanish; it was a government palace) is the finest of Uxmals several fine quadrangles of long buildings. It has elaborately carved fa√ßades on both the inside and <b>outside</b> <b>faces.</b>|$|R
50|$|Directly <b>outside,</b> <b>facing</b> Zable Stadium, is the Elizabeth and T.C. Clarke Memorial Plaza, {{which is}} paved with {{hundreds}} of engraved bricks that commemorate special people, times and places in William & Mary history. The Plaza can seat 250 people for catered events.|$|R
50|$|The Class 220s {{and closely}} related Class 222s have B5005 bogies, which are {{distinctive}} {{as they are}} of inside-frame design and so the axles are supported by bearings behind the wheels, meaning the <b>outside</b> <b>face</b> of the wheel is visible. The related Class 221 Super Voyager has outside-frame bogies and hence a more conventional appearance.|$|E
50|$|A side-effect of {{the cannon}} box {{is that the}} centre of the shaft is now {{enclosed}} and inaccessible. Previously Stephenson had coupled the driving axles of his locomotives with a central chain. The need for an alternate system spurred the development of the coupling rods, where the drive was connected on the <b>outside</b> <b>face</b> of the wheels.|$|E
50|$|Tutte's spring theorem {{states that}} every 3-connected planar graph {{can be drawn}} on a plane without {{crossings}} so that its edges are straight line segments and an <b>outside</b> <b>face</b> is a convex polygon (Tutte 1963). It is so called because such an embedding can be found as the equilibrium position for a system of springs representing {{the edges of the}} graph.|$|E
5000|$|A rake is an {{architectural}} term for an eave or cornice which {{runs along the}} gable end of {{the roof of a}} modern residential structure. It may also be called a sloping cornice, a raking cornice. The trim and rafters at this edge are called rake-, verge-, or barge-board or verge- or barge-rafter. [...] It is a sloped timber on the <b>outside</b> <b>facing</b> edge of a roof running between the ridge and the eave. [...] On a typical house, any gable will have two rakes, one on each sloped side. The rakes are supported by a series of lookouts (sometimes also called strong arms) and may be enclosed with a rake fascia board on the <b>outside</b> <b>facing</b> edge and a rake soffit along the bottom.|$|R

A hill (blurred) is visible in the background...|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} of corrosion {{and the forces}} exerted on it by trains led to the rail snapping. Ultrasonic inspection equipment specified for track inspections was unable to detect <b>outside</b> <b>face</b> cracks of the type thought to {{have led to the}} break. Metronet indicated that it would respond to the incident by using different ultrasound detection equipment, increasing the frequency of track inspections, and preferentially replacing rails rather than turning them around.|$|E
5000|$|EIFS are {{typically}} {{attached to the}} <b>outside</b> <b>face</b> of exterior walls with an adhesive (cementitious or acrylic based) or mechanical fasteners. Adhesives are commonly used to attach EIFS to gypsum board, cement board, or concrete substrates. EIFS are attached with mechanical fasteners (specially designed for this application) when installed over housewraps (sheet-good weather barriers) such as are commonly used over wood sheathings. The supporting wall surface should be continuous (not [...] "open framing") and flat.|$|E
50|$|Box {{ties are}} used to attach the {{scaffold}} to suitable pillars or comparable features. Two additional transoms are put across from the lift {{on each side of}} the feature and are joined on both sides with shorter tubes called tie tubes. When a complete box tie is impossible a l-shaped lip tie can be used to hook the scaffold to the structure, to limit inward movement an additional transom, a butt transom, is place hard against the <b>outside</b> <b>face</b> of the structure.|$|E

5000|$|One {{version of}} a dance called [...] "Cotton-Eyed Joe" [...] {{can be found in}} the 1975 edition of Encyclopedia of Social Dance. This version has the men on the inside of a circle facing out, and the women on the <b>outside</b> <b>facing</b> in. The dance {{consists}} of eight kick steps, side, close left together, right together, and a series of struts.|$|R
50|$|The secret mitred {{dovetail}} joint (also called a mitred blind dovetail, full-blind dovetail, or full-blind mitred dovetail) {{is used in}} the highest class of cabinet and box work. It offers the strength found in the {{dovetail joint}} but is totally hidden from both <b>outside</b> <b>faces</b> by forming the outer edge to meet at a 45-degree angle while hiding the dovetails internally within the joint.|$|R
5000|$|Certain air-deployed munitions, {{particularly}} [...] "dumb" [...] or unguided 500-pound bombs, {{are often}} retrofitted with bolt-on strake sets. Designed as an open collar with strakes fitted to the <b>outside</b> <b>face,</b> these strake sets {{are used to}} alter and normalize the aerodynamics of the weapon, yielding greater accuracy. As most such munitions were manufactured with only tail-mounted stabilizer fins, the addition of longitudinal strakes proves a much cleaner flow of air around the weapon during its glide, reducing the tendency to yaw and improving terminal accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Practice chanters can be {{made out}} of various {{materials}} and come in various sizes: short chanters are designed for the smaller hands of a child; regular chanters (as shown in the photo at right) are the same size is the traditional chanters; long chanters are also available, with the added length allowing a melody hole spacing identical {{to that of the}} bagpipe chanter itself. On some long chanters, the melody holes are also countersunk so that the <b>outside</b> <b>face</b> of the melody holes will have the same diameter as the bagpipe chanter holes.|$|E
50|$|An open structure, the {{car park}} {{consists}} primarily of {{a grid of}} rectangular concrete columns with flared tops supporting waffle slabs which form the floors. Precast concrete panels with an exposed aggregate finish form the balustrades on the Turbot Street and Wickham Terrace elevations. Balustrading elsewhere consists of painted square sectioned steel posts attached to the <b>outside</b> <b>face</b> of the building which support steel pipe handrails. Horizontal steel rods secured with steel springs have been added as supplementary balustrading. The original security screen on the Wickham Terrace elevation {{is a series of}} vertical steel rods fixed to the floor slabs with springs.|$|E
25|$|Both {{buildings}} used {{a structural}} system of steel framing and reinforced concrete. Brick {{is on the}} <b>outside,</b> <b>faced</b> in cast stone. The Knickerbocker, at 72 Hudson, was four stories tall to the Arnink's three; both were three bays wide and flat-roofed. Due to different materials in the composite for the cast stone, the Knickerbocker had a more distinctly golden color, like sandstone, while the Arnink was granite gray.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} a concrete, barrel vaulted deck arch bridge. Its single arch spans 31 ft across Silver Creek. The bridge carries the unpaved Burt Road in a rural, wooded area of Ransom Township in Hillsdale County. The parapet {{railings}} are constructed of solid concrete and have five rectangular recesses {{on the inside}} and <b>outside</b> <b>faces.</b> At the southwest corner is affixed a bridge plate {{on the inside of the}} railing.|$|R
50|$|<b>Outside,</b> <b>facing</b> {{over the}} plaza and towards the mural of Che Guevara on the Ministry of the Interior on the {{opposite}} side of the square, is an 18 m (59 ft) white marble statue of Mart√≠ carved in situ by Sicre and surrounded by six half-height marble columns. The platform where the statue is located is used as a podium when rallies take place in the Plaza de la Revoluci√≥n.|$|R
50|$|In addition, Piet de Jong did {{not produce}} a style of {{documentation}} which would be considered sufficient for modern, quantitative, standards of archaeological recording. Another group of examples is de Jong‚Äôs illustration of ceramic finds. Modern drawings of archaeological ceramics tend to include both a ‚Äúsection‚Äù, or profile drawing, of the vessel and an ‚Äúelevation,‚Äù a depiction of its <b>outside</b> <b>face.</b> In contrast, Piet de Jong‚Äôs illustrations do not include a section and elevation, but rather tend to depict the entire outside profile of the vessel, often from a distorted perspective, {{in order to make}} as many of the object‚Äôs defining attributes visible to the viewer as possible.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inner city}} wall stood 11.4 m high and were topped with battlements that rose a further 1.9 m. [...] The wall, lined with brick {{and filled with}} rammed earth, was 19.8 m thick at the {{foundation}} and 16 m at the top. Bastions protruding on the <b>outside</b> <b>face</b> of the wall are locally known as mamian or [...] "horse face". The bastions, spaced about 80 m apart, allowed archers to fire at attackers from three sides. [...] The restored fortification has 11 bastions on the southern wall and two bastions on the shorter eastern wall. Only the battlements of the corner tower and one bastion has been fully restored.|$|E
50|$|A typical blinky is a {{small metal}} two piece {{cylinder}} wide enough to accept a button cell battery with a very small etched circuit board on the face and threads on the open end, paired with a cylinder cap which screws on to seal and secure as one. The flashing LED circuit board face can be round and enclosed by cylinder, or a variety larger colored shapes such as logos that are glued to the <b>outside</b> <b>face</b> of the cylinder end. Common designs utilize a rubber ring gasket as an on/off switch - when placed between the batteries and circuit board inside the front cover, tightening the screw base deforms and flattens the gasket forcing the battery tip to contact {{the back of the}} printed circuit board which completes the circuit.|$|E
50|$|The temple has {{a simple}} plan {{characteristic}} of Western Ganga constructions. It has a sanctum (garbhagriha), a vestibule (called sukhanasi) that {{connects to the}} sanctum a large well sculptured closed hall (navaranga or mahamantapa) and an open, elevated and detached mantapa <b>outside</b> <b>facing</b> the shrine containing the sculptured image of nandi (the companion of the Hindu god Shiva) facing east (called the nandimantapa). The base on which the temple is raised (called adhishthana) is a simple set of moldings.|$|R
5000|$|A local legend relates that Suwa My≈çjin, who {{originally}} came to Suwa from <b>outside,</b> <b>faced</b> {{resistance from the}} god Moreya, who challenged the new arrival armed with a weapon made of iron - variously identified as an iron ring (ÈâÑËº™) or an iron [...] (ÈâÑÈé∞, ÈâÑÈë∞). Suwa My≈çjin, however, defeated Moreya using only a wisteria branch. After subduing Moreya and other local deities who resisted him, Suwa My≈çjin established himself as the chief god of the region.|$|R
