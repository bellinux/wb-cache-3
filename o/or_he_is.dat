5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy {{designed}} {{to respond to}} the problem of evil. As such, it defends the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is {{the best of all possible}} worlds because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} ways to {{discriminate}} against people based on disabilities, including psychological ones. Anyone known to have a history of mental disorders can be considered disabled. Employers with more than 15 employees must take care to treat all employees fairly and with any accommodations needed. Even when an employee is doing a job exceptionally well, she <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily no longer disabled; employers must continue to follow all policies for the disabled.|$|E
25|$|An {{evolutionary}} psychology explanation for conversion disorder {{is that the}} symptoms may have been evolutionarily advantageous during warfare. A non-combatant with these symptoms signals non-verbally, possibly to someone speaking a different language, that she <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not dangerous as a combatant and also may be carrying some form of dangerous infectious disease. This can explain that conversion disorder may develop following a threatening situation, {{that there may be}} a group effect with many people simultaneously developing similar symptoms (as in mass psychogenic illness), and the gender difference in prevalence.|$|E
25|$|Christ either deceived mankind by {{conscious}} fraud, <b>or</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> Himself deluded and self-deceived, <b>or</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> Divine. There is {{no getting}} out of this trilemma. It is inexorable.|$|R
60|$|Darkness {{and silence}} ruled {{everywhere}} around. Above them rose the primeval yews and oaks of The Chase, {{in which there}} poised gentle roosting birds in their last nap; and about them stole the hopping rabbits and hares. But, might some say, where was Tess's guardian angel? where was the providence of her simple faith? Perhaps, like that other god of whom the ironical Tishbite spoke, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> talking, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> pursuing, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in a journey, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> sleeping {{and not to be}} awaked.|$|R

25|$|The {{specific}} rituals {{engaged in}} by the king are only rudimentarily known. The Post-Classic Kʻicheʻ king together with his dignitaries regularly visited the temples to burn offerings and pray for the prosperity of his people, while fasting and guarding sexual abstinence. As to the Classic Period king, he appears at times (often period-ending dates) to be scattering blood, incense or, perhaps, maize. At other times, the king, represented by the hero Hunahpu, is sacrificing his own blood in front of directional trees (murals of San Bartolo), <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> officiating in front of such a tree (temple sanctuaries of Palenque).|$|E
25|$|His miraculous or mundane birth: In one account, he was fatherless, like Padmasambhāva, who assists his {{celestial}} creation {{by creating}} a nāginī who then serves the king of Ling, and is impregnated by drinking a magic potion, and is born from his mother's head, like Athena in Greek mythology. In another version he is conceived by his mother after she drinks water impressed with his image. Alternatively, he is born from the union of a father, who is simultaneously skygod and holy mountain, and of a mother who is a goddess of the watery underworld, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> born, Chori, in the lineage of Ling in the Dza Valley, to the king Singlen Gyalpo and his spouse Lhakar Drönma of Gog.|$|E
25|$|The {{main body}} of the work states at the {{beginning}} that it assumes prior knowledge of Immanuel Kant's theories, and Schopenhauer is regarded by some as remaining more faithful to Kant's metaphysical system of transcendental idealism {{than any of the other}} later German Idealists. However, the book contains an appendix entitled critique of the Kantian philosophy, in which Schopenhauer rejects most of Kant's ethics and significant parts of his epistemology and aesthetics. Schopenhauer demands that the introduction be read before the book itself, although it is not fully contained in this book but appeared earlier under the title On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason. He also states in his introduction that the reader will be at his best prepared to understand his theories if he has lingered in the school of Plato <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> already familiar with Indian philosophy.|$|E

25|$|Since LGBT {{people began}} to {{organize}} for their social and legal rights, access to equal health care has remained an important but often not primary issue. LGBT-specific health organizations have been formed, including charities educating on specific issues, health clinics, and even professional organizations for LGBT people and their allies. Many of them have advocated for specific changes to various governmental practices, and the ongoing effort to legalize same-sex marriage often includes examples of LGBT people unable to secure health coverage equivalent to that of their heterosexual counterparts. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States includes new protections for LGBT people. Under the ACA insurers can no longer turn someone away just because she <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. In addition, ACA is funding preventive efforts for communities, including {{millions of dollars to}} use evidence-based interventions to address HIV-related health disparities. The Department of Health and Human Services is working with community centers serving the LGBT community to employ proven prevention strategies.|$|E

Cynthia Littleton of Variety described Michael as [...] "one of the most interesting of the Oceanic 815-ers: flawed, tortured, hard to read, volatile, fighting his innate talents, his own worst enemy, at times, and at others, a totally stand-up guy." [...] IGN's Chris Carabott calls Michael a [...] "natural" [...] father. Michael is known for frequently shouting [...] "Walt!", [...] "Where's my son!" [...] and [...] "Have you seen my boy?".|$|E

500|$|Muhney {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the plot point of seducing Rafe broadened Adam's horizons. He said, [...] "What it did was move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly check off. 'He is straight, he is this, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When they did that with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television." [...] Muhney described the character as a [...] "puppeteer" [...] with [...] "survival instinct", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked what he likes about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: [...] "You want to play a catalytic character. You know a troublemaker is good business. You know someone who doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who is going to cause friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters. I have been told by many of my cast members that the role to play is Adam. They say, [...] "If I were to have a choice, the character I would want to play is your role, Adam." ...|$|E
500|$|The Court of Appeals in Lovell affirmed a U.S. District Court order {{upholding}} a frivolous return penalty under [...] Similarly, in United States v. Sloan, the taxpayer's contention [...] {{that he is}} [...] "not {{a citizen}} of the United States, but rather, that he is a freeborn, natural individual, {{a citizen of the}} State of Indiana, and a 'master'not 'servant'of his government" [...] was ruled to be not a legal ground for the argument that the taxpayer was not subject to the federal tax laws; the tax evasion conviction was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Similarly, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit stated, in Powers v. Commissioner: [...] "Powers [...] contends that either he is immune from the tax laws, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a 'slave' to the federal government. This false choice is a creature of Powers' tax protester ideology, not the laws of this Republic." [...] Similarly, in 2008 the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected a taxpayer's argument that gains of an individual's labor could be taxed only if the gains were received from a [...] "federal venue". In that case, the taxpayer's argument—that the IRS had no ability to impose a tax on the taxpayer because he was a citizen [...] "of the several states," [...] but not a [...] "federal U.S. citizen"—was ruled to be frivolous.|$|E
2500|$|God, he says, either {{wishes to}} take away evils, and is unable; <b>or</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> able, and is unwilling; <b>or</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> neither willing nor able, <b>or</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> both willing and able.
