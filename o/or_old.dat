Onset in childhood is much rarer, as is onset in middle <b>or</b> <b>old</b> age.|$|E
5|$|While chrism is {{used only}} for the three sacraments that cannot be repeated, a {{different}} oil is used by a priest or bishop to bless a Catholic who, because of illness <b>or</b> <b>old</b> age, {{has begun to be}} in danger of death.

5|$|During 2005–06, a Bakerloo {{extension}} {{was proposed}} with three route options. The options were extensions to Hayes via Peckham Rye, Beckenham Junction via Camberwell, or Hayes via New Cross. In July 2011, Network Rail recommended {{an extension of}} the Bakerloo line from Elephant & Castle to Lewisham, where it would take over the line to Hayes. In September 2014, Transport for London ran a consultation on the Bakerloo extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction with options via Lewisham and Camberwell <b>or</b> <b>Old</b> Kent Road, taking over Network Rail's Hayes line. The cost of the extension is estimated at around £2–3 billion with construction expected to take place between the mid-2020s and early 2030s. A February 2017 consultation indicates that the line could extend to Lewisham via Old Kent Road with future extension options later on.|$|E

Methods which remove the minimum amount of structural material are indicated. Solvents, detergents and bead blasting are generally used. Removal of coatings by the application of heat may render the cylinder unserviceable by affecting the crystalline microstructure structure of the metal. This is a particular hazard for aluminium alloy cylinders, {{which may not be}} exposed to temperatures above those stipulated by the manufacturer.|$|E

5|$|Granite {{intrusions}} {{are found}} in the parish of Barvas in west Lewis, and another forms the summit plateau of the mountain Roineabhal in Harris. The granite here is anorthosite, and is similar in composition to rocks found in the mountains of the Moon. There are relatively small outcrops of Triassic sandstone at Broad Bay near Stornoway. The Shiant Isles and St Kilda are formed from much later tertiary basalt and basalt and gabbros respectively. The sandstone at Broad Bay was once thought to be Torridonian <b>or</b> <b>Old</b> Red Sandstone.|$|E
5|$|Heathen festivals {{can be held}} on {{the same}} day each year, {{although}} they are often celebrated by Heathen communities on the nearest available weekend, so that those practitioners who work during the week can attend. During these ceremonies, Heathens often recite poetry to honor the deities, which typically draw upon or imitate the Early Medieval poems written in Old Norse <b>or</b> <b>Old</b> English. Mead or ale is also typically drunk, with offerings being given to deities, while fires, torches, or candles are often lit. There are also regional meetings of Heathens known as Things. At these, religious rites are performed, while workshops, stalls, feasts, and competitive games are also present. In the U.S., there are two national gatherings, Althing and Trothmoot.|$|E
5|$|However, {{too many}} horses and mules died of {{diseases}} <b>or</b> <b>old</b> age {{before they even}} reached the battlefield and the army ordered an inquiry. In 1917, Vizzini was sentenced to 20 years in first instance for fraud, corruption and murder, but he was absolved thanks to powerful friends who exonerated him. He made his fortune {{on the black market}} during World War I, and expanded his activities to the sulphur mines. As a representative of a consortium of sulphur mine operators, Vizzini participated in high-level meetings in Rome and London concerning government subsidies and tariffs, next to such men as Guido Donegani of Montecatini chemical industries and , Finance minister during Benito Mussolini’s fascist regime.|$|E

5|$|M-204 {{was first}} {{designated}} on July 12, 1933 between Leland and Suttons Bay along what is today Duck Lake Road. The highway was paved {{by the middle}} of 1936. The road was realigned on July 13, 1939, across the narrows of Lake Leelanau in the village of the same name. Another realignment near Suttons Bay was completed on March 26, 1956, to smooth out a curve in the road. A second completed on May 4, 1956, straightened a curve by Sylt Road east of Lake Leelanau. The western section was completely rebuilt between Duck Lake Corner and the Lake Leelanau Narrows Bridge to smooth out curves in the roadway. Sections not obliterated by the reconstruction were turned over to local control as Main Street <b>or</b> <b>Old</b> M-204 in Lake Leelanau when the project was finished on July 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|Members of the red-breasted {{nuthatch}} superspecies excavate their own tree holes, although most other nuthatches use natural holes <b>or</b> <b>old</b> woodpecker nests. Several species {{reduce the size}} of the entrance hole and seal up cracks with mud. The {{red-breasted nuthatch}} makes the nest secure by daubing sticky conifer resin globules around the entrance, the male applying the resin outside and the female inside. The resin may deter predators or competitors (the resident birds avoid the resin by diving straight through the entrance hole). The white-breasted nuthatch smears blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.|$|E
5|$|NYU houses {{approximately}} 11,000 {{undergraduate and}} graduate residents, and had the seventh-largest university housing system in the U.S. as of 2007, {{and one of the}} largest among private schools.

In general, NYU residence halls receive favorable ratings, and some are opulent. Many rooms are spacious and contain amenities considered rare for individual college residence hall rooms, such as kitchens, lavatories, living rooms and common areas. The university operates its own transit system to transport its students by bus to its campus.|$|E

5|$|Tamil dialects are {{differentiated}} by the phonological {{changes and}} sound shifts in their evolution from classical <b>or</b> <b>old</b> Tamil (3rd century BCE–7th century CE). The Sri Lankan Tamil dialects form {{a group that}} is distinct from the dialects of the modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala states of India. They are classified into three subgroups: the Jaffna Tamil, the Batticaloa Tamil, and the Negombo Tamil dialects. These dialects are also used by ethnic groups other than Tamils such as the Sinhalese, Moors and Veddhas. Tamil loan words in Sinhala also follow the characteristics of Sri Lankan Tamil dialects.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} fossils of the closely related Mapusaurus {{were found in}} a bonebed {{consisting}} of several individuals at different growth stages. In their 2006 description of the genus, Coria and Currie suggested that though this {{could be due to}} a long term or coincidental accumulation of carcasses, the presence of different growth stages of the same taxon indicated the aggregation was not coincidental. In a 2006 National Geographic article, Coria stated that the bonebed was probably the result of a catastrophic event, and that the presence of mainly medium-sized individuals, with very few young <b>or</b> <b>old,</b> is normal for animals that form packs. Therefore, Coria said, large theropods may have hunted in groups, which would be advantageous when hunting gigantic sauropods.|$|E
