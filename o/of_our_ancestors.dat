This is not victory, which is gained over ourselves. In killing these, you drive the sword into your own entrails. How many men have you slaughtered? How many more have you to kill?

25|$|The {{fear of the}} end of {{life and}} its {{existence}} is in other words the fear of death. The fear of death ritualized the lives <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>ancestors.</b> These rituals were designed to reduce that fear; they helped collect the cultural ideas that we now have in the present. These rituals also helped preserve the cultural ideas. The results and methods of human existence had been changing {{at the same time that}} social formation was changing. One can say that the formation of communities happened because people lived in fear. The result of this fear forced people to unite to fight dangers together rather than fight alone.|$|E

25|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the Ancient Roman custom of crucifixion may have developed out of a primitive custom of arbori suspendere—hanging on an arbor infelix ("inauspicious tree") dedicated to the gods of the nether world—is rejected by William A. Oldfather, who shows that this form of execution (the supplicium more maiorum, punishment {{in accordance with the}} custom <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>ancestors)</b> consisted of suspending someone from a tree, not dedicated to any particular gods, and flogging him to death. Tertullian mentions a 1st-century AD case in which trees were used for crucifixion, but Seneca the Younger earlier used the phrase infelix lignum (unfortunate wood) for the transom ("patibulum") or the whole cross. Plautus and Plutarch are the two main sources for accounts of criminals carrying their own patibulum to the upright stipes.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the mammoth}} steppe the wolf's ability to hunt in packs, to share risk fairly among pack members, and to {{cooperate}} moved {{them to the}} top of the food chain above lions, hyenas and bears. Some wolves followed the great reindeer herds, eliminating the unfit, the weaklings, the sick and the aged, and therefore improved the herd. These wolves had become the first pastoralists hundreds of thousands of years before humans also took to this role. The wolves' advantage over their competitors was that they were able to keep pace with the herds, move fast and enduringly, and make the most efficient use of their kill by their ability to [...] "wolf down" [...] a large part of their quarry before other predators had detected the kill. The study proposed that during the Last Glacial Maximum, some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>ancestors</b> teamed up with those pastoralist wolves and learned their techniques. Many <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>ancestors</b> remained gatherers and scavengers, or specialized as fish-hunters, hunter-gatherers, and hunter-gardeners. However, some ancestors adopted the pastoralist wolves' lifestyle as herd followers and herders of reindeer, horses, and other hoofed animals. They harvested the best stock for themselves while the wolves kept the herd strong, and this group of humans was to become the first herders and this group of wolves was to become the first dogs.|$|E

Development of the height is primarily determined genetically, but an environment has a partly influence. An evolutionary view is very important, especially {{in the identification of}} fossils at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary and the overal view on individual development to 2. 5 million years ago and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>ancestor.</b> This bachelor thesis summarized the methods how to estimate the most accurate body height of fossil Homo and compares individuals between them. It also focuses on the geographic area of genus Homo not only on the period {{and if there is a}} correlation with increase or decrease in the height of an individual. The main finding of this work is diversity within species Homo. Homo habilis had reached the height of range 120 - 155 cm. In contrast, Homo ergaster measured up to about 170 cm. While Australopithecines were lower growth. Australopithecus were tall on average around 114 cm and Paranthropus exceeded them at range 10 cm. Slight differences in body height can be seen in the context of sexual dimorphism. The climate in Plio-Pleistocene had no influence on the change in height.
