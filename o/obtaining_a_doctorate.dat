5|$|Stokvis {{was born}} to Rachel Wittering and Joseph Barend Stokvis, Jr., a Jewish {{physician}} and obstetrician in Amsterdam. He studied medicine in Amsterdam and at the University of Utrecht under Franciscus Donders and Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk, <b>obtaining</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctorate</b> on a dissertation on hepatic glucose production in diabetes in 1856. His thesis appeared shortly {{after the publication of}} related work by the French physiologist Claude Bernard. Stokvis may also have been influenced by the chemist Gerardus Mulder in Amsterdam. Subsequently, he travelled to Paris and Vienna (and possibly Prague), before establishing himself in medical practice in Amsterdam. He continued his medical research under the physiologists Adriaan Heynsius, Wilhelm Kühne and Thomas Place. In 1867, the Brussels Academy awarded a gold medal to Stokvis for an essay on the development of albuminuria, a kidney disorder in which the protein albumin can be detected in the urine.|$|E
