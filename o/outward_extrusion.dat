50|$|The {{outer wall}} of Doerfel retains {{much of its}} {{original}} form, {{but it has been}} rounded and slightly eroded by a history of subsequent bombardment. Many tiny craterlets lie on or near the rim, especially along the western edge. There is a slight <b>outward</b> <b>extrusion</b> in the southern rim, and the opposite, northern rim appears somewhat jumbled and eroded.|$|E
40|$|Slices {{of kidney}} cortex of {{two species of}} hibernating mammals (hamsters and ground squirrels) have been leached of K, and their {{subsequent}} ability to reaccumulate K in vitro has been determined at temperatures between 38 ° and 0 °C. At 5 °C (body temperature of a hibernating mammal) uptake is appreciable in kidney cortex of both species. In the kidney cortex of hamsters, for example, the tissue K of slices incubated at 5 °C reaches the same steady-state concentration after 2 hours that is observed in slices at 38 °C after 20 minutes. At 0 °C {{there is also a}} measurable uptake. This K transport is blocked by metabolic inhibitors and, in ground squirrel kidneys, by ouabain. In kidney cortex slices from guinea pigs net K accumulation is slight at 5 °C and absent at 0 °C. The initial rapid uptake of K at 38 °C occurs at the same rate in kidney cortex slices of hamsters as in those of rabbits. Lowering the temperature of incubation decreases this initial rate of uptake in hamster kidney slices with a Q 10 of 1. 8 between 38 ° and 15 ° and of 5. 7 between 15 ° and 0 °C. In hamsters this uptake of K has been shown to require the <b>outward</b> <b>extrusion</b> of Na. Conversely, about half of the <b>outward</b> <b>extrusion</b> of Na requires K in the medium, while the remainder appears to be independent of K. The conclusions warranted are that kidney cells of hibernators possess an unusual ability to transport ions at low temperature, that this ability does not depend upon a more rapid rate at higher temperatures, and that the characteristics of transport at low temperature are qualitatively similar to those at 38 °C in cells of nonhibernators...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{evolution}} of shallow magma plumbing systems at short-lived, basaltic volcanoes such as Sinker Butte, in the western Snake River Plain of Idaho, gives insight into the potential behavior and hazards at current and future volcanic centers. Its extensive outcrops are conducive to examining how the lava flows and tephra units shaped the magma plumbing system of the volcano. Fifteen dikes and several additional intrusive sheets are exposed around the eastern and southern sides of Sinker Butte. Twelve of the dikes are oriented in a radial pattern around the capping mesa that is interpreted {{to have been a}} lava lake within the tuff cone 2 ̆ 7 s crater. This pattern is indicative of <b>outward</b> <b>extrusion</b> from one or more central magma chambers. The dikes are exposed for up to 450 m along strike and are between 28 and 133 cm in width. All of the dikes and lava flows at Sinker Butte are tholeiitic and contain phenocrysts of plagioclase and olivine. The asymmetrical patterns of a few suggest that they had enough time to solidify before another magma pulse intruded. Most of the dikes have symmetrical patterns of vesicles and phenocrysts across their widths, indicative of a single continuous magma pulse. Greater quantities of phenocrysts in the dike interiors suggest the grains were concentrated by flow differentiation. Chemical differences in the dikes mostly result from the modal percentages of phenocrysts in a sample. Samples with more phenocrysts contain more of the elements included in plagioclase and olivine. Subsequently, specimens with higher total phenocryst contents have lower concentrations of elements excluded from both minerals. The magma that formed dikes J, M, and N has a different magmatic history than that of the other dikes, because they have unique excluded trace element ratios. These dikes are also distinguished from the others by geographic region and relation to sills. Dikes J, M, and N do not continue stratigraphically below the sills they merge with indicating that either the dikes fed the sills or visa-versa. The preferred intrusion hypothesis for the remaining radial dikes is based on flow directions derived by anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility analyses. Flow directions within the dikes indicate sources at various depths beneath the lava lake at the summit of the volcano. It is assumed that the lava lake existed prior to dike propagation and had crystallized to the point that magma could no longer be extruded. Mounting pressure caused fractures to radiate from several places along the vertical central magma conduit that had fed the lava lake, filling with magma. As dike propagation continued, the tops of the dikes eventually reached the surface causing flank eruptions and the bench lava flows. The breakout point at the distal end of Dike D was likely formed in this manner. Once the source of the magma was tapped, gravity would have caused the final flow directions within the dikes to tilt downward, especially in the sections directly beneath the lava flows. This is confirmed by the steep maximum AMS axes inclinations at the drill sites closest to the bench basalts. Also, cavities were found where the tops of dikes K and G meet the bench basalts...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHuman red cells {{suspended}} in lead-citrate buffers (2. 6 μM Pb 2 +) take up much less Pb than predicted {{from studies of}} equilibrium binding of Pb to haemolysates. Pb uptake is increased by ATP depletion, or by loading at 0 °C. Tracer studies with 203 Pb indicate that the low uptake at 37 °C {{in the presence of}} substrate is not due to membrane impermeability to Pb. Cold-loaded cells extrude Pb against a concentration gradient at 37 °C when glucose is present. These results suggest that the cellular loading of Pb is dependent on the balance between an inward leak and an <b>outward</b> pump. The <b>extrusion</b> of Pb from the cells is possibly brought by the Ca pump...|$|R
