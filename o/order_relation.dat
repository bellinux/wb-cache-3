5|$|There {{are many}} different, but equivalent, axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic. While some axiomatizations, {{such as the}} one just described, use a {{signature}} that only has symbols for 0 and the successor, addition, and multiplications operations, other axiomatizations use the language of ordered semirings, including an additional <b>order</b> <b>relation</b> symbol. One such axiomatization begins with the following axioms that describe a discrete ordered semiring.|$|E
5|$|All of the Peano axioms {{except the}} ninth axiom (the {{induction}} axiom) are statements in first-order logic. The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication and the <b>order</b> <b>relation</b> {{can also be}} defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction is in second-order, since it quantifies over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), {{but it can be}} transformed into a first-order axiom schema of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom.|$|E
25|$|Consider all {{languages}} of finite structures with a fixed signature including a linear <b>order</b> <b>relation.</b> Then, all such languages in P {{can be expressed}} in first-order logic {{with the addition of}} a suitable least fixed-point combinator. Effectively, this, in combination with the order, allows the definition of recursive functions. As long as the signature contains at least one predicate or function in addition to the distinguished <b>order</b> <b>relation,</b> so that the amount of space taken to store such finite structures is actually polynomial in the number of elements in the structure, this precisely characterizes P.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{mathematics}} {{is grounded in}} the study of equivalences, and <b>order</b> <b>relations.</b> Lattice theory captures the mathematical structure of <b>order</b> <b>relations.</b> Even though equivalence relations are as ubiquitous in mathematics as <b>order</b> <b>relations,</b> the algebraic structure of equivalences is not as well known as that of orders.

40|$|Summary. Some theorems about well <b>ordering</b> <b>relations</b> are proved. The goal of {{the article}} is to prove that every two well <b>ordering</b> <b>relations</b> are either {{isomorphic}} or {{one of them is}} isomorphic to a segment of the other. The following concepts are defined: the segment of a relation induced by an element, well founded <b>relations,</b> well <b>ordering</b> <b>relations,</b> the restriction of a relation to a set, and the isomorphism of two relations.

25|$|Underlying every Boolean algebra B is a {{partially}} ordered set or poset (B,≤). The partial <b>order</b> <b>relation</b> is defined by x ≤ y just when x= x∧y, or equivalently when y= x∨y. Given a set X of elements of a Boolean algebra, an upper bound on X is an element y such that for every element x of X, x ≤ y, while a lower bound on X is an element y such that for every element x of X, y ≤ x.|$|E
25|$|Low-dimensional {{comparability}} graphs: The comparability graph for {{a partially}} ordered set has a vertex for each set element and an edge between two set elements that are related by the partial order. The order dimension of a partial order is the minimum number of linear orders whose intersection is the given partial order. If a partial order has bounded order dimension, then an adjacency labeling scheme for the vertices in its comparability graph may be defined by labeling each vertex with its position {{in each of the}} defining linear orders, and determining that two vertices are adjacent if each corresponding pair of numbers in their labels has the same <b>order</b> <b>relation</b> as each other pair. In particular, this allows for an adjacency labeling scheme for the chordal comparability graphs, which come from partial orders of dimension at most four.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{classification}} method of alternatives for multiple preference ordering criteria based on the concept of fuzzy majority. The fuzzy majority is represented by a fuzzy quantifier, and applied in the aggregation by means of an OWA operator whose weights are calculated by the fuzzy quantifier. For every preference ordering criterion we derive a preference <b>ordering</b> <b>relation</b> and from the set of preference <b>ordering</b> <b>relations</b> we derive a collective preference <b>ordering</b> <b>relation,</b> distinguishing between the two experts' opinions intensity possibilities, i. e. homogeneous group and heterogeneous group.
