5000|$|On his death, it was said, [...] "They'll {{probably}} {{call it the}} Matthews funeral," [...] {{in reference}} to Mortensen's <b>overshadowing</b> <b>by</b> Stanley Matthews after the 1953 FA Cup Final. His funeral was held at St John's parish church, Blackpool, and he was cremated at Carleton Crematorium in Carleton, Lancashire.|$|R

5|$|Also {{in eastern}} Slavonia, the Lovas {{massacre}} occurred in October and the Erdut massacre in November 1991, {{before and after}} the fall of Vukovar. At the same time, the Škabrnja massacre occurred in the northern Dalmatian hinterland; it was largely <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> the events at Vukovar.|$|E
5|$|At home to Juventus, Arsenal won 2–0 with goals from Fàbregas and Henry; {{the match}} was <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> {{the return of}} former captain Vieira. A goalless draw at the Stadio delle Alpi meant the club progressed into the semi-finals against Villarreal.|$|E
5000|$|Lacassagne's <b>overshadowing</b> <b>by</b> the Lombroso School was {{probably}} due to his insistence {{on the value of}} phrenology, which at that time had become decredited in most scientific circles. Criminology was at the time divided into two main schools - one relative more to [...] "biopsychological" [...] theories stressing the importance of individual traits and aiming at establishing an essential difference between honest citizens and criminals, the other opposed to this medical determinism social determinism, mainly influenced by Durkheim. Lacassagne's approach, which combined both biological and social factors, was too ambiguous to last.|$|R
60|$|With a quick {{movement}} {{the alert}} young fellow had vaulted into the saddle. But, to the astonishment {{of both of}} us, the mare remained perfectly still. There was Enriquez bolt upright in the stirrups, completely <b>overshadowing</b> <b>by</b> his saddle-flaps, leggings, and gigantic spurs the fine proportions of Chu Chu, until {{she might have been}} a placid Rosinante, bestridden by some youthful Quixote. She closed her eyes, she was going to sleep! We were dreadfully disappointed. This clearly would not do. Enriquez lifted the reins cautiously! Chu Chu moved forward slowly--then stopped, apparently lost in reflection.|$|R

5|$|Jackson was {{inducted}} into the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1982. Despite his record and achievements, defensive standouts were <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> power hitters in Hall of Fame balloting. He was also inducted in the Arkansas Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Ronnie James Dio left Black Sabbath in November 1982 {{to start}} his own band, and took drummer Vinny Appice with him. Live Evil was {{released}} in January 1983, but was <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> Ozzy Osbourne's platinum selling album Speak of the Devil.|$|E

40|$|In 1680 Cassini {{proposed}} oval curves as alternative trajectories for {{the visible}} planets around the sun. The Cassini ovals were of course <b>overshadow</b> <b>by</b> the Kepler's first law (1609), namely the planets {{move around the}} sun describing conic orbits. Here we describe {{the possibility that the}} Cassini's idea works at larger or smaller scales. Indeed, we consider the Spiric curves (which are a generalization of the Cassini oval) and present the first steps towards a Spiric gravitational theory. We show that from our formalism an ellipse associated with a planet can be obtained as a particular case. Comment: 11 pages, Late...|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Canada has a {{well-developed}} media sector, but {{its cultural}} output; particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines, is often <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> imports from the United States. As a result, {{the preservation of}} a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and {{institutions such as the}} Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{retirement}} in Australia, the next 5 rounds saw {{a string of}} point-scoring positions, including a 4th at Monaco in the wet, {{one of the few}} finishers not to have made a mistake and subsequent pit-in, however his performance was <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> Hamilton's win. Until 2009, this was Webber's best start to an F1 season since 2005 with Williams, managing five consecutive points scoring races.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Luxembourg {{was allowed}} to retain its own {{government}} and political system, but all proceedings were <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> the German army's presence. Despite the overbearing distraction of the occupation, the Luxembourgish people attempted to lead their lives as normally as possible. The political parties attempted to focus on other matters, such as the economy, education, and constitutional reform.|$|E
5|$|In May 2000, Vagrant Story was {{the fifth}} best-selling PlayStation title of the month. 100,000 units were sold in the first 20 days of the game's release, despite being <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> other Square titles like Final Fantasy IX and Chrono Cross. Vagrant Story was the third of twenty games to date, and the only game on the PlayStation, to receive a perfect score of 40 from Famitsu magazine.|$|E

50|$|As Berlin's least {{inhabited}} district, it {{has been}} <b>overshadowed</b> historically <b>by</b> its neighboring boroughs Prenzlauer Berg and Pankow. However its popularity is increasing due to its proximity to the hip but expensive Prenzlauer Berg. Its trams make reaching Mitte very convenient.|$|R
5|$|Kentucky's {{football}} program was <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> its successful basketball program during Collier's tenure. Collier was also criticized for his poor recruiting skills, a crucial factor for college coaches. Many fans wrote {{the university to}} complain about him and his staff. Still, several future star coaches served as assistants under Collier at Kentucky, including Don Shula, Chuck Knox, Howard Schnellenberger and Bill Arnsparger. Standout players under Collier included All-Americans Lou Michaels and Schnellenberger.|$|E

Other interests included science and technology, shared by her father Prince Albert, and horseback riding and boating, two of her favourite childhood occupations. However, Helena became a middle daughter following the birth of Princess Louise in 1848, and her abilities were <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> her more artistic sisters.|$|E
5|$|Metformin {{was first}} {{described}} in the scientific literature in 1922, by Emil Werner and James Bell, as a product in the synthesis of N,N-dimethylguanidine. In 1929, Slotta and Tschesche discovered its sugar-lowering action in rabbits, finding it the most potent biguanide analog they studied. This result was completely forgotten, as other guanidine analogs, such as the synthalins, took over and were themselves soon <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> insulin.|$|E
40|$|The {{projection}} of the sun on and into buildings is normally analysed {{with the use of}} a model and heliodon or sundial. This involves making a model and, in order to obtain an accurate record, taking photographs. This process is both time consuming and, since models are not readily altered, tends to be employed at the later stages of design when built form is finalised. The method proposed here is quick to use and, being graphical, allows for easier experimentation with built form at an earlier stage in design. It will also aid in decisions concerning solar shading <b>by</b> canopies, <b>overshadowing</b> <b>by</b> obstructions, the duration of sunshine on a surface, shadow projection and the penetration of sunshine into rooms...|$|R
