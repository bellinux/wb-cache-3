40|$|Traditional {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} architectures are based on low-power microcontrollers and highly integrated short range radio transceiver chips operating {{in one of the}} few ISM bands. This combination provides a convenient and proven approach to design and build inexpensive sensor nodes rapidly. However, the black box nature of these radio chips severely limit experimentation and research with novel and innovative technologies in the wireless infrastructure. <b>Our</b> <b>team</b> <b>previously</b> proposed a revolutionary architecture for wireless nodes based on Flash FPGA devices. This paper shows the initial results of our work through the implementation and evaluation of a simple baseband FSK modem in the SmartFusion FPGA fabric. We also demonstrate how we could leverage existing software radio projects to use the baseband modem in a wide range of radio frequency bands. Finally, the paper describes our approach and implementation of power management and instrumentation, a key building block in our modularized low-power software radio platform...|$|R
