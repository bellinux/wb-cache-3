Although CBC Perth continued as a day school until 1961, Aquinas inherited the college colours red and black, {{as well as the}} college honour boards, achievements and history for the period 1894-1937. The inheritance was largely due to the driving efforts of Brother C.P. Foley who was headmaster of CBC Perth and the founding headmaster of Aquinas.

Claire Hodgson from the same publication described the clip as a [...] "beautifully shot, brilliantly acted short film", which [...] "really does not hold back when it comes to portraying the real horror of sexual assault in the most graphic way possible". Emily Shire from The Daily Beast was positive about the clip, calling it: [...] "both chilling and beautiful.

The brutality of these snapshot scenes are remarkably moving in the scariest and most sickening way possible". However, Shire was disappointed with one aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> – that the victims are supported by their friends and close-ones and that was enough to cope through the trauma. Instead Shire wanted to see the legal ramifications of such traumatic incidents, with the victims going to the police. Shire concluded the review saying: [...] "Gaga and Hardwicke deserve props for creating such a powerful, visceral, and aesthetically striking PSA. They've brought a tremendous amount of attention to rape and sexual assault. Yet, attention alone is inadequate balm for the victims of rape."

40|$|Interannual {{rainfall}} variability over Tasmania {{is examined}} using observations and reanalysis data.

The Pacific–South American mode (PSA), El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the southern annular mode (SAM) each show clear influences on <b>the</b> interannual variability <b>of</b> Tasmanian rainfall. Composites of rainfall during each phase <b>of</b> ENSO and <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> suggest a notable islandwide influence of these climate modes on Tasmanian rainfall.

40|$|Disseminated {{intravascular}} coagulation (DIC) is {{the most}} common complication of solid tumours. In this study, <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> three polysaccharide anticoagulants (PSAs), at therapeutic doses, at inhibiting solid tumour growth was investigated.

At these concentrations, these PSAs are equieffective at inhibiting blood coagulation activated factor X. In mice with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumours dalteparin and, to a lesser extent, UFH inhibited both tumour growth and angiogenesis, whereas danaparoid did not. In contrast, in mice with KLN 205 tumours, all <b>the</b> <b>PSAs</b> inhibited tumour growth and angiogenesis.

In both LLC and KLN 205 tumours in vivo, heparanase activity was inhibited by UFH and dalteparin, but not by danaparoid. Hence, UFH and dalteparin may be more effective than danaparoid at inhibiting cancer progression in DIC patients with solid tumours, due at least in part to their ability to suppress VEGF and heparanase in tumours...|$|R
