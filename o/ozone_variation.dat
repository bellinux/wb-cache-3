40|$|Analysis {{of global}} ozone {{variations}} {{for the period}} April 1970 to December 1975 was performed by using the reprocessed Nimbus 4 backscattered ultraviolet (BUV) measurements of total ozone. A correlation coefficient of 0. 97 is found between the 6 -month running mean of global mean total ozone (filtered for mean semiannual, annual, and quasibiennial variations) and the 10. 7 -cm solar activity index. Correcting ozone for a time-dependent latitudinal bias relative to Dobson ozone measurements reduces to 2 - 3 % the global mean <b>ozone</b> <b>variation</b> over the solar cycle.

Using the middle-atmosphere model of Garcia and Solomon (1983), the monthly variations of the ozone mixing ratio were computed and Fourier-analyzed, with excellent agreement found between the computed values and those measured with the SBUV instrument. It was found that, at high latitudes and low altitudes, the modeled ozone abundances increased in the winter due to transport and decreased in the summer due to chemical destruction. In the middle stratosphere, the calculated annual <b>ozone</b> <b>variation</b> {{was found to be}} largely due to the annual variation in the odd-oxygen production rate, while in the upper stratosphere, the annual <b>ozone</b> <b>variation</b> was found to be caused by the large annual oscillation in temperature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The total <b>ozone</b> <b>variations</b> over Europe (∼ 50 ◦ N) in {{the period}} 1964 – 2004 are {{analyzed}} for detection of signals of ozone recovery. The ozone deviations from the longterm monthly means (1964 - 1980) for selected European stations, where the ozone observations (by the Dobson spectrophotometers) {{have been carried out}} continuously for at least 3 – 4 decades, are averaged and examined by a regression model. A new method is proposed to disclose both the <b>ozone</b> trend <b>variations</b> and date of the trend turnaround. The regression model contains a piecewise linear trend component and the terms describing the ozone response to forcing by “natural ” changes in the atmosphere.

40|$|The {{statistical}} {{relationship between}} springtime and summertime ozone over middle and polar latitudes is analyzed using zonally averaged total <b>ozone</b> data. Shortterm <b>variations</b> in springtime midlatitude ozone demonstrate {{only a modest}} correlation with springtime polar <b>ozone</b> <b>variations.</b> However by early summer, <b>ozone</b> <b>variations</b> throughout the extratropics are highly correlated. Analysis of correlation functions indicates that springtime midlatitude ozone, not polar ozone, is the best predictor for summertime polar ozone. Long-term total ozone trends at middle and high latitudes are also different for spring and nearly identical for summer.

40|$|Previous {{multiple}} regression analyses of the solar cycle variation of stratospheric ozone are improved by (1) analyzing three independent satellite ozone data sets with lengths extending up to 25 years and (2) comparing column ozone measurements with ozone profile data during the 1992 – 2003 period when no major volcanic eruptions occurred. Results show that the vertical structure of the tropical ozone solar cycle response has been consistently characterized by statistically significant positive responses in {{the upper and lower}} stratosphere and by statistically insignificant responses in the middle stratosphere (∼ 28 – 38 km altitude). This vertical structure differs from that predicted by most models. The similar vertical structure in the tropics obtained for separate time intervals (with minimum response invariably near 10 hPa) is difficult to explain by random interference from the QBO and volcanic eruptions in the statistical analysis. The observed increase in tropical total column ozone approaching the cycle 23 maximum during the late 1990 s occurred primarily in the lower stratosphere below the 30 hPa level. A mainly dynamical origin for the solar cycle total <b>ozone</b> <b>variation</b> at low latitudes is therefore likely. The amplitude of the solar cycle <b>ozone</b> <b>variation</b> in the tropical upper stratosphere derived here is somewhat reduced in comparison to earlier results.

40|$|Eight {{years of}} Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) ozone data are {{examined}} to study zonal mean variations associated with stratospheric planetary wave (warming) events.

The specific aim is to develop spatial LUR models for two Swedish cities, Umeå and Malmö, as well as a temporal model for Malmö in order to assess ozone exposure for long term epidemiological studies. For the spatial model we measured ozone, using Ogawa passive samplers, as weekly averages at 40 sites in each study area, during three seasons.

GMCA is used to identify the most important patterns of co-variability between interannual <b>ozone</b> mixing ratio <b>variations</b> in the Antarctic region and temperature, zonal, meridional and vertical velocities between 100 and 10 hPa in the same region. The most important two pairs of GMCA time coefficients show large year-to-year variations and trends, which are connected {{with the growth of}} the Antarctic Ozone Hole and the increase of ozone depleting substances. The associated spatial patterns of <b>ozone</b> <b>variations</b> may be characterized as being quasi-symmetric and asymmetric about the pole.

40|$|It {{is noted}} that the region of strongest {{relationship}} between tropical stratospheric zonal winds and total ozone (that is, maximum ozone associated with strong west winds) is in the tropics, in the midlatitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, and, it is thought, at high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The observed period of the ozone quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) decreases from 27 months at the equator to approximately 24 months in midlatitudes, possibly due to local modification of the QBO, as it propagates poleward.

40|$|Monitoring of {{the near}} {{ultraviolet}} (UV) solar irradiance is important because the solar UV radiation is the primary energy source in the upper atmosphere. The solar irradiance at wavelengths shortward of roughly 300 nm heats the stratosphere via photodissociation of ozone in the Hartley bands. Shortward of 242 nm the solar UV flux photodissociates O 2, which is then available for ozone formation. Upper stratosphere <b>ozone</b> <b>variations</b> coincident with UV solar rotational modulation have been previously reported (Gille et al., 1984). Clearly, {{short and long term}} solar irradiance observations are necessary to separate solar-forced <b>ozone</b> <b>variations</b> from anthropogenic changes.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{modeling}} of altitude-dependent patterns of <b>ozone</b> <b>variations</b> over time. Umkher ozone profiles (quarter of Umkehr layer) from 1978 to 2011 are investigated at two locations: Boulder (USA) and Arosa (Switzerland). The study consists of two statistical stages. First we approximate ozone profiles employing an appropriate basis. To capture primary modes of <b>ozone</b> <b>variations</b> without losing essential information, a functional principal component analysis is performed as it penalizes roughness of the function and smooths excessive variations {{in the shape of the}} ozone profiles. As a result, data driven basis functions are obtained. Secondly we estimate the effects of covariates – month, year (trend), quasi biennial oscillation, the Solar cycle, arctic oscillation and the El Niño/Southern Oscillation cycle – on the principal component scores of ozone profiles over time using generalized additive models. The effects are smooth functions of the covariates, and are represented by knot-based regression cubic splines. Finally we employ generalized additive mixed effects models incorporating a more complex error structure that reflects the observed seasonality in the data. The analysis provides more accurate estimates of influences and trends, together with enhanced uncertainty quantification. We are able to capture fine variations in the time evolution of the profiles such as the semi-annual oscillation. We conclude by showing the trends by altitude over Boulder. The strongly declining trends over 2003 – 2011 for altitudes of 32 – 64 hPa show that stratospheric ozone is not yet fully recovering...|$|R

40|$|Thirty-eight {{latitudinal}} {{cross sections}} of stratospheric ozone observed by the SAGE (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment) and SBUV (Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet) satellite instruments {{on the same}} days in March and April 1979 and at approximately the same latitude are compared. Differences in the zonal-mean mixing ratios are found. At pressures less than 5 mbar, SAGE gives approximately 20 percent larger mixing ratios at tropical latitudes (after a correction has been applied for the expected diurnal <b>variation</b> of <b>ozone).</b> The uncorrelated portion of the SBUV variances are smaller than the SAGE noise variances at altitudes above 10 mbar, which indicates that the SBUV experiment should provide excellent detectability of longitudinal <b>ozone</b> <b>variations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{depletion}} {{of the ozone layer}} is {{recognized as one of the}} Earth's most important environmental issues. The Antarctic ozone hole is recognized as one of the most striking indicators of ozone depletion. The location of the ozone hole is generally confined to the latitudes over Antarctica, although there are occasions when the ozone hole can move over lower latitudes locations such as South America. In this activity, students will study <b>ozone</b> <b>variations</b> over different cities to examine how ozone normally changes month to month. In the second part of the analysis, they will determine if and when the ozone hole occurs over these cities. Educational levels: Middle school, High school...|$|R
