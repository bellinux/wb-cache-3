5|$|As Union forces {{advanced}} south, {{the infrastructure}} {{near the town}} of Marionlocated in Southwest Virginia <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Fork of the Holston River, between Saltville and Wythevillebecame a major objective of Union forces. Marion itself was politically divided, with citizens fighting for the Union and the Confederacy. Until the winter of 1864, the town's location in a mountainous region had protected it from major fighting. In November 1864, George Stonemandeputy commander of the Department of the Ohio and in charge of all Union cavalry units in eastern Tennesseeproposed an expedition into southwest Virginia to disrupt the production of supplies and facilities beneficial to the Confederacy. This gained the approval of Maj. Gen. John Schofield on December 6, 1864.|$|E

5|$|At times, some ox cart trains {{did not go}} all the way through, {{but were}} {{supplemented}} by river craft. First flatboats and then shallow-draft steamboats ascended the Minnesota River to Traverse des Sioux and upstream points, where they were met by cart brigades travelling the West Plains Trail. In 1851, weekly steamboat service on the Mississippi began between Saint Anthony Falls and Sauk Rapids <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> and Woods trails. In 1859, steamboat machinery was carried overland to the Red River where a boat was built, but service was intermittent. The Dakota War of 1862 and the American Civil War delayed further improvements.|$|E
5|$|Grassland on the Helvellyn range {{has been}} heavily overgrazed for many years, yet it {{supports}} {{a diversity of}} acid grassland species including sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) on the summit ridge, matgrass (Nardus stricta) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> slopes, and fescue-bent swards on the lower slopes. The Nardus grasslands are the haunt of the scarce mountain ringlet butterfly (Erebia epiphron), the only alpine species of butterfly found in Britain. Acidic flushes (areas of water seepage) with their carpets of sphagnum mosses are common. Less common are basic flushes, which support a greater diversity of species.|$|E
5|$|Hygrometer: Prototype {{hygrometers}} were devised {{and developed}} in the hills during the Western Han dynasty in Ancient China to elucidate mechanisms of long-range meteorological fluctuations. The Chinese used a bar of charcoal and a lump of earth: its dry weight was taken and then compared with its damp weight after being exposed in the air. The differences in weight was used to tally the humidity level. Other techniques were applied using mass to measure humidity such as when the air was dry, the bar of charcoal would be light while the air was humid, the bar of charcoal would be heavy. By hanging a lump of earth and a bar of charcoal on the two ends of a staff separately and adding a fixated lifting string <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> point to make the staff horizontal in dry air, an ancient hygrometer was made.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the ancient}} sources detail plots that Galerius made on Constantine's life in the months {{following}} Diocletian's abdication. They assert that Galerius assigned Constantine to lead an advance unit in a cavalry charge through a swamp <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> Danube, made him enter into single combat with a lion, and attempted to kill him in hunts and wars. Constantine always emerged victorious: the lion emerged from the contest in a poorer condition than Constantine; Constantine returned to Nicomedia from the Danube with a Sarmatian captive to drop at Galerius' feet. It is uncertain how much these tales can be trusted.|$|E
5|$|The Caspian expeditions of the Rus' were {{military}} raids {{undertaken by}} the Rus' between 864 and 1041 on the Caspian Sea shores, of what are nowadays Iran, Dagestan, and Azerbaijan. Initially, the Rus' appeared in Serkland in the 9th century traveling as merchants along the Volga trade route, selling furs, honey, and slaves. The first small-scale raids {{took place in the}} late 9th and early 10th century. The Rus' undertook the first large-scale expedition in 913; having arrived on 500 ships, they pillaged in the Gorgan region, in the territory of present-day Iran, and more to the west, in Gilan and Mazandaran, taking slaves and goods. On their return, the northern raiders were attacked and defeated by the Khazars in the Volga Delta, and those who escaped were killed by the local tribes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> Volga.|$|E

5|$|The corps {{was formed}} {{for a second}} time in 1942 under the command of Major General Vasily Koptsov and became part of the 3rd Tank Army. It first saw combat in the {{unsuccessful}} Kozelsk Offensive of late August and early September, a relatively small operation to encircle a German salient, which resulted in the corps taking heavy losses in proportion to the territory gained. After spending {{the rest of the year}} in reserve, receiving new supplies and equipment, the corps was transferred to the southern front in southwestern Russia to fight in the Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive during January 1943, in which it played a key role by forming part of the forces that encircled thousands of Axis troops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Don River.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} narrow, extending between the first molars. The back margins of the zygomatic plates, the flattened front portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are located before the first molars. Like its close relatives Lundomys and Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys has spinous processes on its zygomatic plates. These genera also share relatively simple posterolateral palatal pits, perforations of the palate near the third molar. Unlike Holochilus and Lundomys, however, Pseudoryzomys has a flat palate, lacking a ridge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> that extends {{along the length of}} the palate. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the third molars, are excavated beyond the level of the palate, but not as deeply as in Holochilus and Lundomys. The mastoid skull bone contains a conspicuous opening, as in most oryzomyines.|$|E

5|$|Affeldt's final {{start of}} the year came on July 23, in a game he won against Minnesota. After the start, the Royals moved him to the bullpen to try to fix his blister problems.

He picked up two more saves before the end of the year and finished with a 76 record and a 3.93 ERA. After the season, to try to help with his blister problems, he had part of a fingernail <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> finger of his left hand removed.
