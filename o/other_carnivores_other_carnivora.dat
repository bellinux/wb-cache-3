40|$|The {{crab-eating fox}} (Cerdocyon thous) is found {{throughout}} Brazil. It has a nocturnal habit {{and can be}} seen on roadsides, where it looks for remains of run over animals and, therefore, it is also a victim of roadkill. This study aimed to characterize the macro and microscopic anatomy of the digestive system of the crab-eating fox. It helps to carry out medical and surgical procedures, besides important information on the feeding strategies, especially for wild individuals needing veterinary care after rescue in cases of running over, burnings, and floods caused by the filling of hydroelectric reservoir lakes or even in projects on captive breeding and restocking. Samples were collected from the digestive system of three wild animals in the region of Guarapuava-PR region. The crab-eating foxes under study were longer than the average reported for the species, had a shorter intestine, and a lower small intestine/body length ratio than <b>other</b> <b>carnivores,</b> besides <b>other</b> anatomical and histological characteristics different from those found in the literature on carnivores...|$|R

50|$|Symptoms {{and host}} range: The virus' hosts {{are found in}} the orders Primates (humans, apes and monkeys), <b>Carnivora</b> (cats, dogs and <b>other</b> <b>carnivores),</b> Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla (single and double-toed hooved mammals).|$|R
5|$|The species dwells in semi-deserts, savannah, open woodland, dense dry woodland, and mountainous forests up to 4,000m in altitude. It {{is scarce}} or absent in {{tropical}} rainforests and coastal areas. Its preferred habitats in west Africa include the Guinea and Sudan savannahs, and is absent in the belt of dense coastal forest. In the Namib Desert, {{it occurs in}} riverine growth along seasonal rivers, the sub-desertic pro-Namib and the adjoining inland plateau. In ideal habitats, the spotted hyena outnumbers <b>other</b> large <b>carnivores,</b> including <b>other</b> hyena species. However, the striped and brown hyena occur at greater densities than the spotted species in desert and semi-desert regions. Population densities based on systematic censuses vary substantially, from 0.006 to 1.7 individuals per km2.|$|R
50|$|Its {{front teeth}} are sharp {{like those of}} <b>other</b> <b>carnivores,</b> but its molars lock {{together}} {{in a way that}} allows them to sieve krill from the water, in the manner of the crabeater seal.|$|R
50|$|Adult males feed on otter scats, but {{are also}} {{attracted}} to <b>other</b> <b>carnivore</b> droppings, as well as moist sand. Adult females seem to prefer fermenting fruit and sap oozing from wounds in tree trunks and branches.|$|R
25|$|The {{consumption}} of dog meat {{continued in the}} 1920s. In 1937, a meat inspection law targeted against trichinella was introduced for pigs, dogs, boars, foxes, badgers, and <b>other</b> <b>carnivores.</b> Dog meat has been prohibited in Germany since 1986.|$|R

50|$|The fauna {{population}} of the park mainly includes blackbucks, wolves, Macqueen's bustards, hyenas and lesser floricans, with foxes, jackals and jungle cats as the main <b>carnivores.</b> <b>Other</b> species include wild pigs, hares and rodents typical of the savannah type grasslands and thorn scrubs.|$|R

5000|$|People {{living in}} areas where the A(H5N1) virus has {{infected}} birds are advised to keep their cats indoors. [...] "Cats can be infected through the respiratory tract. Cats can also be infected when they ingest the virus, which is a novel route for influenza transmission in mammals. But cats excrete only one-thousandth the amount of virus that chickens do ... The concern is that if large numbers of felines and <b>other</b> <b>carnivores</b> become infected, the virus might mutate in a series of events that could lead to an epidemic among humans. Dogs, foxes, seals, and <b>other</b> <b>carnivores</b> may be vulnerable to A(H5N1) virus infection, Dr. Osterhaus said.

50|$|Linguatula serrata is a {{cosmopolitan}} zoonotic parasite, {{belonging to the}} tongueworm order Pentastomida. They are wormlike parasites of the respiratory systems of vertebrates.
