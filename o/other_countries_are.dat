5|$|An {{individual}} {{currency devaluation}} has to involve a corresponding {{rise in value}} {{for at least one}} other currency. The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, the offsetting rise for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> <b>are</b> often content to accept a small rise in the value of their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Sukhoi {{embarked}} on a second modernization of the Su-27 {{to serve as an}} interim aircraft awaiting the development of the Sukhoi PAK FA (Su-57) program. Also known as Su-35, this derivative has a redesigned cockpit and weapons-control system compared to the Su-27M, and features thrust-vectoring engines in place of the omitted canards. The type made its first flight in February 2008. Although the aircraft was designed for export, the Russian Air Force in 2009 became the launch customer of the aircraft, the production version of which is designated Su-35S. China's People's Liberation Army Air Force is the sole foreign user of the aircraft. <b>Other</b> <b>countries</b> <b>are</b> reportedly in discussions with Russia about the possible purchase of the Su-35, among which is Indonesia, whose government is expected to sign a contract in the near future.|$|E

5|$|While {{mercury and}} zinc {{minerals}} {{are found in}} large enough quantities to be mined, cadmium is too similar to zinc and therefore is always present in small quantities in zinc ores from where it is recovered. Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran. At {{the current rate of}} consumption, these reserves are estimated to be depleted sometime between 2027 and 2055. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and one estimate found that about 109 million tonnes of that remains in use. In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan. Several <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> <b>are</b> believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents. Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.|$|E
