40|$|Abstract—The peng-Robinson (PR), a cubic {{equation}} <b>of</b> <b>state</b> (EoS), {{is extended}} to polymers {{by using a}} single set of energy (A 1, A 2, A 3) and co-volume (b) parameters per polymer fitted to experimental volume data. Excellent results for the volumetric behavior of the 11 polymer up to 2000 bar pressure are obtained. The EoS {{is applied to the}} correlation and prediction of Henry constants in polymer solutions comprising three polymer and many nonpolar and polar solvents, including supercritical gases. The correlation achieved with two adjustable parameter is satisfactory compared with the experimental data. As a result, the present work provides a simple and useful model for the prediction of Henry‘s constant for polymer containing systems including those containing polar, nonpolar and supercritical fluids. Keywords—Equation <b>of</b> <b>state,</b> <b>Henry‘s</b> constant, Peng-Robinson, Polymer solution...|$|R

The pirate also confessed that he burned the cargo of an American vessel to throw off the authorities. The defendants' social status and association with criminal (or outlaw) elements dictated the course of events. Captain José Madrazo served as judge and prosecutor of the one-day trial.
