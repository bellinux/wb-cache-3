6000|$|... "Fixed him?" [...] Old Benson {{looked out}} upon the glade. [...] "By the great Jehosophat!" [...] he roared. [...] "Gone and shot a buffalo all by your lone selves! <b>Or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dead {{when you got}} here?" [...] he added suspiciously.|$|E
60|$|Gale {{dismounted}} to {{lead his}} horse, to go forward more slowly. He had ridden sixty miles since morning, and he was tired, and a not entirely healed wound in his hip made one leg drag a little. A mile up the arroyo, near its head, lay the Papago Well. The need of water for his horse entailed a risk that otherwise he could have avoided. The well was on Mexican soil. Gale distinguished a faint light flickering through the thin, sharp foliage. Campers were at the well, and, whoever they were, no doubt they had prevented Ladd from meeting Gale. Ladd {{had gone back to}} the next waterhole, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> hiding in an arroyo to the eastward, awaiting developments.|$|E
5000|$|Micheaux {{was criticized}} by D. Ireland Thomas, a {{columnist}} with the Chicago Defender, for his casting of light-skinned African Americans. Thomas questioned whether Micheaux was [...] "relying on his name alone {{to tell the}} public {{that it is a}} race production; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> after booking it in white theaters.” ...|$|R
40|$|Your {{baby will}} “talk” {{to you in}} many ways. You will soon learn what his looks and {{movements}} mean. For example, when your baby opens his mouth, <b>he</b> may <b>be</b> saying “I’m hungry. ” Crying is also a way your baby can talk to you. Your baby may be too hot, cold, bored, excited, gassy or sleepy; his diaper may need changing; he may want to suck on something; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> sick. The “fussies” will get better over time. This also happens with bottle-fed babies, so it’s NOT your breast milk...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Consul of America with a priest?" [...] {{demanded a}} grave old man, a {{physician}} {{with a beautiful}} silvery beard, and a most reverend and senatorial presence, {{but one of the}} worst tongues in Venice. [...] "Oh!" [...] he added, with a laugh, after scrutiny of the two through his glasses, [...] "it's that crack-brain Don Ippolito Rondinelli. He isn't priest enough to hurt the consul. Perhaps <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> selling him a perpetual motion for the use of his government, which needs something of the kind just now. <b>Or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> posing to him for a picture. He would make a very pretty Joseph, give him Potiphar's wife in the background," [...] said the doctor, who if not maligned would have needed much more to make a Joseph of him.|$|R
60|$|There {{were six}} in the brood. Five were hardy little fellows that made the water boil behind them as they scurried across the lake. But the sixth was a weakling. He had been hurt, by a hawk perhaps, or a big trout, or a mink; or he had {{swallowed}} a bone; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> just a weak little fellow with no accounting for it. Whenever the brood were startled, he struggled bravely {{a little while to}} keep up; then he always fell behind. The mother would come back, and urge, and help him; but it was of little use. He was not strong enough; and the last glimpse I always had of them was a foamy wake disappearing round a distant point, while far in the rear was a ripple where the little fellow still paddled away, doing his best pathetically.|$|E
60|$|The oddest of Philip's masters was {{his teacher}} of French. Monsieur Ducroz was {{a citizen of}} Geneva. He was a tall old man, with a sallow skin and hollow cheeks; his gray hair was thin and long. He wore shabby black clothes, with holes at the elbows of his coat and frayed trousers. His linen was very dirty. Philip {{had never seen him}} in a clean collar. He was a man of few words, who gave his lesson conscientiously but without enthusiasm, {{arriving}} as the clock struck and leaving on the minute. His charges were very small. He was taciturn, and what Philip learnt about him he learnt from others: it appeared that he had fought with Garibaldi against the Pope, but had left Italy in disgust when it was clear that all his efforts for freedom, by which he meant the establishment of a republic, tended to no more than an exchange of yokes; he had been expelled from Geneva for it was not known what political offences. Philip looked upon him with puzzled surprise; for he was very unlike his idea of the revolutionary: he spoke in a low voice and was extraordinarily polite; he never sat down till he was asked to; and when on rare occasions he met Philip in the street took off his hat with an elaborate gesture; he never laughed, he never even smiled. A more complete imagination than Philip's might have pictured a youth of splendid hope, for he must have been entering upon manhood in 1848 when kings, remembering their brother of France, went about with an uneasy crick in their necks; and perhaps that passion for liberty which passed through Europe, sweeping before it what of absolutism and tyranny had reared its head during the reaction from the revolution of 1789, filled no breast with a hotter fire. One might fancy him, passionate with theories of human equality and human rights, discussing, arguing, fighting behind barricades in Paris, flying before the Austrian cavalry in Milan, imprisoned here, exiled from there, hoping on and upborne ever with the word which seemed so magical, the word Liberty; till at last, broken with disease and starvation, old, without means to keep body and soul together but such lessons as he could pick up from poor students, he found himself in that little neat town under the heel of a personal tyranny greater than any in Europe. Perhaps his taciturnity hid a contempt for the human race which had abandoned the great dreams of his youth and now wallowed in sluggish ease; or perhaps these thirty years of revolution had taught him that men are unfit for liberty, and he thought that he had spent his life in the pursuit of that which was not worth the finding. <b>Or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> tired out and waited only with indifference for the release of death.|$|E

His manager, Grant, arrives and urges Joseph to write his next novel after telling him that his {{previous}} book sold over 5 million copies. Joseph begins writing about how after his wife and son died, he lost all faith in a higher power and God, and writes God is dead, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> never alive.|$|E
40|$|As a textual {{critic who}} {{came of age in the}} 2 ̆ 790 s, it is {{difficult}} for me to talk about authorial intention. Indeed, most academics today tell their students to avoid declaring 2 ̆ 2 The message 2 ̆ 2 of a text, encouraging them instead to respect the multivalence of meaning, the slipperiness of poetic discourse, and the freedom of the author to engage discursive play without being pinned down by an absolute interpretation. But I confess that, despite my training, after having watched The Hangover and read all over the Internet about it, I can 2 ̆ 7 t help but wonder if director Todd Phillips is a misogynistic asshole. <b>Or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> just a film director trying to make money by selling a film that denigrates women and celebrates a retrograde version of masculinity. When you live in a culture of rape, either way, it doesn 2 ̆ 7 t really matter...|$|R
50|$|Although Dixon's {{early life}} is largely unknown, the 1860 census lists {{him as a}} 23-year-old native of Kentucky <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> South Carolina. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a {{steamboat}} engineer and had lived in New Orleans, Louisiana before moving to Mobile, Alabama. Dixon's expensive tailor-made uniform and jewellery found on his remains suggests that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a man of some wealth.|$|R
40|$|Don’t {{you just}} love a college town? One morning as I drove north into Lawrence, there beside Highway 59 (or “ 59 Highway, ” as it’s said here) was a stout little {{man in a}} sea green robe striding south, {{counting}} cadence with his wooden staff. I’ll never forget the determination {{on his face and}} the purposeful swing of that staff. He imagined himself a priest or yogi, I suppose, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> really <b>was.</b> Twice this week, some bravely anonymous campus revolutionary slipped broadsides, denouncing me and my colleagues and everything we stand for, under doors all over campus except my own. He imagined himself a Ninja, I suppose, sneaking around in the night. But, real Ninjas don’t waste perfectly good stealth on harmless professors like me, and real Ninjas find the right door if they’ve got something to say. Friends tell me there’s a controversy sweeping through cyberspace that sometimes mentions my name, but not one accuser has a sent a single message directly to me. I don’t subscribe to listservs. As far as I can tell, they were invented for people who can’t draw enough spam on their own. The vast majority of subscribers are conscientious scholars, no doubt, who simply want to keep up with what’s happening in real time. Sadly, however, some of the most active subscribers view cyberbullying as a lively alternative to scholarship. Between these two groups lies a sizable cluster of pseudo‐scholars wh...|$|R
5000|$|Producer Akshay Kumar {{announced}} {{the film in}} 2012. When the promos of the movie were released at first, people heard actor Salman Khan's voice and assumed that he was {{playing a role in}} the movie <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the narrator. Later, the director Umesh Shukla went on to clarify that Salman's voice was only being used in the promos of the movie. The director was quoted telling IANS, [...] "He (Salman) will not be narrating in the film. He has that voice. My film is a light-hearted comedy and we need someone who can do justice to the visuals." ...|$|E
50|$|Wingfield {{obtained}} {{the approval of}} Richard Bancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury, his old London vicar at St. Andrew's, Holborn, for the Reverend Robert Hunt of Old Heathfield (who was in disgrace from his arrival there in 1602 for immorality with his servant, Thomasina Plumber, and for absenteeism and thereby neglect of his congregation). This recruitment may have been {{with the help of}} Richard Hakluyt, Jr., who was also due to sail, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> volunteered by Wingfield's cousin-by-marriage the 3rd Lord De La Warr, the future Governor-General of Jamestown; and Hunt had his will witnessed by a Tristram Sicklemore, so may have already known John Sicklemore aka Ratcliffe. The Archbishop's approval was dated as late as 24 November 1606 - yet, sadly, at the very last moment Hakluyt, the senior of the two priests, backed out.|$|E
50|$|In Parker's {{world there}} is no good or evil, but simply {{different}} styles of crime. There is no law, so Parker cannot be caught, but merely injured or delayed. The subversive implication is not that crime pays, but that all business is crime. Among the Homeric epithets that follow Parker from book to book is: 'He had to be a businessman of some kind. The way he looked, big and square and hard, {{it had to be a}} tough and competitive business; used cars <b>maybe,</b> <b>or</b> jukeboxes.' <b>He</b> <b>is</b> a loner, competing with conglomerates (the syndicate) and fending off marginal elements (psychotics, amateurs). He has no interest in society except as a given, like the weather, and none in power. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> a freebooter who acquires money in order to buy himself periods of vegetative quiet.|$|R

5000|$|After their First Death, Immortals can {{theoretically}} live forever, but in practice, {{it depends}} on their ability to defend their head against an opponent. Joe Dawson puts it so in his Chronicle about Alfred Cahill: [...] "'Immortality' is a relative thing. A new Immortal has the chance to live for untold millennia - maybe even as long as the mythical Methos - <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> all <b>he</b> gets <b>is</b> another week." [...] Methos, the oldest living Immortal, is over 5000 years old, while Richie Ryan has been beheaded at the age of 22. They do not age any more and retain forever the appearance they had when they died for the first time. A First Death happening too early in life can be a hindrance at playing the Game; Kenny is an 800-year-old Immortal who died {{for the first time at}} the age of twelve and has retained the body of a 12-year-old ever since. Immortals are sterile and they have perfect dentition. While Immortals have only slightly more than normal human abilities in Highlander movies and series, in Highlander animated movies and series they have superhuman abilities such as enhanced speed and enormous strength.|$|R

You can {{hear the sound of}} a {{woodpecker}}, and Mohammed's fingers slowly start to move; perhaps <b>he</b> <b>is</b> [...] "reading" [...] the sound with his fingers as if they <b>are</b> Braille dots. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> thinks the woodpecker is giving clues about [...] "the color of God". <b>Or</b> <b>maybe,</b> <b>he</b> has finally touched God.|$|R
60|$|Rabecque <b>was</b> silent. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{ashamed of}} himself; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> that, not agreeing with his master, he had yet {{sufficient}} appreciation {{of his position}} to be discreetly silent where his opinions might be at variance.

50|$|Think {{it all the}} way through, and Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky is a {{scrupulously}} moral picture.
