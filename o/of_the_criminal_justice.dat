Jenkins' run is more traditionally English in its themes, with Albion, Arthurian legend, and old English battles all featuring, and even an appearance by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and a speculative explanation of the writing of Kubla Khan, and what the interruption of the 'man from Porlock' may have been. He also returns to Jamie Delano's coverage of anarchist lifestyles, and the effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Justice</b> Act of 1994, a controversial law which restricted the ability of the public to throw raves and large demonstrations.|$|E
