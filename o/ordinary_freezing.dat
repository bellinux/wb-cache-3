They also are claimed to increase tissue survival without having its water replaced by cryogenically compatible fluids; whether they have any effect is unclear.|$|E
40|$|Cultural objects {{may become}} wet by {{deliberate}} water cleaning, water disaster or water soaked for other reasons. Air drying textile objects and even other organic materials from a water wet state, involves many problems {{depending on the}} strong capillarity action of water. Damages and changes such as bleeding of dyes, stains or lines of impurities from water movement, shrinking or stiffness can occur. Freeze-drying as an alternative drying method has often been used for wet archaeological and marine objects, but more seldom for historical materials. This bachelor thesis addresses {{the issue of whether}} freeze-drying can be an alternative controlled drying method for historic costumes. Costumes and related objects are often composite objects, consisting of multiple materials, as well as being three dimensional, all of which will complicate drying. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether it is possible to handle costume objects after wet cleaning for drying by freeze-drying, and if damages due to surface tension of water, can be avoided in this way. A literature survey was carried out into the characteristics of water, the processes of wetting and drying, the properties of textile and skin, alternative drying methods and the theory of freeze-drying. Another aim of this thesis was to develop a practical procedure based upon experience. Seven case studies are reported. All objects are Sámi costumes: four “gákti”/clothing and three “gahpir”/caps made of textile, with some skin details. The freeze-drying process was carried out without vacuum in an <b>ordinary</b> <b>freezing</b> room. Different procedures and handling of the objects were tested from wet state through freezing, freeze-drying, and to the final air drying. Changes in dimension, colour and staining from water movement was evaluated afterwards. Observations were carried out during the whole drying process on the drying behavior. Appropriate drying equipment and how to decide the drying rate are discussed. The results suggest that freeze-drying can be an alternative drying method and a way to control the drying of historic costumes after wet cleaning. Damages due to air drying should in most cases be avoided by freeze-drying. A method to handle objects before freezing was investigated, in which the goal was to keep the object as wet as possible prior to placing in the freezer. This reduced the risk of damage from water movement and also the pressure of time. Some guidelines are given for practical use...|$|E
40|$|A {{simultaneous}} {{heat and}} mass transfer {{model of the}} dielectric material-assisted microwave freeze drying was derived in this study considering the vapor sublimation-desublimation in the frozen region. The mathematical model was solved numerically by using the finite-difference technique with two moving boundaries. Silicon carbide (SiC) {{was selected as the}} dielectric material, and the skim milk was used as the representative solid material in the aqueous solution to be freeze-dried. The results show that the dielectric material can significantly enhance the microwave freeze drying process. The drying time is greatly reduced compared to cases without the aid of the dielectric material. Profiles of the temperature, ice saturation, vapor concentration, and pressure during freeze drying were presented. Mechanisms of the heat and mass transfer inside the material sphere were analyzed. For an initially unsaturated frozen sample of 16 mm in diameter with a 4 -mm-diameter dielectric material core, the drying time is 288. 2 min, much shorter than 380. 1 min of <b>ordinary</b> microwave <b>freeze</b> drying and 455. 0 min of conventional vacuum freeze drying, respectively, under typical operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|The SN 1987 A in the Giant Magellanic Cloud was {{an amazing}} and {{extraordinary}} event because it was detected in real time for different neutrinos experiments (νs) around the world. Approximate ∼ 25 events were observed in three different experiments: Kamiokande II (KII) ∼ 12, Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven (IMB) ∼ 8 e Baksan ∼ 5, plus a contrived burst at Mont Blanc (Liquid Scintillator Detector - LSD) later dismissed because of energetic requirements (Aglietta et al. 1988). The neutrinos have an important play role into the neutron star newborn: {{at the moment when}} the supernova explodes the compact object remnant is freezing by neutrinos (∼ 99 % energy is lost in the few seconds of the explosion). The work is motivated by neutrinos' event in relation arrival times where there is a temporal gap between set of events (∼ 6 s). The first part of dataset came from the <b>ordinary</b> mechanism of <b>freezing</b> and the second part suggests different mechanism of neutrinos production. We tested two models of cooling for neutrinos from SN 1987 A: 1 st an exponential cooling is an ordinary model of cooling and 2 nd a two-step temperature model that it considers two bursts separated with temporal gap. Our analysis was done with Bayesian tools (Bayesian Information Criterion - BIC) The result showed strong evidence in favor of a two-step model against one single exponential cooling (B_ij > 5. 0), and suggests the existence of two neutrino bursts at the moment the neutron star was born.

40|$|Drying is an {{important}} unit operation. Freeze drying {{is the most expensive}} process of all drying operations. To improve the process economics by reducing drying time {{is one of the key}} research topics. Microwave heating has proved to enhance the freeze drying rate. However, when the dielectric loss factor (a property directly affects the adsorption of microwave energy) of the solid material is low, the effect of microwave heating is insignificant. In addition, microwave heating may cause collapse of the solid matrix if there is an uncontrolled non-uniform microwave adsorption because of the 4000 times higher loss factor of water than ice. In this dissertation, a novel approach - dielectric-material-assisted microwave freeze drying was examined theoretically and experimentally. A dielectric sphere or bar is first frozen with the solution, and then the frozen material is freeze dried with microwave heating. The dielectric material absorbs the microwave energy first and conducts heat to its surrounding in a controlled manner. It has advantages of high product quality, increased drying rate and easy operation. This idea is the first of its kind. Two mathematical models of coupled heat and mass transfer were developed based on Luikov' system of equations and Whitaker's theory. One considers the sublimation-reverse sublimation effect in the unsaturated region, using skim milk and lactose solution as materials, without accounting bound water removal as a separated drying stage. The other one considers the hygroscopic effect in the secondary drying stage using again skim milk as a representative material. The hygroscopic effect was quantified by taking the vapor pressure of water as the product of the moisture saturation and vapor pressure of pure water. The models were solved numerically by using the finite-deference technique with internal movable boundaries. Simulation results show that the dielectric material can significantly enhance microwave freeze drying of aqueous solutions. The drying time can be more than 30 % shorter than those of conventional <b>freeze</b> drying and/or <b>ordinary</b> microwave <b>freeze</b> drying. Based on profiles of the temperature, ice saturation, vapor concentration and pressure, the mechanisms of heat and mass transfer inside the material were analyzed, and the drying rate-controlling factor was discussed. A laboratory-scale freeze drying apparatus with microwave heating ability was designed, constructed and assembled. Experimental studies were performed for conventional freeze drying and dielectric-material-assisted (SiC) microwave freeze drying of mannitol. More than 20 % of drying time was saved for dielectric-material-assisted microwave freeze drying compared to conventional freeze drying under the operating conditions tested. Comparisons between experimental results and model predictions indicate that the hygroscopic relation used in the original model overestimated the experimental data. In fact, the coefficient to account for the hygroscopic effect in freeze drying of mannitol solution should be the square root of moisture saturation, i. e., ratio of equilibrium vapor pressure in adsorption to that in thermodynamics: f(S) =S 1 / 2. Theoretical predictions of the improved model showed good agreements with experimental results...|$|R
