5|$|On 18 January 1966, {{shortly after}} Singapore's independence, the President of Singapore {{appointed}} a Constitutional Commission helmed by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin {{to consider how}} the rights <b>of</b> <b>racial,</b> linguistic, and religious minorities in the nascent nation should be protected. Singapore had just been ejected from Malaysia, and had experienced an extended period <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> and religious tension resulting from the Maria Hertogh riots. This experience reinforced {{the need for a}} multiracial society based on equality among races.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{reputation}} underwent a renaissance during the Reagan administration, modern assessments of Coolidge's presidency are divided. He is adulated among advocates of smaller government and laissez-faire; supporters {{of an active}} central government generally view him less favorably, while both sides praise his stalwart support <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> equality.|$|E
5|$|At independence, the {{policies}} <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> inequality were {{reflected in the}} disease patterns of the black majority. The first five years after independence saw rapid gains {{in areas such as}} immunisation coverage, access to health care, and contraceptive prevalence rate. Zimbabwe was thus considered internationally to have an achieved a good record of health development.|$|E

5|$|Salvatore uses Drizzt to {{represent}} issues <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> prejudice, particularly in The Dark Elf Trilogy.

Drizzt is also troubled by the lifespan discrepancy between himself and Cattie-Brie.|$|E
5|$|Through these years, Trotter {{routinely}} {{wrote in}} the Guardian about incidents <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> injustice, including the 1931 trials of the Scottsboro boys. They had been accused and were convicted of raping two white women in Alabama. Historians have concluded they were innocent.|$|E
5|$|To get to Europe, Trotter {{posed as}} a seaman seeking work in New York, {{and got a}} job as a cook on the SS Yarmouth to gain passage to France. He arrived in Paris alone and with little more than his cook's clothing, only to find that the {{principal}} peace negotiations had already taken place. The powers did not include any statement <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> equality. Trotter attracted the French press in his accounts <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> mistreatment in the United States, but he could not gain access to any of the official delegations to the peace conference. He also missed Du Bois' Pan-African Congress, which was held in February 1919 while he was still seeking passage.|$|E

5|$|While {{the lack}} <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> {{diversity}} provoked {{criticism of the}} Oscar nominations, the omission of Carol from the Best Picture and Best Director categories prompted considerable discussion from journalists on the perceived indifference by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences toward female-centric and LGBT-centric films.|$|E
5|$|After a 1994 {{plan was}} {{approved}} and a bond issue passed, additional elementary magnet schools were opened and district attendance plans redrawn, {{which resulted in}} the Topeka schools meeting court standards <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> balance by 1998.

5|$|Also in 2000, Corzine denied {{having made}} {{payments}} to African-American ministers, although the foundation controlled by Jon and Joanne Corzine had paid one influential black church $25,000. Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, {{director of the}} Black Ministers Council, had campaigned against a form <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> profiling whereby police officers stop minority drivers and had gotten New Jersey state police superintendent, Carl A. Williams, fired. Corzine had donated to Jackson prior to getting {{what appears to be}} a reciprocal endorsement.|$|E
5|$|Although St. Louis {{enforced}} {{a variety}} of Jim Crow laws, the area generally had a lower level <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> violence and fewer lynchings than the American South. The St. Louis black community was stable and relatively concentrated along the riverfront or near the railroad yards. Although informal discrimination had existed in the St. Louis housing market {{since the end of}} the Civil War, only in 1916 did St. Louis pass a residential segregation ordinance. The ordinance quickly was invalidated by court injunctions, but private restrictive covenants in St. Louis real estate transactions limited the ability of white owners to sell to blacks and were another form <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> discrimination. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such real estate limitations as unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a court case based on the sale of a St. Louis house (the Shelley House) to a black family.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these acts}} helped empower courts to remedy {{violations}} of federal voting rights, strict legal standards {{made it difficult}} for the Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation. For example, to win a discrimination lawsuit against a state that maintained a literacy test, the Department needed to prove that the rejected voter-registration applications <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> minorities were comparable to the accepted applications of whites. This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state's counties in a process that could last months. The Department's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials, who would claim to have misplaced the voter registration records <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> minorities, remove registered racial minorities from the electoral rolls, and resign so that voter registration ceased. Moreover, the Department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal district court judges opposed racial minority suffrage. Thus, between 1957 and 1964, the African-American voter registration rate in the South improved marginally even though the Department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits.|$|E

5|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, Weaver's message <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans {{did in the}} face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|As the {{political}} situation deteriorated, Whitlam and his government continued to enact legislation: The Family Law Act 1975 provided for no-fault divorce while the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 caused Australia to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms <b>of</b> <b>Racial</b> Discrimination that Australia had signed under Holt, but which had never been ratified. In August 1975, Whitlam gave the Gurindji people of the Northern Territory title deeds to part of their traditional lands, beginning the process of Aboriginal land reform. The next month, Australia granted independence to Papua New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|Banks was {{divorced}} from Eloyce in 1981. She received several valuable items from his playing career {{as part of}} their divorce settlement, including his 500th home run ball. She sold the items not long after the divorce. He remarried in 1984. In 1993, his third wife Marjorie was part of a group that met with MLB executives to discuss race relations in baseball after allegations <b>of</b> <b>racial</b> slurs surfaced against Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott. Banks married Liz Ellzey in 1997 and Hank Aaron served as his best man. In late 2008, Banks and Ellzey adopted an infant daughter.|$|E
