5|$|Survivors is a British {{science fiction}} {{television}} series {{produced by the}} BBC. It depicts {{the lives of a}} group of people who survived a virulent unknown strain of influenza which has wiped out most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species.</b> According to the producers, the series is not a remake of the 1970s BBC television series Survivors (1975–1977), created by Terry Nation, but rather is loosely based on the novel of the same name that Nation wrote following the first series of the 1970s programme. Two series were produced of the new show: series 1 ran on BBC One and BBC HD in November–December 2008, and series 2 ran in January–February 2010, ending with a cliffhanger. The BBC announced on 13 April 2010 that, due to poor viewing figures and other considerations, Survivors had been cancelled.|$|E

25|$|In 1758, Carl Linnaeus {{proposed}} what {{he considered}} to be natural taxonomic categories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species.</b> He distinguished between Homo sapiens and Homo sapiens europaeus, and he later added four geographical subdivisions of humans: white Europeans, red Americans, yellow Asians and black Africans. Although Linnaeus intended them as objective classifications, his descriptions of these groups included cultural patterns and derogatory stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|England, France, or Germany. This {{approach}} {{defines as}} its object {{the human species}} as a totality. This focus did not lead Boas to seek to reduce all forms of humanity and human activity to some lowest common denominator; rather, he understood the essence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> to be the tremendous variation in human form and activity (an approach that parallels Charles Darwin's approach to species in general).|$|E
5000|$|Substantially larger numbers, such as 500 million deaths, and {{especially}} qualitatively different scenarios such as <b>the</b> extinction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>human</b> <b>species,</b> seem {{to trigger a}} different mode of thinking...

5000|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised by animal rights groups about <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> animals in this context, {{particularly}} due to a concern about <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> autonomy from an independent creature.

25|$|Friedrich Nietzsche held a pessimistic view {{on modern}} society and culture. His views {{stand against the}} concept of popular culture. He {{believed}} the press and mass culture led to conformity and brought about mediocrity. Nietzsche saw a lack of intellectual progress, leading to the decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species.</b> According to Nietzsche, individuals needed to overcome this form of mass culture. He believed some people were able to become superior individuals {{through the use of}} will power. By rising above mass culture, society would produce higher, brighter and healthier human beings.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatry, {{like most}} medical {{specialties}} has a continuing, has significant need for research into its diseases, classifications and treatments. Psychiatry adopts biology's fundamental belief that disease and health are different elements of an individual's adaptation to an environment. But psychiatry also {{recognizes that the}} environment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> is complex and includes physical, cultural, and interpersonal elements. In addition to external factors, the human brain must contain and organize an individual's hopes, fears, desires, fantasies and feelings. Psychiatry's difficult task is to bridge the understanding of these factors {{so that they can}} be studied both clinically and physiologically.|$|E
25|$|Popular {{arguments}} against evolution {{have changed since}} the publishing of Henry M. Morris' first book on the subject, Scientific Creationism (1974), but some consistent themes remain: that missing links or gaps in the fossil record are proof against evolution; that the increased complexity of organisms over time through evolution is not possible due {{to the law of}} increasing entropy; that it is impossible that the mechanism of natural selection could account for common ancestry; and that evolutionary theory is untestable. The origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> is particularly hotly contested; the fossil remains of purported hominid ancestors are not considered by advocates of creation biology to be evidence for a speciation event involving Homo sapiens. Creationists also assert that early hominids, are either apes, or humans.|$|E
50|$|Others {{argue the}} contrary. According to anthropological evidence, for <b>the</b> {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> {{has been in}} existence, humans have lived in a {{manner in which the}} land and resources were not privately owned. Also, when social ranking did occur, it was not antagonistic or hostile like the current class system. This evidence has been used to support the idea that <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> a social class system is unnecessary. Overall, society has neither come to a consensus over <b>the</b> necessity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> class system, nor been able to deal with the hostility and prejudice that occurs because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> class system.|$|R
50|$|C. fasciculata is {{an example}} of a {{non-human}} infective trypanosomatid and is related to several human parasites, including Trypanosoma brucei (which causes African trypanosomiasis) and Leishmania spp. (which cause Leishmaniasis). C. fasciculata parasitizes several species of insects and has been widely used to test new therapeutic strategies against parasitic infections. C. fasciculata is often used as a model organism in research into trypanosomatid biology that may then be applied to understanding <b>the</b> biology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> infective <b>species.</b>|$|R
40|$|When {{taken as}} a serious and dispassionate object <b>of</b> study from <b>the</b> {{standpoint}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> science <b>of</b> pathology, <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> is easily recognized as a global pathogen. Incontrovertible evidence on all sides tells us this, and yet we have steadfastly avoided an honest look in the mirror. We so often choose—willfully and with strong convictions sustained by homocentric prejudice—to hide the facts from ourselves, and to proceed with untroubled ignorance to overlook <b>the</b> worldwide <b>human</b> and natural devastation for which our species is responsible...|$|R
25|$|William Ruddiman has {{proposed}} the early anthropocene hypothesis, {{according to which}} the anthropocene era, as some people call the most recent period in the earth's history when the activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> first began {{to have a significant}} global impact on the earth's climate and ecosystems, did not begin in the 18th century {{with the advent of the}} Industrial Era, but dates back to 8,000 years ago, due to intense farming activities of our early agrarian ancestors. It was at that time that atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations stopped following the periodic pattern of the Milankovitch cycles. In his overdue-glaciation hypothesis Ruddiman states that an incipient glacial would probably have begun several thousand years ago, but the arrival of that scheduled glacial was forestalled by the activities of early farmers.|$|E
25|$|Carl Jung {{believed}} that the collective unconscious, which reflects the cosmic order and the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species,</b> {{is the most important}} part of the mind. It contains archetypes, which are manifested in symbols that appear in dreams, disturbed states of mind, and various products of culture. Jungians are less interested in infantile development and psychological conflict between wishes and the forces that frustrate them than in integration between different parts of the person. The object of Jungian therapy was to mend such splits. Jung focused in particular on problems of middle and later life. His objective was to allow people to experience the split-off aspects of themselves, such as the anima (a man's suppressed female self), the animus (a woman's suppressed male self), or the shadow (an inferior self-image), and thereby attain wisdom.|$|E
25|$|Late in his life, Shockley became {{intensely}} {{interested in}} questions of race, human intelligence, and eugenics. He thought {{this work was}} important to the genetic future <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> {{and he came to}} describe it as the most important work of his career, even though expressing his views damaged his reputation. Shockley argued that a higher rate of reproduction among the less intelligent was having a dysgenic effect, and that a drop in average intelligence would ultimately lead to a decline in civilization. With regard to racial differences he used the following standard statement, e.g., on a debate with Afro-centrist Frances Welsing and on Firing Line with William F. Buckley Jr.:My research leads me inescapably to the opinion that the major cause of the American Negro's intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and racially genetic in origin and, thus, not remediable to a major degree by practical improvements in the environment.Shockley's published writings and lectures to scientific organizations on this topic were partly based on the writings of psychologist Cyril Burt and were funded by the Pioneer Fund. Shockley also proposed that individuals with IQs below 100 be paid to undergo voluntary sterilization.|$|E
40|$|In <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> immortality, <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> {{has over}} <b>the</b> millennia {{developed}} rites and rituals {{to help in}} <b>the</b> passing <b>of</b> life to honor {{the person who is}} dying or has died or in some way demonstrate their “courage” and perseverance as well as duty even in <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> almost certain death. <b>The</b> centuries-old traditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gathering <b>of</b> loved ones, <b>the</b> chanting <b>of</b> prayers, <b>the</b> ritual religious blessings are in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> being replaced by <b>the</b> “miracles” <b>of</b> modern medical technology...|$|R
50|$|Generative Anthropology {{originated}} with Professor Eric Gans of UCLA who developed his ideas {{in a series}} of books and articles beginning with <b>The</b> Origin <b>of</b> Language: A Formal Theory of Representation (1981), which builds on <b>the</b> ideas <b>of</b> René Girard, notably that of mimetic desire. However, in establishing <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> Generative Anthropology, Gans departs from and goes beyond Girard's work in many ways. Generative Anthropology is therefore an independent and original way <b>of</b> understanding <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species,</b> its origin, culture, history, and development.|$|R
50|$|From a {{scientific}} point <b>of</b> view, <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> {{is a single}} species. It is therefore misleading to use divisive terms such as races and racial groups. Nevertheless, the term racial group is enshrined in legislation, and phrases such as race equality and race relations are in widespread official use. Racial equity in education means <b>the</b> assignment <b>of</b> students to public schools and within schools without regard to their race. This includes providing students with a full opportunity for participation in all educational programs regardless of their race.|$|R

500|$|Chomsky's main {{argument}} in Hegemony or Survival {{is that the}} socio-economic elite who control the United States have pursued an [...] "Imperial Grand Strategy" [...] {{since the end of}} World War II in order to maintain global hegemony through military, political and economic means. He argues that in doing so they have repeatedly shown a total disregard for democracy and human rights, {{in stark contrast to the}} US government's professed support for those values. Furthermore, he argues that this continual pursuit of global hegemony now threatens the existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> itself because of the increasing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.|$|E
500|$|Antiscience and neo-Luddite {{conspiracy}} theorists emphasize technology forecasting in their New World Order conspiracy theories. They {{speculate that the}} global power elite are reactionary modernists pursuing a transhumanist agenda to develop and use human enhancement technologies {{in order to become}} a [...] "posthuman ruling caste", while change accelerates toward a technological singularity—a theorized future point of discontinuity when events will accelerate at such a pace that normal unenhanced humans will be unable to predict or even understand the rapid changes occurring in the world around them. Conspiracy theorists fear the outcome will either be the emergence of a Brave New World-like dystopia—a [...] "Brave New World Order"—or the extinction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
50|$|Homo antecessor is an extinct <b>human</b> <b>species</b> (or subspecies) {{dating from}} 1.2 million to 800,000 years ago, that was {{discovered}} by Eudald Carbonell, Juan Luis Arsuaga and J. M. Bermúdez de Castro."The unique mix of modern and primitive traits led the researchers to deem the fossils a new species, H. antecessor, in 1997". Regarding its great age the species must be related to Out <b>of</b> Africa I, <b>the</b> first series <b>of</b> hominin expansions into Eurasia, making it one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest-known <b>human</b> <b>species</b> in Europe.|$|R
60|$|As among these, so among {{primitive}} men, {{the weakest}} and stupidest {{went to the}} wall, while the toughest and shrewdest, those who were best fitted to cope with their circumstances, but not the best in any other sense, survived.

50|$|A {{location}} {{which combines}} an average temperature of 19 degrees Celsius, 60% average humidity and a temperature range of about 10 degrees Celsius around the average temperature (yearly temperature variation) is considered ideal in terms <b>of</b> comfort for <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species.</b> Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> places with these characteristics {{are located in}} the transition between temperate and tropical climates, approximately around the tropics, particularly in the Southern hemisphere (<b>the</b> tropic <b>of</b> Capricorn).|$|R
500|$|The {{mitochondrial}} genome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> of body lice (Pediculus humanus humanus), {{the head}} louse (Pediculus humanus capitis) and the pubic louse (Phthirus pubis) fragmented {{into a number}} of minichromosomes, at least seven million years ago. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA in human body and hair lice reveals that greater genetic diversity existed in African than in non-African lice. [...] Human lice can also shed light on human migratory patterns in pre-history. The dominating theory of anthropologists regarding human migration is the Out of Africa Hypothesis. Genetic diversity accumulates over time, and mutations occur at a relatively constant rate. Because there is more genetic diversity in African lice, the lice and their human hosts must have existed in Africa before anywhere else.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Glancey {{referred}} to Crawford as [...] "a compelling if decidedly cantankerous anti-hero" [...] and an [...] "essentially Victorian eccentric". Hauser characterised him as [...] "a very British {{combination of a}} snob and a rebel", also noting that he was [...] "no great intellectual". Similarly, Clark expressed the view that [...] "Crawford's achievements" [...] stemmed from his [...] "moral integrity and singleness of mind" [...] rather than [...] "any outstanding intellectual brilliance". The journalist Neal Ascherson described Crawford as [...] "not conventionally intellectual". Ascherson added that Crawford was [...] "withdrawn, generally ill at ease with other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> except on paper, and suspicious of personal celebrity", in this way contrasting Crawford with his [...] "gregarious" [...] contemporaries Wheeler and Daniel.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Hendrix {{told the}} {{journalist}} Keith Altham that [...] "Third Stone from the Sun" [...] {{is about a}} visiting space alien who, upon evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species,</b> decides {{that people are not}} fit to rule Earth, destroys their civilization, and places the planet in the care of chickens. The song is composed of two contrasting sections, one that features a jazzy guitar melody played in the style of Wes Montgomery over a straightforward rock tempo, and another that showcases Hendrix's free-form mixolydian mode guitar lines with a jazz beat. The track contains no proper vocals, instead using spoken words played at half-speed to invoke images of interstellar space travel. In addition to jazz elements, Unterberger identified Hendrix's use of surf music motifs in the track that are reminiscent of earlier works by the Ventures, a group from the Pacific Northwest that Hendrix would have heard during his childhood.|$|E
40|$|Universal Grammar (UG) {{is indeed}} {{evolutionarily}} implausible. But if languages are just “adapted” {{to a large}} primate brain, {{it is hard to}} see why other primates do not have complex languages.
