5|$|Ambondro was {{described}} {{on the basis of}} a fragmentary right mandible (lower jaw) with three teeth in it (Figure 1), interpreted as the last premolar (p-last) and the first two molars (m1 and m2). It is in the collection of the University of Antananarivo as specimen UA10602. Relative to other primitive mammals, it is small. Each of the teeth has a prominent cingulum (shelf) on the inner (lingual) side. The p-last has a strong central cusp. There is a cuspule (small cusp) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tooth and probably another on the inner front corner. This tooth resembles the molars of symmetrodonts, a group of primitive mammals, but the back cusp is smaller than the metaconid of symmetrodonts.|$|E

5|$|Eckfeldt also {{produced}} a pattern disme, of which {{only a few}} were struck. When the Mint's first cents (produced in 1793) {{were found to be}} excessively crude and attracted public ridicule, Eckfeldt was called upon to design replacements. He placed a wreath <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cent instead of the original chain, and placed a trefoil under Liberty's head on the obverse. He also engraved the first half cent dies later the same year.|$|E
5|$|Magpies {{prefer to}} swoop {{at the back}} of the head; therefore, keeping the magpie in sight at all times can {{discourage}} the bird. A basic disguise such as sunglasses worn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head may fool the magpie as to where a person is looking. Eyes painted on hats or helmets will deter attacks on pedestrians but not cyclists.|$|E

5|$|P. c. capitalis {{is found}} in the {{southern}} Rocky Mountains from eastern Idaho, south-central Montana, and western and southern Wyoming south through eastern Utah, and western and central Colorado, to east-central Arizona and north-central New Mexico.

Parathyroid hormone and calcitonin (one of the hormones made by the thyroid gland) have key roles in regulating the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones.|$|E

The stela also names Chak Tok Ich'aak I's father as K'inich Muwaan Jol.|$|E
5|$|The club colours {{have not}} always been sky blue. The {{predecessor}} club BK Idrott wore blue and white striped shirts and white shorts, and this kit was still used {{for the first six months}} of 1910 after Malmö FF was founded. This was later changed to red and white striped shirts and black shorts to show that Malmö FF was a new, independent club. This colour combination has on occasion been used in modern times as the away kit. The present sky-blue kit was introduced in 1920. Since 2010 a small Scanian flag is featured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shirt just below the neck.|$|E
