5|$|Practical nurse Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram) {{leaves to}} fly to New Jersey to visit her aunt. Her client and detective Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is forced to go with her, as he fears {{not being able to}} live without Sharona. While at San Francisco International Airport, a woman named Barbara Chabrol (Jennifer Dale) stands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> to kiss her husband Stefan (Carl Marotte).|$|E
25|$|Nut is {{also the}} barrier {{separating}} the forces of chaos from the ordered cosmos in the world. She was pictured as a woman arched <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> and fingertips over the earth; her body portrayed as a star-filled sky. Nut's fingers and toes were believed to touch the four cardinal points or directions of north, south, east, and west.|$|E
500|$|This was {{the final}} episode of the season to be filmed, though not the last to air. According to Jenna Fischer, {{everybody}} on the set was excited {{in a manner that}} she likened to students {{on the last day of}} school. The giddiness particularly shows in Fischer's performance: Pam skips after Jim into the break room, she bounces <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> at the end of the [...] "fake crying" [...] talking head, and she taps the soda can three times to get Jim to release the jinx.|$|E
5000|$|Later reprints of {{the book}} change from Carlotta {{slapping}} Mirabel for ruining a Drama class to <b>her</b> stepping <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toe.</b>|$|R
25|$|A woman {{recovering}} from knee surgery suffered a persistent {{infection of the}} knee with Pasteurella after her dog licked a small wound <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toe.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rock-Olga {{developed}} a fever after performing at Gröna Lund on 8 May 2010, and was subsequently diagnosed with blood poisoning from a cut <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toe.</b> She died from complications on 10June 2010.|$|R
500|$|Aboard the plane, an {{annoying}} extension cord salesman named Warren Beach (Garry Marshall) {{does little to}} assuage Monk's fears. Monk quickly becomes suspicious of Stefan Chabrol after he notices that Barbara no longer needs to stand <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> to kiss him, has [...] "forgotten" [...] that she ordered the vegetarian meal, knows nothing about air travel despite a frequent-flyer lapel, and claims to have [...] "forgotten how to" [...] speak French when an old family friend, Bernard, meets them on board. More digging convinces Monk he is on to something. Monk quickly annoys everyone and a fellow passenger informs Stefan of Monk's suspicions.|$|E
60|$|She {{knows that}} it must be now or never. She has left her biggest guns for the end. In her {{excitement}} she is rising up and down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Tottie {{promised to}} be careful in this respect, and {{expressed}} a belief that she was too light to hurt Mrs Square, {{even if she did}} tread <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> accidentally.|$|E
60|$|She now {{searched the}} Wizard's {{cupboard}} {{until she found}} <b>her</b> <b>toe,</b> which had been safely hidden in a little ivory box. Truella stopped {{only long enough to}} put <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toe,</b> and then she ran through the caves and up the stairways until she {{reached the top of the}} mountain again.|$|R
6000|$|While {{the maid}} served dinner, there could scarce {{have been a}} more {{severely}} correct pair, though Carl did step <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toe</b> when she was saying to the maid, in her best offhand manner, [...] "Oh, Leah, will you please tell Mrs. Needham that I stole a handkerchief from my--I mean from her room?" ...|$|R

6000|$|So {{they began}} solemnly dancing {{round and round}} Alice, {{every now and then}} {{treading}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> when they came too close, and waving their fore-paws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang, slowly and sadly, these words: ...|$|E
6000|$|A flame indeed had {{leaped up}} in Gyp. This fluffy, flabby talk of love set her {{instincts}} in revolt. She {{did not want}} to love; she had failed to fall in love. But, whatever love was like, it did not bear talking about. How was it that this little suburban girl, when she once got <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes,</b> could twirl one's emotions as she did? ...|$|E
50|$|Meier {{competed in}} few events in her final three seasons {{due to a}} string of injuries. She missed much of 2008-09 due to spinal disc {{herniation}} and muscle problems, although {{she was able to}} compete at the 2009 World Championships and earned an Olympic spot for Switzerland with her ninth place showing. In 2009-10, Meier struggled with an Achilles tendon inflammation. She withdrew from the 2009 NHK Trophy because she was unable to put too much pressure <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toe</b> pick. She finished 15th at the Olympics and failing to qualify for the free skate at the 2010 Worlds after a bad fall in the short program.|$|R
50|$|While {{the outer}} figures create an {{approximate}} visual symmetry {{from the waist}} up, their legs are different. The figure on the proper right stands similarly to the central figure, while the proper left figure balances <b>on</b> <b>her</b> right <b>toes</b> and extends <b>her</b> left leg behind her and to the left.|$|R
5000|$|... 18. Leslie: Leslie can't {{figure out}} what to do with <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> since she thinks they're useless. She tries to sell them to Louis for 5¢ each (a total of 50¢), but then he lowers the offer price <b>on</b> <b>her</b> three {{smallest}} <b>toes</b> (<b>on</b> each foot) to 3¢ each (a total of 38¢). When Leslie won't sell the small toes at that price, Louis offers her 10¢ total for the two big ones; she refuses to sell <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> unless as a complete set, thus losing the deal.|$|R
60|$|Ah, SHE {{had loved}} him--little Daphne! It was past three. Going in, {{he took his}} place in the stalls, close to the stage, and stared before him, with a sort of bitter amusement. This was irony indeed! Ah--and here she came! A Pierrette--in short, diaphanous muslin, her face whitened to match it; a Pierrette who stood slowly {{spinning}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes,</b> with arms raised and hands joined in an arch above her glistening hair.|$|E
60|$|Trent's {{appearance}} {{upon the}} lawn {{was greeted with}} a shout of enthusiasm. The young lady in blue executed a pas seut, and came across to him <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes,</b> and {{the girl with the}} yellow hair, although sulky, gave him to understand by a sidelong glance that her favour was not permanently withdrawn. They neither of the noticed the somewhat ominous air of civility with which he received their greetings, or the contempt in his eyes as he looked them silently over.|$|E
60|$|We three set off, {{the gossip}} leaning <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes,</b> {{tripping}} between us. She was much gratified by Lettie's {{information concerning the}} proposals for the new home. We left her in a glow of congratulatory smiles on the highway. But the clouds had upreared, and stretched in two great arms, reaching overhead. The little spinster hurried along, but the black hands of the clouds kept pace and clutched her. A sudden gust of wind shuddered in the trees, and rushed upon her cloak, blowing its bugles.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in the 1990s shoes tips {{were made}} using resin or {{fiberglass}} {{to reduce the}} weight and enhance {{the sound of the}} footwork. Hard shoes are made of black leather with flexible soles. Sometimes the front taps are filed flat to enable the dancer to stand <b>on</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>toes,</b> somewhat like pointe shoes.|$|R
50|$|A {{hybrid of}} human and feline, Catspaw has the agility, speed, and {{heightened}} senses (smelling, hearing, and balance) of a cat, as well as retractable claws <b>on</b> <b>her</b> fingertips and <b>toes.</b> She has excellent night-vision and animal-like instincts.|$|R
5000|$|Importantly, {{it should}} also be noted that this shoe design may cause harm to the athlete if worn for {{extended}} periods of time outside of competition. Injury may occur when walking in a leisurely fashion, as the athlete is not <b>on</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>toes,</b> which is the manner in which the shoes were meant to be worn.|$|R
6000|$|A small, dark man, dapper and debonair, swallow-tailed and top-hatted, was waltzing {{about the}} stage with dainty, mincing steps, and in a thin little voice singing {{something}} or other about somebody or something evidently pathetic. As his waning voice neared {{the end of the}} lines, a large woman, crowned with an amazing wealth of blond hair, thrust rudely past Edna, trod heavily <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes,</b> and shoved her contemptuously to the side. [...] "Bloomin' hamateur!" [...] she hissed as she went past, and the next instant she was on the stage, graciously bowing to the audience, while the small, dark man twirled extravagantly about on his tiptoes.|$|E
6000|$|Sylvia {{received}} her lovely plaything with enthusiasm, and Tilly felt herself suddenly transported to a baby's Paradise, where beds were unknown and fruit and freedom were her welcome portion. Merrily popped the corn, nimbly danced the nuts upon the shovel, lustily remonstrated the rosy martyrs on the hearth, and cheerfully the minutes slipped away. Sylvia sung every jubilant air she knew, Moor whistled astonishing accompaniments, and Tilly danced over the carpet with nut-shells <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes,</b> {{and tried to}} fill her little gown with [...] "pitty flowers" [...] from its garlands and bouquets. Without the wind lamented, the sky wept, and the sea thundered on the shore; but within, youth, innocence, and love held their blithe revel undisturbed.|$|E
60|$|What was it {{that made}} her start back, and gaze upon him for a moment, {{and then on the}} ground at her feet, and make as if she would faint on his arm, had he not by opportunely {{treading}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes,</b> brought the young lady back to self-control? Why was she so violently agitated at Dobbin's request? This can never be known. But when he came the next day, Maria was not in the drawing-room with her sister, and Miss Wirt went off for the purpose of fetching the latter, and the Captain and Miss Osborne were left together. They were both so silent that the ticktock of the Sacrifice of Iphigenia clock on the mantelpiece became quite rudely audible.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Toe Jam" [...] {{is another}} improvised cut, {{recorded}} {{the same day}} as [...] "Dreams Are Free, Motherfucker", only with another band friend, Dirk Vandenburg (who would also do photography on several Minutemen covers, including Double Nickels...) playing drums, while drummer George Hurley attempted to play Cranes trumpet, Crane did some scat-singing, and another friend ad-libbed a poem about wanting to wear a wedding ring <b>on</b> <b>her</b> second <b>toe</b> (hence the name of the song).|$|R
50|$|Plantigrade foot occurs {{normally}} in humans in static postures of standing and sitting. It should also occur {{normally in}} gait (walking). Hypertonicity, spasticity, clonus, {{limited range of}} motion, abnormal flexion neural pattern, and a plantarflexor (calf) muscle contracture may contribute to an individual only standing and/or walking <b>on</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>toes.</b> This would be evident by the observable heel rise.|$|R
25|$|The {{birth of}} the modern pointe shoe is often {{attributed}} to the early 20th-century Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, {{who was one of}} the most famous and influential dancers of her time. Pavlova had particularly high, arched insteps, which left her vulnerable to injury when dancing en pointe. She also had slender, tapered feet, which resulted in excessive pressure <b>on</b> <b>her</b> big <b>toes.</b> To compensate for this, she inserted toughened leather soles into her shoes for extra support and flattened and hardened the toe area to form a box.|$|R
6000|$|There {{were some}} really {{beautiful}} dresses of rich old brocade, and some gleaming old shawls, a shimmer of lavender and silver, or of dark, rich shot colours with deep borders of white silver and primrose gold, very lovely. I believe {{two of them}} were actual women--but the q-b says no. There was a Victorian gown of thick green silk, with a creamy blotched cross-over shawl. About her we both were doubtful. There were two wistful, drooping-lily sisters, all in white, with big feet. And there was a very successful tall miss in a narrow hobble-skirt of black satin and a toque with ospreys. The way she minced and wagged her posterior and went <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> and peered over her shoulder and kept her elbows in was an admirable caricature. Especially the curious sagging heaving movement of [...] "bustle" [...] region, a movement very characteristic of modern feminism, was hit off with a bit of male exaggeration which rejoiced me. At first she even took me in.|$|E
60|$|Heyst, with a {{movement}} of retreat, let the curtain drop slowly. On the instant she stooped for the slipper, and, with it in her hand, spun round wildly, looking for some hiding-place; {{but there was no}} such spot in the bare room. The chest, the leather bunk, a dress or two of hers hanging on pegs--there was no place where the merest hazard might not guide Heyst's hand at any moment. Her wildly roaming eyes were caught by the half-closed window. She ran to it, and by raising herself <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> was able to reach the shutter with her fingertips. She pushed it square, stole back {{to the middle of the}} room, and, turning about, swung her arm, regulating the force of the throw so as not to let the slipper fly too far out and hit the edge of the overhanging eaves. It was a task of the nicest judgement for the muscles of those round arms, still quivering from the deadly wrestle with a man, for that brain, tense with the excitement of the situation and for the unstrung nerves flickering darkness before her eyes. At last the slipper left her hand. As soon as it passed the opening, it was out of her sight. She listened. She did not hear it strike anything; it just vanished, as if it had wings to fly on through the air. Not a sound! It had gone clear.|$|E
60|$|In {{the region}} of Scandal Point--felicitous name--where there are handy rocks to sit on and a noble view of the sea on the one hand, {{and on the other}} the passing and repassing whirl and tumult of gay carriages, are great groups of comfortably-off Parsee women--perfect flower-beds of {{brilliant}} color, a fascinating spectacle. Tramp, tramp, tramping along the road, in singles, couples, groups, and gangs, you have the working-man and the working-woman--but not clothed like ours. Usually the man is a nobly-built great athlete, with not a rag on but his loin-handkerchief; his color a deep dark brown, his skin satin, his rounded muscles knobbing it as if it had eggs under it. Usually the woman is a slender and shapely creature, as erect as a lightning-rod, and she has but one thing on--a bright-colored piece of stuff which is wound about her head and her body down nearly half-way to her knees, and which clings like her own skin. Her legs and feet are bare, and so are her arms, except for her fanciful bunches of loose silver rings on her ankles and on her arms. She has jewelry bunched on the side of her nose also, and showy clusterings <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toes.</b> When she undresses for bed she takes off her jewelry, I suppose. If she took off anything more she would catch cold. As a rule she has a large shiney brass water jar of graceful shape on her head, and one of her naked arms curves up and the hand holds it there. She is so straight, so erect, and she steps with such style, and such easy grace and dignity; and her curved arm and her brazen jar are such a help to the picture--indeed, our working-women cannot begin with her as a road-decoration.|$|E
50|$|In the 2008-09 season, Zhang {{competed for}} the second {{consecutive}} season on the Grand Prix. At her first event, the 2008 Skate Canada International, she placed third in the short program with a score of 53.28 after falling <b>on</b> <b>her</b> opening jump combination. She placed 5th in the free skate with a score of 97.52, after falling on one jump and omitting another, to place 5th overall. At the 2008 Trophée Eric Bompard, her second Grand Prix assignment, Zhang placed third in the short program with a score of 51.76 after omitting the required double axel as well as receiving a Level 1 <b>on</b> <b>her</b> spiral sequence. Zhang scored 104.78 in the long program after receiving a downgrade <b>on</b> <b>her</b> triple flip-triple <b>toe</b> combination, as well as a deduction for a wrong edge take-off <b>on</b> <b>her</b> triple lutz-double <b>toe.</b> She earned a Level 4 on all three of her spins and her spiral sequence. She scored 156.54 overall and won the bronze medal.|$|R
60|$|In turn, {{at night}} <b>on</b> deck, wriggling <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> at him under a rug to {{simulate}} some strange and crawling creature of an invader, he would dare to simulate his own befoolment and quite disrupt Villa's {{bed with his}} frantic ferocious attack on the thing that he knew was only <b>her</b> <b>toes.</b> In gales of laughter, intermingled with half-genuine cries of alarm as almost his teeth caught <b>her</b> <b>toes,</b> she always concluded by gathering him into her arms and laughing {{the last of her}} laughter away into his flattened ears of joy and love. Who else, of all on board the Ariel, would have dared such devilishness with the lady-god's bed? This question it never entered his mind to ask himself; yet he was fully aware of how exclusively favoured he was.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a toddler}} she had weak ankles and would fall {{over with the}} {{slightest}} misstep, so her mother decided to enroll her in ballet class at the Washington School of Ballet {{at the age of}} three. This was the beginning of her interest in performing. Strongly motivated by ballet, she never missed a class. In classical romantic pieces like Romeo and Juliet and The Sleeping Beauty, she always played the boys' roles due to being the tallest in the group and the absence of males in the class. Eventually she had a substantial female role as the fairy godmother in Cinderella; while warming up backstage, she broke her ankle, but then tightened the ribbons <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>toe</b> shoes and proceeded to dance the role all the way through before calling for an ambulance. Ultimately she decided against making a career of professional ballet because she had grown too tall and was unable to acquire perfect technique. She explained that she didn't have the ideal body type, lacking the requisite [...] "beautifully constructed feet" [...] of high arches, high insteps and a flexible ankle. Also slowly realizing ballet's propensity to be too all-consuming, and ultimately limiting, she moved on to other forms of dancing, acting and musical theater.|$|R
