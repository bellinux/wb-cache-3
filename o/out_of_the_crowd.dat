5|$|Henry {{was born}} in Silsbee, Texas. As a child, {{he was a big}} wrestling fan and André the Giant was his {{favorite}} wrestler. While attending a wrestling show in Beaumont, Texas, young Henry tried to touch André as he was walking down the aisle, but tripped over the barricade. André picked him up <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> and put him back behind the barricade. When Henry was 12 years old, his father, Ernest, died of complications from diabetes. When he was 14 years old, Henry was diagnosed with dyslexia.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Sabu {{teamed with}} Insane Clown Posse to defeat Trent Acid and the Young Alter Boys at Juggalo Championship Wrestling's Bloodymania. During {{the second season}} of the company's {{internet}} wrestling show SlamTV!, Raven {{was involved in a}} feud with JCW Heavyweight Champion Corporal Robinson. In the third episode, Sabu appeared from <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> and saved Robinson from an attack by Raven and his lackey Sexy Slim Goody. Raven and Goody teamed up against Robinson and Sabu in the following episode, but Raven fled from the match. At Bloodymania III, Sabu defeated Raven in a Raven's Rules match.|$|E
25|$|The Opening Ceremony {{culminated in}} the end of the torch relay, a {{tradition}} begun when Berlin hosted the games in 1936. Before the torch came into the stadium, a three rings arose {{from the center of the}} stadium that simulated a globe. This segment preceding the torch's arrival honored the first global torch relay that was begun by Athens 2004. Actors, suspended on cables, started rising <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> and ran towards the globe, carrying glowing sticks meant to simulate the Olympic torch. On the globe, the names of the cities which the torch visited were projected, and this segment ended with all the torchbearers floating mid-air coming together at the globe. After this segment ended, the lights were dimmed, and the sound of the heartbeat accompanied by thunderous cheers and applause met the torch's final arrival to the Olympic Stadium.|$|E

25|$|Jet's Nic Cester ran energetically {{around the}} Green Room whilst Sam Endicott of The Bravery also {{launched}} {{himself into the}} Green Room crowd {{at the end of}} the band's set. Enter Shikari singer Rou Reynolds joined fans in the front few rows, throwing himself into the crowd several times during their Green Room set, whilst the band also bounced on a trampoline on stage. On the Pet Sounds Stage, having managed to drown out Biffy Clyro who were on the NME Stage at the same time, David Kitt had stewards pull his younger brother <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> and up onto the stage so they could perform a song together. Editors, playing in the Green Room on the Saturday night, and The Blizzards, playing on the Main Stage on the Sunday afternoon, both made their third consecutive appearance at Oxegen.|$|E
25|$|Morrison's first title {{defense was}} {{scheduled}} against Mike Williams, but when Williams withdrew {{on the night}} of the fight, Tim Tomashek stood in as a replacement. Although Tomashek had been prepared to fight as a backup plan, some news reports created the impression that he had just been pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> The WBO later rescinded their sanctioning of this fight due to Tomashek's lack of experience. Almost immediately, talks of a fight with WBC champion Lennox Lewis began, but were halted when virtually unknown Michael Bentt upset Morrison in his next bout. Bentt knocked Morrison down three times, and the fight was stopped in the first round in front of a live HBO Boxing audience. Morrison recovered by winning three bouts in a row in 1994, but his last fight of the year, against Ross Puritty, ended with a draw.|$|E
25|$|Tracy has a {{daughter}} of her own, Naomi Clark, who dates jock Ethan Ward, brief rival of Dixon, whom she soon breaks up with. Annie and Ethan then pursue a relationship after having dated the summer prior to Annie moving to Beverly Hills, when Annie was visiting her grandmother for the summer. Both girls alternate between being friends, enemies, in a love triangle, and almost sisters, due to their parents' child. Their respective mothers {{find themselves in a}} love triangle of their own after Tracy's marriage to Charles Clark implodes (which Naomi takes quite badly) and she appears to want Harry back. Naomi's fight with Annie forces her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> after she starts her many plots of manipulation and revenge when she uses Annie's ex-boyfriend from Kansas, Jason, as a weapon to get back at her for hiding her relationship with Ethan. She becomes friends with a group of older girls and starts flirting with Ozzie, a rather alternative student, and later becomes attracted to a bartender named Liam, whom she soon finds out is actually her age and becomes a student at West Beverly High. Meanwhile, Ethan and Annie's relationship hits the rocks as he begins to rethink his life after a car accident and gets more or less attracted to Rhonda, the girl he hit. Soon Naomi and Liam begin a romance, and once she becomes friends with Annie again, Liam's repetitive indecisiveness begins as he starts to pursue the both of them.|$|E

500|$|Bowie {{entered the}} show to the song [...] "Glass Spider", {{for which he was}} lowered from the set's ceiling while seated in a silver chair and singing into a telephone. Bowie was dressed in a single-breasted three-quarters length red suit, a red shirt, and red shoes. The show's first {{vignette}} began with [...] "Bang Bang", during which Bowie pulled an audience member <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> only to be rejected by the fan, who {{by the end of the}} song was revealed to be one of the troupe's dancers. Later in the show, for the song [...] "Fashion", the dance troupe threatened Bowie with a street fight, which, by the end of the song, he accidentally wins. For the live rendition of [...] "Never Let Me Down", the performance of which Bowie called [...] "abrasive", he was influenced by the minimalist choreography of Pina Bausch. He said: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} scored by series {{composer}} Mark Snow, and was, according to him, his best episode {{score of the}} fifth season. He described the main theme as [...] "a very dark, macabre, insidious sort of nasty waltz". The episode's main theme is also greatly inspired by The Elephant Mans theme song by John Morris. Three songs are heard in the versions sung by Cher during the episode: [...] "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore", [...] "Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves" [...] and [...] "Walking in Memphis". The latter is played {{at the end of}} the episode when the agents take The Great Mutato to a Cher concert. In the episode, the character watches Cher's 1985 movie Mask, and derives comfort from the loving relationship between Cher's character and her son, who has a disfiguring genetic bone disorder. At the end of the episode, Mulder and Scully take The Great Mutato from his small town to a Cher concert, where she picks him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> to dance.|$|E
500|$|On the April 11, 2008 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, {{she made her}} main roster debut as a villain, {{introducing}} herself {{as the daughter of}} Jim Neidhart under the name Natalya Neidhart, accompanying Victoria to her match against Michelle McCool. In the April 4, episode of SmackDown! she came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> to aid Victoria in an attack against McCool and Cherry, forming an alliance with her in the process. Three weeks later on SmackDown! she made her televised in-ring debut, under the shortened ring name Natalya, defeating Cherry with her uncle's submission move the [...] "sharpshooter". On the June 6 episode of SmackDown!, SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero announced the creation of the Divas Championship, and that same night the Divas competed in a Golden Dreams match to qualify for the championship match at The Great American Bash. Natalya won, but lost the match to Michelle McCool. At the Backlash pay–per–view on April 27 Natalya teamed up with Victoria, Beth Phoenix, Jillian Hall, Layla and Melina to defeat Mickie James, Maria Kanellis, Ashley, Michelle McCool, Cherry and Kelly Kelly in a 12-Diva tag team match. On the May 2 episode of SmackDown!, Victoria and Natalya defeated McCool and Cherry.|$|E
60|$|The cowboy {{stepped down}} slowly, guardedly, {{but he kept}} on. Allie saw men run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> dance-hall into <b>the</b> open space behind Stanton.

60|$|Her {{eyes seemed}} to pass through him, to look <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> room, as though indeed they had {{found their way into}} some corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world where the things which make life lie. It was a lapse from which she {{recovered}} almost immediately, but when she looked at him, and with a little farewell nod withdrew her hand, the transforming gleam had passed away.|$|R
50|$|Little {{entered the}} race for the Republican {{nomination}} to challenge incumbent Democratic Governor Mike Easley in 2004. He had <b>the</b> support <b>of</b> both former governors Holshouser and Martin. <b>The</b> only one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a field of six challengers who had not ever held elected office, Little's largely self-financed campaign earned him four percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> popular vote but left him in last place <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> primary field.|$|R

2500|$|Her first {{contribution}} in music came after she met William Orbit {{at a party}} and tried to beg a cigarette from him. They began a relationship shortly after, and he encouraged her to do some spoken word for his Strange Cargo project and to sing. Possibly the best-known work from that time is [...] "Water from a Vine Leaf", which she co-wrote and which was released as a limited-edition single. It was also {{at this time that}} Orbit and Orton covered John Martyn's [...] "Don't Wanna Know 'Bout Evil", which was not only the first song that they recorded together, but also their first release in Japan, as a duet called Spill (later re-released in the UK in 1997). She regarded Orbit's influence as very positive, commenting [...] "I think William pulled me <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> and pulled me out of the gutter, in a way. Because I don't know where my enthusiasm was going to take me, because it was pretty raw to say the least." ...|$|E
2500|$|The tour's {{rendition}} of [...] "Rope Burn" [...] was considered [...] "incredibly sexy" [...] and [...] "what everyone was talking about", becoming its most controversial performance. During the act, Jackson [...] "plucks a male fan <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> and ties {{his hands to}} {{the arms of a}} chair on stage while she gyrates around him and eventually kisses him." [...] The selected fan was required to be strapped into the chair due to safety concerns from Jackson's previous tour, after the participant had forcefully grabbed and fondled her while onstage. Jackson said, [...] "Everyone thinks it's this kinky thing. But the reason he gets strapped in is on this last tour, this guy grabbed my crotch. I sat on his lap and then I stood up and he grabbed my crotch, and I was trying to move his hand and he was too strong for me and he was just rubbing on my crotch. There was nothing I could do, so I said to myself I would never let that happen again." [...] Jackson's performance of [...] "What About" [...] is also infamous for its portrayal of domestic violence and abuse. The tour's [...] "racy" [...] costumes were designed by fashion designer David Cardona, who commented [...] "All her life it's been about Janet being cute. Now it's about Janet being sexy." ...|$|E
50|$|In one British form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tactic, {{three or}} four {{officers}} rush {{at a group of}} violent or disorderly people, with two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> officers carrying batons and the others a shield. The officer with the shield rushes the most violent in the group and forces the subject between the shield and a fixed object, while the other officers either arrest the others or escort them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] said I, though I was not. [...] "It was <b>the</b> impulse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment." [...] I {{felt sick}} with {{exertion}} and excitement. Turning, I pushed my way <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowding</b> Beast People {{and went on}} alone up the slope towards <b>the</b> higher part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> headland. Under <b>the</b> shouted directions <b>of</b> Moreau I heard the three white-swathed Bull-men begin dragging the victim down towards the water.|$|R

As soon as Bateman was alone in his room he asked for a number on the telephone. His heart leaped when he heard the voice that answered him.|$|R
2500|$|The 1970 National Christmas Tree {{suffered}} several near-disasters. The [...] {{tall blue}} spruce from South Dakota's Black Hills was carried to Washington, D.C., on a train. [...] The train derailed twice {{on its way}} to the city. The weekend before the tree lighting ceremony, the tree blew over in high winds and several cut branches had to be attached to the tree to replace damaged ones. A few days after the tree was lit, lightbulbs on the lower half of the tree began exploding after a fireproofing liquid applied to the sockets began causing shorts in the strings of lights. No anti-war protests occurred during the tree lighting ceremony in 1970, however. Women Strike for Peace temporarily won a court order permitting them to set up an anti-Vietnam War display of 11 lighted styrofoam tombstones listing the number of American war dead near the pageant, but this ruling was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit two days later on December 18. (The anti-war display was set up on the Washington Monument grounds instead.) The 1970 tree was lit by President Richard Nixon and Andre Proctor, a local District of Columbia child whom President Nixon picked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> at the last moment to assist him with the tree-lighting. The 1970 Pageant of Peace also included a tree dedicated to prisoners of war and soldiers missing in action.|$|E

50|$|Other {{bungalows}} and plantations also {{grew up in}} Mazagaon as the British and {{the more}} affluent Indians moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> fort. When <b>the</b> Esplanade was cleared in the Fort area, the armoury moved from Bombay Castle to Mazagaon in 1760 and gave its name to Gunpowder Lane. In 1790 the docks at Mazagaon were completed. In 1793, after <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hornby Vellard, the Bellasis Road was built to join Mazagaon and Malabar Hill.|$|R
5000|$|Suburban {{development}} in Auckland depended on <b>the</b> availability <b>of</b> land, affordable transport, and desire <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle class to move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> inner city. Auckland experienced significant growth in population between 1874 and 1886, {{putting pressure on}} the areas closest to the city. The population growth combined with public transportation extending outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present city centre in the early 1880s created prime conditions for landowners to subdivide their properties for residential use. [...] Eden Valley's commercial hub began to develop in the 1880s, {{but it was not}} until the early 1900s that the development really took off.|$|R

50|$|Until the 1960s, Roebourne was a {{non-indigenous}} town {{operating as}} a regional administrative centre, with strict controls and curfews placed on movement of Aboriginal people to, from and within the town. Most Aboriginals were confined to camps and reserves a few kilometres away. However, as mining companies seeking to exploit the iron ore in the region constructed other company towns such as Dampier and Wickham for their workers, and as pastoralism declined, and with changing attitudes to Aboriginal welfare at governmental level in the late 1960s, Roebourne became a majority Aboriginal town as people moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> camps and reserves, and from the outlying stations.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} looked at him impudently. But the clear, stern eyes of Matt's partner made him wilt, and muttering {{something}} under his breath about getting square, he paid over the amount, took the knife, and sneaked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> now <b>crowded</b> store.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 bus lanes {{were added}} to several pairs of {{parallel}} streets traversing the downtown area. Bus stops along these are spaced every three blocks instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> usual two. For {{the most part they}} leave room to only one additional, narrow lane on the left for cars and other vehicles. They can be used for taxis carrying passengers as well. They are exclusive for public transport during weekdays and on Saturday morning; stopping or parking on the affected streets is forbidden, as well as right turns. Their implementation attracted opposition from residents and shop owners but was well received by habitual bus users, since they reduce the time needed to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> central area by a noticeable amount.|$|R
