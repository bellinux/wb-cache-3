25|$|It {{has been}} found that {{bevirimat}} does not inhibit the cytochrome P450 system or interact with the human P-glycoprotein. Unformulated bevirimat is not well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood. Some of the less desirable properties of unformulated bevirimat and its salts include: inadequate bioavailability, poor solubility of the pharmaceutical composition in gastric fluid, insufficient dispersion of bevirimat in gastric fluid, below standard long term safety profile for oral dosage forms, below standard long term chemical and physical stability of the final dosage form, tendency for conversion to metastable forms, lengthy dissolution times for oral dosage forms, and precipitation in gastric or intestinal fluids. Some pharmaceutical compositions of formulated bevirimat have shown to have better properties over unformulated bevirimat. Some of these properties include: improved bioavailability, improved solubility of the composition in gastric fluid, improved dispersion of bevirimat in gastric fluid, improved safety for oral dosage forms, improved chemical and physical stability of the oral dosage form, decreased conversion to metastable forms, and decreased rate of precipitation in gastric fluid. Bevirimat was rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with detectable concentrations present in the plasma within 15 minutes after administration and peak plasma concentrations were achieved approximately one to three hours after administration. The plasma had a mean plasma elimination half-life ranging from 58 to 80 hours. This long half-life of bevirimat supports <b>once-daily</b> <b>dosing.</b> Elimination of bevirimat is primarily via hepatobiliary routes, with renal elimination counting for less than 1% of the dose.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{improve the}} dosing {{frequency}} and pill burden of antiretroviral therapy, we compared two <b>once-daily</b> <b>dosed</b> regimens to a twice-daily dosed regimen. METHOD: HIV- 1 -infected, antiretroviral drug-naive adults were randomized to either twice-daily nelfinavir and stavudine and once-daily didanosine (regimen A) or simplified <b>once-daily</b> <b>dosed</b> antiretroviral regimens consisting of nevirapine, didanosine, and lamivudine (regimen B) or saquinavir, ritonavir, didanosine, and lamivudine (regimen C). RESULTS: At 48 weeks of therapy, {{the proportion of}} patients with a blood plasma HIV- 1 RNA concentration (pVL) < 50 copies/mL by intention-to treat analysis was 42. 3 %, 50. 0 %, and 56. 5 % for regimens A (n = 26), B (n = 22), and C (n = 23), respectively. The time to a pVL < 50 copies/mL {{for the first time}} was significantly shorter in regimen C, and there was significantly more progression to CDC events in regimen B. These differences are possibly due to differences in baseline characteristics. Adverse events were lowest for regimen C; more signs associated with mitochondrial toxicity occurred in regimen A. Increase in CD 4 count was comparable between arms. CONCLUSION: No statistically significant difference in efficacy was found between the two investigated <b>once-daily</b> <b>dosed</b> treatment regimens (B and C) and the reference (A).

Efficacy was evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Revised Symptom Checklist and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. A successful response to treatment was achieved in 91 % (10 / 11) of patients who received trazodone and 57 % (four of seven) of patients who were administered clorazepate (P = 0. 1373). Bayesian analysis revealed that the prior probability of making a wrong decision in prescribing trazodone rather than clorazepate reduced from 26 % to 8 %. Assessment of the clinical scales suggested a benefit of trazodone compared with clorazepate, although the differences were not significant. Safety of both treatments was similar.

In this study, we evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of combining <b>once-daily</b> <b>doses</b> of the soft-gel capsule (SGC) formulation of saquinavir (saquinavir-SGC) and minidose ritonavir. Forty-four healthy HIV-negative volunteers were randomized into groups receiving <b>once-daily</b> <b>doses</b> of saquinavir-SGC (1, 200 to 1, 800 mg) plus ritonavir (100 to 200 mg) or a control group receiving only saquinavir-SGC (1, 200 mg) three times daily. Saquinavir-SGC alone and saquinavir-SGC–ritonavir combinations were generally well tolerated, {{and there were no}} safety concerns. Addition of ritonavir (100 mg) to saquinavir-SGC (1, 200 to 1, 800 mg/day) increased the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for saquinavir severalfold, and the intersubject peak concentration in plasma and AUC variability were reduced compared to those achieved with saquinavir-SGC alone (3, 600 mg/day), while trough saquinavir levels (24 h post-dose) were substantially higher than the 90 % inhibitory concentration calculated from HIV- 1 clinical isolates. Neither increasing the saquinavir-SGC dose to higher than 1, 600 mg nor increasing ritonavir from 100 to 200 mg appeared to further enhance the AUC. These results suggest that an all once-daily HAART regimen, utilizing saquinavir-SGC plus a more tolerable low dose of ritonavir, may be feasible.

50|$|Antibiotics in the {{aminoglycoside}} class, such as gentamicin and tobramycin, {{may produce}} cochleotoxicity through a poorly understood mechanism.

The anti-bacterial activity of aminoglycoside compounds is due to inhibition of ribosome function and these compounds similarly inhibit protein synthesis by mitochondrial ribosomes because mitochondria evolved from a bacterial ancestor. Consequently, aminoglycoside effects on production of reactive oxygen species as well as dysregulation of cellular calcium ion homeostasis may result from disruption of mitochondrial function. Ototoxicity of gentamicin can be exploited to treat some individuals with Ménière's disease by destroying the inner ear, which stops the vertigo attacks but causes permanent deafness.Due to the effects on mitochondria, certain inherited mitochondrial disorders result in increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of aminoglycosides.|$|E

DESIGN [...] An open, multicenter, noncomparative study with a follow-up of patients for 4 months to 5 years. SETTING [...] Internal medicine wards and outpatient clinics of hospitals of various sizes in three European countries. PATIENTS [...] Fifty-nine patients with defined criteria for streptococcal endocarditis. INTERVENTION [...] Ceftriaxone sodium administered at a <b>once-daily</b> <b>dose</b> of 2 g for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Clinical outcome and microbiological cure rate. RESULTS [...] Among the 59 patients, 55 completed the treatment and were followed up for 4 months to 5 years. No patients showed evidence of relapse. Treatment was completely uneventful in 42 patients (71 %). A cardiac valve was replaced in four patients (7 %) receiving antimicrobial therapy and in six patients (10 %) who had completed antimicrobial therapy. One of the 10 valves taken for culture at surgery was positive, but only for microorganisms that were different from the microorganism isolated before the treatment. The treatment had to be interrupted in four patients because of drug allergy. Other side effects were mild except for two cases of reversible neutropenia. The treatment was easy to administer: 27 patients (46 %) had no permanent intravenous catheter at any time, seven patients (12 %) had such a catheter for less than 4 days. Twenty-three patients (39 %) were discharged from the hospital less than 2 weeks after admission. CONCLUSIONS. [...] Ceftriaxone sodium administered at a <b>once-daily</b> <b>dose</b> of 2 g appears to be an effective and safe treatment of streptococcal endocarditis.
