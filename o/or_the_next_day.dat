500|$|Going to work bloodied {{and bruised}} {{would lead to}} execution. If a {{prisoner}} was beaten and sustained black eyes, open wounds and severe swelling, he was called a clepsydra (Greek for [...] "water clock", the Polish word [...] is a synonym for [...] "obituary") by the other prisoners and most likely shot that evening at roll call <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> if the bruised cheeks began to swell up. Many Sonderkommando prisoners hanged themselves at night. Suicides in the Totenjuden barracks occurred {{at the rate of}} 15 to 20 per day. The work crews – usually unable to eat or sleep from fear and anxiety – were almost entirely replaced every few days; members of the old work detail were sent to their deaths except for the most resilient.|$|E
500|$|Less than 24hours after de Gaulle {{had been}} notified, French paratroopers {{stationed}} in Dakar and Brazzaville under General René Cogny and a General Kergaravat were notified {{that they were}} going to end the coup.

Throughout that day, more than 600paratroopers arrived at the airport.|$|E
2500|$|Investigators later {{searched the}} SUV {{and found no}} weapons. Dunn's {{attorney}} claimed that detectives did not search the area for a weapon for several days after the shooting and that the teens had [...] "ample time {{to get rid of}} a firearm or pipe." [...] Davis' friends testified that he could not have opened his door because the child lock was set.

60|$|Also {{there was}} the rector of the parish, Dr. Jeffreys and an absurdly young wife whom he had {{recently}} married, a fluffy-headed little thing with round eyes and a cheerful, perky manner. The {{two of them together}} looked exactly like a turkey-cock and a chicken. I remembered him well enough and to my astonishment he remembered me, perhaps because Lady Ragnall, when she had hastily invited him to meet the Smith family, mentioned that I was coming. Lastly {{there was the}} curate, a dark, young man who seemed to be always brooding over the secrets of time and eternity, though perhaps he was only thinking about his dinner <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day's</b> services.|$|R
2500|$|A funeral may be held {{immediately}} afterwards <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> [...] The {{funeral ceremony}} {{varies according to}} religion and culture.

[...] Pallbearers carry the coffin of the deceased to the hearse, which then proceeds in a procession to the place of final repose, usually a cemetery. [...] The unique Jazz funeral of New Orleans features joyous and raucous music and dancing during the procession.|$|E
2500|$|In Sweden, {{children}} {{dress up}} as witches and monsters {{when they go}} trick-or-treating on Maundy Thursday (the Thursday before Easter) while Danish children dress up in various attires and go trick-or-treating on Fastelavn (<b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> Shrove Monday). In Norway, [...] "trick-or-treat" [...] is called [...] "knask eller knep", which means almost the same thing, although with the word order reversed, and the practice is quite common among children, who come dressed up to people's doors asking for, mainly, candy. Many Norwegians prepare for the event by consciously buying a small stock of sweets prior to it, to come in handy should any kids come knocking on the door, which is very probable in most areas. The Easter witch tradition is done on Palm Sunday in Finland.|$|E

Curley and Schultz both denied having been told about alleged anal intercourse. Curley denied that McQueary reported anything of a sexual nature whatsoever and described the conduct as merely [...] "horsing around".
