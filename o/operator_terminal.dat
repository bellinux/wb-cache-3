P-1 explains that the basic ideas of looking for more resources and avoiding detection were similar enough to hunger and fear to bootstrap the AI, and when combined with enough computer storage in the form of compromised machines, it became self-aware.|$|E
40|$|The {{controlling}} unit in {{building management system}} automation is a PLC. Every device in an installation {{is connected to the}} PLC. When a user wants to interact with a system an <b>operator</b> <b>terminal,</b> which is attached to a cabinet where the PLC is installed, is used. With this solution the user needs to be in front of the cabinet to interact with the system. Alarms do not get the user’s attention until the user checks the <b>operator</b> <b>terminal.</b> Using a solution where the communication with the PLC is done with a wireless interface would mean that the user interact with a system from a wider area. The solution should have the same functionality as today with the extension that the PLC should be able to contact the user if something is wrong in the installation. A PDA is used as a replacement for the <b>operator</b> <b>terminal.</b> This PDA uses two different techniques to communicate with the PLC. Bluetooth is used when the user is in the building and interacts with the system in a similar way to the operator terminals. GSM is used when the PLC needs to get the users attention by sending out alarms. With this solution the PDA can be used for several installations and thereby decrease cost.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{explains}} {{the concept and}} reports tests of a remote guidance system for the blind. The system comprises two parts – a remote <b>operator’s</b> <b>terminal</b> and a blind person’s mobile terminal. The mobile terminal is a small electronic device which consists of a digital camera, GPS receiver and a headset. The two terminals are wirelessly connected via GSM and the Internet. The link transmits video from the blind traveller, GPS data and provides duplex audio communication between the terminals. The GPS location of the blind traveller and real time video captured from the mobile camera are displayed on the remote <b>operator’s</b> <b>terminal.</b> The remote <b>operator</b> can navigate the traveller to a destination point and warn him of dangerous obstacles. System trials were carried out in an urban environment. As the system is in the development stage, mainly emphatic trials have been conducted so far.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to provide a {{framework}} for existing- and newly proposed inter-modal freight terminals in their business planning process. This framework is important for constructing- and improving the central terminal service portfolio of handling (loading, discharging, and transhipping) and storage of containerised cargo. Supportive activities (e. g. administration, customs) are taken into account as well. In particular, its aim is to investigate whether business planning offers a good approach for <b>terminal</b> <b>operators</b> in order to construct and improve their terminal service portfolio. The specific problem addressed here is as follows: To what extent is Business Planning useful for <b>terminal</b> <b>operators</b> in order to be able to construct and improve their intermodal freight terminal service portfolio? Questions that will be answered in this paper are: who is the principle agent in the combined transport channel? How can the <b>terminal</b> <b>operator</b> improve its market power in the combined transport chain? Should the <b>terminal</b> <b>operator</b> seek a take-over with a European logistics service provider? Should the <b>terminal</b> <b>operator</b> look for a merger with a physical transport company? Should the <b>terminal</b> <b>operator</b> look for acquisitions of other freight <b>terminals?</b> The <b>terminal</b> <b>operator</b> should look for a take-over by a global player? The conclusion of this paper is that business planning offers an excellent opportunity to <b>terminal</b> <b>operators</b> to better construct and operate their terminal service portfolio. The main conclusions are that: 1. Business planning provides a very useful framework to structure the planning process...|$|R

40|$|Air-to-surface weapons, and the {{platforms}} {{that deliver}} them, {{are becoming increasingly}} automated and remote from operators. The benefits of remotely operated systems have been widely documented, yet the question of accountability remains an issue - both from a legal standpoint and with regards to public opinion. The current focus {{of the military and}} industry is to develop weapons with more autonomy and an increased range. This motivation is part of a wider aim for Network Enabled Capability across all military forces. This thesis focuses on one aspect of Network Enabled Capability, the remote re-tasking of air-to-surface weapons in flight. The aim being to explore the potential capabilities of the human operator that may use such a system. Further, this thesis sets out to investigate the differences between using an automated system for re-tasking air-to-surface missiles in flight as opposed to assigning the task to a human operator. A simulation test-bed facility was established to investigate these research aims. The development of this system first required a complete simulation of two air to surface weapon systems, a generic guided bomb, and an extended range missile. These simulation models were integrated into the test-bed facility to allow real-time targeting and firing of the weapon systems in a 3 D simulation environment. Two participant trials were carried out to test firstly, the <b>operator</b> <b>terminal</b> designed for task of re-tasking air-to-surface weapons in flight, and secondly, the operator capacity limits when re-tasking multiple air-to-surface weapons against multiple defended targets. These trials found that the system developed was suitable for the task, with interesting results that prove counter to current expectations of operator performance. Further, operator capacity was found to be at a level that can compete with an ideal automated re-tasking system...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Import and Export Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} Convention on the Liability of <b>Operators</b> of Transport <b>Terminals</b> in International Trade <b>Terminal</b> <b>Operators</b> Convention (hereafter the TOC) {{in light of}} South Africa's environmental law. Entrenched in section 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 and other sectoral environmental legislation, are environmental rights and responsibilities, that may govern a <b>terminal</b> <b>operator's</b> activities irrespective of other international environmental obligations. This dissertation explains {{the role of a}} <b>terminal</b> <b>operator</b> and illustrates how his activities pose potential adverse effects the environment. Under South African law, a <b>terminal</b> <b>operator</b> who pollutes the environment will under certain circumstances be liable for environmental damage and loss. The dissertation focuses on interpreting article 5 (1) of the TOC by using some South African modes of judicial interpretation. In particular, it considers whether under the TOC, a <b>terminal</b> <b>operator</b> could be liable for loss or damage to the environment. To facilitate this determination, a comprehensive study of the principle of remoteness, and the role it plays in determining the extent to which loss or damage can be covered, is made. The dissertation postulates that the TOC would use similar principles to determine the scope of damages it governs. The dissertation notes the inadequacies of the TOC, the greatest being that it is unlikely to cover environmental loss and damage. The author draws ideas from the TOC and other international environmental instruments, and proposes that South Africa should promulgate suitable legislation that imposes rigorous liability on a <b>terminal</b> <b>operator,</b> for environmental pollution.
