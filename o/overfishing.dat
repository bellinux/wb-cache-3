5|$|<b>Overfishing</b> is a {{major threat}} to edible fish such as cod and tuna. <b>Overfishing</b> {{eventually}} causes population (known as stock) collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed. Such commercial extinction {{does not mean that the}} species is extinct, merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} threat to manta rays is <b>overfishing.</b> M. birostris is not evenly distributed over the oceans, but is concentrated in areas that provide the food resources it requires, while M. alfredi is even more localized. Their distributions are thus fragmented, with little evidence of intermingling of subpopulations. Because of their long lifespans and low reproductive rate, <b>overfishing</b> can severely reduce local populations with little likelihood that individuals from elsewhere will replace them.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{populations have}} {{declined}} severely since European colonisation of Australia {{due to a}} number of causes, including severe <b>overfishing,</b> river regulation, and habitat degradation and are now a listed threatened species. However, they once inhabited almost the entire Murray-Darling basin, Australia's largest river system, in very great numbers.|$|E

50|$|In the South-West Atlantic a peak {{was reached}} in the mid-1980s and catches now {{fluctuate}} between 1.7 and 2.6 million tons. The most important species, the Argentine shortfin squid, which reached half a million tons in 2013 or half the peak value, is considered fully fished to <b>overfished.</b> Another important species was the Brazilian sardinella, with a production of 100,000 tons in 2013 it is now considered <b>overfished.</b> Half the stocks {{in this area are}} being fished at unsustainable levels: Whitehead’s round herring has not yet reached fully fished but Cunene horse mackerel is <b>overfished.</b> The sea snail perlemoen abalone is targeted by illegal fishing and remain <b>overfished.</b>|$|R
30|$|Sea {{cucumber}} {{populations are}} being <b>overfished</b> {{all over the}} world. Some reports reported that sea cucumber populations in <b>overfished</b> grounds may demand {{as many as half}} a century in the absence of fishing activities to be rebuilt (Battaglene and Bell 1999; Bruckner et al. 2003; Skewes et al. 2000).|$|R
5|$|Sustainable seafood is seafood {{from either}} fished or farmed sources that can {{maintain}} or increase {{production in the}} future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired.

5|$|Armed {{with large}} teeth {{and a strong}} bite, the kitefin shark is a powerful, solitary {{predator}} that takes {{many different types of}} prey, ranging from bony fishes, sharks and rays, to cephalopods, crustaceans, polychaete worms, siphonophores, and possibly carrion. It also takes bites out of animals larger than itself, similar to its smaller relative, the cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis). This shark is aplacental viviparous and gives birth to 1014 young. The kitefin shark is fished commercially for its meat, skin, and liver oil, primarily by Portugal and Japan. A fishery targeting this species existed off the Azores from the 1970s to the 1990s, but collapsed due to <b>overfishing</b> and falling liver oil prices; the rapid depletion of the Azores stock is often cited {{as an example of the}} susceptibility of deep-sea sharks to human exploitation. The low reproductive rate of this species renders it susceptible to <b>overfishing</b> and, coupled with known population declines, has led it to be assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|As {{frigatebirds}} rely {{on large}} marine predators such as tuna for their prey, <b>overfishing</b> threatens to significantly impact on food availability and jeopardise whole populations. As frigatebirds nest in large dense colonies in small areas, they {{are vulnerable to}} local disasters that could wipe out the rare species or significantly impact the widespread ones.|$|E
50|$|In the Western Central Atlantic catches {{have been}} {{decreasing}} since 2000 and reached 1.3 million tons in 2013. The most important {{species in the}} area, Gulf menhaden, reached a million tons in the mid-1980s but only half a million tons in 2013 and is now considered fully fished. Round sardinella was an important species in the 1990s but is now considered <b>overfished.</b> Groupers and snappers are <b>overfished</b> and northern brown shrimp and American cupped oyster are considered fully fished approaching <b>overfished.</b> 44% of stocks are being fished at unsustainable levels.|$|R

5|$|Human {{activities}} have affected stocks of {{many species of}} teleost, through <b>overfishing,</b> pollution and global warming. Among many recorded instances, <b>overfishing</b> caused the complete collapse of the Atlantic cod population off Newfoundland in 1992, leading to Canada's indefinite closure of the fishery. Pollution, especially in rivers and along coasts, has harmed teleosts as sewage, pesticides and herbicides have entered the water. Many pollutants, such as heavy metals, organochlorines, and carbamates interfere with teleost reproduction, often by disrupting their endocrine systems. In the roach, river pollution has caused the intersex condition, in which an individual's gonads contain both cells that can make male gametes (such as spermatogonia) and cells that can make female gametes (such as oogonia). Since endocrine disruption also affects humans, teleosts are used to indicate the presence of such chemicals in water. Water pollution caused local extinction of teleost populations in many northern European lakes {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|Murray cod {{have died}} out {{in many of}} their upland habitats, {{particularly}} in the southern Murray-Darling basin, due {{to a combination of}} <b>overfishing,</b> siltation, dams and weirs blocking migration, pollution from arsenic-based sheep-dips, mining, and in some cases, introduced trout stockings, which causes competition between juvenile Murray cod and introduced trout species.|$|E

5|$|Sea silk is a {{fine fabric}} woven from the byssus threads of bivalves, {{particularly}} the pen shell (Pinna nobilis). It used to be produced in the Mediterranean region where these shells are endemic. It was an expensive fabric and <b>overfishing</b> has much reduced populations of the pen shell. There is mention in the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone (196 BCE) of this cloth being used to pay taxes.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable {{in the northwestern}} Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico.

5|$|While {{extremely}} severe {{commercial and}} recreational <b>overfishing</b> in the 1800s {{and the early}} 1900s caused the first strong declines of Murray cod, <b>overfishing</b> by recreational fishermen, aided by inadequate fishing regulations, continues today and remains an extremely serious threat to Murray cod. The current size limit of 60centimetres in most states is inadequate now that scientific studies have documented average size at sexual maturity in Murray cod. This and catch data and computer modelling exercises on wild Murray cod stocks indicate measures such as raising the size limit to 70centimetres and reducing the bag and possession limits from 2 and 4 fish respectively to 1 fish are urgently needed to maintain the long-term viability of wild Murray cod populations. As of November 2014, the NSW Department of Fisheries has introduced a maximum size limit of 75cm for Murray Cod to provide protection for large breeding fish, {{as well as a}} new minimum size limit of 55cm.|$|E
5|$|Within the conch fisheries, one of {{the threats}} to {{sustainability}} {{stems from the fact}} that there is almost as much meat in large juveniles as there is in adults, but only adult conchs can reproduce, and thus sustain a population. In many places where adult conchs have become rare due to <b>overfishing,</b> larger juveniles and subadults are taken before they ever mate. On a number of islands, subadults provide the majority of the harvest.|$|E

5|$|All three {{thresher}} shark species were reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. The rapid {{collapse of the}} Californian subpopulation (over 50% within three generations) prompted concerns regarding the species' susceptibility to <b>overfishing</b> in other areas, where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history and population structure are little-known. In addition to continued fishing pressure, common threshers are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps, and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs {{are under}} stress around the world. In particular, coral mining, {{agricultural}} and urban runoff, pollution (organic and inorganic), <b>overfishing,</b> blast fishing, disease, and the digging of canals and access into islands and bays are localized threats to coral ecosystems. Broader threats are sea temperature rise, sea level rise and pH changes from ocean acidification, all associated with greenhouse gas emissions. In 1998, 16% of the world's reefs {{died as a}} result of increased water temperature.|$|E
5|$|Fisheries {{also have}} {{negative}} effects on seabirds, and these effects, particularly on the long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, {{are a source of}} increasing concern to conservationists. The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when <b>overfishing</b> occurs.|$|E
