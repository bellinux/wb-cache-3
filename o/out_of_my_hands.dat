500|$|Two staff {{died during}} development: {{one in a}} {{motorcycle}} accident and the other from suicide. Futatsugi attributed the deaths to the stressful working conditions of the video game industry. In 2013, he said: [...] "All we could do was carry on and finish the game - it was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands.</b> Part of me did want to stop though. That was definitely the toughest project I've ever worked on. Personal relationships became strained. The stress was overwhelming." [...] Despite {{the difficulty of the}} project, he felt it had benefited from having [...] "someone who plays the bad guy role, someone who acts a little selfish, acts a little forceful to the team to achieve specific goals ... Having team members that will support that kind of bad cop is necessary, and if they don't exist then you can't get those kind of results." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gene Tenace, {{who caught}} Gaylord Perry when they {{played for the}} San Diego Padres, said: [...] "I can {{remember}} a couple of occasions when I couldn't throw the ball back to him {{because it was so}} greasy that it slipped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands.</b> I just walked out to the mound and flipped the ball back to him." ...|$|E
60|$|LUBIN. You {{and your}} {{newspaper}} confederates took the peace <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands.</b> The peace {{did not find}} me out {{because it did not}} find me in.|$|E

6000|$|... "Steady!" [...] Wannop cautioned. [...] "You nearly {{knocked the}} whip <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand.</b> Keep {{that kind of}} thing for the ballroom--it's wasted on your brother." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Hand</b> is a 2015 American drama film {{directed}} by Takeshi Fukunaga. It was screened in the Panorama {{section of the}} 65th Berlin International Film Festival.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, I {{prefer to}} fetch him myself--he don't get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands.</b> Besides, I've {{got to go}} to the ship to get a rope, anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Gracie, if {{you could}} have heard how utterly without {{principle}} she is: urging me to put my property <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> dishonestly, to keep her in luxury!" ...|$|E
60|$|I fancied I {{heard the}} muffled gurgle of a mocking laugh. I took my face <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> and saw my enemy sinking back upon his {{inclined}} board.|$|E
60|$|Euphemia {{knelt down}} and rapidly wound several yards of the slack cord around the stake. In a few moments it {{tightened}} again, jerking itself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Roy, you shore don't savvy the way {{to break}} these wild ones," [...] drawled Las Vegas. [...] "Bo will be eatin' <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> in about a week." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed to}} lose all {{patience}} with me. She snatched the book <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> and opened it before me on the table by which we were standing side by side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{intentions}} were, no doubt, good, {{but please}} remember in future that I can't permit things that concern {{me to be}} taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands.</b> I believe I'm still capable of managing my affairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|Decision was {{in reality}} taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> by the baggageman who said in {{response}} to inquiry, [...] "I put your trunk on the 8:40 train. It is {{well on its way}} to New York." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I her keeper?" [...] I felt {{inclined}} to ask; but I simply answered, [...] "I have shaken her well, {{and would have}} shaken her better, but she escaped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> and ran away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] {{said his}} friend, [...] "excepting that when I first entered this cursed ruinous labyrinth, {{the light was}} struck <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> as if by a switch, which obliged me to return for another." ...|$|R
5000|$|... : [...] "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, {{and they}} follow me. I give them eternal life, {{and they will}} never perish, {{and no one will}} snatch them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>My</b> Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Fatherâ€™s hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the same}} time, I felt his book gently taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand.</b> Cristel had been reading, while I read, over my shoulder. She {{wrote on the}} next blank leaf: [...] "Shall I make the tea?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you; as you {{say there}} has been fraud, I should be better {{satisfied}} {{to be able to}} tell Mr. Dynevor that the papers have never been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands.</b> I will call on you early to-morrow.' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me for a moment with a grave and steady attention, as if she was fixing what I said in her mind. Then she took the broom <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> and moved off with it slowly, a little way down the corridor.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't believe," [...] went on Woods quietly, {{as if he}} were {{thinking}} aloud, [...] "that if accounts had been square between you and me, all the money in all the banks in New York could have bought you <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, {{put him in}} a cage, {{and bring}} him up tame," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I mean to teach him to eat <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand.</b> I shall treat him very kindly, though he is my little prisoner." ...|$|R
6000|$|As I {{spoke the}} words--whish!--a cannon-ball cut the tumbler clean <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> and plumped into poor O'Gawler's stomach. It settled him completely, {{and of course}} I never got my seven hundred rupees. Such are the {{uncertainties}} of war! ...|$|R
6000|$|I humored the idea. I {{came forward}} under an {{imaginary}} guard of the enemy's soldiers, produced my paper, {{and read it}} through. For answer, Clarence struck the paper <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> pursed up a scornful lip and said with lofty disdain: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing at all,' was the {{somewhat}} impatient reply. 'I trust {{never to have}} to consider. Get it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> at any sacrifice, so as it may do the least harm to others. Had I no other objection to that business, I should have no choice.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, thank you. She is {{well taken}} care of, I suppose. I am glad she is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands.</b> She was a {{nuisance}} to me, and I {{am not a}} very edifying example for her. What on earth should I {{want to see her}} for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Give me back those papers! give me back those papers!' She tore them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> {{and tossed}} {{them on her}} table. Then seating herself defiantly in her great chair, and folding her arms, she stabbed me to the heart with the unlooked-for reproach, 'You worldly wretch!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] said he, [...] "it's mor'n I kin," [...] and {{he jerked}} his coat <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> and sprang away. When he reached {{the other side of}} the road, he turned and shouted at me, as though I had been deaf.|$|R
60|$|I pulled two {{or three}} little thorns <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> and sat for a time on a boulder <b>of</b> rock. <b>My</b> muscles were quivering, and I had that feeling of {{personal}} disillusionment that comes at the first fall to the learner of cycling on earth.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{never told}} that {{incident}} {{to any one}} until this evening," [...] my nurse concluded, as she took the empty port wine glass <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> and stirred the fire. [...] "A nurse wouldn't get many engagements if she had the reputation for making blunders of that sort." ...|$|R
60|$|Of course I was puzzled; {{it was not}} in {{that fashion}} that I had {{expected}} Madame Blumenthal to make use of my information. But the matter now was quite <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> and all I could do was to bid my companion not work himself into a fever over either fortune.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{though you}} know the reasons which induce me to take her away from England before she slips entirely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> and ruins all our hopes?" [...] But still the Serjeant shook his head. [...] "Every one is leagued against me," [...] said the Countess, {{throwing}} up her hands in despair.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} be very good for Arghouse if I did {{such a thing as}} that," [...] {{returned}} Harold. [...] "No, poor old Eu, I'm not going to disturb him because he has got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> and I think she will take care of the people. I daresay I bullied him more than was bearable." ...|$|E
6000|$|Evidently Jake had a {{vulnerable}} point. He straightened {{up with a}} little swagger. [...] "Wal, you watch me," [...] he said. [...] "I'll fetch the big Dutchman eatin' <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand....</b> An' say, when we git him in the car an' start back let's scare the daylights <b>out</b> <b>of</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. Travers. [...] "I {{had just}} then pulled <b>out</b> <b>my</b> watch. <b>Of</b> course it flew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> but it hung by the chain. Somebody trampled on it. The hands are broken off short. It keeps on ticking but I can't tell the time. It's absurd. Most provoking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please, sir--no, sir;" [...] (whimpering), [...] "but Master Jacky {{forced it}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> sir, {{and insisted on}} {{carrying}} it. He saw that I was very tired, sir--and so I am, but I would not have asked him to carry it, if I had been ever so tired--indeed I would not, sir." ...|$|R
