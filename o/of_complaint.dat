5|$|Shortly before Anselm {{went into}} exile in 1097 Warelwast searched his baggage, {{probably}} looking for communications to the pope, either from Anselm or other English bishops {{rather than for}} valuables, and in particular for any letters <b>of</b> <b>complaint.</b> Warelwast was the king's envoy at Rome when during his exile Anselm petitioned to have the king excommunicated, which according to Eadmer, who was also present, Warelwast succeeded in preventing by bribing the pope and papal officials. The king had sent Warelwast to Urban at Christmas 1098, with his reply to a letter the pope had written ordering the restoration of Anselm's estates.|$|E
5|$|Many {{tensions}} existed {{within the}} system of government. Royal landownings and wealth stretched across England, and placed the king in a privileged position above even {{the most powerful of}} the noble elite. Successive kings, though, still needed more resources to pay for military campaigns, conduct building programmes or to reward their followers, and this meant exercising their feudal rights to interfere in the land-holdings of nobles. This was contentious and a frequent issue <b>of</b> <b>complaint,</b> as there was a growing belief that land should be held by hereditary right, not through the favour of the king. Property and wealth became increasingly focused {{in the hands of a}} subset of the nobility, the great magnates, at the expense of the wider baronage, encouraging the breakdown of some aspects of local feudalism. As time went by, the Norman nobility intermarried with many of the great Anglo-Saxon families, and the links with the Duchy began to weaken. By the late 12th century, mobilising the English barons to fight on the continent was proving difficult, and John's attempts to do so ended in civil war. Civil strife re-emerged under Henry III, with the rebel barons in 1258–59 demanding widespread reforms, and an early version of Parliament was summoned in 1265 to represent the rebel interests.|$|E

5|$|Motte, {{without power}} {{to halt the}} {{introduction}} of Faulkner's work on his own, asked Swift to intervene, but Swift passively refused. Even without the backing of Swift, Motte turned to the English legal system to halt the introduction of Faulkner's edition. Motte issued a Bill <b>of</b> <b>Complaint</b> and sued under the Statute of Anne, claiming that Faulkner's publishing of the 1735 Works infringed on his right to publish works like Gulliver's Travels. The case was heard by the Court of Chancery, and they agreed with Motte in a ruling by Lord Talbot, the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain. In the 28 November 1735, it was determined Motte could put forth an injunction to the whole of Swift's works. Although works like the Drapier's Letters were not under Motte's copyright and some works were printed before 1709, Faulkner's complete work was legally brought to a halt from being published in England.|$|E

40|$|Background Results of {{existing}} studies are inconclusive concerning {{the relationship between}} chemotherapy and subjective cognitive functioning (SCF). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate SCF of breast cancer (BC) patients and to find predictors of impaired SCF. Both satisfaction and frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF were measured. Methods BC patients who were about to receive chemotherapy (N[*]=[*] 74) and patients with a benign breast disease (BBD) (N[*]=[*] 63) participated. Before chemotherapy started (Time 1) and 3 [*]months after ending chemotherapy (and at comparable moments for the BBD group) (Time 2), women completed validated questionnaires concerning the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> and satisfaction with SCF, fatigue, perceived stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Results No differences were found between the BBD and BC patients concerning the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF across time. Satisfaction with SCF decreased across time in BC patients but remained stable across time in BBD patients (p[*]<[*] 0. 001; p[*]=[*] 0. 003 after controlling for state anxiety and perceived stress). Correlation coefficients between the satisfaction and the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF ranged between − 0. 26 and − 0. 49. Depressive symptoms and satisfaction with SCF (Time 1) predicted the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF (Time 2). Diagnosis, frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF, and state anxiety (Time 1) predicted satisfaction with SCF (Time 2). Conclusions BC patients do not differ in the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF compared with BBD patients, but their satisfaction with SCF decreased after treatment. Psychological factors predicted the frequency <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> about SCF. Psychological factors and diagnosis predicted satisfaction with SCF...|$|R
