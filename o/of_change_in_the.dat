The Commission was meant to address many of the inequalities women face, specifically rape, family and guardianship. However, the slow pace <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> judicial system and the aforementioned cultural norms have prevented the full adoption of policies meant to promote equality between men and women.|$|E

5|$|The late 18th {{century was}} a period <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{interior}} design of English country houses. The Baroque concept of the principal floor, or piano nobile, with a large bedroom suite known as the state apartments, was gradually abandoned in favour of smaller, more private bedrooms on the upper floors. The principal floor became a series of reception rooms, each with a designated purpose, creating separate withdrawing, dining, music, and ballrooms. In the late-18th century, it became common to arrange reception and public rooms on a lower floor, with bedrooms and more private rooms above. West Wycombe perfectly reflects this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Harrison was {{admitted}} to the New York State bar in 1892 and worked for the law firm Bangs, Stetson, Tracy & MacVeagh from 1892 to 1896. He then joined the Southern Railway Company in May 1896 as a lawyer, becoming an assistant to the company's president in 1903. He served as vice-president in charge of finance and accounting from 1906. During the Panic of 1907, Harrison successfully persuaded J. P. Morgan to purchase bonds in the Southern to keep the company solvent. After the panic had subsided, Harrison was named president of the Chicago, Indianapolis and Louisville Railway, later the Monon Railroad (succeeded Ira G. Rawn after Rawn's death), which was jointly owned by Southern and the Louisville & Nashville Railroad. William Finley, president of the Southern Railway, died on November 23, 1913, and Harrison was elected as his successor eight days later. Besides the chairmanship of the Southern Railway, he was also elected to succeed Finley on three subsidiary railroads. His election was considered to be a sign <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern United States, especially in its railroads, both because he was a southerner and for his activism on behalf of the south.|$|E

In this paper, counterfactual distributions are derived by recovering the conditional distribution via a set of quantile regressions, and correcting for the endogeneity of schooling decisions using a control function approach. Our proposal enables us to isolate the effect on <b>the</b> wage distribution <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> conditional and unconditional distribution <b>of</b> schooling and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> unobserved ability. This methodology is used to analyze <b>the</b> sources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> wage distribution that took place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States between 1983 and 1993, using proximity to college for different parental background as instruments. Our results show that <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> ability had {{a negative effect on}} wages at the low quantiles, which almost compensates the positive effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> schooling distribution over this period. It is also found that the impact on wages <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conditional distribution <b>of</b> unobserved ability is larger than <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conditional distribution <b>of</b> distance to college.

25|$|The {{existence}} of races is a token <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human species, and suggests {{there is some}} significance in geographical separation. Lawrence noted that racial characteristics were inherited, not caused by the direct effect of, for instance, climate. As an example, he considered the way skin colour was inherited by children of African origin when born in temperate climates: how their colour developed without exposure to the sun, and how this continued through generations. This was evidence against the direct effect of climate.|$|E
25|$|A {{problem with}} the {{derivative}} term is that it amplifies higher frequency measurement or process noise that can cause large amounts <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> output. It is often helpful to filter the measurements with a low-pass filter in order to remove higher-frequency noise components. As low-pass filtering and derivative control can cancel each other out, the amount of filtering is limited. So low noise instrumentation can be important. A nonlinear median filter may be used, which improves the filtering efficiency and practical performance. In some cases, the differential band can be turned off with little loss of control. This is equivalent to using the PID controller as a PI controller.|$|E

Anti-war groups invited the actress and activist Jane Fonda to Fayetteville to participate in three anti-war events. At this time, Fayetteville also made headlines after Army doctor Jeffrey R.
