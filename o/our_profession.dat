500|$|On October 14, Specter {{reported}} he {{had raised}} $1.8 {{million during the}} previous three-month period, bringing his total to about $8.7 million. The Senator {{said that he was}} aided in large part by his September 15 fundraiser hosted by Obama. In that same period, Sestak raised only $758,000, about a quarter million dollars lower than the previous quarter, making his total allocation about $4.7 million. Sestak continued working hard to overcome his name recognition problem, seldom turning down interview requests and asking his staff to work six 12-hour days a week. As a result, Sestak saw a large amount of turnover in his staff, going through nearly half a dozen press secretaries and several chiefs of staff. Sestak called on Specter participate in six debates, one for each media market in Pennsylvania, but Specter only agreed to participate in one because that was the amount of debates he participated in as a Republican. On December 7, Sestak was endorsed by Congressman Barney Frank, who said that he was impressed by Sestak's leadership on economic and military issues, as well as his positions against the military's [...] "don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy and the Defense of Marriage Act. The endorsement was important to Sestak {{because it was the first}} time a prominent member of Congress broke with the Democratic establishment to back him over Specter. Frank also said of Specter's switching parties, [...] "I have to say I don't think it did <b>our</b> <b>profession</b> any good for someone to announce that he switched parties purely so he could survive." ...|$|E

2500|$|The second preface {{was called}} , {{a long and}} learned essay that defends the {{undertaking}} of the new version.

[...] They also give their opinion of previous English Bible translations, stating, [...] "We do not deny, nay, we affirm and avow, that the very meanest translation of the Bible in English, set forth by men of <b>our</b> <b>profession,</b> (for we have seen none of theirs [...] of the whole Bible as yet) containeth the word of God, nay, is the word of God."

40|$|This article {{suggests}} {{that there may be}} profound obstacles to our capacity to work together effectively across professional or disciplinary boundaries. These problems are rooted in our love of ourselves and <b>our</b> <b>professions</b> and <b>our</b> dislike of those not like us, dynamics which are also central to the production of our positive professional identities. Such a thickly textured notion of professional identity is at odds with contemporary health and welfare policy trends which stress ‘role performance’ as the start and finish of professional activity. Such shallow concepts of identity are an affront to the real ethical difficulties facing us as we struggle to move beyond professional narcissism and engage with the different professional ‘other’. ...|$|R
