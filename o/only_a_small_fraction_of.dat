5|$|A 2006 {{study of}} inland {{bodies of water}} around Canberra where wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles share territories showed little overlap {{in the range of}} prey taken. Wedge-tailed eagles took rabbits, various macropods, {{terrestrial}} birds such as cockatoos and parrots, and various passerines including magpies and starlings. White-bellied sea eagles caught fish, water-dwelling reptiles such as the eastern long-necked turtle and Australian water dragon, and waterbirds such as ducks, grebes and coots. Both species preyed on the maned duck. Rabbits constituted <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the white-bellied sea eagle's diet.

5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based {{techniques such}} as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in adaptive optics have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of {{any part of the}} night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.|$|E
5|$|During a total solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow covers <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the Earth. The Earth {{continues}} to receive at least 92 {{percent of the}} amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse–more if the penumbra of the Moon's shadow partly misses the Earth. Seen from the Moon, the Earth during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth reflects a lot of light to the Moon. If the corona of the eclipsed Sun were not present, the Moon, illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the earthshine which can frequently be seen when the Moon's phase is a narrow crescent. In reality, the corona, though much less brilliant than the Sun's photosphere, is much brighter than the Moon illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, the Moon during a total solar eclipse appears to be black, with the corona surrounding it.|$|E

5|$|Tethys is {{the third}} largest of Saturn's inner moons. Its most {{prominent}} features are a large (400km diameter) impact crater named Odysseus on its leading hemisphere and a vast canyon system named Ithaca Chasma extending at least 270° around Tethys. The Ithaca Chasma is concentric with Odysseus, and these two features may be related. Tethys appears to have no current geological activity. A heavily cratered hilly terrain occupies {{the majority of its}} surface, while a smaller and smoother plains region lies on the hemisphere opposite to that of Odysseus. The plains contain fewer craters and are apparently younger. A sharp boundary separates them from the cratered terrain. There is also a system of extensional troughs radiating away from Odysseus.

Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells.

Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure.
