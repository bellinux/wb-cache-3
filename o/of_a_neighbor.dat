5|$|Allen's {{exploits}} {{in those}} years {{introduced him to the}} wrong side of the justice system, which would become a recurring feature of his life. In one incident, he and his brother Heman went to the farm <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor,</b> some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land, and seized the pigs. The neighbor sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen pleaded his own case, and lost. Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings, and the neighbor was awarded another five shillings in damages. He was also called to court in Salisbury for inoculating himself against smallpox, a procedure that at the time required the sanction of the town selectmen.|$|E
25|$|The popular {{image is}} of Johnny Appleseed {{spreading}} apple seeds randomly everywhere he went. In fact, he planted nurseries rather than orchards, built fences around them {{to protect them}} from livestock, left the nurseries in the care <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> who sold trees on shares, and returned every year or two to tend the nursery. His first nursery was planted on the bank of Brokenstraw Creek, south of Warren, Pennsylvania. Next, he seems to have moved to Venango County along the shore of French Creek, but many of these nurseries were in the Mohican area of north-central Ohio. This area included the towns of Mansfield, Lisbon, Lucas, Perrysville, and Loudonville.|$|E

The Anvil was one of the first student-run newspapers to comment on national and state politics.|$|E

25|$|Although {{initially}} {{put off by}} Mrs Burton-Cox's attitude, Mrs Oliver {{decides to}} resolve the issue after consulting with Celia about her parents' death, and invites her friend Hercule Poirot to solve the disquieting puzzle. Together, they conduct interviews with several elderly witnesses associated with the case, whom they term “elephants”, based on the assumption that, like the proverbial elephants, they may have long memories. Each individual witness recalls a different set of circumstances, but Poirot notes two items of significance - the first being that Margaret Ravenscroft was seriously bitten by the otherwise devoted family dog a few days before her death, and that she had four wigs in her possession {{at the time of her}} death. Further investigation by himself and Mrs Oliver soon reveals that her maiden name was Preston-Grey, and that she had an identical twin sister called Dorothea. While Margaret led a fairly ordinary life, her sister spent protracted periods of her life in psychiatric nursing homes, after she was strongly suspected of being involved in two violent incidents: the first occurred in India when, following the death of her husband, Major Jarrow, Dorothea drowned their infant son and blamed it on an Indian ayah; the second occurred in Malaya when she was with the Ravenscrofts, in which she attacked the child <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> of theirs. She soon joined them at their home in Overcliffe, whereupon she apparently sleep-walked off a cliff one evening and died; the deaths of Alistair and Margaret occurred less than a month after this.|$|E

A rich uncle who was fond of Maria, unaware of Venables' true character, arranged a marriage for her and gave her a dowry of £5,000.|$|E

2500|$|Hisbah ( [...] ḥisb(ah), or hisba) is a {{historic}} Islamic doctrine which means [...] "accountability".

The doctrine states that it is the divinely sanctioned duty of the ruler to intervene when such charges are made, and coercively [...] "command right and forbid wrong" [...] in order to keep everything in order according to sharia. Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya (considered a terrorist organization) suggest that enforcement of sharia under the Hisbah doctrine is the sacred duty of all Muslims, not just rulers.|$|E

2500|$|The case of Kitty Genovese {{is often}} cited and {{occasionally}} criticized {{as an example of}} the [...] "bystander effect". It is also the case that originally stimulated social psychological research in this area. On March 13, 1964 Genovese, 28 years old, was on her way back to her apartment in Queens, New York, from work at 3am when she was stabbed, sexually assaulted, and murdered in front of multiple witnesses. According to newspaper accounts, the attack lasted for at least a half an hour during which time Genovese screamed and pleaded for help. The murderer attacked Genovese and stabbed her, then fled the scene after attracting the attention <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor.</b> The killer then returned ten minutes later and finished the assault. Newspaper reports after Genovese's death claimed that 38 witnesses watched the stabbings and failed to intervene or even contact the police until after the attacker fled and Genovese had died. This led to widespread public attention, and many editorials. Psychology researchers Latané and Darley attributed the lack of help by witnesses to diffusion of responsibility. Because each witness saw others witnessing the same event, they assumed that the others would be taking responsibility and calling the police, and therefore did nothing to stop the situation themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Lawrence {{had first}} {{arrived at the}} Spade Ranch in 1909 {{at the age of}} {{thirteen}} and grew up observing and working for its owners. In 1908 Bixby's father James, an eastern professor who had moved west for a position at the Spade School, filed on and moved to a section of land four miles (6km) east of the Spade Ranch Headquarters. On March 3, 1909 the rest of the Bixby family arrived at the depot in Ellsworth. From the back of the wagon, as they freighted north from Ellsworth, Lawrence led their milk cow, Old Roanie, and as they passed the Spade Ranch store, Mike Peterson saw them from the front porch. The Spade Foreman laughed when he saw the Bixby piano in the wagon. [...] "I'll just give them six months," [...] he said. Bixby's mother Jennie worked as a ranch cook at the Spade Headquarters Cookhouse. Lawrence would later recall, [...] "Every time some old drunken cook drank up the extract, the foreman would send someone after mother. I used to go up and help her at the cookhouse. I rode Old Plunger and had an eleven dollar Sears Roebuck saddle." [...] In March 1909 James took Lawrence to a cattle sale near Hay Springs, Nebraska. There they bought 28 head of heifers for $467.00. This was the start of Bixby's herd and with the help <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> they trailed the cattle south for the Spade. They stayed the first night at Newton's Ranch and the next at Sam Green's. [...] "Mr. Green couldn't read nor write," [...] Lawrence wrote, [...] "but he would tell us wonderful stories about Quantrill's Raiders. We stopped at the Spade and branded our heifers with the J Lazy B but before long Newton came with the sheriff and said he was short two white-faced heifers. We had no way to prove what we knew had happened, so we had to see them go". James chose the tranquil name of Cloverleaf Ranch for their new homestead but in the first year a rattlesnake bit their dog Spot, James killed a wolf and a neighbor threatened to contest Lawrence's sister Ina's homestead filing unless they gave him a cow, calf and a spool of wire.|$|E
