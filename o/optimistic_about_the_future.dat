5|$|Throughout the Vietnam War, Lê Duẩn took an {{aggressive}} posture. He saw attack {{as the key}} to victory. When the North finally won the war in 1975, Lê Duẩn and his associates were overly <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> The Second Five-Year Plan (1976–1980) was a failure and left the Vietnamese economy in crisis. Vietnam was then headed by a gerontocracy (in which the rulers are much older than the average adult). Vietnam became internationally isolated during Lê Duẩn's rule. In 1979 the country had invaded Kampuchea and ousted Pol Pot, fought a war with China and became dependent on Soviet economic aid. Lê Duẩn died in July 1986 and was succeeded by Trường Chinh.|$|E

500|$|Angelou was an {{inspiration}} to the modern hip-hop community. [...] Artists such as Danny Brown, Lupe Fiasco, Jean Grae, and The Roots mention her in their songs. [...] Tupac Shakur, who appeared in the film Poetic Justice, which featured Angelou's poetry, named his album Still I Rise, released in 1999 after his death, for Angelou's poem. Nicki Minaj wrote a song also called [...] "Still I Rise", for her 2009 mixtape Beam Me Up Scotty. [...] Although Minaj's song does not mention Angelou explicitly, its themes of overcoming hardship echo the themes in Angelou's poem.

[...] On [...] "My Way", he meditates over his rise out of poverty to the [...] "life of a rich thug", recalls the death of his childhood friend Ill Will, and concedes that he [...] "still feels broke with millions in the bank." [...] On [...] "U Gotta Love It", Nas makes reference to the [...] "'86 crack blitz" [...] and discusses his own significance: [...] "This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment / Now back in the , certain cats they wanna kill me / They ice-grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me." [...] "Nothing Lasts Forever" [...] advises to appreciate life's small epiphanies and be <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> On [...] "No Idea's Original", Nas notes the similarities of people in life and views other rappers as creatively derivative, while distinguishing himself from them: [...] "No idea's original, there's nothin new under the sun / It's never what you do, but how it's done / What you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper / That means you inferior, not major."

2500|$|The Mona Lisa {{has survived}} {{for more than}} 500 years, and an {{international}} commission convened in 1952 noted that [...] "the picture is in a remarkable state of preservation."

[...] Nevertheless, applications of varnish made to the painting had darkened even by the end of the 16th century, and an aggressive 1809 cleaning and revarnishing removed some of the uppermost portion of the paint layer, resulting in a washed-out appearance to the face of the figure.

50|$|Additionally, options, {{which are}} tied to firm performance, were {{taken into account in}} Lee, Hwang, and Chen's study to measure {{overconfidence}} as most CEOs, founders or non-founders, are compensated in options to an extent. When analyzing option-exercise behavior using the value of vested in-the-money options to the total compensation, they concluded that founder CEOs had a significantly greater ratio. By comparison, they concluded that non-founder CEOs generally exercise their options immediately when they become exercisable in-the-money to receive cash and remove their compensation linkage to future performance. Founder CEOs, however, hold off on exercising their in-the-money options as they are overly <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> firm's <b>future</b> performance.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple Keynesian {{business}} cycle {{model in which}} national income expectations of heterogeneous interacting investors affect their investment decisions. The investors' expectation formation is influenced by their sentiment: investors who hold <b>optimistic</b> views <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> state of <b>the</b> economy expect a higher aggregate demand in the following period and thus invest more than pessimistic investors. The investors' sentiment is, in turn, subject to socio-economic interactions. Simulations show that our model {{has the potential to}} generate complex business cycle dynamics. Based on that framework, we provide a three-country model of business cycle synchronization in which spill-over effects on the level of sentiment synchronize national cycles, provided that investors believe that the economies are indeed coupled. ...|$|R
