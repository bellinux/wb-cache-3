50|$|In the {{analysis}} of the system, various assumptions are made. The liquid, conventionally denoted A, is neither soluble in the gas in the tube, conventionally denoted B, nor reacts with it. The decrease in volume of the liquid A and increase in volume of the gas B over time can be ignored for the purposes of solving the equations that describe the behaviour, and an assumption can be made that the instantaneous flux at any time is the steady state value. There are no radial or circumferential components to the concentration gradients, resulting from convection or turbulence caused by excessively vigorous flow at the upper mouth of the tube, and the diffusion can thus be treated as a simple <b>one-dimensional</b> <b>flow</b> in the vertical direction. The mole fraction of A at the upper mouth of the tube is zero, {{as a consequence of the}} gas flow.
