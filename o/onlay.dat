40|$|Dental <b>onlays</b> are restorations used {{to repair}} rear teeth {{that have a}} mild to {{moderate}} amount of decay. They {{can also be used}} to restore teeth that are cracked or fractured if the damage is not severe enough to require a dental crown. The use of <b>onlays</b> requires less tooth reduction than does the use of metal fillings. This allows dentists to conserve more of a patient's natural tooth structure in the treatment process. The aims of this study are to evaluate the biomechanical comportment of the dental <b>onlays,</b> by using the 3 D photo elasticity method and to investigate the integrity of the structures and their fitting to the dental support. For this optical coherence tomography and micro-computed tomography were employed. Both methods were used to investigate 37 dental <b>onlays,</b> 17 integral polymeric and 20 integral ceramic. The results permit to observe materials defects inside the ceramic or polymeric <b>onlays</b> situate in the biomechanically tensioned areas that could lead to fracture of the prosthetic structure. Marginal fitting problems of the <b>onlays</b> related to the teeth preparations were presented in order to observe the possibility of secondary cavities. The resulted images from the optical coherence tomography were verified by the micro-computed tomography. In conclusion, the optical coherence tomography can be used as a clinical method in order to evaluate the integrity of the dental ceramic and polymeric <b>onlays</b> and to investigate the quality of the marginal fitting to the teeth preparations.

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the fracture resistance of human maxillary premolars restored with 2 ceramic systems (Vitadur Alpha and In Ceram) comparing 3 preparation designs and 2 luting agents. MethodsSeventy sound teeth were prepared to receive ceramic restorations (Vitadur Alpha; n= 14) as follows: (1) control, sound premolars, with no preparation, (2) inlays, (3) partial <b>onlays</b> (palatal cuspid coverage), (4) total <b>onlays</b> (both cuspids coverage), and (5) total <b>onlays</b> with an In Ceram core. The ceramic restorations were cemented using Enforce or RelyX ARC (half restorations with each cement), placed into the cavity and held under pressure, except for the control group. The teeth were subjected to compressive axial loading at 0. 5 mmmin− 1 using a 9 mm steel ball until fracture. Data were analyzed by 3 -way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's test (α=. 05). ResultsThere was a significant difference between cements and among preparation designs (P. 05). Partial and total <b>onlays</b> did not statistically differ and showed the weakest performance. The use of an In Ceram core did not produce higher fracture resistance. ConclusionsWithin the limitations of this study, the cements tested had different mechanical properties, while cuspid coverage did not result in improved fracture resistance of the restored teeth...|$|R

50|$|When decay or {{fracture}} incorporate {{areas of}} a tooth that make amalgam or composite restorations inadequate, such as cuspal fracture or remaining tooth structure that undermines perimeter {{walls of a}} tooth, an <b>onlay</b> might be indicated. Similar to an inlay, an <b>onlay</b> is an indirect restoration which incorporates a cusp or cusps by covering or onlaying the missing cusps. All {{of the benefits of}} an inlay are present in the <b>onlay</b> restoration. The <b>onlay</b> allows for conservation of tooth structure when the only alternative is to totally eliminate cusps and perimeter walls for restoration with a crown. Just as inlays, onlays are fabricated outside of the mouth and are typically made out of gold or porcelain. Gold restorations have been around for many years and have an excellent track record. In recent years, newer types of porcelains have been developed that seem to rival the longevity of gold. If the <b>onlay</b> or inlay is made in a dental laboratory, a temporary is fabricated while the restoration is custom-made for the patient. A return visit is then required to fit the final prosthesis. Inlays and onlays may also be fabricated out of porcelain and delivered the same day utilizing techniques and technologies relating to CAD/CAM dentistry.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{objective}} of this follow-up {{study was to examine}} the performance of Cerec inlays and <b>onlays,</b> all of which were placed by the same clinician, in terms of clinical quality over a functional period of 15 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 200 Cerec inlays and <b>onlays</b> placed consecutively in a private practice by one of the authors (TO) between 1989 and early 1991, 187 were closely monitored over a period of 15 years. All ceramic inlays and <b>onlays</b> had been placed chairside using the Cerec 1 method and had been luted with a bonding composite. Up to 17 years after their placement, a follow-up assessment was conducted, and the restorations were classified using modified United States Public Health Service criteria. RESULTS: According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, the success rate of Cerec inlays and <b>onlays</b> was 88. 7 % after 17 years. A total of 21 failures (11 %) were found in 17 patients. Of these failures, 76 % were attributed to ceramic fractures (62 %) or tooth fractures (14 %). The reasons for the remaining failures were caries (19 %) and endodontic problems (5 %). Restorations of premolars presented a lower failure risk than those of molars. CONCLUSION: The survival rate probability of 88. 7 % after up to 17 years of clinical service for Cerec computer-aided design/computer-assisted machining restorations made of Vita Mk I feldspathic ceramic is regarded as a very respectable clinical outcome...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES This study {{investigated}} the influence of proximal box elevation (PBE) with composite resin when applied to deep proximal defects in root-filled molars with mesio-occluso-distal (MOD) cavities, which were subsequently restored with computer-aided designed/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) ceramic or composite restorations. MATERIALS AND METHOD Root canal treatment was performed on 48 human mandibular molars. Standardized MOD cavities were prepared with the distal box located 2 mm below the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ). The teeth {{were randomly assigned to}} one of four experimental groups (n[*]=[*] 12). In groups G 1 and G 2, the distal proximal box was elevated up to the level of the CEJ with composite resin (PBE). No elevation was performed in the remaining two groups (G 3, G 4). CAD/CAM restorations were fabricated with feldspathic ceramic (Vita Mark II, CER) in groups G 1 (PBE-CER) and G 3 (CER) or with resin nano-ceramic blocks (Lava Ultimate, LAV) in groups G 2 (PBE-LAV) and G 4 (LAV). Replicas were taken before and after thermomechanical loading (TML; 1. 2 Mio cycles; 49 N; 3, 000 thermocycles between 50 °C and 5 °C). Following TML, load was applied until failure. Fracture analysis was performed under a stereomicroscope (× 16). Marginal quality before and after TML (tooth restoration, composite restoration) was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (× 200). RESULTS After TML, lower percentages of continuous margins were observed in groups G 1 -G 3 compared with pre-TML assessments; however, the differences were not statistically significant. For group G 4 -LAV, the marginal quality after TML was significantly better than in any other group. The highest mean fracture value was recorded for group G 4. No significant difference was found for this value between the groups with PBE compared with the groups without PBE, regardless of the material used. The specimens restored with ceramic <b>onlays</b> exhibited fractures that were mainly restricted to the restoration while, in teeth restored with composite <b>onlays,</b> the percentage of catastrophic failures (fractures beyond bone level) was increased. CONCLUSION PBE had no impact on either the marginal integrity or the fracture behavior of root canal-treated mandibular molars restored with feldspathic ceramic <b>onlays.</b> CAD/CAM-fabricated composite <b>onlays</b> were more favorable than ceramic <b>onlays</b> in terms of both marginal quality and fracture resistance, particularly in specimens without PBE. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Composite <b>onlays</b> with or without PBE may be a viable approach for the restoration of root-filled molars with subgingival MOD cavities...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Adhesive luting of {{indirect}} restorations {{can be carried}} out employing dual- or light-curing materials. This in vitro study evaluated the degree of conversion (DC) of the materials employed in this procedure, seeking how the combination of time and power of curing applied during polymerisation, as well as the temperature of the light-curing composite, influenced the DC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty <b>onlays</b> of different thicknesses (2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm) were luted with three different composites: two dual-curing cements (Variolink II and Calibra) and a light-curing composite (Venus). The same halogen lamp was used with three different modalities selected to provide a constant quantity of energy. The time/power combinations tested were 400 mW/cm(2) for 120 s, 800 mW/cm(2) for 60 s and 1200 mW/cm(2) for 40 s. The light-curing composite was employed at room temperature and after preheating at 54 degrees C. Each sample was examined in three positions using the Micro-Raman Dilor HR LabRam spectrometer to evaluate the polymer conversion degree. The data were analysed using analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls test (p= 0. 05). RESULTS: The dual-curing materials showed average conversion percentages close to 64 %, although <b>onlays</b> thickness clearly influence the degree of conversion, the light-curing composite showed satisfactory results only when <b>onlays</b> thickness was thin, however preheating significantly improved the performance of the light-curing composite under <b>onlays</b> of great thickness. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal luting {{of indirect}} restorations is clearly dependent from light source power, irradiation time and dual-cure luting cement or light-curing composite chosen. It should be calibrated for each material to acquire high DCs. Preheating of light-curing only composites allows for the materials to reach optimal conversion degrees...|$|R
