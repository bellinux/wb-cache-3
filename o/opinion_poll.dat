5|$|Williams' {{popularity}} {{increased when}} he fought with then Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin over a campaign promise Martin had made {{that would lead}} to a revised Atlantic Accord. Martin proposed an eight-year deal that the province would keep 100 percent of offshore oil revenues, but with an expenditure a cap to keep the province from surpassing the per capita tax revenue of Ontario. Williams, supported by the other provincial leaders, walked out of talks with Martin, saying that cap would cost the provincial government billions of dollars in lost revenue over the life of its three oil fields.
