5|$|At the {{latitude}} of Incapillo, the Nazca plate subducting beneath the South America plate abruptly shallows towards the south. This shallowing forms the limit between the volcanically active Central Volcanic Zone and the magmatically inactive Pampean flat slab region farther south. This magmatic inactivity <b>occurs</b> <b>because</b> the flat slab removes the asthenospheric wedge.|$|E
5|$|Diaminocarbenes do {{not truly}} dimerise, but rather form the dimer by {{reaction}} via formamidinium salts, a protonated precursor species. Accordingly, this reaction can be acid catalysed. This reaction <b>occurs</b> <b>because</b> unlike imidazolium based carbenes, {{there is no}} loss of aromaticity in protonation of the carbene.|$|E

5|$|The {{exoskeleton}} {{is generally}} blue above, with spots that coalesce, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This <b>occurs</b> <b>because,</b> in life, the red pigment astaxanthin {{is bound to}} a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent to}} which cryovolcanism really occurs is a subject of some debate, as water, being denser than ice by about 8%, has {{difficulty}} erupting under normal circumstances. At Enceladus, it appears that cryovolcanism <b>occurs</b> <b>because</b> water-filled cracks are periodically exposed to vacuum, the cracks being opened and closed by tidal stresses.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in {{the region}} <b>occurs</b> <b>because</b> of the Southern Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone. These contain about 74 volcanoes with post-glacial activity; they include both monogenetic volcanoes, stratovolcanoes and {{volcanic}} complexes. Llaima and Villarrica {{are among the most}} active of these volcanoes. The Southern and Austral volcanic zones are separated by a gap without volcanic activity, close to the Chile Triple Junction.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current {{at one point in the}} material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This <b>occurs</b> <b>because</b> electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E
5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility <b>occurs</b> <b>because</b> melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E
5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis <b>occurs</b> <b>because</b> many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

5|$|It has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Cfa {{according to the}} Köppen climate classification). whose main features are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year. This year-round rainfall <b>occurs</b> <b>because</b> most of the region lies north of the subtropical high pressure belt even in winter, exposing it to moist easterly winds from the Atlantic Ocean throughout the year. Water deficiencies and extended periods of drought are uncommon, {{and much of the}} region has a positive water balance (i.e. the precipitation exceeds the potential evapotranspiration).|$|E
5|$|The human ear can {{generally}} hear sounds with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz (the audio range). Sounds {{outside this}} range are considered infrasound (below 20Hz) or ultrasound (above 20kHz) Although hearing requires an intact and functioning auditory {{portion of the}} central nervous system as well as a working ear, human deafness (extreme insensitivity to sound) most commonly <b>occurs</b> <b>because</b> of abnormalities of the inner ear, rather than in the nerves or tracts of the central auditory system.|$|E
5|$|The low-lying damp ground {{can produce}} a visual effect known as a Fata Morgana when the Tor appears to rise out of the mist. This optical {{phenomenon}} <b>occurs</b> <b>because</b> rays of light are strongly bent when they pass through air layers of different temperatures in a steep thermal inversion where an atmospheric duct has formed.

5|$|This basin’s {{season has}} a double peak: one in April and May, before {{the onset of}} the monsoon, and another in October and November, just after. This double peak <b>occurs</b> <b>because</b> {{powerful}} vertical wind shear in between the surface monsoonal low and upper tropospheric high during the monsoon season tears apart incipient cyclones. High shear explains why no cyclones can form in the Red Sea, which possesses the necessary depth, vorticity and surface temperatures year-round. Rarely do tropical cyclones that form elsewhere in this basin affect the Arabian Peninsula or Somalia; however, Cyclone Gonu caused heavy damage in Oman on the peninsula in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Two {{chains of}} DNA twist {{around each other}} to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar {{backbone}} spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine. The specificity of base pairing <b>occurs</b> <b>because</b> adenine and thymine align to form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.|$|E

5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations. These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This <b>occurs</b> <b>because</b> of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.|$|E
5|$|Calcium {{is a very}} ductile silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose {{properties}} {{are very similar to}} the heavier elements in its group, strontium, barium, and radium. A calcium atom has twenty electrons, arranged in the electron configuration 4s2. Like the other elements placed in group 2 of the periodic table, calcium has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital, which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a dipositive ion with the stable electron configuration of a noble gas, in this case argon. Hence, calcium is almost always divalent in its compounds, which are usually ionic. Hypothetical univalent salts of calcium would be stable with respect to their elements, but not to disproportionation to the divalent salts and calcium metal, because the enthalpy of formation of MX2 is much higher than those of the hypothetical MX. This <b>occurs</b> <b>because</b> of the much greater lattice energy afforded by the more highly charged Ca2+ cation compared to the hypothetical Ca+ cation.|$|E
5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This <b>occurs</b> <b>because</b> of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E
