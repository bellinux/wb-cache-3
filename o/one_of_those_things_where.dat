Stone said, [...] "We didn't want to make an episode where it was like, 'Oh, those Wall Street guys took our money.' It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> we all screwed up and nobody really knows what's going on, but {{it has something to do}} with buying shit like Margaritavilles." [...] The Margaritaville also serves {{as a metaphor for}} the housing bubble. Parker himself actually owns a Margaritaville, of which he said, [...] "It's pretty stupid because it really is just a blender".|$|E

On July 3, when the rosters for the 2011 MLB All-Star Game in Phoenix, Arizona were broadcast on TBS, it was announced that Hamels was voted onto the National League team along with fellow pitchers and teammates Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, Plácido Polanco, and Shane Victorino. He was not eligible to play, however, because he had pitched the Sunday prior to the All-Star Game. Hamels shared his dismay with this rule, saying, [...] "It's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> people who don't play the game make the rules." ...|$|E

Water continued, [...] "it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> to see it, it just gets you. But we had to ask ourselves, does it help our story? No." [...] Footage that was nearly edited out included a scene where Anwar had to siphon petrol out of the family car for the house's generator. Anwar explained to the camera that he needed to do it because their family was so poor. [...] "That's tough", commented Water, [...] "because that's a dishonour to his family." ...|$|E

He was a string player as well so it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> it felt like he would want me to go and just do this." [...] Around the same period, Yorke announced his separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. He told Rolling Stone: [...] "There was a lot of difficult stuff going on at the time, and it was a tough time for us as people. It was a miracle that that record got made at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamels started Game 2 of the 2009 National League Division Series {{against the}} Colorado Rockies, {{allowing}} four earned runs through five innings {{to take the}} loss. Nevertheless, the Phillies won the series, three games to one. He earned the win in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series as the Phillies beat the Dodgers, 8–6. Hamels started Game 3 of the World Series against the New York Yankees, pitching [...] innings, allowing 5 earned runs and taking the loss as the Yankees won that game 8-5. Afterward, he told reporters, [...] "I can't wait for it (the season) to end. It's been mentally draining. It's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where,</b> a year in, you just can’t wait for a fresh start." [...] Later in the series, after the Phillies won game five, a confrontational Brett Myers mockingly asked Hamels: [...] "What are you doing here? I thought you quit." [...] The Phillies lost the World Series to the New York Yankees in six games.|$|E
500|$|The {{biological}} father of Superman. Sean Penn and Clive Owen were also {{considered for the}} role.

That's the question that Jor-El faces, that's the situation that he's in." [...] Crowe also comments on his preparation for the film stating that: [...] "When I signed on... well, one, I didn't realize that I would be wearing Spandex—'cause you know that's Superman's costume—I didn't realize that I'd have to fit into it as well," [...] Crowe said. [...] "But, I also didn't realize the type of organizer that Zack Snyder is, 'cause this was really old school prep. This is sort of David Lean-level preparation, and I really appreciated him.

500|$|The album {{marked a}} {{departure}} in Fall Out Boy's sound {{in which the}} band implemented a diverse array of musical styles. As reported by Billboard, Fall Out Boy [...] "drifts further from its hardcore punk roots to write increasingly accessible pop tunes," [...] a slight departure from the group's previous more pop punk sound. Infinity on High {{has been compared to}} the work of pop punk bands such as Green Day, with Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times commenting, [...] "Whatever snot and feedback courses through these songs, sweetness always triumphs, carried forth by bubblegum bass lines, snappy drums and tunes as comforting as lullabies." [...] Stump explained that the album contains a variety of different moods: [...] "It’s <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> you get older as a band and you do your own thing...The older Fall Out Boy elements, from the early records, are definitely there, and this album is an extension of that." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Neil Gaiman. After Steven Moffat {{replaced}} Russell T Davies as the showrunner of Doctor Who, being a fan of Gaiman's blog, Moffat met with Gaiman and Gaiman had asked to write an episode. In an interview Gaiman stated [...] "I came {{up with something that}} was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> you thought that nobody's done that before." [...] The episode was originally titled [...] "The House of Nothing" [...] before Gaiman sat down to write it, but that was changed to [...] "Bigger on the Inside". This title remained until about six weeks before the episode aired, but the crew was beginning to worry that [...] "Bigger on the Inside" [...] would give away the surprise that Idris was the TARDIS, so it was changed. [...] "The Doctor's Wife" [...] was also a fake title attached to the 1984 serial The Caves of Androzani; then-producer John Nathan-Turner had changed the title to that on his planning board in an attempt to weed out a suspected leak in his office.|$|E
500|$|Michael Giacchino, Abrams' most {{frequent}} collaborator, composed {{the music for}} Star Trek. He kept the original theme by Alexander Courage for the end credits, which Abrams said symbolized {{the momentum of the}} crew coming together. Giacchino admitted personal pressure in scoring the film, as [...] "I grew up listening to all of that great [...] music, and that's part of what inspired me to do what I'm doing [...] You just go in scared. You just hope you do your best. It's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> the film will tell me what to do." [...] Scoring took place at the Sony Scoring Stage with a 107-piece orchestra and 40-person choir. An erhu, performed by Karen Han, was used for the Vulcan themes. A distorted recording was used for the Romulans. Varèse Sarabande, the record label responsible for releasing albums of Giacchino's previous scores for Alias, Lost, , and Speed Racer, released the soundtrack for the film on May 5. The music for the theatrical trailers were composed by Two Steps from Hell.|$|E

It's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where,</b> hopefully, the audience will suspend disbelief a little bit." [...] The controversy was poorly received by critics as well. Film critic Roger Ebert was one of the critical voices against the casting. When asked about casting a white cast to portray the characters, he said, [...] "The original series Avatar: The Last Airbender was highly regarded and popular for three seasons on Nickelodeon. Its fans take it for granted that its heroes are Asian. Why would Paramount and Shyamalan {{go out of their way}} to offend these fans? There are many young Asian actors capable of playing the parts." [...] Jevon Phillips of the Los Angeles Times noted that despite Shyamalan's attempts to defuse the situation, [...] "this is definitely not an issue that will fade away or be overlooked" [...] and that this film exemplifies the need for a debate within Hollywood about racial diversity in its films.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the members {{consider}} Believer a [...] "Christian band" [...] Daub replies {{in an interview with}} Metal Covenant in 2009: [...] "Well, yes, and no... this is a difficult subject to approach for us. Ever since we formed Believer, Kurt Bachman and myself despised being limited to a certain belief or style of music. We did not like to be labeled or numbered. Whether it was our personal spiritual journey, or the type of music we played. We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. The key focus for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves." [...] Daub comments about the lyrics that [...] "We always wrote about what was near and dear to our heart. On Extraction, we used Bible based themes and stories to express our intentions, but {{we did not want to}} preach." [...] "Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [...] It was one of these things where it got out of control. With promoting records it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> the record company was like “Hey, here’s a slant. Something different. [...] Something new and unique. Let’s go for that”. I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”. You get labeled and we’re going to have to go through labels but we’re not really comfortable with any." [...] says Bachman in an interview on MetalSucks.|$|E

On March 16, 2011, it was announced that Jennifer Lawrence (who was at the time filming for [...] ) had landed the coveted role. Ross described Lawrence as having [...] "an incredible amount of self-assuredness, you got the sense that this girl knew exactly who she was.

But it also has a fantastic message. Many people refer to the lines 'like the 4th of July; however the original lyrics were 'like a firefly' as they reminded me of fireworks at night whenever I saw them. However the trend caught on and in live performances I now sing 4th of July, which happens to make great sense for the song name." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band's first {{performance}} in 2005 {{was at the}} Live 8 concert, Barrie, Ontario on July 2 where the song [...] "Where Are You" [...] was premiered in its final form. For this tour they were accompanied by guitarist Joel Shearer of the band Pedestrian. Leading up to the album's release, they toured several small clubs in the Los Angeles area [...] "to work the bugs out" [...] and help the band get a better feel for the songs. They then toured steadily across North America, opening two shows for The Rolling Stones, until October when a family member of a band member became ill and several shows had to be canceled. The band chose to play smaller venues on this tour rather than arenas because the sound quality was better. [...] "And for us, this new record is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> <b>where</b> {{there are a lot}} of little guitar parts happening all over the place and little textures -- and we want to hear that stuff." [...] A cross-Canadian tour continued through summer of 2006 with the final show being played at Rogers Centre in Toronto.
