5|$|Another {{transitional}} {{feature of}} Dimetrodon is a ridge {{in the back}} of the jaw called the reflected lamina. The reflected lamina is found on the articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the jaw joint while the articular developed into the malleus bone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> The reflected lamina became part of a ring called the tympanic annulus that supports the ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E
5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and {{is connected to the}} throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E

5000|$|Land {{vertebrates}} evolved <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> independently in each major lineage, and {{are this}} <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> parallel evolution. <b>The</b> configurations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> monotreme and therian mammals {{can thus be}} interpreted as convergent evolution or homoplasy. Thus evidence from fossils demonstrate homoplasies for <b>the</b> detachment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ear from the jaw. Furthermore, {{it is apparent that}} the land-based eardrum, or tympanic membrane, and connecting structures such as the Eustachian tube evolved convergently in multiple different settings as opposed to being a defining morphology.|$|R
5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features. These {{studies have shown that}} evolution can alter development to produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{three-dimensional}} geometric model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> can {{be constructed}} in a computer-aided design environment with acute geometry and microanatomy.

50|$|Ordinarily, when {{sound waves}} in air strike liquid, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy is {{reflected}} off <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid. <b>The</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> allows <b>the</b> impedance matching <b>of</b> sound traveling in air to acoustic waves traveling {{in a system}} of fluids and membranes in the inner ear.

5000|$|Soon {{after he}} began his practice, his father began {{referring}} him opera colleagues with vocal problems.

25|$|Middle ear {{myoclonus}} {{occurs in}} the muscles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> These muscles may include the tensor tympani and stapedius muscles.

Sufferers describe it as a thumping sound or sensation in the ear.|$|E
25|$|Water has {{different}} acoustic properties to air. Sound from an underwater source can propagate relatively freely through body tissues {{where there is}} contact with the water as the acoustic properties are similar.

25|$|This {{bypassing}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> {{also affects}} the frequency {{sensitivity of the}} ear. Sound is also reflected {{in proportion to the}} change of density or elasticity (mismatch of acoustic impedance) when passing through an interface, so that enclosing the head in a rigid helmet may cause a significant attenuation of sound originating in the water. Internal sound attenuation material my further reduce noise levels.|$|E

25|$|Cefalexin {{can treat}} certain {{bacterial}} infections, including those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear,</b> bone and joint, skin, and urinary tract.

Cefalexin is not effective against infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus, or Pseudomonas. Like other antibiotics, cefalexin cannot treat viral infections, such as the flu, common cold or acute bronchitis. Cefalexin can be used in those who have mild or moderate allergies to penicillin.

25|$|Hyenas {{originated}} in the jungles of Miocene Eurasia 22 million years ago, when most early feliform species were still largely arboreal. The first ancestral hyenas were likely similar to the modern banded palm civet; {{one of the earliest}} hyena species described, Plioviverrops, was a lithe, civet-like animal that inhabited Eurasia 20–22 million years ago, and is identifiable as a hyaenid by the structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> and dentition. The lineage of Plioviverrops prospered, and gave rise to descendants with longer legs and more pointed jaws, a direction similar to that taken by canids in North America.|$|E
25|$|In reptiles, {{sound is}} {{transmitted}} to the inner ear by the stapes (stirrup) bone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> This is pressed against the oval window, a membrane-covered opening {{on the surface of}} the vestibule. From here, sound waves are conducted through a short perilymphatic duct to a second opening, the round window, which equalizes pressure, allowing the incompressible fluid to move freely. Running parallel with the perilymphatic duct is a separate blind-ending duct, the lagena, filled with endolymph. The lagena is separated from the perilymphatic duct by a basilar membrane, and contains the sensory hair cells that finally translate the vibrations in the fluid into nerve signals. It is attached at one end to the saccule.|$|E
25|$|Contracting muscles produce {{vibration}} and sound. Slow twitch fibers produce 10 to 30 contractions {{per second}} (equivalent to 10 to 30Hz sound frequency). Fast twitch fibers produce 30 to 70 contractions per second (equivalent to 30 to 70Hz sound frequency). The vibration can be witnessed and felt by highly tensing one's muscles, as when making a firm fist. The sound {{can be heard}} by pressing a highly tensed muscle against the ear, again a firm fist is a good example. The sound is usually described as a rumbling sound. Some individuals can voluntarily produce this rumbling sound by contracting the tensor tympani muscle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> The rumbling sound can also be heard when the neck or jaw muscles are highly tensed as when yawning deeply.|$|E
40|$|Pneumococcal {{otitis media}} is {{associated}} with <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> potent in¯ammatory me-diators (leukotrienes), but the mechanism by which pneumococcus induces production <b>of</b> leukotrienes in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> is poorly understood. In this study, up-regulation of 2 genes that govern the lipoxygenase pathway, cPLA 2 and 5 -LOX, was observed in rats following inoculation <b>of</b> pneumococcus into <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> cavity. Expression <b>of</b> cPLA 2 was low, and 5 -LOX gene expression was not detected in control animals. Up-regulation of cPLA 2 and 5 -LOX in <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> epithelial cells was accompanied by an increase of high-molecular-weight glycoproteins in <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> ¯uid and cells. These ®ndings suggest that pneumococcus activates the lipoxygenase pathway by up-regulating expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cPLA 2 and 5 -LOX genes.
