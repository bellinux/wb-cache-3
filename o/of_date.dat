40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between personality and the recognition <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> DV in female university students. The structured sentence completion test (K-SCT) was used as the measurement of personality. The study surveyed 32 female university students. The results indicated that the relation between personality and recognition <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> DV was not observed. Thus, it was suggested that there are no associations between personality and types <b>of</b> victims <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> DV. In addition, an association between the recognition <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> DV and 2 ̆ 2 attack 2 ̆ 2 was observed. Subjects who were ambivalent indicated in a higher risk <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> DV than subjects who were positive against attack. The results indicated that subjects who are ambivalent have mixed positive and negative feelings, and this leads to a conflict against attack. Thus, there was no relation between personality and recognition <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> DV found herein, but personality was related to attack. Therefore, these findings can be applied to future prevention education <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> DV...|$|R

One day, Nakai Baisei (a {{friend of the}} family {{who was a member of}} the shogun's guard), {{mentioned}} that jūjutsu was an excellent form of physical training. He showed Kanō a few techniques by which a smaller man might overcome a larger and stronger opponent. Kanō decided he wanted to learn the art despite Nakai's insistence that such training was out <b>of</b> <b>date</b> and somewhat dangerous.

5|$|Despite the {{destruction}} of the Armada, the Spanish threat continued; the castles in Kent were kept ready for action throughout the rest of Elizabeth's reign. In 1596 a Spanish invasion fleet carrying reportedly 20,000 soldiers set out for Pendennis, which was then garrisoned with only 500 men. The fleet was forced to turn back due to bad weather, but Elizabeth reviewed the defences and significantly expanded Henry's original fortifications with more up-to-date bastions, designed by the engineer Paul Ive. By the end of the century, however, most of the Device Forts were typically out <b>of</b> <b>date</b> by European standards.|$|E

Linear regression models were conducted to identify the most salient predictors of the tolerance <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence. A general/combined model was examined as well as three subtype-specific models (e. g. psychological, physical and sexual dating violence). A total of seven predictor variables were entered into each model in three blocks: sociodemographic variables were entered first, followed by sex and then gender-related constructs (e. g. rape myth acceptance, power in relationships, the acceptability and seriousness <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence). The results identify a number of variables {{that are associated with}} the tolerance <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence scales and some that led to a decrease in scores on these scales. Findings suggest that the link between gender-related constructs and the tolerance <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence is complex and multidimensional and warrants further research to explain the variation observed...|$|R

5|$|Airport {{security}} was introduced on 1 January 2005. This put a large {{strain on the}} terminal capacity and the terminal had to be expanded.

As the first airport in the world, Brønnøysund received SCAT-I, a satellite-based landing system, on 29 October 2007. The new terminal opened on 26 May 2008, which allowed the a restaurant to open at the airport, all vehicles to be stored indoors and included a new helicopter terminal.

A contract for this type of radar had already been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding had already gone a step further and devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields.

40|$|This study empirically {{evaluates the}} Riggs and O’Leary (1989) model <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence. A sample of 200 college {{students}} completes assessments concerning {{the occurrence of}} violence in their dating relationships. The inci-dence of self-reported partner violence is 25 % for women and 10 % for men. Multivariate logistic regression analyses are performed to determine the most salient predictors <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence for each gender. Findings reveal that the model is more accurate in predicting female, as compared with male perpe-tration <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence. The model accurately classifies 83 % of violent women and only 30 % of violent men. This study has several implications for the field <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence. Results indicate that although there is some degree of overlap, variant constructs predict violence for each gender. Identifying these constructs will guide prevention efforts in more effectively decreasing the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence...|$|R

Therefore, the purpose of this research was to examine emotion regulation and alcohol use in the context <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> aggression to determine if alcohol use mediates the relationship between emotion regulation and perpetration <b>of</b> <b>dating</b> violence amongst females. Participants (N= 379) completed a series of online questionnaires about emotion regulation, patterns of alcohol use, and perpetration of physical and psychological aggression in their dating relationships. The results suggested that full mediation of alcohol use for psychological aggression, and partial mediation for physical perpetration.

Saldías pointed out that, since there was no act of foundation of Pichilemu nor record <b>of</b> <b>date</b> of the first inhabitation of the area by the Promaucaes, the date of 24 January 1544, specified in the title of encomienda of Topocalma given by Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia to Juan Gómez de Almagro, another conquistador, was the most correct date to be used to commemorate the anniversary of Pichilemu. The current territory of Pichilemu was part of the encomienda of Topocalma.|$|E

The garrison at Walmer remained substantial during the period, with a governor, a corporal and 20 soldiers, but when Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 he reduced the numbers again to a captain, lieutenant, porter and 16 men. In the Glorious Revolution of 1688 against Charles' brother, King James II, the townsfolk of Deal seized Walmer Castle on behalf of William III, the Prince of Orange.

5|$|In 1991, {{the down}} became {{the site of}} a major road protest against the {{completion}} of a section of the M3 motorway from London to the south coast of England. There had been plans since the 1970s to replace an earlier 1930s-built bypass of Winchester, which became regularly congested due to design features that had become out <b>of</b> <b>date.</b> This became problematic {{due to the lack of}} available land between Winchester College and St. Catherine's Hill. After several public inquiries, particularly with problems using the water meadows near the college, a route was chosen that took the motorway over the down, ultimately in a cutting. Although protesting against the M3 had been ongoing since the early 1970s, the protest-action on top of the down, described in 1994 as the most controversial British motorway project ever to start construction, attracted a wider group of classes of people than had previously been the case, and included physical violence from onsite security officers.|$|E

They reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out <b>of</b> <b>date</b> and inadequate; Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings; the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed; and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a danger area at too high a speed.

Four hundred and thirty-three heterosexual, unmarried, undergraduate women and 108 heterosexual, unmarried, undergraduate men between the ages of 18 and 22 completed the study.
