2500|$|Civilian use is {{permitted}} on land, but {{use of the}} unmodified flag at sea is restricted to military vessels. Unauthorised use of the flag in the 17th century to avoid paying harbour duties– a privilege restricted to naval ships– caused James's successor, Charles I, to order that use of the flag on naval vessels be restricted to His Majesty's ships [...] "upon pain of <b>Our</b> <b>high</b> displeasure." [...] It remains a criminal offence under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 to display the Union Flag (other than the [...] "pilot jack"– see below) from a British ship. Naval ships will fly the white ensign, merchant and private boats can fly the red ensign, others with special permission such as naval yacht clubs can fly the blue ensign.

2500|$|Seventh-day Adventists {{believe that}} texts such as Hebrews 8:1-2 teach that the two-compartment {{design of the}} earthly {{sanctuary}} built by Moses, {{was in fact a}} model patterned after the Heavenly Sanctuary [...] "which the Lord pitched not man" [...] Hebrews 8:2 (NASB). They believe that statements in Hebrews 7:17-28 as well as statements found in Hebrews chapters 8 and 9, reveal that Christ entered the first phase of His Heavenly ministry (in the Holy Place of the Heavenly Sanctuary) as <b>our</b> <b>High</b> Priest after His bodily resurrection and ascension into heaven. According to this view the 2300 days (years) found in Daniel 8:13-14 point to the date when Christ's Most Holy Place ministry in Heaven would start. This is the event typified by the Day of Atonement described in Leviticus 16 and in Levitcus 23:26-32. The Investigative Judgment doctrine states that in 1844 Christ moved from the Holy Place to the Most Holy Place in heaven as described in Daniel 7:13-14, and that this began the judgment described in Daniel 7:9-10.|$|E
