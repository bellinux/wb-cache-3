30|$|The {{western part}} of Germany saw {{unification}} much less as a national undertaking. After the Second World War, the Federal Republic of Germany had virtually given up on thinking in national terms. Terms such as nationalism and national interests had a negative connotation.

However, the film was produced by a consortium <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>interests,</b> with an international cast and crew that could not speak to each other. In addition, the script needed to be rewritten by Laurel to make it fit the comedy team's style, and both suffered serious physical illness during the filming.|$|R

25|$|Even {{prior to}} the {{penetration}} <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>interests,</b> Southeast Asia was {{a critical part of}} the world trading system. A wide range of commodities originated in the region, but especially important were spices such as pepper, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg. The spice trade initially was developed by Indian and Arab merchants, but it also brought Europeans to the region. First Spaniards (Manila galleon) and Portuguese, then the Dutch, and finally the British and French became involved in this enterprise in various countries. The penetration <b>of</b> <b>European</b> commercial <b>interests</b> gradually evolved into annexation of territories, as traders lobbied for an extension of control to protect and expand their activities. As a result, the Dutch moved into Indonesia, the British into Malaya and parts of Borneo, the French into Indochina, and the Spanish and the US into the Philippines. An economic effect of this imperialism was the shift in the production of commodities. For example, the rubber plantations of Malaysia, Java, Vietnam and Cambodia, the tin mining of Malaya, the rice fields of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and Irrawaddy River delta in Burma, were a response to powerful market demands.|$|R

Despite winning the first leg at home, a 2-0 defeat in the return meant the end <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>interest</b> at the same stage for another season.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{an article}} in the Houston Chronicle, critics also worried that Abacus might {{undermine}} the position of the US [...] "as a safe harbor for the world's investors" [...] and that [...] "The involvement <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>interests</b> as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that region's political leaders, most notably British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who has accused Goldman of [...] "moral bankruptcy". This is, in short, a big global story ... Is what Goldman Sachs did with its Abacus investment vehicle illegal? That will be for the courts to decide, ... But it doesn't take a judge and jury to conclude that, legalities aside, this was just wrong." ...|$|R

5000|$|From the mid-17th century onwards, {{there are}} {{numerous}} vivid eyewitness accounts of the production of steel by European travellers to the Indian subcontinent.

Voysey in 1832.The 18th, 19th and early 20th century saw a heady period <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>interest</b> in {{trying to understand the}} nature and properties of wootz steel. Indian wootz engaged the attention of some of the best-known scientists. One was Michael Faraday who was fascinated by wootz steel. It was probably the investigations of George Pearson in 1795 reported at the Royal Society, which had the most far-reaching impact in terms of kindling interest in wootz amongst European scientists. He was the first of these scientists to publish his results and, incidentally, the first to use the word [...] "wootz" [...] in print.|$|E

50|$|During {{the latter}} part of the nineteenth century, the impulse towards {{autonomy}} which was felt by some of the propertied and educated elites was frustrated by international, political and economic circumstances outside their control. The production of sugar from cane continued to dominate the Caribbean economies, with oil, minerals and tourism becoming important items in the twentieth century. The influx of American capital and the gradual diminution <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>interests</b> in the Caribbean led to the expansion of American influence in the region from the turn of the century onwards, notably in Cuba, Haiti and Santo Domingo. This was the context in which the movements for self-determination worked, complicated everywhere by racial prejudice and disparities in the ownership of property.|$|R
