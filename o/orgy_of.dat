5|$|Always {{in need of}} funds, Raynald urged Manuel to {{send the}} promised subsidy to him, but Manuel failed to pay the money. Raynald made an {{alliance}} with Thoros II of Cilicia. They attacked Cyprus, subjecting the Byzantine island to a three-week <b>orgy</b> <b>of</b> violence in early 1156. They only left Cyprus on the rumour of an imperial fleet approaching the island, but only after they had forced all Cypriots to ransom themselves, {{with the exception of}} the wealthiest individuals (including Emperor Manuel's nephew, John Doukas Komnenos), whom they carried off to Antioch. Cyprus would never entirely recover from the devastation that Raynald's and Thoros's marauding raid caused.|$|E
5|$|Once {{rebuilding}} began, {{the poor}} rebuilt their basic {{housing in the}} same primitive fashion as before. By contrast, the wealthiest residents, both secular and spiritual, became caught in an almost manic <b>orgy</b> <b>of</b> building. Most members of the nobility had several homes in Sicily. For one thing, the Spanish viceroy spent {{six months of the}} year in Palermo and six in Catania, holding court in each city, and hence members of the aristocracy needed a town palazzo in each city. Once the palazzi in devastated Catania were rebuilt in the new fashion, the palazzi in Palermo seemed antiquated by comparison, so they too were eventually rebuilt. Following this, from the middle of the 18th century, villas to retire to in the autumn, essentially status symbols, were built at the fashionable enclave at Bagheria. This pattern was repeated, on a smaller scale, throughout the lesser cities of Sicily, each city providing a more entertaining social life and a magnetic draw for the provincial aristocrat than their country estate. The country estate also did not escape the building mania. Often Baroque wings or new façades were added to ancient castles, or country villas were completely rebuilt. Thus the frenzy of building gained momentum until the increasingly fantastical Baroque architecture demanded by these hedonistic patrons reached its zenith in the mid-18th century.|$|E

25|$|The {{consequences}} {{for the people of}} Liverpool were far greater than those in the capital. Left without an effective police presence, public order in some areas broke down and resulted in what the Liverpool Daily Post (4 August 1918) called 'an <b>orgy</b> <b>of</b> looting and rioting'. This continued for three or four days before the military, aided by non-striking police, brought the situation under control, but at the cost of several lives and more than 200 arrests for looting.|$|E

25|$|Several {{countries}} charged Italian studios with {{exceeding the}} boundaries of acceptability with their late-1970s Nazi exploitation films, inspired by American movies such as Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS. The Italian works included the notorious but comparatively tame SS Experiment Camp and the far more graphic Last <b>Orgy</b> <b>of</b> the Third Reich (Italian: L'ultima orgia del III Reich). These films showed, in great detail, sexual crimes against prisoners at concentration camps. These films may still be banned in the United Kingdom and other countries.|$|E

25|$|According to {{researcher}} and author Krisztián Ungváry, some 38,000 {{civilians were killed}} during the Siege of Budapest: about 13,000 from military action and 25,000 from starvation, disease and other causes.

When the Soviets finally claimed victory, they initiated an <b>orgy</b> <b>of</b> violence, including the wholesale theft of anything they could lay their hands on, random executions and mass rape. An estimated 50,000 women and girls were raped, although estimates vary from 5,000 to 200,000.

25|$|In 1963, Wood {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} for Shotgun Wedding, an exploitation film about hillbillies marrying child brides, and Wood's transitional film, once again combining two genres, horror and grindhouse skin-flick, was 1965's <b>Orgy</b> <b>of</b> the Dead, originally titled Nudie Ghoulies. Wood handled various production details while Stephen C. Apostolof directed under the pseudonym A. C. Stephen. The film {{begins with a}} re-creation of the opening scene from the then-unreleased Night of the Ghouls. Criswell, wearing one of Lugosi's old capes, rises from his coffin to deliver an introduction taken almost word-for-word from the previous film. Set in a misty graveyard, the Lord of the Dead (Criswell) and his sexy consort, the Black Ghoul (a Vampira look-alike), preside over a series of macabre performances by topless dancers from beyond the grave (recruited by Wood from local strip clubs). The film also features a Wolf Man and a Mummy. Together, Wood and Apostolof went on to make a string of sexploitation films up to 1977. Wood co-wrote the screenplays and occasionally acted. Venus Flytrap (1970), a US/Japan horror film, {{was based on an}} unproduced Wood screenplay from the 1950s.|$|E
