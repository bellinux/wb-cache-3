50|$|<b>Ololiuqui</b> (Coatl xoxouhqui) was {{identified}} as Rivea corymbosa in 1941 by Richard Evans Schultes. The name <b>Ololiuqui</b> refers to the brown seeds of the Rivea corymbosa (Morning Glory) plant.Tlitliltzin {{was identified}} later as being Ipomoea violacea by R. Gordon Wasson. This variation contains black seeds and usually has bluish hued flowers.|$|E

50|$|Known to {{natives of}} north and central Mexico by its Nahuatl name <b>Ololiúqui</b> (also spelled ololiuhqui or <b>ololiuqui)</b> and by the south eastern natives as xtabentún (in Mayan), it is a {{perennial}} climbing vine with white flowers, often planted as an ornamental plant. This plant also occurs in Cuba, where it usually blooms from early December to February. Its flowers secrete copious amount of nectar, and the honey the bees make from it is very clear and aromatic. It {{is considered one of}} the main honey plants from the island.|$|E

50|$|The ancient Aztecs {{employed}} {{a variety of}} entheogenic plants and animals within their society. The various species have been identified through their depiction on murals, vases, and other objects. The plants used include <b>ololiuqui</b> (Rivea corymbosa), teonanácatl (Psilocybe spp.), sinicuichi (Heimia salicifolia), toloatzin (Datura spp.), peyotl (Lophophora williamsii) and many others.|$|E
50|$|The {{morning glory}} was also {{utilized}} in healing rituals by the ticitl. The ticitl would often take <b>ololiuqui</b> {{to determine the}} cause of diseases and illness. It was also used as an anesthetic to ease pain by creating a paste from the seeds and tobacco leaf, then rubbing it on the affected body part.|$|E
50|$|Known to the Aztecs as <b>ololiuqui,</b> {{varieties}} of morning glory including Turbina corymbosa and Ipomoea tricolor, are also {{thought to have}} been used by the Maya under the name xtabentún (thought by some to be the origin of Xtabentún liqueur). Their seeds contain ergine, or d-lysergic acid amide, which is related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). When consumed, it is reported to give powerful hallucinogenic visions, even when only consuming small doses.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, a 16th-century [...] Aztec statue of Xochipilli was {{unearthed}} {{on the side}} of the volcano Popocatépetl near Tlalmanalco. The statue is of a single figure seated upon a temple-like base. Both the statue and the base upon which it sits are covered in carvings of sacred and psychoactive organisms including mushrooms (Psilocybe aztecorum), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), <b>Ololiúqui</b> (Turbina corymbosa), sinicuichi (Heimia salicifolia), possibly cacahuaxochitl (Quararibea funebris), and one unidentified flower.|$|E
5000|$|R. Gordon Wasson has {{posited that}} the plant known as pipiltzintzintli is in fact Salvia divinorum. It's not entirely known {{whether or not this}} plant was used by the Aztecs as a psychotropic, but Jonathan Ott (1996) argues that {{although}} there are competing species for the identification of pipiltzintzintli, Salvia divinorum is probably the [...] "best bet." [...] There are references to use of pipiltzintzintli in Spanish arrest records from the conquest, as well as a reference to the mixing of <b>ololiuqui</b> with pipiltzintzintli.|$|E
5000|$|The Aztec entheogenic {{complex is}} {{extremely}} well documented. Through historical evidence, there {{is proof that}} the Aztecs used several forms of psychoactive drugs. These drugs include <b>Ololiuqui</b> (the seed of Rivea corymbosa), Teonanácatl (translated as “mushroom of the gods," [...] a psilocybe mushroom) and sinicuichi (a flower added to drinks). The Xochipilli statue, according to R.G. Wasson, gives the identity of several entheogenic plants. Other evidence for entheogenic use of the Aztecs comes from the Florentine Codex, a series of 12 books vividly describing the Aztec culture and society, {{including the use of}} entheogenic drugs.|$|E
50|$|Reko's {{book also}} covered the {{following}} drugs, {{many of which}} were not mentioned in the earlier book Phantastica by Louis Lewin: sinicuichi (Heimia spp.) for which he falsely claimed psychoactivity, <b>Ololiúqui</b> (Turbina corymbosa), peyotl (Lophophora williamsii), marihuana (Cannabis sativa), toloachi (Datura stramonium var. tatula), ayahuasca, colorines (Erythrina and Sophora species), coztic-zapote (Pouteria campechiana), xomil-xihuite (Gelsemium sempervirens), camotillo (Dioscorea composita), and cohombrillo (Ecballium elaterium). The second edition also contained chicalote (supposedly obtained from a cross between Argemone mexicana and Papaver somniferum), minapatli (Sebastiania pavoniana, Mexican jumping bean), and herbas locas (Dioon edule, Astragalus amphyoxys, and Oxytropis lambertii).|$|E
5000|$|On {{entering}} Harvard in 1933, Schultes initially {{planned to}} pursue medicine. However that direction changed {{after he took}} Biology 104, [...] "Plants and Human Affairs," [...] taught by orchidologist and Director of the Harvard Botanical Museum Oakes Ames. Ames became a mentor, and Schultes became an assistant in the Botanical Museum; his undergraduate senior thesis studied the ritual use of peyote cactus among the Kiowa of Oklahoma, and he obtained BA in Biology in 1937. Continuing at Harvard {{as a graduate student}} under Ames, he completed his Master of Arts in Biology in 1938 and his Ph.D. in Botany in 1941. Schultes's doctoral thesis investigated the lost identity of the Mexican hallucinogenic plants teonanácatl (various mushrooms belonging to the Psilocybe genus) and <b>ololiuqui</b> (a morning glory species) in Oaxaca, Mexico. [...] He received a fellowship from the National Research Council to study the plants used to make curare.|$|E
40|$|General Description. —Christmas vine, {{also known}} as Christmas wreath, aguinaldo blanco, corona de novia, <b>ololiuqui,</b> and badoh, is a woody vine that may extend 5 m or more {{laterally}} and into the crowns of trees and shrubs. Older stems reach about 2. 5 cm in diameter. The gray, threesided stems have many lenticels and may be grooved. The young stems are cylindrical and tough. The foliage is concentrated on current year’s growth. The leaves, with slender petioles, have cordate blades 5 to 8 cm long with an elongated point. The inflorescences are corymbose cymes that arise from leaf axils. The 2. 5 - to 3 -cm corolla is trumpet shaped, white with a red or purple throat and green or greenish gray radiating stripes. The ellipsoidal capsule has three long and three short sepals that cause it to spin and glide laterally when released. Each capsule contains one brown, pubescent seed (Acevedo-Rodríguez an...|$|E
