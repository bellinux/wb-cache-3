5|$|Married and bisexual, Chatwin {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{prominent}} men in Great Britain known to have contracted HIV and to have died of an AIDS-related illness, although he hid the details. Following his death, some members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> community criticised Chatwin for keeping his diagnosis secret.|$|E
5|$|While echoing {{criticism}} about {{the exclusion of}} lesbian concerns and the distortions contained in the broadcast, Browning went on to note that sexual freedom has always been part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> male agenda {{and that it would}} be absurd to pretend otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Congressman Phillip Burton, Assemblyman Willie Brown, {{and other}} California {{politicians}} recognized the growing clout {{and organization of}} homosexuals in the city, and courted their votes by attending meetings {{of gay and lesbian}} organizations. Brown pushed for legalization of sex between consenting adults in 1969 but failed. SIR was also pursued by popular moderate Supervisor Dianne Feinstein in her bid to become mayor, opposing Alioto. Ex-policeman Richard Hongisto worked for 10 years to change the conservative views of the San Francisco Police Department, and also actively appealed to the gay community, which responded by raising significant funds for his campaign for sheriff. Though Feinstein was unsuccessful, Hongisto's win in 1971 showed the political clout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> community.|$|E

50|$|Before {{and during}} <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1986 <b>Gay</b> Games there was mass media about Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) {{and how it}} was {{affecting}} <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> community. With <b>the</b> number of LGBT members at <b>the</b> <b>Gay</b> Games <b>the</b> founder Waddell took this time try and break <b>the</b> stereotype <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AIDS with a show <b>of</b> athleticism <b>the</b> <b>Gay</b> Games had to offer. This also was a time that volunteers would provide safe sex materials along with condoms to educate the public.|$|R

5|$|News of Chatwin's AIDS {{diagnosis}} first {{surfaced in}} September 1988. However, {{at the time}} of his death, obituaries referred to Chatwin's statements about a rare fungal infection. Following his death, members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> community criticised Chatwin for lacking the courage to reveal the true nature of his illness, which some people think would have raised public awareness of AIDS, as he was one of the first high-profile individuals in Great Britain known to have contracted HIV.|$|E
5|$|On January 1, 2015, the Cincinnati-based LGBT {{rights group}} Support Marriage Equality Ohio hosted a vigil for Alcorn outside Kings High School.

A further vigil was {{organized}} by both The Diverse City Youth Chorus {{in partnership with the}} Cincinnati chapter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gay,</b> Lesbian and Straight Education Network at the Clifton Cultural Arts Center for January 10. The vigil location at the Clifton Cultural Arts Center was moved to the Woodward Theater, {{to make way for a}} larger setting. The event was attended by over 500 people.|$|E
5|$|The Stonewall riots (also {{referred}} to as the Stonewall uprising or the Stonewall rebellion) were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> (LGBT) community against a police raid {{that took place in the}} early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. They are widely considered to constitute the most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Despite DOMA, Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} to select openly gay persons for administrative positions, and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights. During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled. Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and {{for the private sector}} Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996. Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign. Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013. He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.|$|E
5|$|Save Our Children, Inc. was a {{political}} coalition formed in 1977 in Miami, Florida to overturn a recently legislated county ordinance that banned discrimination in areas of housing, employment, and public accommodation based on sexual orientation. The coalition was publicly headed by celebrity singer Anita Bryant, who claimed the ordinance discriminated against her right to teach her children biblical morality. It was a well-organized campaign that initiated a bitter political fight between unprepared gay activists and highly motivated Christian fundamentalists. When {{the repeal of the}} ordinance went to a vote, it attracted the largest response of any special election in Dade County's history, passing by 70%. In response to this vote, a group of gay and lesbian community members formed Pride South Florida, now known as Pride Fort Lauderdale, an organization whose mission was to fight for the rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> and lesbian community in South Florida.|$|E

5|$|The {{public image}} of homosexuals changed with liberalized social {{attitudes of the}} late 1960s. In 1969, the Stonewall riots {{occurred}} in New York City, marking the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> rights movement. Though gay life in Miami was intensely closeted, and bars were subject to frequent raids, Christ Metropolitan Community Church—a congregation for gay and lesbian Christians in Miami—was founded in 1970 as a religious outlet, attracting hundreds of parishioners. The 1972 Democratic National Convention was held in Miami, featuring, for the first time, a public speech about the rights of {{gay men and lesbians}} by openly gay San Francisco political activist Jim Foster. Jack Campbell opened the Miami branch of Club Baths in 1974. When it was raided, he made sure that all charges against those arrested were dropped, filed a lawsuit against the Miami Police Department prohibiting further harassment, and received a formal apology from the police. Even the depiction of gay men and lesbians in the local newspaper had changed to that of a silent, oppressed minority. By 1977, Miami was one of nearly 40cities in the U.S. that had passed ordinances outlawing discrimination against gay men and lesbians.|$|E
5|$|From May 1980 {{to early}} 1981 he acted as {{editor for the}} {{magazine}} POL. In 1982, {{he moved to the}} neighbouring state of Victoria, and was appointed the Director of Tourism. This sparked an outcry in South Australia due to the two states' traditional rivalry. For his part, Dunstan said that he had yearned to be given a role in shaping and building the future of his native state, but that he had been snubbed for three years. He said that public figures in South Australia had told him that his high profile and ability to overshadow others could have caused a loss of face to them, and thus his departure would be seen favourably by them, while Victoria's offer gave him an opportunity to be constructive. Dunstan was appointed to the Victorian Economic Development Corporation on 12 July 1983, resigning on 23 June 1986. Dunstan stayed in the Director of Tourism role until 1986, when he returned to Adelaide after falling out with the government of John Cain. His retirement from these positions followed the provocative publication of a photograph of him with Monsignor Porcamadonna, member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> community Order of Perpetual Indulgence, taken after he had launched a collection of coming out stories by gay historian Gary Wotherspoon.|$|E

25|$|In her 2003 book Unpacking Queer Politics: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective, Australian radical lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys {{advances}} {{the position}} that lesbian culture has been negatively affected by emulating the sexist influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> male subculture of dominant/​submissive sexuality. While she stresses that many gay men who were members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> liberation movement repudiated sadomasochism, she writes that the dominant gay male perspective has promoted sadomasochistic sexuality {{to the detriment of}} lesbians and feminist women.|$|E
