500|$|The next National Woman’s Rights Convention met in Cincinnati on October 17 and 18, 1855. It {{was here}} that Stone {{delivered}} impromptu remarks that became famous as her [...] "disappointment" [...] speech. When a heckler interrupted the proceedings, calling female speakers [...] "a few disappointed women," [...] Stone retorted that yes, she was indeed a [...] "disappointed woman." [...] "In education, in marriage, in religion, in everything, disappointment is the lot of woman. It shall be the business <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> deepen this disappointment in every woman's heart until she bows down to it no longer." [...] The convention adopted Stone’s resolution calling for the circulation of petitions and saying it was “the duty of women in their respective States to ask the legislators for the elective franchise.” Following the convention, suffrage petitioning {{took place in the}} New England states, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nebraska, with resultant legislative hearings or action in Nebraska and Wisconsin. Amelia Bloomer, recently moved to Iowa near the Nebraska border, took up the work in that area, while the Indiana Woman’s Rights Society, at least one of whose officers was at the Cincinnati convention, directed the work in Indiana. Stone had helped launch the New York campaign at a state woman’s rights convention in Saratoga Springs in August, and at the Cleveland convention recruited workers for it, {{as well as for the}} work in Illinois, Michigan and Ohio. Stone took charge of the work in Ohio, her new home state, drafting its petition, placing it in Ohio newspapers and circulating it during lectures across southern Ohio while her recruit worked in the northern part of the state. Stone also lectured in Illinois and Indiana in support of the petition drives there and personally introduced the work in Wisconsin, where she found volunteers to circulate the petition and legislators to introduce them in both houses of the legislature.|$|E
500|$|Yesterday Major BOYLE Roche, {{representative}} in parliament for Tralee (who is raising {{a body of}} men for his Majesty's service) began recruiting here, and met with great success, which is not surprising, if we consider his connexions, and the uncommon support he has received from the noblemen and gentlemen of this province. His method of enlisting was as uncommon as it was pleasing to those who viewed the procession, which was as follows: Major Roche, bearing a large purse of gold. Captain Cowley. A great number of likely recruits. An elegant band of music, consisting of French horns, hautboys , clarionets, and bassoons, playing God Save the King. A large brewer's dray, with five-barrels of beer, the horse richly caparisoned and ornamented with ribbands. Two draymen with cockades to serve the beer, The recruiting serjeant. Drums [...] fifes. Another division of recruits. The returning soldiers. Prodigious concourse of [...] The following speech was made by Major Roche to the populace: Being appointed, through the favour of [...] most excellent governor, to raise a body of men for the service of his Majesty, I think it [...] most happy circumstance <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> be the instrument of leading you to honour and renown. The laurels fought for and obtained in all parts [...] the globe [...] war, have procured us a fame so glorious {{as not to be}} equalled by people in any fame not to be sullied by the assaults of prejudice, nor the effects of time: not an action in which we were not victorious, not a siege in which we were not honoured. Will you, my dear countrymen, permit those laurels to fade, or those actions to be forgotten? No, forbid it, heaven! Let us now that we have it in our power convey to later posterity a renewal of our fidelity, and a confirmation of our loyalty. A more critical period never presented itself, nor had we ever a fairer opportunity of shewing our attachment to the illustrious house of Hanover, than the present, as his Majesty's deluded subjects in America are in open rebellion, and like unnatural children, wound their ever indulgent parent, forgetting the torrents of blood spilt, and heap of treasure expended for their preservation. His Sacred Majesty now calls and our fidelity obliges us, and I hope your instinct prompts you, to obey the dictates of so [...] a master. Let us then, my brave and loyal countrymen, join hearts and hands and cheerfully step forth in the glorious cause of our Creator, our King and our Country.|$|E
