5|$|It {{was while}} Roger was Theobald's clerk {{that he made}} lasting friendships with Gilbert Foliot and Hugh de Puiset. Roger {{attended}} the Council of Reims in 1148 with Theobald, John of Salisbury, and possibly Thomas Becket.

While it was later recalled that Roger and Becket did not get along, {{there is no evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>hatred</b> between the two before the Becket crisis happened.|$|E
60|$|In {{the mind}} of Alexis Paulvitch there lingered no {{thoughts}} of revenge--only a dull <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> the man whom he and Rokoff had tried to break, and failed. There was <b>hatred,</b> too, <b>of</b> the memory of Rokoff, for Rokoff had led him into the horrors he had undergone. There was <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> the police of a score of cities from which he had had to flee. There was <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> law, <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> order, <b>hatred</b> <b>of</b> everything. Every moment of the man's waking life was filled with morbid thought of hatred--he had become mentally as he was physically in outward appearance, the personification of the blighting emotion of Hate. He had {{little or nothing to}} do with the men who had rescued him. He was too weak to work and too morose for company, and so they quickly left him alone to his own devices.|$|R

But God would administer justice which would lead to the abasement of Edom and offer hope to Judah. Victims <b>of</b> ethnic <b>hatred</b> in Africa should console themselves with the fact that God will administer justice that would see to the punishment of those who take advantage of their condition and offer them (victims <b>of</b> ethnic <b>hatred)</b> a better future.

5|$|God of War is a third-person hack and slash action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Santa Monica Studio {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). First released on March 22, 2005, for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) console, {{it is the first}} installment in the series of the same name and the third chronologically. Loosely based on Greek mythology, it is set in ancient Greece with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist Kratos, a Spartan warrior who serves the Olympian Gods. The goddess Athena tasks Kratos with killing Ares, the God of War and Kratos' former mentor who tricked Kratos into killing his own wife and daughter. As Ares besieges Athens out <b>of</b> <b>hatred</b> for Athena, Kratos embarks on a quest to find the one object capable of stopping the god once and for all: the legendary Pandora's Box.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Wilis have cornered {{a terrified}} Hilarion. They use their magic {{to force him}} to dance until he is nearly dead, and then drown him in a nearby lake. Then they turn on Albrecht, {{sentencing}} him to death as well. He pleads to Myrtha for his life, but she coldly refuses. Giselle's pleas are also dismissed and Albrecht is forced to dance until sunrise. However, the power of Giselle's love counters the Wilis' magic and spares his life. The other spirits return to their graves at daybreak, but Giselle has broken through the chains <b>of</b> <b>hatred</b> and vengeance that control the Wilis, and is thus released from their powers. After bidding a tender farewell to Albrecht, Giselle returns to her grave to rest in peace.|$|E
5|$|The Boat Captain– A humorous addition, the Boat Captain {{encountered}} Kratos {{on several}} occasions, although these were always to the Boat Captain's detriment. In God of War, Kratos ignored him {{when in the}} belly of the Hydra and brushed him aside in the Underworld. In God of War II, the Boat Captain fled from Kratos as a spirit even though summoned to fight him, and in God of War III, he left a note <b>of</b> <b>hatred</b> towards Kratos in the Underworld and his voice was heard in Kratos' psyche. The character was voiced by Keith Ferguson in God of War and God of War II, and Josh Keaton in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E

5|$|When {{the game}} starts, Kratos has been serving the gods for ten years. He kills the Hydra {{on behalf of}} Poseidon, but he has grown tired of his service and suffering. He summons Athena, who states that if Kratos {{performs}} one final act—the murder of Ares—he will be forgiven for killing his family. Ares is waging war on the city of Athens out <b>of</b> <b>hatred</b> and jealousy of his sister Athena, who assigns Kratos to destroy Ares because Zeus has forbidden divine intervention. Athena guides Kratos to the war-torn Athens. After a strange encounter with a gravedigger who encourages him to continue his task, Kratos battles his way to Athens's oracle, finds her, and learns {{that the only way}} to defeat Ares is with Pandora's Box, a mythical artifact that grants the power to kill a god.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{prosecutors}} {{launched an}} investigation {{to determine if}} he had acted out <b>of</b> <b>hatred</b> for Obama. Writings by Ortega-Hernandez and testimonies from {{those who knew him}} revealed that he believed that he was Jesus, and that President Obama was the Antichrist and the devil. Ortega-Hernandez was not found to be affiliated with any extremist groups. In September 2013, Ortega-Hernandez pled guilty to two of the nineteen charges against him: one count of destruction of property and one count of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence. As part of his plea bargain, the remaining charges were dropped, including the charge of attempting to assassinate the President, which carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
