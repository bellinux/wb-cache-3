40|$|The use of <b>on-call</b> <b>work</b> in {{industry}} has now surpassed that of shiftwork and night work. Industries {{as a whole}} make use of <b>on-call</b> <b>work</b> daily {{as a way to}} maintain 24 / 7 operations whilst also reducing costs. Despite this, <b>on-call</b> <b>work</b> remains underresearched and no best practice or management guidelines are available. As the first substantial piece of human factors work examining <b>on-call</b> <b>work</b> in the rail industry, this thesis has the overall aim of increasing the understanding of on-call scheduling systems of work, and also to provide recommendations to the planning and management of <b>on-call</b> <b>work</b> in the rail industry which may also be applied in other industries. A semi-structured interview study with 72 rail maintenance on-call workers of Great Britain rail infrastructure owner and operator (Network Rail) explored on-call arrangements in place and the perceived unwanted consequences of this type of work. Anxiety, fatigue, and reduced well-being were perceived as the main consequences of working on-call. The findings also indicate that when discussing on-call there are three separate on-call situations; being on-call, receiving calls, and responding to calls; which influence the study variables differently. From the key themes identified initially an on-call questionnaire for managerial staff was developed and data from across the country generating 479 individual responses. A two-week diary study (one week on-call and the week after) with 26 participants aimed to collect real-time ratings. Results indicated that working on-call was perceived as a leading cause of stress, poor quality of sleep and fatigue. This is due to the inherent unpredictability of <b>on-call</b> <b>work,</b> which is the key differentiating factor between <b>on-call</b> <b>work</b> and other types of working-hours systems. Receiving and responding to calls were perceived as detrimental to general well-being both to workers and their families, fatigue, and performance. The work performed for this thesis allowed the development of the first on-call specific framework that identifies not only the key factors at play but also the relationships between them. It presents a set of principles or theories that other researchers can use to guide future research and that industry professionals can use to deliver more human friendly <b>on-call</b> <b>work</b> management processes and procedures...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study {{measures}} {{the association between}} hospital staff’s job strain (JS), mental quality of life (MQL) {{and how they are}} influenced by the organization models within emergency and critical care units. Material and Methods: This study describes workers employed in emergency departments and intensive care units of a French public hospital. A selfadministered questionnaire was used to survey the demographic and organizational characteristics of their work, as well as work-related mental stress, psychosocial and organizational constraints, and their MQL. Results: Among 145 workers participating in the study, 59. 3 % of them report job strain and 54. 5 % of them have low MQL scores. The majority of staff with job strain has reported working more than 2 weekends per month, were regularly <b>on-call,</b> <b>worked</b> in dysfunctional environments and did not participate in regular meetings. The staff with low MQL worked more frequently in dysfunctional environments, had significant complaints regarding employer’s efforts to promote communications or provide adequate staffing levels than the workers with a high MQL score. Conclusions: If stress reduction and improved MQL in emergency and intensive care units is to be achieved, hospital management needs to design work schedules that provide a better balance between working and non-working hours. Additionally, ergonomic design, functional environments and improved communications needs to be implemented...|$|R
40|$|Atypical work forms – such as {{independent}} contracting, <b>on-call,</b> or temporary <b>work</b> – {{have been criticized}} as providing employment that is more precarious than that offered by regular (open-ended) employment. One of the concerns attached to these work forms is that they allow employers to evade labor market protections afforded to regular workers. In such cases, we {{might be expected to}} see a greater prevalence of atypical workers in those states with greater labor market protections. We test for this possibility using Current Population Survey data from 1995 to 2005.

40|$|Atypical employment, such as temporary, <b>on-call</b> and {{contract}} <b>work,</b> {{has been found}} disproportionately to attract the jobless.

Using data from the Current Population Survey, we investigate the implications of the initial job-finding strategies pursued by the jobless for their short- and medium-term employment stability. At first sight, it appears that taking an offer of regular employment provides the greatest degree of employment continuity for the jobless. However, closer inspection indicates that the jobless who take up atypical employment are not only more likely to be employed 1 month and 1 year later than those who continue to search, but also to enjoy employment continuity that is not less favourable than that offered by regular, open-ended employment. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{associations}} between casualized employment and turnover intention in home care. Casualized employment refers to employment conditions of non-permanent contracts, part-time or casual hours, involuntary hours, <b>on-call</b> <b>work,</b> split shifts, pay per visit, and hourly pay with variable hours. Casualized employment also refers to perceived employment insecurity and labour market insecurity. Data are from a survey of 991 visiting nurses, therapists and home support workers in a medium-sized city in Ontario, Canada. Results show that, controlling for many other factors, casual hours and perceived employment insecurity and labour market insecurity are positively and <b>on-call</b> <b>work</b> is negatively associated with home care workers' turnover intention. Non-permanent contract, part-time hours, involuntary hours, split shifts, and non-salaried pay are features of the market-modelled home care work environment and therefore may not be associated with turnover intention.

[...] They are compensated in the mid-range (averaging $13,000 annually) for non-patient activities, such as speaking engagements or acting as an expert witness; they also saw a 12% increase in salary from 2014 - 2015 (which was not out of line with many other physician specialties that year). While emergency physicians work 8-12 hour shifts and do not tend to <b>work</b> <b>on-call,</b> the high level of stress and need for strong diagnostic and triage capabilities for the undifferentiated, acute patient contributes to arguments justifying higher salaries for these physicians. Emergency care must be available every hour of every day, and requires a doctor to be available on site 24/7, unlike an outpatient clinic or some other hospital departments that have more limited hours, and may only call a physician in when needed. The necessity to have a physician on staff along with all other diagnostic services available every hour of every day is thus a costly arrangement for hospitals.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between on-call duty exposure (active and total on-call hours a month, number of calls per duty) and employees’ experiences of being on-call (stress due to unpredictability, ability to relax during inactive on-call periods, restrictions during on-call duties, <b>on-call</b> <b>work</b> demands, and satisfaction with compensation for on-call duties) {{on the one hand and}} fatigue, strain-based and time-based work-home interference (WHI), and perceived on-call performance difficulties (PPD) on the other hand. Methods. Cross-sectional survey data were collected among a large heterogeneous sample of Dutch employees (N= 5437). The final sample consisted of 157 on-call workers (23 – 69 years, 71 % males). Data were analyzed by means of hierarchical regression analyses (controlling for age and job characteristics). Results. Differences in <b>on-call</b> <b>work</b> exposure were not systematically related to fatigue, WHI, and PPD (all p’s 0. 50). The experience of being on-call explained a medium proportion of the variation in fatigue and strain-based WHI and a medium to large proportion of the variation in time-based WHI and PPD over and above the control variables.

40|$|Abstract Background Physicians' {{mental health}} may be {{adversely}} affected {{by the number of}} days of work and time spent on-call, and improved by sleep and days-off. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the associations of depressive symptoms with taking days of off duty, hours of sleep, and the number of days of <b>on-call</b> and overnight <b>work</b> among physicians working in Japanese hospitals. Methods A cross-sectional study as a national survey was conducted by mail. The study population was 10, 000 randomly selected physicians working in hospitals who were also members of the Japan Medical Association (response rate 40. 5 %). Self-reported anonymous questionnaire was sent to assess the number of days off-duty, overnight <b>work,</b> and <b>on-calls,</b> and the average number of sleep hours on days not working overnight in the previous one month. Depressive state was determined by the Japanese version of the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the associations between depressive symptoms and the studied variables. Results Among the respondents, 8. 3 % of men and 10. 5 % of women were determined to be depressed. For both men and women, depressive state was associated with having no off-duty days and averaging less than 5 hours of sleep on days not doing overnight work. Depressive state was positively associated with being on-call more than 5 days per month for men, and more than 8 days per month for women, and was negatively associated with being off-duty more than 8 days per month for men. Conclusion Some physicians need some support to maintain their mental health. Physicians who do not take enough days-off, who reduced sleep hours, and who have certain number of days on-calls may develop depressive symptoms. </p...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} the {{challenges}} that European law poses for national legislation and practices regarding working time. The regulation of working time is situated {{at the crossroads of}} health and safety regulations and employment protection. The European Union has acknowledged the need to regulate and limit working time in the Working Time Directive (WTD); Directive 2003 / 88 /EC. This chapter examines the major topics of discussion concerning issues related to the implementation of the WTD in the Netherlands, notably annualised hours, flexible hours, the individual opt-out, <b>on-call</b> <b>work</b> and shift work. In the Netherlands trade unions consider that the Directive has been transposed into national law in a way which has reduced the level of protection previously available. However, our research has led {{to the conclusion that the}} implementation in the Netherlands is flexible because collective agreements are playing an important role in implementing the Working Time Directive in this country. Despite some problems, the implementation of the WTD in the Netherlands has not been controversial. However, some discrepancies between EU law and domestic definitions of the crucial concept of working time do persist which can lead to further litigation, especially in the case of <b>on-call</b> <b>work.</b> In general terms, the implementation of the WTD has left the main problem relating to working time in the Netherlands, its ‘successful’ part-time model, untouched...|$|E

40|$|On-call {{working time}} {{arrangements}} are increasingly common, involve work {{only in the}} event of an unpredictable incident and exist primarily outside of standard hours. Like other non-standard working time arrangements, <b>on-call</b> <b>work</b> disrupts sleep and can therefore have negative effects on health, safety and performance. Unlike other non-standard working time arrangements, <b>on-call</b> <b>work</b> often allows sleep opportunities between calls. Any sleep obtained during on-call periods will be beneficial for waking performance. However, there is evidence that sleep while on call may be of substantially reduced restorative value because of the expectation of receiving the call and apprehension about missing the call. In turn, waking from sleep to respond to a call may be associated with temporary increases in performance impairment. This is dependent on characteristics of both the preceding sleep, the tasks required upon waking and the availability and utility of any countermeasures to support the transition from sleep to wake. In this paper, we critically evaluate the evidence both for and against sleeping during on-call periods and conclude that some sleep, even if it is of reduced quality and broken by repeated calls, is a good strategy. We also note, however, that organisations utilising on-call working time arrangements need to systematically manage the likelihood that on-call sleep can be associated with temporary performance impairments upon waking. Given that the majority of work in this area has been laboratory-based, there is a significant need for field-based investigations of the magnitude of sleep inertia, in addition to the utility of sleep inertia countermeasures. Field studies should include working with subject matter experts to identify the real-world impacts of changes in performance associated with sleeping, or not sleeping, whilst on call...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to explore precariously employed individuals’experiences and perceptions of employment strain and its effect on their psychological well-being in Gävleborg County, Sweden. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 respondents residing in Gävleborg County about their experiences of precarious employment and their perceptions of the relationship between their precarious employment and psychological well-being. Thematic analysis was conducted to relate the results to the employment strain framework. Results: The main theme to emerge in the data was managing stress. Respondent’s perceived significant stress related to keeping employment as well as having future work. In addition, they had difficulties in coping with everyday life because of economic strain, lack of work opportunities and isolation. Conclusions: The results of this study highlight how precariously employed individuals are unable to cope with the stress related to uncertainty in maintaining their current work or having control of their working hours.

Unemployment rates declined to 30 -year lows, real wages grew even for those {{on the bottom of}} the economic ladder, and the percentage of Americans lacking health insurance declined. Yet nonstandard employment – part-time work, temping, contract work, self-employment, <b>on-call</b> <b>work,</b> day labor – remained commonplace in this booming economy.

Cross-sectional data of N = 169 Dutch distal on-call workers were analysed with multivariate logistic regression.

Poor mental health and high work–family interference were associated with higher need for recovery in all three scenarios (i–iii), whereas high work demands was only associated with being on-call (ii and iii). The results suggest that the mere possibility of being called affects the need for recovery, especially in workers reporting poor mental health, high-work demands and work–family interference. Practitioner summary: <b>On-call</b> <b>work</b> is a scarcely studied but demanding working time arrangement. We examined need for recovery and its associations with age, health, work and social characteristics among distal on-call workers. The results suggest that the mere possibility of being called can affect worker well-being and need for recovery. Keywords: work schedule tolerance, health, work–family interference, ag...|$|E
40|$|We hypothesise {{that due}} to a lower quality of working life and higher job insecurity, the health and work-related attitudes of {{temporary}} workers may be less positive compared to permanent workers. Therefore, we aimed to (1) examine differences between contract groups (i. e. permanent contract, temporary contract with prospect of permanent work, fixed-term contract, temporary agency contract and on-call contract) {{in the quality of}} working life, job insecurity, health and work-related attitudes and (2) investigate whether these latter contract group differences in health and work-related attitudes can be explained by differences in the quality of working life and/or job insecurity. Data were collected from the Netherlands Working Conditions Survey 2008 (N = 21, 639), and Hypotheses were tested using analysis of variance and cross-table analysis. Temporary work was associated with fewer task demands and lower autonomy and was more often passive or high-strain work, while permanent work was more often active work. Except for <b>on-call</b> <b>work,</b> temporary work was more insecure and associated with worse health and work-related attitude scores than permanent work. Finally, the quality of working life and job insecurity partly accounted for most contract differences in work-related attitudes but not in health. Especially agency workers have a lower health status and worse work-related attitudes. Job redesign measures regarding their quality of working life and job insecurity are recommended...|$|E
40|$|Objectives The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to examine (1) the association between flexible employment and nurses' intention to leave the profession, and (2) whether or not support at work mediates the association between flexible employment and nurses' intention to leave the profession. Flexible employment is analyzed objectively using non-permanent contract, part-time employment status, casual employment status, involuntary hours and <b>on-call</b> <b>work,</b> and subjectively using job insecurity. Support at work refers to organizational, supervisor and peer support. Methods Data come from our survey of 1396 nurses employed in three teaching hospitals in Southern Ontario. Descriptive statistics are provided. Bivariate correlations, hierarchical regression analysis and mediation tests are conducted. Results Compared to those in full-time employment, nurses in part-time employment {{do not intend to}} leave the profession. None of the other objective flexible employment factors are associated with intention to leave the profession. Perceived job insecurity is associated with intention to leave the profession. Low support at work contributes to intention to leave the profession and mediates the association between job insecurity and intention to leave the profession. Conclusions The study provides evidence to health sector managers and policy makers that part-time employment, perceived job security and support at work are important factors to consider in efforts to retain nurses in the profession. Nurses Flexible employment Job insecurity Intention to leave the profession...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the perceptions of}} physiotherapists with different levels of context related experience undertaking emergency on-call duties in New Zealand (NZ). A purpose-designed questionnaire was developed to investigate whether differences existed between novice and expert physiotherapists in their perceptions of emergency on-call duties and in their responses to an emergency on-call vignette. A questionnaire was administered to 71 participants with varying levels of on-call experience, in all centres providing emergency on-call services within NZ. Years of active emergency on-call experience were used to classify novices (less than 5 years) and experts (more than 5 years). A response rate of 79 % (n = 56) was obtained. Significant differences between novices and experts were seen in self-rated confidence scores, self-rated stress levels and perceived support required whilst undertaking emergency oncall duties (all p <. 001). There were {{no statistically significant differences}} between novices and experts in response to any questions in the vignette. The results of this study provide useful information for service providers regarding the perceptions and concerns of emergency on-call physiotherapists. It is recommended that novice physiotherapists be provided with better opportunities to gain specific context related experience prior to undertaking emergency on-call duties in order to improve confidence levels and reduce stress associated with undertaking on-call duties. In addition, specific continuing professional development (CPD) opportunities and support mechanisms should be provided for all staff undertaking emergency <b>on-call</b> <b>work...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the future}} many changes will {{extensively}} affect workforce, workplace and work organization. The changes {{expected in the}} workforce will be {{a larger share of}} workers over 55 years and of women and a larger share of migrants. Two main changes will affect the workplace: the increasing percentage of jobs in the service sector and the decreasing permanent relationship of the worker with the workplace with an increase in temporary work, <b>on-call</b> <b>work</b> and work at home. The evolution of global trade is accelerating the transformation of work organization, with important changes in management systems, production and services processes and their influence on the way work is performed. Although working conditions will continue to improve overall, many matters remain to be resolved due to the increase in workers’ health demands and awareness. Old diseases, such as tuberculosis, and new aspects of the more common health disorders, such as stress related-disorders, will represent a challenge for the specialist. In addition, new hazards, such as the exposure to nanoparticles or to static magnetic fields, will be conditions worthy to be considered for the possible implication to health. The workplace will represent a privileged place to promote health and well being of workers aiming at ensuring an effective healthy lifestyle, career and employment security. In this rapidly changing and demanding context, a new challenge for the occupational physicians will start with having a good understanding of the implications for adhering to the ethical principles and to values of quality, equity, relevance and cost-effectiveness and maintaining a balance among them...|$|E
