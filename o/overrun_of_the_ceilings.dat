2500|$|On 7 August 2008, 10% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plenary chamber {{collapsed}}. No one was injured, as Parliament was {{not meeting}} at the time (it was in summer recess), though a number of seats were damaged. A first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> collapsed at 18.00 CET followed by a second part at 22.36 CET. No extreme weather conditions were reported and the structure was new, so {{it was assumed that}} <b>the</b> false <b>ceiling</b> had a defect. The President's office stated that a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> had been affected and that [...] "The preliminary results have revealed that <b>the</b> partial collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> resulted from <b>the</b> breakage <b>of</b> parts holding <b>the</b> suspended <b>ceiling</b> that connects it with <b>the</b> actual structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ceiling." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{building}} {{was a little}} unstable and had already shifted considerably prior to Michelangelo's work of 1508, causing cracking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> <b>the</b> crack in the [...] "Judith" [...] pendentive being so large {{that it had to}} be filled with bricks and mortar before painting. <b>The</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> provided Michelangelo an irregular surface due to cracks and water seepage.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> {{iconography}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> has had various interpretations in the past, {{some elements}} {{of which have been}} contradicted by modern scholarship. Others, such as <b>the</b> identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> figures in the lunettes and spandrels, continue to defy interpretation. Modern scholars have sought, as yet unsuccessfully, to determine a written source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theological program <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and have questioned {{whether or not it was}} entirely devised by the artist himself, who was both an avid reader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bible and a genius. Also of interest to some modern scholars is <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> how Michelangelo's own spiritual and psychological state is reflected in the iconography and <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> One such speculation is that Michelangelo was tormented by conflict between homosexual desires and passionate Christian beliefs.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> {{walls and}} <b>ceilings</b> are molded and painted. Interestingly, they bear both Jewish and Polish motifs.

5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and <b>the</b> inaccessibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> frescoes, <b>the</b> precise nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{damage and}} the {{problems}} that would be encountered by the restoration team could not be entirely foreseen until after the decision to restore was taken, and the scaffolding was in place. According to Colalucci, the continued scientific analysis and <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restorers to the particular problems was an ongoing part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process, rather than the conservation team deciding on a single treatment for every part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building.|$|R

50|$|A {{reflected}} ceiling plan (RCP) shows a view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room as if {{looking from}} above, through <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> at a mirror installed one foot below <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> level, which shows <b>the</b> reflected image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> above.

40|$|This paper proposes {{modifications}} to the tradional Ceiling Bounce Model and uses it to characterize diffuse indoor optical wireless channel by analyzing <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> transceiver position on signal propagation properties. The modified approach uses a combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tradional <b>ceiling</b> bounce method and a statistical approach. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> different transmitter-receiver separations and height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> on path loss and delay spread are studied in detail...|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} system generates additional IDs by {{utilizing a}} combined configuration. This novel configuration combines unique ID encoding landmarks with repeated ID encoding landmarks {{to improve the}} estimation accuracy and reduce the production, ID, and computational costs. Especially, the proposed configuration is suitable for positioning systems based on other sensors. A disadvantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed system is that the prior knowledge used for estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mobile robot is prepared by hand, which incurs some inescapable artificial errors. Equation (3) was obtained for a fixed height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> This indicates that the proposed system is currently unable to perform accurately when <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> changes.|$|R
