5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle, Dinah faces off against her former friend, accidentally decapitating Edaniel in the process. An enraged Edrear {{attempts}} to kill her, but eventually halts when Dinah {{points out that}} he's crying for his brother, something that he's normally unable to do and that's being caused by Maphohetka's influence. Knowing that he's been compromised, Edrear stabs himself with his own sword, leaving Dinah to mourn him and share one kiss. Maphohetka, taking the opportunity, destroys Dinah's scythe (the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> had that could potentially kill her) and ends up mutating into a large monster. After Dinah is captured in Maphohetka's body, she happens upon the entity's core, which is Maphohetka's decayed corpse. Using Eniri's bracelet to see into the monster, she finds that {{a piece of the}} cross Maphohetka was stabbed with during her hanging is still lodged in her chest, allowing Dinah to conclude that the piece is what keeps the evil spirit anchored in the living world. Dinah removes the cross shard, causing Maphohetka to fade away.|$|E

A distraught Regina notes that Emma has done exactly what her mother did: unintentionally ruin her chance for happiness by naively trying to make things better. Reduced to tears, Regina ominously warns Emma that Marian had better be the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> brought back. Back at the barn, a container from Rumplestiltskin's vault (which Hook accidentally disturbed in the vault) is revealed to have fallen through the portal. The lid pops off and releases a blue liquid, which after a moment coalesces into none other than Elsa. She removes her gloves and unleashes an icy blast that destroys her former prison, before heading out of the barn, {{leaving a trail of}} frozen ground behind her.|$|E

[...] We did one song and another song, and we were having fun making music. And actually it was a very privileged time. She wasn't under any kind of pressure, she had time to spend on it; it was the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> had to work on.|$|E
500|$|Collins then {{burst into}} tears and exclaimed that the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> had ever gotten from the store without paying was her free lunch. [...] This {{prompted}} renewed questioning from the investigator and manager because of the differing policies regarding free lunches at lobby food operations (not allowed) versus stores with lunch counters (allowed). Collins again requested and was refused {{the presence of a}} union representative. Based on the questioning, the investigator prepared a statement that Collins owed $160 for lunches but she refused to sign the statement. It was later found that most (if not all) of the employees at Store No. 98 (including the manager) took free lunches because they had never been informed of the policy prohibiting it. When the investigator contacted company headquarters during the interview, the company itself was uncertain whether the policy against free lunches was even in effect at that store.|$|E
500|$|... "1+1" [...] {{begins with}} a low {{fidelity}} indie rock arrangement which is brought about by distorted guitar arpeggios and a discreet pipe organ. Beyoncé sings a meandering melody as she alternately references the pleasures of love and sex. Using simple arithmetic to describe her undying love for her partner, she begins the first verse as she affirms to her romantic interest that the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> is sure about is her feelings for him, [...] "I don't know much about algebra, but I know that one plus one equals two ... If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn / 'Cause I got it with you". In the pre-chorus lines, Beyoncé expresses her reliance on her man without whom she believes to be incomplete as she sings, [...] "And it's me and you, that's all we'll have when the world is through / Because baby we ain't got nothing without love / Darling, you got enough love for the both of us".|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{character of}} Gerda, known as Anna, {{was one of}} the three major characters in the script at this time, along with the Snow Queen, Elsa and Kristoff, loosely based on Kay. The characters were not considered to be well-rounded or relatable, but an interpersonal, family dynamic was created once Anna and Elsa were established as sisters, an idea suggested by someone on the writing team that no one remembered who. This changed the story dramatically, shifting from the conflict between the good and the evil to the conflict between love and fear. Buck stated that their script still retained basic parts of the story and the character of Gerda, citing the similarities between the original story and his version, [...] " [...] won't give up on finding her friend Kai. The <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> really has in her, she's not a superhero or anything, but she has love. And it's love that conquers fear in the end." ...|$|E
500|$|James Chamberlin of IGN {{stated that}} the scenes in which Amber and House were working out terms for sharing Wilson were [...] "hysterical", and graded the episode with an 8.5 (out of 10). Gina Dinunno of TV Guide thought the episode was pretty good, and the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> was not very fond of was that she felt that the {{characters}} of Robert Chase and Allison Cameron seemed [...] "forced into the script". Jessica Paff, from Zap2it, reported that she was pleased that the love triangle between House, Amber and Wilson went on, despite House's blessing in the previous episode. Sara Morrison of Television Without Pity said she liked the jokes referring to [...] "Thirteen" [...] being bisexual. She graded the episode with an A+. Kal Penn submitted the episode on his behalf for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor - Drama Series, but the episode was not ultimately nominated.|$|E
500|$|Robert De Niro, who {{had spotted}} Streep in her stage {{production}} of The Cherry Orchard, {{suggested that she}} {{play the role of}} his girlfriend in the war film The Deer Hunter (1978). Cazale, who had been diagnosed with lung cancer, was also cast in the film, and Streep took on the role of a [...] "vague, stock girlfriend" [...] to remain with Cazale for the duration of filming. Longworth notes that Streep [...] "made a case for female empowerment by playing a woman to whom empowerment was a foreign concept—a normal lady from an average American small town, for whom subservience was the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> knew". Pauline Kael, who would later become a strong critic of Streep, remarked that she was a [...] "real beauty" [...] who brought much freshness to the film with her performance. The film's success exposed Streep to a wider audience and earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.|$|E

500|$|The story {{revolves}} around {{two young women}} who seemingly {{have little in common}} and do not know of the other's existence at the beginning. The eponymous Madlax is a legendary mercenary and assassin in the fictional civil war-torn country of Gazth-Sonika, who cannot remember her past or indeed her real name before twelve years ago, when the war started. The other main character is Margaret Burton, the sole heir of a wealthy aristocratic family in the peaceful European country Nafrece. Twelve years before the story begins, an airliner Margaret and her mother were on crashed over Gazth-Sonika, and its passengers, as well as Margaret's father who led the rescuers, have been missing ever since. Margaret, however, mysteriously traveled back to Nafrece on her own, losing her memories prior to her return; the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> recalls is a single word, [...] "Madlax". With this thread linking the two girls, they both independently start investigating the powerful crime syndicate Enfant after its enigmatic mastermind shows interest in both of them.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 2 out of 4 stars, stating, [...] "The {{movie is a}} mess: a gassy costume epic with nobody at the center." [...] Ebert stated the film may have been {{educational}} for the test audience participants who wrote, [...] "Why does she have to die at the end?" [...] on their evaluation cards. In a review entitled Vivid Action Can't Save Miscast 'Joan, Todd McCarthy praised the film's action scenes and technical aspects, including Thierry Arbogast's cinematography, though overall gave a negative review. He criticised the casting of Jovovich, stating the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> brought to the film was [...] "her strikingly tall and skinny physicality, which is not exactly how one has been led to picture [...] ". Ron Wells from Film Threat, however, gave the film {{four out of five}} stars. Also praising the action scenes, Wells stated that the film's main strength was its [...] "adult ambiguities and relationships"; its decision not to portray Joan as a [...] "super-hero", but rather to let the audience decide whether she was a prophet or merely bipolar, concluding, [...] "This film, as most things that involve religion, is better understood if you learn not to take everything so literally." ...|$|E
500|$|Belldandy's {{capacities}} and talents are diverse, whether magical or worldly. Not only can she change {{the appearance of}} her clothing and levitate (and, by extension, fly), but she can also teleport through mirrors, speak to and understand animals, [...] "see" [...] people's emotions as auras, heal minor wounds by speeding metabolism, and [...] "speak" [...] to machines. Furthermore, she is a superb cook, and her singing skills are held {{to be the best}} in the heavens. She is also incapable of becoming inebriated on alcoholic drinks, but instead becomes so with soda. (One can is enough to send her in a drunken rampage—although given her personality, [...] "rampage" [...] takes an entirely different, but no less destructive, meaning). [...] During the manga's publication, more of Belldandy's capabilities are discovered, but she probably has many more : Urd notes that Belldandy loves accumulating [...] capabilities [...] but usually doesn't mention them herself. Among those seen in the manga, she has a Valkyrie diploma - as demonstrated when she neutralizes Thrym the Invincible in hand-to-hand combat - and she's a champion flying broom racer. the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> can't do is hurt others - provided Keichi isn't in harm's way, otherwise she will [...] "deal" [...] with anything and anyone standing in her way (see Thrym above for the most out of character example) whatever the cost on herself.|$|E

500|$|Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music wrote a {{positive}} {{review of the}} song and rated it {{four out of five}} stars. He wrote, [...] "So, essentially doing a song like this is rocky ground, {{but the good news is}} that Demi generally comes across as the kind of bright, scrappy, girl-next-door type, so it doesn't sound quite so preposterous when she insists that she's still quite normal, really." [...] McAlpine concluded his review, writing, [...] "You can almost hear the paparazzi cameras going off as she's singing. [...] Of course, the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> has to worry about now is that having made this very public declaration, if she slips up for a second, we'll all be watching..." [...] Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe said that Lovato shows [...] "her Gen-Y stripes", and [...] "forcibly rhymes 'everything's the same' with 'the La-La land machine' – pronounced, of course,' ma-SHAYN'." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included [...] "La La Land" [...] at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and wrote, [...] "Are Disney girls just naturally plagued by insecurity or is it all a plot to seem more real? Like Miley's [...] "Party in U.S.A.," [...] this song is all about how out of place Lovato feels in La La Land." ...|$|E

She states that The Deer Hunter [...] "evokes a version of dominant masculinity in which male friendship is a powerful force". It has a [...] "credibly humanist message", and that the [...] "slow study {{of the men in}} blissfully ignorant homeland machismo is crucial to it".|$|E

Looking at the necklace, the dwarfs thought Freyja to be most fair, and she the necklace. Freyja offered to buy the collar from them with silver and gold and other items of value. The dwarfs {{said that they had}} no lack of money, and that for the necklace the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> could offer them would be a night with each of them. [...] "Whether she liked it better or worse", Freyja agreed to the conditions, and so spent a night with each of the four dwarfs. The conditions were fulfilled and the necklace was hers.

While not {{technically}} her brother she sought out John Barnes of Earth-616 and falsified an ID so she could go stay close to him. This John Barnes was actually a pretty nice guy, so she pretended to be Rikki Baines, his schoolmate and best friend. Rikki heard {{that there was a}} new Captain America and she desperately tried to meet him, unbeknownst to Rikki that he was James Buchanan Barnes, the Earth 616 counterpart to her own grandfather. However, before she could meet him, she was intercepted by Black Widow, who knew exactly who Rikki was, and cautioned her about trying to meet Captain America.|$|R
2500|$|Merope Gaunt [...] was the {{daughter}} of Marvolo, sister of Morfin. Harry's first impression of her was that she looked [...] "like the most defeated person he had ever seen", probably because she lived in raggedness, squalor, and abuse. She married Tom Riddle Sr and became pregnant within three months of the wedding. It is suggested that she tricked her husband into loving her by using a love potion, but when she became pregnant, she chose to stop administering the potion. It is implied that Merope had grown tired of living the lie and thought that her husband might have grown to love her, or that he might have stayed for the sake of their unborn child; however, he left her. Desperate, Merope wandered through the streets of London. The <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> had left was the heavy gold locket that had once belonged to Salazar Slytherin, one of her family's most treasured items, which she sold for a small amount. When she was due to give birth, she stumbled into a Muggle orphanage, where she gave birth to her only son, Tom Marvolo Riddle. She died within the next hour.|$|E
2500|$|The {{match was}} far from being blissful. Damala {{developed}} the habit of openly criticizing and mocking Bernhardt {{in front of her}} friends. Bernhardt, in return, called him [...] "Gypsy Greek" [...] in an equal attempt to degrade him. However, in most cases, Bernhardt was so overwhelmed by her infatuation for him that she tolerated his insults and even begged him for forgiveness, behaviour which reaffirmed that Damala had the upper hand in the relationship. After Bernhardt left Russia to extend her tour to other European countries, Damala resigned from the Diplomatic Corps and followed Sarah's theatre circle. While in London, completing the final part of her tour, Bernhardt had yet another fight with Damala. Bernhardt was supposed to have created the role of playwright Victorien Sardou Theodora during the tour. Instead, she sent Sardou the telegram: [...] "I am going to die and my greatest regret is not having created your play. Adieu." [...] A few hours later, Sardou received a second message by Bernhardt which simply stated: [...] "I am not dead, I am married". When asked later by Sardou why she had wed, she somewhat naïvely responded that it was the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> had never done. Her impulsive decision to marry was probably at her own initiative, as Damala sarcastically admitted to friends that it was she who had proposed to him. The wedding took place on 4 April 1882 on London, a city that proved a convenient choice for marriage, since religious differences would have been a hindrance for a possible marriage in Paris: Bernhardt was a Roman Catholic and Damala Greek Orthodox. Bernhardt's son, Maurice, was hostile to Damala and against this marriage.|$|E

Regina and Robin show up and they look at her pregnant body, which has accelerated by seven months (from two months), a result of Emma's dark magic. Zelena is {{rushed to the hospital}} and says that Emma did this with her onion rings. Dr. Whale is there and Zelena says tells him to get her [...] "angry baby" [...] out, and Whale reminds her about the last baby he delivered, which she tried to steal. He then mocks her, telling her that she must have realized that having a baby was so much more fun than stealing one. Regina asks why his hair is blonde and spiked, with Dr. Whale replying that since Emma changed her hairstyle, he though he could do the same as well. As Dr. Whale continues to joke about Zelena, Regina mutters that they [...] "really need a new doctor in this town." [...] Belle and Mary Margaret rush in and tell them that Emma is coming for the baby, and that the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> needs other than Excalibur to snuff out the light are the cries of a newborn child. Zelena begs Regina to take off the cuff so she can defend herself and her baby, but Regina says no. Zelena immediately delivers a baby girl, as Regina and Mary Margaret wait in the hall. Mary asks if Regina is ready to meet her new family, but she says she doesn’t know. As Robin hold the newborn, Emma appears, throwing Whale against the wall yet again. Robin and Regina prepare to fight her, but Emma reveals that she wants Zelena instead, and disappears with her.|$|E
