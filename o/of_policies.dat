40|$|Despite a {{tremendous}} {{growth in the}} volume <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> analysis in the past decade, recent research indicates governmental decisionmakers make little direct use of such research; at best, policy-oriented research alters a decisionmaker's conceptualization <b>of</b> the <b>policy</b> problem over the long term. Previous efforts to explain policymakers'limited use <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> research have generally not considered the opportunities and constraints presented by specific decisionmaking contexts. To a large extent, the research utilization literature has focused on attitudinal and demographic characteristics of decisionmakers and has adopted as a central focus the "two-communities" theory which asserts that frequent, direct use <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> research by policymakers is unlikely because of the competing worldview and belief systems <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> researchers and policymakers. While the two-communities theory may partially explain the limited use <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> research, it ignores the institutional incentives motivating decisionmakers. More specifically, this earlier research does not consider the different motivations of policymakers and their relative impact on use <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> information. To expand the explanation <b>of</b> decisionmakers'use <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> information, I postulate a model <b>of</b> legislators'use <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> information that includes four types of factors that influence legislators'propensity to use policy information. These factors-worldview and attitude toward social science, perception <b>of</b> the way <b>policy</b> issues are considered in the legislature, perception of the legislative structure, and legislative orientations-combine two-communities type of independent variables and perceptions of the legislative environment. In this way, policymakers'use <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> information can be examined more realistically and comprehensively. Copyright 1987 by The Policy Studies Organization. ...|$|R
5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is what sort <b>of</b> <b>policies</b> {{directly or indirectly}} affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E

The army military commanders implemented backcountry patrols, wildlife protection and management, and protection of natural features.

The army effectively implemented law enforcement priorities and developed a ranger force that provided for prosecution and punishment of those engaged in illegal activity in the national parks. The National Park Service carried over a version of the campaign hat worn by members of the army during the last years of their management of Yellowstone National Park for use by Park Rangers.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, Paul {{called for}} a vote of no {{confidence}} in United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. Later that month, Paul blocked legislation that would strengthen safety rules {{for oil and gas}} pipelines, because, he stated, the bill was not strong enough. In October, Paul blocked a bill that would provide $36million in benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, saying that he was concerned that it could be used to aid domestic terrorists. This was in response to two alleged terrorists who came to the United States through a refugee program and were receiving welfare benefits when they were arrested in 2011 in Paul's hometown of Bowling Green. Paul lifted his hold on the bill after Democratic leaders promised to hold a Congressional hearing into how individuals are selected for refugee status and request an investigation on how the two suspects were admitted in the country through a refugee program. In June 2012, Paul endorsed Mitt Romney after it became apparent that he would be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election.

5|$|Overlapping the {{military}} chain of command, {{there was a}} plenipotentiary of the Foreign Office, Felix Benzler, reporting to the Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and for economic affairs, a representative of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, Franz Neuhausen. These power structures competed with each other, {{to a greater extent}} than anywhere else in occupied Europe. Meyszner's appointment further complicated an already complex situation, as prior to this decision, Turner had been responsible for police and security matters. Meyszner had to formally acknowledge Bader as his superior but received his orders from Hitler and Himmler. One of his priorities was to improve coordination <b>of</b> <b>policies</b> towards the Volksdeutsche (or Germans of Yugoslavia), concentrated in the Banat region, as the decision had been made in late 1941 to subject them to conscription in order to raise a Waffen-SS division. This decision, approved by Hitler a few days before Meyszner's appointment, had strengthened Himmler's case for a HSSPF in Belgrade.|$|E

Zinsou, who had a history of advocacy against the policies of the military, quickly drew the ire of the military leaders by pursuing a host <b>of</b> <b>policies</b> without consultation with them. In addition, to control continued deficits, Zinsou instituted a number of austerity measures and as a result alienated unions and the urban population. The result was that on 10 December 1969, Zinsou was taken into custody by military officers organized by Kouandété and Zinsou was sent to a remote military garrison near Natitingou. Following the coup, Kouandété found {{that he did not have}} the support to rule throughout the entire military, and so instead Paul-Emile de Souza (the director of military affairs for Zinsou's government) was named the provisional head of state as the head of a three person Military directorate (with Kouandété and Colonel Benoît Sinzogan holding the other seats). The military directorate decided to release Zinsou and hold new presidential elections in 1970 without the restrictions of the 1968 elections, thus allowing Apithy, Ahomadégbé, and Maga to run.|$|E

30|$|The {{composition}} {{of this paper}} is as follows. First, we want to analyze institutional reform such as public servant pension in social innovation and political negotiation process.

Second, we will analyze the reform process of public servant pension based on the model <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> advocacy.

Finally, we emphasize that the solution of the conflicts surrounding the system reform can be analyzed from the viewpoint <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> knowledge and policy community as social innovation.|$|R
