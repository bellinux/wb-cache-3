5|$|The {{function}} of the Maya stela was central to the ideology of Maya kingship {{from the very beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> Period through to {{the very end of the}} Terminal Classic (800–900). The hieroglyphic inscriptions on the stelae <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> period site of Piedras Negras played a key part in the decipherment of the script, with stelae being grouped around seven different structures and each group appearing to chart the life of a particular individual, with key dates being celebrated, such as birth, marriage and military victories. From these stelae, epigrapher Tatiana Proskouriakoff was able to identify that they contained details of royal rulers and their associates, rather than priests and gods as had previously been theorised.|$|E

5|$|December 2012 {{marked the}} {{conclusion}} of a b'ak'tun—a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in Central America prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the Olmec, it has become closely associated with the Maya civilization, whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900AD. The writing system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> Maya has been substantially deciphered, meaning that a corpus of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the European conquest.|$|E

It was the second best-selling video game in North America and the UK {{a few weeks after}} its release, and sold over 500,000 copies for PCs within the same period.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{principal}} Upanishads {{can be associated with}} one of the schools of exegesis of the four Vedas (shakhas). Many Shakhas are said to have existed, of which only a few remain. The new Upanishads often have little relation to the Vedic corpus and have not been cited or commented upon by any great Vedanta philosopher: their language differs from that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classic</b> Upanishads, being less subtle and more formalized. As a result, they are not difficult to comprehend for the modern reader.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of the}} 1940s, one of {{the most}} {{prolific}} and successful authors of this often downbeat brand of suspense tale was Cornell Woolrich (sometimes under the pseudonym George Hopley or William Irish).

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Itza Maya from Motul de San José began the northward migration of Maya peoples to the Yucatán Peninsula at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Classic</b> Period.
