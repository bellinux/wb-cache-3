500|$|After weak {{sales in}} 2009 of several {{titles in the}} Guitar Hero series, Activision {{proceeded}} to make several changes with their internal development teams. The company dissolved RedOctane, bringing {{in some of the}} staff directly into Activision. Activision further shuttered Neversoft's Guitar Hero division, pending the completion of Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, with further development in the series to be created by some former Neversoft members and Vicarious Visions. Brian Bright, former Neversoft member and current project lead, noted that part of the poor sales of Guitar Hero in 2009 was a result of a loss of focus with Guitar Hero 5, stating that [...] "we were trying to please everyone <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think in the end you end up not pleasing any one person a lot". With Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, Bright wanted to bring the game back to please the fans of the earlier Guitar Hero games, specifically the highly successful [...] To that end, the team developed a soundtrack [...] "more focused on rock 'n' roll" [...] than the variety of genres within Guitar Hero 5. The songs are more guitar-centric, as proven to be the most popular instrument choice based on Guitar Hero 5. Bright noted they used player statistics from previous games to shape Warriors of Rock; for example, according to Bright, within a month of release, 40% of the players of Guitar Hero 5 were playing on Expert mode, and felt this was the audience they needed to cater to. Bright also stated that the aim of Warriors of Rock was to create a game with [...] "its own identity" [...] from both previous Guitar Hero titles and other rhythm games; [...] "Rather than go head-to-head with our own games and our competitors, we decided we wanted to make something different." ...|$|E

2500|$|After realizing she had missed, {{she raised}} her arm again, and Oliver Sipple, a former Marine, dived towards her and grabbed her arm, {{possibly}} saving President Ford's life. Sipple said at the time: [...] "I saw [...] pointed <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> grabbed for it. [...] I lunged and grabbed the woman's arm and the gun went off." [...] The bullet from the second shot ricocheted and hit John Ludwig, a 42-year-old taxi driver. Ludwig survived. U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti, still on the bench in 2010, spoke on the record, saying that Moore would have killed President Ford had {{she had her own}} gun, and it was only [...] "because her gun was faulty" [...] that the president's life was spared.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the songs}} {{recorded}} for the album were Parsons and Battin's [...] "Yesterday's Train", a gentle {{meditation on the}} theme of reincarnation; a cover of Lowell George and Bill Payne's [...] "Truck Stop Girl", sung by Clarence White; and a light-hearted reading of Lead Belly's [...] "Take a Whiff on Me". The album also included the Battin-penned [...] "Well Come Back Home", a heartfelt comment on the Vietnam War. Battin explained the song's genesis to author Johnny Rogan during a 1979 interview: [...] "I was personally touched by the Vietnam situation, and my feelings about it came out in that song. I had a high school friend who died <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> guess my thoughts were on him at the time." [...] Battin also revealed in the same interview that he couldn't decide whether to name the song [...] "Well Come Back Home" [...] or [...] "Welcome Back Home" [...] but finally settled on the former. Curiously, although the song was listed on the original album and the original CD issue of (Untitled) as [...] "Well Come Back Home", it was listed as [...] "Welcome Back Home" [...] on the (Untitled)/(Unissued) re-release in 2000, possibly in error. With a running time of 7:40, the song is the longest studio recording in The Byrds' entire oeuvre. In addition, the song also continues the tradition of ending The Byrds' albums on an unusual note, with Battin chanting the Nichiren Buddhist mantra [...] "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo" [...] {{towards the end of the}} song.|$|E

[...] It was Millicent who spoke, with quiet composure, and her {{companion}} wondered at his own lack of feeling. After the first shock of the surprise he was sensible of no particular indignation or emotion. It seemed as if any tenderness that he had once felt for her had long since disappeared. There was little that he cared to tell her; but, prompted by some impulse which may have been mere curiosity, he drew the window open and they passed out upon the balcony.|$|E
6000|$|In {{calling on}} the President the {{following}} day I was a little taken aback by his frankness in speaking of my changing point of view. [...] "You have pictured the reverse side of the pioneer," [...] {{he said with a}} gleam of mischief in his eyes. [...] "In your study of the Indian's case you have discovered the fact that the borderer is often the aggressor and sometimes the thief." [...] He repeated his praise of the book and then said, [...] "I shall make use of your knowledge of the conditions on the Western reservations.

I am not likely ever to marry, and when I have served my full time my pension will be ample for my wants in England; but I shall do my best to help if help is necessary. Fortunately the interest of the thousand apiece the girls were left by my aunt will help your income.

When I met you that night I had just arrived from Melbourne. I had been lucky in some trading speculations I had <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had some bills with me, but no money except what I had tucked in the skin of that portmanteau and a few papers connected with my family at home. When a man lives the roving kind of life I have, he learns to keep all that he cares for under his own hat, and isn't apt to blab to friends. But it got out in some way on the voyage that I had money, and as there was a mixed lot of 'Sydney ducks' and 'ticket of leave men' on board, it seems they hatched a nice little plot to waylay me on the wharf on landing, rob me, and drop me into deep water. To make it seem less suspicious, they associated themselves {{with a lot of}} crimps who were on the lookout for our sailors, who were going ashore that night too. I'd my suspicions that a couple of those men might be waiting for me {{at the end of the}} wharf. I left the ship just a minute or two before the sailors did. Then I met you. That meeting, my lad, was my first step toward salvation. For the two men let you pass with my portmanteau, which they didn't recognize, as I knew they would ME, and supposed you were a stranger, and lay low, waiting for me. I, who went into the gin-mill with the other sailors, was foolish enough to drink, and was drugged and crimped as they were. I hadn't thought of that. A poor devil of a ticket of leave man, about my size, was knocked down for me, and," [...] he added, suppressing a laugh, [...] "will be buried, deeply lamented, in the chancel of Dornton Church. While the row was going on, the skipper, fearing to lose other men, warped out into the stream, and so knew nothing of what happened to me. When they found what they thought was my body, he was willing to identify it in the hope that the crime might be charged to the crimps, and so did the other sailor witnesses. But my brother Bill, who had just arrived here from Callao, where he had been hunting for me, hushed it up to prevent a scandal. All the same, Bill might have known the body wasn't mine, even though he hadn't seen me for years." ...|$|E

I just gasped, I didn’t have a clue that I was going to play - it was a great way of doing it, he didn’t {{give me a chance to}} think about it, I just had to go <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> play! <b>I</b> thought no-one was going to expect too much of me, <b>I</b> just went <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> done my best <b>and</b> <b>I</b> did okay." ...|$|R
