5|$|The snail's <b>oesophageal</b> gland houses {{symbiotic}} gammaproteobacteria {{from which}} the snail appears to obtain its nourishment. This species {{is considered to be}} one of the most peculiar deep-sea hydrothermal-vent gastropods, and it is the only known extant animal that incorporates iron sulfide into its skeleton (into both its sclerites and into its shell as an exoskeleton). Its heart is, proportionately speaking, unusually large for any animal: the heart comprises approximately 4% of its body volume.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Geir H. Haarde {{announced}} on 23 January 2009 {{that he would}} be stepping down as leader of the Independence Party for health reasons: he has been diagnosed as having a malignant <b>oesophageal</b> tumour. He said he would travel to the Netherlands around the end of January for treatment. Education Minister and Independence Party vice-chairman Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir was to serve as Prime Minister in his absence. The leader of the Social Democratic Alliance, Foreign Minister Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir, was also unwell, undergoing treatment for a benign brain tumour since September 2008. The government recommended that elections be held on 9 May 2009.|$|E
25|$|Acute disease {{might include}} infections such as oesophagitis, trauma caused {{ingestion}} of corrosive substances, or rupture of veins such as <b>oesophageal</b> varices, Boerhaave syndrome or Mallory-Weiss tears. Chronic diseases might include congenital {{diseases such as}} Zenker's diverticulum and esophageal webbing, and <b>oesophageal</b> motility disorders including the nutcracker oesophagus, achalasia, diffuse <b>oesophageal</b> spasm, and <b>oesophageal</b> stricture.|$|E
25|$|The risk of <b>oesophageal</b> cancer {{increases}} with 10 or more prescriptions for oral bisphosphonates {{over a five-year}} period. In Europe and North America, the incidence of <b>oesophageal</b> cancer at age 60-79 is typically 1 per 1000 population over five years, and this is estimated to increase to about 2 per 1000 with five years’ use of oral bisphosphonates.|$|E
25|$|These bracken-associated tumours might form a {{model for}} some types of human <b>oesophageal</b> cancer. Human {{papillomavirus}} DNA has been detected in around 18% of squamous cell carcinomas of the oesophagus, {{and there is an}} association between exposure to or consumption of bracken (which is used as a foodstuff and herbal remedy in South America, China, Japan, Korea and other countries) and risk of developing <b>oesophageal</b> cancer.|$|E

25|$|Dilley died in {{a hospice}} in Leicester on 5 October 2011 just one week after being {{diagnosed}} with <b>oesophageal</b> cancer, {{at the age of}} 52. A memorial service was held in Worcester Cathedral on Wednesday 9 November 2011.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oesophageal</b> {{diseases}} {{include a}} spectrum of disorders affecting the oesophagus. The most common condition of the oesophagus in Western countries is gastroesophageal reflux disease, which in chronic forms is thought to result in changes to the epithelium of the oesophagus, known as Barrett's oesophagus.|$|E
25|$|Esophageal lichen planus, {{affecting}} the esophageal mucosa. This can present with difficulty or pain when swallowing due to <b>oesophageal</b> inflammation, {{or as the}} development of an esophageal stricture. It has also been hypothesized that it is a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate may be {{a factor}} for {{heartburn}} in some people because one of its constituents, theobromine, may affect the <b>oesophageal</b> sphincter muscle, hence permitting stomach acidic contents {{to enter into the}} oesophagus. Theobromine is also toxic to some animals unable to metabolize it (see theobromine poisoning).|$|E
25|$|<b>Oesophageal</b> {{disease may}} result in a sore throat, {{throwing}} up blood, difficulty swallowing or vomiting. Chronic or congenital diseases might be investigated using barium swallows, endoscopy and biopsy, whereas acute diseases such as reflux may be investigated and diagnosed based on symptoms and a medical history alone.|$|E
25|$|An EU {{committee}} in 1998 {{reported that there}} was usually clear evidence of tissue damage in the oesophagus of birds which had been gavage fed, although one 1972 study cited by the report observed no alteration of the <b>oesophageal</b> tissue. More recent scientific {{studies have shown that}} the esophagus of birds can be injured or inflamed by gavage feeding.|$|E
25|$|The British Royal Horticultural Society {{recommends}} against {{consumption of}} bracken either by humans or livestock, since it contains carcinogens linked with <b>oesophageal</b> and stomach cancer. However, the poison found in bracken, ptaquiloside, is both water-soluble and is destroyed in heat and alkaline conditions. Despite this, moderation of consumption is still recommended to mitigate chance of throat and stomach cancers.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the most}} likely human route of uptake of CYN is ingestion, oral {{toxicity}} experiments were conducted on mice. The oral LD50 {{was found to be}} 4.4-6.9mg CYN/kg, and in addition to some ulceration of the <b>oesophageal</b> gastric mucosa, symptoms were consistent with that of intraperitoneal dosing. Stomach contents included culture material, which indicated that these LD50 figures might be overestimated.|$|E

25|$|Transoesophageal Doppler {{includes}} two main technologies; transoesophageal echocardiogram —which is primarily used for diagnostic purposes, and <b>oesophageal</b> Doppler monitoring—which is primarily {{used for the}} clinical monitoring of cardiac output. The latter uses continuous wave Doppler to measure blood velocity in the descending thoracic aorta. An ultrasound probe is inserted either orally or nasally into the oesophagus to mid-thoracic level, {{at which point the}} oesophagus lies alongside the descending thoracic aorta. Because the transducer is close to the blood flow, the signal is clear. The probe may require re-focussing to ensure an optimal signal. This method has good validation, is widely used for fluid management during surgery with evidence for improved patient outcome, and has been recommended by the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). <b>Oesophageal</b> Doppler monitoring measures the velocity of blood and not true Q, therefore relies on a nomogram based on patient age, height and weight to convert the measured velocity into stroke volume and cardiac output. This method generally requires patient sedation and is accepted for use in both adults and children.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{liver disease}} rarely results in pain, but {{may result in}} jaundice. Infectious liver disease may cause a fever. Chronic liver disease {{may result in a}} buildup of fluid in the abdomen, {{yellowing}} of the skin or eyes, easy bruising, immunosuppression, and feminsation. Portal hypertension is often present, and this may lead to the development of prominent veins {{in many parts of the}} body, such as <b>oesophageal</b> varices, and haemorrhoids.|$|E
25|$|Vomiting {{is due to}} gastric stasis (large volume vomiting, brief nausea {{relieved}} by vomiting, <b>oesophageal</b> reflux, epigastric fullness, early satiation), besides direct action on the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, the vomiting centre of the brain. Vomiting can thus be prevented by prokinetic agents (e.g. domperidone or metoclopramide). If vomiting has already started, these drugs need to be administered by a non-oral route (e.g. subcutaneous for metoclopramide, rectally for domperidone).|$|E
25|$|Although {{the precise}} {{shape and size}} of the stomach varies widely among {{different}} vertebrates, the relative positions of the <b>oesophageal</b> and duodenal openings remain relatively constant. As a result, the organ always curves somewhat to the left before curving back to meet the pyloric sphincter. However, lampreys, hagfishes, chimaeras, lungfishes, and some teleost fish have no stomach at all, with the oesophagus opening directly into the anus. These animals all consume diets that either require little storage of food, or no pre-digestion with gastric juices, or both.|$|E
25|$|The gastric lining {{is usually}} {{divided into two}} regions, an {{anterior}} portion lined by fundic glands, and a posterior with pyloric glands. Cardiac glands are unique to mammals, and even then are absent {{in a number of}} species. The distributions of these glands vary between species, and do not always correspond with the same regions as in humans. Furthermore, in many non-human mammals, a portion of the stomach anterior to the cardiac glands is lined with epithelium essentially identical to that of the oesophagus. Ruminants, in particular, have a complex stomach, the first three chambers of which are all lined with <b>oesophageal</b> mucosa.|$|E
25|$|Dutch Tilders (29 August 194123 April 2011), born Mattheus Frederikus Wilhelmus Tilders, anglicised as Matthew Tilders, was a Netherlands-born Australian blues singer-songwriter and guitarist.

He has toured with John Mayall (1974), Brownie McGhee (1976, 1980s), and Taj Mahal (1986, 1990s). Tilders was diagnosed with <b>oesophageal</b> and liver cancer in May 2010 and died on 23 April 2011, aged 69. In May 2012 Australian Guitar magazine listed him in the top40 on their Definitive Australian Guitarists of All Time.|$|E
25|$|According to the Centers for Disease Control, ingesting paraquat causes {{symptoms}} such as liver, lung, heart, {{and kidney}} failure within several days to several weeks {{that can lead to}} death up to 30 days after ingestion. Those who suffer large exposures are unlikely to survive. Chronic exposure can lead to lung damage, kidney failure, heart failure, and <b>oesophageal</b> strictures. Accidental deaths and suicides from paraquat ingestion are relatively common. For example, there have been 18 deaths in Australia from paraquat poisoning since 2000. Long-term exposures to paraquat would most likely cause lung and eye damage, but reproductive/fertility damage was not found by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in their review.|$|E
25|$|Reported toxicities include {{dry mouth}} (xerostomia) from salivary gland damage, 18% (grade 2); {{difficulty}} swallowing (dysphagia) from {{damage to the}} constrictor muscles, larynx and <b>oesophageal</b> sphincter, 15% (grade 2); subclinical aspiration up to 50% (reported incidence of aspiration pneumonia approximately 14%); hypothyroidism 28–38% at three years (may be up to 55% depending on amount of the thyroid gland exposed to over 45Gy radiation; esophageal stenosis 5%; osteonecrosis of the mandible 2.5%; and need for a gastrostomy tube to be placed {{at some point during}} or up to one year after treatment 4% (up to 16% with longer follow up). Concerns have been expressed regarding excessive short and long term toxicity, especially dysphagia and xerostomia, and hence whether standard doses expose patients with better prognoses are being exposed to overtreatment and unnecessary side effects.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} {{digestive}} system, a bolus (a small rounded mass of chewed up food) enters the stomach through the oesophagus via the lower <b>oesophageal</b> sphincter. The stomach releases proteases (protein-digesting enzymes such as pepsin) and hydrochloric acid, which kills or inhibits bacteria {{and provides the}} acidic pH of 2 for the proteases to work. Food is churned by the stomach through muscular contractions of the wall called peristalsis – reducing {{the volume of the}} fundus, before looping around the fundus and the body of stomach as the boluses are converted into chyme (partially digested food). Chyme slowly passes through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum of the small intestine, where the extraction of nutrients begins. Depending on the quantity and contents of the meal, the stomach will digest the food into chyme within anywhere between forty minutes and a few hours. The average human stomach can comfortably hold about a litre of food.|$|E

500|$|At the {{memorial}} service for John Betjeman, who died in July 1984, Larkin {{was asked if he}} would accept the post of Poet Laureate. He declined, not least because he felt he had long since ceased to be a writer of poetry in a meaningful sense. The following year Larkin began to suffer from <b>oesophageal</b> cancer. On 11 June 1985 he underwent surgery, but his cancer was found to have spread and was inoperable. On 28 November he collapsed and was readmitted to hospital. He died four days later, on 2 December 1985, at the age of 63, and was buried at the Cottingham municipal cemetery near Hull.

500|$|The gastro-esophageal {{junction}} (also {{known as}} the esophagogastric junction) is the junction between the esophagus and the stomach, {{at the lower end}} of the esophagus. The pink color of the esophageal mucosa contrasts to the deeper red of the gastric mucosa, and the mucosal transition can be seen as an irregular zig-zag line, which is often called the z-line. [...] Histological examination reveals abrupt transition between the stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus and the simple columnar epithelium of the stomach. Normally, the cardia of the stomach is immediately distal to the z-line and the z-line coincides with the upper limit of the gastric folds of the cardia; however, when the anatomy of the mucosa is distorted in Barrets esophagus the true gastro-eshophageal junction can be identified by the upper limit of the gastric folds rather than the mucosal transition. The functional location of the lower <b>oesophageal</b> sphincter is generally situated about [...] below the z-line.|$|E
2500|$|Dysphagia is an {{impaired}} {{ability to}} swallow, {{which in the}} case of PD is probably related to an inability to initiate the swallowing reflex or by a too long laryngeal or <b>oesophageal</b> movement. [...] It can lead to aspiration pneumonia.|$|E
