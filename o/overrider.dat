50|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} how often multiple dispatch is used in practice, Muschevici et al. studied programs that use dynamic dispatch. They analyzed nine applications, mostly compilers, written in six different languages: Common Lisp Object System, Dylan, Cecil, MultiJava, Diesel, and Nice. Their results show that 13-32% of generic functions use the dynamic type of one argument, while 2.7-6.5% of them use the dynamic type of multiple arguments. The remaining 65-93% of generic functions have one concrete method (<b>overrider),</b> and thus are not considered to use the dynamic types of their arguments. Further, the study reports that 2-20% of generic functions had two and 3-6% had three concrete function implementations. The numbers decrease rapidly for functions with more concrete overriders.|$|E
50|$|In 1973, Carbodies' owner BSA, by now confronting {{imminent}} bankruptcy, {{was bought}} by Manganese Bronze Holdings, who were happy to continue making the FX4. Detail changes, such as burst-proof door locks and push-button door handles, safety steering and moulded rubber <b>overriders</b> (designed because the original tooling for the chrome <b>overriders</b> had worn out) were implemented.|$|R

40|$|An {{apparently}} {{increasing number}} of philosophers take free will skepticism to pose a serious challenge {{to some of our}} practices. This must seem odd to many—why should anyone think that free will skepticism is relevant for our practices, when nobody seems to think that other canonical forms of philosophical skepticism (for example, skepticism about induction or other minds) are relevant for our practices? Part of the explanation may be epistemic, but here I focus on a metaethical explanation. Free will skepticism is special because it is compatible with ‘basic moral reasons’—moral reasons acknowledged by all mainstream ethicists—and other minds and induction skepticism are not. One example is our reason not to intentionally harm others. Practical seriousness about other minds and induction skepticism undermines this reason, but practical seriousness about free will skepticism only undermines a potential <b>overrider</b> of this reason, that is, the reason of retributio...|$|E
50|$|The Caprice was {{visually}} distinctive with {{a specific}} radiator grille, Cadillac-style front bumper <b>overriders,</b> lavish fluted hubcaps, whitewall tyres, and a bonnet ornament borrowed from the Chevrolet Caprice.|$|R
50|$|The deluxe version had a heater, leather seat facings, carpets {{replacing}} the standard rubber matting, armrests on the doors, twin-tone horns, a passenger sun visor, and some extra chrome, including <b>overriders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Viewed {{from the}} outside, the Wolseley 16/60 was {{differentiated}} from the 15/60 by the <b>overriders</b> on the bumpers which protruded more {{than on the}} earlier car: the plastic mouldings on the rear lights were also modified along with the rear fins, now much reduced in their sharpness.|$|R
50|$|Introduced for the 1974 model year, the 710 {{only saw}} very light {{modifications}} for 1975. The steering was adjusted to decrease driver effort, while noise levels were reduced, and gear ratios were adjusted to boost gas mileage. Externally, the bumper <b>overriders</b> received a slight chrome molding in the middle.|$|R
50|$|The NE three-door Sports and five-door Superwagon added {{a limited}} slip differential, front bumper <b>overriders,</b> spare wheel cover, side pin striping, 16-inch chrome wheels, and {{optional}} two-tone paint over the base cars. The most expensive models also received an inclinometer, volt meter, oil pressure gauge, stereo cassette player, remote fuel filler release, suspension driver's seat, carpeting, and tweed and velour cloth trim (over tweed cloth and vinyl).|$|R
50|$|The same car {{was also}} sold in Europe. One Europe-only variant was the Anglia Sportsman, which carried its spare tyre on the back, {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} continental kit often seen in the United States. Chrome bumper <b>overriders,</b> broad whitewall tyres, and optionally a side stripe kicking {{up at the end}} into the tail-lights/fin were also fitted. The Super only arrived in South Africa in 1966, although it did boost sales considerably.|$|R
5000|$|A GS Rally Pack {{was fitted}} as {{standard}} equipment on the Falcon GS Hardtop [...] and was available as an option on Falcon 500 Sedan and Wagon, Fairmont Sedan and Wagon, Falcon Utility and Van [...] and on Falcon 500 Utility and Van. The pack included special paint treatment, bonnet scoops, bumper <b>overriders,</b> slotted steel wheels, enhanced instrumentation, a sports steering wheel and long range driving lights. The driving lights were not included when the pack was fitted to Fairmont models.|$|R
50|$|The {{upgraded}} Mk II, {{introduced in}} October 1963, had Selectaride rear dampers and minor styling changes. Changes on the Mk III, {{the final version}} of the series which was introduced in June 1965, included a minor reduction in overall length, deeper windscreen, equal size headlamps without chrome bezels, improved interior ventilation, wood-veneer dashboard, the addition of <b>overriders</b> to the bumpers, and a dual-circuit braking system. 104/2308, the blue car illustrated in this article is a mildly modified Mark Two which left the factory in May, 1965.|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} was significantly revised including a widened track, softer torsion bars {{and the addition}} of a unique Z-configuration equalizing torsion spring. On US, UK and Ireland models, the generator output was increased from 180 to 360 watts, and the entire electrical system was upgraded from 6 volts to 12 volts. The clutch disc also increased in size and changes were made to the flywheel. New equipment included a driver's armrest on the door and locking buttons on both doors. Safety improvements included two-speed windscreen wipers, reversing lights (in some markets), and a driver's side mirror. In accord with the newly enacted US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, North American models received a dual-circuit brake system, the clear glass headlamp covers were deleted; the headlamps were brought forward to {{the leading edge of the}} front fenders, and the sealed-beam units were exposed and surrounded by chrome bezels. (Throughout the rest of the world markets the 1967 model sold in Europe et.al. still retained the older headlights (including its counterparts in Latin America - especially the Brasilian market model retaining the pre-1965 bodystyle). Another oddity of the 1967 North American market Beetle is the rear bumper <b>overriders</b> (towel rails) - the <b>overriders</b> have a different shape unlike the older models besides the one-year only engine decklid.|$|R
5000|$|Released in 1961 as more luxurious {{versions}} of the Mini, both the Wolseley Hornet and the Riley Elf had longer, slightly finned rear wings and larger boots that gave the cars a more traditional three-box design.Wheelbase of the Elf and Hornet remained at 2.036 m, whereas the overall length was increased to 3.27 m. This resulted in a dry weight of 638 kg/642.3 kg (rubber/hydrolastic suspension) for the Elf and 618 kg/636.4 kg for the Hornet.Front-end treatment, which incorporated each marque's traditional upright grille design (the Hornet's grille with a lit [...] "Wolseley" [...] badge), also contributed to a less utilitarian appearance. The cars had larger-diameter chrome hubcaps than the Austin and Morris Minis, and additional chrome accents, bumper <b>overriders</b> and wood-veneer dashboards. The Riley was the more expensive of the two cars. [...] The name [...] "Wolseley Hornet" [...] was first used on 1930s saloon, coupé, sports and racing cars, while the name [...] "Elf" [...] recalled the Riley Sprite and Imp sports cars, also of the 1930s (Riley's first choice of name [...] "Imp" [...] {{could not be used}} as Hillman had registered it). The full-width dashboard was a differentiator between the Elf and Hornet. This dashboard was the idea of Christopher Milner the Sales Manager for Riley.Both the Riley Elf's and Wolseley Hornet's bodies were built at Fisher & Ludlow under their [...] "Fisholow" [...] brandname. Plates in the engine compartment on the right side fitch plate bear evidence of this speciality.Very early Mark I {{versions of}} both cars (e.g. press photo of 445MWL) had no <b>overriders</b> on the bumpers and a single piece front wing (A-panel and wing in one piece, no outside seam below scuttle panel) that was soon given up again, allegedly due to cost. The Elf's and Hornet's special bumper <b>overriders</b> first appeared in 1962.Early production Mark I's also had a combination of leather and cloth seats (Elf R-A2S1-101 to FR2333, Hornet W-A2S1-101 to FW2105) whereas all later models had full leather seats. [...] Mark I models were equipped with single leading shoe brakes on the front.|$|R
50|$|For 1973, federal crash {{regulations}} mandated the fitment of 5-mph bumpers to {{the front}} of all vehicles for sale in the United States. While a number of vehicles saw a major redesign to meet the regulation, the Continental met the mandate by moving its front bumper several inches forward and fitting it with rubber-tipped impact <b>overriders.</b> In the rear, the rear bumper is reinforced, moving it rearward; it was given a 2 1/2 mph rating. As a counterpart to the Continental Town Car, a two-door Continental Town Coupe was introduced; both models were sold exclusively with a padded vinyl top.|$|R
5000|$|Along with trim differences, {{such as a}} {{different}} grille without {{a dip in the}} lower middle part, bumper <b>overriders</b> meant that the 1100 was also 35 mm longer than its predecessor. Somehow the weight dropped by 40 kilos, to 800 kg. The 1100 was also available with a floor-mounted shifter, unlike the 1000 and later 1200. Originally available in Standard or DeLuxe trims, a Sporty DeLuxe version joined the lineup soon after its introduction. This also formed the basis for the Colt 1500 SS. The Colt 1100 was replaced by the [...] "New Colt" [...] 1200 in 1968.|$|R
5000|$|In 1974, Alfa Romeo {{launched}} a more upscale model, the Alfasud SE. The SE {{was replaced by}} the Alfasud L (Lusso) model introduced at the Bruxelles Motor Show in January 1975. Recognizable by its bumper <b>overriders</b> and chrome strips on the door sills and on the tail, the Lusso was better appointed than the standard Alfasud (which was now called [...] "normale"), with such features as cloth upholstery, headrests, padded dashboard with glove compartment and optional tachometer. A three-door estate model called the Alfasud Giardinetta was introduced in May 1975, with the same equipment of the Alfasud [...] "L".|$|R
5000|$|The XK140 was {{introduced}} in late 1954 and sold as a 1955 model. Exterior changes that distinguished it from the XK120 included more substantial front and rear bumpers with <b>overriders,</b> and flashing turn signals (operated by a switch on the dash) above the front bumper.The grille remained the same size but became a one-piece cast unit with fewer, and broader, vertical bars. The Jaguar badge was incorporated into the grille surround. A chrome trim strip ran along {{the centre of the}} bonnet (hood) and boot (trunk) lid. An emblem on the boot lid contained the words [...] "Winner Le Mans 1951-3".|$|R
25|$|The {{production}} {{versions of}} the Friskysport and Frisky Coupe were very similar and used identical chassis, but there are differences to the bodywork. Early {{versions of the}} Friskysport are fitted with a separate chrome Reliant Sabre windscreen frame, they have a detachable tail section and dummy air intake scoops just behind the doors whilst later cars have the same lower body as the Coupe. The Friskysport has <b>overriders,</b> whilst the Coupe has plain bumpers. The Coupe initially used the Friskysport body with an integral, glassed-on roof and steel framed front windscreen, until the Family Three one-piece body became available in 1959, which was then used for both cars.|$|R
5000|$|An unusual {{development}} was {{the installation of}} the European market 1-litre [...] "EJ" [...] engine in the Mira Gino 1000, presented in August 2002. This version no longer fit into the Kei class because of its larger engine, and was also marginally longer and wider due to the installation of bumper <b>overriders</b> and fender trim. The bigger engine produced , the same as a turbocharged 660 cc engine, but offered considerably more power at lower engine speeds. 1,290 of the Gino 1000 had been built when production of the first generation came to an end in June 2004. The Gino 1000 was effectively replaced by the 1-litre Daihatsu Boon.|$|R
50|$|Production {{commenced}} in September 1957, {{with the}} model being announced as the Thames 400E series. A bold Thames nameplate {{appeared on the}} front beneath which was a circular emblem containing the appropriate figure identifying the vehicle's capacity class. The new model quickly met with widespread approval, and passenger transport use was soon being catered for with the availability of an 8/10 seater estate car derivative, and a 12-seat minibus based on the 15 cwt model. The success of the estate car variant was such that it later became available in a De Luxe configuration, complete with chrome plated <b>overriders</b> for its front bumper, chrome side mouldings and window trims, and dual exterior mirrors.|$|R
40|$|Taking the {{inspiration}} from some points made by Scott Sturgeon and Albert Casullo, I articulate a view {{according to which}} an important difference between undermining and overriding defeaters is that the former require the subject to engage in some higher-order epistemic thinking, while the latter don’t. With {{the help of some}} examples, I argue that underminers push the cognizer to reflect on the way she formed a belief by challenging the epistemic worthiness of either the source of justification or the specific justificatory process. By contrast, <b>overriders</b> needn’t pose any such challenge. I also consider some problems for the proposed view, and I put forward some possible solutions. Finally, I provide some details on how undermining defeat works in different cases...|$|R
50|$|The Series 2 1750 GTV of 1970 {{introduced}} other mechanical changes, {{including a}} dual circuit braking system (split front and rear, with separate servos). The brake and clutch pedals on {{left hand drive}} cars were also of an improved pendant design, instead of the earlier floor-hinged type. On right hand drive cars the floor-hinged pedals were retained, as there was no space for the pedal box behind the carburettors. Externally, the series 2 1750 GTV is identified by new, slimmer bumpers with front and rear <b>overriders.</b> The combined front indicator and sidelight units were now mounted to the front panel instead of the front bumper, except again on the 1971-72 US/Canadian market cars. The interior was slightly modified, with the seats retaining the same basic outline but following a simpler design.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1970 the 600R appeared. The {{external}} {{differences were}} limited to trim, but the interior saw more thorough changes, with a new steering wheel, inner ceiling, and seat coverings. The hubcaps were replaced with tiny rubber caps. The 767 cc 36 hp (SAE) 600 R (thanks to higher compression than the E) was in turn replaced by the 32 hp (DIN) 843 cc (65.0 x 63.5 mm) 600 S in July 1977, a version featuring new bumpers with rubber <b>overriders</b> and a black plastic faux-grille to replace the previous chrome iteration. Top speed was up from 105 to 110 km/h. The 600 was finally replaced by the new 147 in April 1982, after having undergone one last tiny facelift in 1981 (black head and taillight surrounds, a black [...] "shield" [...] up front).|$|R
2500|$|The Mark E Tourer was {{eventually}} {{put on the}} market in December 1957 alongside the Mark D.

2500|$|To commemorate its {{passing the}} Ford Model T's record sales mark and its {{victories}} in the Baja 1000 Mexican races from 1967 to 1971, Volkswagen produced its first limited-edition Beetle. It was marketed as the [...] "Baja Champion SE" [...] in the United States and the [...] "Marathon" [...] Superbeetle {{in the rest of}} the world. It featured unique [...] "Marathon Blau" [...] metallic blue paint, steel-pressed 10-spoke 15-inch (38cm) magnesium-alloy wheels, a commemorative metal plate mounted on the glovebox and a certificate of authenticity presented to the original purchaser. Dealer-installed options for this limited-edition Superbeetle included the following: white stripes running the length of the rocker-panel, a special shifter knob, bumper <b>overriders,</b> tapered exhaust tips, fake walnut inserts in the dashboard (behind the steering wheel and the glovebox cover) as well as Bosch fog lights mounted on the front bumper.|$|R

Rather than widen the entire car to retain the flat sides of the prototype, the extra track width was accommodated by making the bottom part of the rear wings flair outwards. The rear wheels were also moved forward by approximately 12 in. Inside the car, there were changes to the shape of the fibreglass dashboard and the engine was upgraded to the Villiers 9E/4S with four-speed gearbox.

5000|$|Manufacturing {{continued}} in Nigeria and Kenya until 2006, utilising the Peugeot knock down kits. Kenya production was 27,000 units {{and the car}} remained on sale to 2007, being described as [...] "King of the African road". Egypt also had its own production facilities. In South Africa it was built by PACSA (Peugeot and Citroën South Africa) alongside the 404 until late 1978. Sigma Motor Corporation took over from PACSA in early 1979 and moved 504 production to their [...] "Sigma Park" [...] plant east of Pretoria. South Africa received the two-liter and TI versions until mid-1976 when the lower priced 1800 L version was added. The L has a matt black grille and window surrounds, and did not receive bumper <b>overriders.</b> A similarly equipped L Wagon had arrived earlier in the year, to replace the discontinued 404 Wagon.|$|R

5000|$|In early {{catalogues}} of {{the range}} a de luxe version of the 15 cwt estate car was shown complete with chrome <b>overriders</b> to the front bumpers, chrome exterior mouldings, chrome window trims and a two tone colour scheme. Two exterior mirrors were fitted {{as well as more}} luxurious interior trim and fittings. Whether because of the higher rate of purchase tax which was current at the time, or for some other reason, very few of the de luxe estate cars appear to have been sold in Britain. In fact it was not long before the estate car was dropped in favour of the largercapacity 12 seat bus, this being listed as from September 1958. This 12 seater did not attract purchase tax, the Government thinking behind this probably assuming that no one would buy a 12¬seater in place of a private car, unless he had about 10 children! ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{original}} design brief the GAZ-24 was to be retired by 1978, and though by that time work on a successor (the GAZ-3102) was underway, {{it was clear that}} the car would have to soldier on the conveyor for a foreseeable future. In 1977, following a 1976 report by NAMI on the Volga's major shortcomings (problematic steering prime among them), GAZ refused to update the GAZ-24's front suspension, instead making only cosmetic changes. (The front suspension would be unchanged until 2003, when the kingpins were changed to sealed ball joints, while the rear got an antiroll bar.) Visually, these Volgas can be identified by front and rear bumper <b>overriders,</b> front fog lights and rear reflectors integrated into a single block. Inside the car gained retractable seat belts, a new dashboard where all exposed metal elements were covered by plastic. In this final shape the car was produced until 1986, the estate until 1987. Including the GAZ-24-10, almost one and a half million such Volgas were produced.|$|R
5000|$|In Australia, the CB {{series was}} {{launched}} in December 1978. It was available as a four-door sedan in three trim levels (Standard, Deluxe and Super Deluxe) and as a two-door Super Deluxe hardtop. The engine was the 2.0-liter [...] inline-four engine available with three transmissions (four-speed and five-speed manual or three-speed automatic). The Deluxe model added cloth-inserted seats, push button radio, bumper rubber inserts, rubber body side protection mouldings, intermittent wipers, chrome wheel rings, map reading lights, and seat back map pockets. The Super Deluxe added halogen headlamps, window tint, FM radio, bumper <b>overriders,</b> and electronic safety check panel. For the facelift model from 1980 in Australia, the base [...] "Standard" [...] model was renamed [...] "Special", while the sedan and hardtop Super Deluxe trims each receiving unique (to trim level and body variant) wheel trims. A rear folding armrest, central locking and sunroof {{were added to the}} Super Deluxe sedan. Another minor update in 1981 changed the wheel designs for the Super Deluxe.|$|R
2500|$|The Mark III, {{introduced}} in March 1967, {{was the first}} major facelift to the Spitfire. The front bumper was raised in response to new crash regulations, as well as the front coil springs being slightly raised, which made the car sometimes look a little out of proportion. Although much of the bonnet pressing was carried over, the front end looked quite different. The rear lost the <b>overriders</b> from the bumper but gained reversing lights as standard (initially as two separate lights {{on either side of the}} number plate, latterly as a single light in a new unit above the number plate); the interior was improved again with a wood-veneer instrument surround and a smaller 15-inch wire spoked steering wheel. A folding hood replaced the earlier [...] "build it yourself" [...] arrangement. For most of the Mark III range, the instrument cluster was still centre-mounted (as in the Mark I and Mark II) so as to reduce parts bin counts (and thereby production costs) for right-hand and left-hand drive versions.|$|R
