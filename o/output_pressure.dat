5000|$|A {{pressure}} regulator's {{primary function}} is to match the flow of gas through the regulator to the demand for gas placed upon it, whilst maintaining a constant <b>output</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since the <b>output</b> <b>pressure</b> of a {{centrifugal}} pump {{varies with the}} square of the speed, pressure can be controlled accurately by controlling the speed of the pump. For example: a pump runs at 1785 RPM during shutoff with an <b>output</b> <b>pressure</b> of 204 PSI and a suction pressure of 0 PSI. If the speed of the motor is reduced by 10% to 1607 RPM, the new <b>output</b> <b>pressure</b> becomes 165 PSI. This in turn enables the Variable Speed Controller to maintain a perfectly flat pump discharge curve until the full rating of the pump is reached. Further, the variable speed controller adjusts for varying suction pressure - as in the following example: a city water supply of 65 PSI drops to 26 PSI while flowing. The variable speed drive will speed up to adjust for the sudden drop in pressure and slow down again when it is not needed - all the while maintaining a constant total discharge pressure.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{example is}} where spring load applies a {{reducing}} force {{so that the}} <b>output</b> <b>pressure</b> is reduced. Proportioning valves are frequently used in cars to reduce the brake fluid pressure to the rear brakes.|$|E
40|$|Portable {{compressed}} air supply has two or more <b>outputs</b> at <b>pressures</b> from 20 to 100 psi. Applications include operating production equipment, spraying paint and lubricants, and pressurizing refrigeration systems. Supply filters air from standard high-pressure line, reduces it to working pressure, and adds lubricant when required. Regulator supplies low-pressure air to output channels. On channel lines, vernier-control valves select <b>output</b> <b>pressures...</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{double-acting}} single-rod cylinders, {{when the}} input and <b>output</b> <b>pressures</b> are reversed, {{there is a}} force {{difference between the two}} sides of the piston due to one side of the piston being covered by the rod attached to it. The cylinder rod reduces the surface area of the piston and reduces the force that can be applied for the retraction stroke.|$|R
2500|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} use {{a rotating}} disk or impeller in a shaped housing {{to force the}} gas to {{the rim of the}} impeller, increasing the velocity of the gas. A diffuser (divergent duct) section converts the velocity energy to pressure energy. They are primarily used for continuous, stationary service in industries such as oil refineries, chemical and petrochemical plants and natural gas processing plants. Their application can be from [...] to thousands of horsepower. With multiple staging, they can achieve high <b>output</b> <b>pressures</b> greater than [...]|$|R
5000|$|The VFS can be {{designed}} such {{that any of these}} forces act in either axial direction. If the magnetic force acts opposes the pressure force, then increasing current through the solenoid coil will, at steady-state, cause an increase in VFS <b>output</b> <b>pressure.</b> This is commonly called a [...] "proportional" [...] VFS since controlled <b>output</b> <b>pressure</b> increases with controlled current. In the absence of current, this design produces low pressure, so it can also be called a [...] "normally low" [...] solenoid. If magnetic force acts {{in the same direction as}} the pressure force, then increasing current will cause a decrease in controlled pressure. This can be called an [...] "inversely proportional" [...] or [...] "normally high" [...] solenoid.|$|E
50|$|Different {{types of}} nozzles are {{available}} for different applications. Some nozzles create a water jet that is in a triangular plane (fan pattern), others emit a thin jet of water that spirals around rapidly (cone pattern). Nozzles that deliver a higher flow rate lower the <b>output</b> <b>pressure.</b> Most nozzles attach directly to the trigger gun.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pressure}} regulator is {{a control valve}} that reduces the input pressure of a fluid to a desired value at its output. Regulators are used for gases and liquids, and can be an integral device with an <b>output</b> <b>pressure</b> setting, a restrictor and a sensor all in the one body, or consist of a separate pressure sensor, controller and flow valve.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe present {{paper is}} based on the {{sensitivity}} analysis of input and <b>output</b> <b>pressures</b> and flows of a pipeline for the detection and location of a blockage in a pipeline. To that end, three ways of modeling a blockage in a pipe have been designed. The first model assumes that the blockage is punctual like an orifice plate placed online in the pipeline. For the second and third model, a longitudinal blockage is assumed along the pipeline. In the second model, it is only considered a reduction of the pipeline cross-section in a particular stretch of the pipeline. In the third model, the blocked segment is modeled by considering two orifice plates and between the plates there is a blocked pipe stretch. These models have four different <b>outputs,</b> <b>pressure</b> and flow rate at the input and pressure and flow rate at the output. The aim of this work is to determine which pair of outputs have the highest sensitivity to the change of blockage position in order to improve the detection and location of the blockage. In this study, the energy for each output and for each position is calculated and the magnitude of the energy variation with respect to blockage position is then obtained. Numerical simulations are presented for the different models...|$|R

50|$|This type of {{compressor}} has no {{moving parts}} and is compact. With electrochemical compression of hydrogen a pressure of 5000 psi (344 bar) is achieved. Pressure {{is believed to}} go beyond 10,000 psi (689 bar) to the structural limits of the design. Water vapor partial pressure, current density, operating temperature and hydrogen back diffusion due to the pressure gradient {{have an effect on}} the maximum <b>output</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
50|$|Boosters may {{be driven}} by an {{electric}} motor, hydraulics, low or high pressure air or manually by a lever system. Those powered by compressed air are usually linear actuated systems, where a pneumatic cylinder directly drives the compression piston, often in a common housing, separated by a seal. A high pressure pneumatic drive arrangement may use the same pressure as the <b>output</b> <b>pressure</b> to drive the piston, and a low pressure drive will use a larger diameter piston to multiply the applied force.|$|E
50|$|Additionally {{inductive}} pumps {{may also}} be connected in series to approximately double the pressure while not increasing the volume. They {{may also be}} connected in parallel to approximately double the volume while not increasing the pressure. Most positive displacement pumps cannot increase <b>output</b> <b>pressure</b> when placed in series as they both stop when they reach their max operating pressure. The inductive pumps add to each other due to the zero differential seen on the second pump from the first pump.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} a system is governed by {{multiple}} criteria, one being cost. If the benefit is fixed, the least cost design results in maximum benefit. However, the least cost approach normally results in a minimum capacity for a water supply network. A minimum cost model usually searches for the least cost solution (in pipe sizes), while satisfying the hydraulic constraints such as: required <b>output</b> <b>pressures,</b> maximum pipe flow rate and pipe flow velocities. The cost {{is a function of}} pipe diameters; therefore the optimization problem consists of finding a minimum cost solution by optimising pipe sizes to provide the minimum acceptable capacity.|$|R

This {{is stored in}} compressed-air cylinders that have a maximum filling pressure of 300 bar and built-in pressure gauges that indicate the current pressure level in the cylinder. The air for actual shooting is drawn from the compressed-air storage cylinder and reduced by a reduction valve into a secondary or <b>output</b> <b>pressure</b> chamber to the rifles working pressure of about 72 bar for staying within the 7.5 joule muzzle energy limit.|$|E
5000|$|Small spherical [...] "point-source" [...] {{acoustic}} devices follow the known inverse square law, which predicts {{the loss of}} 6 decibels (dB) per doubling of distance from the source, solely due to geometric spreading. Large speakers (or large arrays), such as these, have an interference pattern in the nearfield which produces peaks 6 dB higher than the <b>output</b> <b>pressure</b> and nulls where the pressure is essentially zero. The larger the speaker, and the higher the frequency, the longer the effective nearfield. The nearfield for this device is approximately 8 m.|$|E
50|$|Valves require little {{pressure}} to operate and usually {{double or triple}} the input force. The larger {{the size of the}} piston, the larger the <b>output</b> <b>pressure</b> can be. Having a larger piston can also be good if air supply is low, allowing the same forces with less input. These pressures are large enough to crush objects in the pipe. On 100 kPa input, you could lift a small car (upwards of 1,000 lbs) easily, and this is only a basic, small pneumatic valve. However, the resulting forces required of the stem would be too great and cause the valve stem to fail.|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Capacitive micromachined {{ultrasonic}} transducers (CMUTs) have great potential {{to compete with}} piezoelectric transducers in high-power applications. As the <b>output</b> <b>pressures</b> increase, nonlinearity of CMUT must be reconsidered and optimization is required to reduce harmonic distortions. In this paper, we describe a design approach in which uncollapsed CMUT array elements are sized so as to operate at the maximum radiation impedance and have gap heights such that the generated electrostatic force can sustain a plate displacement with full swing at the given drive amplitude. The proposed design enables high <b>output</b> <b>pressures</b> and low harmonic distortions at the output. An equivalent circuit model of the array is used that accurately simulates the uncollapsed mode of operation. The model facilities the design of CMUT parameters for high-pressure output, without the intensive need for computationally involved FEM tools. The optimized design requires a relatively thick plate compared with a conventional CMUT plate. Thus, we used a silicon wafer as the CMUT plate. The fabrication process involves an anodic bonding process for bonding the silicon plate with the glass substrate. To eliminate the bias voltage, which may cause charging problems, the CMUT array is driven with large continuous wave signals at half of the resonant frequency. The fabricated arrays are tested in an oil tank by applying a 125 -V peak 5 -cycle burst sinusoidal signal at 1. 44 MHz. The applied voltage is increased until the plate is about {{to touch the bottom}} electrode to get the maximum peak displacement. The observed pressure is about 1. 8 MPa with â 28 dBc second harmonic at the surface of the array...|$|R
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was fuel starvation resulting from the captain's decision not to follow approved fuel crossfeed procedures. Different <b>output</b> <b>pressure</b> settings on the fuel boost pumps coupled with the open crossfeed valve resulted in both engines drawing fuel from the left tank. All of the fuel from the airplane's left tank that was not used by the engines was transferred into the right tank due to the pressure differential between the boost pumps. During the airplane's descent to landing, the fuel in the left fuel tank became exhausted. Both engine-driven fuel pumps drew air from the exhausted left tank into the fuel system, resulting in a dual-engine flameout.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{process called}} "piping", which often occurs in water-retaining {{structures}} (earth-dams, dykes, levees), involving {{the formation and}} progression of a continuous tunnel between the upstream and downstream sides, {{is one of the}} main cause of structure failure. Starting with the diphasic flow volume equations and the jump equations including the erosion processes, a simplified one-dimensional model for two-phase piping flow erosion was developed. The numerical simulation based on constant input and <b>output</b> <b>pressures</b> showed that the particle concentration can be a significant factor at the very beginning of the process, resulting in the enlargement of the hole at the exit.

40|$|This work proposes an {{experimental}} method for direct measurement of transfer functions of acoustic tubes. The method obtains a pressure-to-velocity transfer function from measurement of input volume velocity and <b>output</b> <b>pressures</b> {{of a target}} tube. Steady sinusoidal waves from 100 Hz to 5 kHz with a 10 -Hz increment were used as a source signal. Experimental results compared with transmission line simu-lations indicate the following: (1) transfer functions obtained from the measurements agree well with those from transmis-sion line simulations; (2) differences between the resonant frequencies obtained from the measurements and simulations with a uniform tube are less than 2. 6 %.

50|$|A {{sequential}} turbo {{can also}} be of use to a system where the <b>output</b> <b>pressure</b> must be greater than can be provided by a single turbo, commonly called a staged twin turbo system. In this case, multiple similarly sized turbochargers are used in sequence, but both operate constantly. The first turbo boosts pressure {{as much as possible}} (for example to three times the intake pressure). Subsequent turbos take the charge from the previous stage and compresses it further (for example to an additional three times intake pressure, for a total boost of nine times atmospheric pressure). This configuration is commonly found on piston engine aircraft which usually do not need to rapidly raise and lower engine speed (and thus where turbo lag is not a primary design consideration), and where the intake pressure is quite low due to low atmospheric pressure at altitude, requiring a very high pressure ratio. High-performance diesel engines also sometimes use this configuration, since diesel engines do not suffer from pre-ignition issues and can use significantly higher boost pressure than Otto cycle engines.|$|E
50|$|There {{are very}} few {{mechanical}} losses compared to piston pumps and other technologies {{because there are no}} mechanical linkages to the piston from outside power sources. The inductive pump piston is driven directly by the magnetic field formed within the body structure about the bore and within the piston. There are minimal friction losses between the piston and bore due to a circumferential magnetic field that pulls the piston equally in all directions towards the wall of the bore. The resulting force is more axial along the path of the piston creating <b>output</b> <b>pressure.</b> Most other pumps use different types of gear reduction mechanisms to slow the rotation of the motor down when driving the piston. These linkages result in significant energy losses in addition to the inefficiencies of the motor. Inductive pumps use various proprietary coatings to reduce friction drag and increase efficiency. Specific models of inductive pumps incorporate a seal less ceramic interface with matching ceramic bore and piston interfaces ground to close tolerances that do not require use of elastic seals. Ceramic interfaces are inert to extremely caustic acids, alkalis, and solvents used industrially.|$|E
50|$|In 1926 Le Prieur and Fernez {{introduced}} {{their new}} free-swimming diving gear. Instead {{of the long}} tube to the surface, it had an air tank worn on the divers back which supplied a continuous flow of air to the Fernez mouthpiece. The pressure is adjustable by hand through a pressure regulator designed by Le Prieur, {{and there are two}} pressure gauges, one for tank pressure and one for <b>output</b> <b>pressure.</b> It is the first practical system of self-immersion which frees the diver from all ties with the surface. This equipment is called the appareil Fernez-Le Prieur ('Fernez-Le Prieur apparatus'). On 6 August 1926 Fernez and Le Prieur put on a public demonstration of the device in the Tourelles' swimming pool (in French, Piscine des Tourelles) in Paris, and it is then approved by the French Navy. In 1933 le Prieur dropped all of the three Fernez patented features used on their co-invention (the goggles, the nose-clip and the one-way valve mouthpiece). He replaced them by a full face mask of his invention, directly air-supplied from the tank, so, as of 1933, all of le Prieur's subsequent patents used the mask and were called by the name of appareil Le Prieur ('Le Prieur apparatus').|$|E

40|$|The {{lymphatic system}} {{consists}} {{of a network of}} vessels which work to return the interstitial fluid back to the blood circulation. Individual units called lymphangions, segments of lymphatic vessels between two valves, pump cyclically to propel lymph. Lymphangions are similar to the heart in that they are sensitive to both preload and afterload. To describe the heart independent of preload and afterload, investigators developed the concept of time-varying elastance. We evaluated the applicability of this concept to lymphangions by analyzing preliminary data obtained from the bovine mesenteric vessels. We found that there were some limitations to the applicability of this concept to lymphangions, as there was a high degree of variability with respect to contraction strength and frequency of individual time-varying elastance curves. To better characterize lymphangion mechanics, we built a device which would enable real-time isobaric, isometric and isotonic experiments in vitro. We performed all three experiments on lymphatic vessel segments and obtained input and <b>output</b> <b>pressures,</b> <b>output</b> flow, instantaneous radii and wall tension. The characterization of the lymphangion using these parameters can be the first step to simulate the behavior of a lymphatic vesssel and later the behavior of an entire lymphatic system...|$|R
