An aging eccentric, Firs {{considers}} the emancipation of the Russian serfs a disaster, and talks nostalgically of the <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> everybody admired their masters and owners, such as Gayev's parents and grandparents.

25|$|The {{tourists}} flew to Sydney, where Mike Denness {{held a press}} conference, then flew on to Adelaide for net {{practice and}} their first matches. Here they also saw Dennis Lillee in his first match since his breakdown in 1973, taking 4/82 and 3/40 for Western Australia against South Australia. Frank Tyson noted that the tour was far more hectic than the <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> the team arrived by boat. Instead of having seven first class matches and a similar number of country matches before the First Test they now only had four first class matches, and few of the England players had time to accustom themselves to local conditions. Most of the party only had two games under their belt when they played Australia at the Gabba. Also the country games were no longer two-day occasions for relaxation, but were crammed into a 10-hour, one-day flying visit, which allowed little time to be feted by the locals or for the players to rest.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{showed the}} unwillingness of Sisko to accept his {{position}} as a religious figure within the Bajoran culture. [...] This theme was first explored in [...] "Emissary", the pilot of the series. The ongoing theme for Bajoran politics and religion began with [...] "In the Hands of the Prophets" [...] and ran {{through the rest of}} the series. Wolfe was raised as a Catholic, and he attributes the religious theme of the episode to this influence, as well as his interest in history. [...] He compares the religious intrigue of the story to the history of Catholicism in the 15th and 16th century, a time when members of various families jostled for power to become Pope. When asked to describe the character of Winn, Louise Fletcher said, [...] "Think the Pope in space, except she's like an ancient Pope, from the <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Popes were ruthless and powerful and exerted their powers and fought wars and did all kinds of naughty things." ...|$|E

Remington of the Rochester Evening Journal later wrote, [...] "Local fans used to pan Arthur Irwin in the <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Arthur was as innocent of wrong {{as the little}} sparrows on the limbs. Arthur's job was to win ball games minus talent. He couldn't do it." [...] While managing the Eastern League's Hartford Senators in 1921 against a New York semi-pro team, Irwin noticed the play of Lou Gehrig and convinced him to sign his first professional contract with Hartford. Gehrig had already committed to play at Columbia University and professional experience would affect his collegiate eligibility, so he began playing for Hartford using assumed names like Lou Lewis. However, Columbia found out about Gehrig's play and the slugger was forced to sit out of college baseball for a year.|$|E

He has performed on over 1,500 records spanning 36years. Music journalist Jude Gold noted, [...] "It's hard to name a guitarist who has had a more prolific and fulfilling career than Steve Lukather." [...] Lukather credits fellow Toto members David Paich and Jeff Porcaro for getting him exposure in the industry—although he lamented in an April 2011 interview that opportunities for session musicians have curtailed in recent years: [...] "There is no 'session guy' thing any more—not like it was. It's not like the <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> I was doing 25 sessions a week. All the studios are gone. The budgets are gone. The record companies are all gone."

500|$|In Shuffle! Essence+, {{there are}} four new storylines {{available}} in the game. Tsubomi is Kareha's younger sister, and like Kareha, she {{has a tendency to}} space out when she see something romantic or cute. Her catchphrase is [...] "Kya! Kya! Kya!". She's the same age as Primula, so they easily become friends. Sakura is Rin's and Kaede's childhood friend, they know each other since elementary school. That's why she knows about Rin's and Kaede's tragic past. Nadeshiko is Rin's homeroom teacher. She's quite self-confident, firmly stepping on the ground, single, attractive and is frequently the victim of pickup lines, including from the Lord of Devils and Itsuki. It appears she has some martial arts training (being able to slice a bottle with her bare hand). She has a habit of dealing out very strong punishments such as writing 100-page reports and dragging a tire around the track for minor offenses. However when it comes speak about romantic relationship or cuteness she can become shy, specially when someone speaks so about her. Daisy is Sia's cousin. When they were kids they used to play a lot together, but because of some circumstances between their fathers both of them stopped playing together. Daisy remember the precious for her time she spend with Lisianthus, but Sia seems to forgotten the <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> <b>when</b> they were together.|$|E

Sorensen argues that these images of historical landmarks [...] "were intended to inspire awe and respect for the treasures of ancient Japan in contrast to the impurity of the present." [...] Sorensen also claims that, to Ozu’s audience, [...] "the exaltation of Japanese tradition and cultural and religious heritage must have brought remembrances of the good <b>old</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Japan was still winning her battles abroad and nationalism reached its peak." [...] To scholars such as Bordwell who assert that Ozu was promoting with this film an ideology that could be called liberal, Sorensen argues that contemporary reviews of the film [...] "show that Ozu (the director and his personal convictions) was considered inseparable from his films, and that he was considered a conservative purist." ...|$|E
