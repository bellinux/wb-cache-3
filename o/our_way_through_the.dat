500|$|In 2008 The Independent {{noted that}} [...] "Tolle's {{theories}} are certainly {{seen by many}} as profoundly non-Christian, even though Tolle often quotes from the Bible," [...] but that [...] "Tolle does have fans in academic, even Christian, circles". It cited Andrew Ryder, a theologian at All Hallows College in Dublin, who wrote, [...] "While he may not use the language of traditional Christian spirituality, Tolle is very much concerned that, as we make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ordinary events of the day, we keep in touch with the deepest source of our being." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Plain Language from Truthful James" [...] (or [...] "The Heathen Chinee") {{was very}} popular among general readers. One New York {{newspaper}} {{reported on the}} frenzy over the poem: [...] "Strolling down Broadway... we saw a crowd of men and boys, {{of high and low}} degree, swarming about a shop-window, pushing, laughing, and struggling... Elbowing <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> crowd, we discovered an illustrated copy of Bret Harte's poem 'The Heathen Chinee.'" ...|$|E
60|$|It was now early morning, {{and we had}} no {{difficulty}} in making <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> woods to the main road.|$|E
60|$|She {{commenced}} {{calling in}} a low singsong voice that was half purr. She continued this as we wound <b>our</b> tedious <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> maze of subterranean passages and chambers.|$|R
6000|$|... "If so, why {{stand here}} to be spitted, fool? Come, let us cut <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> ere <b>the</b> shafts begin to fly, and take refuge among the trees or in the Nunnery." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{stood between}} us. I was aware {{from the first}} of {{something}} unfamiliar in her manner, something of which a glimmering had appeared on <b>our</b> <b>way</b> home <b>through</b> <b>the</b> wood.|$|R
60|$|There was no {{difficulty}} about picking <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> morass, for wherever the five could go we three could follow.|$|E
60|$|When we {{had forced}} <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{underbrush}} for {{a distance of}} perhaps another mile, we were halted by a swamp.|$|E
60|$|Saturday, August 13. Berlin to Wittenberg, two hours' ride. Examined the Schloss-Kirche, where Luther is buried, {{passing on}} <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> public square {{containing}} his monument.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{must make}} haste and rejoin Peterkin," [...] said Jack; [...] "it's getting late." [...] And without further remark, we {{threaded}} <b>our</b> <b>way</b> quickly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> woods towards the shore.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, never doubt her again!" [...] pleaded Norah. [...] "We {{are alone}} now--we have <b>our</b> hard <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> world {{to walk on}} as patiently as we can. If Magdalen ever falters and turns back, help her {{for the love of}} old times; help her against herself." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were flying}} at a snail's pace {{but a few}} feet above the ground--literally feeling <b>our</b> <b>way</b> along <b>through</b> <b>the</b> darkness, for both moons had set, and the night was black with the clouds {{that are to be}} found only at Mars's two extremities.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is pleasant," [...] said he; [...] "but I {{might try}} to force <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hedge. The briers would {{probably}} prick me severely, {{and that would be}} delightful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something {{more than}} that will be necessary, because the ground is frozen. Look around for an axe; we shall be obliged to work <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> frost," [...] Amos cried.|$|E
6000|$|When we elbowed <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> noisy room {{toward the}} bar Chisholm proffered the usual refreshment, {{and with a}} {{comprehensive}} {{wave of his hand}} bade the tender, [...] "Set them up!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We mounted our {{horses and}} rode off. In the darkness, we came {{suddenly}} upon {{a body of}} Tippoo's horsemen, but dashed straight at them and cut <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through,</b> but with <b>the</b> loss of half our force, and did not draw rein until we reached Madras.|$|R
60|$|The gale had {{increased}} rather than moderated, {{and the wind}} screamed all round us with an infernal clamour. So great was its force {{that we had to}} put our shoulders against it, and bore <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> it, while <b>the</b> sand and gravel tingled up against our faces.|$|R
6000|$|... "Four hundred infantry, {{making the}} attempt at night under good guidance, might manage {{to slip into}} the place, but this {{procession}} of ours is, to my mind, tempting destruction, for we certainly cannot hope to cut <b>our</b> <b>way,</b> by force, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> whole Russian army.|$|R
60|$|My {{favourite}} amusement, as we thus threaded <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ice, was {{to ascend}} to the royal-yard, {{and there to}} sit and cogitate whilst gazing on the most beautiful and romantic scenes.|$|E
60|$|We made few halts, {{and then}} {{only for a few}} moments at a time. We ate as we walked, forcing <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> dense underbrush, and ever on the alert against danger.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is best we see Captain Baker {{as soon as}} may be, and if {{you think}} we can find <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> woods, I'll say nothing against a short cut, for time presses." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Our</b> <b>way</b> now led <b>through</b> <b>the</b> bed of {{a shallow}} water-course; Mohi observing, as we went, that our feet were being washed at every step; whereas, to tread the dusty earth {{would be to}} desecrate the holy Morai, by {{transferring}} thereto, the base soil of less sacred ground.|$|R
40|$|Economists, in {{the context}} of economics, do not {{distinguish}} between conscious and unconscious thought- I have heard some discuss the distinction {{in the context}} of their psychotherapy sessions. 1 But, psychologists find the distinction central to explaining choices, perceptions, and how we manage to make <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> world. 2 The unconscious, once limited to harboring our infantile Freudian traumas, now plays many roles. Much recent research in psychology and neurobiology suggests that our brain consists of many separate processing centers: one for conscious thought (“should I or shouldn’t I buy the Lexus and marry Shirley”) and many for unconscious tasks. Unconscious activities were once thought limited to such mundane activities as processing language, not falling over, and seeing what we see when we open our eyes – the stuff the conscious mind did not need to be bothered with. Now it is thought that our unconscious also plays a major role in many of the choices we make – my perception that a Lexus is better than a Ford, and my decision to drop Lois and get the new Lexus. 3 And, these different centers don’t always agree on the course of action. We are “not of one mind. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{we shall}} have nightfall to cover us when we draw off, {{so that we may}} make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> back <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mountains. I would station a score of archers here in the pass, with all our pennons jutting forth from the rocks, and as many nakirs and drums and bugles as we have with us, so that those who follow us in the fading light may think that the whole army of the prince is upon them, and fear to go further. What think you of my plan, Sir Simon?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is where}} the {{difficulty}} will begin. In the first place {{there will be the}} trouble of crossing, and then that of making <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> country. Certainly we could not do so as Vendean peasants." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{were a good}} step," [...] Sir John said; [...] "but {{even when}} we gain the ledge I know not how we shall force <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hole, which you say is but three feet high." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must stay}} here several days," [...] {{he said in}} conclusion. [...] "After a time the men will grow careless, and then {{we may be able}} to make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> lines; but now it is impossible." ...|$|E
60|$|We picked <b>our</b> <b>way</b> deviously <b>through</b> <b>the</b> busy groups. Apparently {{it was not}} {{etiquette}} {{to notice}} a Guard officer, and the youths at the twenty-five pounder were far too busy to look up. I watched the cleanly finished hoist and shove-home of the full-weight shell from a safe distance, when I became aware of a change among the scattered boys on the common, who disappeared among the hillocks to an accompaniment of querulous whistles. A boy or two on bicycles dashed from corps to corps, and on their arrival each corps seemed to fade away.|$|R
5000|$|We {{did have}} one parade that I do remember, with humour. There {{was a big}} {{football}} game at Varsity Stadium. The L.G.M.B. marched up and, to the amazement of the ticket collectors, we played <b>our</b> <b>way</b> right <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gate {{and on to the}} field. For this event we were all wearing great big moustaches. When we came to the fifty yard line I noticed Sidney Smith sitting in front. I offered him a moustache, which he put on. The band serenaded him. Ergo, Sidney Smith, President of The University of Toronto, became an Honorary Member of the L.G.M.B.

6000|$|... "We {{should run}} the risk of losing a good many men in doing so, and a good many more as we made <b>our</b> <b>way</b> up <b>through</b> <b>the</b> trees and drove them out, and should gain nothing by it, for as soon as we retired they would reoccupy the position. No; if they get very {{troublesome}} I will slue a couple of guns round and occasionally send a round or two of grape among the trees. That will be better than your doing so, because your men at the guns would make an easy mark for them, while we are farther off, and indeed almost out of range of their muskets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What am I to do, Chloe?" [...] {{the girl}} asked in perplexity. [...] "I am sure we cannot stay here. We must find <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> woods to Nashville, and I must {{try and get}} {{something}} to do there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you so much}} as fancy {{we might}} get into the town? Or, having smuggled <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> lines, that we could remain there an hour without being detected?" [...] I cried, amazed because my comrade had {{seemingly}} suggested such a perilous adventure.|$|E
6000|$|... "I and my servant cut <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> assailants, {{who were}} led by the Vicomte de Tulle, who had before carried off Mademoiselle de Pointdexter. I {{was on my way}} south to la Vallee, with but faint hope of meeting you on the road." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will do," [...] Ronald said; [...] "they are {{beginning}} to slip off. Now we will charge straight down upon them; I and my troopers will cut <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> and enter <b>the</b> house. There is fighting {{going on in there}} still. Do you, gentlemen, take our horses as we dismount, and ride off, and then open fire again on the rascals from a distance. We shall be able to hold the house if we can once enter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was {{a miserable}} {{kind of an}} ajoupa near the river-side; and we had some {{difficulty}} in making <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to it <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tangled dank grass and brushwood which surrounded it. Nor was the journey rendered more pleasant by the constant rustling among this undergrowth, that reminded us that there were such things as snakes and other ugly creatures to be met with on our road.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall never}} be able to get down to Rangoon by water," [...] said Meinik. [...] "The river will be crowded with rowboats near the town; {{and there will be no}} chance, whatever, of making <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> them. At <b>the</b> next village we come to, I will go in and learn the news. Your countrymen may have been driven out by this time and, in that case, there will be nothing to do but to travel north on foot, until we reach Chittagong." ...|$|R
