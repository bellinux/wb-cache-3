That year, Neddermeyer and Anderson discovered the muon, using cloud chamber measurements <b>of</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays. Their discovery predated Hideki Yukawa's 1935 theory of mesons that postulated the particle as mediating the nuclear force. Anderson and Neddermeyer collaborated with Millikan in high altitude studies <b>of</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays, which confirmed Robert Oppenheimer's theory that the air showers produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays contained electrons. They also obtained the first evidence that gamma rays can generate positrons.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{political}} stances, Morrison's attention began drifting towards the stars. In 1954, he published a paper with Bruno Rossi and Stanislaw Olbert {{in which they}} explored Enrico Fermi's theory of how cosmic rays travel through the galaxy. Morrison followed this up with a review of theories of the origins <b>of</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays in 1957. A 1958 paper in Nuovo Cimento is considered to mark the birth of gamma ray astronomy.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the characteristics <b>of</b> the solar <b>cosmic</b> ray flux.

The cosmic ray detec-tor systems described here were flown aboard the Pioneers 8 and 9 spacecrafts which were launched into heliocentric orbit. The cosmic ray detector systems were designed to provide de-tailed measurements of a) the temporal variations <b>of</b> the omni-directional <b>cosmic</b> ray flux, b) the energy spectrum <b>of</b> the <b>cosmic</b> ray particles, and c) the directional properties (i^e., anisotropy) <b>of</b> the <b>cosmic</b> ray flux.

40|$|Discussion <b>of</b> solar <b>cosmic</b> ray {{phenomena}} and related topics from the solar physical point of view. Since {{solar cosmic rays}} are usually produced by solar flares, {{it is necessary to}} understand the processes and mechanism of solar flares, especially the so-called proton flares, {{in order to understand the}} acceleration mechanism <b>of</b> solar <b>cosmic</b> rays and their behavior in both the solar atmosphere and interplanetary space. For this reason, a detailed discussion is given of various phenomena associated with solar flares, proton flare characteristics, and the mechanism of solar flares. Since the discovery <b>of</b> solar <b>cosmic</b> rays by Forbush, the interplanetary space has been thought of as a medium in which solar cosmic rays propagate. The propagation <b>of</b> solar <b>cosmic</b> rays in this space is therefore discussed briefly by referring to the observed magnetic properties of this space. Finally, some problems related to the physics <b>of</b> galactic <b>cosmic</b> rays are discussed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} the {{observation}} of new properties <b>of</b> secondary <b>cosmic</b> rays Li, Be, and B measured in the rigidity (momentum per unit charge) range 1. 9  GV to 3. 3  TV {{with a total of}} 5. 4 × 106 nuclei collected by AMS during {{the first five years of}} operation aboard the International Space Station. The Li and B fluxes have an identical rigidity dependence above 7  GV and all three fluxes have an identical rigidity dependence above 30  GV with the Li/Be flux ratio of 2. 0 ± 0. 1. The three fluxes deviate from a single power law above 200  GV in an identical way. This behavior <b>of</b> secondary <b>cosmic</b> rays has also been observed in the AMS measurement <b>of</b> primary <b>cosmic</b> rays He, C, and O but the rigidity dependences <b>of</b> primary <b>cosmic</b> rays and <b>of</b> secondary <b>cosmic</b> rays are distinctly different.

5|$|Other {{attempts}} to modify general relativity {{have been made}} in the context of cosmology. In the modern cosmological models, most energy in the universe is in forms that have never been detected directly, namely dark energy and dark matter. There have been several controversial proposals to remove the need for these enigmatic forms of matter and energy, by modifying the laws governing gravity and the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>cosmic</b> expansion, for example modified Newtonian dynamics.|$|E
5|$|Phenomena modeled by {{theoretical}} astronomers include: stellar {{dynamics and}} evolution; galaxy formation; large-scale distribution of {{matter in the}} Universe; origin <b>of</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics.

The first, the zodiacal dust cloud, lies in the inner Solar System and causes the zodiacal light.

5|$|In 1932, as a {{graduate}} student at Chicago, he discovered physics there and had the rare opportunity to use the equipment of legendary physicist Albert A. Michelson. Alvarez also constructed an apparatus of Geiger counter tubes arranged as a cosmic ray telescope, and under the aegis of his faculty advisor Arthur Compton, conducted an experiment in Mexico City to measure the so-called East–West effect <b>of</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays. Observing more incoming radiation from the west, Alvarez concluded that primary cosmic rays were positively charged. Compton submitted the resulting paper to the Physical Review, with Alvarez's name at the top.|$|E
5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction <b>of</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E

5|$|In the prologue, John {{identifies}} Jesus as the Logos (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, {{the term}} logos meant the principle <b>of</b> <b>cosmic</b> reason. In this sense, it {{was similar to}} the Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of the Logos, applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of the Logos.|$|E

With his students he also made important contributions to the modern theory of neutron stars and black holes, {{as well as to}} quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and the interactions <b>of</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays. As a teacher and promoter of science, he is remembered as a founding father of the American school of theoretical physics that gained world prominence in the 1930s.

5|$|Without the {{protection}} of the Earth's atmosphere, cosmonauts were exposed to higher levels of radiation from a steady flux <b>of</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays and trapped protons from the South Atlantic Anomaly. The station's crews were exposed to an absorbed dose of about 5.2cGy {{over the course of a}} 115-day expedition, producing an equivalent dose of 14.75cSv, or 1133µSv per day. This daily dose is approximately that received from natural background radiation on Earth in two years. The radiation environment of the station was not uniform; closer proximity to the station's hull led to an increased radiation dose, and the strength of radiation shielding varied between modules; Kvant-2's being better than the core module, for instance.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put to good use. Still others noted the film used another common theme <b>of</b> <b>cosmic</b> collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet {{on a collision course with}} the Earth.|$|E
