5|$|In Glenfinnan, the Hogwarts Express crosses a viaduct, {{as it has}} in {{the past}} films. Aerial scenes were shot in Glen Coe, in Clachaig Gully, and Glen Etive, which, at the time of filming, was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in Scotland without snow, making it ideal for a backdrop.|$|E
5|$|The Senate was the {{predominant}} political {{institution in the}} Roman Republic. The Senate's authority derived primarily from custom and tradition. It was also one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in which free political discussion could take place. The Senate's principal role was as an advisory council to the consuls on matters of foreign and military policy, and it exercised {{a great deal of}} influence over consular decision-making.|$|E
5|$|Before the Mexican–American War, {{when this}} area was ceded to the United States, the main trade route through this part of Mexico was the Old Spanish Trail. This trail {{extended}} from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Los Angeles. The trail had multiple routes; however, the main route proceeded north towards Moab, Utah, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> where the Colorado River can be crossed without having to traverse steep cliffs. The modern US491 roughly correlates with the main route of the Old Spanish Trail between Cortez, Colorado and its northern terminus.|$|E
50|$|Many species <b>of</b> birds inhabit <b>the</b> {{lake area}} {{including}} the endemic San Cristóbal mockingbird and white-cheeked pintail. Due to {{its status as}} an isolated source of fresh water, {{it is also one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>place</b> to witness frigatebirds preening their feathers.|$|R
50|$|The Delta Watershed park is {{a popular}} {{destination}} for local riders. It is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>place</b> to mountain bike in Delta. There are other locations but they are mainly paved trails with no features - for instance Burns Bog trails (by Great Pacific Forum) and the Boundary Bay Dike.|$|R
5000|$|Moira's toponym {{is derived}} from <b>the</b> Irish earldom <b>of</b> Moira, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> titles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hastings family, which held Ashby de la Zouch Castle. The former local colliery, Rawdon Colliery, also bore a Hastings family name. Moira is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>place</b> names in England to end in an [...] "a".|$|R
5|$|Didsbury was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> between Stretford and Stockport {{where the}} River Mersey could be forded, {{which made it}} {{significant}} for troop movements during the English Civil War, in which Manchester was on the Parliamentarian side. The Royalist commander, Prince Rupert, stationed himself at Didsbury Ees, {{to the south of}} Barlow Moor. It is also likely that Bonnie Prince Charlie crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in 1745, in the Jacobite march south from Manchester to Derby, and again in his subsequent retreat.|$|E
5|$|The {{corncrake}} {{can be seen}} at {{the bridge}} of Banagher in the summer. Once a common summer visitor to Ireland, corncrakes have suffered drastic population declines over the last few decades and are threatened with global extinction. Conservation efforts have focused on changing harvesting times to avoid the nesting season, May to August. The hay meadows of the callows support large numbers of these birds – one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in the world where this globally threatened species is still common.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} super Barcelona {{has often been}} political. Though it is a club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona {{gradually}} became a club associated with Catalan values. In Spain's transition to autocracy in 1925, Catalonia became increasingly hostile towards the central government in Madrid. The hostility enhanced Barcelona's image as {{a focal point for}} Catalonism, and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language, the stadium of Barcelona became one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> the people could express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish transition to democracy in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of Catalan pride. In the 2000s – a period of sporting success in the club and an increased focus on Catalan players – club officials have openly called for Catalonia to become an independent state.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 600 {{grizzly bears}} {{live in the}} Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{with more than half}} of the population living within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to take it off the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting the grizzly are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. Black bears are common in the park and were a park symbol due to visitor interaction with the bears starting in 1910. Feeding and close contact with bears has not been permitted since the 1960s to reduce their desire for human foods. Yellowstone is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in the United States where black bears can be seen coexisting with grizzly bears. Black bear observations occur most often in the park's northern ranges and in the Bechler area which is in the park's southwestern corner.|$|E

25|$|The Greek {{island of}} Syros, whose {{population}} is divided almost equally between Catholics and Orthodox, is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> {{where the two}} Churches share a common date for Easter, with the Catholics accepting the Orthodox date—a practice helping considerably in maintaining good {{relations between the two}} communities.|$|E
25|$|The Otago Peninsula is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in New Zealand {{where there}} is {{everywhere}} visible evidence of the long human occupation of the land. In a magnificent but compact setting {{the challenge is to}} maintain its balance of human and natural in the face of growing residential and tourist development.|$|E
25|$|The main {{function}} of the Gileppe Dam {{in the 21st century}} is to provide drinking water. As these needs are met, surplus water is turbinated. In 1997, the Gileppe Dam produced 3,255,525 cubic metres of drinking water. Although capacity is small, the Vesdre basin is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in Belgium to produce hydropower.|$|E

25|$|This is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in North America {{where an}} astrobleme has been identified. While some {{scholars}} speculate that prehistoric Native Americans may have placed the mound {{in relation to}} this geological anomaly, {{at the time of}} construction of the mound there was nothing visible at ground level that would have captured their attention.|$|E
25|$|Scheduled coaches, {{marketed as}} part of the National Express network, link Eltham Green to Pimlico and Victoria in central London and to several {{destinations}} on the Kent coast via Bluewater (a retail-based development on a grand scale in Dartford borough) and Canterbury. Eltham Green is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in south London served by National Express coaches.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle was}} largely {{determined}} by the Spanish dragoons commanded by the Marquis of Valdecañas and the Count of Aguilar, which far exceeded the opposing forces. The Austrian forces retreated, pursued by Spanish cavalry, and the allied army was reduced to 6,000 or 7,000 men when it reached Barcelona (one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in Spain still recognizing Charles' authority) on 6 January.|$|E

25|$|The City of Eureka is {{the largest}} of the local water districts {{supplied}} by the Humboldt Bay Municipal Water District. The entire region is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in California that has historically enjoyed a significant surplus of water. The reduction in major forest products manufacturing in recent decades has left the area with a 45 MGD surplus of industrial water.|$|E
25|$|The 2015 Lancaster City Council {{election}} result saw the Council remain in no overall control, but with Labour {{as the largest}} party again, governing as a minority administration without a formal coalition. Labour gained 29 seats, Conservatives 19, the Greens 9, Morecambe Bay Independents 2, and 1 Free Independent. Lancaster is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> {{in the country where}} the Greens have consistently had a number of councillors since 1999.|$|E
25|$|Glass work {{is mostly}} done though blowing {{techniques}} to make decorative objects, bells, flowers and more. Texcoco is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>places</b> in Mexico {{where this is}} produced using traditional techniques and division of labor. One famous factory was founded by Antonio Derfingher in 1948. Born here and descended from glass blowers, the maestro has since died but the factory still survives making stem glasses, water glasses, ashtrays, fruit bowls, flower vases and more.|$|E
