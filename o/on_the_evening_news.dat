He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>news.</b> The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking how they felt about going to the same high school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E

500|$|Gittings {{found a home}} in the gay {{group that}} formed in 1970 in the American Library Association, the first gay caucus in a {{professional}} association, and became its coordinator in 1971. She pushed the American Library Association for more visibility for gays and lesbians in the profession. She staffed a kissing booth at the Dallas convention of the ALA, underneath the banner [...] "Hug a Homosexual," [...] with a [...] "women only" [...] side and a [...] "men only" [...] side. When no one took advantage of it, she and Patience and Sarah author Alma Routsong (pen name: Isabel Miller) kissed in front of rolling television cameras. In describing its success, despite most of the reaction being negative, Gittings said, [...] "We needed to get an audience. So we decided, let's show gay love live. We were offering free—mind you, free—same-sex kisses and hugs. Let me tell you, the aisles were mobbed, but no one came into the booth to get a free hug. So we hugged and kissed each other.

500|$|O'Mahoney and Winter {{began working}} on the film in 2006.

They wanted to make a {{documentary}} about [...] "the people never seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>news,</b> [...] presidents, prime ministers, generals and militants ... claiming to know something of Iraq's future". Winter explained that [...] "all these documentaries coming out of Iraq were done for or by adults. Iraqi children had not been more than a UN statistic about the dead, kidnapped or injured", so they decided to concentrate on what they viewed as the [...] "real source of Iraq's future" [...] – teenagers. [...] "I wanted {{to tell the story of}} Iraq in a different way. As journalists, we do stories about kids and teenagers, but we don't hear from them. If you go to the UN reports, they are just a number and that's it." [...] O'Mahoney was a little more reticent; he had recently worked in Iraq but did not wish to return due to the civil war and the deteriorating condition of the country. When it was decided to use a school as a backdrop to the story, which could also be used to provide a chronological narrative, O'Mahoney and Winter realised it would be too dangerous for the students to be seen with either a Western or Iraqi camera crew because it would draw too much attention to them, and so they decided that the students would film the documentary themselves.|$|E

500|$|The {{battle over}} the Pryor Mountain herd moved to the {{national}} level on July 11, 1968, when ABC broadcast a special on the horses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>news.</b> The public reacted with outrage, and the BLM responded that [...] "no decision had yet been made regarding the horses." [...] However, {{by the end of}} August, a trap to collect the horses had been completed. At the same time, the BLM was unresponsive to efforts by members of the public, senators and officials from the Humane Society of the United States to ascertain final plans regarding the horses. Because of this, court proceedings were begun, and on August 27, 1968, a US District Court judge made a decision that had the result of barring the BLM from removing the horses from the range. On September 9, 1968, the Secretary of the Interior, Stewart L. Udall, declared the area inhabited by the Pryor Mountain Mustangs as the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Refuge (PMWHR), in a decision later noted in the Congressional Record. After the creation of the refuge the BLM appointed a committee to study the area and make recommendations regarding appropriate herd numbers. The committee, which met in late 1968 and early 1969, was made up of range and wildlife experts, local citizens interested in the herds and representatives from several federal, state and private organizations. A boundary adjustment was made to the refuge, adding some land in Wyoming. The final report of the committee, submitted in June 1969, was that the horses were not in danger of starvation, that overgrazing was likely due to domestic sheep who utilized the land decades earlier, and that horses were the most likely of any species to be able to survive and thrive in the Pryor Mountain environment. On December 18, 1971, the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 (WFRHBA) was signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon. The Act made it a crime for anyone to harass or kill feral horses or burros on federal land, required the departments of the Interior and Agriculture to protect the animals, required studies of the animals' habits and habitats, and permitted public land to be set aside for their use. [...] The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service were jointly charged with responsibility for administrating the Act. The National Park Service was also involved in the management of the land. These federal agencies were limited to managing horses only on public lands where [...] "wild horses were documented as being 'presently found' {{at the time of the}} passage of the Act in 1971." ...|$|E
