25|$|Bitumen was the nemesis of {{many artists}} during the 19th century. Although widely {{used for a}} time, it {{ultimately}} proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common diluents, such as linseed <b>oil,</b> <b>varnish</b> and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of Delacroix. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (1818–1819), where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.|$|E
500|$|It {{was later}} painted {{by a local}} man, Carlos Basabe Cerdá. The job proved to be very {{difficult}} due to strong winds that blew the wooden planks off the scaffolding and into a nearby ditch. A construction team later tied on the planks, solving the problem. The painters first applied [...] a primer coat, then linseed <b>oil,</b> <b>varnish,</b> and finally a coat of copper glitter. The monument was inaugurated during the opening of the Comahue National Fair on September 7, 1964.|$|E
40|$|Two violins were investigated. The only {{intentionally}} introduced {{difference between}} them {{was the type of}} varnish. One of the instruments was covered with a spirit varnish, the other was <b>oil</b> <b>varnished.</b> Experimental modal analysis was done for unvarnished/varnished violins and a questionnaire inquiry on the instrument’s sound quality was performed. The aim of both examinations was to find differences and similarities between the two instruments in the objective (modal parameters) and subjective domain (subjective evaluation of sound quality). In the modal analysis, three strongly radiating signature modes were taken into account. Varnishing did not change the sequence of mode shapes. Modal frequencies A 0 and B(1 +) were not changed by <b>oil</b> <b>varnishing</b> compared to the unvarnished condition. For the <b>oil</b> <b>varnished</b> instrument, the frequency of mode B(1 +) was lower than that of the same mode of the spirit varnished instrument. Our two violins were not excellent instruments, but before varnishing they were practically identical. However, after varnishing it appeared that the oil-varnished violin was better than the spirit-varnished instrument. Therefore, it can be assumed with a fairly high probability that also in general, the oil-varnished violins sound somewhat better than initially identical spirit-varnished ones...|$|R

2500|$|According to Vasari, {{his father}} {{placed him in}} the {{workshop}} of the Umbrian master Pietro Perugino as an apprentice [...] "despite the tears of his mother". The evidence of an apprenticeship comes only from Vasari and another source, and has been disputed—eight was very early for an apprenticeship to begin. An alternative theory is that he received at least some training from Timoteo Viti, who acted as court painter in Urbino from 1495. Most modern historians agree that Raphael at least worked {{as an assistant to}} Perugino from around 1500; the influence of Perugino on Raphael's early work is very clear: [...] "probably no other pupil of genius has ever absorbed so much of his master's teaching as Raphael did", according to Wölfflin. Vasari wrote {{that it was impossible to}} distinguish between their hands at this period, but many modern art historians claim to do better and detect his hand in specific areas of works by Perugino or his workshop. Apart from stylistic closeness, their techniques are very similar as well, for example having paint applied thickly, using an <b>oil</b> <b>varnish</b> medium, in shadows and darker garments, but very thinly on flesh areas. An excess of resin in the varnish often causes cracking of areas of paint in the works of both masters. The Perugino workshop was active in both Perugia and Florence, perhaps maintaining two permanent branches. Raphael is described as a [...] "master", that is to say fully trained, in December 1500.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{observation}} {{respecting the}} cause, {{or one of}} the causes, of a wrinkled and shriveled surface, is not unimportant. Oil, or an <b>oil</b> <b>varnish,</b> used in abundance with the colors over a perfectly dry preparation, will produce this appearance: the employment of an <b>oil</b> <b>varnish</b> is even supposed to be detected by it.... As regards the effect itself, the best painters have not been careful to avoid it. Parts of Titian's St. Sebastian (now in the Gallery of the Vatican) are shriveled; the Giorgione in the Louvre is so; the drapery of the figure of Christ in the Duke of Wellington's Correggio exhibits the same appearance; a Madonna and Child by Reynolds, at Petworth, is in a similar state, as are also parts of some pictures by Greuze. It is the reverse of a cracked surface, and is unquestionably the less evil of the two."--"Eastlake," [...] pp. 36-38.|$|E
50|$|A linseed <b>oil</b> and <b>varnish</b> factory, Zabret & Comp., was {{established}} in Britof in 1905. Before the Second World War it had its own electrical generator and processed 300 train cars of linseed per year, mostly imported from Argentina and India. The <b>oil</b> and <b>varnish</b> were sold in Yugoslavia, and the linseed pomace was exported to Austria and Germany. The factory had 30 workers in the 1930s; it developed further after the war, and employed 100 workers by the 1960s.|$|R

5|$|Since the {{kauri gum}} {{was found to}} mix more easily with linseed oil, at lower temperatures, than other resins, by the 1890s, 70 percent of all <b>oil</b> <b>varnishes</b> made in England used kauri gum. It was used to a limited extent in paints during the late 19th century, and from 1910 was used {{extensively}} {{in the manufacture of}} linoleum. From the 1930s, the market for gum dropped as synthetic alternatives were found, but there remained niche uses for the gum in jewellery and specialist high-grade varnish for violins.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{therefore}} clear," [...] says Mr. Eastlake, [...] "that an <b>oil</b> <b>varnish,</b> composed either of inspissated nut oil, or of nut oil {{combined with a}} dissolved resin, was employed on gilt surfaces and pictures, {{with a view to}} preserve them, at least as early as the fifth century. It may be added that a writer who could then state, as if from his own experience, that such varnishes had the effect of preserving works 'for a long time,' can hardly be understood to speak of a new invention."--P. 22.|$|E

50|$|Violin {{varnishing}} is a multi-step process involving {{some or all}} of the following: primer, sealer, ground, color coats, {{and clear}} topcoat. Some systems use a drying <b>oil</b> <b>varnish</b> as described below, while others use spirit (or solvent) varnish. Touchup in repair or restoration is only done with spirit varnish.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{mixtures}} sold as finishing oils.

50|$|Kamptulicon was {{manufactured}} by sprinkling powdered cork on to thin bands of rubber, {{which was then}} rolled and rerolled until thoroughly mixed. It was then coated on one or both sides with linseed <b>oil</b> <b>varnish</b> or oil paint. Powdered sulphur was also sometimes mixed in, and the material then heated to produce a form of vulcanized kamptulicon.|$|E
5000|$|Non-"drying" [...] waxes, such as hard-film carnauba or paste wax, and resins, such as dammar, copal, and shellac, {{consist of}} long, spaghetti-like strands of {{hydrocarbon}} molecules, which interlace and compact {{but do not}} form covalent bonds {{in the manner of}} drying oils.

50|$|Pontypool {{japan is}} a name given {{to the process of}} japanning with the use of an <b>oil</b> <b>varnish</b> and heat which is {{credited}} to Thomas Allgood of Pontypool.

Another idea was spontaneous combustion. The lack of lifeboats and inability to launch them successfully at sea also caused public outrage, but little was done until after the loss of the Titanic in 1912.|$|E
50|$|Zhostovo {{painting}} is a handicraft of painting on metal trays, preliminary {{coated with a}} few layers of priming (putty) and <b>oil</b> <b>varnish</b> (usually, black).

The edges of a tray are painted with a light golden ornament called уборка (uborka). A finished tray is then covered with three layers of light lacquer and polished to brilliance.|$|E
