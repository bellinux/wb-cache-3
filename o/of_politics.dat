40|$|I advance an {{endogenous}} {{explanation for}} the systemic transformation <b>of</b> international <b>politics</b> and offer to neatly resolve the debate between offensive realism and defensive realism through a social evolutionary approach. I contend that international politics {{has always been an}} evolutionary system and it has evolved from an offensive realism world to a defensive realism world. Consequently, offensive realism and defensive realism are appropriate grand theories <b>of</b> international <b>politics</b> for two different historical epochs. Different grand theories <b>of</b> international <b>politics</b> are for different epochs <b>of</b> international <b>politics,</b> and different epochs <b>of</b> international <b>politics</b> actually need different theories <b>of</b> international <b>politics.</b> Because international politics has always been an evolutionary system, non-evolutionary approaches will be intrinsically incapable of shedding light on the evolution of the system.
