25|$|The {{transponder}} {{problem had}} been growing before the introduction of AIS. IFF worked {{on the basis of}} a small receiver/transmitter set that listened for pulses from a radar and produced a low-power pulse broadcast on the same frequency but slightly delayed. The signal returned to the radar-equipped aircraft along with the original radar signal. When the two were amplified and displayed, the IFF signal caused the blip seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> <b>screen</b> to stretch out. The original 1.5m radar system had by this time been adapted to a wide range of roles including AI, ASV and acting as the basis for both the CHL and the new AMES Type 7 ground control interception radars. To avoid interference problems, each of these operated on slightly different frequencies, from about 180 to 210MHz. The Navy and Army added their own variations. The IFF Mk. II, originally designed to respond to the Mk. IV, had to be repeatedly modified to respond to new radar frequencies, and none of the many models were able to respond to all of these.|$|E
