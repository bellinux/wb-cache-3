They {{are part of}} Singapore's Golden Jubilee (SG50) celebrations. 20 million pieces were printed for the $50 commemorative SG50 banknote, while 15 million pieces of each $10 commemorative SG50 design banknote were printed. There was an <b>oversupply</b> of these SG50 banknotes; by February 2016 only about {{less than half of}} them were actually issued.|$|E
5|$|Political and {{financial}} problems led to very low {{oil prices and}} <b>oversupply,</b> causing most metals to drop in price. The economies of China, India and other emerging countries slowed in 2014 and 2015. In 2014 alone, 23,722,890 motor vehicles were produced in China, excluding motorbikes. This resulted in a rhodium price of 740.00 US-$ per Troy ounce (31.1 grams) in late November 2015.|$|E

40|$|Background: Repeat {{prescribing}} used {{in long-term}} pharmacotherapy is {{often associated with}} inadequate patient medication, including non-adherence. In this paper we explore patients' drug refill adherence with repeat prescriptions and relate refill data to patient age and gender, type of prescriber, type of prescribed drug, and reimbursement level. Methods: During one week of 2002, copies of 3636 repeat prescriptions filled at 16 large Swedish pharmacies were collected. Satisfactory refill adherence was defined as dispensed refills covering 80 - 120 % of the prescribed treatment time. Under- and <b>oversupplying</b> were defined as 120 % coverage, respectively. Result: The average level of refill adherence was 57 %, and the level of under- and <b>oversupplying</b> 21 % and 22 %, respectively. There was no gender difference. Patients who were exempt from payment had higher <b>oversupplies</b> than others (33 % versus 19 %), and patients of general practitioners had higher refill adherence than patients of hospital physicians. The highest refill adherence was observed for contraceptives (81 %) and the lowest for anti-asthmatics, proton pump inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (30 - 40 %). Conclusions: Refill non-adherence includes both under- and <b>oversupplying</b> and may vary due to different attitudes between prescribers and between patients. Different therapeutic indications and reimbursement systems are other apparent causes. These observations should be considered in programs aiming to assist patients in following medication prescriptions...|$|R
5|$|Salford's built {{environment}} {{is made up}} of a range of building stock. Some inner-city areas are noted for chronic urban decay. Salford's housing stock is characterised by an <b>oversupply</b> of older, smaller terraced housing and flatted accommodation that declined in value during the late 20th century. As demand fell, it left many owners in negative equity and often without the means to maintain their homes in reasonable condition. As a result, much of the {{built environment}} is poor.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{attracted}} canon {{lawyers to}} his household, including Gerard la Pucelle, Peter of Blois, and Henry Pium of Northampton, {{all of whom}} advised him on legal matters. At the Council of Westminster that Richard convened in May 1175, nineteen canons were put forth, dealing with clerical marriage, the <b>oversupply</b> of ordained clergy, the behaviour of the clergy and their dress and tonsure, and simony. Another canon dealt with clandestine marriages and regulated child marriages. He was also heavily involved with trying judicial cases, both in the actual judgment {{as well as in}} the execution of judgments made by others. Four of his questions to Alexander III entered the Decretals and the other collections of canon law of the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of OPEC marked {{a turning point}} toward national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC decisions have come to play {{a prominent role in}} the global oil market and international relations. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and OPEC's revenue and wealth, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC started setting production targets for its member nations; and generally when the production targets are reduced, oil prices increase, most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim <b>oversupply.</b>|$|E

2500|$|By 2014–2015, {{the world}} oil market was again {{steadily}} <b>oversupplied,</b> {{led by an}} unexpected near-doubling in U.S. oil production from 2008 levels due to substantial improvements in shale [...] "fracking" [...] technology. By January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket fell to US$22.48/bbl – less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.

5|$|Worthington's eldest son, {{also named}} William (1764–1825), assumed {{control of the}} company {{following}} his father's death. On the death of Worthington in 1825 he was succeeded by his son, also named William (1799–1871). A combination of factors conspired to make the Baltic trade infeasible; the Napoleonic Wars disrupted trade in the region and the Russian government increased import tariffs in 1822. Combined with a decrease on malt duty in 1823, this led to an <b>oversupply</b> of beer in Burton. As a result, the brewers instead looked towards the expatriate community in India as an increasingly important export market. Worthington produced their own India Pale Ale from 1829 onwards.|$|E
5|$|In animals, {{when there}} is an <b>oversupply</b> of dietary {{carbohydrate}}, the excess carbohydrate is converted to triglycerides. This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of fatty acids in the production of triglycerides, a process called lipogenesis. Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.|$|E
5|$|The Kirk {{began to}} concern itself with {{providing}} {{churches in the}} new towns and relatively thinly supplied Highlands, establishing a church extension committee in 1828. Led by Thomas Chalmers, by the early 1840s it had added 222 churches, largely through public subscription. When the Great Disruption occurred in 1843, and roughly a third of ministers and their congregations left the established church and its buildings to form the Free Church of Scotland, Chalmers' organisational skills helped the Free Church build over 700 new places of worship by 1847. The established church took time to recover, but embarked on a rival programme of church building, increasing its number of parishes from 924 in 1843 to 1,437 by 1909. The intense competition between different denominations {{led to the creation}} of grand churches with tall steeples and ultimately resulted in an <b>oversupply</b> of churches, which would be a financial burden to future generations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the welfare implications of informative advertising in differentiated product oligopoly markets. The analysis reconciles the conflicting results {{in previous studies}} that find advertising to be undersupplied in homogeneous product markets, but <b>oversupplied</b> in differentiated product markets when the degree of differentiation is "small". In equilibrium, purely informative advertising is undersupplied when brands are sufficiently close substitutes and <b>oversupplied</b> when brands are more differentiated. Product differentiation also has welfare implications for the effect of technological change in the advertising sector. In response to an advertising cost innovation, equilibrium prices fall and the market converges to the socially optimal resource allocation for brands that are sufficiently close substitutes, whereas equilibrium prices rise and divergence occurs when brands are more differentiated. Oligopoly Product differentiation Informative advertising...|$|R

5|$|Unlike a {{significant}} number of registered breeds today, a horse cannot be registered as a Thoroughbred (with The Jockey Club registry) unless conceived by live cover, the witnessed natural mating of a mare and a stallion. Artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer (ET), though commonly used and allowable in many other horse breed registries, cannot be used with Thoroughbreds. One reason is that a greater possibility of error exists in assigning parentage with AI, and although DNA and blood testing eliminate many of those concerns, AI still requires more detailed record keeping. The main reason, however, may be economic; a stallion has a limited number of mares who can be serviced by live cover. Thus the practice prevents an <b>oversupply</b> of Thoroughbreds, although modern management still allows a stallion to live cover more mares in a season than was once thought possible. As an example, in 2008, the Australian stallion Encosta De Lago covered 227 mares. By allowing a stallion to cover only a couple of hundred mares a year rather than the couple of thousand possible with AI, it also preserves the high prices paid for horses of the finest or most popular lineages.|$|E

25|$|Substantial {{investments}} {{were made}} in the manufacture of solar panels and wind generators by a number of companies, supported by liberal loans by banks and local governments. However, by 2012 manufacturing capacity had far outstripped domestic and global demand for both products, particularly solar panels, which were subjected to anti-dumping penalties by both the United States and Europe. The global <b>oversupply</b> has resulted in bankruptcies and production cutbacks both inside and outside China. China has budgeted $50 billion to subsidize production of solar power over the two decades following 2015 but, even at the sharply reduced price resulting from <b>oversupply,</b> as of 2012 cost of solar power in China remained three times that of power produced by conventional coal-fired power plants.|$|E

40|$|Adherence to oral hypoglycemic agentsused in the {{management}} of diabetes is suboptimal, yet adherence is not rou-tinely measured in clinical practice, in part because no gold standard measurement exists. 1, 2 Persistence, a measure of refill adherence, holds promise as a practical measure in systems of care where long-term pharmacy claims data are available, such as in the Veterans Administration (VA). In the VA system, calculating a per-sistence measurement imposes minimal burden to the provider or patient because the refill data are integrated with the elec-tronic medical record (EMR). Persistence, however, is a proxy for ad-herence, and filling large prescriptions (≥ 90 -day supplies) has been associated with <b>oversupplies.</b> 3 Existing literature on <b>oversupplies,</b> which we refer to as over-persistence, is limited and has not been ex-amined in the context of diabetes.
