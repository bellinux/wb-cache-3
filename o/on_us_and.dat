5|$|The 1st Armoured Regiment {{was formed}} as a tank unit in the new Australian Regular Army on 7 July 1949. Initially, the new {{regiment}} was equipped with Churchill tanks, although this was only a temporary measure until Centurion tanks could be acquired. However, due to the perceived unsuitability of the Churchill and the late arrival of the new platform, the regiment was not deployed as part of Australia's commitment to the Korean War, although a number of officers served on exchange with British and US formations and the unit provided machine-gunners and signallers to Australian infantry battalions as reinforcements. Meanwhile, the infantry had to rely <b>on</b> <b>US</b> <b>and</b> British tanks for armoured support. The first Centurions finally began arriving in June 1952, with the regiment receiving 39 tanks. By this time though British and Canadian armoured units were operating in sufficient strength in Korea {{and there was no}} scope for the deployment of Australian forces.|$|E

Using economy of force, as few as 10,000 PAVN troops routed FANK forces in western and northeastern Cambodia, taking or threatening 16 of the country's 19 provincial capitals and interdicting, for various periods, all road and rail links to the capital. They also kept a wary eye <b>on</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>and</b> South Vietnamese forces, which they fully expected would {{take advantage of the}} situation.|$|E

25|$|This {{became the}} Family Jewels.

This prompted Congress to create the Church Committee in the Senate, and the Pike Committee in the House. President Gerald Ford created the Rockefeller Commission, and issued an executive order prohibiting the assassination of foreign leaders. DCI Colby leaked the papers to the press, later he stated that he believed that providing Congress with this information was the correct thing to do, and ultimately in the CIA's own interests.|$|E
