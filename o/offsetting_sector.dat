Calculating the extent of this effect, we estimate that the number of manufacturing jobs ‘hidden’ within the service sector is more than <b>offset</b> by service <b>sector</b> jobs hidden within manufacturing. This is important for government policies which target manufacturing jobs. We therefore consider whether protecting ‘manufacturing’ is a meaningful policy target.

40|$|Information {{produced}} by government does of course serve {{a number of}} purposes. First it should inform government so as to generate sound policy decisions and effective strategies. Second, {{through a variety of}} media, it should provide the general public with information to enable individuals to engage with government services and to deliver personal data that they are obliged to provide. Access {{to a wide variety of}} public sector information (PSI) is also important to enable individuals to manage their lives, operate their businesses or help make political decisions about which party to support at an election. But in the midst of such uses is the asset itself i. e. PSI and the policy for its creation, storage, management, exploitation and distribution. As a national resource one issue is whether it is a commodity to be shared freely or, in those circumstances where income can be derived from it, a product to be licensed and sold to <b>offset</b> public <b>sector</b> costs? In the UK this has been under debate for many years through analysis of Crown copyright regulation.

Joint ventures with the private sector have also been entered into for the preparation and distribution of some PSI where the private sector service provider is permitted to recoup subscriptions in return for the investment. Until recently this has been a relatively sterile debate lacking data to fuel the arguments. That has changed as a result of recent investigations which this paper now explores.

The analysis shows that (a) 48 % (1. 27 MJ/$) of the decline was associated with an inter-sector structural change in the economy (i. e. an increased contribution to the total GDP of the low energy-using commercial and institutional sector compared with the high energy-using manufacturing and heavy industry sectors); (b) 24 % (0. 62 MJ/$) was attributed to the impact of the Canadian GDP growing faster than population; (c) 22 % (0. 58 MJ/$) of the decline was associated with an overall decrease in business energy intensity. A deeper analysis of business sectors shows a positive impact of 0. 4 MJ/$ from increased energy intensity in the oil and gas <b>sector,</b> <b>offset</b> by a 0. 98 MJ/$ decline due to energy intensity declines in the other business sectors; (d) 6. 3 % (0. 17 MJ/$) of the decline was associated with an improvement in the energy intensity of households, mostly from residential energy use rather than personal transportation energy use.

One common driver {{involves}} {{the claim that}} PPPs enable the public sector to harness the expertise and efficiencies {{that the private sector}} can bring to the delivery of certain facilities and services traditionally procured and delivered by the public sector.

40|$|Recently, the {{advantage}} of country diversification relative to sector diversification has been questioned especially {{against the background of}} the European monetary and financial integration. Correct estimates of the correlation matrix are central for the evaluation of the relative diversification gains. These estimates should take into account the time-varying and asymmetric behaviour of the correlation process particularly in the context of major changes in volatility and market trends. In this paper, the ADCC (Asymmetric Dynamic Conditional Correlation) model developed by Cappiello et al. (2003) is used to estimate the conditional correlation and volatility of weekly country, sector and country/sector returns indexes over 1990 - 2003. This model offers a relatively flexible specification for the conditional correlation process that is still computationally feasible for estimation on larger portfolios. The estimation results point to an increase in the average correlation between country indexes during the last five years, {{but at the same time}} there is an important decline in the correlation between sector indexes. This trend is observed in both the euro area and the word-wide portfolios and is therefore not specific to the European integration process. At the same time, the volatility in the sector indexes has increased remarkably and in a relatively stronger way compared to the volatility in the country indexes. Both trends tend to cancel out in the calculations of optimal portfolio variance: lower <b>sector</b> correlation is <b>offset</b> by higher <b>sector</b> volatility and higher country correlation is neutralised by the relative lower volatility in country indexes. Therefore no clear trend appears from comparing the relative conditional variances of sector and country portfolios. After taking into account the effect of average returns, it turns out that country diversification is still the dominant strategy for world portfolios, whereas sector diversification is more interesting for euro area portfolios. portfolio diversification, correlation, international finance...|$|R

DL is supported by IBM BIOSes as well as most other BIOSes. The Toshiba T1000 BIOS is known to not support this properly, and some old Wyse 286 BIOSes use DL values greater or equal to 2 for hard disks. USB sticks configured as superfloppies typically get an assignment of DL = 00h or 01h, however, some rare BIOSes erroneously present USB sticks configured as removable drives as DL = 01h as well, instead of using DL = 80h. Traditionally, only values 00h and 80h were passed on by the BIOS during boot, and many boot sectors were hard-wired to work with fixed values, anyway. The Plug and Play BIOS Specification and BIOS Boot Specification (BBS) allow other devices to become bootable as well. The later also recommends that the MBR and VBR codes use DL rather than internally hardwired defaults. (NB. MS-DOS/PC DOS and OS/2 VBRs ignore the provided DL value and instead retrieve the value stored at offset +19h in the Extended BIOS Parameter Block (EBPB) or at <b>sector</b> <b>offset</b> +1FDh in DOS versions 3.2 to 3.31. Some versions of DR-DOS use DL starting with 7.02. DR-DOS 7.07 VBRs default to use DL and ignore the BPB value, but SYS /O:nnn can be used to reinvoke the old behaviour of using the BPB value or even enforce a particular boot drive unit nnn to be stored there. On FAT32 volumes, FreeDOS takes advantage of the DL value as well, whereas it does so on FAT12/FAT16 volumes only, if the BPB value is set to FFh.) ...|$|R
