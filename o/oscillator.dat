Although the <b>oscillator</b> is housed in a temperature-controlled enclosure, it is subjected to thermal variation throughout the day that results in minor changes {{in the frequency of}} the translation signal. The thermal variation results from the rotation of the satellite relative to the sun over a given 24-hour period, including the time the satellite passes through the Earth's shadow (which affected the 3:40 and 4:26 handshakes), and is complicated by the use of heaters that run when the <b>oscillator</b> temperature exits pre-determined limits. The variation in the translation frequency was calculated over several days, including the day of Flight 370's disappearance, and could be factored into the BFO measurement.|$|E

40|$|Light is {{a crucial}} input for {{circadian}} clocks. In Drosophila, short light exposure can robustly shift the phase of circadian behavior. The model for this resetting posits that circadian photoreception is cell autonomous: CRYPTOCHROME senses light, binds to TIMELESS (TIM), and promotes its degradation, which is mediated by JETLAG (JET). However, it was recently proposed that interactions between circadian neurons are also required for phase resetting. We identify two groups of neurons critical for circadian photoreception: the morning (M) and the evening (E) <b>oscillators.</b> These neurons work synergistically to reset rhythmic behavior. JET promotes acute TIM degradation cell autonomously in M and E <b>oscillators</b> but also nonautonomously in E <b>oscillators</b> when expressed in M <b>oscillators.</b> Thus, upon light exposure, the M <b>oscillators</b> communicate with the E <b>oscillators.</b> Because the M <b>oscillators</b> drive circadian behavior, they must also receive inputs from the E <b>oscillators.</b> Hence, although photic TIM degradation is largely cell autonomous, neural cooperation between M and E <b>oscillators</b> is critical for circadian behavioral photoresponses...|$|R

Their mathematical definitions possess {{a high degree}} of flexibility in the sense that through appropriate parameter choices relaxation <b>oscillators</b> can be made to exhibit qualitatively different kinds of oscillations. We study numerically four different classes of relaxation <b>oscillators</b> through their synchronization rates in one-dimensional chains with a Heaviside step function interaction and obtain the following results. Relaxation <b>oscillators</b> in the sinusoidal and relaxation regime both exhibit an average time to synchrony,, where is the chain length.

40|$|Background: Biochemical <b>oscillators</b> perform crucial {{functions}} in cells, e. g., {{they set up}} circadian clocks. The dynamical behavior of <b>oscillators</b> is best described and analyzed {{in terms of the}} scalar quantity, phase. A rigorous and useful definition for phase is based on the so-called isochrons of <b>oscillators.</b> Phase computation techniques for continuous <b>oscillators</b> that are based on isochrons have been used for characterizing the behavior of various types of <b>oscillators</b> under the influence of perturbations such as noise. Results: In this article, we extend the applicability ofthese phase computation methods to biochemical <b>oscillators</b> as discrete molecular systems, upon the information obtained from a continuous-state approximation of such <b>oscillators.</b> In particular, we describe techniques for computing the instantaneous phase of discrete, molecular <b>oscillators</b> for stochastic simulation algorithm generated sample paths. We comment on the accuracies and derive certain measures for assessing the feasibilities of the proposed phase computation methods. Phase computation experiments on the sample paths ofwell-known biological <b>oscillators</b> validate our analyses. Conclusions: The impact of noise that arises from the discrete and random nature of the mechanisms that make up molecular <b>oscillators</b> can be characterized based on the phase computation techniques proposed in this article. The concept of isochrons is the natural choice upon which the phase notion of <b>oscillators</b> can be founded. The isochron-theoretic phase computation methods that we propose can be applied to discrete molecular <b>oscillators</b> of any dimension, provided that the oscillatory behavior observed in discrete-state does not vanish in a continuous-state approximation. Analysis of the full versatility of phase noise phenomena in molecular <b>oscillators</b> will be possible if a proper phase model theory is developed, without resorting to such approximation...|$|R
