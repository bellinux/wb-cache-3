5|$|Despite being {{designed}} {{before a}} low radar cross-section (RCS) and other stealth factors were ever a consideration, a Royal Aircraft Establishment technical note of 1957 stated {{that of all}} the aircraft so far studied, the Vulcan appeared by far the simplest radar echoing object, due to its shape: <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two components contributed significantly to the echo at any aspect, compared with three or more on most other types.|$|E
5|$|During {{the tour}} matches, which were usually played {{consecutively}} with <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> no days between fixtures, Bradman rotated {{the trio of}} openers, so one would generally be rested while the other two opened,N- but in the Tests, Morris and Barnes were preferred. Bradman accommodated Brown in his first-choice team by playing him out of position in the middle order {{in the first two}} Tests and against Worcestershire and the MCC, when he fielded the strongest XI. However, Brown appeared uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role, and after making 73 runs at 24.33 in the first two Tests, he was dropped.|$|E
5|$|Fat Tony & Co. was {{confirmed}} on 3 August 2013, with series production beginning on 5 August 2013.

Based on Tony Mokbel, the series covers the manhunt for Mokbel that lasted 18 months, and dismantled his drug empire. It was filmed in Greece. It first aired on 23 February at 8.40pm on Channel 9.|$|E

5|$|Gastroenteritis {{typically}} involves both {{diarrhea and}} vomiting, or less commonly, presents with <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> the other. Abdominal cramping {{may also be}} present. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a viral agent, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral causes may also be associated with fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, the cause {{is less likely to}} be viral and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections may be associated with severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|He {{has been}} called the radical {{conservative}} of his day — not a bad designation of a complex mind, clear sighted, cautious, perhaps at bottom pessimistic in areas where thinkers we would label 'progressive' felt less difficulty in taking a stand; never content to select <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two elements in a complicated equation in order to build a quick-order policy or program; far ranging enough in intellect to take in the whole sum of the factors, and comprehend their often contradictory effects.|$|E

5|$|Vanajan Autotehdas {{was always}} a small company, {{employing}} about 400 people in 1968, and in the 1960s its market share was barely 5% in Finland. Almost all Vanajas were sold for the domestic market; only a few units were exported. Vanaja vehicles became known for their robust construction and high degree of customisation. The number of Vanaja bus chassis and lorries totalled 7,140 units; this consists of 260 lorry and 66 bus chassis models; for 116 lorry models <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two units were produced. Vanajas had a good reputation and they are nowadays valued by vintage vehicle enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|Venture kept to {{a steady}} {{bimonthly}} schedule for ten issues, but its circulation never reached a sustainable level, and it was canceled in mid-1958.

An anthology drawn from the magazine's fiction, No Limits, was published in 1964 by Ballantine Books, attributed to Joseph Ferman as editor.|$|E

5|$|A left-handed opening batsman, Morris {{played in}} all five Tests, partnering the {{right-handed}} Sid Barnes in three Tests; Barnes {{was injured in}} the Third and Fourth Tests. Barnes was unable {{to open in the}} former and did not play in the latter. Three opening batsmen were taken on the tour, with Bill Brown being the reserve. During the tour matches, which were usually played consecutively with <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> no days between fixtures, Bradman rotated the trio, so one would generally be rested while the other two opened.N- Notable exceptions occurred in the Test series and the opening match against Worcestershire and the clash against the MCC. In those matches, Australia fielded its first-choice team; Brown played out of position in the middle order, while Morris and Barnes opened. A very occasional left-arm unorthodox spin bowler, Morris delivered only 35 overs during the first-class matches, including eight in the Tests. He took two wickets, both outside the Test arena.|$|E
5|$|Bardou-Jacquet {{wanted to}} compose the {{advertisement}} {{with as little}} computer-generated imagery as possible, believing that the final product would be that much more appealing to its audience. To this end, he set two months aside {{for the creation of}} hundreds of conceptual drawings detailing various possible interactions between the parts, and a further four months for practical testing and development. For the testing phase, the script was broken into small segments, each comprising <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two interactions. Ideas deemed unworkable by the testing crew, such as airbag explosions and collisions between front and rear sections of the car, were abandoned, and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the full and final sequence was developed.|$|E
5|$|Because an ASIC is (by definition) {{specific}} {{to a given}} application, it can be fully optimized for that application. As a result, for a given application, an ASIC tends to outperform a general-purpose computer. However, ASICs are created by UV photolithography. This process requires a mask set, which can be extremely expensive. A mask set can cost over a million US dollars. (The smaller the transistors required for the chip, the more expensive the mask will be.) Meanwhile, performance increases in general-purpose computing over time (as described by Moore's law) tend to wipe out these gains in <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two chip generations. High initial cost, and the tendency to be overtaken by Moore's-law-driven general-purpose computing, has rendered ASICs unfeasible for most parallel computing applications. However, some have been built. One example is the PFLOPS RIKEN MDGRAPE-3 machine which uses custom ASICs for molecular dynamics simulation.|$|E

5|$|Between 1916—when the {{university}} introduced a Doctorate of Philosophy for research—and 1939, {{there were few}} post-graduate students, and <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two undergraduates took Arabic in final examinations each year.

5|$|Bronze working {{developed}} in Scotland from about 2000 BCE. As elsewhere in Europe, {{it was in}} this period that hillforts of varying size and form were first introduced. Some had timber palisades and others ditches and ramparts. These included the occupation of Eildon hill near Melrose in the Scottish Borders, from around 1000 BCE, which accommodated hundreds of houses on a fortified hilltop. Traprain Law in East Lothian, had a 20-acre enclosure, sectioned in two places west of the summit, made up of a coursed, stone wall with a rubble core. The occupation of Castle Rock at Edinburgh and Burnswark in Dumfries and Galloway, also date from this time. Additionally, there were much smaller forts that were domestic in scale and which would have housed <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two families. The function of these forts have been debated, with some stressing their military role and others their importance as symbolic centres of local society.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{creative}} differences, Kuntz {{backed out of}} the project, but created an adventure module that would be published {{at the same time as}} Gygax's first book. Gygax continued to painstakingly put Castle Zagyg together on his own, but even this slow and laborious process came to a complete halt when Gygax suffered a serious stroke in April 2004 and then another one a few weeks later. Although he returned to his keyboard after a seven-month convalescence, his output was reduced from 14-hour work days to <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two hours per day. Finally in 2005, Castle Zagyg Part I: Yggsburgh, the first book in the six-book series, appeared. Later that year, Troll Lord Games also published Castle Zagyg: Dark Chateau (2005), the adventure module written for the Yggsburgh setting by Rob Kuntz. Jeff Talanian helped with the creation of the dungeon, eventually resulting in publication of the limited edition CZ9: The East Marks Gazetteer (2007).|$|E

5|$|In the {{military}} sphere, {{the title of}} comes primi ordinis was granted {{to a group of}} senior tribuni. These included (1) the commander of the protectores domestici, who by 350 was known as the comes domesticorum; (2) some tribuni of scholae: after c. 400, scholae commanders were routinely granted the title on appointment; (3) the commanders of a brigade of two twinned comitatus regiments were apparently styled comites. (Such twinned regiments would always operate and transfer together e.g. the legions Ioviani and Herculiani); (4) finally, some tribunes without a regimental command (tribuni vacantes), who served as staff-officers to the emperor or to a magister militum, might be granted the title. These officers were not equal in military rank with a comes rei militaris, who was a corps commander (usually of a smaller diocesan comitatus), rather than the commander of <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two regiments (or none).|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev also {{proposed}} to restructure Soviet high schools. While {{the high schools}} provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few Soviet youths went on to university.

In practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.|$|E
