2500|$|In {{response}} to the flight of Yuri Gagarin as the first man in space, Kennedy in 1961 committed the United States to landing {{a man on the}} Moon {{by the end of the}} decade. [...] At the time, the administration believed that the Soviet Union would be able to land a man on the Moon by 1967, and Kennedy saw an American Moon landing as critical to the nation's global prestige and status. [...] His pick for NASA administrator, James E. Webb, however pursued a broader program incorporating space applications such as weather and communications satellites. [...] During this time the Department of Defense pursued military space applications such as the Dyna-Soar spaceplane program and the Manned <b>Orbiting</b> <b>Laboratory.</b> [...] Kennedy also had elevated the status of the National Advisory Space Council by assigning the Vice President as its chair.|$|E

[...] By agreement with the Department of Defense, NASA {{took the lead in}} this area, although the division continued to participate in occasional projects. [...] The division continued {{to take the lead in}} medical support for programs for which the Air Force was the lead agency, such as the Manned <b>Orbiting</b> <b>Laboratory.</b> [...] The transfer of space medicine to NASA made it apparent by 1970 that the facilities at Holloman Air Force Base were no longer cost effective, and the 6571st Aeromedical Research Laboratory was inactivated in December.|$|E

40|$|Human {{factors in}} a low-gravity {{environment}} became important {{with the beginning}} of manned space flight programs. The costs and dangers associated with actual space experiments necessi-tated the development of reduced-gravity simulation techniques. Since parabolic flight is rhe only way to produce approximately the same physical conditions as orbital space flight, it is the only technique acceptable for many human factors studies. However, the shortness of periods at fhe desired gravity level and the high gravity levels of the pre- and post-parabola flight compromise the effectiveness of the technique. In spite of its faults, this technique has been used to produce many meaningful studies. These studies have done much to increase our limited knowledge of reduced-gravity human factors. I t appears that this technique {{will continue to be a}} main source of low-gravity data, until the era of manned <b>orbiting</b> <b>laboratories...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{convection}} is a dominant mass transport mechanism when materials are solidified on Earth's surface. This convection is caused by gradients in density (and therefore gravitational force) that are brought about by gradients in temperature, composition or both. Diffusion of solute is therefore dwarfed by convection and the study of fundamental parameters, such as dendrite tip shape and growth velocity in the absence of convection is nearly impossible. Significant experimental work has therefore been carried out in <b>orbiting</b> <b>laboratories</b> with the intent of minimizing convection by minimizing gravity. One of the best known experiments of this kind is the Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment (IDGE), supported by NASA. Naturally such experiments are costly and one objective of the present investigation is to develop an experimental method whereby convection can be halted, in solidification and other experiments, on the Earth's surface. A second objective is to use the method to minimize convection resulting from the residual accelerations suffered by experiments in microgravity...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”We {{investigate}} {{the reliability of}} radio channel sim-ulators in capturing the important properties of radio channels throughout a well-specified environment. Indoor environments for which the geometric layout and material properties of surfaces are known lend themselves to such site-specific simulation. Our aim is to assess the performance of this approach by comparing its predictions with measurements in a specific environment. The measurements are made on 18 paths in the <b>ORBIT</b> <b>Laboratory</b> of Rutgers Universityâ€™s WINLAB; and the simulator we use is the WiSE ray-tracing tool developed by Bell Labs. The comparisons are made for three parameters that largely characterize a radio pathâ€™s behavior: Path loss; Ricean K-factor; and RMS delay spread. The measurements are made over a 1 -GHz bandwidth centered on 3. 5 GHz. The comparisons show good agreement over the set of paths measured and simulated, establishing confidence that a well-designed radio simulator can be used reliably in system studies. I...|$|R
