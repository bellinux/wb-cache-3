5|$|Although {{other firms}} {{expressed}} interest to Kates and Rogers Majestic {{in using the}} tubes, issues with acquiring patents prevented him, Rogers Majestic, or the University of Toronto from patenting the tubes anywhere outside Canada until 1955, and the patent application was not accepted in the United States until March 1957, six years after filing. By then, research and use of vacuum tubes was heavily waning {{in the face of}} the rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>superior</b> transistor, preventing any re-visitation of Bertie or similar machines.

5|$|By about noon, the Confederates {{had formed}} an attack line {{and were in}} {{position}} to advance on the works. Because of the forest {{on the west side}} of the Mauckport Road, a company of men dismounted and attacked the works head on. They were repulsed three times, but the Legion suffered a casualty during the second wave. Simultaneously, the Confederates launched a flanking maneuver on the eastern wing of the defensive works. The initial flanking attempt was prevented because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>superior</b> weapons held by the thirty Legion soldiers on that wing. They were equipped with Henry rifles capable of firing fourteen rounds before reloading, and were able to keep the Confederates pinned down in the open field for about twenty minutes.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of the maxillary sinus can be {{referred}} to the upper back teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with the lining of the sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the roots of the upper back teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis can be perceived as maxillary toothache, and neoplasms of the sinus (such as adenoid cystic carcinoma) can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>superior</b> alveolar nerves occurs. Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon Valsalva maneuvers or tilting the head forward.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{directly}} {{ordering the}} aircraft from McDonnell Douglas, the Australian Government purchased its F/A-18s through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.

5|$|Russia built {{a number}} of ironclads, {{generally}} copies of British or French designs. Nonetheless, there were real innovations from Russia; the first true type of ironclad armored cruiser, General-Admiral of the 1870s, {{and a set of}} remarkably badly designed circular battleships referred to as 'popovkas' (for Admiral Popov, who conceived the design). The Russian Navy pioneered the wide-scale use of torpedo boats during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, mainly out of necessity because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>superior</b> numbers and quality of ironclads used by the Turkish navy. Russia expanded her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and battleships, but the ships were manned by inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership, which enhanced their defeat in the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905.|$|E

5|$|Within {{months of}} his {{admission}} to the bar, Benjamin argued his first case before the Supreme Court of Louisiana and won.

5|$|On 27 June, the {{invasion}} force, some 350–400 ships and 60,000–100,000 men, set sail for Cyprus. It landed unopposed at Salines, near Larnaca on the island's southern shore on 3 July, and marched towards the capital, Nicosia. The Venetians had debated opposing the landing, {{but in the}} face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>superior</b> Ottoman artillery, {{and the fact that}} a defeat would mean the annihilation of the island's defensive force, it was decided to withdraw to the forts and hold out until reinforcements arrived. The Siege of Nicosia began on 22 July and lasted for seven weeks, until 9 September. The city's newly constructed trace italienne walls of packed earth withstood the Ottoman bombardment well. The Ottomans, under Lala Mustafa Pasha, dug trenches towards the walls, and gradually filled the surrounding ditch, while constant volleys of arquebus fire covered the sappers' work. Finally, the 45th assault, on 9 September, succeeded in breaching the walls after the defenders had exhausted their ammunition. A massacre of the city's 20,000 inhabitants ensued. Even the city's pigs, regarded as unclean by Muslims, were killed, and only women and boys who were captured to be sold as slaves were spared. A combined Christian fleet of 200 vessels, composed of Venetian (under Girolamo Zane), Papal (under Marcantonio Colonna) and Neapolitan/Genoese/Spanish (under Giovanni Andrea Doria) squadrons that had belatedly been assembled at Crete by late August and was sailing towards Cyprus, turned back when it received news of Nicosia's fall.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, 1880, Cabaniss {{graduated}} from the academy and was sent home to await his orders. He was assigned on August 17 of that year to the USS Swatara {{as a part of}} the Asiatic Squadron. For sixteen months, the ship was docked in Kobe, Japan, during which time Cabaniss earned himself a positive reputation with other sailors. Crew mates described him as always being happy, with an intimidating, six-foot-tall physique but a personality that did not match. His disciplined nature remained; he reportedly was one of the best-behaved sailors, who spent all of his time either carrying out his duties or practicing to be a better officer. Cabaniss was never admonished for shore misconduct, a considerable issue for most other new officers and sailors. He was reportedly a favorite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>superior</b> officers stationed in Kobe, and was appointed to a spot on the admiral's staff as a reward for his conduct. Cabaniss was preparing for an examination for promotion early in February 1882.|$|E

5|$|The Penokean Mountain Range {{formed in}} the Penokean orogeny 1880 to 1830 million years ago, when an oceanic island arc called the Pembine–Wausau terrane {{collided}} with the southern margin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Superior</b> craton. From 1880 to 1850 million years ago, the region was volcanically active. This volcanism ceased 1850 million years ago when a fragment of Archean crust arrived from the South at the subduction zone. Collision of this Archean crust in the south with the Superior craton in the North caused a period of intense crustal shortening. Rocks of the Pembine–Wassau terrane were thrust up over and onto the Superior craton, forming a mountain range that covered all but the northernmost portion of Lake Superior, crossed parts of three US states (south-central Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan), and continued to the southernmost tip of Ontario, Canada. Loading of the lithosphere by these thrust sheets caused it to flex downwards, forming a foreland basin at around 1850 million {{years ago in the}} south and 1835 million years ago in the north. The Rove Formation was deposited in the northern basin. In the southern basin, crustal thickening caused high-grade metamorphism of the sedimentary fill by 1830 million years ago. A series of post-orogenic plutons intruded into the overlying rocks 1830 million years ago,; these plutons mark the end of the Penokean orogeny.|$|E

Wright Street curves to the northeast and then the east crossing into the westernmost section of the City of Marquette. As Wright Street continues eastward, it runs through a residential section along part of the city line before completely crossing into Marquette. The roadway passes the Holy Cross Cemetery and {{the north side of the}} campus of Northern Michigan University (NMU). The northern main entrance to campus is located at the intersection with CR550 (Sugar Loaf Avenue) and Tracy Avenue.

5|$|When he was18, Buxton {{returned}} to work with his old master, James Heap, as a journeyman. Heap often took Buxton on country walks in his spare time. The two collected herbs for diet drinks, either for Heap's use or to share with his neighbours. They often found plants of whose names they were ignorant, and so Buxton bought a copy of Culpeper's Complete Herbal. However, as he found the supposedly medicinal properties of the plants fanciful and the descriptions inaccurate, he soon became dissatisfied with it. In 1808 he procured a copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>superior</b> Meyrick's Herbal, from which he learned the first principles of the Linnaean system. Buxton soon outgrew this book, and began to borrow or buy as many books on botany as he could. Botanical practice {{at the time was}} to collect and dry plants, but as he disliked dead plants and preferred not to remove specimens that could be enjoyed by others, his botanical studies were confined to making observations.|$|E

5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>superior</b> temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E
