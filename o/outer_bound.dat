40|$|In this fourth {{part of our}} {{multi-part}} papers, {{classes of}} interference networks with a sequence of less-noisy receivers are identified for which a successive decoding scheme achieve the sum-rate capacity.

40|$|Abstract: Analysis {{and safety}} {{considerations}} {{of chemical and}} biological processes frequently require an outer approximation of the set of all feasible steady-states. Nonlinearities, uncertain parameters, and discrete variables complicate the calculation of guaranteed <b>outer</b> <b>bounds.</b> In this paper, the problem of outer-approximating the region of feasible steady-states, for processes described by uncertain nonlinear differential algebraic equations including discrete variables and discrete changes in the dynamics, is adressed. The calculation of the <b>outer</b> <b>bounding</b> sets {{is based on a}} relaxed version of the corresponding feasibility problem. It uses the Lagrange dual problem to obtain certificates for regions in state space not containing steady-states. These infeasibility certificates can be computed efficiently by solving a semidefinite program, rendering the calculation of the <b>outer</b> <b>bounding</b> set computationally feasible. The derived method guarantees globally valid <b>outer</b> <b>bounds</b> for the steady-states of nonlinear processes described by differential equations. It allows to consider discrete variables, as well as switching system dynamics. The method is exemplified by the analysis of a simple chemical reactor showing parametric uncertainties and large variability due to the appearance of bifurcations characterising the ignition and extinction of a reaction.
