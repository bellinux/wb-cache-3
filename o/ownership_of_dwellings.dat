50|$|The tax {{could be}} {{structured}} {{in a number}} of different ways. One possible variant is to limit the scope to non-resident, non-British owners of property. This would be intended to discourage foreign <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> and free up housing stock for residents. Such a modification to the mansion tax has been suggested by Mark Field, an MP in central London, where overseas ownership of property is commonplace. There are perceptions that the high cost of housing in London is in part due to a disproportionate amount of residential property being owned by non-resident, non-tax paying foreigners, and that a modified mansion tax may alleviate this issue. Limiting the scope in this way would also limit the valuation exercise that the introduction of a mansion tax would require, as fewer properties would be impacted.|$|E

The findings are that rural poverty is severer and also chronic as compared to transitory poverty in urban centres. The main factor behind this phenomenon is the homogeneity of the rural set-up which affects the employment and wage levels adversely. On the other hand, in the urban areas, heterogeneous population with diverse occupations provides better employment and wage opportunities. Furthermore, illiteracy, landlessness, lack of <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwellings,</b> and dependency on sharecropping are the main factors accentuating rural poverty.

40|$|As Aristotle {{recognized}} in The Politics, the household is an indispensable building block of social, economic, and political life. A liberal society grants its citizens far wider berth to arrange their households than {{to choose their}} familial and marital relationships. Legal commentators, however, have devoted far {{more attention to the}} family and to marriage than to the household as such. To unpack the household, this Article applies transaction cost economics and sociological theory to interactions among household participants. It explores questions such as the structure <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwelling</b> units, the scope of household production, and the governance of activities around the hearth. Drawing {{on a wide variety of}} historical and statistical sources, the Article contrasts conventional family-based households with arrangements in, among others, medieval English castles, Benedictine monasteries, and Israeli kibbutzim. A household is likely to involve several participants and as many as three distinct relationships—that among occupants, that among owners, and that between these two groups (the landlord-tenant relationship). Individuals, when structuring these home relationships, typically pursue a strategy of consorting with intimates. This facilitates informal coordination and greatly reduces the transaction costs of domestic interactions. Utopian critics, however, have sought to enlarge the scale of households, and some legal advocates have urged household members to write formal contracts and take disputes into court. These commentators fail to appreciate the great advantages, in the home setting, of informally associating with a few trustworthy intimates...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{individual}} home ownership {{has been a}} common phenomenon in recent decades across {{a broad range of}} developed economies. Its growth has been associated with ideas of extending individual property ownership and with a pervasive privatism and individualism in contemporary society. Home ownership is seen as an essential component of the middle class, or indeed classless, lifestyle and as a key ingredient in ideological constructs such as the American or Australian dream or the British property-owning democracy. In both specialist housing debates and within mainstream discussions in sociology or politics there has been increasing interest in the significance of home ownership in processes of social restratification and political realignment. From a variety of perspectives there is a strong message of societies entering a new and qualitatively distinct period of social change. Whether or not these changes (for example, described as postFordist or postmodern) are indeed occurring on any scale is open to debate. However, whatever the theoretical formulation the spread of individual <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> is appropriated as a symptom of such change. And it is the evident and measurable spread of personal wealth in the form of dwellings which is often a principal element of this interest in the social significance of mass home ownership...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{advocates a}} theorized {{approach}} to second home ownership, which previously {{has been largely}} ignored in housing studies or seen as a localized problem.

The notion of “second” home is considered increasingly problematic owing partly to inherent definitional problems and partly to the growing <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> multiple <b>dwellings</b> for leisure and leisure‐related investment purposes. The growth <b>of</b> second home <b>ownership</b> is conceptualized as a form of gentrification and international comparisons highlight distinctive differences between countries and over time.

Given the existing data systems in the country, it is not found feasible to use the 'Labour Input Method' unless substantial improvements {{are made in the}} statistical system of the country. Though, it would be necessary to introduce such improvements in the statistical system, realistic estimates need to be generated in the interim-period. The Sub-committee, thus, developed an alternative method of apportioning by using estimates of labour inputs and productivity differentials of both the organised and unorganised sectors.

The study shows that privatization has presented the tenants, who had already benefitted from subsidies, with a sizeable 'national gift'.

The purpose of this survey was to obtain parents' views on the education their children were receiving, on their relationships with the teaching staff of their childrens' schools and on certain aspects of primary school organisation, and to collect information about parental attitudes and home backgrounds of the children. Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions Educational support given to children in their homes: time spent by parents with their children; interest taken by fathers in their childrens' education and upbringing; reading habits of parents (membership of library) and of child; parents' attitudes towards school work being done at home and towards helping their children with homework. Parental aspirations for their children: attitudes to school leaving age; secondary school preferences. Physical conditions {{of the home and}} neighbourhood amenities; existence of garden/yard; bath; hot water; number of bedrooms in home; play areas available and used; recreational facilities of area; public libraries; outdoor play spaces; children's clubs; societies, etc.; swimming pools; indoor recreational facilities; children's use of these and parental preferences. Parental attitudes to primary education: school starting age; changes of, and parental choice of secondary schools. Parental contacts with primary school: enquiries made and interest taken by parents when children entered school; talks with teachers (frequency and subjects discussed); opportunities provided for parents to visit schools and advantages for seeing school staff and opinion of their contacts with teachers; communications between parents and teachers. Parents' views on school organisation and teaching methods: parental preferences for combined or separate schools for infants and juniors; for streamed or mixed ability classes; parents' satisfaction with teaching methods and with their children's progress at school. Behaviour training and discipline of child: where parents felt responsibility for behaviour training of child lay; opinion on degree of control exercised by school; views on corporal punishment. Other issues: opinions on facilities at school; size of classes, and other issues parents wished to raise.
