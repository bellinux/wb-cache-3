5|$|While {{traditional}} accounts list Buddhaghosa as {{the author}} <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> works, the current consensus among scholars accepts only the Visuddhimagga and the commentaries on the first four nikayas as Buddhaghosa's work.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} aspect <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> examples of noise in European keyboard and string music before the 19th century {{is that they}} are used as sound effects in programme music. Sounds that would likely cause offense in other musical contexts are made acceptable by their illustrative function. Over time, their evocative effect was weakened as {{at the same time they}} became incorporated more generally into abstract musical contexts.|$|E
5|$|Despite vast {{differences}} in appearance and morphology, A.vulgare {{is related to}} such varied taxa as the gilled fungi of Lentinus, the poroid genus Albatrellus, the coral-like Clavicorona, and fellow tooth fungus Hericium. The relationship <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> taxa—members of the family Auriscalpiaceae of the order Russulales—has been demonstrated through molecular phylogenetics.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{pathogenic}} mutations {{have been}} identified in the prion-like domains of heterogeneous nuclear riboproteins hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 in familial cases of muscle, brain, bone and motor neuron degeneration. The wild-type form <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> proteins show a tendency to self-assemble into amyloid fibrils, while the pathogenic mutations exacerbate this behaviour and lead to excess accumulation.|$|E
5|$|The Natural History is {{generally}} divided into the organic {{plants and animals}} and the inorganic matter, although there are frequent digressions in each section. The encyclopedia also notes the uses made <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> by the Romans. Its description of metals and minerals is valued for its detail {{in the history of}} science, being the most extensive compilation still available from the ancient world.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> hallmarks is {{not needed}} for a diagnosis. A clinical diagnosis is considered made when, with lentigines present there are 2 other symptoms observed, such as ECG abnormalities and ocular hypertelorism, or without lentigines, 3 of the above conditions are present, with a first-degree relative (i.e. parent, child, sibling) with a clinical diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{alterations}} like perming, coloring can {{be carried}} out to change the perceived color and texture <b>of</b> hair. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> are temporary alterations because permanent alterations are not possible at this time.|$|R
50|$|Further {{improvement}} {{has resulted}} from continuing {{efforts by the}} U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Transport Canada, {{as well as by}} the bus industry and various safety advocates. As <b>of</b> 2016, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> standards are still in effect.|$|R
5|$|With the {{exception}} <b>of</b> Cerberus, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> ships were sold off for scrap {{during the first}} decade of the 20th century. Cerberus was sold in 1924 and used as a breakwater; her wreck still exists off Half Moon Bay in Australia.|$|R
5|$|There are {{at least}} five Zeus models {{mentioned}} in various sources, A, B, C, S and X2, the last of which became Spartan. None of the sources explicitly list the differences <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> in a single table. Different sources appear to confuse measures between the Zeus A, B and Spartan. The A and Spartan figures are taken from US Strategic and Defensive Missile Systems 1950–2004, B from the Bell Labs history.|$|E
5|$|While {{residents}} {{along the}} NY63 corridor {{are against the}} increased truck traffic along the corridor (spurred by the North American Free Trade Agreement), most of those same residents, along with other groups, also fought the proposed expressway. The general consensus <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> groups is that NYSDOT should impose restrictions on the NY63 corridor and force trucks to remain on I-390 and the Thruway to travel between Buffalo and Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indirect}} {{effect of the}} boom was the growth of gambling and prostitution in many communities. These activities had not been uncommon in Texas before the boom, but the wealth brought by the oil industry, as well as difficulties in enhancing the laws and the law enforcement agencies, created many new opportunities for illegal businesses and organized crime. Many communities developed casino and red-light districts; notably the gaming empire in Galveston, which attracted wealthy businessmen from Houston and lasted into the 1950s, was the longest lasting <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these.</b> Prostitution, which had always been present in the state, flourished in the boom towns, which were crowded with single men earning relatively high wages. The onset of Prohibition and the state government's reluctance to enforce vice laws only encouraged the growth of gambling and bootlegging during this period.|$|E
2500|$|Neighbouring islands include Saint Barthélemy (French), Anguilla (British), Saba (Dutch), Sint Eustatius [...] "Statia" [...] (Dutch), Saint Kitts and Nevis (independent, {{formerly}} British).

5|$|Charles Doolittle Walcott {{found in}} the Burgess Shale nine almost {{complete}} fossils of Opabinia regalis {{and a few of}} what he classified as Opabinia media, and published a description <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> in 1912. The generic name is derived from Opabin pass between Mount Hungabee and Mount Biddle, southeast of Lake O'Hara, British Columbia, Canada. In 1966–1967 Harry B. Whittington found another good specimen, and in 1975 he published a detailed description based on very thorough dissection of some specimens and photographs of these specimens lit from a variety of angles. Whittington's analysis did not cover Opabinia media: Walcott's specimens of this species could not be identified in his collection. In 1960 Russian paleontologists described specimens they {{found in the}} Norilsky region of Siberia and labelled Opabinia norilica, but these fossils were poorly preserved, and Whittington did not feel they provided enough information to be classified as members of the genus Opabinia.|$|E
5|$|I-70 {{serves as}} the main {{thoroughfare}} of the valley, the only area traversed by the freeway in the state {{with more than a}} few hundred residents. Richfield is the largest city along I-70 in the state. The highway enters the valley just north of Big Rock Candy Mountain, a mountain named for a song attributed to Harry McClintock. The highway proceeds northeast along {{the western edge of the}} valley, passing to the west of the communities of the valley, including Joseph, Monroe, Elsinore, and Richfield. As I-70 approaches Salina it cuts across the valley passing to the south of that town. The highway avoids the downtown areas <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> cities. The portion between Richfield and Salina is the busiest, with an annual average daily traffic of 11,535vehicles in 2006. In the Sevier Valley, I-70 was built parallel to U.S. Route 89.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the present}} state of {{continental}} drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth (the Coriolis effect).|$|E
50|$|Although the BWCA Wilderness Act {{was never}} officially amended, several {{attempts}} were made between 1979 and 1982 by the state <b>of</b> Minnesota. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> were eventually upheld by the 8th District Court. The Supreme Court of the United States refused to review this opinion in 1982.|$|R
500|$|... "I think 'Don't Bother' {{has a lot}} of pain in it as a song, {{but also}} a lot of humour and sarcasm. Yes, it is a way <b>of</b> exorcising <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> feelings, a form of catharsis, getting rid <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> those {{emotions}} that torture us women at some point in our lives" ...|$|R
50|$|If a {{collection}} of sets is locally finite, the collection <b>of</b> <b>all</b> closures <b>of</b> <b>these</b> sets is also locally finite. The {{reason for this is}} that if an open set containing a point intersects the closure of a set, it necessarily intersects the set itself, hence a neighborhood can intersect at most the same number of closures (it may intersect fewer, since two distinct, indeed disjoint, sets can have the same closure). The converse, however, can fail if the closures of the sets are not distinct. For example, in the finite complement topology on R the collection <b>of</b> <b>all</b> open sets is not locally finite, but the collection <b>of</b> <b>all</b> closures <b>of</b> <b>these</b> sets is locally finite (since the only closures are R and the empty set).|$|R
5|$|The Italian Lives {{constitute}} {{the first two}} volumes of Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal. The poet, journalist, and literary historian James Montgomery contributed the biographies of Dante, Ariosto, and Tasso. Historian of science Sir David Brewster contributed that of Galileo. Mary Shelley contributed the rest: Petrarch, Boccaccio, Lorenzo de'Medici, Marsiglio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Angelo Poliziano, Bernardo Pulci, Luca Pulci, Luigi Pulci, Cieco Da Ferrara, Burchiello, Bojardo, Berni, Machiavelli, Guicciardini, Vittoria Colonna, Guarini, Chiabrera, Tassoni, Marini, Filicaja, Metastasio, Goldoni, Alfieri, Monti, and Ugo Foscolo. Although {{there has been some}} confusion regarding the attribution of these biographies, the Livess recent editor, Tilar Mazzeo, notes that Shelley claimed authorship <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> and granted Montgomery and Brewster's authorship of the others in her letters.|$|E
5|$|The user {{interface}} and game controls are unified across the PC and home console versions. Players {{have the option}} of using any combination of a keyboard, mouse, and game controller to play; the former two are achieved on PlayStation 4 via wireless or USB keyboard and mouse. By default, the system is navigated through drag and drop windows on PC. Navigation on the PlayStation version of Final Fantasy XIV is accomplished with a XrossMediaBar-like interface due to platform users' familiarity with the set-up. This bar is used to access all menus, maps, logs, and configuration options. The head-up display for both versions includes a message log, party status menu, mini-map, and action bar. The player may customize the location <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> elements.|$|E

30|$|The same {{analysis}} was conducted on <b>all</b> types <b>of</b> violations.
