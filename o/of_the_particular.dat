The Gaza cuisine is {{a variation of the}} Levant cuisine, but is more diverse in seafood and spices. Gaza's inhabitants heavily consume chili peppers too. Meals are usually eaten in the household but dining out has become prominent particularly during parties where light meals like salads, bread dips and skewered meats are served.|$|E
5|$|Having {{restored}} his surviving {{forces to}} order, and {{aware of the}} confusion in Bryennios's forces, Alexios decided to counter-attack. The plan he laid out made far greater use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> skills of his Turkish horse-archers. He divided his force into three commands, of which two were left behind in ambush. The other, formed from the Immortals and the Chomatenoi under Alexios's own command, was not arrayed in one continuous line, but broken up in small groups, intermingled with other groups of Turkish horse-archers. This command would advance on the rebels, attack them, then feign retreat and draw them into the ambush.|$|E
5|$|Investigation of shipwrecks in {{vicinity}} of Pedra Branca. Singapore had duties to investigate hazards to navigational safety and to publish information about such hazards in its capacity as a lighthouse operator, {{and under the}} United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea. Therefore, by investigating and reporting on shipwrecks and maritime hazards within Pedra Branca's territorial waters Singapore had acted in accordance with best practice and not Ã  titre de souverain. The circumstances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> investigations also meant that Singapore's ability to carry them out was not based on its sovereignty over the island.|$|E

5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, {{it is crucial that}} the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> international law norm.|$|E
5|$|Roa Bastos was an {{exponent}} of the Neobaroque {{style that}} brought Latin American literature {{to the fore}} internationally in the mid-20th century. Among others, the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda is also associated with this school of writing. The style uses a complex system of metaphors that are often very {{closely tied to the}} land, flora and culture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> writer, {{especially in the case of}} Roa Bastos. Magic realism is a Neobaroque concept that applies such systems of metaphor to otherwise realistic settings (Yo, el Supremo being a notable example of the form). The Neobaroque style was used by many Paraguayan writers in exile after 1947 and until the 1980s. At the core of much of the work from this group are ideas of political freedom and the emancipation of their homeland.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the G-spot is typically reported as being about 50 to 80mm (2 to 3in) inside the vagina, on the front wall. For some women, stimulating this area creates a more intense orgasm than clitoral stimulation. The G-spot area {{has been described as}} needing direct stimulation, such as two fingers pressed deeply into it. Attempting to stimulate the area through sexual penetration, especially in the missionary position, is difficult because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> angle of penetration required.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no simple}} way of {{differentiating}} a venomous snake from a non-venomous one merely by using a scale character. Finding out whether a snake is venomous or not is correctly done by identification of the species of a snake {{with the help of}} experts, or in their absence, close examination of the snake and using authoritative references on the snakes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> geographical region to identify it. Scale patterns help to indicate the species and from the references, it can be verified if the snake species is known to be venomous or not.|$|E
5|$|Van der Weyden {{developed}} {{the conventions of}} northern portraiture and was hugely influential on the following generations of painters. Rather than merely follow van Eyck's meticulous attention to detail, van der Weyden created more abstract and sensual representations. He was highly sought after as a portraitist, yet there are noticeable similarities in his portraits, likely because he used and reused the same underdrawings, which met common ideals of rank and piety. These were then adapted to show the facial characteristics and expressions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> sitter.|$|E

5|$|Wagner first {{conceived}} {{the work in}} April 1857 but did not finish it until twenty-five years later. It was Wagner's last completed opera and in composing it he took advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> acoustics of his Bayreuth Festspielhaus. Parsifal was first produced at the second Bayreuth Festival in 1882. The Bayreuth Festival maintained a monopoly on Parsifal productions until 1903, when the opera was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} 19th century, the major {{shipping}} lines financed Swedish emigrant agents {{and paid for}} the production of large quantities of emigration propaganda. Much of this promotional material, such as leaflets, was produced by immigration promoters in the U.S. Propaganda and advertising by shipping line agents was often blamed for emigration by the conservative Swedish ruling class, which grew increasingly alarmed at seeing the agricultural labor force leave the country. It was a Swedish 19th-century clichÃ© to blame the falling ticket prices and the pro-emigration propaganda of the transport system for the craze of emigration, but modern historians have varying views about the real importance of such factors. Brattne and Ãkerman have examined the advertising campaigns and the ticket prices as a possible third force between push and pull. They conclude that neither advertisements nor pricing had any decisive influence on Swedish emigration. While the companies remain unwilling, , to open their archives to researchers, the limited sources available suggest that ticket prices did drop in the 1880s, but remained on average artificially high because of cartels and price-fixing. On the other hand, H. A. Barton states that the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped drastically between 1865 and 1890, encouraging poorer Swedes to emigrate. The research of Brattne and Ãkerman has shown that the leaflets sent out by the shipping line agents to prospective emigrants would not so much celebrate conditions in the New World, as simply emphasize the comforts and advantages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> company. Descriptions of life in America were unvarnished, and the general advice to emigrants brief and factual. Newspaper advertising, while very common, tended to be repetitive and stereotyped in content.|$|E
5|$|Penelope was {{completed}} at Devonport Dockyard on 27 June 1868 {{for the cost}} of Â£196,789 and served in the Channel Fleet until June 1869. She was then guard ship at Harwich until 1882, which included summer cruises in company {{with the rest of the}} reserve fleet. She was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Particular</b> Service Squadron mobilised during the Russian war scare of JuneâAugust 1878. In 1882, she was at Gibraltar on the summer cruise when the Anglo-Egyptian War began and her shallow draught caused her to be sent to Egypt. Upon arrival in Alexandria, she assisted with the evacuation of European refugees for several days before the bombardment of the city began on 11 July. Penelope was the ship closest to the Egyptian forts and fired 231 rounds during the battle. The ship was only lightly damaged by Egyptian shells, with eight men wounded, one eight-inch gun damaged and one mainyard needing to be replaced. She became Rear-Admiral Anthony Hoskins's flagship when the British seized the Suez Canal to allow their troop transports to land at Ismailia. Penelope returned home after the war for a further five years service at Harwich. She was paid off in 1887, refitted, and sent to Simonstown, South Africa, as a receiving ship the following year. In January 1897, Penelope was converted to a prison-hulk and then sold for scrap on 12 July 1912 for the price of Â£1,650. The ship was broken up at Genoa, Italy, in 1914.|$|E

5|$|Philosophies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> {{sciences}} {{range from}} {{questions about the}} nature of time raised by Einstein's general relativity, to the implications of economics for public policy. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be reduced to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual psychology? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the foundations of statistics. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the philosophy of medicine. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the social sciences explore whether the scientific studies of human nature can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by values and by social relations.|$|E
5|$|Revenge was {{the ninth}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy and was ordered under the Naval Defence Act Programme of 1889. The ship was laid down by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company at their {{shipyard}} in Jarrow in Tyne and Wear, England, on 12 February 1891. She was floated out of the drydock on 3 November 1892, and completed on 22 March 1894 at a cost of Â£954,825. Upon completion, Revenge was placed in reserve at Portsmouth. Almost two years later, she mobilised there on 14 January 1896 as flagship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Particular</b> Service Squadron, soon renamed the Flying Squadron, which was formed in response to rising tensions in Europe following the Jameson Raid and Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II's telegram of support to the Boer government. The squadron was briefly attached to the Mediterranean Fleet {{in the middle of the}} year. When it was disbanded on 5 November, Revenge relieved the battleship Trafalgar as the flagship of the second-in-command of the Mediterranean Fleet.|$|E
5|$|The Z-3 formed part of {{the bomber}} {{versions}} of the Z series, it was, however, also used as a reconnaissance aircraft by the staff flight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>particular</b> unit. The engines and the general equipment were identical to the Z-2 standard; however two cameras â the Rb 50/30 and Rb 20/30 - were incorporated into the crew entry hatch. A handheld camera was issued to the crew to validate the success during bombing missions. Autopilot equipment was added later. The Z-2 and Z-3 were identical visually, and could only be distinguished from each other by the altered crew hatch on the Z-3. Owing to spacing problems because of the added camera equipment, the ammunition supply was reduced from 44 to 42 magazines. The power plant of the Z-3 was upgraded to the Bramo 323P-2. The Bramo P-2 remained the engine of all the remaining Z series variants.|$|E
