5|$|Mainstream, non-pornographic manga also {{frequently}} contains explorations <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> sex roles, although usually {{for purposes of}} exoticism or comedy {{rather than in a}} realistic manner. Some supporting characters cross-dress, such as Nuriko from Fushigi Yuugi, and some series are centred around the idea of changing sex, such as Ranma ½, whose protagonist changes sex, but not gender, when splashed with cold water. IS, a manga about two intersexual characters, won the 2007 Kodansha Manga Award in the girls' manga division. Class S is a genre of girl's fiction that tells stories about crushes between a female upperclassman and an underclassman.

5|$|Manning's {{books have}} {{received}} limited critical attention; as during her life, opinions are divided, particularly about her characterisation and portrayal of other cultures. Her works tend to minimise issues <b>of</b> <b>gender,</b> <b>and</b> {{are not easily}} classified as feminist literature. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has highlighted Manning's importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the British Empire in decline. Her works are critical of war, racism, colonialism and imperialism, and examine themes of displacement and physical and emotional alienation.|$|E
5|$|The initialism, LGBT, is {{intended}} to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures. It {{may be used to}} refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender, instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity; LGBTQ has been recorded since 1996. Those who add intersex people to LGBT groups or organizing use an extended initialism LGBTI. Some people combine the two acronyms and use the term LGBTIQ or LGBTQI. Others use LGBT+ to encompass a spectrum <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> sexuality.|$|E

40|$|With a {{specific}} {{focus on the}} themes of construction, subversion and transformation, this collection of essays makes an innovative contribution to the study <b>of</b> <b>genders</b> <b>and</b> sexual identity in the Middle Ages. Scholars {{from a variety of}} disciplinary backgrounds deal with the presentation or transformation <b>of</b> <b>gender,</b> third-gender, <b>and</b> the relationship between <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> sexual identity in fields such as literature, hagiography, and art history, from the Anglo-Saxon period to the early sixteenth century. The contributors offer in-depth analyses on specific subjects—including French romance literature, saints’ vitae, Italian visual cultures, and manuscript studies—as well as providing food for thought for scholars outside medieval studies who are interested in the themes <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> transformation <b>and</b> presentation. Engaging with current academic debates over the complexities <b>and</b> pluralities <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> identity in the Middle Ages, this volume {{is one of the first}} collections to show how the themes <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> construction <b>and</b> transformation can be applied over a wide range of fields...|$|R

It maintains the traditions of Anglican church music, with a robed choir singing psalms, anthems and responses {{in contrast to the}} great majority of churches in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney where services are generally celebrated in styles associated with Low Church and Evangelical Christian practices.

5|$|Feminism {{became a}} {{principal}} concern of musicologists in the 1980s {{as part of}} the New Musicology. Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of canon, genius, genre and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked. Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like Susan McClary, Marcia Citron and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and education of women; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> difference are among the themes examined during this time.|$|E
5|$|Gender plays a {{large role}} within Fielding's moral critique, and effeminacy is a means to emphasise a male character's moral {{shortcomings}} or problematic deviations from social and cultural traditions. Starting with Love in Several Masques, the stock characters that he relies on emphasise the deviations by recalling traditional behavioural stereotypes and in their commentary on the masculinity or femininity of other characters. The political implications for gender extend to a criticism of powerful female within the domestic and public domains. Many of the problems portrayed within the plays are {{the results of the}} domestic sphere extended into politics, especially within Tom Thumb. As Jill Campbell points out, not only does Fielding critique women in power, but the reversals <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> power serve as a way to say that private concerns are taking priority over public concerns. In his plays and his novels, women are used as a way to discuss the internal aspects of humans, which includes both emotions and morality. Although Fielding sometimes uses females to express ideal ways to act, he does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, emotions, and morality to dominate and assume power. This theme appears as early as Love in Several Masques and continues throughout, especially in prose parody Shamela where Shamela falsifies claims to virtue to control and get ahead in life.|$|E
