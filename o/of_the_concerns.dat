5|$|In September 2007 {{a public}} {{discussion}} between supporters {{and opponents of}} the mosque plan was held at Ithaca House in Stratford. Issues discussed included the legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> about the mosque, {{the extent of the}} conservative view of Islam taught by Tablighi Jamaat, their unwillingness to engage in public discourse, the extent that racism plays a role in the mosque's opposition, and the demand for larger facilities in the West Ham area to support the needs of the community.|$|E
5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> of the Irish {{discussed}} in the first letter was over what {{is now known as}} Gresham's law: debased coins would cause silver and gold coinage to be hoarded or removed from the country, which would further debase the currency. Tenant farmers would {{no longer be able to}} pay their landlords, and, after the tenants were removed, there would be fewer crops grown in Ireland; the increase of poverty and the decrease of food supply would completely ruin Ireland's economy.|$|E
5|$|There {{are ongoing}} {{programs}} {{working on a}} dengue vaccine to cover all four serotypes. Now {{that there is a}} fifth serotype this will need to be factored in. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> is that a vaccine could increase the risk of severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The ideal vaccine is safe, effective after one or two injections, covers all serotypes, does not contribute to ADE, is easily transported and stored, and is both affordable and cost-effective.|$|E

5|$|Cathedral {{officials}} also described {{the use of}} guns in a city which has a gun crime problem as irresponsible. The Bishop of Manchester, the Right Reverend Nigel McCulloch, stated that it was well known that Manchester had a gun crime problem, {{and that it was}} beyond belief that a global manufacturer would re-create one of their Cathedrals with photo-realistic quality. Insomniac, the game's developer, declined to comment, referring all inquires to Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe issued a statement, stating that they were aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> expressed by the Bishop of Manchester and the Cathedral authorities, and take them seriously. However, they added that Resistance: Fall of Man is a fantasy science fiction game and not based on reality and that they believed they had sought and received all permissions necessary. Sony also stated that it would be contacting the Cathedral on 11 June 2007 to understand their concerns in more detail. David Wilson, a Sony spokesman, told The Times that it was game-created footage, and not video or photography. Further, he compared it to science fiction shows such as Doctor Who, claiming that it was not based on reality at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{race between}} Amondson and Dodge {{was viewed as}} a way to {{determine}} which faction would lead the party in the future. Amondson achieved ballot access in Louisiana as the nominee of the Prohibition Party and in Colorado as the nominee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Concerns</b> of People Party. Dodge achieved ballot access only in Colorado, where he was listed as the nominee of the Prohibition Party. Overall, Amondson won the contest, collecting 1,896 (1,512 of those were from Louisiana) votes compared to Dodge's 140. As expected, Amondson placed well behind both major candidates (George W. Bush received 1.1million votes, and John Kerry received over 1million votes). He placed eighth in a slate of 12 candidates on Colorado's ballot (Dodge placed last, even though it was his home state). Amondson's third-place finish in four Louisiana parishes was the first time since 1960 that the Prohibition Party nominee for President out polled-all other third party candidates for president in any county.|$|E

25|$|However, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> {{with all}} CT {{scanners}}, both EBT {{and perhaps more}} so with the spiral scanners (which are more commonly used because they are less expensive to purchase), is the dose of X-Ray delivered to the patient’s body and concerns {{about the safety of}} repeated doses of X-Ray to track disease status over time.|$|E
25|$|While {{the period}} is {{generally}} {{known for its}} adoption of highly regulated and stylised literary forms, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> of writers of this period, with the emotions, folk and a self-conscious model of authorship, foreshadowed the preoccupations of the later Romantic era. In general, philosophy, politics and literature underwent a turn away from older courtly concerns towards something closer to a modern sensibility.|$|E

25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> of botany in {{the early}} 21st century is the {{location}} of type specimens, the material that {{formed the basis of}} the description that was given when the plant was named. The whereabouts of this material is sometimes discovered unexpectedly. For example, a set of 18 specimens that Baldwin gave to the American Philosophical Society in March 1819 was neglected, probably because of its small size, and was not studied until 1978. At that time, it was found to contain the type specimens of some species of Rhynchospora.|$|E
25|$|According to Lukoff and Lu the American Psychological Association {{expressed}} {{some concerns}} about the “unscientific” nature of Transpersonal psychology {{at the time of}} the petition (see above) to the APA. Rowan notes that the Association had serious reservations about opening up a Transpersonal Psychology Division. The petitions for divisional status failed to win the majority of votes in the APA council, and the division was never established. Commentators also mention that Transpersonal Psychology's association with the ideas of religion was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> that prohibited it from becoming a separate division of the APA {{at the time of the}} petition in 1984.|$|E

25|$|Most critiques can {{be divided}} into two main categories. The first group lauded the book for its {{comprehensiveness}} and the ground breaking views and analysis. The second group complained about revelation of secret documents as well as the book’s coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> among Iranian officials and domestic issues. They noted that such information might be exploited by the negotiating parties opposing Iran and concluded that publication of the book has been a dis-service to the country’s interests and national security. They also stated that the book is one-sided and the author has omitted some facts which were not in line with his or his team's interests.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{cassettes}} {{themselves were}} relatively durable, the players required regular maintenance to perform properly. Head cleaning may {{be done with}} long swabs, soaked with isopropyl alcohol, or cassette-shaped devices that could be inserted into a tape deck to remove buildup of iron-oxide from the heads, tape-drive capstan, and pinch-roller. Some otherwise normal recording tapes included sections of leader that could clean the tape heads. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> of the time however {{was the use of}} abrasive cleaning tape. Some of the cleaning tapes actually felt rough to the touch and were considered damaging to the heads. Similarly shaped demagnetizers used magnets to degauss the deck, which kept sound from becoming distorted (see Cassette demagnetizer).|$|E
25|$|Early in his career, {{under the}} {{instruction}} of his first stablemaster, Konishiki was primarily oshi-sumo specialist, preferring pushing and thrusting techniques such as oshi-dashi and tsuki-dashi that would win the bout as quickly as possible. Following his knee problems in 1988 and 1989, his balance suffered and as his weight continued to increase he began to change his style, preferring to bide his time by grabbing the opponent's mawashi and rely on his huge weight advantage to wear them out. By 1992 he was winning virtually all his matches by yori-kiri (force out), and his lack of ability to change tack once he had been sidestepped was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> raised by the Yokozuna Deliberation Committee when he was up for promotion.|$|E
