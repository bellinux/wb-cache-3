40|$|The Selective Equipment Removal System (SERS) was {{previously}} developed under the Department of Energy`s Robotics Technology Development Program to demonstrate and evaluate mobile telerobotic concepts for performing selective dismantlement using the reconfigurable dual-arm work module (DAWM). DAWM {{was designed for}} <b>overhead</b> <b>transporter,</b> crane hook, and mobile vehicle deployment. The DAWM configuration provided two 6 -degree-of-freedom (D. O. F.) hydraulic manipulators with a maximum capacity of 240 lbs in the elbows-up configuration and five additional D. O. F. supplying torso rotate for the entire positioning package, linear extension of each arm base, and base rotate for each arm (which added a seventh D. O. F. to the manipulator for elbows-up, elbows-out, and elbows-down operation). Hydraulic manipulators were selected to provide the payload capacity required for anticipated tooling and material handling needs that would be typical of heavy dismantlement tasks. The original design of the dual arm manipulation system was driven {{by the desire to}} provide maximum system versatility in the study of deployment options and orientation relative to specific task performance. In FY 1996, the program was directed to provide remote systems support for the dismantlement of the CP 5 reactor at Argonne National Lab (ANL) beginning in FY 1997. A study of the tasks involved and the available deployment options led to a rework of the DAWM designated the dual arm work platform (DAWP), which was specifically designed around crane hook deployment, reduced the base D. O. F. `s to four instead of five, and made use of the existing DAWM control system. This paper describes the evolution of the DAWM into the DAWP and the design philosophy involved...|$|E
