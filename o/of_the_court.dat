5|$|From {{an early}} period, the Court was also {{assisted}} by two Registrars, who enrolled decrees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> and orders; their books documented the legal precedent {{set by the}} court. At the same time, two Examiners were appointed to assist the Master of the Rolls in examining witnesses. The positions were regularly and openly sold by the Master of the Rolls and Lord Chancellor– Masters in Chancery went for £6,000 in 1625. To avoid the sale of offices, and due to the corruption of many court officials, an Act was passed that year requiring that fees be paid directly into the Bank of England, and creating an Accountant-General to oversee the financial aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court.</b> In 1813 the first Vice-Chancellor was appointed {{to deal with the}} increasing number of cases submitted to the Court. With the backlog growing larger, two more were appointed in 1841 under a second Act of Parliament, although this provided for two life appointments, not two new positions; when the new Vice-Chancellors died, there could be no replacements. With the dissolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> in 1873, the position of Vice-Chancellor ceased to exist.|$|E

5|$|In 1970 state {{constitutional}} amendments reorganized the Court. The constitution renamed the Appellate Court the Indiana Court of Appeals. With the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeals, the Supreme Court could choose which cases it would hear and which cases it would leave {{to the lower}} courts. Constitutional amendments also lengthened judicial terms to ten years and changed the limits on the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> to a minimum of five members and a maximum of nine. The method of selecting justices was changed from statewide election to appointment by the governor. The amendment also provided for a Judicial Nominating Commission to choose candidates. Justices also became subject to a retention election. In addition, the office of chief justice became permanent. Previously the title rotated among the justices. In 2004 the Indiana General Assembly created the Supreme Court Division of Administration, legalizing and expanding {{the role of the}} clerks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court.</b>|$|E

5|$|On the {{administrative}} end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court,</b> the Oregon Court of Appeals {{was created in}} 1969 as an intermediate appellate court in Oregon. With this change, the Supreme Court now generally does not hear appeals directly from the trial level courts of the state, with some exceptions such as death penalty cases. Other changes came in 1981 when the Oregon Legislature and justice Arno Denecke reformed the chief justice position from a simple head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> in title only, to {{the administrative}} head of the entire Oregon judicial system. The following year, 1982, the court received its first female member when Governor Vic Atiyeh appointed Betty Roberts as an associate justice. Then from 1991 to 2005 Wallace P.

5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme Court can {{overturn}} {{the decisions of}} the Oregon Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on the Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change the outcome of the case. The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, decisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process.
