40|$|Two natural soils from Bahrain {{were used}} in this study to {{investigate}} the feasibility of using Arabian <b>oil</b> <b>residue</b> as a means to stabilize collapsible saline soils. Since the presence of <b>oil</b> <b>residue</b> in soils can pose an environmental threat, the high oil retention capability of the stabilized soils is critical to its application. The behavior of the stabilized soils has been experimentally investigated in the laboratory. This study has concentrated on the evaluation of the mechanical properties of the stabilized soils, the oil retention characteristics and its bonding mechanisms, and the leaching and migration behaviors of <b>oil</b> <b>residue</b> from the stabilized soils. The geotechnical investigation results indicated that the addition of 4 % <b>oil</b> <b>residue,</b> by weight, was sufficient to significantly enhance the strength performance of the tested soils. The geochemical tests showed that the bonds formed between the oil and the soil surfaces were predominantly Van der Waal's attraction, weak hydrogen bonding, and cation and water bridging. These bonds were found to be relatively weak but stable and insensitive to leaching forces. The geo-environmental results revealed good oil retention in these samples, with less than 3 % of the <b>oil</b> <b>residue</b> by weight leached from the stabilized soils after 40 days of leaching in distilled water. The migration of oil from the stabilized soils has also been theoretically evaluated. The theoretical study utilizes the model developed by Yong et al. (1992) with a few modifications made to accommodate this particular situation. The model was solved using an explicit finite difference method, Powell's optimization technique, and experimental results. The predicted oil migration profiles were found to be slightly over-estimated as compared to the experimental profiles...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the experimental work undertaken {{to investigate the}} possibility of using <b>oil</b> lake <b>residue</b> to stabilise Sabkha soils in Kuwait. Sabkha is a problematic salt-encrusted soil deposited under arid conditions which cannot be used for construction in its natural condition. The <b>oil</b> lake <b>residue</b> being considered is the waste hydrocarbons resulting from the destruction of oil wells in Kuwait during the Gulf War, 1990. The <b>oil</b> lake <b>residue</b> covers an overall area of 24 km 2, and represents an environmental hazard that needs to be eliminated. The experimental programme included laboratory and field testing of physical properties and strength, consolidation and leaching aspects of the natural and oil mixed Sabkha soils. A soil survey of a large area was undertaken to select representative soil samples. Sabkha soils from four main locations were selected for the detailed experimental testing. <b>Oil</b> <b>residue</b> was added to the Sabkha soils at different percentages ranging from 0 % to 10 %. The focus of the experimental work was towards physical and mechanical behaviours due to low clay (less than 0. 5 %) and organic (less than 2 %) contents of the soil and high content of non-polar compounds (85 %) in the <b>oil</b> <b>residue.</b> Results showed that the addition of <b>oil</b> <b>residue</b> reduced the friction between the soil particles in the range of 5 % to 28 % and the facilitated sliding over each other resulted in an increase in the density of the compacted Sabkha soils of between 2 % to 8. 5 %. The UCS increased in the range of 34 % to 504 % of the natural values. The shear strength slightly increased with oil addition since the internal friction decreased and the cohesion intercept values increased in the range of 45 % to 150 %. The adsorbed <b>oil</b> <b>residue</b> on the cemented soil lumps acted as a waterproofing agent that reduced both salt dissolution by 56 % of the natural soil and the long term coefficient of permeability in the range of 73 % to 88 %. Under soaked conditions, the improvement in strength properties were pronounced. The natural Sabkha soil disintegrated upon soaking while oil mixed Sabkha maintained its integrity. Yield stress increased in the range of 25 % to 60 % from the values of natural soils and compression index and collapsibility decreased in the stabilised Sabkha. Field testing on 5 % stabilised compacted test beds revealed an additional increase in CBR and UCS above that of the laboratory results. Density and shear strength of field samples showed similar results as those obtained by laboratory testing. Leachability of oil from the 5 % oil stabilised Sabkha soil measured in the laboratory under a hydraulic gradient of 40 was less than 1 mg/ 1, which can be considered very low. Leachability of <b>oil</b> <b>residue</b> in the field was undetectable. The main conclusion of the work is that the addition of 5 % <b>oil</b> <b>residue</b> improved the performance of Sabkha soils especially under soaked conditions, which may result in its applications in the construction industry. These results are encouraging. However the acceptance of <b>oil</b> <b>residue</b> as a stabilising material necessitates further research and this future programme is briefly mentioned...|$|R

An eastern shale <b>oil</b> <b>residue</b> having a viscosity of 1. 30 Pa`s at 60 {degrees}C (140 {degrees}F) was blended {{with three different}} petroleum-derived asphalts that {{are known to be}} very susceptible to oxidative aging. In addition, blends of the eastern shale <b>oil</b> <b>residue</b> and the petroleum-derived asphalts are being coated onto three different aggregates that are known to be susceptible to water stripping. The oxidative age hardening portion of this study is not complete at this time. To date, information has been obtained on the unaged samples and two of the aged petroleum-derived asphalts (AAD- 1 and AAK- 1). When complete, this data will include rheological data on the unaged, RTFO-aged, and the RTFO/PAV-aged samples and infrared data on the unaged and RTFO/PAV-aged samples. With respect to the rheological data, asphalt AAD- 1 meets the specifications of a PG 58 asphalt while asphalt AAK- 1 does not. In the latter case this indicates that AAK- 1 is more appropriately evaluated at a higher temperature range. The infrared spectroscopic data obtained for the eastern shale <b>oil</b> <b>residue</b> show that it contains appreciable amounts of carbonyl and sulfoxide compound types, 0. 22 absorbance units and 0. 27 moles/L, respectively.

The influence of microbial consortium concentration and incubation time in bioremediation could be known from increasing of total heterotrophic microbial and decreasing of <b>oil</b> <b>residue</b> (g / g-soil).

40|$|Oil is {{ubiquitous}} in aquatic sediments and may affect partitioning and bioavailability of hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs). In contrast to other sedimentary hydrophobic carbon phases (natural organic matter, soot-like materials), <b>oil</b> <b>residues</b> have hardly received any attention {{as far as}} it concerns effects on HOC sorption. This paper describes experimental work dealing with such effects of oil on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) sorption to sediments. Three different oils were spiked to a marine sediment in concentrations between 0 and 100 g/kg. Sediment-water distribution coefficients (K-d) for six deuterated PAHs were then determined either directly after spiking the oil or after a semi-natural weathering process in the lab (lasting for more than 2 yr). Resulting Kd values demonstrated sorption-reducing (competitive) effects at relatively low oil concentrations and sorption-enhancing effects at high oil concentrations. The latter effects only occurred above a certain threshold [i. e., ca. 15 % (w/w) of oil on a sedimentary organic carbon basis] marking the oil concentration at which the hydrocarbon mixture presumably starts forming separate phases. Assuming a two-domain (organic carbon + oil) distribution model, oil-water distribution coefficients (K-oil) for PAHs were estimated. For fresh oils, log Koil values appeared to be very similar for different types of oils, proportional to log K-OW values and indistinguishable from log K-OC values. For weathered oils, K-oil values were also rather independent of the type of oil, but the affinity of low molecular weight PAHs for weathered <b>oil</b> <b>residues</b> appeared to be extremely high, even higher than values reported for most types of soot. Because affinities of high molecular weight PAHs for oils had not changed upon weathering, sorption of all PAHs studied (comprising a log K-OW range of 4. 6 - 6. 9) to the weathered <b>Oil</b> <b>residues</b> appeared to be more or less constant (averaged log K-oil = 7. 0 +/- 0. 24).
