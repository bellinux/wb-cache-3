5|$|The bill {{provided}} for a cash grant of $12.5 million (about $94 million at 2007 prices) to be disbursed to the Alaskan {{government in a}} number of phases, to fund the construction of mental health facilities in the territory. To meet the <b>ongoing</b> <b>costs</b> of the program, the bill transferred one million acres (4,000km²) of federally owned land in Alaska to the ownership of the proposed new Alaska Mental Health Trust as a grant-in-aid—the federal government owned about 99% of the land of Alaska at the time. The trust would then {{be able to use the}} assets of the transferred land (principally mineral and forestry rights) to obtain an ongoing revenue stream to fund the Alaskan mental health program. Similar provisions had applied in other US territories to support the provision of public facilities prior to the achievement of statehood.|$|E

The sources of money to meet these capital and operational costs are essentially either user fees, public funds or some combination of the two.

25|$|The {{availability}} of a suitable catalyst {{is also an important}} factor in deciding whether to build an alkylation plant. If sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is used, significant volumes are needed. Access to a suitable plant is required for the supply of fresh acid and the disposition of spent acid. If a sulfuric acid plant must be constructed specifically to support an alkylation unit, such construction will {{have a significant impact on}} both the initial requirements for capital and <b>ongoing</b> <b>costs</b> of operation. Alternatively it is possible to install a WSA Process unit to regenerate the spent acid. No drying of the gas takes place. This means that there will be no loss of acid, no acidic waste material and no heat is lost in process gas reheating. The selective condensation in the WSA condenser ensures that the regenerated fresh acid will be 98% weight, even with the humid process gas. It is possible to combine spent acid regeneration with disposal of hydrogen sulfide by using the hydrogen sulfide as a fuel.|$|E

Monarchy New Zealand states [...] "his figure is about one dollar per person per year", about $4.3 million per annum. An analysis by New Zealand Republic of the 2010 Budget shows the office of Governor-General costs New Zealand taxpayers about $7.6 million in <b>ongoing</b> <b>costs</b> and $11 million for Government House upgrades, a total of $18.6 million.

2500|$|When two-sided markets {{contain more}} than one {{competing}} platform, the condition of users affiliating with {{more than one}} such platform is called multihoming. Instances arise, for example, when consumers carry credit cards from more than one banking network or they continue using computers based on two different operating systems. This condition implies an increase of [...] "homing" [...] costs, which comprise all the expenses network users incur in order to establish and maintain platform affiliation. These <b>ongoing</b> <b>costs</b> of platform affiliation should be distinguished from switching costs, which refer to the one time costs of terminating one network and adopting another.|$|E

The new club would be set up to compete in the 2012–13 season, though despite several attempts by FFA to find a backer to own and run the club no individual owner or consortium of owners decided to take on the new Sydney club. With the October deadline approaching, FFA decided to push through the club by taking on the ownership role themselves. This was helped by securing $4 million from the Australian Government in a grant for the creation and <b>ongoing</b> <b>costs</b> of the club.|$|E

[...] It is estimated that he spent between £60,000 and £70,000 {{of his own money}} on new churches in Brighton alone, excluding the <b>ongoing</b> <b>costs</b> of maintaining them which he invariably bore himself. [...] Until the 1880s, when they were granted their own parishes, all of his new churches were chapels of ease to St Paul's Church; Wagner paid for several curates to look after these churches. [...] He also contributed hundreds of pounds annually to church schools and considerably more to the running of St Mary's Home for Penitents: it is known that he spent £2,500 on it in 1865, for example. [...] His housebuilding activities in Hanover and Round Hill cost at least £40,000.|$|E
2500|$|North Sydney Oval was {{the home}} ground for Northern Spirit FC, a now defunct club of the defunct Australian National Soccer League. [...] In its inaugural season in 1998, an average of 15,000 spectators {{attended}} Northern Spirit FC games at North Sydney Oval including 18,985 for their first game against Sydney Olympic FC. [...] It is generally accepted that North Sydney Oval is a poor venue for football. [...] The ground is hard and compacted to cater for cricket, and for many months there is a cricket pitch {{in the middle of}} the ground. [...] Northern Spirit FC paid to have a removable cricket pitch installed, but the <b>ongoing</b> <b>costs</b> of this were prohibitive. [...] Northern Spirit also obtained government funding for half of the new lighting installed, while NSFC paid the other half. [...] This was a major success for the club as before the new permanent lighting was installed, the older lighting was not bright enough to allow television broadcasts of night games. [...] For 2 years Northern Spirit had hired a large amount of lighting for each game to get around the problem.|$|E
