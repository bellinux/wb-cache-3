5|$|In {{yet another}} {{alternate}} timeline, Nemo speaks with Elise at her house, and learns {{that she is}} {{still in love with}} her boyfriend, Stefano. Nemo does not back down and keeps assuring her of his feelings. Finally, Elise gives in and a few years later, they get married. In one version of the story line, Elise dies in an accident on the return from the wedding. Nemo keeps her ashes, having promised her to spread them on Mars. In a far future, Nemo carries Elise's ash to Mars and spreads them on the planet's surface. Aboard the spacecraft traveling back to Earth, he meets Anna. Before they can say much to each other, the ship is destroyed by meteoroids. In an alternate version of events, he works at the same television studio but his assistant drowns instead. The assistant's widow is Anna, whom he recognizes. Another storyline has Nemo and Elise married with three children. However, their marriage is unhappy as Elise suffers from borderline personality disorder and chronic depression. She has attacks <b>of</b> <b>hysteria</b> and, despite Nemo's attempts to save their marriage, ultimately leaves him to pursue Stefano.|$|E
5|$|Skyscrapers in {{the sets}} were oblong cubes that were shot from an angle that exaggerated their height. To create {{the effect of}} {{sunlight}} glimmering off the buildings, one person would stand {{on one side of}} the cubes with a mirror, and another would stand on the opposite side with a light bulb and swing it back and forth, so the mirror could catch reflections of the swinging light and throw it back onto the skyscrapers. To create a sense <b>of</b> <b>hysteria</b> and excitement surrounding an opening night performance, a skyscraper was photographed with the camera swinging quickly up and down from side to side. While scenes from miniature sets were composed of long shots, scenes were actors were shot entirely in close-ups, which make up about 300 feet of the final film reel. Rather than attempting to put the actor into the miniature backgrounds through trick photography, the scenes were cut rapidly and successively, so the viewer first sees the actor and then the set, creating the impression they are in the same place. Sets involving actors were minimalistic, with some consisting of only a few elements like a table, telephone, two chairs, and a cigar.|$|E

40|$|A qualitative, descriptive, explorative, {{and contextual}} {{research}} design {{was selected for}} this study. The purpose was to explore the phenomenon <b>of</b> mass <b>hysteria</b> among the Basotho in Lesotho and to develop guidelines which may facilitate early intervention and better management and control <b>of</b> mass <b>hysteria</b> outbreaks. The study area covered four of the ten districts in Lesotho. Four high schools where recent outbreaks <b>of</b> mass <b>hysteria</b> have been reported {{were included in the}} study. Semi-structured individual interviews and focus group interviews were conducted to collect the data. Purposive sampling was used to select young women in high schools who experienced mass hysteria; teachers who were present during mass hysteria episodes; a parent; and traditional healers and religious leaders who were involved in treating the affected. Thirteen individual interviews were held respectively with one victim <b>of</b> mass <b>hysteria</b> from a rural area, four school principals,a parent,five traditional healers, a priest and apastor. Three focus group interviews were conducted with thirty affected young women from three different high schools and two focus group interviews were held with twenty teachers from two different high schools. The data were transcribed verbatim and content analysis was done using open and axial coding. Four themes emerged from the findings, namely: manifestations <b>of</b> mass <b>hysteria</b> among the Basotho; interventions used by the Basotho to alleviate mass hysteria; Basotho’s views about the phenomenon of mass hysteria; and effects <b>of</b> mass <b>hysteria</b> onthe Basotho. The findings show that young women in Lesotho experience both physical and psychological symptoms during mass hysteria episodes and that it has a contagious effect. The interventions used by the Basotho to alleviate mass hysteria include traditional healing, herbal remedies, exorcism and prayer. The Basotho have different views about mass hysteria attributing it to either supernatural forces or natural illness. Episodes <b>of</b> mass <b>hysteria</b> {{have a negative impact on}} the victims,their families, and those who witnessed the episodes, causing confusion, fear and anxiety. Guidelines were compiled to assist teachersand health workers to improve the management and control <b>of</b> mass <b>hysteria</b> episodes in Lesotho. Health StudiesD. Litt. et Phil.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 16th century, women were sexually stimulated by midwives in order to relieve their symptoms. Gerolamo Cardano and Giambattista della Porta believed that polluted water and fumes caused the symptoms <b>of</b> <b>hysteria.</b> Towards the end of the century, however, the role of the uterus was no longer thought central to the disorder, with Thomas Willis discovering that the brain and central nervous system were the cause of the symptoms. Thomas Sydenham argued that the symptoms <b>of</b> <b>hysteria</b> may have an organic cause. He also proved that the uterus is not the cause of symptom.|$|E

25|$|In October 1885, Freud went to Paris on a {{fellowship}} {{to study with}} Jean-Martin Charcot, a renowned neurologist who was conducting scientific research into hypnosis. He was later to recall the experience of this stay as catalytic in turning him toward the practice of medical psychopathology and away from a less financially promising career in neurology research. Charcot specialized in the study <b>of</b> <b>hysteria</b> and susceptibility to hypnosis, which he frequently demonstrated with patients on stage {{in front of an}} audience.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} {{assumptions}} of the intelligence report and following Weiss’ novel, a series of researchers and authors have, consecutively, developed suspicions about a possible involvement of Forster in a supposedly securely established hypnotherapy.

25|$|In the 16th and 17th centuries, {{something}} {{known as}} the witch hunt took place across Europe and the American colonies, during which somewhere between 40,000 and 100,000 people were killed. These people {{had been accused of}} being witches, who, according to their persecutors, worshipped the Devil, and committed acts of diabolism that included the cannibalism of children and desecration of the Eucharist. Most scholars since have agreed that these were the victims of isolated incidents <b>of</b> <b>hysteria</b> in remote, peasant communities, {{and that there was no}} religion being practised by these witches.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the few}} authors that stated Hitler {{showed signs}} <b>of</b> <b>hysteria</b> without using the Pasewalk episode and Hitler’s alleged {{treatment}} by Forster as main evidence, was the American psychoanalyst Walter C.

He and his team conducted interviews with many people who were available to the American intelligence services and who knew Hitler personally. They came to the final judgment that Hitler was “a hysterical at the edge of schizophrenia”. The study was for a long time held under lock and key and published in 1972 under the title The Mind of Adolf Hitler.|$|E
