Basic and applied research in pathogen biology, especially the elaboration of new mechanism-based anti-pathogen strategies, target discovery and drug development, rely heavily {{on the availability of}} the entire set of pathogen open reading frames, the <b>ORFeome.</b> The <b>ORFeome</b> of Cpn will enable genome- and proteome-wide systematic analysis of Cpn, which will improve our understanding of the molecular networks and mechanisms underlying and governing its pathogenesis. Results Here we report the construction of a comprehensive gene collection covering 98. 5 % of the 1052 predicted and verified ORFs of Cpn (Chlamydia pneumoniae strain CWL 029) in Gateway® ‘entry’ vectors. Based on genomic DNA isolated from the vascular chlamydial strain CV- 6, we constructed an <b>ORFeome</b> library that contains 869 unique Gateway® entry clones (83 % coverage) and an additional 168 PCR-verified ‘pooled’ entry clones, reaching an overall coverage of ~ 98. 5 % of the predicted CWL 029 ORFs. The high quality of the <b>ORFeome</b> library was verified by PCR-gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing, and its functionality was demonstrated by expressing panels of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli and by genome-wide protein interaction analysis for a test set of three Cpn virulence factors in a yeast 2 -hybrid system.

40|$|Abstract Background Recombinatorial cloning {{using the}} Gateway TM {{technology}} has been the method of choice for high-throughput omics projects, resulting in the availability of entire <b>ORFeomes</b> in Gateway TM compatible vectors. The MultiSite Gateway TM system allows combining multiple genetic fragments such as promoter, ORF and epitope tag in one single reaction. To date, this technology has not been accessible in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{one of the most}} widely used experimental systems in molecular biology, due to the lack of appropriate destination vectors. Results Here, we present a set of three-fragment MultiSite Gateway TM destination vectors that have been developed for gene expression in S. cerevisiae and that allow the assembly of any promoter, open reading frame, epitope tag arrangement in combination with any of four auxotrophic markers and three distinct replication mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract Background Alternative synonymous codons are {{not used}} with equal frequencies. In addition, the {{contexts}} of codons – neighboring nucleotides and neighboring codons – can have certain patterns. The codon context can influence both translational accuracy and elongation rates. However, {{it is not known}} how strong or conserved the codon context preferences in different organisms are. We analyzed 138 organisms (bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes) to find conserved patterns of codon pairs. Results After removing the effects of single codon usage and dipeptide biases we discovered a set of neighboring codons for which avoidances or preferences were conserved in all three domains of life. Such biased codon pairs could be divided into subtypes {{on the basis of the}} nucleotide patterns that influence the bias. The most frequently avoided type of codon pair was nnUAnn. We discovered that 95. 7 % of avoided nnUAnn type patterns contain out-frame UAA or UAG triplets on the sense and/or antisense strand. On average, nnUAnn codon pairs are more frequently avoided in <b>ORFeomes</b> than in genomes. Thus we assume that translational selection plays a major role in the avoidance of these codon pairs. Among the preferred codon pairs, nnGCnn was the major type. Conclusion Translational selection shapes codon pair usage in protein coding sequences by rules that are common to all three domains of life. The most frequently avoided codon pairs contain the patterns nnUAnn, nnGGnn, nnGnnC, nnCGCn, GUCCnn, CUCCnn, nnCnnA or UUCGnn. The most frequently preferred codon pairs contain the patterns nnGCnn, nnCAnn or nnUnCn. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Codon pair bias (CPB), {{which has}} been {{observed}} in all organisms, is a neglected genomic phenomenon that affects gene expression. CPB results from synonymous codons that are paired more or less frequently in <b>ORFeomes</b> regardless of codon bias. The effect of an individual codon pair change is usually small, but when it is amplified by large-scale genome recoding, strikingly altered biological phenotypes are observed. The utility of codon pair bias {{in the development of}} live attenuated vac-cines was recently demonstrated by recodings of poliovirus (a positive-strand RNA virus) and influenza virus (a negative-strand segmented RNA virus). Here, the L gene of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus, was par-tially recoded based on codon pair bias. Totals of 858 and 623 silent mutations were introduced into a 5 =-terminal segment of the viral L gene (designated L 1) to create sequences containing either overrepresented or underrepresented codon pairs, designated L 1 sdmax and L 1 min, respectively. Analysis revealed that recombinant VSV containing the L 1 min sequence could not be recovered, whereas the virus with the sdmax sequence showed amodest level of attenuation in cell culture. More strikingly, in mice the L 1 sdmax virus was almost as immunogenic as the parental strain but highly attenuated. Taken together, these results open a new road to attain a balance between VSV virulence and immunogenicity, which could serve as an example for the attenuation of other negative-strand, nonsegmented RNA viruses.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} and study a protein structure, large amounts of it is needed. The easiest way to obtain a protein is to recombinantly overexpress it in the well-studied bacterium Escherichia coli. However, this expression host has one major disadvantage, overexpressed proteins might not be folded or be insoluble. Within the field of structural genomics, protein production {{has become one of}} the most challenging problems and the recombinant overexpression of viral proteins has in particular proven to be difficult. The first part of the thesis concerns the recombinant overexpression of troublesome proteins in E. coli. A method has been developed to screen for soluble overexpression in E. coli at the colony level, making it suitable for screening large gene collections. This method was used to successfully screen deletion libraries of difficult mammalian proteins as well as <b>ORFeomes</b> from five herpesviruses. As a result soluble expression of previously insoluble mammalian proteins was obtained as well as crystals of three proteins from two oncogenic human herpesviruses, all linked to DNA synthesis of the viral genome. The second part of the work presented concerns the structural studies of three herpesviral proteins. SOX from Kaposi’s sarcoma associated herpesvirus is involved in processing and maturation of the viral genome. Recently SOX has also been implicated in host shutoff at the mRNA level. With this structure, we propose a substrate binding site and a likely exonucleolytic mechanism. The holoenzyme ribonucleotide reductase is solely responsible for the production of deoxyribonucleotides and regulates the nucleotide pool of the cell. The small subunit, R 2, has been solved from both Epstein Barr virus and KSHV. Both structures show disordered secondary structure elements in their apo-and mono metal forms, located close to the iron binding sites in similarity to the p 53 induced R 2 indicating that these two R 2 proteins might play a similar and important role...|$|R

40|$|Accurately {{defining}} the coding potential of an organism, i. e. all protein-encoding open reading frames (ORFs) or "ORFeome," {{is a prerequisite}} to fully understand its biology. <b>ORFeome</b> annotation involves iterative computational predictions from genome sequences combined with experimental verifications. Here we reexamine a set of Saccharomyces cerevisiae "orphan" ORFs recently removed from the original <b>ORFeome</b> annotation {{due to lack of}} conservation across evolutionarily related yeast species. We show that many orphan ORFs produce detectable transcripts and/or translated products in various functional genomics and proteomics experiments. By combining a naïve Bayes model that predicts the likelihood of an ORF to encode a functional product with experimental verification of strand-specific transcripts, we argue that orphan ORFs should still remain candidates for functional ORFs. In support of this model, interstrain intraspecies genome sequence variation is lower across orphan ORFs than in intergenic regions, indicating that orphan ORFs endure functional constraints and resist deleterious mutations. We conclude that ORFs should be evaluated based on multiple levels of evidence and not be removed from <b>ORFeome</b> annotation solely based on low sequence conservation in other species.

To test the accuracy of evolving predictions, we attempted to PCR-amplify from a highly representative worm cDNA library and Gateway-clone ∼ 4200 ORFs missed earlier and for which new predictions are available in WS 100 (May 2003).

The lack of comprehensive <b>ORFeome</b> resources has thus far hampered systematic applications by protein gain-of-function analysis. Gene and ORF coverage with full-length ORF clones thus needs to be extended. In combination with a unique and versatile cloning system, these will provide the tools for genome-wide systematic functional analyses, to achieve a deeper insight into complex biological processes. Results Here we describe the generation of a full-ORF clone resource of human genes applying the Gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen). A pipeline for efficient cloning and sequencing was developed and a sample tracking database was implemented to streamline the clone production process targeting more than 2, 200 different ORFs. In addition, a robust cloning strategy was established, permitting the simultaneous generation of two clone variants that contain a particular ORF with as well as without a stop codon by the implementation of only one additional working step into the cloning procedure. Up to 92 % of the targeted ORFs were successfully amplified by PCR and more than 93 % of the amplicons successfully cloned.

40|$|Functional {{characterization}} {{of the human genome}} requires tools for systematically modulating gene expression in both loss- and gain-of-function experiments. We describe the production of a sequence-confirmed, clonal collection of over 16, 100 human open-reading frames (ORFs) encoded in a versatile Gateway vector system. Utilizing this <b>ORFeome</b> resource, we created...|$|E
40|$|WorfDB (Worm <b>ORFeome</b> DataBase; [URL] {{was created}} to {{integrate}} and disseminate {{the data from the}} cloning of complete set of ∼ 19 000 predicted protein-encoding Open Reading Frames (ORFs) of Caenorhabditis elegans (also referred to as the ‘worm ORFeome’). WorfDB serves as a central data repository enabling the scientific community to search for availability and quality of cloned ORFs. So far, ORF sequence tags (OSTs) obtained for all individual clones have allowed exon structure corrections for ∼ 3400 ORFs originally predicted by the C. elegans sequencing consortium. In addition, we now have OSTs for ∼ 4300 predicted genes for which no ESTs were available. The database contains this OST information along with data pertinent to the cloning process. WorfDB could serve as a model database for other metazoan <b>ORFeome</b> cloning projects...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFunctional {{characterisation}} {{of proteins}} and large-scale, systems-level studies are enabled by extensive sets of cloned open reading frames (ORFs) in an easily-accessible format that enables many different applications. Here we report {{the release of}} the first stage of the Xenopus <b>ORFeome,</b> which contains 8673 ORFs from the Xenopus Gene Collection (XGC) for Xenopus laevis, cloned into a Gateway® donor vector enabling rapid in-frame transfer of the ORFs to expression vectors. This resource represents an estimated 7871 unique genes, approximately 40 % of the non-redundant X. laevis gene complement, and includes 2724 genes where the human ortholog has an association with disease. Transfer into the Gateway system was validated by 5 ′ and 3 ′ end sequencing of the entire collection and protein expression of a set of test clones. In a parallel process, the underlying ORF predictions from the original XGC collection were re-analysed to verify quality and full-length status, identifying those proteins likely to exhibit truncations when translated. These data are integrated into Xenbase, the Xenopus community database, which associates genomic, expression, function and human disease model metadata to each ORF, enabling end-users to search for <b>ORFeome</b> clones with links to commercial distributors of the collection. When coupled with the experimental advantages of Xenopus eggs and embryos, the <b>ORFeome</b> collection represents a valuable resource for functional genomics and disease modelling...|$|E
40|$|Although {{a highly}} {{accurate}} {{sequence of the}} Caenorhabditis elegans genome has been available for 10 years, the exact transcript structures of many of its protein-coding genes remain unsettled. Approximately two-thirds of the <b>ORFeome</b> has been verified reactively by amplifying and cloning computationally predicted transcript models; still a full third of the <b>ORFeome</b> remains experimentally unverified. To fully identify the protein-coding potential of the worm genome including transcripts that may not satisfy existing heuristics for gene prediction, we developed a computational and experimental platform adapting rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) for large-scale structural transcript annotation. We interrogated 2000 unverified protein-coding genes using this platform. We obtained RACE data for approximately two-thirds of the examined transcripts and reconstructed ORF and transcript models for close to 1000 of these. We defined untranslated regions, identified new exons, and redefined previously annotated exons. Our results show {{that as much as}} 20 % of the C. elegans genome may be incorrectly annotated. Many annotation errors could be corrected proactively with our large-scale RACE platform. [Supplemental material is available online a...|$|E
40|$|Proteome-scale {{studies of}} protein {{three-dimensional}} structures should provide valuable information for both investigating basic biology and developing therapeutics. Critical for these endeavors is {{the expression of}} recombinant proteins. We selected Caenorhabditis elegans as our model organism in a structural proteomics initiative {{because of the high}} quality of its genome sequence and the availability of its <b>ORFeome,</b> protein-encoding open reading frames (ORFs), in a flexible recombinational cloning format. We developed a robotic pipeline for recombinant protein expression, applying the Gateway cloning/expression technology and utilizing a stepwise automation strategy on an integrated robotic platform. Using the pipeline, we have carried out heterologous protein expression experiments on 10, 167 ORFs of C. elegans. With one expression vector and one Escherichia coli strain, protein expression was observed for 4854 ORFs, and 1536 were soluble. Bioinformatics analysis of the data indicates that protein hydrophobicity is a key determining factor for an ORF to yield a soluble expression product. This protein expression effort has investigated the largest number of genes in any organism to date. The pipeline described here is applicable to high-throughput expression of recombinant proteins for other species, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, provided that <b>ORFeome</b> resources become available...|$|E
40|$|Transcription factors (TFs) are {{essential}} regulators of gene expression, and mutated TF genes {{have been shown}} to cause numerous human genetic diseases. Yet to date, no single, comprehensive database of human TFs exists. In this work, we describe the collection of an essentially complete set of TF genes from one depiction of the human <b>ORFeome,</b> and the design of a microarray to interrogate their expression. Taking 1468 known TFs from TRANSFAC, InterPro, and FlyBase, we used this seed set to search the ScriptSure human transcriptome database for additional genes. ScriptSure’s genome-anchored transcript clusters allowed us to work with a nonredundant high-quality representation of the human transcriptome. We used a high-stringency similarity search by using BLASTN, and a protein motif search of the human <b>ORFeome</b> by using hidden Markov models of DNA-binding domains known to occur exclusively or primarily in TFs. Four hundred ninety-four additional TF genes were identified in the overlap between the two searches, bringing our estimate {{of the total number of}} human TFs to 1962. Zinc finger genes are by far the most abundant family (762 members), followed by homeobox (199 members) and basic helix-loop-helix genes (117 members). We designed a microarray of 50 -mer oligonucleotide probes targeted to a unique region of the coding sequence of each gene. We have successfully used this microarray to interrogate TF gene expression in species as diverse as chickens and mice, as well as in humans.

40|$|The genome of Caenorhabditis elegans was {{the first}} animal genome to be sequenced. Although {{considerable}} effort {{has been devoted to}} annotating it, the standard WormBase annotation contains thousands of predicted genes {{for which there is no}} cDNA or EST evidence. We hypothesized that a more complete experimental annotation could be obtained by creating a more accurate gene-prediction program and then amplifying and sequencing predicted genes. Our approach was to adapt the TWINSCAN gene prediction system to C. elegans and C. briggsae and to improve its splice site and intron-length models. The resulting system has 60 % sensitivity and 58 % specificity in exact prediction of open reading frames (ORFs), and hence, proteins–the best results we are aware of any multicellular organism. We then attempted to amplify, clone, and sequence 265 TWINSCAN-predicted ORFs that did not overlap WormBase gene annotations. The success rate was 55 %, adding 146 genes that were completely absent from WormBase to the ORF clone collection (<b>ORFeome).</b> The same procedure had a 7 % success rate on 90 Worm Base “predicted” genes that do not overlap TWINSCAN predictions. These results indicate that the accuracy of WormBase could be significantly increased by replacing its partially curated predicted genes with TWINSCAN predictions. The technology described in this study will continue to drive the C. elegans <b>ORFeome</b> toward completion and contribute to the annotation of the three Caenorhabditis species currently being sequenced. The results also suggest that this technology can significantly improve our knowledge of the “parts list” for even the best-studied model organisms...|$|E
