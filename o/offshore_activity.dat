30|$|Based on our {{experiences}} from {{the interaction between}} climate service providers and users two major conclusions can be drawn: (i) Marine areas are often data sparse regions with insufficient data coverage to {{provide the basis for}} reliable statistics often needed for any <b>offshore</b> <b>activity.</b> Met-ocean hindcasts and long-term projections such as provided for example by coastDat are often an appropriate alternative in case observational data are insufficient.

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{studies have been}} searching for evidence on and driving forces for offshoring. Typically, this search has been conducted by analysing gross trade flows related to <b>offshored</b> <b>activities</b> using gravity equations augmented by ad hoc measures of supply-side country differences. This paper suggests that gravity formulations of this sort are potentially mis-specified, due to theoretically unmotivated attempts of allowing for both complete and incomplete specialisation influences on gross trade flows within the same gravity framework. The paper suggests an alternative specification rooted in incomplete specialisation with complete specialisation as a natural limiting case.

40|$|Offshoring can {{be defined}} as the {{relocation}} of organizational tasks and services to foreign locations. Increasingly, firms experience that unforeseen costs and difficulties of managing offshoring undercut anticipated benefits; that unexpected challenges of offshoring jeopardize and eventually undermine initial objectives. Guided by the research question—what are the organizational consequences of offshoring?—the purpose of this thesis is to investigate why some firms fail when offshoring and other do not. The thesis consists of four research papers using various datasets and methodologies that investigate offshoring in an organizational context. The first paper investigates how the complexity of offshoring leads to ‘hidden costs’ of implementing <b>offshoring</b> <b>activities.</b> The second paper looks at how these hidden reconfiguration costs influence the process performance of the <b>offshored</b> <b>activity</b> and how this relationship is moderated by the modularity of that activity. The third paper investigates the effect of the organizational reconfiguration of offshoring on firms’ strategies. The final paper studies different strategies of adaptation in offshoring. Taken together, this thesis argues that whether firms relocate activities with the purpose of accessing resources or as a response to political pressures, the process of offshoring presents firms with the challenge of coordinating and integrating <b>offshoring</b> <b>activities</b> in a global organization. The complexities and uncertainties of an organization consisting of a number of <b>offshored</b> <b>activities</b> (in contrast to an organization with only co-located activities) require firms to invest additional resources in coordination mechanisms so that an efficient reintegration can be achieved...|$|R

For landing north type and <b>offshore</b> <b>activity</b> type, the distribution of setup contours is near parallel to the coastline; for direct landing type, maximum surge obviously occurs at landing point, and setup reduces gradually from the centre to outside. The storm surge in the submerged radial sandbars has a close relation with sea-floor relief and the combination of passing time of typhoon and astronomic tide. It is necessary for storm surge prediction or simulation to consider topography, route and the time going through synthetically...|$|E
40|$|Critics of {{globalization}} claim that US manufacturing firms are being driven to shift employment abroad by {{the prospects of}} cheaper labor. Others argue that the availability of low-wage labor has allowed US-based firms to survive and even prosper. Yet evidence for either hypothesis, beyond anecdotes, is slim. Using firm-level data collected by the US Bureau of Economics Analysis (BEA), we estimate the impact on US manufacturing employment of changes in foreign affiliate wages, controlling for changing demand conditions and technological change. We show that the motive for offshoring and consequently the location of <b>offshore</b> <b>activity</b> significantly affects the impact of offshoring on parent employment. However, for firms which do significantly different tasks at home and abroad, foreign and domestic employment are complements. These offsetting effects may be combined to show that offshoring {{is associated with a}} quantitatively small decline in manufacturing employment.

Individual wells are producing at record levels. Investment is in the billions. With names like Auger, Neptune, Mars, and Thunder Horse, platforms are producing from water depths approaching 3000 m.

The environmental challenges associated with working in deepwater have increased the risk associated with terrorism/security, equipment, onshore infrastructure, oil spill prevention/preparation, pipelines, and response. Even so, the industry and the regulatory agencies have worked carefully through these issues. Superimposed on this environment is the freshwater discharge associated with the Mississippi River. This plume, coupled with hurricanes and coastal erosion issues, adds to the risks associated with hydrocarbon production both on and offshore Louisiana. The policy-making community needs to be aware of these potential risks, as they are real. This paper will address some of these concerns. ...|$|E

40|$|Research Objectives Increasing cost-consciousness in the {{telecommunications}} industry drives network vendors to seek more cost-efficient solutions for delivery. The {{purpose of the study}} is to describe and evaluate how internal <b>offshore</b> <b>activities</b> are managed in the managed services market of {{the telecommunications}} industry and how cost accounting methods support this management. The theoretical part of the research aims to present offshoring as a global strategy and solution to improving business. In the practical part of the study <b>offshore</b> <b>activities</b> and their management, as well as the challenges and benefits that result from it, are examined through business cases of one company and interpretations are made based on the empirical evidence provided by those business cases. Empirical study The empirical study was conducted by using both primary and secondary sources. Primary sources were business case interviews with project managers, while the study was supported with company internal documentation related to business cases or <b>offshoring</b> <b>activities</b> in general. Findings Offshoring continues to be a growing trend. With the help of technology a lot of services can be transferred to global service centers where better utilization of shared resources and a lower cost per head help to reduce the costs of delivery. There are undeniable benefits from offshoring in terms of cost savings and faster service delivery as long as the transfer and maintenance of global operations are managed carefully from beginning to end. The study shows that challenges in offshoring managed services arise more commonly with communication and cultural issues rather than with technical feasibility or implementation and that cost accounting methods related to <b>offshore</b> <b>activities</b> leave room for improvement...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} production offshoring – {{the relocation}} of production activities to locations abroad – of European firms. The analysis employs data from the European Manufacturing Survey (EMS). <b>Offshoring</b> <b>activity</b> is declining across most countries, sectors, and firm sizes between the periods 2004 / 06 and 2007 / 09. Regression analysis reveals that this decline is also significant after controlling for firm characteristics. Long-term data for Germany indicate that this decrease {{is part of a}} longer trend which already started in 2003. Despite the general decrease in offshoring, far-shoring to Asia in general and to China in particular has increased. In contrast, near-shoring to EU member states in Middle and Eastern Europe (EU- 12) became less attractive. The EU- 12, however, is still the most important target region for <b>offshoring</b> <b>activities</b> of European firms. The dominant motive for offshoring is the wish to reduce labour costs. Expected labour cost reductions explain offshoring to the EU- 12, Asia and China in particular. Vicinity to customers and market expansion follow as a motive with a wide margin.
