25|$|For some nuclei, {{the process}} occurs as {{conversion}} of two protons to neutrons, emitting two electron neutrinos and absorbing two orbital electrons (double electron capture). If the mass {{difference between the}} parent and daughter atoms is more than 1.022MeV/c2 (two electron masses), another decay is accessible, capture of one <b>orbital</b> <b>electron</b> and emission of one positron. When the mass difference is more than 2.044MeV/c2 (four electron masses), emission of two positrons is possible. These theoretical decay branches have not been observed.|$|E
25|$|Characteristic X-ray {{emission}} (X-ray fluorescence): If {{the electron}} has enough energy it can knock an <b>orbital</b> <b>electron</b> {{out of the}} inner electron shell of a metal atom, {{and as a result}} electrons from higher energy levels then fill up the vacancy and X-ray photons are emitted. This process produces an emission spectrum of X-rays at a few discrete frequencies, sometimes referred to as the spectral lines. The spectral lines generated depend on the target (anode) element used and thus are called characteristic lines. Usually these are transitions from upper shells into K shell (called K lines), into L shell (called L lines) and so on.|$|E

40|$|Transport {{dimensionality}} of Ti d {{electrons in}} (LaTiO 3) (1) /(SrTiO 3) (N) superlattices {{has been investigated}} using density functional theory with local spin-density approximation + U method. Different spatial distribution patterns have been found between Ti t(2 g) <b>orbital</b> <b>electrons.</b> The d(xy) <b>orbital</b> <b>electrons</b> are highly localized near interfaces due to the potentials by positively charged LaO layers, while the degenerate d(yz) and d(xz) <b>orbital</b> <b>electrons</b> are more distributed inside SrTiO 3 insulators. For N >= 3 unit cells (u. c.), the Ti d(xy) densities of state exhibit the staircaselike increments, which appear at the same energy levels as the d(xy) flat bands along the Gamma-Z direction in band structures. The k(z) -independent discrete energy levels indicate that the electrons in d(xy) flat bands are two-dimensional electron gases (2 DEGs) which can transport along interfaces, but they cannot transport perpendicularly to interfaces due to the confinements in the potential wells by LaO layers. Unlike the d(xy) <b>orbital</b> <b>electrons,</b> the d(yz) and d(xz) <b>orbital</b> <b>electrons</b> have three-dimensional (3 D) transport characteristics, regardless of SrTiO 3 thicknesses. The 2 DEG formation by d(xy) <b>orbital</b> <b>electrons,</b> when N >= 3 u. c., indicates the existence of critical SrTiO 3 thickness where the electron transport dimensionality starts to change from 3 D to 2 D in (LaTiO 3) (1) /(SrTiO 3) (N) superlatticesclose...|$|R

30|$|From the {{molecular}} perspective, the d <b>orbital</b> <b>electrons</b> {{were presented in}} the sulfur atom, so the sulfides were prone to be oxidized selectively to the sulfoxide or sulfone with stronger polarity by peracetic acid.

50|$|There is {{a related}} {{phenomenon}} {{at the level}} of electronic orbitals.
