5|$|Quantitative easing (QE) is the {{practice}} in which a central bank tries to mitigate a potential or actual recession by increasing the money supply for its domestic economy. This {{can be done by}} printing money and injecting it into the domestic economy via <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations.</b> There may be a promise to destroy any newly created money once the economy improves in order to avoid inflation.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the core}} {{economic}} functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad. Consumers, multinational corporations, individual and institutional investors, and financial intermediaries (such as banks) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the European Central Bank or the U.S. Federal Reserve System) undertake <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations</b> {{in their efforts to}} realize monetary policy goals. International financial institutions such as the Bretton Woods institutions, multilateral development banks and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to countries in crisis, provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives. Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, Institute of International Finance, and the World Federation of Exchanges attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications.|$|E
25|$|Under {{inflation}} targeting, <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations</b> {{target a}} specific {{short-term interest rate}} in the debt markets. This target is changed periodically to achieve and maintain an inflation rate within a target range. However, other variants of monetary policy also often target interest rates: the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank use variations on interest rate targets to guide <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> is an {{instrument}} of monetary policy which involves buying or selling of government securities from or {{to the public and}} banks. This mechanism influences the reserve position of the banks, yield on government securities and cost of bank credit. The RBI sells government securities to control the flow of credit and buys government securities to increase credit flow. <b>Open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> makes bank rate policy effective and maintains stability in government securities market.|$|R
30|$|Under some conditions, reserve {{requirements}} are equal to {{a tax on}} deposits combined with an <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation.</b> See Bacchetta and Caminal (1994).|$|R
50|$|But for an <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> {{instrument}} to be effective, {{there has to}} be an active securities market for RBI to make any kind of effect on the liquidity and rates of interest.|$|R

25|$|<b>Open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations</b> are one tool within {{monetary}} policy {{implemented by the}} Federal Reserve to steer short-term interest rates using the power {{to buy and sell}} treasury securities.|$|E
25|$|Under a gold standard, notes {{would be}} {{convertible}} to gold, and so <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations</b> {{could be used}} to keep the value of a fiat currency constant relative to gold.|$|E
40|$|<b>Open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> was {{introduced}} as a monetary policy tool in Nigeria in 1993. Since then, {{it has been}} extensively {{used in conjunction with}} other tools such as reserve requirement, discount window operation, and moral suasion as an instrument of price stability; however, inflation in Nigeria has not reduced to the desired single digit level on a consistent basis. It is against this background that, our paper investigated the impact of OMO as a tool for monetary policy on price stability in Nigeria from 1993 - 2007. Using OLS regression model, our result reveals that <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> has positive non-significant impact on consumer price stability as proxied by inflation rate in Nigeria. Our result also reveals that there was a positive correlation between <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> and consumer price stability of the Central Bank of Nigeria for the period, therefore remains a useful tool, hence our recommendation is that it should be used in conjunction with other relevant ones in the maintenance of price stability in Nigeria...|$|R
5000|$|Strong's {{policy of}} {{maintaining}} price levels during the 1920s through <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> and {{his willingness to}} maintain the liquidity of banks during panics have been praised by monetarists and harshly criticized by Austrian economists ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> {{is also a}} means {{through which}} {{inflation}} can be controlled because when treasury bills are sold to commercial banks these banks can no longer give out loans {{to the public for}} the period and therefore money is being reduced from circulation.|$|R
25|$|The Swiss National Bank {{currently}} targets the 3-month Swiss franc LIBOR rate. The primary way the SNB {{influences the}} 3-month Swiss franc LIBOR rate is through <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations,</b> {{with the most}} important monetary policy instrument being repo transactions.|$|E
25|$|Virtually all {{central banks}} set an {{interest}} rate target, and conduct <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations</b> to ensure base interest rates remain at that target level. According to MMT the issuing of government bonds is best understood as an operation to offset government spending rather than a requirement to finance it.|$|E
25|$|Money {{is created}} or {{destroyed}} {{by changing the}} reserve account of the bank with the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has conducted <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations</b> in this manner since the 1920s, through the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, {{under the direction of}} the Federal Open Market Committee.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{interest}} rate targeting {{there are other}} possible targets of <b>open</b> <b>markets</b> <b>operations.</b> A second possible target is the contraction of the money supply, {{as was the case}} in the U.S. in the late 1970s through the early 1980s under Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.|$|R
40|$|I {{show that}} when a central bank is financially {{independent}} from the treasury and has balance sheet concerns, {{an increase in the}} size or a change in the composition of the central bank's balance sheet (quantitative easing) can serve as a commitment device in a liquidity trap scenario. In particular, when the short-term interest rate is up against the zero lower bound, an <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> by the central bank that involves purchases of long-term bonds can help mitigate the deation and a large negative output gap under a discretionary equilibrium. This is because such an <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> provides an incentive to the central bank to keep interest rates low in future in order to avoid losses in its balance sheet...|$|R
50|$|<b>Open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> is the {{activity}} of buying and selling of government securities in <b>open</b> <b>market</b> to control the supply of money in banking system. When there is excess supply of money, central bank sells government securities thereby sucking out excess liquidity. Similarly, when liquidity is tight, RBI will buy government securities and thereby inject money supply into the economy.|$|R
25|$|This was {{accomplished}} by refusing the exchange of notes for gold and {{it was hoped that}} this would lower domestic prices and raise the exchange rate for the Australian pound. When gold arrived from New York, U.S. the government sold securities in order to diminish the effect of monetary expansion, therefore executing the first <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations</b> in the history of Australia and thus the first attempt of central banking.|$|E
25|$|Since {{central bank}} money {{currently}} exists mainly {{in the form of}} electronic records (electronic money) rather than in the form of paper or coins (physical money), <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations</b> can be conducted by simply increasing or decreasing (crediting or debiting) the amount of electronic money that a bank has in its reserve account at the central bank. This does not require the creation of new physical currency, unless a direct payment bank demands to exchange a part of its electronic money against banknotes or coins.|$|E
25|$|Federal Reserve Notes {{are printed}} by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), a bureau of the Department of the Treasury. When Federal Reserve Banks require {{additional}} notes for circulation, they must post collateral {{in the form}} of direct federal obligations, private bank obligations, or assets purchased through <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations.</b> If the notes are newly printed, they also pay the BEP for the cost of printing (about 4¢ per note). This differs from the issue of coins, which are purchased for their face value.|$|E
50|$|Float {{is used by}} {{commercial}} banks as the overnight investable funds. In order to smooth fluctuations in the aggregate level of bank reserves, Federal Reserve banks use their <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> {{to buy and sell}} Government securities daily. Countries can restrict or expand the amount of float available to trade a currency.|$|R
50|$|The main {{monetary}} policy instruments available to central banks are <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation,</b> bank reserve requirement, interest rate policy, re-lending and re-discount (including {{using the term}} repurchase market), and credit policy (often coordinated with trade policy). While capital adequacy is important, it is defined and regulated by the Bank for International Settlements, and central banks in practice generally do not apply stricter rules.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the effects and desirability of paying interest on required reserves. Scott Freeman and Joseph Haslag demonstrate that a policy of paying interest on reserves can make everyone better off, even if the interest must be financed by a tax on capital. An essential part of this policy is an <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> that offsets any changes {{in the value of}} money. Bank reserves...|$|R
25|$|A {{central bank}} {{can also use}} a mixture of policy {{settings}} that change depending on circumstances. A central bank may peg its exchange rate (like a currency board) with different levels or forms of commitment. The looser the exchange rate peg, the more latitude the central bank has to target other variables (such as interest rates). It may instead target a basket of foreign currencies rather than a single currency. In some instances it is empowered to use additional means other than <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations,</b> such as changes in reserve requirements or capital controls, to achieve monetary outcomes.|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} {{reserve ratio}} is sometimes {{used as a}} tool in monetary policy, influencing the country's borrowing and interest rates by changing the amount of funds available for banks to make loans with. Western central banks rarely increase the reserve requirements because it would cause immediate liquidity problems for banks with low excess reserves; they generally prefer to use <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations</b> (buying and selling government-issued bonds) to implement their monetary policy. The People's Bank of China uses changes in reserve requirements as an inflation-fighting tool, and raised the reserve requirement ten times in 2007 and eleven times {{since the beginning of}} 2010.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Reserve System {{implements}} {{monetary policy}} largely by targeting {{the federal funds}} rate. This is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed. This rate is actually determined by the market and is not explicitly mandated by the Fed. The Fed therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate by adding or subtracting from the money supply through <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations.</b> The Federal Reserve System usually adjusts the federal funds rate target by 0.25% or 0.50% at a time.|$|E

40|$|Could the Federal Reserve have {{reversed}} {{the decline in}} the money supply during the Great Depression without causing a loss of confidence in the U. S. commitment to the gold standard? This article uses the $ 1 billion expansionary <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> in 1932 as a crucial case study. Using forward exchange rates and interest rate differentials to measure devaluation expectations, we find virtually no evidence that the large monetary expansion led investors to believe that the United States would devalue. The financial press and Federal Reserve records also show scant evidence of expectations of devaluation or fear of speculative attack. ...|$|R
40|$|Using a macro-econometric {{model that}} is {{specified}} {{for the current}} Chinese economy, we investigate the performance of monetary policy in China with the assumption (which anyway will occur in the near future) that capital <b>market</b> was <b>opened.</b> Our purpose is to find how the monetary authority should response {{to a variety of}} external shocks by applying different policy tools (including required reserve ratio, buying and selling foreign exchange, the <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation,</b> the discount rate among others) while keeping the exchange rate within a designed regime. The Monte Carlo simulation will be used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} such policy reactions. ...|$|R
25|$|In {{engineering}} and economics, many problems involve multiple objectives {{which are not}} describable as the-more-the-better or the-less-the-better; instead, there is an ideal target value for each objective, and the desire is to get {{as close as possible}} to the desired value of each objective. For example, energy systems typically have a trade-off between performance and cost or one might want to adjust a rocket's fuel usage and orientation so that it arrives both at a specified place and at a specified time; or one might want to conduct <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations</b> so that both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate are {{as close as possible to}} their desired values.|$|E
25|$|In {{economics}} and especially macroeconomics, {{the effects of}} proposed policy actions, such as fiscal policy changes or monetary policy changes, are simulated to judge their desirability. A mathematical model of the economy, having been fitted to historical economic data, {{is used as a}} proxy for the actual economy; proposed values of government spending, taxation, <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations,</b> etc. are used as inputs to the simulation of the model, and various variables of interest such as the inflation rate, the unemployment rate, the balance of trade deficit, the government budget deficit, etc. are the outputs of the simulation. The simulated values of these variables of interest are compared for different proposed policy inputs to determine which set of outcomes is most desirable.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1960s, {{monetary}} authorities accepted Coombs' conclusions and allowed a flexible interest rate, {{making it easier}} for the bank to rely on <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operations.</b> The Exchange Control was abolished after the float of the Australian dollar occurred in 1983. In the five years after the Campbell Committee probe, 1979–1984, the financial system in Australia became deregulated. Another probe was the Wallis Committee in 1996, which took effect in 1998. The effects were the transfer of overseeing the banks from the RBA to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and the creation of the Payments System Board (PSB), which would attempt to maintain the safety and performance of the payments system. The bank was given powers within the PSB through additional legislation in 1998.|$|E
40|$|An {{exogenous}} {{increase in}} the money supply is typically followed by a temporary fall in nominal interest rates. Flexible price macroeconomic models argue that this liquidity effect arises because asset markets are segmented. That is, {{only a fraction of}} the agents are present in the bond market when the central bank conducts an <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation.</b> However, to be quantitatively successful, segmented markets models assume frictions that are too large to be interpreted literally in terms of constraints faced by realworld firms and households. An important open question is: can a complicated array of microeconomic frictions imply one large aggregate friction of this kind? Keyword...|$|R
40|$|In {{a classic}} paper, "The Lag in Effect of Monetary Policy," Friedman (1961) {{describes}} an expansionary <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> as diffusing across the economy, pulling {{the price in}} one market {{out of line with}} the price in the next market as it spreads. The objective {{of this paper is to}} build a model where this process is made explicit, specifically, where money affects real economic activity by altering relative prices of goods as it spills from one market into the next. Thus the paper superimposes a monetary overlapping generations model on a simple abstract spatial structure [...] specifically, a graph [...] and then studies the effect of an expansionary monetary policy.

40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the monetary policy variable linkages with Indonesia's balance of payments. Using svar and IRF analysis found {{that the level of}} α = 0. 05, variable monetary policy instruments such as <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>operation</b> (OPT), the minimum reserve requirement (GWM), and the discount rate (rDisk) has a significant relationship with the variable balance of payments (BOP). In fact, all the macroeconomic variables also significantly affect the balance of payments variables, except the variable domestic interest rates. This means that there is a close link between monetary policy instruments with the balance of payments in Indonesia in the period of the study. _________________________________ Keywords: Instruments of Monetary policy, Balance of payment, SVAR, IR...|$|R
