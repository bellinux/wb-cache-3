BackgroundConflicting results exist {{on the outcome of}} <b>off-hours</b> pPCI. MethodsWe analyzed in-hospital and 1 -year cardiac mortality among 3, 072 consecutive ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated with pPCI between January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2006, during regular-hours (weekdays 8 : 00 am to 8 : 00 pm) and <b>off-hours</b> (weekdays 8 : 01 pm to 7 : 59 am, weekends, and holidays) within the STEMI Network of the Italian Region Emilia-Romagna (28 hospitals: 19 spoke and 9 hub interventional centers). ResultsFifty-three percent of patients were treated <b>off-hours.</b> Baseline findings were comparable, although regular-hours patients were older and had more incidences of multivessel disease. Median pain-to-balloon (195 min, interquartile range [IQR]: 140 to 285 vs. 186 min, IQR: 130 to 280 min; p = 0. 03) and door-to-balloon time (88 min, IQR: 60 to 122 vs. 77 min, IQR: 48 to 116 min; p < 0. 0001) were longer for <b>off-hours</b> pPCI. However, unadjusted in-hospital (5. 8 % <b>off-hours</b> vs. 7. 2 % regular-hours, p = 0. 11) and 1 -year cardiac mortality (8. 4 % <b>off-hours</b> vs. 10. 3 % regular-hours, p = 0. 08) were comparable. At multivariate analysis, <b>off-hours</b> pPCI did not predict an adverse outcome either for the overall population (odds ratio [OR]: 0. 70, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 49 to 1. 01) or for patients directly admitted to the interventional center (OR: 0. 79, 95 % CI: 0. 52 to 1. 20).

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether poorer outcomes in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) during <b>off-hours</b> are related to delays in treatment, circadian changes in biology, or differences in operator-related quality of care. BackgroundPrevious investigation has suggested that patients undergoing primary PCI during <b>off-hours</b> {{are more likely to}} have adverse cardiac events than routine-hours patients, but the reasons for this remain poorly defined. MethodsClinical, angiographic, and procedural characteristics were compared in consecutive patients (n = 685) undergoing primary PCI in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Dynamic Registry between 1997 and 2006 that were classified as occurring during routine-hours (07 : 00 to 18 : 59) or <b>off-hours</b> (19 : 00 to 06 : 59). The primary end points were in-hospital death, MI, and target vessel revascularization. ResultsMedian time from symptom onset to PCI was similar (<b>off-hours</b> 3. 4 h vs. routine-hours 3. 3 h). Patients presenting in <b>off-hours</b> were more likely to present with cardiogenic shock and multivessel coronary artery disease but were equally likely to present with complete occlusion of the infarct-related artery. Procedural complications including dissection were more frequent in <b>off-hours</b> patients. In-hospital death, MI, and target vessel revascularization were significantly higher in <b>off-hours</b> patients (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2. 66, p = 0. 001), and differences in outcomes were worse even if the procedure was immediately successful (adjusted OR: 2. 58, p = 0. 005, adjusting for angiographic success). Patients undergoing PCI on weekends had better outcomes during the daytime than nighttime. ConclusionsPatients undergoing primary PCI for acute MI during <b>off-hours</b> are at significantly higher risk for in-hospital death, MI, and target vessel revascularization. These findings appear related to both diurnal differences in presentation and lesion characteristics, as well as differences in procedural complication and success rates that extend beyond differences in symptom-to-balloon time...|$|R

Standardized mortality rates (SMRs) of patients admitted during <b>off-hours</b> were compared to SMRs of patients admitted during office hours using Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM 1) and Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM 2) scores. Office hours were defined as week days between 8 : 00 a. m. and 6 : 00 p. m., with in-house attendance of senior staff, and <b>off-hours</b> as week days between 6 : 00 p. m. and 8 : 00 a. m., Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays, with one resident covering the PICU and senior staff directly available on-call.

40|$|The {{association}} between <b>off-hours</b> presentation and mortality {{in patients with}} ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis {{to assess the impact}} of <b>off-hours</b> presentation on short- and long-term mortality among STEMI patients.

A total of 30 studies with 33 cohorts involving 192, 658 STEMI patients were included. <b>Off-hours</b> presentation was associated with short-term mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1. 07, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 02 - 1. 12, P = 0. 004) but not with long-term mortality (OR 1. 00, 95 % CI 0. 94 - 1. 07, P = 0. 979).

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the outcomes of patients undergoing on- and <b>off-hours</b> primary percutaneous coronary interventions performed at a reference cardiology center. MethodsProspective cohort study, including 1, 108 consecutive patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction divided into a group of primary percutaneous coronary intervention performed during regular working hours (on-hours: 8 : 00 am to 8 : 00 pm) and primary percutaneous coronary intervention during non-regular working hours group (off-hours: 8 : 00 pm to 8 : 00 am). ResultsThe sample included 680 patients in the on-hours group and 428 in the <b>off-hours</b> group. Baseline demographic data, risk factors and Killip classification were similar in both groups; however door-to-balloon time was significantly longer in the <b>off-hours</b> group (84 ± 66 minutes vs. 102 ± 98 minutes; p < 0. 01). Culprit vessels and pre- and post-procedure TIMI flows were not different between groups. There were no significant differences for in-hospital mortality (7. 6 % vs. 10. 2 %; p = 0. 16), stent thrombosis (2. 8 % vs. 2. 4 %; p = 0. 69) or major bleeding (1. 9 % vs. 2. 1 %; p = 0. 50).

MethodsWe studied 736 consecutive STEMI patients transferred for primary percutaneous intervention (PCI) to a single large volume urban Primary PCI center. Characteristics and clinical outcome of patients admitted during ON-hours (Monday through Friday 8 am- 6 pm) were compared to <b>OFF-hours</b> patients (admitted during night shifts and weekends). Clinical outcome was 1 year death and death or MI. ResultsSTEMI patients undergoing primary PCI were admitted more frequently during <b>OFF-hours</b> (n = 449; 61. 1 %) than ON-hours (n = 287; 38. 9 %), with no major differences in characteristics or treatment between the two groups. Use of radial approach and the rate of stenting during PCI was 83. 3 % and 86. 1 % in ON-hours patients vs. 88. 2 %. and 88. 1 % in <b>OFF-hours</b> patients. There was no impact of time of admission on in-hospital mortality before or after adjustment for baseline characteristics OR 1. 54; CI [0. 71 – 3. 35]. Time from symptom onset to first medical contact was shorter during <b>OFF-hours</b> than ON-hours (105 min [50 – 225] vs. 114 min [60 – 367]; p = 0. 06). Time from first medical contact to sheath insertion was also identical between the 2 groups (101 min [80 – 155] and 105 min [78 – 155]; p = 0. 61 respectively). Time to TIMI 3 flow and duration of procedure were also similar.
