Then, when she had paid off till the wind was abeam, by reversing the wheel hard across to the opposite hard-over I could take advantage of her momentum away from the wind and work her off squarely before it. This made all the wood-floated triangles of bird-snares tow aft along her sides.|$|E
50|$|Actually {{obtaining the}} Act had cost the Company dear in Parliamentary expenses, but it {{instructed}} Watson, Smith and Watson {{to proceed with}} construction; it appears that little supervision of the contractor was exercised, however. Moreover, the GWR continued its <b>obstructive</b> <b>tactics,</b> now {{in connection with the}} bridge for the S&CER to cross the GWR main line at Rushey Platt.|$|E
50|$|The {{project is}} facing the <b>obstructive</b> <b>tactics</b> of current federal {{government}} in the Central Development Working Party, a government department tasked with approving projects whose cost is less than Rs3bn. Members of the CDWP, which {{is run by the}} PML-N federal government, say the project cost is too high, and that the cost of the electricity it will generate is also too high for a hydel project. It is hard to avoid the impression that the resistance to this project is political rather than financial. If they are serious about comparing the project costs of Gorkin Matiltan with that of Duber Khwar HPP, they should also note that the latter was begun more than a decade ago.|$|E
2500|$|A {{filibuster}} in the United States Senate is a dilatory or <b>obstructive</b> <b>tactic</b> {{used in the}} United States Senate {{to prevent}} a measure from being brought to a vote. The {{most common form of}} filibuster occurs when one or more senators attempts to delay or block a vote on a bill by extending debate on the measure. The Senate rules permit a senator, or a series of senators, to speak {{for as long as they}} wish, and on any topic they choose, unless [...] "three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn" [...] (usually 60 out of 100) bring the debate to a close by invoking cloture under Senate Rule XXII.|$|R
50|$|The LSWR were {{therefore}} alarmed at this development, {{as it would}} bring broad gauge trains into Southampton docks, the heart of territory the LSWR considered its own, and immediately promoted a rival scheme to reach Wimborne and Dorchester from Salisbury, which it had not yet reached. Opinion in local communities largely favoured the Southampton and Dorchester proposals, seeing the LSWR for the <b>obstructive</b> <b>tactic</b> that it was, and welcoming the competition that GWR alliance would bring to an area dominated by the GWR. Moreover, Weymouth would get its connection, through the broad gauge Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway now being promoted; and some favoured a coastal line for its usefulness in defensive troop movements {{in the event of}} an attack by France. The major disadvantage was that there would be a break of gauge at Southampton for passengers and goods travelling between Dorset and London.|$|R
40|$|Following the {{partition}} of Sudan in July 2011, {{the breakdown of the}} CPA process on transitional governance has led the Nuba Mountain Region to a state of crisis, stemming from fragmented tribes with ethno-political allegiances to President al-Bashir’s National Congress Party (NCP), or the Nuba-backed SPLM-N. Furthermore, GoS initiated aerial bombardments combined with sweeping ground attacks by SAF forces against the SPLM-N and supporters has created a regional humanitarian crisis, with more than 150, 000 IDPs fleeing to South Sudan and Ethiopia. In the face of an emerging alliance between Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) opposition and insurgent groups with the intention of regime change, the al-Bashir regime has denied the entry of aid organizations and international observers to the region, and has continued military incursions and attacks on South Sudan and autonomous regions in its plight to control disputed oil-rich territory. These are clear violations of UNSC resolution 2046 and undermine AU-mediated negotiations pushing a 3 -month timeline for negotiations between the GoS and the GoSS to resolve disputed border areas, install a Safe Demilitarized Border Zone with an agreement on border demarcation, oil revenue sharing, and a resolution to the administration of the Abyei territory. Policy recommendations that prioritize an end to violence in South Kordofan, Blue Nile and Abyei regions, oil transit fee settlements, and alleviating the humanitarian crisis are addressed tos the internatonal community and the Government of Canada. These recommendations also address the <b>obstructive</b> and pre-emptive <b>tactics</b> by the al-Bashir regime to avoid a recurrent civil war fueled by the insurgency of the SRF amidst an emerging political crisis in Khartoum...|$|R
5000|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (October 19, 1947) — Archie Goodwin, Nero Wolfe's {{right-hand}} man, {{takes an}} assumed name {{and enters the}} employ of the engineering firm of Naylor-Kerr, Inc., in order to investigate {{the death of a}} former employee of that firm. In no time at all everybody in the Naylor-Kerr organization knows who Archie is and what he is doing. Naturally that makes it a bit difficult for him to carry on. Another difficulty is {{that there are so many}} liars about the place. Nero Wolfe advises Archie to counter-attack by capping their lies with others of his own, which Archie does with excellent results. Most of the women in the case — and mighty attractive women they are — are employees of Naylor-Kerr, and one of them is even more closely connected with the firm. Nero and Archie win out despite the <b>obstructive</b> <b>tactics</b> of almost everyone concerned. But why does Rex Stout call these books Nero Wolfe novels? Surely Archie Goodwin deserves equal billing with his obese employer.|$|E
