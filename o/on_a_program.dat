As with the earlier Fuji-class battleships, Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships, and turned again to the United Kingdom. They were ordered {{as part of the}} Ten Year Naval Expansion Programme and paid for from the £30,000,000 indemnity paid by China after losing the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{experience}} in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships, and Japan embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations. In particular, Japan promulgated a ten-year naval build-up programme, {{with the construction of}} six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core. These ships were paid for from the £30,000,000 indemnity paid by China after losing the First Sino-Japanese War.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich was {{appointed}} viceroy of Russian Poland {{by his brother}} and moved to Warsaw {{with his wife and}} children. The stay in Poland proved difficult for the Grand Duke, who was the victim of a nationalist assassination attempt the day after his arrival in the Polish capital. Although Constantine embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> of liberalization and re-instated Polish as an official language, Polish nationalists agitating for reform were not appeased. Finally, an uprising in January 1863 and the radicalization of the separatists pushed the Tsar to recall his brother in August. Olga's difficult experiences in Poland marked her profoundly.|$|E

5|$|To {{accommodate}} {{the rapid growth}} in bus travel, Greyhound also built many new stations in the period between 1937 and 1945, {{most of them in}} a late Art Deco style known as Streamline Moderne. In 1937, Greyhound embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> of unifying its brand identity by acquiring both buses and terminals in the Streamline style. By the outbreak of World War II, the company had 4,750 stations and nearly 10,000 employees.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 1943 Germany's armored forces had {{sustained}} heavy casualties. It was unusual for a Panzer Division to field more than 100 tanks, and most averaged only 70–80 serviceable tanks at any given time. After the fighting around Kharkov, Heinz Guderian embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> to bring Germany's mechanized forces up to strength. Despite his efforts, a German panzer division could only count on an estimated 10,000–11,000 personnel, out of an authorized strength of 13,000–17,000. Only by June did a panzer division begin to field between 100–130 tanks each. SS divisions were normally in better shape, with an estimated 150 tanks, a battalion of self-propelled assault guns and enough half-tracks to motorize most of its infantry and reconnaissance soldiers—and these had an authorized strength of an estimated 19,000 personnel. At this time, the bulk of Germany's armor was still composed of Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs, although the 2nd SS Panzer Division had been outfitted {{with a number of}} Tiger I tanks.|$|E

5|$|Jim Henson {{originally}} {{conceived of}} his Muppets as characters aimed at an adult audience. He {{was disappointed that}} {{the popularity of the}} characters that appeared in Sesame Street, including Big Bird and Bert and Ernie, had solidified a public perception his Muppets were solely intended for educating children. Henson worried he would be stuck forever working on children's television series. He felt his Muppet characters should be able to be appreciated by individuals of any maturity level. Henson told The Saturday Evening Post he had constantly dealt with others looking down upon the idea of puppet performers. He envied ventriloquist Edgar Bergen for his ability to appeal to a mature audience. Henson said he wanted to work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> that was broadcast during the peak adult-viewing time and said he had prior difficulty persuading the major television networks to create a puppet program for mature audiences.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 1956, Sydney met Melbourne off Kangaroo Island {{during the}} latter's {{delivery}} voyage. The two carriers sailed {{together for the}} remainder of Melbournes delivery voyage, visiting Melbourne and Jervis Bay before arriving in Sydney on 10 May. Three days later, the flagship role was transferred from Sydney to Melbourne. After this, Sydney continued <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> of training cruises throughout Australian and New Zealand waters, and visited the Far East Strategic Reserve to participate in a South East Asia Treaty Organisation multi-fleet exercise during September and October 1956. Following an appraisal process by the RAN, during which Sydneys potential usefulness as a commando carrier, aircraft transport, or troopship was considered, the ship was paid off into Special Reserve on 30 May 1958 as surplus to requirements. Sydney could be reactivated for use as a transport, but required at least four months notice.|$|E
5|$|Though the Baltimore Opera Company can {{be traced}} back to the 1924 {{founding}} of the Martinet Opera School, the direct antecedent of the Company was founded in 1950, with Rosa Ponselle, a well-known soprano, as artistic director. In the following decade the Company modernized, receiving new funding from, among other sources, the Ford Foundation, which led to professionalization and the hiring of a full-time production manager and the stabilization <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> consisting of three operas every season; this schedule has since been expanded to four performances. In 1976, the Company commissioned Inês de Castro for the American Bicentennial, composed by Thomas Pasatieri with a libretto by Bernard Stambler; the opera's debut was a great success and an historic moment for American opera.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the battle, Linois used overland messengers to request {{the assistance of}} the Spanish fleet at Cadiz under Admiral Jose de Mazzaredo. Linois and Saumarez also embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> of refitting and repairing their damaged squadrons in preparation for a resumption of the action. At Gibraltar, the wounded were transferred to the naval hospital and the dead buried in the gravesite later to be known as Trafalgar Cemetery. Saumarez ordered that the most damaged of the surviving ships, Pompée and Caesar, be laid up in dock and their crews distributed among the remaining ships to ensure that they could be repaired as rapidly as possible, a situation made necessary in part due to the seizure of many of Gibraltar's shipwrights in the Bay of Gibraltar when they were sent to aid Hannibal in the last stages of the battle. The entire squadron needed extensive repairs, their requirements met by Captain Alexander Ball, naval commissioner at Gibraltar. Captain Jahleel Brenton of Caesar protested this order and Saumarez permitted him to continue with repairs: Caesars crew worked all day and in regular shifts throughout the night for the next week to ensure that when Saumarez sailed again, Caesar sailed with him, the crew having replaced the ship's damaged masts in just four days. Saumarez also sent a boat under a flag of truce in to Algeciras to arrange for the repatriation under parole of Ferris and his officers. Following a brief correspondence between Linois and the British admiral, the captured British officers, including Ferris and Cochrane, were sent to Gibraltar, later joined by the wounded British sailors captured on Hannibal. Ferris was immediately sent to Britain on HMS Plymouth with despatches, to await the court-martial for the loss of his ship. He and his officers were completely exonerated.|$|E
