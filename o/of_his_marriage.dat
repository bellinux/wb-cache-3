5|$|Based on Henry VIII's {{desire for}} an {{annulment}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage</b> (first requested of Pope Clement VII in 1527), the English Reformation {{was at the}} outset more of a political affair than a theological dispute. The reality of political differences between Rome and England allowed growing theological disputes {{to come to the}} fore.|$|E
5|$|By 1869 Calcraft's mother, Sarah, {{was living}} as a pauper in a workhouse at Hatfield Peverel near Chelmsford. Calcraft was ordered to pay 3shillings a week towards her upkeep, to which he objected, arguing that his brother and sister {{should be made to}} help, and that he had three {{children}} of his own to support, although there is no record <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage.</b>|$|E

5|$|The failure <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage</b> and the defeats of the Holy League diminished Sigismund's self-confidence. He {{sent his}} envoys to RudolphII and again offered to abdicate in September 1597. An {{agreement}} regarding his abdication was signed on 23December 1597. RudolphII granted Sigismund the Silesian duchies of Racibórz and Opole and a yearly subsidy of 50,000 thalers. The agreement was kept secret for months.|$|E
5|$|With {{the closing}} of The Royal Hunt of the Sun, and the failing <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage,</b> Carradine left New York {{and headed back to}} California. He {{returned}} to TV to star in the short-lived series Shane, a 1966 western based upon a 1949 novel of the same name and previously filmed in 1953.|$|E
5|$|Around 1848—the exact date <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage</b> is not recorded—Rainilaiarivony, then around 20 or 21 {{years old}} and having adopted the name Radilifera, {{concluded}} a marriage with his paternal cousin Rasoanalina. She bore him sixteen children {{over the course of}} their marriage. In addition, a one-year-old son that Rasoanalina had conceived with another man prior to the union, Ratsimatahodriaka (Radriaka), was adopted by Rainilaiarivony as his own. As a young man, Ratsimatahodriaka was groomed by Rainilaiarivony to become his successor, but the youth fell from a balcony while intoxicated and died in his early twenties.|$|E

5|$|He continued, {{describing}} the unhappiness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage,</b> {{and how that}} made him vulnerable to her attributes, which were shared by all the learned gentlemen of his circle. He also believed that Anna Seward had noticed the effect her friend was having on him, and would regularly place her actions in the best light for his benefit. The elimination of Day as a suitor for Honora Sneyd's hand placed Edgeworth in a difficult situation and he resolved to end it by moving to Lyons France, to work, {{in the autumn of}} 1771.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{following}} the breakdown <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage,</b> Afroyim {{decided to return}} to the United States, but the State Department refused to renew his U.S. passport, ruling that because Afroyim had voted in the 1951 Israeli legislative election, he had lost his citizenship under the provisions of the Nationality Act of 1940. A letter certifying Afroyim's loss of citizenship was issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) on January 13, 1961.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, 1750, Mason married Ann Eibeck, {{only child}} of William and Sarah Eibeck of Charles County, Maryland. The Masons and Eibecks had {{adjacent}} lands in Maryland, and had joined together in real estate transactions; by his death in 1764, William Eilbeck {{was one of the}} wealthiest men in Charles County. At the time <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage,</b> Mason was living at Dogue's Neck, though in which residence is uncertain. George and Ann Mason would have nine children who survived to adulthood. Ann Mason died in 1773; their marriage, judging by surviving accounts, was a happy one.|$|E
50|$|He {{remarried}} on 23 July 1949 Marlene Hoffmann, born at Gross Roppershausen (now Großropperhausen) on 10 July 1913. He had no {{issue by}} either <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriages.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} January Rogers married Sarah Whetstone, {{daughter of}} Rear Admiral Sir William Whetstone, {{who was a}} neighbour and close family friend. Rogers became a freeman of Bristol because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage</b> into the prominent Whetstone family. In 1706, Captain Rogers died at sea, leaving his ships and business to his son Woodes. Between 1706 {{and the end of}} 1708, Woodes and Sarah Rogers had a son and two daughters.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, William Gibbs and {{his wife}} Matilda Blanche Crawley-Boevey (known as Blanche), principally lived in London, for the greater part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage</b> at 16 Hyde Park Gardens, which the family owned until Blanche's death. But as he {{travelled}} regularly on business to the Port of Bristol he required a residence in the area; thus it was, in 1843, he came to buy Tyntes Place, which he subsequently renamed Tyntesfield. Within {{a few years of}} making his purchase, Gibbs began a major program of rebuilding and enlarging of the mansion.|$|E
5|$|A luxurious ball {{followed}} the wedding on 20 May. Louis Stanislas found his wife repulsive; she was considered ugly, tedious, and {{ignorant of the}} customs of the court of Versailles. The marriage remained unconsummated for years. Biographers disagree about the reason. The most common theories propose Louis Stanislas' alleged impotence (according to biographer Antonia Fraser) or his unwillingness to sleep with his wife due to her poor personal hygiene. She never brushed her teeth, plucked her eyebrows, or used any perfumes. At the time <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage,</b> Louis Stanislas was obese and waddled instead of walked. He never exercised and continued to eat enormous amounts of food.|$|E

5|$|As a youth, John de la Pole married twice; {{his first}} {{marriage}} was annulled, but his second marriage, to Elizabeth of York, made him the brother-in-law of two kings, Edward IV and Richard III. It brought him eleven children, the eldest of whom, John, would eventually be named heir to Richard III in 1484 and die in battle in the Yorkist cause. John de la Pole, though, generally managed {{to steer clear of}} involvement in the tumultuous events of the Wars of the Roses. Although he was politically aligned to the House of York, by virtue <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage,</b> he avoided participating in the battles of the 1450s, not taking up arms until Edward IV had claimed the throne. De la Pole appears to have spent much of this period, in fact, feuding with his East Anglian neighbours, the Paston family over an inheritance—even interfering in parliamentary elections, for example, in attempt to gain the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|Dimitri Marick first {{appears in}} Pine Valley in 1991 when he rescues Natalie Marlowe {{from the well}} her twin sister, Janet Green, trapped her in on the Wildwind estate.

His housekeeper, Helga, warns him not to get {{involved}} with her because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage</b> to her comatose daughter, Angelique. He lies to Natalie that his wife died years ago. Once Natalie recovers and everyone learns what happened to her at Janet's hand, Natalie's fiance, Trevor Dillon, tries to reconcile with her. She rejects him because Janet fooled him so easily. Dimitri and Natalie become engaged. Unbeknown to Dimitri, Angelique awakens from her coma. Helga reveals Angelique is out of her coma by bringing her to Wildwind during Dimitri and Natalie's engagement party. Natalie leaves Dimitri and reunites with Trevor. Dimitri reconciles with his wife.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Chad meets {{and falls}} in love with Whitney Russell. Their {{relationship}} is complicated by her sister Simone Russell's crush on him, and her parent's disapproval of him. Eve discourages both of her children from pursuing a relationship with Chad, fearing he will be a bad influence on her daughter in the same way Julian was on her teenage self. Whitney and Chad keep their romantic and sexual encounters secret for years while he pretends to be in love with Simone. The love triangle continues until Simone catches Whitney kissing Chad. Simone breaks up publicly with Chad and tells everyone in Harmony about his relationship with Whitney. During 2003, Chad's connection to Whitney steadily unravels after the discovery <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage</b> to Latoya and her attempt to murder Whitney.|$|E
50|$|In 1960 {{he married}} Mary Lou Dobbs, his {{companion}} {{for the rest}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life. Before her, Montauk had been married to Louise Keene. Montauk had two daughters, Susan and Juliette, one from each <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriages.</b>|$|R

Gregory's fourth marriage, to Ida Mae Galliher, {{ended in divorce}} in 1995 after three years, though they {{continued}} to live together and remarried in 1997.|$|R
5|$|Henry is {{generally}} credited with initiating the English Reformation – {{the process of}} transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one – though his progress at the elite and mass levels is disputed, and the precise narrative not widely agreed. Certainly, in 1527, Henry, until then an observant and well-informed Catholic, appealed to the Pope for an annulment <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage</b> to Catherine. No annulment was immediately forthcoming, the result in part of Charles V's control of the Papacy. The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henry's rejection of papal supremacy (which he had previously defended), though as historian A. F. Pollard has argued, even if Henry had not needed an annulment, Henry may have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons.|$|E
5|$|In 1517, Martin Luther, an Augustinian friar in Germany, {{sent his}} Ninety-Five Theses to several bishops. His theses protested key points of Catholic {{doctrine}} {{as well as}} the sale of indulgences. In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin and other Protestant Reformers further criticised Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into the European movement called the Protestant Reformation, which gave birth to a variety of Christian denominations known today collectively as Protestantism. The English Reformation during the reign of Henry VIII began as a political dispute. When the pope denied Henry's petition for a declaration of nullity <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage</b> to Catherine of Aragon, he had the Acts of Supremacy passed, making him head of Church of England, forming Protestant Anglicanism.|$|E
5|$|In June 1315, Glarentza was {{captured}} by the Aragonese troops of the infante Ferdinand of Majorca, who claimed the princely title of Achaea for himself by virtue <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriage</b> to Isabella of Sabran, granddaughter of William II of Villehardouin. Ferdinand made Glarentza his residence, and soon seized all of Elis, aided by the defection of several Achaean barons dissatisfied with the Principality's rule by the Angevins of Naples. Ferdinand began minting coins with his name—the rarest issues of the Glarentza mint—but his reign was cut short {{with the arrival of}} the legitimate claimants, Matilda of Hainaut and Louis of Burgundy. In the Battle of Manolada, fought to the northeast of Glarentza on 5 July 1316, the Aragonese were defeated and Ferdinand was killed. The remainder of his army fled to Glarentza, and soon handed over the town and the other fortresses they had occupied and departed the Peloponnese, taking the corpse of Ferdinand with them.|$|E
50|$|Prince Michael Andreevich (1920-2008) m. 1 1953 Jill Murphy (b. 1921); they {{divorced}} in 1953. m. 2 1954 Shirley Cramond (1916-1983).m. 3 1993 Giulia Crespi (b. 1930). Michael {{had no children}} from any <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriages.</b>|$|R
50|$|Without {{offspring}} {{with any}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriages,</b> in <b>his</b> will Bolesław I bequeathed all his possessions to {{his younger brother}} Siemowit I. This however annoyed Casimir I, and soon the war continued between the surviving brothers.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>marriages</b> and {{relationships}} {{there were a}} number of candidates contending for the titles of Clanricarde and Earl. The eventual successor was Ulick's eldest legitimate son, Richard Sassanach Burke, 2nd Earl of Clanricarde.|$|R
