60|$|MORE. My friend {{there in}} khaki led that hooting. I've {{never said a}} word against our soldiers. It's the Government I condemn for putting them to this, and the Press for hounding on the Government, and all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> led by the nose to do what none of you would do, left to yourselves.|$|E

I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved." ...|$|E

You must change your style of living--nay," [...] observing a pang to pass across his countenance, [...] "don't let that afflict you. I am sure you have never placed your happiness in outward show--you have yet friends, warm friends, who will not think the worse <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> less splendidly lodged: and surely it does not require a palace to be happy with Mary--" ...|$|E

60|$|His {{dear old}} head was bent {{down over his}} prayer-book--there was no mistaking him. He wore the black gown of the {{pensioners}} of the Hospital of Grey Friars. His order of the Bath was on his breast. He stood there amongst the poor brethren, uttering {{the responses to the}} psalm. The steps of this good man had been ordered him hither by Heaven's decree: to this almshouse! Here it was ordained that a life all love, and kindness, and honour, should end! I heard no more of prayers, and psalms, and sermon, after that. How dared I to be in a place of mark, and he, he yonder among the poor? Oh, pardon, you noble soul! I ask forgiveness <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> of a world that has so treated you--you my better, you the honest, and gentle, and good! I thought the service would never end, or the organist's voluntaries, or the preacher's homily.|$|E

I have tried, oh! how hard I have tried, to believe that you would be better some day, but I can't hope so any longer. You have promised again and again that you would give up drinking, but you are always {{breaking}} your promise, and now I find that in spite of all I've said, you still hold with those bad men at Dareport, and that you have taken to poaching, and now they are in search <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> one of those concerned in desperately wounding John Morton. No, George, I have for years withstood even my father. I have loved you in spite of his reproaches and entreaties, but I feel now that instead of your making me happy I should be utterly miserable if I married you, and I have made a promise to Miss Carne that I would give you up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is unspeakably {{generous in}} {{you to put}} it all before me so nicely, Christopher. I think {{infinitely}} more <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> so unreserved, especially since I too have been thinking much on the indefiniteness of the days to come. We are not numbered among the blest few who can afford to trifle with the time. Yet to agree to anything like a positive parting will be quite unnecessary. You did not mean that, did you? for it is harsh if you did.' Ethelberta smiled kindly as she said this, as much as to say that she was far from really upbraiding him. 'Let it be only that we will see each other less. We will bear one another in mind as deeply attached friends if not as definite lovers, and keep up friendly remembrances of a sort which, come what may, will never have to be ended by any painful process termed breaking off. Different persons, different natures; {{and it may be that}} marriage would not be the most favourable atmosphere for our old affection to prolong itself in. When do you leave London?' ...|$|E
50|$|My {{quilting}} career gave me {{the opportunity}} to travel the world: Japan, Australia, Canada, Norway, France, England, South Africa and many other countries. Quilting friends from across the United States have been an important part of my life, having always been enthusiastic and supportive in whatever I did. I was never far from home when I was with quilters. As wonderful as teaching and traveling were, getting back to Fresno felt like coming home. It has been wonderful being here with <b>you.</b> To all <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> thanks <b>for</b> <b>being</b> with me on this journey.|$|R
40|$|Writing a {{dissertation}} was {{the most}} time consuming, grueling test of endurance that I have experienced.

Your guidance motivated me to keep pushing ahead, calculating statistics and writing chapters, even though my teaching responsibilities and the arrival of my son often made writing the last thing I wanted to do. I appreciate how you responded so promptly to my phone calls and emails when I needed direction. My research and writing skills have improved because <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> Thanks <b>for</b> <b>being</b> such a great colleague. My committee. I want to thank Dr. Adrienne Hyle, Dr. Tom Weir...|$|R

The Doctor tells me {{they are going to}} open fire, and it is not the least use your going there exposing {{yourself}} to be shot when you know that <b>you</b> will be <b>of</b> no use. <b>You</b> showed us yesterday that <b>you</b> could be <b>of</b> use in other ways, and I have no doubt you will have opportunities of doing so again. I can assure <b>you</b> none <b>of</b> us will think any the worse <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> not <b>being</b> able to struggle against a nervous affliction that gives you infinite pain. If they were attacking it would be different; I know you would be wanting to take your share then." ...|$|R

40|$|Let me {{thank all}} <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> here, Tony Starace, for having {{conceived}} this meeting, and Bob Wood and Matesh Varma, for over 20 years of support without which {{there would have}} been no track physics. There are many others to thank: the students, postdoctorates, and senior visitors who actually did all the work, and the many investigators around the world who made measurements that proved to be essential to developing and testing the notions of particle tracks. This enterprise began when I undertook to rewrite an introductory physics text by Henry Semat to adapt it to a calculus-based course. That became Physics, by Henry Semat and Robert Katz, published in 1958. In that writ-ing I became persuaded of the beauty of the magnetic monopole as a pedagogic device in the teaching of elec...|$|E
40|$|I {{thank my}} supervisor, Karen Smith, for her {{excellent}} guidance {{during the years}} of my doctoral studies. Without her support, expertise and, most importantly, encouragement this dissertation would not exist the way it does now. Also, I thank Matthew Emerton for some helpful conversations and for entrusting me with early manuscripts of [EK 99, EK 00], both of which enhanced my understanding of the subject of this dissertation greatly. I thank my parents for their support and trust, that, whatever it is their son is doing (mathematics?), he must know what is best for him. I don’t know where they get this idea from, but it sure is comforting. Many other people had a subtle impact on my life, thereby influencing my mathematical career too.

[...] "The tradespeople have harassed me--not because I could not pay them certainly, but because I could not add up their bills. Never owe any man enough, Zack, {{to give him the}} chance <b>of</b> punishing <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> in his debt, with a sum to do in simple addition. At the time when I had bills (go on with your drawing; you can listen, and draw too), I used, of course, to think it necessary to check the tradespeople, and see that their Total was right. You will hardly believe me, but I don't remember ever making the sum what the shop made it, on more than about three occasions. And, what was worse, if I tried a second time, I could not even get it to agree with what I had made it myself the first time. Thank Heaven, I've no difficulties of that sort to grapple with now! Everything's paid for the moment it comes in. If the butcher hands a leg of mutton to the cook over the airey railings, the cook hands him back six and nine--or whatever it is--and takes his bill and receipt. I eat my dinners now, with the blessed conviction that they won't all disagree with me in an arithmetical point of view {{at the end of the}} year. What are you stopping and scratching your head for in that way?" ...|$|R

40|$|I {{dedicate}} {{this document}} to {{teachers who have}} changed my life in some way and who have helped fuel my passion for educating others, working with children, and following my heart. Thank you to those teachers who have taught and mentored me {{over the years and}} to those with whom I have worked to envision new approaches to classroom teaching. You all have inspired me to move forward with the efficacy, internalization of values and ideals, and the courage to be the teacher that I am today.

40|$|I {{am deeply}} {{grateful}} {{to a number}} of people who have aided me in innumerable ways through the past three years of my PhD. Professor Onur Güntürkün, my chief supervisor, who sanctioned these quirky ideas and allowed me abundant freedom in pursuing this ambitious project. Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity, for your support and readiness to experiment with new avenues, and for always being so approachable. Professor Irene Daum, my second supervisor, who was involved from the inception of this project and organised the testing of the patients with schizophrenia at the University Clinic. Thank you for setting up that study and for your continual support. Sabine Windmann, whose involvement with the project beginning from about a year ago gave it a much-needed boost.
