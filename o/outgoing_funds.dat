50|$|A {{paymaster}} is usually, but {{not required}} to be, a lawyer (also known as a 'lawyer paymaster'). When dealing with commission payments on contracts dealing with {{large amounts of money}} (such as Oil, Gas, Steel, Iron, Gold, MTN's, VG's, T-Strips, and other instruments), most banks in the United States are very wary of handling such large amounts of money.

In most cases, the buyer and the seller involved in the transaction require a paymaster be named to handle all incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>funds.</b>|$|E
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. We examine {{whether there is}} a {{relationship}} between foreign equity trading and average total volatility, measured as the value-weighted average of stock-return variance in the Istanbul Stock Exchange. We employ foreign equity purchase and sale data to track changes in foreign equity trading, which not only enable us to capture effective foreign investor participation but also to observe the potential asymmetric effects of incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>funds</b> on the average total volatility.

Operating expenses were high, at 83% of gross revenue; every train required five engines: the three stationary engines and two on the level sections. The <b>outgoings</b> left inadequate <b>funds</b> to service the loan debt.|$|R
5000|$|The {{significance}} of a UK trading fund {{is that it has}} standing authority under the 1973 Act touse its receipts to meet its expenses or <b>outgoings.</b> Some trading <b>funds</b> have, as their main function, the collection and supply of information to both public and private sectors; others do not. Also in the UK, a trading fund can only be established with the agreement of HM Treasury. To establish a fund, more than 50% of the trading fund's revenue will consist of receipts for goods and services provided by the department, and where the responsible minister and the Treasury are satisfied that the setting up of the trading fund will lead to [...] "improved efficiency and effectiveness in management of operations".|$|R
