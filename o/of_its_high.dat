5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> neutron cross-section, boron-10 {{is often}} used to control fission in nuclear {{reactors}} as a neutron-capturing substance. Several industrial-scale enrichment processes have been developed; however, only the fractionated vacuum distillation of the dimethyl ether adduct of boron trifluoride (DME-BF3) and column chromatography of borates are being used.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> salt concentration, {{the lake}} water is unusually dense, {{and most people}} can float more easily than in other bodies of water, {{particularly}} in Gunnison Bay, the saltier north arm of the lake.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{suspected}} of having DVT may be assessed using a clinical prediction rule such as the Wells score. A D-dimer test may {{also be used to}} assist with excluding the diagnosis (because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> sensitivity) or to signal a need for further testing. Diagnosis is most commonly done with ultrasound of the suspected veins.|$|E
5|$|Steel is an alloy of {{iron and}} carbon with trace amounts of other elements. Because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> tensile {{strength}} and low cost, {{it is a major}} component used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, appliances, and weapons.|$|E
5|$|Barium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBa and atomic number56. It {{is the fifth}} element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery alkaline earth metal. Because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> chemical reactivity, barium is never found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern history as baryta, does not occur as a mineral, but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate.|$|E

5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> {{resistance}} to P.cinnamomi dieback, {{the feasibility of}} using B.integrifolia as a rootstock for susceptible Banksia species in the cut flower trade is under investigation. Presently, the success rate for grafting is only 30–40%, and even with successful grafts {{there is a tendency}} for the union to fail under stress. More research is needed before the technique will be ready for commercial use.|$|E
5|$|Deathrow {{received}} largely favorable reviews. Reviewers {{praised the}} game's fast-paced action, and surround sound, but complained <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> difficulty curve, generic soundtrack, {{and lack of}} online multiplayer. Some critics felt the game's use of profanity was excessive, while others {{thought it was a}} highlight. Reviewers considered the game's concept and mechanics similar to other series, specifically Speedball. IGN and TeamXbox both named Deathrow an Editor's Choice. The game won the TeamXbox 2002 Breakthrough Game of the Year award and the IGN 2002 Best Game Nobody Played. IGN later reported that a sequel would be unlikely due to the original's low revenue. Southend dissolved in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Hexagonal BN {{was first}} used in {{cosmetics}} around 1940 in Japan. However, because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> price, h-BN was soon abandoned for this application. Its use was revitalized in the late 1990s with the optimization h-BN production processes, and currently h-BN is used by nearly all leading producers of cosmetic products for foundations, make-up, eye shadows, blushers, kohl pencils, lipsticks and other skincare products.|$|E

5|$|In February 2009, President Barack Obama asked Secretary of Defense Robert Gates about {{placing the}} project on hold or {{canceling}} it because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> cost: over $13billion for the planned 28 helicopters. In June 2009, the U.S. Navy terminated the contract after spending about $4.4 billion and taking delivery of nine VH-71s. In {{the aftermath of the}} cancellation, the delivered helicopters were sold onto Canada for $164 million, where they were used as a source of spare parts for its fleet of AgustaWestland CH-149 Cormorant search-and-rescue helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Karnataka's {{smallest}} district, Kodagu, is a {{major contributor}} to Indian field hockey, producing numerous players who have represented India at the international level. The annual Kodava Hockey Festival is the largest hockey tournament in the world. Bangalore has hosted a WTA tennis event and, in 1997, it hosted the fourth National Games of India. The Sports Authority of India, the premier sports institute in the country, and the Nike Tennis Academy are also situated in Bangalore. Karnataka has been referred to as the cradle of Indian swimming because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> standards in comparison to other states.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 20th century, lithium {{became an}} {{important}} component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, {{should not be confused with}} lithium batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode. Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.|$|E

25|$|PVC is a polymer {{with good}} {{insulation}} properties, but because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>higher</b> polar nature the electrical insulating property is inferior to non polar polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene.|$|R
5|$|Most other binary alloys are {{of little}} use: for example, silver–gold alloys are too soft and silver–cadmium alloys too toxic. Ternary alloys have much greater importance: dental {{amalgams}} are usually silver–tin–mercury alloys, silver–copper–gold alloys {{are very important}} in jewellery (usually on the gold-rich side) and have a vast range of hardnesses and colours, silver–copper–zinc alloys are useful as low-melting brazing alloys, and silver–cadmium–indium (involving three adjacent elements on the periodic table) is useful in nuclear reactors because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> thermal neutron capture cross-section, good conduction of heat, mechanical stability, and resistance to corrosion in hot water.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra {{settled in}} San Juan in 1814. He {{had a new}} son, Pedro Cornelio, and {{maintained}} a simple life growing grapes. He awaited the final decision of Posadas, but the supreme director had a political crisis at the time. The Spanish king Ferdinand VII {{had returned to the}} throne and demanded the colonies to return to their former organization, the royalists at Upper Peru were still a threat, and José Gervasio Artigas opposed Buenos Aires as well, because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> centralism. As a result, Carlos María de Alvear became the new supreme director, who would decide the final fate of Cornelio Saavedra.|$|E
5|$|Silver is very {{important}} in electronics for conductors and electrodes on account <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> electrical conductivity even when tarnished. Bulk silver and silver foils were used to make vacuum tubes, and continue to be used today in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, circuits, and their components. For example, silver is used in high quality connectors for RF, VHF, and higher frequencies, particularly in tuned circuits such as cavity filters where conductors cannot be scaled by more than 6%. Printed circuits and RFID antennas are made with silver paints, Powdered silver and its alloys are used in paste preparations for conductor layers and electrodes, ceramic capacitors, and other ceramic components.|$|E

5|$|Some {{noble gases}} have direct {{application}} in medicine. Helium is sometimes {{used to improve}} the ease of breathing of asthma sufferers. Xenon is used as an anesthetic because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> solubility in lipids, which makes it more potent than the usual nitrous oxide, {{and because it is}} readily eliminated from the body, resulting in faster recovery. Xenon finds application in medical imaging of the lungs through hyperpolarized MRI. Radon, which is highly radioactive and is only available in minute amounts, is used in radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|The +4 {{oxidation}} state dominates titanium chemistry, but compounds in the +3 {{oxidation state}} are also common. Commonly, titanium adopts an octahedral coordination geometry in its complexes, but tetrahedral TiCl4 is a notable exception. Because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> oxidation state, titanium(IV) compounds exhibit {{a high degree}} of covalent bonding. Unlike most other transition metals, simple aquo Ti(IV) complexes are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{most active}} volcanoes are Kelud and Merapi on Java island {{which have been}} {{responsible}} for thousands of deaths in the region. Since AD 1000, Kelut has erupted more than 30 times, of which the largest eruption was at scale 5 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), while Mount Merapi has erupted more than 80 times. The International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior has named Mount Merapi as a Decade Volcano since 1995 because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>high</b> volcanic activity.|$|E
