5|$|Ependymal cells {{actively}} regulate neuronal fate specification <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> neural precursors through {{release of}} Noggin.

Microglia also actively regulate adult neurogenesis. Under basal conditions, apoptotic corpses of newly generated neurons are rapidly phagocytosed from the niche by unactivated microglia in the adult SGZ. Under inflammatory conditions, reactivated microglia can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on different aspects <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> neurogenesis, depending on the balance between secreted molecules with pro- and anti-inflammatory action.

Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{dental caries}} and periodontal pocketing {{in relation to}} saliva buffering capacity among two groups <b>of</b> Japanese <b>adults</b> aged above 35 years old (A 35) or 35 years old and below (B 35). Methods: After measuring the initial pH of saliva, samples were titrated with 0. 1 N HCl to evaluate the buffer capacity. Levels of mutans streptococci and Lactobacilli in saliva, DMF and periodontal pocket were also measured. Results: Among B 35 group, DMF <b>of</b> <b>adults</b> with High buffering capacity was significantly lower than those <b>of</b> <b>adults</b> with Medium and Low buffering capacity (p 0. 05). There were statistical differences for the mean periodontal pocket depth on the upper right incisor <b>of</b> <b>adults</b> in A 35 with High buffer capacity and those <b>of</b> <b>adults</b> with any buffer capacity in B 35 group. Statistical differences were also found for the pocket depth on lower left incisor and upper right molars <b>of</b> <b>adults</b> in A 35 with High buffer capacity and those <b>of</b> <b>adults</b> with low buffer capacity in B 35 group (p< 0. 01).
