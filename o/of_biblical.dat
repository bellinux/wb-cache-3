Early Northwest Semitic (ENWS) materials are attested from 2350BCE to 1200BCE, {{the end of the}} Bronze Age. The Northwest Semitic languages, including Hebrew, differentiated noticeably during the Iron Age (1200–540BCE), although in its earliest stages Biblical Hebrew was not highly differentiated from Ugaritic and the Canaanite of the Amarna letters.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes towards suicide slowly {{began to}} shift during the Renaissance.

5|$|A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament: For the Use <b>of</b> <b>Biblical</b> Students {{is one of}} {{the books}} of Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener (1813–1891), biblical scholar and textual critic.

5|$|Around 1924 Whorf {{first became}} {{interested}} in linguistics. Originally he analyzed Biblical texts, seeking to uncover hidden layers of meaning. Inspired by the esoteric work La langue hebraïque restituée by Antoine Fabre d'Olivet, he began a semantic and grammatical analysis <b>of</b> <b>Biblical</b> Hebrew. Whorf's early manuscripts on Hebrew and Maya {{have been described as}} exhibiting a considerable degree of mysticism, as he sought to uncover esoteric meanings of glyphs and letters.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Zara Yaqob assumed the throne, the Ethiopian church had been divided {{over the issue}} <b>of</b> <b>Biblical</b> Sabbath {{observance}} for roughly a century. One group, loyal to the Coptic bishops, believed that the day of rest should be observed only on Sunday, or Great Sabbath; another group, the followers of Ewostatewos, believed with their founder that both the original seventh-day Sabbath (i.e., Saturday, or Lesser Sabbath) and Sunday should be observed.|$|E
5|$|Both {{types of}} Bede's {{theological}} works circulated widely in the Middle Ages.

Some of Bede's homilies were collected by Paul the Deacon, and they were used in that form in the Monastic Office. Saint Boniface used Bede's homilies in his missionary efforts on the continent.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} depictions of Jesus at the Dura-Europos church are firmly dated to before 256.

5|$|The Codex Sinaiticus {{came to the}} {{attention}} of scholars in the 19th century at Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, with further material discovered in the 20th and 21st centuries. Although parts of the codex are scattered across four libraries around the world, most of the manuscript is today vested in the British Library in London, where it is on public display. Since its discovery, study of the Codex Sinaiticus has proven to be useful to scholars for critical studies <b>of</b> <b>biblical</b> text.|$|E
5|$|The Ormulum or Orrmulum is a twelfth-century work <b>of</b> <b>biblical</b> exegesis, {{written by}} a monk named Orm (or Ormin) and {{consisting}} of just under 19,000 lines of early Middle English verse.

Consequently, it is invaluable to philologists and historical linguists in tracing the development of the language.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{his life}} Whorf was a {{chemical}} engineer by profession, {{but as a}} young man he took up an interest in linguistics. At first this interest drew him to the study <b>of</b> <b>Biblical</b> Hebrew, but he quickly went on to study the indigenous languages of Mesoamerica on his own. Professional scholars were impressed by his work and in 1930 he received a grant to study the Nahuatl language in Mexico; on his return home he presented several influential papers on the language at linguistics conferences.|$|E
5|$|While Darwinian {{evolution}} {{never became}} an issue for northern Presbyterians as most accommodated themselves {{to some form of}} theistic evolution, the new discipline <b>of</b> <b>biblical</b> interpretation known as higher criticism would become highly controversial. Utilizing comparative linguistics, archaeology, and literary analysis, German proponents of high criticism, such as Julius Wellhausen and David Friedrich Strauss, began questioning long-held assumptions about the Bible. At the forefront of the controversy in the PCUSA was Charles A. Briggs, a professor at PCUSA's Union Theological Seminary in New York.|$|E
