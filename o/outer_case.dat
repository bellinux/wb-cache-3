25|$|Both Italian and {{northern}} schools produced a miniature virginals called the ottavino. Ottavini were pitched an octave {{higher than the}} larger instrument. In the Flemish tradition these were often – perhaps always – sold together with a large virginals, to which the ottavino could be coupled (see Double Virginals below). In the Italian tradition, an ottavino was usually a separate instrument of its own, being fitted in its own <b>outer</b> <b>case,</b> just like larger Italian instruments.|$|E

25|$|Across the 15th and 16th centuries {{there were}} {{primarily}} {{two different types}} of manufactured cannons. The wrought iron cannon and the cast-bronze cannon. Wrought iron guns were structurally composed of two layers: an inner tube of iron staves held together in a tight fit by an <b>outer</b> <b>case</b> of iron hoops. Bronze cannons on the other hand were cast in one piece similar to bells. The technique used in casting bronze cannons was so similar to the bell that the two were often looked upon as a connected enterprise. Church bells in the age of Catholic authority were viewed as idolatrous and met their end as raw metal used for casting cannons.|$|E
2500|$|Wirewound {{resistors}} {{are commonly}} made by winding a metal wire, usually nichrome, around a ceramic, plastic, or fiberglass core. The {{ends of the}} wire are soldered or welded to two caps or rings, attached {{to the ends of}} the core. The assembly is protected with a layer of paint, molded plastic, or an enamel coating baked at high temperature. These resistors are designed to withstand unusually high temperatures of up to 450°C. Wire leads in low power wirewound resistors are usually between 0.6 and 0.8mm in diameter and tinned for ease of soldering. For higher power wirewound resistors, either a ceramic <b>outer</b> <b>case</b> or an aluminum <b>outer</b> <b>case</b> on top of an insulating layer is used – if the <b>outer</b> <b>case</b> is ceramic, such resistors are sometimes described as [...] "cement" [...] resistors, though they do not actually contain any traditional cement. The aluminum-cased types are designed to be attached to a heat sink to dissipate the heat; the rated power is dependent on being used with a suitable heat sink, e.g., a 50 W power rated resistor overheats at a fraction of the power dissipation if not used with a heat sink. Large wirewound resistors may be rated for 1,000 watts or more.|$|E

[...] A large harpsichord is, in a sense, {{a piece of}} furniture, as it stands alone on legs and may be styled {{in the manner of}} other furniture of its place and period. [...] Early Italian instruments, on the other hand, were so light in construction that they were treated rather like a violin: kept for storage in a protective <b>outer</b> <b>case,</b> and played after taking it out of its case and placing it on a table. [...] Such tables were often quite high – until the late 18th century people usually played standing up. [...] Eventually, harpsichords came to be built with just a single case, though an intermediate stage also existed: [...] the false inner–outer, which for purely aesthetic reasons was built to look as if the <b>outer</b> <b>case</b> contained an inner one, in the old style. [...] Even after harpsichords became self-encased objects, they often were supported by separate stands, and some modern harpsichords have separate legs for improved portability.|$|E

2500|$|Spinet virginals (not to be {{confused}} with the spinet) were made principally in Italy (Italian: spinetta), England and Flanders (...) [...] The keyboard is placed left of centre, and the strings are plucked at one end, although further from the bridge than in the harpsichord. This is the more common arrangement for modern instruments, and an instrument described simply as a [...] "virginal" [...] is likely to be a spinet virginals. The principal differences in construction lie mainly in the placement of the keyboard: Italian instruments invariably had a keyboard that projected from the case, whilst northern virginals had their keyboards recessed in a keywell. The cases of Italian instruments were made of cypress wood and were of delicate manufacture, whilst northern virginals were usually more stoutly constructed of poplar. Early Italian virginals were usually hexagonal in shape, the case following the lines of the strings and bridges, and a few early Flemish examples are similarly made. From about 1580 however, nearly all virginals were rectangular, the Italian models often having an <b>outer</b> <b>case</b> like harpsichords from that country. There are very few surviving English virginals, all of them late. They generally follow the Flemish construction, but with a vaulted lid.|$|E
