25|$|Current fission {{reactors}} {{in operation}} {{around the world}} are second or third generation systems, with most of the first-generation systems having been retired some time ago. Research into advanced generation IV reactor types was officially started by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals, including to improve nuclear safety, improve proliferation resistance, minimize waste, improve natural resource utilization, the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity, and decrease the cost to build and run such plants. Most of these reactors differ significantly from current <b>operating</b> <b>light</b> water reactors, and are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{measuring}} the quality of <b>lighting</b> in <b>operating</b> rooms. <b>Operating</b> <b>lights</b> are very demanding in terms of quality requirements for each parameter, so {{it is important to}} specify exactly these parameters and check them regurarly. To measure the quality of the light source, was used a special kit from Maquet. Measurement procedure was not as accurate as it was for <b>operating</b> <b>lighting</b> need, therefore, this work includes a proposal to improve the measurement of quality <b>lighting</b> in <b>operating</b> theaters. In cooperation with University Hospital Brno Bohunice University Hospital Motol and the company Maquet measured nine <b>operating</b> <b>lights,</b> each light were compared in terms of parameters such as maximum light intensity, light distribution in the surgical field. In each category were selected several lighting, which reached the best results. The various parameters were compared with values declared by the manufacturer...|$|R

50|$|CC1 {{was first}} steamed in July 1957 and began main line trials the {{following}} month. Between August and October, the locomotive ran 2,147 miles (3,444 km). Most test runs {{were on the}} Dublin-Cork main line; two runs went to Cork and back, and others terminated at points between Hazelhatch and Portarlington. One run (<b>operating</b> <b>light</b> engine) was made to Mullingar and back, on the former Midland Great Western main line, but ride quality suffered on this route's sharp curves. A review of the trial results by Bulleid's assistant, John Click (a secondee from BR) showed that the locomotive generally performed well, with excellent riding (apart from the above exception) at speeds up to 70 mph (113 km/h); much of the test running was at high speeds. Turf consumption and noise levels were also very favourable.|$|E
