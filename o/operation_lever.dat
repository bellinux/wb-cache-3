5000|$|The APS-95 was a {{conventional}} select-fire assault rifle operating via a gas-driven piston and employing a 35-rounds detachable magazine for 5'56mm ammunition, in all {{similar to the}} ones used in the Israeli Galil or South-African R4 assault rifles. The APS-95 was made around a stamped receiver, rather than the refined milled receiver of the Galil and R4, thus achieving reduction in cost and manufacturing time. Its fire selector was based upon two distinct commands located {{on both sides of the}} rifle, similarly to the Galil and Vektor R4 but different in <b>operation.</b> The <b>lever</b> located on the right side of the receiver, based upon the AK-47 selector, had only two positions: lowered for [...] "Fire" [...] and raised for [...] "Safe" [...] (when raised, it blocked the bolt working as a dust cover). The small switch located over the grip on the left side of the receiver, at easy thumb reach, had two positions for semi-automatic and full-automatic fire. The folding stock was made out of stamped steel, and folded on the right side of the receiver; its profile didn't caused any hindrance to the handling of the weapon nor to the operation of the bolt - as such, the APS-95 could be safely fired with the stock folded.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the researched changeover from Operational Excellence (OE) {{to the new}} path of Operations Excellence (OsE). Operational Excellence (OE) predominantly deals with the efficiency (productivity), effectiveness (customer/market orientation) and optimization of production processes. In comparison, Operations Excellence (OsE) enlarges that perspective to see <b>operations</b> as setting <b>lever</b> by providing enablers as a central role for operational long-term success. The assessment of required against existing setting of enabler criteria in an organization (e. g., high performance culture, methods and instruments, employee empowerment, etc.) supports to become a plant's future health foreseeable and to identify its capability to achieve sustainability and excellence in terms of operations. To support a methodical integration of Operations Excellence in organizations, an OsE assessment framework has been developed within the applied research project “IMFT”. The model design containing the identification of relevant criteria and their cause-effect relationships {{is a key element}} of the present paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A shift force {{simulator}} for {{manual transmission}} is developed {{to estimate the}} shift force that is transmitted to the driver’s hand. In order to develop the simulator, dynamic models of the external linkage, internal linkage, synchronizer and drivetrain are obtained. The synchronizing motion is modelled as seven steps depending on {{the relative displacement of}} the sleeve to the ring spring, outer ring chamfer and gear chamfer. The chamfer-to-chamfer contact mechanism is modelled as a linear spring. In addition, a driver model is proposed to simulate the driver’s shift <b>lever</b> <b>operation.</b> Based on the dynamic model of each element, a shift force simulator is developed. The simulator calculates the sleeve displacement, cone torque, index torque, sleeve force, shift force and the speed of the input and output shaft. It is found that the shift force by the simulator shows a good correlation with the test results, and it is expected that the shift force simulator developed in this study {{can be used as a}} useful design tool to evaluate the shift feeling in the initial design stage...|$|R

Two kinds of devices {{have been used}} in our ~ laboratory and were found to be deficient. The standard drinkometer-equipped water bottle (with or without ball-bearing tips) was subject to leakage, particularly when ethanol-water solutions were used. This finding has also been reported by others (Amit, Amir and Corcoran, 1973). A second problem with water bottles is that intermittent reinforcement with liquid is dif-ficult.

40|$|The {{effect of}} ethanol on the {{cigarette}} smoking of alcoholic subjects was studied {{in a residential}} laboratory. During daily 6 -hr sessions, cigarettes were obtained either by request to the ward staff or by <b>operation</b> of a <b>lever</b> (fixed-ratio 5 or 10). In a mixed sequence across days, sessions involved ingestion of either vehicle (orange juice or vehicle plus ethanol (133. 7 g). During ethanol sessions, the rate of cigarette smoking increased from 26 % to 117 % of vehicle levels. A series of control studies eliminated a number of potential behavorial mechanisms for the observed effect and indicated that the ethanol-induced increase in cigarette smoking occurred {{under a variety of}} experimental conditions: (1) when smoking could not occur concurrently with ethanol or vehicle consumption; (2) when subjects were not allowed to socialize; (3) when ingestion of ethanol or vehicle was scheduled for a number of consecutive days; (4) when various doses of ethanol were administered under blind conditions. In control experiments, weighing unsmoked tobacco and counting the number of puffs per cigarette indicated the effect was not due to smoking less of each cigarette. The effect was not limited to the experimental sessions alone, since total daily smoking was higher on ethanol days than vehicle days...|$|R
40|$|This thesis, {{entitled}} "The {{significance of}} the exchange rate by the international investment decision", deals with {{the influence of the}} exchange rate on the rate of return and on the risk rate of foreign currency portfolio investments, applied on dollar share investments and dollar equity bonds {{from the point of view}} of a euro investor. In this thesis, the influence of exchange rate EUR/USD on the rate of return and the risk rate of specified investments is quantified and evaluated, for investment horizons of different lengths, which are always adapted to a specified type of financial assets. Concerning the share investments, the basic investment horizons are: 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years and 22 years. Concerning the equity bonds investments, the basic investment horizons are: 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, 10 years and 12 years. The influence of the exchange rate in the speculative <b>operations</b> with <b>lever</b> tools, specifically in futures contracts. The methodology of this thesis deals with methods of quantification and evaluation of the influence of the exchange rate on the rate of return and the risk rate of foreign currency investments. These methods are afterwards applied in the realization of other sectorial empirical analyses of the influence of the exchange rate EUR/USD on the rate of return and on the risk rate of dollar investments in the specified types of financial assets within the frame of the specified investments horizons, always from the point of view of the euro investor. The specified hypotheses are evaluated on the basis of the achieved results from the empirical analyses and they are also compared with another theses with similar topics. The achieved results, with a view to retail investors, also enable to propose and consult the sub-measures, which can reduce the influence of the exchange rate on the rate of return and on the risk rate of their foreign currency investments. Another ways of solving these problems also emerge from this thesis and their results will have the possibility to be compared with the results of this thesis...|$|R
40|$|When {{talking about}} Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs) {{in the private}} equity industry, very few {{findings}} have been performed so far on the prominent role of the financing package and the overall capital structure as drivers for creating value for the investors of the fund. Unlike most of the existent research, we investigate value creation under the private equity fund perspective, analyzing the debt financing package used to fund the LBO <b>operation</b> as a <b>lever</b> to deliver value to the specific investors of the fund. More specifically, {{in the first part}} of this research project we analyzed how debt evolved, in terms of composition and tools used, starting from the very outset of this phenomenon in the 1980 s up to the financial crisis of 2007. For this section, our observations and results stemmed from a literature review process on the matter. We then proceeded with an empirical part that had the aim of shedding light on how debt evolved after 2007, by means of a survey sent to a sample of private equity firms. In particular, we attempted to detect possible patterns that might have emerged, in terms of changes of instruments utilized and the overall composition. Hence, we linked those patterns to possible aspects of value creation for the investors of the fund, besides approaching such results to some other relevant aspects of the LBO value creation process, to make our analysis more effective...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the causes}} of {{malnutrition}} among the rural inhabitants of Sub-Saharan Africa is the high cost of dietary fats that are necessary to maintain normal body functions. Though the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN recommends an annual intake of 9. 6 liters of dietary fats a year per person, some areas of Africa consume only about 1. 5 liters annually. Many members of these communities lack the resources to purchase imported edible oils; locally produced peanut oil would provide a cheaper alternative. In addition, peanut production is particularly beneficial to farmers, as peanut plants enrich the soil they grow in. Once they have a steady supply of peanuts, the problem facing farmers is the inability to efficiently extract the oil from the nuts. The current design for human-powered rapid extraction is the Bielenberg ram press, which uses a lever to generate the required pressure needed to extract the oil. However, this design is not optimal for two reasons: it requires significant upper body strength to operate, and also, incorrect <b>operation</b> of the <b>lever</b> leads to {{only a fraction of the}} peanuts' oil content being extracted. For these reasons, this thesis focuses on a design modification originally proposed by a team in D-Lab Spring 2006. (cont.) While the oil extracting mechanism was kept intact, the lever was replaced by a cam-and-follower system driven by treadles. By moving the driving motion from the upper body to the lower body of the user, the new design aims to address the ergonomics issue present in the Bielenberg ram press. The cam also allows optimization of the pressure profile for the peanuts. Research performed by Ravi Patel in 2007 has shown that a rapid buildup followed by a long period of followed by a gradual advancing of the piston will create the desired pressure characteristics to maximize output. An earlier attempt to convert the Bielenberg ram press into a treadle design yielded several insights into how the design could be improved. These insights have led to many design modifications, which are incorporated into the proposed redesign. This redesign is aimed at improving performance, reducing cost, and increasing the manufacturability of the press. by Daipan Lee. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|A {{group of}} socially-housed chimpanzees, {{maintained}} in a zoo facility, {{were given the}} opportunity to access each of several purpose-designed and built enrichment items. Each item was made freely available in the chimpanzees' regular setting, with their normal activities available. The time members of the group spent engaging with each item gave an assessment of their relative preference for the items. The group were shown to have the greatest preference for a foraging enrichment item (Screwfeeder) and the least preference for an audiovisual enrichment item (TV/Video). Individual preferences for the items were evident. The chimpanzees were then taught to operate a weighted lever to get access to an item. Once all chimpanzees had operated the lever for access to the items, the number of <b>lever</b> <b>operations</b> required for access to each item was systematically doubled over a series of 3 hr sessions until the chimpanzees did not gain any access to that item for two consecutive sessions. One item was presented for two series of increases. The group response rates for an item increased with increased response requirement and then decreased with further increases, reflecting data from individuals in other research. The highest response requirement that maintained the group behaviour differed over the items. The number of times an item was accessed (consumption) was plotted against the response requirement (price) on logarithmic coordinates. Lines fitted to the data (demand functions) were shallowest for a foraging enrichment (Screwfeeder) and steepest for the audio enrichment (Musicbox). There were not enough data points to fit a function for the audiovisual enrichment. Differences in individual's demand within the group were evident. In general, the rank order of preference for the items and the rank order based on the parameters of the demand functions (slope or elasticity and initial intensity) was broadly the same. Three individual chimpanzees were exposed to two series of increasing response requirement for access to the Screwfeeder whilst housed alone, in one hour sessions. Response rates were again bitonic and the linear demand functions for these individuals were steeper (more elastic) than the functions fitted to data for group responding and differed idiosyncratically from the data for these individual when responding as part of the group. Thus the change of social setting had a different impact on the behaviour of each of the individuals. These results show that an animals‟ demand for a commodity is altered by the environment in which it is tested. ii Overall the research provides the first example of operant methodology in a zoo setting with a group of chimpanzees. It is also the first research to show differential responding for access to different enrichment items by a group and how this relates to their preference (based on time allocation) for those items...|$|R
