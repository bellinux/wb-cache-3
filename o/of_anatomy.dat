5|$|The Regius Professor <b>of</b> <b>Anatomy</b> at Aberdeen University, John Struthers {{dissected}} the whale, much of {{the time}} in public with a military band playing in the background, organised by Woods. The decomposing whale made Woods a great deal of money, and Struthers famous.|$|E
5|$|A {{week later}} the whale was found dead, {{floating}} out at sea. It was towed to Stonehaven and dragged onto the beach. John Struthers, the Regius professor <b>of</b> <b>Anatomy</b> at Aberdeen, quickly visited the carcass, recording it as 40 feet long with flukes measuring 11 feet 4 inches. A local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale {{and had it}} transported to his yard in Dundee. On the first Sunday that it was there, 12,000 people paid to see it.|$|E
40|$|The proper {{performance}} of a post-mortem inspection requires a good knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> the slaughtered animal species. The aim of this chapter is to offer an inspective {{point of view of}} the anatomical structures perceived during a post-mortem inspection and to discuss the available inspective tools. In particular, the chapter focuses on the inspective <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> pigs, large and small ruminants and poultry. To describe the <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> pigs, ruminants and poultry, the inspective anatomy has been divided into the <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> the head, <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> viscera, <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> the carcass and <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> poultry. The anatomical characteristics of pig, bovine and small ruminants are similar and are discussed together in the first three sections of the chapter, while the <b>anatomy</b> <b>of</b> poultry is discussed separately...|$|R
50|$|In 1682 {{appeared}} {{his great}} {{work on the}} <b>Anatomy</b> <b>of</b> Plants, which also was largely a collection of previous publications. It was divided into four books, <b>Anatomy</b> <b>of</b> Vegetables begun, <b>Anatomy</b> <b>of</b> Roots, <b>Anatomy</b> <b>of</b> Trunks and <b>Anatomy</b> <b>of</b> Leaves, Flowers, Fruits and Seeds, and was illustrated with eighty-two plates, while appended to it were seven papers mostly of a chemical character. The Anatomy is especially notable for its descriptions of plant structure. He described nearly all the key differences of morphology of stem and root, showed that the flowers of the Asteraceae are built of multiple units, and correctly hypothesized that stamens are male organs. <b>Anatomy</b> <b>of</b> Plants also contains the first known microscopic description of pollen.|$|R

5|$|Among {{the qualities}} that make Leonardo's work unique are his {{innovative}} techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge <b>of</b> <b>anatomy,</b> light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the Mona Lisa, the Last Supper, and the Virgin of the Rocks.|$|E
5|$|Andreas Vesalius (1514â€“1564) (Latinized from Andries van Wezel), {{professor}} <b>of</b> <b>anatomy</b> at the University of Padua, {{is considered}} the founder of modern human anatomy. Originally from Brabant, Vesalius published the influential book De humani corporis fabrica ("the structure of the human body"), a large format book in seven volumes, in 1543. The accurate and intricately detailed illustrations, often in allegorical poses against Italianate landscapes, {{are thought to have}} been made by the artist Jan van Calcar, a pupil of Titian.|$|E
5|$|Dental anatomy {{is a field}} <b>of</b> <b>anatomy</b> {{dedicated}} {{to the study of}} tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though dental occlusion, or contact between teeth, does not. Dental anatomy is also a taxonomic science as it is concerned with the naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.|$|E

5|$|Henry Herbert Southey, {{physician}} to the recently deceased George IV, had travelled in the Duke's train, as had Dr Hunter, professor <b>of</b> <b>anatomy</b> at the University of Edinburgh. The {{two of them}} rushed to Huskisson's side, joined shortly afterwards by Joseph Brandreth, a Liverpool surgeon who had been travelling behind Phoenix. The doctors suggested returning Huskisson to Liverpool for treatment, but George Stephenson insisted {{that it would be}} better to take him on to Manchester.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medical}} profession, {{he was known}} for {{transforming}} the teaching <b>of</b> <b>anatomy,</b> for the papers and books that he wrote, {{as well as for}} his efficient work in his medical school, for which he was successively awarded medicine's highest honours, including membership of the General Medical Council, fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the presidency of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and finally a knighthood.|$|E
5|$|Similarities that lemurs {{share with}} anthropoid primates, such as diet and social organization, {{along with their}} own unique traits, have made lemurs the most heavily studied of all mammal groups on Madagascar. Research often focuses on the link between ecology and social organization, but also on their {{behavior}} and morphophysiology (the study <b>of</b> <b>anatomy</b> in relation to function). Studies of their life-history traits, behavior and ecology help understanding of primate evolution, since they are thought to share similarities with ancestral primates.|$|E

5|$|The {{discipline}} <b>of</b> <b>anatomy</b> can be {{subdivided into}} a number of branches including gross or macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy. Gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external body features. Microscopic anatomy is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, including histology (the study of tissues), and embryology (the study of an organism in its immature condition).|$|E
5|$|The {{discipline}} <b>of</b> <b>anatomy</b> {{is divided}} into macroscopic and microscopic anatomy. Macroscopic anatomy, or gross anatomy, is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight. Gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy. Microscopic anatomy {{involves the use of}} optical instruments {{in the study of the}} tissues of various structures, known as histology, and also in the study of cells.|$|E
5|$|The history <b>of</b> <b>anatomy</b> is {{characterized}} by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers (corpses) to 20th century medical imaging techniques including X-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E

5|$|Their {{painting}} demonstrates, {{more than}} any other figures on the ceiling, Michelangelo's mastery <b>of</b> <b>anatomy</b> and foreshortening and his enormous powers of invention. In their reflection of classical antiquity they resonate with Pope Julius' aspirations to lead Italy towards a new 'age of gold'; at the same time, they staked Michelangelo's claim to greatness. However, a number of critics were angered by their presence and nudity, including Pope Adrian VI who wanted the ceiling stripped.|$|E
5|$|Human anatomy, {{physiology}} and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical {{students in their}} first year at medical school. Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems. The major anatomy textbook, Gray's Anatomy, has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods. A thorough working knowledge <b>of</b> <b>anatomy</b> is required by physicians, especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as histopathology and radiology.|$|E
5|$|Parts of Roxboro House {{date back}} to 1799. The Georgian period house {{constructed}} of frame and clapboard was expanded in 1810. At one point in its history, Roxboro House was owned by Dr. Caspar Wistar who published the first American textbook <b>of</b> <b>anatomy</b> in 1811. Wistar {{was president of the}} American Philosophical Society and his friend, Thomas Nuttall, a famous botanist, named the Wisteria vine after him. In 1965 the Philadelphia Historical Commission added this house to its list of registered buildings (No. 141). Prior to the University's purchase of the property in 1998, the house was being used as a bed and breakfast establishment.|$|E

5|$|The {{white-naped xenopsaris}} was {{described}} in 1869 by the German-Argentine scientist Hermann Burmeister, based on a specimen collected near Buenos Aires. Burmeister originally placed it in the becard genus, Pachyramphus. It {{was moved to the}} monotypic genus Xenopsaris by Robert Ridgway in 1891, but was still known to be closely related to Pachyramphus. A 1989 study <b>of</b> <b>anatomy</b> identified Pachyramphus as a sister taxon to Xenopsaris, but the white-naped xenopsaris was kept in its own genus due to several morphological and behavioural differences, namely its smaller size, the shape of its legs, the length of its primary flight feathers, the lack of strong sexual dimorphism (differences between the sexes) and the construction of the nest.|$|E
5|$|Two {{artists that}} changed the comics {{industry}} dramatically in the late 1960s were Neal Adams, considered one of his country's greatest draftsmen, and Jim Steranko. Both artists expressed a cinematic approach at times that occasionally altered the more conventional panel-based format that had been commonplace for decades. Adams' breakthrough was based on layout and rendering. Best known for returning Batman to his somber roots after the campy success of the Batman television show, his naturalistic depictions <b>of</b> <b>anatomy,</b> faces, and gestures changed comics' style {{in a way that}} Strausbaugh sees reflected in modern graphic novels.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, {{tracheotomy}} {{was considered}} the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because {{only a minority of}} patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding <b>of</b> <b>anatomy</b> and physiology, as well an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had improved the outcome of this operation {{to the point that it}} could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of anesthesiology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, and laryngology.|$|E
