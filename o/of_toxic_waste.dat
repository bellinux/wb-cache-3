25|$|After the affair, it came {{to light}} that Greenpeace had miscalculated the amount <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>waste</b> present aboard the Brent Spar. Greenpeace {{admitted}} that its claims that the Spar contained 5000 tons of oil were inaccurate, apologizing to Shell on September 5. However, Greenpeace dismissed {{the importance of the}} amount of oil on board, pointing to wider industrial responsibility as the main issue at hand, as the Brent Spar was to be the first offshore installation to be dumped in the northeast Atlantic ocean; Greenpeace claimed that it would likely have been followed by the scuttling of dozens or hundreds more platforms, setting what they consider to be a dangerous precedent. The organization went on to point out that Shell's decision to scrap the platform had been taken before Greenpeace announced the existence of an incorrect amount <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>waste,</b> and that their mistake therefore did not influence Shell's decision.|$|E

25|$|Industry also causes {{pollution}} problems. A major offender is {{the production}} of nonferrous metals. One of Tajikistan's leading industrial sites, the aluminum plant at Tursunzoda (formerly known as Regar), west of Dushanbe near the border with Uzbekistan, generates large amounts <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>waste</b> gases that have been blamed for {{a sharp increase in}} the number of birth defects among people who live within range of its emissions.|$|E

25|$|Because the United States has not {{ratified}} the Basel Convention or its Ban Amendment, and has few domestic federal laws forbidding the export <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>waste,</b> the Basel Action Network estimates that about 80% {{of the electronic}} waste directed to recycling in the U.S. does not get recycled there at all, but is put on container ships and sent to countries such as China.

25|$|Following the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004, {{there have}} emerged {{allegations}} {{that after the}} outbreak of the Somali Civil War in late 1991, Somalia's long, remote shoreline was used as a dump site for the disposal <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>waste.</b> The huge waves which battered northern Somalia after the tsunami are believed to have stirred up tonnes of nuclear and toxic waste that was illegally dumped in Somali waters by several European firms – front companies created by the Italian mafia. The European Green Party followed up these revelations by presenting before the press and the European Parliament in Strasbourg copies of contracts signed by two European companies—the Italian Swiss firm, Achair Partners, and an Italian waste broker, Progresso—and representatives of the warlords then in power, to accept 10 million tonnes <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>waste</b> in exchange for $80 million (then about £60 million). According to a report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) assessment mission, there are far higher than normal cases of respiratory infections, mouth ulcers and bleeding, abdominal hemorrhages and unusual skin infections among many inhabitants of the areas around the northeastern towns of Hobbio and Benadir on the Indian Ocean coast—diseases consistent with radiation sickness. UNEP continues that the current situation along the Somali coastline poses a very serious environmental hazard not only in Somalia but also in the eastern Africa sub-region.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{intended}} as a model planned community, Love Canal served as a residential area before being purchased by Hooker Chemical Company, now Occidental Chemical Corporation.

This event displaced numerous families, leaving them with long-standing health issues and symptoms of high {{white blood cell counts}} and leukemia. Consequently, the federal government passed the Superfund law. The resulting cleanup operation under the Superfund law demolished the neighborhood, wrapping up in 2004.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} B-movie companies of the 1980s was a survivor from the heyday of the exploitation era, Troma Pictures, founded in 1974. Troma's most characteristic productions, including Class of Nuke 'Em High (1986), Redneck Zombies (1986), and Surf Nazis Must Die (1987), take exploitation for an absurdist spin. Troma also built on another B-studio tradition: re-releasing the often embarrassing early films of actors turning into major stars. In 1986, the company acquired and distributed two unreleased films, Sizzle Beach U.S.A. (shot in 1974) and Shadows Run Black (shot in 1981), capitalizing on performances by Kevin Costner, who had recently appeared in the popular Silverado (1985) and was set to headline The Untouchables (1987). Troma's best-known production is The Toxic Avenger (1985), whose hero, after plunging into a vat <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>waste</b> while attempting to escape a loathsome gang of tormentors, mutates into a hideous creature with enhanced physical strength and revenge on what's left of his mind. After the film's successful release, the character, affectionately known as Toxie, became the symbol of Troma and an icon of the 1980s B movie. One of the few successful B-studio startups of the decade was Rome-based Empire Pictures, whose first production, Ghoulies, reached theaters in 1985. Despite other profitable ventures such as Re-Animator (1985), financial difficulties forced the company's American founder to sell it off in 1988.|$|E

25|$|Rochester is {{a leading}} private {{university}} and a major center for diverse fields of research. The university has eight Nobel Prize winners among its faculty and alumni. The university consistently ranks among the top 40 colleges and universities nationwide in federally financed science, engineering, medical, and other research, with a total research budget of around $395 million spread across many departments and research centers, including the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, a laser-based nuclear fusion facility, and the extensive research facilities at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Recently, the university has also engaged {{in a series of}} new initiatives to expand its programs in biomedical engineering and optics, including the construction of the new $37 million Robert B. Goergen Hall for Biomedical Engineering and Optics on the River Campus. Other new research initiatives include a cancer stem cell program and a Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. UR also has the ninth highest technology revenue among U.S. higher education institutions, with $46 million being paid for commercial rights to university technology and research in 2009. Notable patents include Zoloft and Gardasil. WeBWorK, a web-based system for checking homework and providing immediate feedback for students, was developed by University of Rochester professors Gage and Pizer. The system is now in use at over 800 universities and colleges, as well as several secondary and primary schools. Rochester scientists work in diverse areas; for example, physicists developed a technique for etching metal surfaces, such as platinum, titanium and brass, with powerful lasers, enabling self-cleaning surfaces that repel water droplets and will not rust if tilted at a 4 degree angle; and medical researchers are exploring how brains rid themselves <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>waste</b> during sleep.|$|E
