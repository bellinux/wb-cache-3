5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during <b>our</b> <b>stay</b> in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E
500|$|Martínez {{described}} the colors {{used in his}} creation, beginning with the yellow, which [...] "represents the sun, {{the light and the}} warmth of a welcoming place. Sun which stays in Pichilemu to make us spend beautiful moments." [...] The green color and its tones represent the [...] "forest, economic potential of the area, which augurs the countryman a promising future." [...] He {{described the}} blue color and its tones used in the coat of arms as [...] "speaking of the sea off the coast of Pichilemu, sea that is present in every moment of <b>our</b> <b>stay</b> in Pichilemu. Sea that is richness and that 'promises us a future splendor'." [...] Martínez used the red color to represent [...] "the tourism along all colors, happiness, vacations, sport," [...] while described the use of greenish gray as the [...] "touch of distinction, elegance, nobleness." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Gray was at Nootka Sound, Bodega {{provided}} {{a small house}} near his own. Gray stayed there until he left Nootka Sound. In addition, Bodega had the Columbia repaired by the Spanish caulkers, blacksmiths, and carpenters. Bodega also provided fresh food, such as vegetables and hot bread, every day. When Gray and Ingraham left, they were given large amounts of food, such as salmon, pork, eggs, butter, fresh bread, wine, brandy, and large amounts of cabbage and salad. Bodega refused any payment for any of his services. Ingraham wrote in his journal, [...] "Considering {{the part of the}} world we were in, I thought this a very handsome present. Not a day passed during <b>our</b> <b>stay</b> in this port, but every shipwithout respect to nation or personreceived marks of Don Juan's hospitality." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Come on! There is no use of <b>our</b> <b>staying</b> here longer!" [...] cried Benson, {{and led the}} {{way across}} the plain, now lit up by the {{conflagration}} beyond. He forced Potts with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to France," [...] said his sister, [...] "because Captain Horn is going there, and when he arrives, I wish {{to be there to}} meet him. There is no reason for <b>our</b> <b>staying</b> here--" ...|$|R

60|$|These days of <b>our</b> <b>stay</b> in London {{were not}} pleasant. We went about little, and enjoyed nothing. At last Pomona came to us, her face pale but determined.|$|E
60|$|But {{to return}} a little to <b>our</b> <b>stay</b> in this place, for that belongs {{to this part of}} my account, and of which I must make a few short observations.|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{is little}} sense in <b>our</b> <b>staying</b> here," [...] Mark said, bitterly. [...] "Those scoundrels don't intend {{to give us}} any show at them, and we are foolish if we remain.

6000|$|... "As <b>our</b> <b>stay</b> in the Old Homestead comes always {{during the}} summer, {{it seems a}} wilful extravagance to put our hard-earned dollars into an {{improvement}} which a renter would consider a nuisance," [...] she argued.|$|E
60|$|In this vale {{we found}} {{abundance}} of deer, and abundance {{of the same}} kind of sheep which I mentioned lately.
