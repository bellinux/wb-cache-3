5|$|At {{one point}} a {{proposal}} was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> protect the uranium in a reactor from corrosion by jacketing it with copper. The Ames Project therefore studied uranium-copper alloys, which would occur where the uranium met the copper jacket. In practice, the uranium was canned in aluminum; this too was studied, as were alloys with tin, {{which was used}} to solder the cans. Tests were also carried out with alloys of uranium with beryllium, calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and thorium, which were being produced or in use elsewhere in the Ames Project. Attempts were made to separate plutonium from uranium through metallurgy, exploiting plutonium's greater affinity with gold and silver, but the Manhattan Project chose to use the bismuth phosphate process, a chemical separation method, instead.|$|E

In May 2001, Crash and Hardcore, along with Bubba and D-Von Dudley became {{concerned}} about Molly's burgeoning relationship with Spike Dudley. This {{led to the}} Hollys-Dudleys feud intensifying, with both Spike and Molly caught in the middle. On May 28, 2001, the Dudley Boys famously put Molly through a table, with Spike lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> try and protect her. As Molly and Spike's relationship progressed, the feud between the Hollys and the Dudleys worsened.|$|E

25|$|The game {{continues}} {{in this manner}} until all the reds are potted and only the six colours are left on the table. At this point the colours must be potted in the order from least to most valuable ball– that is, yellow first (two points), then green (three points), brown (four points), blue (five points), pink (six points) and finally black (seven points), with the balls not being returned to play. When the final ball is potted, the player with more points wins. If the scores are equal when all the balls have been potted, the black is placed back on its spot as a tiebreaker. A player may also concede a frame while on strike {{if he or she}} thinks there are not enough points available <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> beat the opponent's score. In professional snooker this is a common occurrence.|$|E
25|$|The {{second part}} of the season started in early March, after nearly three months pause due to the winter break. Maribor played their first spring match in Kranj where they were {{surprisingly}} defeated by Triglav, a team {{from the bottom of the}} table. The club then faced Domžale and Mura 05 in two consecutive home matches. Maribor defeated both of them and won all six points available. They then faced their rivals Olimpija at the Stožice Stadium, where the club suffered their highest defeat of the season when they were defeated 4–1 in the seventh round. In front of 8,000 spectators Maribor pressed from the start and Velikonja scored in the sixth minute. The score did not change until early in the second half when Cvijanović increased Maribor's lead, with a superb long distance effort. During the rest of the match, which was at one point suspended for about ten minutes due to crowd trouble, Olimpija tried to make a comeback and in the 88th minute they lowered the score with a penalty shot by Dare Vršič. However, this was not enough as the time eventually ran out and Maribor won with the score 2–1. The club increased their league <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> over 20 points and it was clear that they were very close in securing their 10th title. Maribor then won their fourth consecutive match when they defeated Celje 3–1, at home. History repeated itself in early April when Maribor traveled to the Primorska region to face Koper and Gorica in two consecutive away games for the second time in the season. Similarly to the two matches in September, Maribor again only managed to win two points in Koper and Nova Gorica. The team bounced back, however, and managed to win the next seven consecutive matches, making the longest winning run of any club during the 2011–12 Slovenian PrvaLiga season. During this period Maribor scored 26 goals and conceded only four. In addition, the run included two dominant home victories over Nafta 6–0 and Triglav 8–0, and also a 3–2 victory over Olimpija. The win over Triglav in the 31st round also secured the title and Maribor became the first club in history of the PrvaLiga, who won the title with five rounds remaining.|$|E

A decision is expected shortly, so stay tuned!". Edgar Böhm, executive producer of the 2015 Eurovision Song Contest said in an interview that the BBC had been chosen to host a special anniversary show. Guy Freeman was appointed as executive producer for the event, assisted by Senior Producer Simon Proctor, the script was co-written by Edward af Sillén, Daniel Réhn and Christine Rose whilst the director was Geoff Posner.|$|E

500|$|Nonetheless, Kemper has {{continued}} to display potentially threatening behavior. [...] On one occasion, when Douglas' colleague Robert Ressler was in a cell alone with Kemper, Kemper—who at the time weighed —noticed the apprehension in Ressler after he had pressed a hidden button repeatedly to call a guard to open the cell yet not received a response and told him [...] "Relax. They're changing the shift," [...] but remarked: [...] "If I went apeshit in here, you'd be {{in a lot of}} trouble, wouldn't you? I could screw your head off and place it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> greet the guard." [...] Ressler verbally sparred with Kemper until the guard arrived, ultimately leaving unharmed with Kemper displaying no physical aggression. Kemper also stated afterwards that he was joking, but Ressler never entered a cell alone again with Kemper and it became FBI policy to interview serial killers in pairs.|$|E

2500|$|The ideal {{temperature}} for serving a particular wine {{is a matter}} of debate by wine enthusiasts and sommeliers, but some broad guidelines have emerged that will generally enhance the experience of tasting certain common wines. A white wine should foster a sense of coolness, achieved by serving at [...] "cellar temperature" [...] (...) [...] Light red wines drunk young should also be brought to the table at this temperature, where they will quickly rise a few degrees. [...] Red wines are generally perceived best when served chambré ("at room temperature"). However, this does not mean the temperature of the dining room—often around (...) —but rather the coolest room in the house and, therefore, always slightly cooler than the dining room itself. [...] Pinot noir should be brought to the table for serving at (...) and will reach its full bouquet at (...) [...] Cabernet Sauvignon, zinfandel, and Rhone varieties should be served at (...) and allowed to warm <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> [...] for best aroma.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{standard}} Set game, the dealer lays out {{cards on the}} table until either twelve are laid down or someone sees a set and calls [...] "Set!". The player who called [...] "Set" [...] takes the cards in the set, and the dealer continues to deal out cards until twelve are on the table. A player who sees a set among the twelve cards calls [...] "Set" [...] and takes the three cards, and the dealer lays three more cards <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> (<b>To</b> call out [...] "set" [...] and not pick one up quickly enough results in a penalty.) It is possible that there is no set among the twelve cards; in this case, the dealer deals out three more cards to make fifteen dealt cards, or eighteen or more, as necessary. This process of dealing by threes and finding sets continues until the deck is exhausted and there are no more sets on the table. At this point, whoever has collected the most sets wins.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to obtaining {{his record}} deal, Mika sent demos to many record {{companies}} in Britain, but was never signed. One record label in particular claimed that Mika {{had a good}} voice, but insisted he write more conventional songs like Robbie Williams {{in order to become}} more commercial. Mika rejected this advice. [...] The song [...] "Grace Kelly" [...] was inspired by these problems. In 2006 Mika signed with Island Records and began recording his debut album. His musical influences are based in classical music. Before Mika released his debut album he promised the media that [...] "It was a magical world that you could live in. A parallel universe for people that is illusory and enchanting and amazing." [...] Some songs on the album are sexually ambiguous, prompting some questioning regarding Mika's sexuality. On this, Mika comments that he has no taboos about what he can use to tell a story or what stories he can actually tell. He believes that sexualizing music is great, but politically sexualizing music and making the artist's sexuality the defining point of someone's music is [...] "boring". He says about his own sexuality: [...] "...laying myself out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> almost a tabloid level and kind of sharing my entire personal life, I'm really not into that." [...] The songs on the album have different subjects. [...] "Grace Kelly", as stated before, is about the struggle of getting a record deal. Mika stated that the song is a very important song on the album mostly because:"...it's a flagpole for the record in terms of lyrical content and the whole pop vision I wanted to get across." [...] The cover for the album and booklet was designed by Mika's sister, Yasmine, who works under the pen name DaWack, Richard Hogg and Mika himself. In March 2007 the album was released in the United States. Before its release there was much publicity about the album, mainly due to its success in Europe. Mika commented on the hype by saying: [...] "I think I'm lucky. Hype can be good and hype can be bad. The good thing that's happening to me is that the hype is about the project, it's about the music ... I'm not the son of anyone famous, I haven't really slept with anyone particularly well known ... it's really just about music, and that's something I think is very healthy." ...|$|E
