5000|$|In March 1987 she was {{decommissioned}} {{and entered}} Colonnas Shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia for her MMA (see above for {{details of the}} conversion). Courageous was returned to the Coast Guard on 5 March 1990 in Portsmouth, Virginia. The cutter was then placed in commission [...] "special status." [...] Following an extensive <b>onload</b> <b>of</b> needed supplies, the crew completed a five-month engine overhaul in Portsmouth. During subsequent engine trials, a shaft alignment problem was discovered by the crew. A five-month drydocking at the Coast Guard Yard for shaft repairs was required. In addition to shaft repairs, a new steering motor was installed, both anchors were replaced, and a new computer system was installed in the cutters combat information center. Having completed the repairs to the shaft alignment and undergoing extensive crew training and ready for sea preparations, Courageous arrived at its new homeport of Panama City, Florida, on 3 February 1991. She was formally recommissioned on 16 March 1991.|$|R

In {{order to}} explore the {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> waiting time in high-speed rail hub, this paper analyzed the influencing factors <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> waiting time, based on the survey <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> waiting time in high-speed rail hub. And the main influencing factors were screened out using variance analysis. Then the prediction model <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> waiting time based on BP neural network was established, {{the parameters of the}} model were calibrated and the validity was verified. The results show that, travel time in urban area, trip distance, familiarity toward the hub, educational background <b>of</b> <b>passengers,</b> and the type of transportation is the main influencing factor <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> waiting time in high-speed rail hub, and the average relative error is only 9. 2 % using the proposed prediction model <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> waiting time based on BP neural network...|$|R

3000|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>{{passengers}}</b> ‘n’ {{changes on}} the walkway over the time. As the number <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> on the walkway increases, the slower passengers block faster passengers. Thus, higher passenger densities reduce the individual passenger walking speed. The speed is reduced to 0 when the number <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> ‘n’ reaches to the capacity of walkway ‘C = 5 LW’. The passenger flow on the walkway {{can be viewed as}} stopped when the density <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> is 5  ped/m 2. [35]. The walking speed variation phenomenon with an increase or decrease in the number <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> ‘n’ on the walkway is known as state dependence. Hence, the walkway can be described as a state-dependent queuing system with passenger arrival rate represented by A, state-dependent service rate of the walkway by B([...] n [...]) and the number of servers (available positions/spaces) C to accommodate the maximum C number <b>of</b> <b>passengers,</b> i.e., A/B(n)/C/C queuing system.|$|R
