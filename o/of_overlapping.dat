5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with clinker (or clench) planking, a technique where the hull consisted <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> planks that bore the structural strength of the ship.

Later examination indicates that the clinker planking is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping planking, though not with a true clinker technique.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, German {{mathematician}} Petra Gummelt {{demonstrated that}} a covering (so called to {{distinguish it from}} a non-overlapping tiling) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> regions are allowed. The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches, and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose (P2) tiling.

Shortly afterwards, the band purchased what was reported as several thousand dollars worth of stolen strobe lights at a bargain rate, and their visual equipment soon took up more space than their instruments. Smoke machines were later added. Equally memorable was the band's propensity for projecting a variety of films behind them as they played, beginning with one 16-millimeter projector, before adding others. This set-up allowed them to play a number <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> movies {{at the same time}} which were often strangely angled, upside down or played in reverse.

40|$|In {{the real}} world, {{problems}} with overlapping sub-problems are common. In these problems, confliction between sub-problems are common. To study confliction between sub-problems, overlapping {{need to be}} studied first. To study overlapping, test functions with full control-lability over overlapping are needed. With full controllability over overlapping, experiments can be implemented on desired extent <b>of</b> <b>overlaps,</b> and effects <b>of</b> <b>overlaps</b> can be precisely estimated and separated while confliction is being studied. However, existing test functions does not satisfy the requirement. In this paper, a test function with full controllability over overlapping is proposed. Four crossover methods capable of solving problems with overlaps are used and compared to study overlapping and confliction. Results show that the problem difficulties to these crossover methods exponentially increases with the extent <b>of</b> <b>overlaps,</b> {{and the effect of}} confliction decades while the extent <b>of</b> <b>overlaps</b> increases. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{result of}} {{different}} missions {{and forms of}} conversion was a series <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> and informally organised churches. In the past historians used the term Celtic Church to describe a specific form of Christianity with its origins in the conversion of Ireland, traditionally associated with St. Patrick and which later spread to northern Britain through Iona. It is also used as a general description for the Christian establishment of northern Britain prior to the twelfth century, when new religious institutions and ideologies of primarily French origin began to take root in Scotland. The Celtic form of Christianity has been contrasted with that derived from missions from Rome, which reached southern England in 587 {{under the leadership of}} St. Augustine of Canterbury. Subsequent missions from Canterbury then helped convert the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, reaching Northumbria in the early eighth century, where Iona had already begun to have a presence. As a result, Christianity in Northumbria became a mix of Celtic and Roman influences.|$|E

5|$|When two proteins' {{distance}} matrices {{share the}} same or similar features in approximately the same positions, they {{can be said to}} have similar folds with similar-length loops connecting their secondary structure elements. DALI's actual alignment process requires a similarity search after the two proteins' distance matrices are built; this is normally conducted via a series <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> submatrices of size 6x6. Submatrix matches are then reassembled into a final alignment via a standard score-maximization algorithm— the original version of DALI used a Monte Carlo simulation to maximize a structural similarity score that {{is a function of the}} distances between putative corresponding atoms. In particular, more distant atoms within corresponding features are exponentially downweighted to reduce the effects of noise introduced by loop mobility, helix torsions, and other minor structural variations. Because DALI relies on an all-to-all distance matrix, it can account for the possibility that structurally aligned features might appear in different orders within the two sequences being compared.|$|E

5|$|The Greek {{style of}} warfare had been honed over the {{preceding}} centuries.

The hoplite was, {{by the standards of}} the time, heavily armoured, with a breastplate (originally bronze, but probably by this stage a more flexible leather version), greaves, a full helmet, and a large round shield (the aspis). Hoplites were armed with a long spear (the doru), which was evidently significantly longer than Persian spears, and a sword (the xiphos). Hoplites fought in the phalanx formation; the exact details are not completely clear, but it was a close-knit formation, presenting a uniform front <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> shields, and spears, to the enemy. Properly assembled, the phalanx was a formidable offensive and defensive weapon; on occasions when it is recorded to have happened, it took a huge number of light infantry to defeat a relatively small phalanx. The phalanx was vulnerable to being outflanked by cavalry, if caught on the wrong terrain, however. The hoplite's heavy armour and long spears made them excellent troops in hand-to-hand combat and gave them significant protection against ranged attacks by light troops and skirmishers. Even if the shield did not stop a missile, there was a reasonable chance the armour would.|$|E
