5|$|Synchronous {{spawning}} is very typical on {{the coral}} reef, and often, even when multiple species are present, all corals spawn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>night.</b> This synchrony is essential so {{male and female}} gametes can meet. Corals rely on environmental cues, varying from species to species, to determine the proper time to release gametes into the water. The cues involve temperature change, lunar cycle, day length, and possibly chemical signalling. Synchronous spawning may form hybrids and is perhaps involved in coral speciation. The immediate cue is most often sunset, which cues the release. The spawning event can be visually dramatic, clouding the usually clear water with gametes.|$|E
