50|$|Another {{significant}} {{feature of}} Figure 2 is the distinct colour change between surface sediments and those deeper. This gradient of colour change, though continuous, {{is known as}} the apparent redox potential discontinuity depth (ARPD) when reduced to an average transition point. When properly considered in conjunction with local geology and bioturbation levels, the depth and character of the ARPD can provide profound insights into the interactions between sediment geochemistry and biologic activity. Graf’s review (1992) supports the early observations of Jorgensen & Fenchel (1970) that sediments can be divided into oxic, suboxic, and anoxic levels with fundamental consequences for biota. They defined these boundaries as occurring at the >300 mV (<b>oxidation</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>potential)</b> level for oxic and less than 100 mV for anoxic chemoclines (with suboxic in between) as presented in Figure 3. The vertical position of these boundaries can vary seasonally and locally in response to detrital supply and mixing (due to bioturbation or physically mediated mixing) as fast as 1 cm d-1. Anoxic sediments tend to be toxic to most animals because of free H2S and low pH. In this reducing environment, heavy metals can also precipitate. Some heavy metals, like cadmium and copper, are stabilised as sulphides and do not readily dissolve, but can be remobilised quickly and pollute boundary layer water if oxic conditions are restored (Graf 1992). The sediment penetration of chemical species from overlying waters to these layers will depend heavily upon {{the size and shape of}} sediment grains. Using a fluid bromide tracer, Dicke (in Graf 1992) found molecular diffusion alone to penetrate soft sediments to 4 cm in one day and 8 cm after 4 days. Bioturbation can accelerate this process by up to a factor of ten. Thus, the chemoclines affect and are, in turn, affected by benthic organisms. Besides exclusion and bioturbation effects of aerobic organisms, Fenchel and Riedl (1970) pioneered investigations into an unusual fauna inhabiting the suboxic regions of sediment. Clearly, SPI tools have much to offer in investigations of this sort.|$|E

This indicates that a 3 -hydroxypyridine ring is very difficult to be reduced or oxidized. The reducibility of pyridinoline with a reducing agent, sodium borohydride, was also studied. It was not reduced by the reagent, however, it was found to be decomposed by light during the treatment. These results indicate that pyridinoline is a so-called "non-reducible " crosslink. Several crosslinks of collagen have been isolated and identified, most of which are in the unstable Schiff base form (/). They can be isolated only after reduction with sodium borohydride (NaBH*), so they are called reducible crosslinks. The con-tents of these reducible crosslinks rather decrease with age, although the collagen fiber steadily in-creases in stability with age.
