The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On the right is Saint Christopher, carrying the Christ child on his shoulders, who raises his hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his presence here.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—As {{society has}} become {{increasingly}} reliant upon digital images to communicate visual information, <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> forensic techniques {{have been developed to}} verify the authenticity of digital images. Amongst the most successful of these are techniques that make use <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>image’s</b> compression history and its associated compression fingerprints. Little consideration has been given, however, to anti-forensic techniques capable of fooling forensic algorithms. In this paper, we present <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> anti-forensic techniques designed to remove forensically significant indicators <b>of</b> compression from <b>an</b> <b>image.</b> We do this by first developing a generalized framework for the design of anti-forensic techniques to remove compression fingerprints from <b>an</b> <b>image’s</b> transform coefficients. This framework operates by estimating the distribution <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>image’s</b> transform coefficients before compression, then adding anti-forensic dither to the transform coefficients <b>of</b> <b>a</b> compressed <b>image</b> so that their distribution matches the estimated one. We then use this framework to develop anti-forensic techniques specifically targeted at erasing compression fingerprints left by both JPEG and wavelet-based coders. Additionally, we propose a technique to remove statistical traces of the blocking artifacts left by image compression algorithms that divide <b>an</b> <b>image</b> into segments during processing. Through <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> experiments, we demonstrate that our anti-forensic techniques are capable of removing forensically detectable traces of image compression without significantly impacting <b>an</b> <b>image’s</b> visual quality. Furthermore, we show how these techniques can be used to render several forms of image tampering such as double JPEG compression, cut-and-paste image forgery, and image origin falsification undetectable through compression-history-based forensic means.

25|$|A {{high-level}} representation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> necessarily {{contains elements}} in a different domain from pixels. These elements {{are referred to as}} primitives. In a schematic drawing, for instance, line segments and curves might be primitives. In a graphical user interface, windows and buttons might be the primitives. In 3D rendering, triangles and polygons in space might be primitives.|$|E
25|$|Gaussian {{blurring}} {{is commonly}} used when reducing the size <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>image.</b> When downsampling an image, {{it is common to}} apply a low-pass filter to the image prior to resampling. This is to ensure that spurious high-frequency information does not appear in the downsampled image (aliasing). Gaussian blurs have nice properties, such as having no sharp edges, and thus do not introduce ringing into the filtered image.|$|E
25|$|Besides the camera, {{other methods}} of forming images with light are available. For instance, a {{photocopy}} or xerography machine forms permanent images but uses {{the transfer of}} static electrical charges rather than photographic medium, hence the term electrophotography. Photograms are images produced by the shadows of objects cast on the photographic paper, {{without the use of}} a camera. Objects can also be placed directly on the glass <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> scanner to produce digital pictures.|$|E
