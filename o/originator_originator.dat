40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel Fair Gradual Secrete Release (GSR) {{protocol}} for E-contract signing against earnest money between an <b>originator</b> and a responder involving their banks as transacting parties. We provide a security analysis of the protocol and analyze some important and pertinent properties of the protocol, which include money atomicity, validated contract and the fairness in true sense. The protocol involves <b>originator,</b> <b>originator’s</b> bank, responder, responder’s bank as transacting parties without using an additional trusted third party. We also formally prove the existence of all the said properties. Key words...|$|R

The goal of this project is to make the current licensing process more efficient so that the Division can handle the increased workload without having to hire additional personnel...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model that helps explain several past collapses of {{securitization}} markets. <b>Originators</b> issue too many informationally insensitive securities in good times, blunting investor incentives to become informed. The resulting endogenous scarcity of informed investors exacerbates primary market collapses in bad times. Ine ¢ ciency arises because informed investors are a public good {{from the perspective of}} <b>originators.</b> All <b>originators</b> bene t from the presence of additional informed investors in bad times, but each <b>originator</b> minimizes his reliance on costly informed capital in good times by issuing safe securities. Our model suggests regulations that limit the issuance of safe securities in good times. We are grateful to David Scharfstein and Jeremy Stein for their guidance throughout this project.

30|$|DSR {{protocol}} is a {{routing protocol}} for MANET where no infrastructure is required. The multihop nature in DSR enables nodes to forward packets to neighboring nodes when the nodes {{are within the}} transmission range. The <b>originator</b> (sender) of the data initiates route discovery whenever {{the location of the}} destined receiver is not known. The route discovery packet, i.e., route request (RREQ), is flooded. Upon reaching every node, each node can read the packet information such as sender address, destination address, and request ID determined by the <b>originator.</b> Further, each node appends its identity when forwarding RREQ to the next nodes. Once the information has reached the target node, it sends a route replay message to the <b>originator.</b> Further, the entire route recorded in the RREQ packet is copied to route reply (RREP) and forwarded back to the <b>originator.</b> The <b>originator</b> upon receiving this information caches the route for subsequent routing. The intermediate nodes discard any packet when the packet contains the same ID that it has seen before or it finds its address in the recorded route; otherwise, it appends its address to route record in the RREQ packet [24, 25].|$|R
30|$|The {{process to}} {{evaluate}} the dissolution behavior of generic products also revealed some quality-related issues in off-patented <b>originator</b> products. An <b>originator</b> diazepam product, which marketing authorization was transferred from another company, showed changes in the dissolution behaviors from those obtained in the QRED program. Reviewing the granulation and compression process resulted in the dissolution profiles close {{to those in the}} QRED program. Another company improved manufacturing control of bezafibrate SR tablet product to reduce variation in the dissolution profiles within batches, after the Committee found the dissolution was close to its specification. An itraconazole capsule product showed large variation in dissolution (see below). These findings confirmed the importance of the product quality control throughout the product lifecycle, including technology transfer after patent expiration.|$|R
40|$|We present {{mobile agent}} abstractions {{in terms of}} a few basic {{mobility}} and connec-tivity features. The features used in formulating the abstractions are identied as self-hopping, push by host, retraction by <b>originator,</b> push by <b>originator,</b> and mobility and disconnection of host machines. Combining these primitives leads to dierent agent abstractions with varying avors of mobility and interaction with hosts. Six such abstractions namely Autonomous Agent, Messenger Agent, Controlled Agent, Greedy Agent, Phoenix Agent and Disconnected Agent are presented. A unique feature of this work is that the abstractions themselves are described in the more general Ambient Calculus. Ambient descriptions bring out the subtle dierences between structural and behavioral properties of the agent abstractions. Guidelines for mapping the abstractions to an implementation over a mobility framework are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} {{the scope of the}} <b>originator</b> and the <b>originator's</b> bank's rights, duties and {{liabilities}} for fraudulent international wholesale EFT under English law, is unpredictable and uncertain.;The argument relies on analysing the law applying to fraudulent international wholesale EFT in England. This includes the general principles of contract law, agency law and the rules which apply to forged cheques, and the UK Cross-Border Credit Transfer Regulations 1999 which implemented the EU Directive on Cross-Border Credit Transfers 1997. The English law is then compared with Article 4 A of the U. S. Uniform Commercial Code 1989 and the UNCITRAL Model Law in International Credit Transfer 1992.;Chapter one defines EFT, and demonstrates the legal concept of fraudulent EFT in English law. This chapter focuses on the significance of authority and the problem of identity authentication under English common law. Chapter two analyses the legal nature of payment orders and the rules applying to fraudulent EFT in English and EU law. Moreover, it examines the forms and legal validity of security procedures in the context of EFT in English and EU law. Chapter three discusses the rules of the UNCITRAL Model Law and Article 4 A as applied to unauthorised EFT. It focuses on the legal concept and validity of security procedures under both legal frameworks. Chapter four deals with the basis of the <b>originator's</b> action against the <b>originator's</b> bank for fraudulent EFT in English law. Chapter five considers the basis of action and freedom of contract under the UNCITRAL Model Law and Article 4 A. Chapter five examines the scope of the <b>originator's</b> bank's liabilities for direct and consequential damages occurring as a result of fraudulent EFT under both legal frameworks...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2011. This study {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of generic medicine competition on the market share growth and pricing of <b>originator</b> brand medicine in the South African private pharmaceutical market. The study is based on five years (2005 to 2011) of IMS Health market share data for 39 <b>originator</b> brand drugs that {{have been exposed to}} competition from generic substitutes from 2001. The results show that, for all the drug molecules included in the study pooled together, the price of an <b>originator</b> brand medicine relative to the weighted average price of its generics has a significant negative impact on the change of its market share. Results for the molecules pooled according to anatomical classes, as well as each molecule separately, show that in four out of the nine classes represented in the study and nine out of the 39 molecules the relative price of the <b>originator</b> brand medicine had a significant negative impact on its change in market share. The manufacturers and marketers of generic medicines would be well advised to offer their medicines at significantly discounted prices compared to the <b>originator</b> brands, as the results suggest that the market penetration of the generic product may depend heavily on the price the generics are offered at. Investigations into the prices of the <b>originator</b> brands in relation with the number of generic equivalents in the market show that the number of generics available in a specific market has a significant positive impact on the relative price of <b>originators,</b> thereby making <b>originators</b> relatively more expensive compared with their generic competitors, {{while at the same time}} the results show that the absolute price of the <b>originator</b> brand medicines declines as the number of generic equivalents in the market increases. This indicates that, from a policy perspective, reducing the barriers to entry for generic medicine once <b>originator</b> patents expire may have a significant role to play in reducing the cost of pharmaceutical drugs in the South African market...|$|R
