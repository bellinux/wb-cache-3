5|$|A male {{sea otter}} {{is most likely}} to mate if he {{maintains}} a breeding territory in an area that is also favored by females. As autumn is the peak breeding season in most areas, males typically defend their territory <b>only</b> <b>from</b> spring to autumn. During this time, males patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other males, although actual fighting is rare. Adult females move freely between male territories, where they outnumber adult males by an average of five to one. Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.|$|E

5|$|According to {{customary}} law, noblemen {{could not}} be sued outside the province until the 15thcentury.

Litigants could appeal to the royal court against the decision of the voivode from the 14thcentury, but the voivode often remained involved in the proceedings.

5|$|Additional subfamilies {{have been}} named for more fragmentary genera, {{including}} Aublysodontinae and Deinodontinae. However, the genera Aublysodon and Deinodon are usually considered nomina dubia, so they and their eponymous subfamilies are usually excluded from taxonomies of tyrannosaurids. An additional tyrannosaurid, Raptorex, was initially described as a more primitive tyrannosauroid, but likely represents a juvenile tyrannosaurine similar to Tarbosaurus. However, {{as it is known}} <b>only</b> <b>from</b> a juvenile specimen, it is also currently considered a nomen dubium.|$|E
5|$|Adenanthos obovatus hybridises with A.detmoldii {{to produce}} A.× pamela. Known <b>only</b> <b>from</b> road verges in the Scott River region, {{it was first}} {{discovered}} in 1979, {{and it is now}} known from more than twenty individual plants. The discovery of it in such large numbers, together with its recognised horticultural potential, prompted Nelson to formally describe and name it in 1986. Morphologically it is intermediate between its parents; that is, taller than A.obovatus, with longer leaves and light red flowers. It is fertile, raising the possibility of the establishment of a hybrid swarm.|$|E
