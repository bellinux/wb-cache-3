40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was {{to find out which}} impacts of the {{parametric}} changes, linked to the change of law no. 155 / 1995 Sb. about pension insurance, as amended, affected the number of applications for early retirement in the Jindřichův Hradec district. The need to solve this problem arose from the questioning of Section 15 of act no. 155 / 1995 Sb., as amended, regarding social insurance, which governs the assignment of the calculation basis used to work out the percentual pension allowance. The Constitutional Court concluded that the defined rules generate significant differences between the amount paid into the insurance system and the amount of the <b>old-age</b> <b>benefit</b> received. On this basis the MPSV (Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs) compiled the rule changes for calculation of <b>old-age</b> <b>benefit</b> and together with the other parametric changes prepared, this was proposed as the so-called ?minor pension reform?. The proposal passed through the legislative process and with effect from 30 th September 2011 the rules for the calculation of the <b>old-age</b> <b>benefit</b> changed according to the new Act (no. 220 / 2011 Sb.) that amends Act no. 155 / 1995 Sb. on social insurance, as amended by subsequent rules, and several other Acts. The new regulations favour citizens with higher incomes. For persons with a lower income the change resulted in lower pensions received, as a result of which some have chosen to apply for early retirement. The {{aim of this}} thesis was to survey applications for all types of retirement in the years 2010 and 2011 with emphasis on the number of applications for early retirement in the district of J. Hradec and to analyse the length of prematurity at the time the application for early retirement was submitted. The comparison periods were the months from March to September of the respective years. Based on the given aims, quantitative research was chosen as the method of standardised research and two hypotheses were tested: 1. As a consequence of the changes in the regulations for the benefit calculation the number of early retirement applications has risen. 2. The highest interest in allowance of early retirement was shown by citizens with a maximum of 1 year left before reaching the age limit at which they were entitled to <b>old-age</b> pension <b>benefits.</b> The research was carried out by content and secondary analysis of data contained in the official statistics of ČSSZ (Czech Social Security Administration) and OSSZ (District Social Security Administration) and other available materials for the years 2010 and 2011. After analysis and evaluation of the required information the first defined hypothesis was confirmed; citizens were choosing early retirement regardless {{of the fact that the}} percentual assessment of the calculation basis would be reduced for every 90 days before retirement age, but were able to retain their original pension calculation basis. They were making this decision despite the fact that by reduction of the received <b>old-age</b> <b>benefit</b> their pension was lowered by approximately 12 %. In this case, providing they satisfied the legal condition of insurance duration, they used the opportunity to retire before reaching the age limit for old-age pension, which meant 3 years early. In the final phase it was confirmed that in the tracked period applications from citizens with up to 1 year left to reach the retirement age did not predominate. The number of applicants retiring 3 years earlier was approximately the same as those with one year left. There were slightly fewer citizens with two years left to satisfy the legal condition of the insurance duration. In the conclusion of the results section, data are also mentioned which evidence the number of state pensions being paid and the expenses used for these benefits from the national budget. This is quite a considerable amount and it continues to rise with the number of pensions being paid...|$|R

The former version of the challenged statute operated directly to compensate women for past economic discrimination and was deliberately enacted to compensate women for the particular economic disabilities they suffered. The subsequent amendment of § 415 was not a Congressional admission that its previous policy was invidiously discriminatory. The retired male worker's Fifth Amendment rights were not violated by the prospective application of § 415, as the Constitution did not forbid statutory changes to have a beginning and thus to discriminate between the rights of an earlier and later time.|$|R
