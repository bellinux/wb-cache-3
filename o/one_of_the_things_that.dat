5|$|Coker {{grew up in}} Linden, New Jersey {{and became}} an Eagle Scout in Troop 32 of Saint Elizabeth's Catholic Church in Linden on January 27, 1959. He has stated that his passion for Scouting is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> got him through his 6.5years as a POW in North Vietnam, {{to the point that}} at times all he could {{remember}} was the Scout Oath, but not the names of his family members.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Spector {{wanted to}} achieve in Deus Ex was to make JC Denton a cipher for the player, {{in order to create}} a better {{immersion}} and gameplay experience. He did not want the character to force any emotion so that whatever feelings the player may be experiencing comes from themselves rather than from JC Denton. To do this, Spector instructed voice actor Jay Anthony Franke to record his dialogue without any emotion but in a monotone voice, which is unusual for a voice acting role.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen {{was born}} in Tønsberg, Norway, on 30 November 1990, to Sigrun Øen, a {{chemical}} engineer and Henrik Albert Carlsen, an IT consultant. The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum. Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age: at two years, he could solve 50-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10–14. His father taught him to play chess {{at the age of}} 5, although he initially showed little interest in the game. He has three sisters, and in 2010 he stated that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> first motivated him to take up chess seriously was the desire to beat his elder sister at the game.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights of the Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried {{to learn as much}} about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> made Knights of the Old Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E
5|$|The {{justification}} for the closure of Loring was that the Air Force had six more strategic bases than were needed to support the number of bomber and tanker aircraft in the Defense Department's Structure Plan. The base was evaluated against eight selection criteria {{and a large number}} of subelements specific to Air Force bases and missions. Even though Loring was in good condition and had strong community support, it ranked low in the criteria when compared to twenty other bases in the strategic category. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> hurt Loring was its limited peacetime value as a tanker base, as well as its distance from bombing ranges. The commission did note that the facilities at Loring were above average, and the cost to close Loring would be low, the latter of which contributed to its closure.|$|E

25|$|This is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{really make}} the race interesting. Because each team only has two bikes and four members, each member must perform {{at least one}} {{exchange}} {{during the course of}} the race.

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{cause the}} most {{confusion}} {{for people that}} {{are not familiar with}} the game are the Holding the Ball, Dropping the Ball, and Throwing rules. Confusion arises because a player being tackled is not allowed to hold onto the ball, but is not allowed to throw it either.|$|E

25|$|The Tale was {{originally}} published in 1704 by John Nutt. Swift had used Benjamin Tooke previously when publishing for Sir William Temple. He would use Tooke for both the fifth edition of the Tale (1710) and later works. Tooke's successor, Benjamin Motte, published Swift's Gulliver's Travels. This difference in printer is only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> led to debate over authorship of the work.|$|E
25|$|The Hebrew word mashiach (or moshiach), anglicized to messiah, means anointed, {{a meaning}} {{preserved}} in the English word derived from it, messiah. The Messiah {{is to be a}} human leader, physically descended from the Davidic line, who will rule and unite the people of Israel and will usher in the Messianic Age of global and universal peace. While the name of Jewish Messiah is considered to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> precede creation, he is not considered divine, in contrast to Christianity where Jesus is both divine and the Messiah.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson had {{originally}} {{decided that the}} University of Virginia would have no president. Rather, this power was to be shared by a rector and a Board of Visitors. But as the 19th century waned, it became obvious this cumbersome arrangement was incapable of adequately handling the many administrative and fundraising tasks of the growing university. Edwin Alderman, who had only recently moved from his post as president of UNC-Chapel Hill since 1896 {{to become president of}} Tulane University in 1900, accepted an offer as president of the University of Virginia in 1904. His appointment was not without controversy, and national media such as Popular Science lamented the end of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> made UVA unique among universities.|$|E
25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, {{but they were all}} good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky {{and then all of a}} sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E
25|$|In late 2006 AAA owner Antonio Peña died, forcing various changes {{backstage}} including Joaquin Roldan {{taking over}} the booking duties. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Roldan changed in AAA was that La Parka was no longer booked as the lone top tecnico any more, focusing the main storyline more on Cibernético. On March 18, 2007 La Parka won his fourth and so far final Rey de Reyes tournament defeating Octagón, Abismo Negro, Rhino, Fuerza Guerrera and Latin Lover in the elimination match final. At Triplemania XV the La Legión team of Ron Killings, Sabu, Head Hunter A and Rikishi Phatu defeated La Parka, El Zorro, Latin Lover and Animal. Over the summer of 2007 La Parka injured his shoulder in a car accident, forcing him to work a lighter schedule and a less risky style. At the 2007 Antonio Peña Memorial Show Kenzo Suzuki aggravated La Parka's injury by accident forcing him {{to take time off}} after the event.|$|E

500|$|One of the [...] "complicated {{realistic}} elements" [...] of Yukari's {{character was}} {{her sense of}} purity that only her voice could convey. Though it took days of listening to the audition tapes, Shinkai finally chose Kana Hanazawa, who had a very low natural voice, despite typically playing the roles of high-pitched younger girls. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> impressed Shinkai about Hanazawa's voice was her ability to cover such {{a broad range of}} expression.|$|E
500|$|Following a {{high school}} ski trip {{when he was in}} year 11, Mayberry {{contracted}} meningococcal disease at the age of 16, and this resulted in double below the knee amputations.

500|$|The {{score was}} {{positively}} received by critics.

Derek Germano of The Cinema Laser wrote that [...] "Walker's creepy musical score is really a winner, and is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> will help to make Final Destination a minor genre classic a few years down the road".|$|E

50|$|The {{film has}} the tag-line, “Fighting poverty is big business, but who profits <b>the</b> most?” <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>the</b> film looks at is {{charitable}} institutions {{and their role}} in fighting poverty. It questions whether aid institutions themselves are sometimes a hindrance to fighting poverty. The film features Herman Chinery-Hesse, Hernando de Soto and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mohammad Yunus. Also featured in the film are Bill Clinton and Bono.|$|R
