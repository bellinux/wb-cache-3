5|$|Following the cliffhanger of the {{previous}} episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith), his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), River Song, and Father Octavian (Iain Glen) and his militarised clerics have escaped entrapment by the Weeping Angels, creatures who only move when unobserved by others. They take refuge inside the crashed starship Byzantium, but the Angels pursue them and Amy is on the brink <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> the imprint of an Angel in her eye. Both the Angels and the Doctor's team face danger from a widening crack {{in space and time}} which has the power to erase persons from history.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the drummer}} landed several acting roles. His first was in 1971, a cameo in Frank Zappa's 200 Motels as a nun afraid <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> a drug overdose. Although {{it only took}} 13 days to film, fellow cast member Howard Kaylan remembers Moon {{spending}} off-camera time at the Kensington Garden Hotel bar instead of sleeping. Moon's next film role was J.D. Clover, drummer for the fictional Stray Cats at a holiday camp during {{the early days of}} British rock 'n' roll, in 1973's That'll Be the Day. He reprised the role for the film's 1974 sequel, Stardust, and played Uncle Ernie in Ken Russell's 1975 film adaptation of Tommy. Moon's last film appearance was in 1978's Sextette with Starr and Alice Cooper. This was the last film to star Mae West.|$|E
5|$|Regarding incidence, cohort {{longitudinal}} studies (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, {{which means that}} half of new dementia cases each year are AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every {{five years after the}} age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. The risk <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> Alzheimer's disease is 26% higher among the non-Hispanic white population than among the non-Hispanic black population, whereas the Hispanic population has a 30% lower risk than the non-Hispanic white population.|$|E

25|$|Smoking {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{preventable}} death globally. In the United States about 500,000 deaths per year are attributed to smoking-related diseases and a recent study estimated that as much as 1/3 of China's male population will have significantly shortened life-spans due to smoking. Male and female smokers lose an average of 13.2 and 14.5 years of life, respectively. At least half of all lifelong smokers die earlier as a result of smoking. The risk <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> lung cancer before age 85 is 22.1% for a male smoker and 11.9% for a female current smoker, in the absence of competing causes of death. The corresponding estimates for lifelong nonsmokers are a 1.1% probability <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> lung cancer before age 85 for a man of European descent, and a 0.8% probability for a woman. Smoking one cigarette a day results in a risk of heart disease that is halfway between that of a smoker and a non-smoker. The non-linear dose response relationship may be explained by smoking's effect on platelet aggregation.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{exposure}} to ozone {{has been shown}} to increase risk of death from respiratory illness.

25|$|Bacon is {{considered}} by many doctors to be unhealthy if eaten in excess. A study conducted by researchers at the University of Zurich found a connection between eating processed meat and the risk <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> heart disease or cancer. Processed meats contain preservatives known as nitrates that, when absorbed by the human body, convert into nitrosamine, a chemical compound that could cause cancer. A second study by researchers at Columbia University found that the consumption of cured meats increase a person's chances of developing chronic pulmonary disease.|$|E
25|$|Diabetes and prediabetes are {{strongly}} linked to obesity and overweight. Nearly 50% {{of people with}} diabetes are obese, and 90% are overweight. 19 A chief risk factor for prediabetes is excess abdominal fat. Obesity increases one’s risk {{for a variety of}} other medical problems, including hypertension, stroke, other forms of cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and several forms of cancer. Obese individuals are at twice the risk <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> any cause than normal-weight individuals. The prevalence of obesity and overweight have risen to epidemic proportions in the United States, where 67% of adults are overweight and, of these, approximately half are obese.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{the land}} became {{somewhat}} less arid, {{and the risk}} <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> thirst started to abate. Other difficulties continued, however: the team had to abandon more of their horses, and {{one member of the}} team suffered from scurvy and could barely walk. The team finally sighted the telegraph line near Mount Alexander on 27 September and reached Peake Telegraph Station three days later. The remainder of the journey was a succession of triumphant public receptions by passing through each country town en route to Adelaide. The team reached Adelaide on 3 November 1874, more than six months after they started from Geraldton.|$|E

Furthermore, UV-A rays from sunlight are believed to interact with folic acid in ways that may damage health. In a number of traditional societies the sun was avoided as much as possible, especially around noon when the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight is at its most intense.

25|$|At last, {{the missing}} Collins enters the apartment, {{presenting}} Angel, {{who is now}} in full drag and shares the money she made and the amusing story of how she killed a dog to earn it ("Today 4 U"). Benny arrives, speaking of Maureen's upcoming protest against his plans to evict the homeless from a lot where he is hoping to build a cyber arts studio. Benny offers that, if they convince Maureen to cancel the protest, then Mark and Roger can officially remain rent-free tenants. However, the two rebuff Benny's offer and he leaves ("You'll See"). Mark must leave to fix Maureen's sound equipment for the protest, but he unexpectedly meets Joanne at the stage. They overcome their awkwardness by connecting over their shared distrust of Maureen's promiscuous behaviors ("Tango: Maureen"). Mark joins Collins and Angel to film their HIV support group meeting ("Life Support"), while Mimi attempts to seduce Roger alone in his apartment ("Out Tonight"). Roger is clearly upset by Mimi's intrusion and he demands she leave him alone ("Another Day"). After Mimi leaves, Roger reflects on his fear <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> AIDS, while the Life Support group echoes his thoughts ("Will I?").|$|E
25|$|Like {{other forms}} of smoking, cigar smoking poses a {{significant}} health risk depending on dosage: risks are greater for those who inhale more when they smoke, smoke more cigars, or smoke them longer. The risk <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> any cause is significantly greater for cigar smokers, with the risk particularly higher for smokers less than 65 years old, and with risk for moderate and deep inhalers reaching levels similar to cigarette smokers. The increased risk for those smoking 1–2 cigars per day {{is too small to}} be statistically significant, and the health risks of the 3/4 of cigar smokers who smoke less than daily are not known and are hard to measure. Although it has been claimed that people who smoke few cigars have no increased risk, a more accurate statement is that their risks are proportionate to their exposure. Health risks are similar to cigarette smoking in nicotine addiction, periodontal health, tooth loss, and many types of cancer, including cancers of the mouth, throat, and esophagus. Cigar smoking also can cause cancers of the lung and larynx, where the increased risk is less than that of cigarettes. Many of these cancers have extremely low cure rates. Cigar smoking also increases the risk of lung and heart diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} {{socioeconomic}} factor of health disparities, race is another key factor. The United States historically had large disparities {{in health and}} access to adequate healthcare between races, and current evidence supports the notion that these racially centered disparities continue to exist and are a significant social health issue. The disparities in access to adequate healthcare include differences {{in the quality of}} care based on race and overall insurance coverage based on race. A 2002 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association identifies race as a significant determinant in the level of quality of care, with blacks receiving lower quality care than their white counterparts. This is in part because members of ethnic minorities such as African Americans are either earning low incomes, or living below the poverty line. In a 2007 Census Bureau, African American families made an average of $33,916, while their white counterparts made an average of $54,920. Due to a lack of affordable health care, the African American death rate reveals that African Americans have a higher rate <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> treatable or preventable causes. According to a study conducted in 2005 by the Office of Minority Health—a U.S. Department of Health—African American men were 30% more likely than white men to die from heart disease. Also African American women were 34% more likely to die from breast cancer than their white counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Colonies {{of the red}} {{imported}} {{fire ant}} have tunneling surfaces that protrude out of the surfaces where workers forage. These areas of protrusion tend to be within their own territory, but greater ant colonisation can affect this. Tunnels are designed to allow effective body, limb and antennae interactions with walls, and a worker can also move exceptionally fast inside them (more than nine bodylengths per second). The holes exit out of any point within the colony's territory, and foraging workers may need to travel half a metre to reach the surface. Assuming the average forager travels 5 m, over 90% of foraging time is inside the tunnels {{during the day and}} rarely at night. Workers forage in soil temperatures reaching 27°C (80°F) and surface temperatures of 12–51°C (53–123°F). Workers exposed to temperatures of 42°C (107°F) are at risk <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> the heat. The rate of workers foraging drops rapidly by autumn, and they rarely emerge during winter. This {{may be due to the}} effects of soil temperature, and a decreased preference for food sources. These preferences only decrease when brood production is low. In the northern regions of the United States, areas are too cold for the ant to forage, but in other areas such as Florida and Texas, foraging may occur all year round. When it is raining, workers do not forage outside, as exit holes are temporarily blocked, pheromone trails are washed away, and foragers may be physically struck by the rain. The soil's moisture may also affect the foraging behaviour of workers.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{treatment of}} OPC was surgical, with an approach through {{the neck and}} splitting of the jaw bone, {{which resulted in a}} considerable risk of death. Later, radiotherapy with or without the addition of chemotherapy, provided a less invasive alternative, and the results in terms of treating the cancer, were comparable. Newer minimally invasive surgical techniques through the mouth have improved outcomes, and surgery is often followed by radiation and or chemotherapy in high risk cases. In the absence of high quality evidence, management decisions are often based on technical factors, likely functional loss and the persons preferences. Some HPV+OPC may first appear in lymph nodes in the neck, without an obvious source (cancer of unknown primary origin) but removal of tonsil tissue from the oropharynx will often show hidden disease. The presence of HPV in the tumour is associated with a better response to treatment and a better outcome, independent of the treatment methods used and a nearly 60% reduced risk <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> the cancer. Most recurrence occurs locally and within the first year after treatment. The use of tobacco decreases the chances of survival. While most head and neck cancer has been declining with reduced smoking rates, HPV+OPC has been increasing. Compared to HPV-OPC patients, HPV+OPC patients tend to be younger, have a higher socioeconomic status and are less likely to smoke. In addition they tend to have smaller tumours, but {{are more likely to have}} involvement of the cervical lymph nodes. In the United States and other countries, the number of cases of oropharyngeal cancer has been increasing steadily, with the incidence of HPV+OPC increasing faster than the decline in HPV-OPC. The increase is seen particularly in young men in developed countries, and HPV+OPC now accounts for the majority of all OPC cases.|$|E
