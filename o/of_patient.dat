40|$|BACKGROUMD. The {{curative}} {{potential of}} radiotherapy CRT) alone as initial treatment {{for patients with}} Stage I-II lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (LPHL) has not been defined well. METHODS. Two hundred two patients who were treated between 1969 and 1995 were evaluated in a retrospective, multicenter study. RESULTS. Patient characteristics were as follows: The median age was 31 years, 75 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> were male, 80 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> had Ann Arbor Stage I disease, 1 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> had bulky disease, 3 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> had B symptoms, 1 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> had extranodal involvement, and 80 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> had supradiaphragmatic disease. The RT fields were a full mantle field in 52 % <b>of</b> <b>patients,</b> less than a full mantle field in 24 % <b>of</b> <b>patients,</b> an inverted-Y field in 17 % <b>of</b> <b>patients,</b> less than an inverted-Y field in 3 % <b>of</b> <b>patients,</b> and total lymph node irradiation in 3 % <b>of</b> <b>patients.</b> The median dose was 36 Gray. The median follow-up was 15 years. The overall survival (OS) rate at 15 years was 83 %, and freedom from progression (FFP) was observed in 82 % <b>of</b> <b>patients,</b> including 84 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> with Stage I disease and 73 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> with Stage II disease. No recurrent LPHL and only 1 patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) were reported after 15 years. Adverse prognostic factors that were identified on multifactor analysis were as follows: for OS, age 45 years or older (P < 0. 0005), the presence of B symptoms (P = 0. 002), increasing number of sites (P = 0. 015); for FFP, increasing number of sites (P= 0. 002). No {{significant difference was found}} in FFP in a comparison <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> who received elective mediastinal RT with patients who did not receive mediastinal RT (P = 0. 11). Causes of death at 15 years were LPHL in 3 % <b>of</b> <b>patients,</b> NHL in 2 % <b>of</b> <b>patients,</b> in-field malignancy in 2 % <b>of</b> <b>patients,</b> in-field cardiac/respiratory in 4 % <b>of</b> <b>patients,</b> and other in 6 % <b>of</b> <b>patients.</b> CONCLUSIONS. The current data suggested that RT potentially may be curative for patients with Stage I-II LPHL and raise the possibility that limited-field RT may be used without loss of treatment efficacy. Involved-field RT warrants further inves-tigation for patients with early-stage LPHL...|$|R

5|$|In {{clinical}} immunology, {{levels of}} individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) {{to characterize the}} antibody profile <b>of</b> <b>patient.</b> Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear. For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis, elevated IgM indicates viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis.|$|E

5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both {{in the sense of the}} previous accusative case (in the role <b>of</b> <b>patient,</b> or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E
