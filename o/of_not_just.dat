25|$|A {{landmark}} {{in the history}} of art criticism, this essay synthesizes the aesthetic preoccupations <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> the Cubists, but of Apollinaire himself. The volume is valued today as a work of reference and a vintage example of creative modernist writing.|$|E

25|$|To {{this end}} the authors asked four adults {{to read a}} text {{reflected}} in a mirror for ten minutes a day for five months. In all subjects, the words were not perceived in their globality but required a meticulous analysis of the letters and syllables. They also demonstrated total or partial inversions even sometimes affecting {{the order of the}} words in a sentence. They revealed a curious impression <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> horizontal but also vertical inversions. These are errors that exist amongst people with dyslexia and they suffer from the aggravating circumstance inherent in all learning.|$|E
25|$|CBS {{was unsure}} whether the {{controversial}} {{subject matter of}} All in the Family would fit well into a sitcom. Racial issues, ethnicities, religions, class, education, women's equality, gun control, politics, inflation, the Vietnam war, energy crisis, Watergate and other timely topics of the 1970s were addressed. Like its British predecessor Till Death Us Do Part, the show lent dramatic social substance to the traditional sitcom format. Archie Bunker's popularity made O'Connor a top-billing star of the 1970s. O'Connor was afraid of being typecast for playing the role, {{but at the same}} time, he was protective <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> his character, but of the entire show, too.|$|E
25|$|The VOC had {{two types}} of shareholders: the participanten, who {{could be seen as}} non-{{managing}} members, and the 76 bewindhebbers (later reduced to 60) who acted as managing directors. This was the usual set-up for Dutch joint-stock companies at the time. The innovation {{in the case of the}} VOC was that the liability <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> the participanten but also of the bewindhebbers was limited to the paid-in capital (usually, bewindhebbers had unlimited liability). The VOC therefore was a limited liability company. Also, the capital would be permanent during the lifetime of the company. As a consequence, investors that wished to liquidate their interest in the interim could only do this by selling their share to others on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.|$|E

25|$|Also in October 2008 U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines {{announced}} that, {{as part of}} a major {{expansion of}} its route network in Africa, it would begin a once-weekly service between Atlanta and Monrovia, via Sal, Cape Verde. The proposed service would have commenced in June 2009, utilizing a Boeing 757-200 configured for ETOPS operations in a two-class configuration. The news marked the return of an American carrier and direct flights to the United States {{for the first time since}} Pan Am's withdrawal, and would make RIA one of only a handful of African airports with service to the US, so was therefore seen as a major step in the recovery <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> the airport, but Liberia itself. The route was revised in May to originate from New York's JFK and connect via Dakar, beginning on 9 June, Monday, and returning every Tuesday.|$|E

500|$|Dylan's lyrics {{began to}} receive {{detailed}} scrutiny from academics and poets {{as early as}} 1998, when Stanford University sponsored the first international academic conference on Bob Dylan {{to be held in}} the United States. In 2004, Richard F. Thomas, Classics professor at Harvard University, created a freshman seminar titled [...] "Dylan" [...] "to put the artist in context <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> popular culture of the last half-century, but the tradition of classical poets like Virgil and Homer." [...] William Arctander O'Brien, literary scholar and professor of German and Comparative Literature at the University of California, San Diego, memorialized the significance of Dylan's contribution to world literature when he created a full academic course in 2009 devoted to Dylan, which analyzed and celebrated the [...] "historical, political, economic, aesthetic, and cultural significance of Dylan’s work." ...|$|E
500|$|Strong took {{a principled}} {{stand against the}} War of 1812, {{generally}} refusing to assist federal government efforts to prosecute the war. [...] Strong {{was part of a}} chorus of Massachusetts (and more broadly New England) Federalists who complained that in [...] "Mr. Madison's War" [...] the federal government was trampling state and individual rights. [...] He adhered to the view that state militia could not be required to serve under regular army command. When the first such requests were made by U. S. Army General Henry Dearborn, Strong, with the backing <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> the Governor's Council but also the Supreme Judicial Court, refused, arguing that {{there was no need to}} call out the militia because invasion was not imminent. [...] Because of his stance against regular army command, the state was denied a shipment of arms that was instead diverted to frontier areas and the war theater. [...] Strong also took no particular actions to prevent widespread smuggling along the state's frontiers with the neighboring British provinces.|$|E
500|$|The French action {{drew the}} {{attention}} <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> the British, but also the Indian tribes of the area. [...] Despite good Franco-Indian relations, British traders had become highly successful in convincing the Indians to trade with them in preference to the Canadiens, and the planned large-scale advance was not well received by all. [...] In particular, Tanacharison, a Mingo chief {{also known as the}} [...] "Half King", became decidedly anti-French as a consequence. [...] In a meeting with Paul Marin de la Malgue, commander of the French and Canadien construction force, the latter reportedly lost his temper, and shouted at the Indian chief, [...] "I tell you, down the river I will go. [...] If the river is blocked up, I have the forces to burst it open and tread under my feet all that oppose me. [...] I despise all the stupid things you have said." [...] He then threw down some wampum that Tanacharison had offered as a good will gesture. [...] Marin died not long after, and command of the operations was turned over to Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre.|$|E

500|$|Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell {{writes that}} it was Ditko who noted the {{similarities}} to the Fly. Ditko recalled that, [...] "Stan called Jack about the Fly", adding that [...] "ays later, Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan's synopsis". It {{was at this point}} that the nature of the strip changed. [...] "Out went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained". Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, a premise Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as [...] "the first work for hire artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series". On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko states, [...] "I still don't know whose idea was Spider-Man". Kirby noted in a 1971 interview {{that it was}} Ditko who [...] "got Spider-Man to roll, and the thing caught on because of what he did". Lee, while claiming credit for the initial idea, has acknowledged Ditko's role, stating, [...] "If Steve wants to be called co-creator, I think he deserves [...] ". He has further commented that Ditko's costume design was key to the character's success; since the costume completely covers Spider-Man's body, people of all races could visualize themselves inside the costume and thus more easily identify with the character. Writer Al Nickerson believes [...] "that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created the Spider-Man that we are familiar with today [...] ultimately, Spider-Man came into existence, and prospered, through the efforts <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> one or two, but many, comic book creators".|$|E
500|$|Ian Berriman of SFX {{rated the}} episode {{four and a}} half stars out of five and felt that it showed [...] "how every SF-related {{casualty}} {{is more than just a}} statistic– it’s also someone’s life-destroying tragedy". He thought the episode had a few logic gaps but that the emotional focus was enough to distract the audience from this. He felt that the sequence where Gwen's husband Rhys [...] "tears a strip off Gwen, then reminds her what Torchwood is fighting for" [...] was the episode's highlight. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy stated that the script [...] "neatly brings out the conflicting components within Gwen's character" [...] and praised the episode for raising the moral dilemma of whether to reveal the truth or not. He gave the episode four stars, feeling it to highlight the versatility of Torchwood as a series and to show [...] "how badly science-fiction is overlooked as serious, well-crafted drama". IGN's Travis Fickett rated the episode 9.5 out of ten ("Amazing") and stated it to be [...] "the kind of science fiction that every series should aspire to create." [...] He felt that the episode worked for viewers unfamiliar with the show whilst managing to progress [...] "every regular character in the series". He felt that the episode handled the subject matter of missing people thoughtfully and sensitively whilst furthering the relationship between Rhys and Gwen, stating that it was the [...] "best episode Gwen has had to date" [...] which showcased [...] "Eve Myles range" [...] and Kai Owen's [...] "tremendous power as an actor." [...] Fickett concluded his review by stating that [...] "this is very nearly a perfect episode <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> Torchwood, but the genre of science fiction and the medium of television".|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] was a {{favorite}} of Selena's younger fan base. Posthumous reviews have cited the song as being [...] "catchy". Ramiro Burr of Billboard magazine believed that the song could have easily been successful in European clubs thanks to its striking resemblance to Euro-pop and Eurodance songs that were popular in Europe at the time. Tom Whitehurst Jr. of the Corpus Christi Caller Times wrote {{that he did not know}} what [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] meant but, after a friend played him a tape of the recording, he became a fan of the singer. Andrew Mitchell, also from the Corpus Christi Caller Times, called the song [...] "happy" [...] and said that it was [...] "only natural to want to know the meaning <b>of</b> , <b>not</b> <b>just</b> memorize [...] lyrics to sing along. Music can teach. It can remove barriers of the mind and soul." [...] Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, called the song [...] "bouncy". Musicologists Ilan Stavans and Harold Augenbraum called [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom", [...] "No Me Queda Más", and [...] "Techno Cumbia" [...] the [...] "key hits of [...] ". Peter Watrous of The New York Times called the song [...] "lightweight" [...] but found it to be: [...] "better than [...] ". Sue Anne Pressley of the Washington Post wrote that [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] was [...] "sprightly carefree", and [...] "infectious". Writing for the San Antonio Express-News, Michael Clark complimented A.B.'s addition of [...] "world-music flourishes" [...] to the song. Katherine Seligman, also from the San Antonio Express News, described the recording as an: [...] "infectiously happy song". Sun Sentinel contributor, Steve Bennett also called the recording [...] "infectious".|$|E
