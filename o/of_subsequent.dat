5|$|A small, unisex monastic {{community}} in Bithynia, near Constantinople, may {{have developed the}} cross-in-square plan church during the Iconoclastic period, which would explain the plan's small scale and unified naos. The ruined church of St. John at Pelekete monastery is an early example. Monks had supported the use of icons, unlike the government-appointed secular clergy, and monasticism would become increasingly popular. A new type of privately funded urban monastery developed from the 9th century on, which may help to explain the small size <b>of</b> <b>subsequent</b> building.|$|E
5|$|Although only {{moderately}} {{successful in}} America, Letters was immediately popular in Europe upon its publication in 1782. Prompted by high demand, Crèvecœur produced an expanded French version {{that was published}} two years later. The work is recognised as {{being one of the}} first in the canon of American literature, and has influenced a diverse range <b>of</b> <b>subsequent</b> works.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod shells {{occasionally}} show {{evidence of}} damage by predators, and sometimes <b>of</b> <b>subsequent</b> repair. Fish and crustaceans {{seem to find}} brachiopod flesh distasteful. The fossil record shows that drilling predators like gastropods attacked molluscs and echinoids 10 to 20 times more often than they did brachiopods, suggesting that such predators attacked brachiopods by mistake or when other prey was scarce. In waters where food is scarce, the snail Capulus ungaricus steals food from bivalves, snails, tube worms, and brachiopods.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{disagree}} on Tristano's importance in jazz history. Max Harrison {{indicated that the}} pianist had limited influence outside his own group of affiliated musicians; Robert Palmer, who pointed out that only one of Tristano's albums was in print {{at the time of}} his death, suggested that he was pivotal in the change from 1940s modern jazz to the freer styles <b>of</b> <b>subsequent</b> decades; and Thomas Albright similarly believed that his improvising prepared and developed new ground in the history of the music.|$|E
5|$|In {{secondary}} spontaneous pneumothorax, {{the estimated}} annual AAIR is 6.3 and 2.0 cases per 100,000 person-years {{for males and}} females, respectively, with the risk of recurrence depending on the presence and severity of any underlying lung disease. Once a second episode has occurred, {{there is a high}} likelihood <b>of</b> <b>subsequent</b> further episodes. The incidence in children has not been well studied, but is estimated to be between 5 and 10 cases per 100,000 person-years.|$|E
5|$|P.atriplicifolia {{has been}} the subject <b>of</b> <b>subsequent</b> studies seeking to clarify the {{relationships}} within Mentheae. Further research combined palynological analysis of pollen grains with rbcL sequencing to provide additional support for the relationship between Perovskia and Salvia clade I. It also distinguished between P.atriplicifolia and P.abrotanoides, while confirming their close relationship. A subsequent multigene study (four cpDNA markers and two nrDNA markers) redrew parts of the Mentheae cladogram, making Rosmarinus a sister group to Perovskia.|$|E

5|$|Recent studies, {{based on}} the {{discovery}} of a penny of Eanred for which a date no earlier than c. 850 is proposed, suggest a very different dating for ninth-century Northumbrian kings. From this, it is argued that Eardwulf's second reign ended circa 830, rather than in the years soon after 810, and that the reigns <b>of</b> <b>subsequent</b> kings should be re-dated accordingly: Eanred from 830 to 854, Æthelred II from 854 to 862, Rædwulf in 858, and Osberht from 862 to 867.|$|E
5|$|Somerset is a rural {{county of}} rolling hills {{such as the}} Blackdown Hills, Mendip Hills, Quantock Hills and Exmoor National Park, and large flat expanses of land {{including}} the Somerset Levels. There is evidence of human occupation from Paleolithic times, and <b>of</b> <b>subsequent</b> settlement in the Celtic, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. The county played a significant part in the consolidation of power and rise of King Alfred the Great, {{and later in the}} English Civil War and the Monmouth Rebellion. The city of Bath is famous for its substantial Georgian architecture and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 title PaRappa the Rapper {{has been}} deemed the first {{influential}} rhythm game, whose basic template formed the core <b>of</b> <b>subsequent</b> {{games in the}} genre. In 1997, Konami's Beatmania sparked an emergent market for rhythm games in Japan. The company's music division, Bemani, released a series of music-based games {{over the next several}} years. The most successful of these was the 1998 dance mat game Dance Dance Revolution, which was the only Bemani title to achieve large-scale success outside Japan, and would see numerous imitations of the game from other publishers.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. KAL007 Victims' Association, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Hans Ephraimson-Abt, successfully lobbied U.S. Congress and the airline industry to accept an agreement that would ensure that future victims of airline incidents would be compensated quickly and fairly by increasing compensation and lowering the burden of proof of airliner misconduct.

5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism. Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness {{is not the same as}} the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion <b>of</b> <b>subsequent</b> generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E
5|$|The first {{effective}} {{polio vaccine}} {{was developed in}} 1952 by Jonas Salk and a team at the University of Pittsburgh that included Julius Youngner, Byron Bennett, L.

Salk went on CBS radio to report a successful test on {{a small group of}} adults and children on 26 March 1953; two days later the results were published in JAMA.

5|$|The white Schnauzer {{is one of}} four color {{varieties}} of the Miniature Schnauzer currently recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.

The controversy rests on the disputed origins of the white variation: whether it was contained within the genes of the originally recognized breed, or whether it was the result <b>of</b> <b>subsequent</b> modifications. Since the other two Schnauzer types have never been available in a white variation, and the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the AMSC chooses not to recognize white.|$|E
