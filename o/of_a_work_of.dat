5|$|The K Foundation {{was an art}} {{foundation}} set up by Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty (The KLF) in 1993, {{following their}} 'retirement' from the music industry. The Foundation served as an artistic outlet for the duo's post-retirement KLF income. Between 1993 and 1995, they spent this money {{in a number of}} ways, including on a series of Situationist-inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions in the art world, focusing in particular on the Turner Prize. Most notoriously, when their plans to use banknotes as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> art fell through, they burned a million pounds in cash.|$|E
5|$|Richard Barre (c. 1130– c. 1202) was {{a medieval}} English justice, clergyman and scholar. He was educated {{at the law}} school of Bologna and entered royal service under King Henry II of England, later working for Henry's son and {{successor}} Richard I. He was also briefly in the household of Henry's son Henry the Young King. Barre served the elder Henry as a diplomat and {{was involved in a}} minor way with the king's quarrel with Thomas Becket, which earned Barre a condemnation from Becket. After King Henry's death, Barre became a royal justice during Richard's reign {{and was one of the}} main judges in the period from 1194 to 1199. After disagreeing with him earlier in his career, Barre was discharged from his judgeship during John's reign as king. Barre was also archdeacon of Ely and the author <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> biblical extracts dedicated to one of his patrons, William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely and Chancellor of England.|$|E

25|$|Classical Japanese {{literature}} generally {{refers to}} literature produced during the Heian Period, what some {{would consider a}} golden era of art and literature. The Tale of Genji (early 11th century) by Murasaki Shikibu is considered the pre-eminent masterpiece of Heian fiction and an early example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> fiction {{in the form of}} a novel. It is sometimes called the world's first novel, the first modern novel, the first romance novel, or the first novel to still be considered a classic.|$|E
25|$|Lawrence and Frieda soon {{went back}} to Italy, staying in a cottage in Fiascherino on the Gulf of Spezia. Here he started writing the first draft <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> fiction {{that was to be}} {{transformed}} into two of his best-known novels, The Rainbow and Women in Love, in which unconventional female characters take centre stage. Both novels were highly controversial, and both were banned on publication in the UK for obscenity (Women in Love only temporarily). Both novels cover grand themes and ideas.|$|E

25|$|On 14 May 1937, the BBC Television Service in London {{broadcast}} a thirty-minute excerpt of the play, {{the first known}} instance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Shakespeare being performed on television. Produced for the new medium by George More O'Ferrall, the production is also notable for having featured a young actress who would later go on to win an Academy Award – Greer Garson. As the performance was transmitted live from the BBC's studios at Alexandra Palace and the technology to record television programmes did not at the time exist, no visual record survives other than still photographs.|$|E
25|$|The demiurge {{creates the}} {{physical}} universe {{and the physical}} aspect of humanity. The demiurge typically creates a group of co-actors named archons who preside over the material realm and, in some cases, present obstacles to the soul seeking ascent from it. The inferiority of the demiurge's creation may {{be compared to the}} technical inferiority <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> art, painting, sculpture, etc. to the thing the art represents. In other cases it takes on a more ascetic tendency to view material existence negatively, which then becomes more extreme when materiality, including the human body, is perceived as evil and constrictive, a deliberate prison for its inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|On 14 May 2008, the Triptych, 1976, sold at Sotheby's for €55.465million ($86.28million), then {{a record}} for the artist and the highest price paid for a postwar work of art at auction up to 2008. On 13 November 2013, Three Studies of Lucian Freud sold at Christie's New York for $142.4 million, surpassing both Triptych and 1976 in {{auctioned}} value, and more importantly claiming the record for highest auction price <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> art at that time, a title previously held by the fourth version of Edvard Munch's Scream and now held by Willem de Kooning's Interchange. In September 2015 David Geffen sold de Kooning's oil painting Interchange for $300 million to hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin.|$|E

500|$|Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir {{has been}} {{described}} as possibly Bach's first surviving cantata. [...] For it to be the first, it has to be assumed not only that it predates other cantatas written in Mulhnausen (we know that he wrote at least one other there), but also {{that there is not a}} surviving cantata from his previous post at Arnstadt. It seems likely that Bach was composing choral music at Arnstadt. Although Bach was only 22 when he took up the appointment at Mühlhausen, the performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> his own composition appears to have been part of the selection process. [...] Recent scholarship suggests that another surviving cantata Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150 could have been composed at Arnstadt.|$|E
500|$|Longacre was {{recognized}} in {{an exhibit of}} 100 notable American engravers sponsored by the New York Public Library in 1928. [...] In 1970, art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on U.S. coins, viewed Longacre and his works less favorably, [...] "uniform in their dullness, lack of inspiration, and even quaintness, Longacre's contributions to patterns and regular coinage were a decided step backwards from the art of [...] Sully, [...] Peale, [...] Hughes, and Gobrecht" [...] and [...] "whatever his previous qualities as an engraver of portraits, he {{seems not to have}} brought much imagination to his important post at the Philadelphia Mint." [...] However, Vermeule considered the Flying Eagle cent more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> art, far above the mundane.|$|E

500|$|Jennens's {{letter to}} Holdsworth of 10 July 1741, {{in which he}} first {{mentions}} Messiah, suggests that the text was a recent work, probably assembled earlier that summer. As a devout Anglican and believer in scriptural authority, Jennens intended to challenge advocates of Deism, who rejected the doctrine of divine intervention in human affairs. Shaw describes the text as [...] "a meditation of our Lord as Messiah in Christian thought and belief", and despite his reservations on Jennens's character, concedes that the finished wordbook [...] "amounts to little short <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> genius". There {{is no evidence that}} Handel played any active role in the selection or preparation of the text, such as he did in the case of Saul; it seems, rather, that he saw no need to make any significant amendment to Jennens's work.|$|E
500|$|Language, meanwhile, they {{describe}} as [...] "quite literally {{the material of}} the literary artist"; although a work is influenced by language, the writer's style, the use of communicative language, may influence language. Rather than use a work to study linguistic history, they recommend examining works through stylistics, which in literature they define as [...] "the study <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> art {{or a group of}} works which are to be described in terms of their aesthetic function and meaning". Such studies can be done either as a search for a [...] "total meaning" [...] or a [...] "sum of individual traits". Ideally, such a study should [...] "establish some unifying principle, some general aesthetic" [...] in a work or genre, although some may be more difficult than others. As such, they reject stylistic studies which focus mainly on [...] "peculiarities of style" [...] or which are linked to extrinsic elements.|$|E
500|$|After the war, Moore {{rejected}} {{a grant to}} study at the University of Cambridge, citing a wish to [...] "stand on my own two feet". He wrote his first book, Guide to the Moon (later retitled Patrick Moore on the Moon) in 1952 and it was published a year later. He wrote it on a 1908 Woodstock typewriter, which he used for every book he published. He was a teacher in Woking and at Holmewood House School in Langton Green, from 1945 to 1953. His second book was a translation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> French astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs (Moore spoke fluent French). After his second original science book, Guide to the Planets, he penned his first work of fiction, The Master of the Moon, the first of numerous young adult fiction space adventure books (including the late 1970s series the Scott Saunders Space Adventure); he wrote a more adult novel and a farce titled Ancient Lights, {{though he did not}} wish either to be published.|$|E

[...] NGamer compared it to [...] "playing a big budget action blockbuster, only better." [...] GamePro called it [...] "this season's top offering [...] and one game no self-respecting gamer should be without," [...] but criticized the frame rate that [...] "occasionally stalls the eye-catching graphics". GameSpot was critical of {{how easy it is}} for the player to avoid being seen, as well as the game's short length, calling it [...] "more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> art than ... an actual game."

500|$|In 1851, John Frederick Kensett (18161872) {{produced}} a large canvas, 40x60inches, of Mount Washington {{that has become}} one of the best and finest later examples of White Mountain art. [...] Barbara J. MacAdam, the Jonathan L. Cohen Curator of America Art at the Hood Museum of Dartmouth College, has written: [...] "John Frederick Kensett first made the scene famous through his monumental landscape, Mount Washington from the Valley of Conway ... Kensett's image became the single most effective mid-nineteenth-century advertisement for the scenic charms of the White Mountains and of North Conway in particular. [...] Mount Washington from the Valley of Conway, purchased by the American Art Union, was made into a print by the engraver James Smillie (18331909) and distributed to over 13,000 Art Union subscribers throughout the country. [...] Many artists painted copies of this same scene from the print, and Currier and Ives published a lithograph of this view in 1860. [...] Kensett’s painting is another example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> art that helped to popularize the region. [...] Catherine Campbell described the painting as [...] "canonical among White Mountain paintings" [...] and [...] "the best known landscape view of the era." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} in trade publications. The Moving Picture World remarked that the play itself was not well-known, {{but that the}} plot was depicted adequately enough that it may encourage a re-perusal of the play. There was no fault found by the reviewer who stated, [...] "The characters of Hardcastle, Kate and Marlow are admirably done and seem to correctly interpret the original. The staging and costuming are {{in harmony with the}} play and reproduce the scenery of the time depicted with accuracy. The usefulness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> this sort does not end with the presentation of the play itself. There is an educational value which includes the costuming and reproduction of the surroundings of the time. These are so unfamiliar now that they afford not a little addition to the interest and pleasure of such a film. The work has been done so well that the company deserves commendation for undertaking the task. It is not an easy manner to reproduce a play of this character, and when it is well done the company performing it deserves praise." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror disagreed on almost all points, [...] "In numerous details the illusion is dispelled, for the scenery is manifestly not of the eighteenth century. No contemporary of Goldsmith ever rode in such a barouche as appears in this film, nor lived in such a house as Mr. Hardcastle. The final tableau is as artificial as set pieces which have gone out of style at funerals. With all of its imperfections there is considerable of virile comedy in the film." [...] Though the Mirror reviewer stated that despite the elimination of the Hastings and Constance Neville subplot, the acting is clear enough that audiences do not need prior knowledge of the play to appreciate the film.|$|E
