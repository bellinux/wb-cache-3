The time to master mushroom cultivation is time consuming and costly in missed revenue.

25|$|The {{downtown}} area, centered {{along and}} around La Grange Road (US 45) and the BNSF Railway line, grew somewhat run-down during the 1980s; however, the mid-to-late 1990s saw a revival, with many new businesses opening including Trader Joe's and Pier I. Many {{of these new}} businesses are restaurants; La Grange draws much <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>business</b> from the neighboring town of Western Springs, since Western Springs did not allow the sale of alcoholic beverages in restaurants until recently.

25|$|EasyJet, like Ryanair, uses a {{business}} model pioneered by Southwest Airlines. Both airlines have adapted this {{model for the}} European market through further cost-cutting measures, such as not selling connecting flights or providing complimentary snacks on board. The key points <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>business</b> model are high aircraft utilisation, quick turnaround times, charging for extras (such as priority boarding, hold baggage and food) and keeping operating costs low. One main difference easyJet and Ryanair have from Southwest is they both fly a young fleet of aircraft. Southwest has an average fleet age of 11.9 years whereas Ryanair's and easyJet's average fleet ages are just a little over six years each.|$|E
25|$|Since Britain's {{victory over}} the Qing Empire in the First Opium War, British traders had sold large amounts of opium to the Chinese to balance their trade. Attitudes towards the {{morality}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>business</b> were slow to change, but in 1874 the Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade was formed in England by Quakers led by the Rev. Frederick Storrs-Turner. By the 1890s, increasingly strident campaigns were waged by Protestant missionaries in China for its abolition. The first such society was established at the 1890 Shanghai Missionary Conference, where British and American representatives, including John Glasgow Kerr, Arthur E. Moule, Arthur Gostick Shorrock and Griffith John, agreed to establish the Permanent Committee for the Promotion of Anti-Opium Societies.|$|E
25|$|On 28 April 1689 Jollie took up {{the case}} of Richard Dugdale, the alleged ‘demoniack’ of Surey, near Clitheroe. He {{maintained}} that Dugdale's was ‘as real a possession as any in the gospels.’ With the aid of over twelve nonconforming divines, including Richard Frankland and Oliver Heywood, he tried exorcism by prayer and fasting. The young man's recovery was slow; the religious meetings began on 8 May 1689, and were not effective till 24 March 1690. In a tract of 1697 Jollie ascribed his cure to the prayers of the nonconformists. Zachary Taylor (died 1703), vicar of Ormskirk, son of an ejected minister of the same name, wrote two tracts (1697–9) to expose the ‘popery’ and ‘knavery’ <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>business.</b> John Carrington (died 1701), presbyterian minister at Lancaster, who had taken part in the exorcism, came forward in its defence; Frankland and Heywood were significantly silent.|$|E

25|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the whaling {{industry}} was an important part of the island's economy. After a few years of traditional whale-hunting the industrialization of the activity was formalized with construction of factory, and whale oil and products were concentrated in the area of Boqueirão. The Fábrica da Baleia do Boqueirão (Whale Factory of Boqueirão), now a part of the Flores Museum, occupies an advantageous place in the area around the port of Boqueirão, with a ramp adapted to drag Sperm whales from the ocean. Its architect <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>business</b> was the Lisbon entrepreneur Francisco Marcelino dos Reis and directed by his partner José Jacinto Mendonça Flores, who was the local investor of Reis & Flores, provisioner to whaling fleets. Construction began in October 1941, and the machinery installed by March 1943. It is likely that the factory began operations in the summer of 1944, probably in the month of July. It continued to operate until 1976. After a couple of tentative attempts to restart operations, it was finally closed in 1981. At its peak (1963) the factory processed 103 whales. The final animal was processed on November 24, 1981 after José Jacinto Mendonça Furtado harpooned the 21st whale of the season.|$|E

In 1772 he, his cousin Remember Baker; and his {{brothers}} Ira, Heman, and Zimri formed the Onion River Company, which was basically a land-speculation organization devoted to purchasing land in and around the Winooski River (known then as the Onion River). The success <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>business</b> depended on the successful defense of the Wentworth grants. Early purchases of the company included about [...] of land from Edward Burling and his partners; land was sold at a profit to Thomas Chittenden among others, and the settlements on the company's land have grown to become the city of Burlington.|$|E

500|$|The Moving Picture News and The Moving Picture World {{were both}} neutral in their {{review of the}} film, giving neither {{specific}} praise nor criticism of the production. The New York Dramatic Mirror review was positive: [...] "This idea has been used quite recently in an Independent film, but not nearly so effectively as {{in the hands of}} the capable Thanhouser players. They give the farcical events an air of reality that goes far to strengthen the comical results. ... She insists on her lover rigging himself up in knightly costume and carrying her off on a horse to be married. The absurdity <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>business</b> in modern times is not made as much of as might have been, but it brings plenty of laughter. The actress who played the part of the girl marred her work by turning too often to face the camera. She is very pretty and attractive but she should not permit it to appear that she is so well aware of her beauty."

500|$|Prior to {{independence}} being declared, a Committee of Five {{was charged with}} drafting the Declaration, and included Adams, along with Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston and Roger Sherman. The Committee, after discussing the general outline that the document should follow, decided that Jefferson would write the first draft. Jefferson particularly thought Adams should write the document; but Adams persuaded the Committee to choose Jefferson while agreeing to consult with Jefferson personally. Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson on the question: Jefferson asked, [...] "Why will you not? You ought to do it." [...] To which Adams responded, [...] "I will not – reasons enough." [...] Jefferson replied, [...] "What can be your reasons?" [...] And Adams responded, [...] "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear at the head <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>business.</b> Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can." [...] "Well," [...] said Jefferson, [...] "if you are decided, I will {{do as well as}} I can." [...] Adams concluded, [...] "Very well. When you have drawn it up, we will have a meeting." [...] The Committee left no minutes, and the drafting process itself is uncertain – accounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, although frequently cited, are otherwise contradictory. Although the first draft was written primarily by Jefferson, Adams assumed a primary role in its completion. After editing the document further, Congress approved it on July 4. Many years later Jefferson hailed Adams as [...] "the pillar of [...] support on the floor of Congress, [...] ablest advocate and defender against the multifarious assaults it encountered." ...|$|E

[...] The view that a single recession lasted from 1873 to 1896 or 1897 is not supported by most modern reviews of the period.
