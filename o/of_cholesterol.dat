5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingolipids {{are involved}} in the intestinal uptake <b>of</b> <b>cholesterol.</b> Studies in adult rodents have shown that milk sphingomyelin could lower the intestinal absorption <b>of</b> <b>cholesterol</b> in a dose-dependent manner. Intestinal cholesterol absorption in adult rodents consuming a high fat diet was limited by sphingomyelin supplementation. Milk sphingomyelin and other phospholipids with high affinity for cholesterol could limit the micellar solubility of intestinal cholesterol, thereby limiting the cholesterol uptake by the enterocyte. Dietary sphingolipids have been shown to dose-dependently lower plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol in adult rodents fed with Western-type diet and protect the liver from fat- and cholesterol-induced steatosis. Dietary sphingolipids also lowers hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels in adult rodents partly by modulating hepatic gene expression.|$|E

5|$|All {{corticosteroid}} hormones share cholesterol as {{a common}} precursor. Therefore, {{the first step in}} steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis. Cells that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths. The main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as cholesterol esters within low density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL enters the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The other source <b>of</b> <b>cholesterol</b> is synthesis in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. Synthesis can compensate when LDL levels are abnormally low. In the lysosome, cholesterol esters are converted to free cholesterol, which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell.|$|E

5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} <b>of</b> <b>cholesterol</b> in {{the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E

5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend {{that the decision to}} treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels <b>of</b> <b>cholesterol</b> since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.|$|E
5|$|LDL {{cholesterol}} normally circulates in {{the body}} for 2.5 days, and subsequently the apolipoprotein B portion of LDL cholesterol binds to the LDL receptor on the liver cells, triggering its uptake and digestion. This process results in the removal of LDL from the circulatory system. Synthesis <b>of</b> <b>cholesterol</b> by the liver is suppressed in the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. In FH, LDL receptor function is reduced or absent, and LDL circulates for an average duration of 4.5 days, resulting in significantly increased level of LDL cholesterol in the blood with normal levels of other lipoproteins. In mutations of ApoB, reduced binding of LDL particles to the receptor causes the increased level of LDL cholesterol. It is not known how the mutation causes LDL receptor dysfunction in mutations of PCSK9 and ARH.|$|E
5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13â28 g/100g for adult locust, 14â18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19â26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg <b>of</b> <b>cholesterol.</b> Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic and linolenic acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant.

5|$|Sterol lipids, such as {{cholesterol}} and its derivatives, {{are an important}} component of membrane lipids, along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins. The steroids, all derived from the same fused four-ring core structure, have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules. The eighteen-carbon (C18) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and androsterone. The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The secosteroids, comprising various forms of vitamin D, are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the core structure. Other examples of sterols are the bile acids and their conjugates, which in mammals are oxidized derivatives <b>of</b> <b>cholesterol</b> and are synthesized in the liver.

40|$|Background/Aims: The {{accumulation}} <b>of</b> free <b>cholesterol</b> in atherosclerotic lesions {{has been}} well documented in both animals and humans. In studying the relevance <b>of</b> free <b>cholesterol</b> buildup in atherosclerosis, contradictory results have been generated, indicating that free cholesterol produces both pro- and anti-atherosclerosis effects in macrophages. This inconsistency might stem from the examination of only select concentrations <b>of</b> free <b>cholesterol.</b> In the present study, we sought to investigate the implication <b>of</b> excess free <b>cholesterol</b> loading in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis across a broad concentration range from (in Âµg/ml) 0 to 60. Methods: Macrophage viability was determined by measuring formazan formation and flow cytometry viable cell counting. The polarization of M 1 and M 2 macrophages was differentiated by FACS (Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting) assay. The secretion of IL- 1 Î² in macrophage culture medium was measured by ELISA kit. Macrophage apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry using a TUNEL kit. Results: Macrophage viability was increased at the treatment of lower concentrations <b>of</b> free <b>cholesterol</b> from (in Âµg/ml) 0 to 20, but gradually decreased at higher concentrations from 20 to 60. Lower free cholesterol loading induced anti-inflammatory M 2 macrophage polarization. The activation of the PPAR&# 947; (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma) nuclear factor underscored the stimulation of this M 2 phenotype. Nevertheless, higher levels <b>of</b> free <b>cholesterol</b> resulted in pro-inflammatory M 1 activation. Moreover, with the application <b>of</b> higher free <b>cholesterol</b> concentrations, macrophage apoptosis and secretion of the inflammatory cytokine IL- 1 Î² increased significantly.
