50|$|The TPW1 far-offshore wind site is {{acknowledged}} as the premier site in North America and especially The Great Lakes. The TPW1 site {{was to be}} located in northeastern Lake Ontario, approximately 38 km southwest of Kingston, Ontario on the shoals of Main Duck Island. The projectwas to consist of approximately 90 to 100 either 5.0 MW or 6.0 far-offshore turbines and two <b>offshore</b> <b>substations</b> linked to the Lennox Transmission Station by way of an underwater cable. The total project cost was estimated at $1.5 billion CDN of private capital with no cost to taxpayers for the proposed construction.|$|R
2500|$|Turbines were {{supplied}} by Siemens Wind Power. Their foundations were {{built by the}} joint-venture between Per Aarsleff and Bilfinger Berger Ingenieurbau GmbH. The same company supplied and installed the monopiles. Generators were installed by MPI and A2SEA by using an installation vessel [...] and a jack-up barge Sea Worker. Two <b>offshore</b> <b>substations</b> were designed, fabricated and installed by Future Energy, {{a joint venture between}} Fabricom, Iemants and Geosea, while electrical systems and onshore substation work was undertaken by Siemens Transmission & Distribution.

50|$|In December 2012, after public consulation, {{the wind}} farm was reduced {{in size from}} 76.4 to 67.5 sq mi to reduce visual impact from coastal areas, with {{the maximum number of}} {{turbines}} cut from 333 to 218, and the maximum turbine height reduced from 210 to 200 m. The reduced wind farm had an estimated maximum capacity of around 1100 MW. Design expectations were for turbines of 5 to 8 MW capacity, foundation design was not finalised, but monopile foundations had been excluded from use in the southern half of the site. The offshore development would also include up to three (33 or 66 kV to 132 or 275 kV AC) <b>offshore</b> <b>substations,</b> and a meteorological mast.|$|R
50|$|GeoSea {{was awarded}} the {{contract}} to install foundation piles in April 2013. The first foundation pile was installed in February 2014.

The installation of a 2,000 tonne <b>offshore</b> <b>substation</b> was completed in April of 2017: however, backfilling has been delayed due to a digger being lost off Lancing beach, with salvage attempts ongoing as of late May 2017. Construction of the wind farm is expected to be completed in 2018 at a cost of £1.3 billion.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} constant Volt/Hz operation of offshore wind power plants. The deployment of offshore WPPs requires power transmission from the plant to the load center inland. Since this power transmission requires submarine cables, {{there is a need}} to use High-Voltage Direct Current transmission, which is economical for transmission distances longer than 50 kilometers. In the concept presented here, the onshore substation is operated at 60 Hz synced with the grid, and the <b>offshore</b> <b>substation</b> is operated at variable frequency and voltage, thus allowing the WPP to be operated at constant Volt/Hz...|$|E

A cable was laid by Stemat Spirit. Phase 1 connects to a substation at Heysham and Phase 2 connects to substation at Stanah, south of Fleetwood. Both undersea cables pass close by Barrow Wind Farm. All the construction work was expected to take less than 2 years, with both phases operational {{by the end of}} 2011. On 11 July 2011 Phase 1 became operational, comprising 51 turbines with an installed capacity of 183.6MW.|$|R
5000|$|Preparatory {{construction}} {{work for the}} development included {{the extension of the}} national-grid electricity substation at Walpole, Norfolk, which began in April 2009.

40|$|The current {{development}} of electric power industry in Poland, {{especially in the}} field of renewable energy sources, including wind power, brings about the need to introduce legislation on new work environment. The {{development of}} occupational safety and health (OSH) regulations that must be met by new workplaces, such as offshore substations becomes necessary in view of the construction of modern offshore wind power plants – offshore wind farms. Staying on <b>offshore</b> <b>substation</b> is associated with an increased exposure to harmful health factors: physical, chemical, biological and psychophysical. The main sources of health risks on offshore substations are: temperature, electromagnetic field, noise from operating wind turbines, direct and alternating current, chemicals, Legionella bacteria and social isolation of people. The aim {{of this article is to}} draw attention to the problem of <b>offshore</b> <b>substation</b> workers’ exposure to harmful factors and to present methods of preventing and reducing the risk-related adverse health effects. In this paper, there are identified and described risks occurring on offshore substations (fire, explosion, lightning, accidents at work). Some examples of the means and the methods for reducing the negative impact of exposure on the human health are presented and discussed. The article also highlights the need to develop appropriate laws and health and safety regulations concerning the new working environment at the offshore substations. The review of researches and international standards shows that some of them can be introduced into the Polish labor market. Med Pr 2016; 67 (1) : 51 – 7...|$|E
40|$|According {{to recent}} studies by 2020 {{a share of}} almost 12 % of the {{worldwide}} electricity demand will be provided by the wind. Offshore wind farms {{are expected to have}} a significant growth to meet these targets, but higher procurement and operating costs are still limiting factors for their development. Several configurations based on internal DC collection have been proposed with the aim of reducing costs. Within these schemes, an attractive concept is the series connection of a sufficiently high number of turbine units to allow HVDC transmission without an <b>offshore</b> <b>substation.</b> The paper presents a novel rectifier topology for the series connection of turbine units containing only diodes and thyristors in order to combine low cost, high converter efficiency and high reliability...|$|E
40|$|Using of {{mathematical}} transformations and {{digital signal processing}} (DSP) methods of recorded voltage and currents in power systems in order to extract important informations about physical processes is already known. Higher resolution of measurements and massive introduction of PMU devices in the power systems allows appliance of DSP - based fault location methods in complex power networks. High availability of power systems is required in the modern societies. Fast fault location algorithms and consequent fast repairing of faults is necessary condition for high availability of power networks. Here is represented a numerical procedure for fault location and testing of method already introduced in scientific literature on complex configuration of power network consisting of XLPE underground submarine and land cables between land and <b>offshore</b> <b>substation</b> connecting large wind park with main power system...|$|E
5000|$|... 60 Vestas V90-3MW wind {{turbines}} were installed, with an <b>offshore</b> electrical <b>substation.</b> Prysmian provided two 132 kV export cables each 12.5 km long {{to connect the}} wind farm to the on-shore substation. Two units were subsequently decommissioned in 2015 due to failures during installation. The 174 MW development provides enough electricity for around 117,000 households.|$|R
50|$|By {{the stage}} 2 {{consultation}} (March 2014) the wind farm power export cables, landfall and national grid connection had been narrowed from 16 export cables with potential landfall and grid connection sites {{along the west}} English and north Welsh coasts, to 12 export cables making landfall at 4 sites in North Anglesey connected by an underground cable to a substation at Rhosgoch. The National Grid expects to construct a 400 kV substation adjacent to the onshore Celtic Array wind farm substation, {{and to make the}} connection to the mainland electrical gridon the Wylfa Pentir overhead line. The wind farm at stage 2 was expected to consist of between 146 and 440 (15 MW to 4 MW) wind turbines, with up to 8 HVAC <b>offshore</b> <b>substations</b> plus potentially up to 4 HVDC offshore substations; the use of HVDC was not a preferred option. The wind farm would potentially have had up to 4 offshore accommodation platforms for servicing.|$|R
40|$|In February 2005 {{the worlds}} first {{offshore}} HVDC transmission was successfully commissioned. It {{consists of two}} parallel 40 MW transmissions connecting the Troll A gas platform in the North Sea, with the mainland 132 kV grid via compact polymeric DC cables. A compact and lightweight offshore module was designed by ABB {{in collaboration with the}} client Statoil. The project has allowed valuable experience in the design and construction of high voltage plant in a salt laden, hostile environment to be obtained. With safety as a primary consideration, considerable experience in offshore construction techniques has been gained. The success of the Troll project {{has been one of the}} key components for British Petroleum, who in June 2005 placed a second offshore HVDC Light order with ABB for their 78 MW transmission to the Valhall field. The engineering design and construction challenges overcome in these pioneering offshore projects is directly transferable to the new high power, high voltage, <b>offshore</b> <b>substations</b> required to enable, safe, reliable operation of the future very large offshore wind farms...|$|R
