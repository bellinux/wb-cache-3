Most require changes in state law in order to remove barriers that prevent school districts from implementing these changes.

Even initiatives that do not require legislative action by the state would benefit from statewide leadership to proactively promote significant and sensible cost savings.

2500|$|The Flyboat is {{the primary}} mode of {{transportation}} in the series. The main base is a red flying disc with 4 blue and yellow wheels, it has 3 lights: 1 green, 1 orange and 1 purple; the Flyboat has a clear plastic bottom where 5 gears, that are possibly part of the engine, are visible. The Flyboat's rocket boosters are 2 felt marker caps that are controlled by a green Popsicle stick that when lifted up makes boosters point down, which allows the Flyboat to hover in the air. Lastly, the boat has a mast made out of blue Erector pieces with a marble on top and a sail (the color, design, and print varies) with the Wonder Pets logo on it. Usually, Linny pilots the Flyboat, but there are episodes where Ming-Ming or Tuck pilot it instead. Most other modes of transportation are {{a variation of the}} Flyboat and primarily use the same components such as the Flysub, which is basically a modified Flyboat capable of traveling underwater or modify it to fit a specific theme tied to the theme of the episode such as The Circusboat in [...] "Join the Circus!". In [...] "Save the Raccoon", the Flyboat breaks down during their rescue of a Baby Raccoon stuck in a Recycling Bin and find that its gears have come loose, forcing them to create a new vehicle called the Flycycle from recyclable materials in order to save the Baby Raccoon. In [...] "Save the Loch Ness Monster", it is shown that the Flyboat can be converted in a sail/motor boat by changing the position of the wheels and the boosters, called the Boat-Boat.

The Wonder Pets have trouble building it at first as they are all trying to do everything at the same time so Linny suggests that they build it step-by-step and this solution to build the Babyboat would later inspire them of how to deal with pacifying the crying Baby Piglet. In [...] "Ollie to the Rescue", Ollie creates his own version for his Thunder Pets team, which he calls the Ollieboat. He uses the Flyboats red flying disc as its main base and a carrot for a mast.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} how <b>the</b> {{extensive use}} <b>of</b> networked computers, which were <b>the</b> primary <b>classroom</b> learning resource for three Level 3 cohorts of Further Education students, impacted {{on how the}} students approached <b>the</b> academic elements <b>of</b> their coursework. Using an ethnographic methodology the students were followed as they progressed over one academic year, to identify how they engaged with their learning and used the technologies over this period. <b>The</b> study <b>of</b> students’ <b>classroom</b> academic and literacy practices when using the new digital technologies <b>of</b> computers and <b>the</b> Internet as resources in post-compulsory education is a relatively neglected area. At {{a time when there}} is the continued call for <b>the</b> increased use <b>of</b> these technologies across the curricula, this ethnography offers an insight into students’ responses to the technologies and how these significant educational resources can also divide <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> into both educational and social-leisure spaces. What became apparent over the year was students’ superficial level of engagement with online research resources and how that information was then processed. Students’ use of software to manipulate digital text bypassed any evidencing of intermediary cognitive processes, therefore at times idea generation, critical development and level of ownership became challenging to identify. Notably, students’ extensive use of computers resulted in their gaze being primarily directed to their computer monitors and despite the sociality amongst students for non-educational activities, both in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms,</b> <b>the</b> benefits <b>of</b> peer discussion and interaction for learning was absent due to this level of academic isolation. Students’ use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technologies for either educational or social-leisure use was reflective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> learning conditions and what affected their levels of motivation and attention. For a number of students, their excessive use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> computers to access online social-leisure resources came at a cost to their grades and their ambitions for progression had to be reduced. There is no doubting <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> computers and <b>the</b> Internet as <b>classroom</b> learning resources, however, this research identifies that they are certainly not a quick panacea for education. The evidence illustrates that to attain the potential they offer, there needs to be relative adjustments to pedagogy and learning cultures and how students conceptualise <b>the</b> space <b>of</b> computer-resourced <b>classrooms...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of traditional authoritarian preservice teacher development approaches in Pakistan demonstrates that they develop teachers as technicians who carbon copy the same authoritarian training model in their <b>classrooms.</b> <b>The</b> more contemporary approaches to teacher education with leadership development focus are mostly limited to in-service teacher education programs. The key dilemma with in-service education {{is that once}} the teachers have received higher qualification they tend to move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> to assume management positions. What Pakistan requires is classroom teacher leaders who {{have the capacity to}} initiate and sustain school improvement.

These are: encourage active involvement and delegation of authority among preservice teachers, engage preservice teachers in critical analysis and meta-cognitive tasks, building collaborative teams and professional networks among preservice teachers, providing preservice teachers with experience of working with real-life teacher leaders, and develop preservice teachers’ moral and ethical reasoning.
