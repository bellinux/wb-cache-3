5|$|Freshmen were {{expected}} to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of dead trees <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b>|$|E

The three car parks are at Harlescott (to the north, colour-coded blue), Oxon (to the west, colour-coded pink) and Meole Brace (to the south, colour-coded green). It is proposed that a fourth one be built {{to the east of}} the town, at either Emstrey or Preston.|$|E
5|$|As M-37 crosses into Lake County, {{the highway}} crosses the Pere Marquette River. US10 follows M-37 through Baldwin. The Marquette Rail line turns westward <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> {{and north of}} Baldwin, the highway forms the {{dividing}} line between the Manistee National Forest {{to the west and}} the Pere Marquette State Forest to the east. The road crosses the Little Manistee River near Peacock and the Pine River in southwest Wexford County. M-37 curves to the northeast {{along the edge of the}} Hodenpyl Dam Pond near Mesick. M-37 turns east to follow M-115 through the community and then returns to a northward course into Sherman and on to Buckley. North of the latter community, the highway crosses into Grand Traverse County. The area around Buckley transitions to agricultural use again. This landscape continues past the M-113 to the area known as Chums Corners. There, M-37 merges with US31, and the two run through a small unincorporated community that is host to Wuerfel Park, home of the Traverse City Beach Bums, a minor league baseball team.|$|E

5|$|As {{the raiders}} {{approached}} from the south, the advance elements formed a battle line {{and launched a}} frontal attack and an unsuccessful flanking movement against {{the east side of}} the Legion's works. Reinforcements and artillery soon arrived with the main body of Confederate troops, giving the attackers a strong numerical superiority. With the support of the artillery, a pincer movement caused the Legion to abandon their position to avoid being surrounded. A large part of the Legion were captured as they attempted to escape from the town, while Col. Jordon and others regrouped downtown. Confederates then seized the Legion's commissary supplies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> and fired two warning shots into the downtown from their artillery, convincing Jordan that continued resistance was futile and leading him to surrender his force and Corydon. Although the short battle cost the cavalry twice as many casualties as the outnumbered militia units, the battle resulted in a Confederate victory, which enabled Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan to secure supplies and money before continuing his raid through Indiana and into Ohio. The delay, however, proved critical in helping the pursuing Union army overtake and later capture Morgan and his forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the town was accelerated by {{the opening of the}} railway station in 1839 which stimulated the local economy and was key to the {{development of}} the Star Brewery. Initially Eastern Counties Railway services operated between Mile End and Romford, with extensions to Brentwood and to Shoreditch in 1840. A second station was opened on South Street in 1892 by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway on the line to Upminster and Grays, giving Romford a rail connection to Tilbury Docks. The two stations were combined into one in 1934. Light industry slowly developed, reaching a peak in the 1970s with a number of factories <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> such as the Roneo Vickers office machinery company, Colvern manufacturers of wireless components, May's Sheet Metal Works and brush manufacturers Betterware. Suburban expansion increased the population and reinforced Romford's position as a significant regional town centre. The Liberty Shopping Centre was constructed in the 1960s, and has been modernised and supplemented with further shopping centres throughout the town, including The Mall, opened in 1990 (as 'Liberty 2'); and The Brewery, opened in 2000 on the site of the old Star Brewery.|$|E

25|$|Following World War II, Sonic founder Troy N. Smith Sr. {{returned}} to his hometown of Seminole, Oklahoma, where he became employed as a milkman. He decided to work delivering bread because bread was not as heavy as milk. Soon afterwards, Smith purchased the Cottage Cafe, a little diner in Shawnee, Oklahoma. Before long, he sold it and opened a fast food restaurant, Troy's Pan Full of Chicken, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> In 1953, Smith went in with a business partner to purchase a five-acre parcel of land that had a log house and a walk-up root beer stand, already named the Top Hat. The two men continued with {{the operation of the}} root beer stand and converted the log house into a steak restaurant. After realizing that the stand was averaging $700 a week in the sale of root beer, hamburgers, and hot dogs, Smith decided to focus on the more-profitable root beer stand. He also bought out his business partner.|$|E
25|$|He {{did so in}} a field next to the old {{road that}} led to Pitești. Maluțan then told his four {{passengers}} {{that he could do}} nothing more. The Securitate men ran to the roadside and began to flag down passing cars. Two cars stopped, one of them driven by a forestry official and one a red Dacia driven by a local doctor. However, the doctor was not happy about getting involved and, after a short time driving the Ceaușescus, faked engine trouble. A car of a bicycle repair man was then flagged down and he took them to Târgoviște. The driver of the car, Nicolae Petrișor, convinced them that they could hide successfully in an agricultural technical institute <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> When they arrived, the director guided the Ceaușescus into a room and then locked them in. They were arrested by local police at about 15:30, then after some wandering around transported to the Târgoviște garrison's military compound and held captive for several days until their trial.|$|E
25|$|Bridgeton's most {{successful}} times were now behind them, {{and though they}} maintained their league status for the next 20 years, they never challenged for major honours again. In 1960, New Barrowfield was subject to another housing CPO by the city fathers and Waverley were again forced to move, this time to Carntyne Stadium a mile to the north, which was more suited to greyhound racing and speedway. By this point, many of the local Junior clubs were in financial difficulty; distractions of modern living had made attending matches less appealing, and Glasgow's housing improvement programme was in full swing, {{with much of the}} population of the crowded, substandard tenements decanted to new overspill estates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> – for East End residents this typically meant Easterhouse and Cranhill, although no new Junior teams were established in these vast schemes. Shawfield had folded in 1960, and Bridgeton Waverley followed in 1962. They would not be the last, with Parkhead ceasing operations in 1963, Strathclyde in 1965 and Dennistoun Waverley in 1968. Housing was never built on New Barrowfield as had been planned; it became the training ground for Celtic for the next 40 years and still contains football pitches. Housing now occupies the Carntyne site as well as the Dennistoun ground, the hospital and the Strathclyde ground (which formed part of the Athletes' Village for the 2014 Commonwealth Games), while the Parkhead site is a public park and the Shawfield F.C. ground was bulldozed for the M74 motorway extension.|$|E

500|$|One of the North East's {{most famous}} schools, Barnard Castle {{is set in}} its own 50-acre grounds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> It is located in Teesdale, and is within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Giles Deacon has said of the {{location}} that [...] "you could just walk out and {{you were in the}} middle of the Pennines". The Bowes Museum is situated next to the school. The school caters for pupils aged 4 to 18, with pupils younger than 11 being taught in a separate on-site preparatory school (Prep School). The original building is now used mainly for accommodation and administration and is described as [...] "stately" [...] by The Independent. The school spire is known colloquially as [...] "The Pepperpot". It also contains the dining hall and [...] "Big School", public school slang for the school hall. All teaching is undertaken in purpose-built classrooms. The school site contains tennis/netball courts, squash courts, a large sports hall and an AstroTurf pitch. A total of £3 million has been invested in the school's infrastructure since 2008, including a £1.5 million Physics and ICT block, a new hall for the Prep School and a new sports pavilion containing a gym and a dance studio. The school has been used as a filming location for the television sketch show The Fast Show.|$|E
500|$|During the U.S. third leg, it was {{reported}} that Born to Run would be featured in its entirety during several shows, possibly in a scheme to boost ticket sales. [...] The full-album idea took fruition with the late September-early October set of five shows at Giants Stadium, which would be the final concerts ever in that venue in Springsteen's home state. [...] Born to Run was played at two shows, Darkness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Town</b> at one show, and Born in the U.S.A. at two shows. [...] Springsteen later said of the full album idea, [...] "We had done so many shows and were going to come back around one more time, so we were like, 'OK, what can we do that we haven't done? Let's try to play some of the albums.' There were some people who were starting to do it, it sounded like a good idea, and my audience fundamentally experienced all my music in album form. People took Born to Run home and played it start to finish 100 times; they didn't slip on a cut in the middle. And we made albums – we took a long time, and we built them to last. ... Those records are packed with songs that have lasted 30–35 years. It simply was a way to revitalize the show and do something appealing and fun for the fans, but it ended up being a much bigger emotional experience than I thought it would be." ...|$|E
500|$|The road meanders through forest {{lands and}} fields as it {{continues}} northwesterly toward the Log Slide. This location gives motorists {{a chance to}} hike down to the lakeshore to see the Au Sable Point Lighthouse peeking above the trees {{to the east and}} the Grand Sable Dunes to the west. The American Motorcyclist Association said of this segment of the roadway that it is [...] "so close to the beach and lake that [...] can smell it when [...] rides." [...] The lighthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and can be accessed from the Hurricane River Campground. The roadway crosses the Hurricane River and turns southerly away from Lake Superior. H-58 turns back eastward near Grand Sable Lake, running between the north shore of the lake and the Grand Sable Dunes on the south shore of Lake Superior. At the intersection with William Hill and Newburg roads, H-58 makes a 90° curve and travels northward for about three-quarters of a mile (1.2km). The road turns back eastward next to the Sable Falls parking lot. This lot also marks the eastern end of the segment of H-58 that road crews do not plow. The roadway exits the national park and runs to the community of Grand Marais. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> is the Woodland Township Park where hikers can walk along the beach {{to the base of the}} Grand Sable Dunes that form the east end of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore.
