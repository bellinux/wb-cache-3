50|$|The {{southern}} red bishop or red bishop (Euplectes orix) {{is a small}} passerine bird {{belonging to}} the bishop and widowbird genus Euplectes in the weaver family, the Ploceidae.

40|$|New in this Seasonal Report, {{direct from}} the American Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union (along with Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Snipe, Rock Pigeon, etc.), is the {{modified}} checklist order, featuring geese, swans, and ducks at the beginning, followed by gallinaceous birds, then resuming the familiar order with loons. Perhaps {{the most important}} use for these reports, {{in addition to their}} incorporation into the Southern Great Plains Region summary in North American Birds, is the noting of significant avian events in Nebraska. Some are of obvious importance, but the meaning of others is obscure, perhaps only to be revealed as subsequent reports show a trend, or events noted in Nebraska are corroborated by the same events noted in the other Southern Great Plains states, in Kansas and Oklahoma, or even on a national level. Such events discussed in this report include a good showing of scoters, hints of a recovery of the Gray Partridge population, a sighting of 7 + migrating Mississippi Kites, a Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker in Sowbelly Canyon, indications of declines in numbers of Black-billed Magpie, American Crow, and Black-capped Chickadee, westerly Carolina Wrens, rather low numbers of thrushes and warblers, westerly Rose-breasted Grosbeaks possibly breeding, good numbers of Purple Finches, no reports of Red Crossbills after 27 Sep, and few Pine Siskins. A similar category of events, but perhaps better labeled 2 ̆ 2 quirky, 2 ̆ 2 were some strange bobwhite items from the Panhandle, the occurrence of Eurasian Collared-Doves in 74 counties so far, the possibility that the Curve-billed Thrasher at the Frimann Ranch in Sioux County was able to sneak its genes into the Brown Thrasher pool, a Blue Grosbeak carrying a minnow, and an <b>Orange</b> <b>Bishop</b> (a bird, not a Dutch prelate) in Kearney. Among significant early or late dates of occurrence were record late Caspian Terns, Panhandle Gray Catbird, and Bobolink (although the Boblink was unsubstantiated), second-latest Forster 2 ̆ 7 s Tern and Western Kingbird, and record early Northern (Red-Shafted) Flickers eastward. In-your-face numbers were the 321 Hooded Mergansers at L Yankton, 5 Yellow-crowned Night-Herons in the eastern Rainwater Basin, a fall record 247 Upland Sandpipers there also, an almost-record 283 Buff-breasted Sandpipers also in the eastern Rainwater Basin, 26, 000 Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s Gulls at L McConaughy, a record 14 Caspian Terns at Branched Oak L, 30 + Burrowing Owls at a Scotts Bluff County location, and a record 12 Brown Creepers at Arbor Day Farm. And for rarity buffs and state listers, there was limited joy this fall. Best were the 3 rd state record Yellow-billed Loon at L McConaughy and 5 th state record Tricolored Heron in the eastern Rainwater Basin. Significant also was a 3 rd state fall record Hudsonian Godwit, at L McConaughy. Important Panhandle records were a first record Summer Tanager (of the western subspecies cooperi), 2 nd record Ruby-throated Hummingbird (as well as a 2 nd record Archilochus hummingbird), 2 nd record Winter Wren, first fall record Baltimore Oriole, 2 nd fall record Mourning Warbler, and 3 rd fall record Rose-breasted Grosbeak, a male. Other important records were a Tufted Titmouse at Ponca SP, apparently the same bird that was there in May, and the 8 th fall record Rock Wren in the southeast...|$|E

50|$|When James VII {{fled the}} country in 1688 and the crown was offered jointly to his {{daughter}} Mary and her husband William of <b>Orange,</b> the Scottish <b>bishops</b> felt that, since James VII had not actually abdicated, {{they were unable to}} take the oath of allegiance to William and Mary. In consequence, the national Church of Scotland was established in the presbyterian form, and the non-juring bishops and those loyal to them became a persecuted minority who were regarded as potential traitors.|$|R

5000|$|Seely {{attempted}} {{to get the}} incoming settlers to stay {{on one side of}} the creek or the other, but they failed to heed him. Ultimately, two settlements about four miles apart developed, one on the northwest side of the creek, the other on the southeast, and the settlers decided that each should have a name. A real misunderstanding arose. [...] "Some contended that the lower town, now Castle Dale, should have been Orangeville because it was the home of <b>Bishop</b> <b>Orange</b> Seely, in whose honor the name was suggested by Erastus Snow, and Orangeville should have retained the original name of Castle Dale because the settlers first located there. A friendly rivalry soon sprang up. Orangeville people were dubbed 'Skillet Lickers,' because molasses was made there, while the Castle Dale people were called 'Woodenshoes' implying that Danes had settled there." ...|$|R
40|$|At least 10 {{species of}} parrots (Family Psittacidae), {{along with the}} Eurasian Collared-Dove (Columbidae: Streptopelia decaocto), <b>Orange</b> [Northern Red] <b>Bishop</b> (Ploceidae: Euplectes frandscanus), and Nutmeg Mannikin [2 ̆ 2 Spice Finch 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Spotted Munia 2 ̆ 2] (Estrildidae: Lonchura punctulata), have {{recently}} established significant viable and generally increasing populations in California. Populations {{of all of these}} taxa are concentrated in highly modified urban and suburban habitats (parrots, doves) or in flood control basins and river channels with abundant rank annual growth (bishop, mannikin). With various collaborators, the author has monitored these taxa in southern California through the 1990 s. Because of the potential for deleterious ecological interactions with native bird species and for damage to certain commercial crops, monitoring of these species and other potentially established exotic bird species must be ongoing. Here the author reports his present knowledge of population sizes and trends, geographical distribution, habitat relationships, and foraging and breeding ecology of these introduced species and suggest schemes for continued monitoring...|$|R
