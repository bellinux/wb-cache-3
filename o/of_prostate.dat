40|$|Accurate {{analysis}} of the correlation between deformation <b>of</b> the <b>prostate</b> and displacement <b>of</b> its center of gravity (CoG) is important for efficient radiation therapy for prostate cancer. In this study, we addressed this problem by introducing a new analysis approach. A planning computed tomography (CT) scan and 7 repeat cone-beam CT scans {{during the course of}} treatment were obtained for 19 prostate cancer patients who underwent three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy. A single observer contoured the prostate gland only. To evaluate the local deformation <b>of</b> the <b>prostate,</b> it was divided into 12 manually defined segments. Prostate deformation was calculated using in-house developed software. The correlation between the displacement of the CoG and the local deformation <b>of</b> the <b>prostate</b> was evaluated using multiple regression analysis. The mean value and standard deviation (SD) <b>of</b> the <b>prostate</b> deformation were 0. 6 mm and 1. 7 mm, respectively. For the majority of the patients, the local SD of the deformation was slightly lager in the superior and inferior segments. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the anterior-posterior displacement of the CoG <b>of</b> the <b>prostate</b> had a highly significant correlation with the deformations in the middle-anterior (p < 0. 01) and middle-posterior (p < 0. 01) segments <b>of</b> the <b>prostate</b> surface (R 2 = 0. 84). However, there was no significant correlation between the displacement of the CoG and the deformation <b>of</b> the <b>prostate</b> surface in other segments. Anterior-posterior displacement of the CoG <b>of</b> the <b>prostate</b> is highly correlated with deformation in its middle-anterior and posterior segments. In the radiation therapy for prostate cancer, it is necessary to optimize the internal margin for every position <b>of</b> the <b>prostate</b> measured using image-guided radiation therapy...|$|R

25|$|The {{data on the}} {{relationship}} between diet and prostate cancer is poor. In light of this the rate <b>of</b> <b>prostate</b> cancer is linked to the consumption of the Western diet. There is little if any evidence to support an association between trans fat, saturated fat and carbohydrate intake and risk <b>of</b> <b>prostate</b> cancer. Evidence regarding the role of omega-3 fatty acids in preventing prostate cancer does not suggest that they reduce the risk <b>of</b> <b>prostate</b> cancer, although additional research is needed. Vitamin supplements appear to have no effect and some may increase the risk. High calcium intake has been linked to advanced prostate cancer. Consuming fish may lower prostate cancer deaths but does not appear to affect its occurrence. Some evidence supports lower rates <b>of</b> <b>prostate</b> cancer with a vegetarian diet. There is some tentative evidence for foods containing lycopene and selenium. Diets rich in cruciferous vegetables, soy, beans and other legumes may be associated with a lower risk <b>of</b> <b>prostate</b> cancer, especially more advanced cancers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mouse {{models for}} {{treatment}} <b>of</b> late-stage <b>prostate</b> cancer are valuable tools, but assessing {{the extent of}} growth <b>of</b> the <b>prostate</b> and particularly its regression due to therapeutic intervention or castration is difficult due to the location, small size and interdigitated anatomy <b>of</b> the <b>prostate</b> gland in situ. Temporal monitoring <b>of</b> mouse <b>prostate</b> regression requires multiple animals and examination of histological sections. Methods Initially, T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on normal year-old C 57 /BL 6 mice. Individual mice were repeatedly imaged using inhalation anesthesia to establish the reproducibility of the method and to follow hormone manipulation <b>of</b> the <b>prostate</b> volume. Subsequently, MRI fat signal was suppressed using a chemical shift-selective (CHESS) pulse to avoid signal contamination and enhance discrimination <b>of</b> the <b>prostate.</b> Results High field (7 T) MRI provides high resolution (117 × 117 μm in plane), highly reproducible images of the normal mouse prostate. Despite long imaging times, animals can be imaged repeatedly to establish reliability <b>of</b> volume measurements. <b>Prostate</b> volume declines following castration and subsequently returns to normal with androgen administration in the same animal. CHESS imaging allowed discrimination of both the margins <b>of</b> the <b>prostate</b> and the dorsal-lateral lobes <b>of</b> the <b>prostate</b> (DLP) from the ventral lobes (VP). Castration results in a 40 % reduction in {{the volume of the}} DLP and a 75 % reduction in the volume of the VP. Conclusion MRI assessment of the volume <b>of</b> the mouse <b>prostate</b> is precise and reproducible. MRI improves volumetric determination of the extent of regression and monitoring of the same mouse over time during the course of treatment is possible. Since assessing groups of animals at each time point is avoided, this improves the accuracy of the measurement of any manipulation effect and reduces the number of animals required. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Focal therapy <b>of</b> the <b>{{prostate}}</b> {{is defined}} as prostate gland ablation aiming at eradication <b>of</b> unifocal low-risk <b>prostate</b> cancer, and preserving uninvolved (peri-) prostatic tissue and therefore quality of life. The major arguments against focal therapy can be classified under the headings of understaging and multifocality. The argument of understaging {{highlights the importance of}} the occasional, but troublesome, finding of a large, extraprostatic or high-grade tumor (Gleason score ≥ 7) in about a quarter of radical prostatectomy specimens removed from men initially classified as having a low-risk tumor. Indeed, 85 % <b>of</b> all <b>prostate</b> cancer cases are multifocal.
