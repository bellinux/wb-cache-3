2500|$|During {{a period}} of the game's history when betting and match-fixing was rife, Beldham was not immune to the lure of easy money. When interviewed by Pycroft in the late 1830s, he said: [...] "You may hear that I sold matches. I will confess I once was sold myself by two men, one of whom would not bowl, and the other would not bat, his best, and lost ten pounds. The next match, at Nottingham, I joined in selling, and got my money back. But for this <b>once,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say I never was bought {{in my life and}} this was not for want of offers from C and other turfmen, though often I must have been accused. For where it was worth while to buy, no man could keep a character; because to be out without runs or to miss a catch was, by the {{disappointed}} betting-men, deemed proof as strong as Holy Writ".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yours was {{a strong}} measure, and he won't like it. Be advised, Nuttie. Recollect your mother. The best way would be to go home at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get a day to take you--if you would start this afternoon.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{should like}} to know whether you {{consider}} yourselves American or English," [...] she broke out. [...] "If <b>once</b> <b>I</b> knew <b>I</b> <b>could</b> talk to you accordingly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's--whatever it is. I can't {{get over}} the thought of her. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> but now <b>I</b> see that I can't. It seems to grow worse. Sometimes I feel {{as if it would}} drive me crazy." ...|$|R
6000|$|Con. [alone]. Were <b>I</b> as <b>once</b> <b>I</b> was, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> revenge: But now all private grudges wane like mist In the keen {{sunlight}} of my full intent; And {{this man}} counts {{but for some}} sullen bull Who paws and mutters at unheeding pilgrims His empty wrath: yet let him bar my path, Or stay me but one hour in my life-purpose, And I will fell him as a savage beast, God's foe, not mine. Beware thyself, Sir Count! ...|$|R
6000|$|The old Gunga squatted {{close on}} his stool, and grinned as graciously as he could. [...] "I am poor and growing old," [...] he said, [...] "and I cannot catch fish as <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> How is that done, O Royal Traveller?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This ill {{company made}} me very miserable all the way. Only <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not but heartily laugh to see Fincher be sturdyly belaboured by {{five or six}} carmen with whips and prong staves for {{provoking}} them {{with some of his}} extravagant frolics." ...|$|E
60|$|When Sally got {{out alone}} with me {{she made me}} ride {{to keep her from}} disappearing somewhere on the horizon. This morning I wanted her to enjoy to the fullest her utter freedom and to feel that for <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not catch her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{and tell}} her so. Make her {{understand}} that she should put herself into my hands at <b>once,</b> and that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> protect her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, she would, sir. After you {{had gone}} up to the Hall yesterday, I went up to see her, as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not have asked you {{to let me go}} at <b>once,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not have found some one to take my place. She would be glad to come, sir; and I am sure she will suit you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} could be managed, landlord. I am a pretty good sailor, and {{there ought to be}} no great {{difficulty}} in getting hold of a boat and making out to sea and, when <b>once</b> away, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> steer for England, or get on board some vessel bound there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not always," [...] his Majesty {{was pleased}} to say, [...] "that we can do as we like; but I was glad when, for <b>once,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give myself that {{pleasure}} in your case, General; for my army contains no better officer as you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody," [...] he said, [...] "calls me {{to these}} mysteries--and he leaves me here to play {{horse-keeper}} and child-keeper at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> excuse the one, for I love a good horse naturally; {{but to be}} plagued with a bratchet whelp.--Whence come ye, my fair-favoured little gossip?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to know}} none," [...] Bill said positively. [...] "A missionary chap, he {{came and}} prayed with an old woman I lodged with <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not make head nor tail of it, and she died just the same, so you see what good did it do her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{blood of}} the slaves of despotism!" [...] he sternly {{interrupted}} her; [...] "the {{blood of the}} enemies of freedom! You have dwelt so long in this dull retirement, and you have cherished so blindly the prejudices of your youth, that the promise of those noble sentiments <b>I</b> <b>once</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see budding in Alice Dunscombe has not been fulfilled." ...|$|R
6000|$|To die--that {{does not}} disturb me; we {{of the service}} never care for death. But if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see her <b>once</b> more! if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear her bugle sing again and say, [...] "It is I, Soldier--come!" ...|$|R
50|$|A {{year later}} and Brett's career is going well, {{there is the}} {{possibility}} of a job in New York and popularity has gone to his head. Tash is still trying to write serious scientific articles for a paper more interested in gossip and sex and struggling to prevent her articles being buried on page 12. Their relationship is on the rocks. That night during a Valentine's boat trip on Sydney Harbour, an argument ensues and Brett decides he has had enough. Tash tells him: 'I wish you could be me, so you <b>could</b> see how <b>I</b> feel for <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be you, so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> show you what an idiot you've become!'.|$|R
6000|$|Before the {{man could}} reply a wailing cry came from the woman. She sprang past his detaining arm. [...] "Elwyn!" [...] she sobbed, and cast herself upon me, and clung tight. [...] "Elwyn," [...] she cried again, [...] "don't break my heart. I am your wife--call my name once--just <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see you dead rather than this way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My Dear Theodora,--I {{have decided}} to go home at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not rest without Theresa's explanation, so I have written to her, and I had rather have it by letter than in person. I talked till two o'clock last night with mamma, and we go home at twelve to-day. Tell Violet we will {{come in for a}} few moments to take leave.|$|E
6000|$|... "'It is {{absolutely}} essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have 50,000 pounds at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer {{to make it a}} matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one's self under obligations.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A mere jest!" [...] she said, in mournful astonishment. [...] "Can you jest when I am so wretchedly in earnest? Tell me the truth, Frank. I {{am not a}} fool, you know, {{although}} I am a woman, {{and have}} my woman's moments. Come! treat me fairly," [...] she said, looking honestly and fearlessly into his face. [...] "I don't want much; bare justice--that's all! Ah! <b>once</b> <b>I</b> felt <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be content with {{nothing less than the}} highest homage from the husband I should choose. Now, anything short of cruelty will content me. Yes! the independent and spirited Bathsheba is come to this!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} taken him before, at <b>once,</b> instantly, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have {{thought that it was}} so," [...] she said to herself; [...] "but this is a {{thousand}} times better." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>once</b> was by Fortune carest: [...] <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>could</b> {{relieve the}} distrest: [...] Now life's poor support, hardly earn'd [...] My fate will scarce bestow: [...] And it's O, fickle Fortune, O! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Next time we two meet, {{next time}} I hold you like this, {{it shall be}} on board. You and I, in the brig--all the world, all the life--" [...] And then he flashed out: [...] "I wonder I can wait! I feel as if I must carry you off now, at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> run with you in my hands- -down the path--without stumbling--without {{touching}} the earth--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me, mon ami, {{but you did}} not {{understand}} it in the least. I was {{trying to decide whether}} or not I would clear John Cavendish at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have cleared him--though it might have meant a failure to convict the real criminals. They were entirely in the dark as to my real attitude up to the very last moment--which partly accounts for my success." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good! I am the Holy One's cow.' This {{was pure}} Hinduism, but the lama never heeded. 'I am old. I have borne sons in the body. Oh, <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> please men! Now I can cure them.' He heard her armlets tinkle {{as though she}} bared arms for action. 'I will take over the boy and dose him, and stuff him, and make him all whole. Hai! hai! We old people know {{something}} yet.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Nod laughed. [...] "Then would I go on all fours, O Mishcha, for I am {{weary of}} waiting and being far from my brothers, Thumb and Thimble. Then would <b>I</b> go at <b>once</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> leave the Oomgar quietly to his hunting, and safe from this Shadow-beast and {{from more than}} three lean hunting leopards on the Ollaconda boughs at one time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'M. de Nid de Merle {{has been}} all the spring in Poland with the King,' said the minister, 'and the poor lady {{is thought to have}} perished at La Sablerie. Thus the danger has been less pressing, but I would have taken her to England at <b>once,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have made sure of her reception, and besides---' he faltered.|$|R
60|$|In truth, {{she was a}} being transformed, {{and more}} wondrous fair than ever. And even then I pictured her in the brave gowns and jewels I would buy her when times were mended, when our dear country would be free. All at <b>once,</b> ere <b>I</b> <b>could</b> draw a breath, she had stooped and kissed me ever so lightly on the forehead.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I think I {{can tell}} ye how to see rugged Scotland, {{for the country}} has two {{different}} sides. Ye can take your choice, but ye cannot see both at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> send ye by main roads, where the tourists' motors run, to the show-places, where ye would stay at smart hotels, with Swiss and London waiters, and learn as much o' Scottish character as ye would in Lucerne or the Strand." ...|$|E

60|$|Now as I spoke thus {{my heart}} bounded with hope, for if <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> come among the Spaniards, perhaps I might escape {{the altar of}} sacrifice. Also they seemed a link between me and home. They had sailed hither in ships, and ships can retrace their path. For though at present my lot was not all sorrow, it will be guessed that I should have been glad indeed to find myself once more among Christian men.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I thank God I did {{not write}} before,' she murmured, as she {{directed}} the letter. 'I might have ruined my life and his, for, <b>once</b> done, <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> have drawn back again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will," [...] he said, after awhile, [...] "this room is as {{stifling}} {{as it is}} dark. I feel as if I {{should be}} a sound man <b>once</b> more if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but get one snuff of the sea-breeze." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{came to me}} with a {{shock of}} an {{intellectual}} discovery. <b>I</b> saw at <b>once</b> how <b>I</b> <b>could</b> spread my system, or parts of it, all over the United States and Canada. To make education attractive! There it is! To call in the help of poetry, of music, of grand opera, if need be, to aid in the teaching of the dry subjects of the college class room.|$|R
