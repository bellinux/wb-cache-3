5|$|Groves and Conant {{were hoping}} to harness his {{industrial}} expertise {{for the benefit of}} the project. They offered him a post as a deputy to Robert Oppenheimer, at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, but he did not wish to move his family or give up his responsibilities at Monsanto. Instead he accepted the role of coordinating the plutonium purification and production work being carried out at Los Alamos, the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, Radiation laboratory in Berkeley, and Ames Laboratory in Iowa. Monsanto's Central Research Department began to conduct research on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project's Dayton Project, some of which was conducted on the estate of his wife's family.|$|E

5|$|In early 1944, Smyth {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of producing an unclassified report for the general public on the achievements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project. The director of the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, supported the idea. He arranged a meeting with James B.

Conant took up the matter with the Manhattan Project's director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr.. In April, Smyth received a formal letter from Groves asking him to write such a report. Both the report and the choice of Smyth as its author were approved by the Manhattan Project’s governing body, the Military Policy Committee, in May 1944.|$|E

5|$|A legacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project was {{the network}} of {{national}} laboratories, but none was located on the East Coast. Rabi and Ramsey assembled a group of universities in the New York area to lobby for their own national laboratory. When Zacharias, who was now at MIT, heard about it, {{he set up a}} rival group at MIT and Harvard. Rabi had discussions with Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project, who was willing to go along with a new national laboratory, but only one. Moreover, while the Manhattan Project still had funds, the wartime organization was expected to be phased out when a new authority came into existence. After some bargaining and lobbying by Rabi and others, the two groups came together in January 1946. Eventually nine universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Rochester and Yale) came together, and on 31 January 1947 a contract was signed with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which had replaced the Manhattan Project, that established the Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Army, Bachelder became a {{research}} chemist at the University of Chicago, {{where the first}} self-sustaining nuclear reaction had been achieved in 1942. Nobel Laureate James Franck had been Director of the Chemistry Division of the Metallurgical Laboratory during the earlier phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project. Bachelder joined the University's Institute for the Study of Metals (renamed as the James Franck Institute in 1967), and she conducted further research in metallochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Early {{research}} into the element was somewhat limited {{because most of the}} nuclear physicists and chemists in the United States at the time were focused on the massive effort to research the properties of plutonium as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project. Research into the element did continue as a minor part of the project and the first bulk sample of neptunium was isolated in 1944.|$|E

50|$|Expressways in <b>the</b> boroughs outside <b>Manhattan</b> {{had been}} planned but later canceled, {{including}} the Bushwick Expressway, an extension of Interstate 78 through Brooklyn and Queens that would run from the Williamsburg Bridge (at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lower <b>Manhattan</b> Expressway) to John F. Kennedy International Airport. Also, the Cross Brooklyn Expressway, a faster commercial route paralleling the Belt Parkway from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to John F. Kennedy International Airport, was canceled. The Bushwick was canceled largely due to <b>the</b> cancellation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lower <b>Manhattan</b> Expressway. For this reason, none of I-78's spur routes connect to I-78; the closest connection would {{have been made by}} Interstate 478 via the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel.|$|R
