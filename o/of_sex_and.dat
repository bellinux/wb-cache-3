5|$|David Mirkin {{conceived}} the initial {{idea for the}} episode, Steve O'Donnell was the lead writer, and Steven Dean Moore directed. The writers drew on many groups to develop the Movementarians, but were principally influenced by Scientology, Heaven's Gate, the Unification Church ("Moonies"), the Rajneesh movement, and Peoples Temple. The show contains many references to popular culture, including the title reference to The Joy <b>of</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>and</b> a gag involving Rover from the television program The Prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on which}} bones are present, sex can be {{determined}} by looking for distinctive sexual dimorphisms. When available, the pelvis is extremely useful in the determination <b>of</b> <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> when properly examined can achieve sex determination with a great level of accuracy. The examination of the pubic arch {{and the location of}} the sacrum can help determine sex.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis <b>of</b> <b>sex,</b> <b>and</b> are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{profound}} advances made over recent decades {{in our understanding}} of life's fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved. One of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function <b>of</b> <b>sex,</b> <b>and</b> particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and homologous recombination. One view is that sex evolved primarily as an adaptation that promoted increased genetic diversity (see references e.g.). An alternative view is that sex is an adaptation for promoting accurate DNA repair in germ-line DNA, and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that may be useful in the long run. (See also Evolution of sexual reproduction).|$|E
5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus <b>of</b> <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> gender in their research.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Jamie presents Dylan {{with the}} contract to sign so she can land her commission for recruiting him. Not knowing {{anyone else in the}} city, he and Jamie quickly develop a strong platonic friendship. One night, they get on the topic <b>of</b> <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> relationships. They {{come to the conclusion that}} sex should not come with so many emotional attachments. As they both feel the need for a physical connection, they agree to have sex without emotion or commitment. After several trysts together, Jamie comes to the realization that this is not really what she wants and she would like to start dating again. She tells Dylan that they need to stop.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services, and counselled {{more than 800}} women in the subsequent decade, 97% of whom wrote on their intake surveys {{that they wanted to}} exit the sex industry. In order to make this statistic more widely known, Falle founded Sex Trade 101. She began offering training for police and partners with the Toronto Police Service's sex crimes unit. Falle {{was one of the main}} proponents of Member of Parliament (MP) Joy Smith's private member's bill, Bill C-268, which was passed in June 2010 as An Act to amend the Criminal Code (minimum sentence for offences involving trafficking of persons under the age of eighteen years), and she helped the Canadian government formulate their appeal of the decision of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Bedford v. Canada to strike down various prostitution laws. Falle advocates adopting a law in Canada analogous to Sweden's Sex Purchase Act, which would decriminalize the selling <b>of</b> <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> criminalize the purchasing of sex.|$|E
