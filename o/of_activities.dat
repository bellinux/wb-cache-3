40|$|OBJECTIVE: Avoidance <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> is {{hypothesized}} {{to lead to}} muscle weakness and consequently, to physical disability. This study was undertaken to validate the avoidance model by providing evidence for the mediating role of muscle weakness {{in the relationship between}} avoidance <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> and physical disability in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. METHODS: Data on avoidance <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> observed physical disability, and muscle strength of the knee in 107 patients with knee OA were analyzed. A series of regression analyses was performed to establish the mediating role of muscle weakness. First, the effect <b>of</b> avoidance <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> on the level of disability was assessed. Next, the relationship between avoidance <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> and muscle strength was established. Finally, the mediating role of muscle strength could be established if the effect <b>of</b> avoidance <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> on disability decreased when muscle strength was taken into account. RESULTS: Initially, avoidance <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> accounted for 21. 5 % of variance in disability. Avoidance <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> also accounted for 3. 9 % of variance in muscle strength. After muscle strength was taken into account, the variance in disability accounted for by avoidance <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> was reduced from 21. 5 % to 15. 7 %. Thus, the criteria for establishing the mediating role of muscle strength were met. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide evidence for the mediating role of muscle weakness in the relationship between avoidance <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> and disability in patients with knee OA.
