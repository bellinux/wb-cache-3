5|$|A 1926 {{graduate}} of the United States Naval Academy, Mumma served {{on a number of}} warships. He studied marine engineering at the L'École Nationale Supérieure de Maritime in Paris, where he learned the latest techniques of maritime construction. During World War II he served at the David Taylor Model Basin, where he investigated problems of propeller design. In January 1943, he took over the Propeller desk at the Bureau of Ships. He joined the Alsos Mission in 1944, and in the last days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> part of a 75-man task force that captured the city of Kiel, including the whole garrison of 150,000 men.|$|E
5|$|After Grant's army {{slipped past}} Lee's army {{to cross the}} James River, Hancock {{found himself in a}} {{position}} from which he might have ended the war. His corps arrived to support William Farrar Smith's assaults on the lightly held Petersburg defensive lines, but he deferred to Smith's advice because Smith knew the ground and had been on the field all day, and no significant assaults were made before the Confederate lines were reinforced. One of the great opportunities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> lost. After his corps participated in the assaults at Deep Bottom, Hancock was promoted to brigadier general in the regular army, effective August 12, 1864.|$|E
5|$|During 1803–06 the Third Coalition {{fought the}} First French Empire and its client states (see table at right). Although several naval battles {{determined}} {{control of the}} seas, the outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> decided on the continent, predominantly in two major land operations in the Danube valley: the Ulm campaign in the upper Danube and the Vienna campaign, in the middle Danube valley.|$|E

5|$|During the American Civil War, Mobile was a Confederate city. The H. L. Hunley, {{the first}} {{submarine}} to sink an enemy ship, {{was built in}} Mobile. One {{of the most famous}} naval engagements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> the Battle of Mobile Bay, resulting in the Union taking control of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864. On April 12, 1865, three days after Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse, the city surrendered to the Union army to avoid destruction after Union victories at nearby Spanish Fort and Fort Blakely.|$|E
5|$|For medieval writers, the {{two most}} {{influential}} ancient sources on the Trojan War were the purported eye-witness accounts of Dares the Phrygian, and Dictys the Cretan, which both survive in Latin versions. In Western Europe the Trojan side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> favoured and therefore Dares was preferred over Dictys. Although Dictys' account positions Troilus' death later in the war than was traditional, it conforms to antiquity's view {{of him as a}} minor warrior if one at all. Dares' De excidio Trojae historia (History of the Fall of Troy) introduces the character as a hero who takes part in events beyond the story of his death.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the war, {{large numbers of}} public memorials were erected {{around the country in}} memory of Belgian soldiers who had died fighting for the Allied cause during the conflict. There are numerous monuments and streets dedicated to Allied politicians and generals, including Franklin Roosevelt and Bernard Montgomery in Brussels. The large numbers of British and American cemeteries and memorials, particularly in the Ardennes region associated with the Battle of the Bulge, meant that the legacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> very visible.|$|E

5|$|On 10 July 1651, {{the first}} {{significant}} naval battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> fought south of Naxos, a three-day engagement in which the Venetians with 58 ships under Alvise Mocenigo were victorious over the twice as large Ottoman fleet. The remainders of the Ottoman fleet withdrew to Rhodes, from where they were however able to reach Candia. Mocenigo was replaced soon after by Leonardo Foscolo, but both sides did not accomplish much {{in the next two}} years, although the Ottomans did succeed in supplying their forces on Crete while keeping their fleet intact.|$|E
5|$|On {{the whole}} Australian {{commerce}} was expanded {{due to the}} war, although the cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> quite considerable and the Australian government had to borrow considerably from overseas to fund the war effort. In terms of value, Australian exports rose almost 45 per cent, {{while the number of}} Australians employed in the manufacturing industry increased over 11 per cent. This was due in the most part to the reduced ability of traditional sources to continue supplying Australia with manufactured products, which out of necessity stimulated the development of the Australian manufacturing industry.|$|E
5|$|Rear Admiral Leonard Warren Murray, CB, CBE (22 June 1896 – 25 November 1971) was {{an officer}} of the Royal Canadian Navy who played a {{significant}} role in the Battle of the Atlantic. He commanded the Newfoundland Escort Force from 1941–1943, and from 1943 to the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> Commander-in-Chief, Canadian Northwest Atlantic. He was the only Canadian to command an Allied theatre of operations during World War I or World War II.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Navy at {{the start}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> the largest navy in the world due, for the most part, to the Naval Defence Act 1889 and the two-power {{standard}} which called for the navy to maintain a number of battleships such as their strength was at least equal to the combined strength {{of the next two}} largest navies in the world, which at that point were France and Russia.|$|E
5|$|The first naval {{operation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> {{in support}} of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force during the occupation of German New Guinea.

The only loss during the New Guinea Campaign occurred when the AE1 disappeared on 14 September 1914, taking three officers and 32 men with it.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> precise origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>are</b> {{unknown to}} readers.

A few major events in <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>are</b> mentioned, such as the Harmony Raid, the most successful Coalition raid upon a rev position, which required nearly a year <b>of</b> build-up in <b>the</b> outskirts <b>of</b> a rev system due to translation inaccuracies.|$|R

5|$|The growing Polish-Soviet tension was {{beginning}} to strain Western-Soviet relations {{at a time when}} the Poles' importance to the Allies, significant in the first years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>was</b> beginning to fade, due to the entry into the conflict of the military and industrial giants, the Soviet Union and the United States. In retrospective review of records, both British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt were increasingly torn between their commitments to their Polish ally and the demands by Stalin and his diplomats.|$|E
5|$|The outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> a {{complete}} Byzantine victory, and Tzimiskes {{decided to take}} full advantage. Although he initially recognized Boris II as the legitimate Bulgarian tsar, {{after the fall of}} Dorostolon his intentions changed. This became evident during his triumphal return to Constantinople, where the emperor entered the Golden Gate behind a wagon carrying an icon of the Virgin Mary as well as the Bulgarian regalia, with Boris and his family following behind Tzimiskes. When the procession reached the Forum of Constantine, Boris was publicly divested of his imperial insignia, and at the church of Hagia Sophia, the Bulgarian crown was dedicated to God.|$|E

Upon the armistice the full {{details of his}} Victoria Cross action were revealed and, in 1919, he was mentioned in despatches {{in recognition of the}} service he had performed during the Q-ship operations. As further recognition of his overall efforts against the German submarine campaign, the French government presented him with the Croix de Guerre.|$|E

5|$|The ships' {{anti-aircraft}} batteries were {{revised and}} improved {{throughout the course}} of their careers. The original single-mounted 8.8cm guns were replaced with twin mounts for the new 8.8 cm SK C/32 guns and a third twin mount was also installed, bringing the number of guns to six. Eight 3.7 cm SK C/30 guns were installed in the mid-1930s and up to eight 2 cm Flak 30 guns were also added. Köln, the only ship to survive to the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>was</b> ultimately armed with eight 3.7cm and eighteen 2cm guns, though provisions had been made to mount up to ten and twenty-four guns of the two calibers, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Appointed to second-in-command of the battalion, Hargest was {{involved}} in the preliminary planning for the Battle of Messines in June 1917. He carried out vital reconnaissance of the German front lines, penetrating the enemy communication trenches in the lead up to the battle. During the German Spring Offensive, launched in March 1918, he was made acting battalion commander. In September 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of the 2nd Battalion, Otago Infantry Regiment. He participated in the last offensive action of the war involving the New Zealand Division when on 4 November 1918, his battalion attacked Germans positioned in a fortified house in the Mormal Forest. Having captured the house, it was made his temporary headquarters. It later received a direct hit from artillery fire and Hargest was fortunate to escape unhurt. His leadership of his battalion during the last few months <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> recognised with an appointment to the Distinguished Service Order, a mention in despatches and the French Legion of Honour. In the immediate postwar period, he remained in command of his battalion while it performed occupation duties in Cologne until his departure to England on 4 February 1919.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} on 28 April or 29 April, General Gotthard Heinrici, Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula, was {{relieved}} of his command after disobeying Hitler's direct orders to hold Berlin {{at all costs}} and never order a retreat, {{and was replaced by}} General Kurt Student. General Kurt von Tippelskirch was named as Heinrici's interim replacement until Student could arrive and assume control. There remains some confusion as to who was in command, as some references say that Student was captured by the British and never arrived. Regardless of whether von Tippelskirch or Student was in command of Army Group Vistula, the rapidly deteriorating situation that the Germans faced meant that Army Group Vistula coordination of the armies under its nominal command during the last few days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> of little significance.|$|E
