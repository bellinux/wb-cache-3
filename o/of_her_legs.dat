Arisa awakens from her coma, but pretends to have amnesia and returns to Midori's side. She reveals {{that she was the}} original King: although she granted harmless wishes in the beginning, she eventually stole the answers to an exam for Mariko's wish, fearing disappointment if she refused. Midori caught her in the act, and she shared the task of granting the class's wishes with him, until he injured her mother, in an attempt to grant her wish. Midori then replaced her as King, using violence and bullying to grant wishes. Horrified by his cruelty and the perceived similarities between them, she then reached out to her twin, hoping that Tsubasa would be able to uncover the truth. Tsubasa learns that Midori suffered psychological trauma in his childhood after being abandoned by his mother and witnessing his twin, Akari, die of neglect. She later foils his attempt to kill her mother, as he hated his own mother and believed that Arisa hated hers as well. Arisa confesses that she loves him for noticing her loneliness, and he realizes that he loves her too. In the conclusion, Arisa's mother spends more time with her, and Arisa reconciles with Tsubasa.|$|E

25|$|A {{receiving}} woman's {{legs and}} arms are generally free to move about, though her position and movement may be constrained by the penetrating partner's weight and in some other way. A woman can adjust the position <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> for comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the Kearney attack, there were half a dozen similar attacks (See table), though none of the purported victims were able to provide a clear description of the prowler, and no clues were found {{at the scene of}} the attacks. The first specimen of physical evidence was found on the night of September 5, when Carl and Beulah Cordes of North 21st Street returned home around 10:00 pm. After spending a few minutes in the house they noticed a piece of white cloth, slightly larger than a man's handkerchief, sitting on their porch next to the screen door. Beulah Cordes picked up the cloth and smelled it. As soon as she inhaled, she became violently ill. She described the effect as being similar to an electric shock. Her face quickly began to swell, she experienced a burning sensation in her mouth and throat, and began to vomit. As with other victims, she also reported feeling weak and experiencing partial paralysis <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs.</b> Beulah Cordes later hypothesized that the cloth had been left on the porch in order to knock out the family dog, which usually slept there, so that the prowler could gain access to the house unnoticed.|$|E

500|$|In her video series Tropes vs. Women in Video Games (2013–2017), feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian criticises Resident Evil for sexualising its {{alternate}} costumes for women, citing as {{an example}} Valentine's pirate costume in the game Resident Evil: Revelations (2012).

Valentine's first appearance in the film Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) is <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> in a miniskirt, and the camera frequently follows her from behind. Commentators have noted that her body shape is unrealistic and does not reflect her physical training, and she was the only member of her team in the original game not to wear a bulletproof vest.

In Scott Snyder's Black Mirror storyline, Barbara Gordon is kidnapped by her brother, James Gordon Jr., who had returned to Gotham after a lengthy absence to become a serial killer.

500|$|Paramount's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) {{played to}} the Freudian {{theories}} {{popular with the}} audience of its time. Fredric March played the split-personality title character. Jekyll represented the composed super-ego, and Hyde the lecherous id. Miriam Hopkins's coquettish [...] bar singer, Ivy Pierson, sexually teases Jekyll early in the film by displaying parts <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> and bosom. Joy felt the scene had been [...] "dragged in simply to titillate the audience." [...] Hyde coerces her {{with the threat of}} violence into becoming his paramour and beats her when she attempts to stop seeing him. She is contrasted with his wholesome fiancée Muriel (Rose Hobart), whose chaste nature dissatisfies March's baser alter ego. The film is considered the [...] "most honored of the Pre-Code horror films." [...] Many of the graphic scenes between Hyde and Ivy were cut by local censors because of their suggestiveness. Sex was intimately tied to horror in many pre-Code horror movies. In Murders in the Rue Morgue, an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's classic tale which has little in common with the source material, Bela Lugosi plays a mad scientist who tortures and kills women, trying to mix human blood with ape blood during his experiments.

500|$|Dina Meyer starred as Barbara Gordon in the {{television}} series Birds of Prey (2002). It became the first adaptation to show the character's progression from Batgirl to Oracle, which included her paralysis {{at the hands of}} the Joker. Meyer commented on her character's complex history stating: [...] "She's multidimensional. She was a former superhero. She was extremely active physically for years, fighting alongside Batman. The unfortunate incident with the Joker took away the use <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs...</b> but rather than give up and throw in the towel, as she could've done so easily, she went and studied escrima (a martial art), got stronger in her mental state and, while helping out her father on a case one day, realized she had a knack for solving mysteries. And all of a sudden she became this computer genius." [...] Overall, the series received criticism for its emphasis on aesthetics over plot. It aired for one season before receiving cancellation. In the fourth season of the TV series Arrow, after Felicity Smoak suffered a similar paralyzing injury, Oliver Queen gives her the codename Overwatch while commenting that [...] "Oracle" [...] was taken. Although, in the comic books Barbara Gordon was never a member of the Teen Titans she was slated to appear in the live-action Titans series for TNT. This version of the character will be a wheelchair-bound computer expert, but will not yet be known as Oracle. This series has since been abanndoned ...|$|E
