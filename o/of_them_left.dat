25|$|By the mid 1900s, after Mexico {{started to}} {{industrialize}} and modernize, {{the consumption of}} pulque and the popularity of pulquerias had greatly declined. This {{is directly related to}} the increase in production and popularity of beer in Mexico. As factories established themselves and migrant workers started to come into Mexico, the beer industry greatly expand and beer soon replaced pulque as the alcoholic drink of choice. The popularity of pulquerias declined as they were seen as a thing of the past. By the 1930s, there was a steep reduction in the number of pulquerias in Mexico City, and today there are very few <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>left.</b>|$|E

Their shops, possessions and money were confiscated and all Jewish employees were fired. They were not allowed inside public buildings or to keep pets. Up until 15 October 1941, a further 1,500 Jews left {{the country on the}} orders of the authorities. The Gestapo accompanied them to France and Spain but, since they were rejected there, they went on an endless odyssey.|$|E
25|$|The {{chassis built}} by TVR were all {{provided}} to customer specification, and therefore no two <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>left</b> the factory {{in exactly the}} same configuration. The extra exposure created by using the Sports Saloon in competition led to potential customers inquiring about the availability of other body styles. TVR sold kits with Microplas Mistal bodies, and at least two different styles from Rochdale Motor Panels & Engineering Ltd. The engines fitted were typically the Ford 1172cc sidevalve or Austin A40 1200cc OHV. There was at least one instance of a car being fitted with the 1489cc BMC B-Series engine (as fitted to the MGA), and one chassis was built to accommodate a customer's 2½-litre Lea-Francis engine.|$|E

Their children were raised in areas where English was the majority language and consequently they did not learn to speak Spanish.|$|E
25|$|Jack Johnson, {{the heavyweight}} champion, and Battling Jim Johnson, another colored pugilist, of Galveston, Texas, {{met in a}} 10-round contest here tonight, which ended in a draw. The spectators loudly protested {{throughout}} that the men were not fighting, and demanded their money back. Many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>left</b> the hall. The organizers of the fight explained the fiasco by asserting that Jack Johnson's left arm was broken in the third round. There is no confirmation of a report that Jack Johnson had been stabbed and no evidence at the ringside of such an accident. During the first three rounds he was obviously playing with his opponent. After that {{it was observed that}} he was only using his right hand. When the fight was over he complained that his arm had been injured. Doctors who made an examination, certified to a slight fracture of the radius of the left arm. The general opinion is that his arm was injured in a wrestling match early in the week, and that a blow tonight caused the fracture of the bone.|$|E
25|$|Despite this new-found freedom, however, {{it meant}} that the {{numerous}} economical benefits and patronage, which {{was a part of}} the traditional clan system, were abolished along with it. Because of this the numerous menkyo holders of SMR who had depended on the old system for financial support had no choice but to adapt themselves to this new Japan. Many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>left</b> the traditional clan holdings, where their ancestors had lived for centuries, and made new lives and livelihoods for themselves. The final abolishment of the warrior-caste and the feudal-system also led to a rapid modernisation of Japan. During this era many of the old bushi (Samurai warriors of all ranks) had no choice but to abandon the old (and considered by most of the Japanese population of the time to be all but obsolete) martial arts altogether. Throughout Japan most of the surviving traditions were kept alive, if only barely, by the former samurai and other enthusiastic individuals, the former which now had to find a new place (and a new source of income) in the new Japan which frowned upon the old samurai way. Some of the old ryū, who were not as dependent on old samurai government sponsorship as others, fared better than others in the transition from samurai to the Western-style government.|$|E
