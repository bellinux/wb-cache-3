5|$|Western artists often infused Euro-American {{characteristics}} in their depictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> of Polynesia and possibly many actually depicted the pet dogs kept on European ships rather than native breeds. This resulted in few accurate depictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> surviving. A few works likely depicting the aboriginal dog breed done by Parkinson, Webber, Alexander Buchan and John Frederick Miller were compiled by American anthropologist Katharine Luomala including the two images above.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{contains}} several cultural {{references and}} allusions.

40|$|The thesis {{was focused}} on canine {{interactions}} in public spaces. One hundred canine dyads was observed. <b>The</b> gender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> affected to stop <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> before <b>the</b> meeting. <b>The</b> gender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> affected <b>the</b> initiation <b>of</b> sniffing. <b>The</b> gender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> and owner {{had an effect on}} <b>the</b> first location <b>of</b> sniffing. <b>The</b> gender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> had an effect on <b>the</b> last location <b>of</b> sniffing. <b>The</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> and use <b>of</b> leash had an effect on canine play. In conclusion, the results indicate that canine interactions are influenced by a number of factors...|$|R

5|$|A droving dog was needed, but {{the colonial}} working dogs are {{understood}} {{to have been}} of the Old English Sheepdog type, {{commonly referred to as}} Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.|$|E
5|$|Black {{rushes to}} Beebe's home, knowing the dogs will attack it. Beebe refuses to leave, {{but the house}} has been {{surrounded}} by five dogs; as they are killed they are seemingly endlessly replaced by others. The Old Man arrives, and insists {{the only way to}} rid the town <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> is burn down Beebe's house, which the trio do before fleeing. Back home in Seattle, Black refuses to sell his own home, telling his wife that they will move back into it together when their problems are resolved.|$|E
5|$|Modern hare {{coursing}} is practiced using {{a number of}} sighthounds: mainly greyhounds but also Borzois, Salukis, Whippets, and Deerhounds that are registered with a governing body such as the National Coursing Club or Kennel Club in Great Britain, the Irish Coursing Club, or the National Open Field Coursing Association (NOFCA) in the US. Events are conducted through local coursing clubs which are regulated by their governing body. The objective of legal formal coursing is to test and judge the athletic ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> rather than to kill the hare.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis was {{observation}} {{of communication between}} dogs in open spaces in Brno. Eighty six dyads were observed. The pause before meeting was affected by <b>the</b> sex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog.</b> Behavior during sniffing {{was influenced by the}} age and sex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog.</b> <b>The</b> last sniffing place was affected by <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog.</b> Play was influenced by <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a leash. <b>The</b> urination was affected by <b>the</b> sex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog.</b> Results suggest that canine communication is affected by many factors...|$|R
5|$|Princess Elizabeth {{was then}} given a Pembroke Corgi of her own, named Susan, for her 18th {{birthday}} in 1944. She {{had a strong}} connection to the dog, which was hidden under rugs in the Royal Carriage following her wedding to Prince Philip. Susan became the progenitor of all the Corgis owned by the Royal Household since. The Queen has bred ten generations of dogs from Susan, owning personally more than 30 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> which were either pure-bred Pembroke Welsh Corgis or crossbreed Corgi/Dachshunds called Dorgis.|$|E
5|$|On a cold October day, the Mistress {{falls into}} the lake and {{develops}} pneumonia. As the house must be kept quiet during her recovery, the dogs are sent to a boarding kennel, except Lad who is ordered to keep quiet. One night a thief breaks into the house, hoping {{to take advantage of}} the absence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs.</b> After he climbs through a window, Lad silently attacks him. During the ensuing fight Lad is cut with a knife before sending the man crashing back through the window. The noise wakes the humans of the house and the thief is arrested. After Lad's wound is treated, he enjoys praise from the Mistress then travels some distance from home to enjoy a lengthy session of barking.|$|E
5|$|Kenneth {{takes some}} time off from his page duties to {{volunteer}} at an animal shelter. He claims his time on a pig farm {{will allow him to}} not emotionally connect with the dogs being held there, but he quickly names all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> and adopts the many dogs scheduled to be euthanized that day. Kenneth asks for someone at TGS to adopt the dogs and Tracy quickly brings them all to Liz's apartment to continue annoying her. Liz and Tracy go to Jack to finally resolve their conflict. Jack decides that, because Liz ruined Tracy's life with her book, Tracy should be given the right to ruin her life, and he orders Liz to sign over her life rights to Tracy. Jack tells Liz a story about an accident he had ice climbing, falling into a crevasse. He broke his leg and was unable to climb upwards to escape, but by going deeper down into the crevasse he found a path out. Liz applies this story to her situation with Tracy and stops resisting him, instead suggesting that Tracy make a pornographic film based on her life. Tracy agrees and moves out of Liz's apartment. In addition, Jenna and Liz resolve their issues when they see two adult stars acting out a scene of Jenna (Caitlin Fowler) and Liz (Savanna Samson) apologizing to one another.|$|E
