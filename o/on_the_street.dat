Distributed by noted indie label Caroline Records, Kids <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Street</b> wound up becoming the Daddies' then-most successful release, remaining on The Rockets Retail Sales Top Twenty for over seven months and eventually working its way onto Rolling Stones Alternative Charts.|$|E

A social learning model of adaptation and victimization <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> was hypothesized. Although the model was supported for both homeless adults and adolescents, it was more strongly supported for adolescents than adults, and for males than females regardless of age...|$|R

5|$|Oxford Street changed {{character}} from residential to retail {{towards the end}} of the 19th century. Drapers, cobblers and furniture stores began to appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> and were later expanded into the first department stores. Street vendors began to sell tourist souvenirs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> during this time. A plan of Oxford Street in Tallis's London Street Views, published in the late 1830s, remarks that almost all the street, save for the far western end, was primarily retail. John Lewis started in 1864 as a small shop at No.132, while Selfridges opened on 15 March 1909 at No.400. Most of the southern side of Oxford Street west of Davies Street was completely rebuilt between 1865 and 1890, allowing a more uniform freehold ownership. By the 1930s, the street was almost entirely retail, a position that remains today. However, unlike nearby streets such as Bond Street and Park Lane, there remained a seedy element including street traders and prostitutes. Aside from a number of fixed places <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> there are no provisions for selling licensed goods on Oxford Street. The advent of closed-circuit television has reduced the attraction of the area to scam artists and illegal street traders.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{effects of}} daily abuse and {{hardship}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> lead to poor mental health in children living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> resulting in them choosing ineffective and self-destructive coping strategies that impact their physical health and overall sense of wellbeing. The facilitation {{of the mental}} health of children living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> who are subjected to daily threats to their survival is thus crucial. Objectives: The aim of this research was to explore and describe the lived experiences of children living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Hillbrow, Johannesburg. Method: The research design was qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual. A purposive sample was selected through a temporary shelter in Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa and consisted of 14 male children living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Data were collected using drawings, in-depth phenomenological interviews and field notes. The central interview opening statement was: ‘Tell me about your life <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street’. Results: The results obtained indicated that children living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> are threatened, exploited and exposed to physical, sexual and emotional abuse on a daily basis by the community, the authorities and other street dwellers. This leads to feelings of sadness, fear, anxiety, misery, despair, hopelessness, helplessness and suicide ideation, which in turn lead to drug abuse and criminal activities. In contrast, positive feelings of sympathy for other children living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> emerged and these children also displayed perseverance, resilience and a striving for autonomy. Conclusion: Street life exposes children to a variety of experiences, both positive and negative.  A striving after autonomy is clearly depicted by these children, who are able to tap into a range of responses, both on- and off-street. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} I use Foucault’s theory {{of power to}} explain children’s {{presence}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> I argue that resistance to be subject of family power and to be subject of the power exercised in shelters or governmental institutions {{is not the only}} struggle in which participates a child that decides to stay living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Subsistence is difficult; resources are scare. Children need power to survive, to protect themselves, to stay. Therefore, permanence cannot take place without a minimum amount of power. I find that, when children are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> and are given an option, they establish a balance between <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and previous experiences outside <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> But, not all children have an option or the possibility of exercising that option.
