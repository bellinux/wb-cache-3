5|$|Senator McCain {{became a}} member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee,</b> with which he had {{formerly}} done his Navy liaison work; he also joined the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee. He continued to support the Native American agenda. As first a House member and then a senator– and as a lifelong gambler {{with close ties to}} the gambling industry– McCain {{was one of the main}} authors of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which codified rules regarding Native American gambling enterprises. McCain was also a strong supporter of the Gramm-Rudman legislation that enforced automatic spending cuts in the case of budget deficits.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, a few on Capitol Hill were {{determined}} to overhaul United States Special Operations Forces. They included Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and William Cohen (R-ME), both members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee,</b> and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), {{the chairman of the}} United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem. Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.|$|E

His long-time congressional Chief of Staff, Michael Dayton, was replaced in 2002 by legislative director Robert Uithoven. Uithoven served on Gibbons' staff for many years, including four years as chief of staff. He later served as campaign manager for Gibbons' successful 2006 Gubernatorial campaign. Uithoven was not given a gubernatorial position. His predecessor, Michael Dayton, was named as the governor's top aide.|$|E
25|$|By 1985, when Aspin became {{chairman}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee,</b> he {{was recognized}} as a leading defense authority. His chairmanship caused controversy among some House Democrats, particularly because he supported the Reagan administration's policies on the MX missile and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. Although temporarily removed from his committee chair by his Democratic colleagues in January 1987, Aspin weathered the crisis and regained the chairmanship three weeks later. He again broke with many Democrats in January 1991 when he issued a paper supporting the Bush administration's intention {{to use military force}} to drive the Iraqis from Kuwait. The accuracy of his prediction that the United States could win a quick military victory with light casualties added to his reputation as a military expert.|$|E
25|$|Taylor was {{a member}} of the Blue Dog Coalition, and his voting record was one of the most {{conservative}} among Democrats in the House. He has become a leading Democratic Member of the House Armed Services Committee. He led committee and floor fights to improve the medical benefits of military retirees, and to extend TRICARE health insurance to members of the National Guard and Reserves. Taylor also has focused on U.S. policy in Latin America, sponsoring the successful cap on the number of U.S. troops that can be sent to Colombia without explicit Congressional authorization. Taylor also was a leading critic of the Base Realignment and Closure process, accusing the Department of Defense of smuggling in policy changes that were unrelated to excess capacity or facilities. Taylor served as the Ranking Democrat on the Projection Forces Subcommittee in the 109th Congress, and became chairman of the renamed Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces in the 110th Congress. He and the previous subcommittee chairman Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD), who is now the ranking member of the subcommittee, advocate for more nuclear-powered surface ships in order to reduce the Navy's dependence on imported oil. Taylor is also a member of the Readiness subcommittee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>committee</b> in the 110th Congress.|$|E

500|$|On October 30, 2006, {{before a}} crowd of about 100 people on the Naval Base San Diego waterfront, Hunter {{announced}} {{the formation of an}} exploratory committee to begin raising campaign funds and organizing supporters for the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nomination. He reasoned, [...] "his {{is going to be a}} long road, it's a challenging road, there's going to be some rough and tumble, but I think it's the right thing to do for our country." [...] He did not seek advice from party leaders before making the decision. The New York Times described the move as a [...] "surprise." [...] Mesa College Political Science professor Carl Luna speculated that Hunter's run was an attempt to find [...] "something to do" [...] in preparation for his loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee</b> chairmanship with Democrats heavily favored to reclaim the House. Political analysts saw little chance for the campaign's success. Claremont McKenna College government professor Jack Pitney argued that due to low name recognition and [...] "no following within the party", Hunter [...] "faces extremely long odds".|$|E
500|$|The next month, Hunter {{participated in}} the third GOP debate, {{featured}} on CNN. During the forum, he discussed his experience as chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee</b> and voiced {{his support for the}} War in Iraq and the training of Iraqi battalions for security there. Hunter speculated that Iran was helping to arm the insurgency in Iraq. When asked what he would do as president if he discovered Iran was developing a nuclear weapon, Hunter stated that he [...] "would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons [...] if {{there was no other way}} to preempt..." [...] After discussing foreign policy, Hunter turned his attention to the issue of immigration. He again mentioned the importance of a border wall and evoked the audience's memory about the fence he helped build in his congressional district, joking [...] "if they (illegal immigrants) get across my fence , we sign them up for the Olympics immediately." [...] At the end of the debate, Hunter took the opportunity to criticize the three frontrunners: John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, and Mitt Romney. He complained that Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts exerted too much influence on the three men, describing them as the [...] "Kennedy Wing of the Republican Party." ...|$|E
500|$|As the 114th United States Congress {{assembled}} in January 2015 with Republicans {{in control of}} the Senate, McCain became chair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee,</b> a longtime goal of his. [...] In this position, he led the writing of proposed Senate legislation that sought to modify parts of the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 in order to return responsibility for major weapons systems acquisition back to the individual armed services and their secretaries and away from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. [...] As chair, McCain has tried to maintain a bipartisan approach and has forged a good relationship with ranking member Jack Reed. [...] In April 2015, McCain announced that he would run for a sixth term in Arizona's 2016 Senate election. [...] While there was still conservative and Tea Party anger at him, it was unclear if they would mount an effective primary challenge against him. During 2015, McCain strongly opposed the proposed comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear program, saying that Secretary of State Kerry was [...] "delusional" [...] and [...] "giv away the store" [...] in negotiations with Iran. McCain supported the Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, saying: “I’m sure civilians die in war. Not nearly as many as the Houthis have executed." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 1, 2017, Sessions {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} after reports surfaced {{that he had}} contact with Russian government officials during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, even though during his confirmation hearings he denied he had any discussions {{with representatives of the}} Russian government. News reports revealed that Sessions had spoken twice with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. The first communication took place after a Heritage Foundation event at the 2016 Republican National Convention attended by several ambassadors, including the Russian Ambassador Kislyak who spoke with Senator Sessions. The second interaction took place on September 8, 2016, when they met in Sessions's office; Sessions said they discussed Ukraine and terrorism. Sessions released a statement that day, saying [...] "I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false." [...] U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said: [...] "There was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer. He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign – not about meetings he took as a senator and a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee</b> ...

U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker planned a 2017 investigation. Senator Lindsey Graham indicated he would conduct an investigation during the 115th Congress. On December 11, 2016, top-ranking bipartisan members of the U.S. Senate issued a joint statement responding to the intelligence assessments about Russia's influence on the election.

2500|$|Several {{amendments}} were proposed before final {{passage of}} the bill by the Senate; all were defeated. [...] Among them were an amendment by Robert Byrd which would have added a sunset provision after five years, an amendment by Ted Kennedy directing the Secretary of State to notify other countries that the U.S. considered waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques to be grave breaches of the Geneva Convention (SA.5088), and an amendment by Arlen Specter (R–PA) and Patrick Leahy (D–VT) preserving habeas corpus. The Kennedy amendment was defeated on separation of powers grounds although the Republican manager of the bill and chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee,</b> Senator Warner (R-VA), noted that he agreed with Sen.

2500|$|Public {{as well as}} {{political}} impatience with the war began to emerge in the spring of 1966. At the time, when Johnson's approval ratings were reaching new lows of 41 percent, Sen. Richard Russell, Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Committee,</b> reflected the national mood in June 1966, when he declared it was time to [...] "get it over or get out". Johnson responded by saying to the press, [...] "we are trying to provide the maximum deterrence that we can to communist aggression with a minimum of cost." [...] In response to the intensified criticism of the war effort, Johnson employed the suspicion of communist subversion in the country, and press relations became strained. Johnson's primary war policy opponent in Congress included among others the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, James William Fulbright. The persistent Johnson began to seriously consider a more focused bombing campaign against petroleum, oil and lubrication facilities in North Vietnam in hopes of accelerating victory. Humphrey, Rusk and McNamara all agreed; the bombing began the end of June. In July polling results indicated that Americans favored the bombing campaign by a 5 to 1 margin; however, in August a Defense Department study indicated that the bombing campaign had little impact on North Vietnam.|$|E
