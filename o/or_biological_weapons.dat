25|$|In {{his first}} term in the Senate, Hagel {{voted in favor of}} the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act, {{establishing}} criminal penalties for possession of Chemical <b>or</b> <b>Biological</b> <b>weapons,</b> and he cosponsored the American Missile Protection Act, deploying an effective National Missile Defense system capable of defending the U.S. against limited ballistic missile attacks. Hagel voted to establish the United States Department of Homeland Security, and supported increasing Defense Department spending, voting in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act every year he served in the Senate. Hagel voted for spending increases in preventing HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria funding, and voting against caps on the U.S.'s Foreign aid budget.|$|E
25|$|Intelligence {{indicated}} that {{chemical and biological}} weapons stocks may have been located at a complex known as al Qadisiyah Research Centre along the shore of the al Qadisiyah reservoir among government and residential buildings, on the evening of 26 March, a DEVGRU assault element supported by B Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment assaulted the complex (codenamed Objective Beaver). Whilst the first of four MH-60Ks inserted the Rangers into their blocking positions, it was engaged by small arms fire from a nearby building, an AH-6M spotted the muzzle flashes and fired a 2.75inch rocket into the location silencing the small arms fire, the second MH-60K was also struck by small arms fire but its door gunner suppressed it. A-10As engaged nearby electricity transformers successfully blacking out the area, but it resulted in a series of explosions and a resulting fire at the stations that dramatically lit the sky – pinpointing the orbiting helicopters for enemy gunmen. Small arms fire increased as the final two MH-60Ks inserted their blocking teams, one Ranger was wounded, the two pairs of AH-6Ms and MH-60L DAPs supporting the mission continued to suppress targets as the four MH-47Es carrying the DEVGRU main assault force inserted under heavy enemy small arms fire whilst DEVGRU sniper teams aboard a pair of MH-6Ms engaged numerous gunmen and vehicles, one Nightstalker crew was wounded as the MH-47Es lifted off. The SEALs conducted a hasty SSE while the Ranger blocking positions received and returned fire, the AH-6Ms and the aerial snipers continued to engage enemy gunmen whilst the DAPs pushed further out to ensure no reinforcements approached - engaging and destroying numerous Fedayeen armed technicals. The SSE took longer than expected owing to the size and maze-like structure of the building, the mission completed after 45 minutes, later tests of the material recovered by DEVGRU showed no evidence of chemical <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> at the Objective Beaver.|$|E

500|$|In April 2010, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates {{claimed that}} the Hezbollah has far more {{missiles}} and rockets than the majority of countries, and said that Syria and Iran are providing weapons to the organization. Israel also claims that Syria is providing the organization with these weapons. Syria has denied supplying these weapons and views these claims as an Israeli excuse for an attack. Leaked cables from American diplomats suggest that the United States has been trying unsuccessfully to prevent Syria from [...] "supplying arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon", and that Hezbollah has [...] "amassed a huge stockpile (of arms) since its 2006 war with Israel"; the arms were described as [...] "increasingly sophisticated." [...] Gates added that Hezbollah is possibly armed with chemical <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons,</b> as well as [...] anti-ship missiles that could threaten U.S. ships.|$|E

2500|$|The {{other major}} {{omission}} from Nixon's statement were toxins. His statement did not specifically address toxins, such as ricin, {{which tend to}} blur the line between chemical and biological weapons. As debate within the Army raged over whether toxins were considered chemical <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> concerning the president's order, work on them continued at Fort Detrick, the [...] "hub" [...] of U.S. biological weapons programs. For several months following the November order, the Army continued working on staphylococcus enterotoxin type B (SEB). On February 20, 1970 Nixon added toxins, regardless of their means of production - be it chemical or biological, to the U.S. ban on biological weapons.|$|E
5000|$|Chemical, {{biological}} (CB) — {{and sometimes}} radiological — warfare agents were assigned what is termed a military symbol by the U.S. military until the American chemical and <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> programs were terminated (in 1990 and 1969, respectively). Military symbols {{applied to the}} CB agent fill, {{and not to the}} entire <b>weapon.</b> A chemical <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapon</b> designation would be, for example, [...] "Aero-14/B", which could be filled with GB, VX, TGB, <b>or</b> with a <b>biological</b> modification kit - OU, NU, UL, etc. A CB weapon is an integrated device of (1) agent, (2) dissemination means, and (3) delivery system.|$|R
40|$|The Chemical and <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> (CBW) regime, {{through the}} 1972 <b>Biological</b> and Toxin <b>Weapons</b> Convention and the and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, {{appears to have}} {{established}} sound definitions for what constitutes a <b>biological</b> and chemical <b>weapon</b> which clearly delineate permitted from prohibited forms of violence. Moreover, for the {{large part of the}} history of these Conventions such definitions have served the international community well. However, at the peripheries of these agreements, qualitative and quantitative ambiguities over what constitute chemical and <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> remain. This paper looks at how such ambiguities could, over time, unravel shared understandings of what constitutes a chemical <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapon</b> and, therefore, potentially begin to fray the CBW regime at the seam...|$|R

2500|$|During {{all parts}} of the war, use of {{chemical}} and biological weapons were extremely limited, by both sides, [...] Italy used mustard gas and phosgene during the short Second Italo-Abyssinian War, Germany employed chemical agents such as Zyklon B against Jews, political prisoners and other victims in extermination camps during the Holocaust, and Japan employed chemical and biological weapons in China. In 1943 a U.S. ship carrying [...] a secret Chemical Warfare Service cargo of mustard gas as a precationary retaliatory measure was sunk in an air raid in Italy, causing 83 deaths and about 600 hospitalized military victims plus a larger number of civilian casualties. Generally speaking, World War II was conducted (1939–1945) without use of chemical <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> on the conventional battlefield, and certainly not on the scale of the use of poison gas during World War I.|$|E
2500|$|In foreign policy, {{following}} the September 11, 2001 {{attacks in the}} United States, Blair greatly supported U.S. President George W. Bush's new War on Terror which began with the forced withdrawal of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Blair's case for the subsequent war in Iraq was based on their alleged possession {{of weapons of mass}} destruction and consequent violation of UN resolutions. He was wary of making direct appeals for regime change, since international law does not recognise this as a ground for war. A memorandum from a July 2002 meeting that was leaked in April 2005 showed that Blair believed that the British public would support regime change in the right political context; the document, however, stated that legal grounds for such action were weak. On 24 September 2002 the Government published a dossier based on the intelligence agencies' assessments of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Among the items in the dossier was a recently received intelligence report that [...] "the Iraqi military are able to deploy chemical <b>or</b> <b>biological</b> <b>weapons</b> within 45 minutes of an order to do so". A further briefing paper on Iraq's alleged WMDs was issued to journalists in February 2003. This document was discovered to have taken a large part of its text without attribution from a PhD thesis available on the internet. Where the thesis hypothesised about possible WMDs, the Downing Street version presented the ideas as fact. The document subsequently became known as the [...] "Dodgy Dossier".|$|E
