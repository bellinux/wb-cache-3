Upon Marcy's recommendation, Peggy and Al go to the Hop-On-Inn and discover a videotape waiting for them in their room. After watching some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> the Bundys realize that the couple having sex on the video is Steve and Marcy.

5|$|The Mellotron is an electro-mechanical, {{polyphonic}} tape replay keyboard {{originally developed}} and built in Birmingham, England, in 1963. It {{evolved from a}} similar instrument, the Chamberlin, but could be mass-produced more effectively. The instrument works by pulling a section of magnetic tape across a head. Different portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> can be played to access different sounds.|$|E

40|$|YBaCuO-coated {{conductors}} offer {{great potential}} {{in terms of}} performance and cost-saving for superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL). A resistive SFCL based on coated conductors {{can be made from}} several tapes connected in parallel or in series. Ideally, the current and voltage are shared uniformly by <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> when quench occurs. However, due to <b>the</b> non-uniformity <b>of</b> property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> and <b>the</b> relative positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes,</b> <b>the</b> currents and <b>the</b> voltages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> are different. In this paper, a numerical model is developed to investigate the current and voltage sharing problem for the resistive SFCL. This model is able to simulate <b>the</b> dynamic response <b>of</b> YBCO tapes in normal and quench conditions. Firstly, four tapes with different Jc 's and n values in E-J power law are connected in parallel to carry the fault current. The model demonstrates how the currents are distributed among <b>the</b> four <b>tapes.</b> These four tapes are then connected in series to withstand the line voltage. In this case, the model investigates the voltage sharing between <b>the</b> <b>tapes.</b> Several factors that would affect <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> quenches are discussed including <b>the</b> field dependency <b>of</b> Jc, <b>the</b> magnetic coupling between <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> and <b>the</b> relative positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{tape loops}} were played on BTR3 tape {{machines}} located in various studios of the Abbey Road building {{and controlled by}} EMI technicians in Studio Two at Abbey Road on 7 April. Each machine was monitored by one technician, who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension. The four Beatles controlled the faders of the mixing console while Martin varied the stereo panning and Emerick watched the meters. Eight of the tapes were used at one time, changed halfway through the song. The tapes were made (like {{most of the other}} loops) by superimposition and acceleration. According to Martin, the finished mix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> loops could not be repeated because of the complex and random way in which they were laid over the music.|$|E

Brady was further charged with the murder of John Kilbride, and Hindley with the murder of Edward Evans, on 2 December. At the committal hearing on 6 December, Brady was charged with the murders of Edward Evans, John Kilbride, and Lesley Ann Downey, and Hindley with the murders of Edward Evans and Lesley Ann Downey, as well as with harbouring Brady in the knowledge that he had killed John Kilbride. The prosecution's opening statement was held in camera, and the defence asked for a similar stipulation, but was refused.

5|$|When the {{trapdoor}} to {{the cellar}} mysteriously flies open during dinner, Ash and Scotty {{go down to}} investigate and find the Naturom Demonto, a Sumerian version of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, along with a tape recorder belonging to the archaeologist who owned it. When Scotty plays it, the archaeologist's voice recites a series of incantations, resurrecting a mysterious, demonic entity. Cheryl becomes increasingly hysterical and locks herself in her room. Later, she hears strange voices and goes outside to investigate. Meanwhile, Ash gives Linda a silver necklace, which she absolutely loves. Cheryl is then attacked and raped by demonically possessed trees, but manages to escape. Unable to convince the others of what happened, she asks Ash to take her into town for the night. However, Ash soon discovers that the bridge has been destroyed. Back at the cabin, Ash listens to more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape,</b> learning {{that the only way}} to kill the entity is to dismember it when it possesses a host.

5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind a line. In {{the case of}} horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E
