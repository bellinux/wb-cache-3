40|$|Pequi is an <b>oleaginous</b> <b>fruit</b> whose {{edible oil}} is {{composed}} mainly by saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. The biological and nutritional properties of pequi oil {{are dependent on}} its composition, which can change according to the oil source (pulp or kernel). There is little data in the scientific literature concerning {{the differences between the}} compositions of pequi kernel and pulp oils. Therefore, in this study, different pequi genotypes were evaluated to determine the fatty acid composition of pulp and kernel oils. PCA and PLS-DA were applied to develop a model to distinguish these oils. For all evaluated genotypes, the major fatty acids of both pulp and kernel oils were oleic and palmitic acids. Despite the apparent similarity between the analyzed samples, it was possible to discriminate pulp and kernel oils by means of their fatty acid composition using chemometrics, as well as the unique pequi genotype without endocarp spines (CPAC-PQ-SE- 06). </p...|$|E
40|$|O pequi (Caryocar brasiliense Camb.) tem se destacado por ser um fruto oleaginoso e rico em carotenoides. A secagem é um processo utilizado na extração do óleo por hexano, mas a degradação dos carotenoides e óleo podem ocorrer. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a influência de diferentes métodos de secagem (ao sol, estufa ventilada a 40 e a 60 °C) e do tempo (4 horas e até peso constante) no rendimento e na qualidade do óleo extraído por hexano no extrator Soxhlet. Quando a polpa de pequi foi seca, 3 % ou conteúdo menor de umidade e maior rendimento do óleo foi obtido (52 a 59 %, base seca). Carotenoides totais foram maiores e índice de peróxido menores para a polpa desidratada a 40 °C em estufa ventilada, quando comparada com a secagem da polpa em estufa a 60 °C e ao sol. Estes resultados indicaram que a secagem em estufa a 40 °C por 19 horas resultou num maior rendimento do óleo e menor degradação térmica. Pequi (Caryocar brasiliense Camb) {{has stood}} out {{for being an}} <b>oleaginous</b> <b>fruit</b> rich in carotenoids. Drying is widely used {{technique}} in the oil extraction process using hexane, but the degradation of oil and carotenoids may occur. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of different drying methods (sun, air-circulated drier at 40 and 60 °C) and time (4 hours and up to constant weight) on the yield and quality of the oil extracted using hexane using a soxhlet apparatus. When the pequi pulp was dried up to 3 % or even lower, more oil yield was obtained (52 - 59 %, dry basis). The total carotenoids contents obtained were higher and the peroxide index was lower for the pulp dried at 40 °C in an air-circulated drier when compared to drying at 60 °C in an air-ventilated drier and to sun drying technique. These results indicate that drying in an air-circulated drier at 40 °C for 19 hours resulted in higher oil yields with less heat degradation...|$|E

40|$|Yogurt is {{considered}} a healthy food and by incorporating fruits the flavor and its nutritional value are improved. The objective of this study consists in obtaining and characterization of functional dairy products with added fruits, of yogurt type. The raw material used for obtaining the acid dairy products is cow milk, in which there were incorporated fruits: cherry, bananas and <b>oleaginous</b> <b>fruits</b> (nuts). The evolution in time of the acidity during fermentation {{is influenced by the}} addition of fruits, the highest acidity being reported in the cherry yogurt case. The ascorbic acid content of the fruity yogurts almost doubled compared to simple yogurt, the highest content of vitamin C was found in the yogurt with bananas. The amount of fat was higher in the yogurt containing nuts, because of the <b>oleaginous</b> <b>fruits</b> contribution, fact observed also due to a lower amount of whey released, followed by the yogurt with banana and the cherry yogurt, which released more whey.

40|$|Abstract The vast Amazon {{region has}} {{considerable}} territorial peculiarities and plant species diversity, sometimes {{from the same}} botanical family, which can exhibit significant differences in physicochemical properties. From this diversity, two species stand out – Amazonas tucumã (Astrocaryum aculeatum Meyer) and Pará tucumã (Astrocaryum vulgare Mart.). The research focus is to analyze, comparatively, these <b>oleaginous</b> <b>fruits,</b> their similarities, particularities and potentials regarding the oil quality extracted from two tucumã varieties from the states of Amazonas and Pará, obtained using supercritical carbon dioxide, under different extraction parameters. The results demonstrate the biometric particularities of each species, highlighting the Amazon fruit, which also showed higher oil yield using supercritical CO 2 extraction. The fatty acid quality and profile aspects of the oils show their unsaturated predominance, considering carotenoid content and how the extraction temperature can influence the nutritional quality of the oils. The statistical analyses indicated that the Amazon tucumã oil is superior to the Pará tucumã oil. However, in terms of added value both oils have potential applications in various industrial segments...|$|R
50|$|Bilateral {{trade between}} Australia and Paraguay is small, {{reflecting}} on deals happening at times rather than continuous arrangements of supply. In 2013-14, two-way merchandise trade totaled AUD$3.4 million, of which AUD$1.3 million were Australian exports, made up mainly {{of paper and}} paper products, civil engineering equipment and machine tools for working metal. Australia's major import from Paraguay (2013-14) was oil-seeds and <b>oleaginous</b> <b>fruits.</b> In December 2009, P&O Maritime Services acquired a 70 per cent stake in the Dos Santos Group Bulk Barging business, a river navigation business based in Asunción. P&O's head office is based in Melbourne and the company maintains operations in five Australian ports. There may be some openings for investment in the agribusiness sector and for the export of agriculture related and other products and services from Australia. The mining industry in Paraguay has, to date, been relatively underdeveloped but the recent discovery {{of one of the}} world's three largest deposits of ilmenite (a titanium ore) has the potential to greatly expand mining in the country. Australian companies with existing interests in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay may find that the close commercial ties that these countries have with Paraguay may facilitate entry into the Paraguayan market. In 2011, the Paraguayan-Australian Chamber of Commerce was formed. This organisation works closely with the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires to facilitate and encourage trade and investment between the two countries.|$|R

40|$|Background: Latinos {{experience}} profound {{health disparities}} in diet-related chronic conditions. Emotional eating (EE) has been {{positively associated with}} such conditions, however, {{little is known about}} the relationship between EE and energy-dense food intake that may influence risk for developing these conditions. Objective: To examine associations between EE and energy-dense food intake in Latino men and women. Methods: Latino individuals were recruited from a community health center in Lawrence, MA. Participants completed standardized assessments. EE was measured with the Three Factor Eating Behavior Questionnaire R 18 -V 2. Dietary intake was measured with a culturally tailored Food Frequency Questionnaire. Energy-dense food groups defined as food groups exceeding 225 calories per 100 grams were identified. Covariates considered in this analysis included: age, sex, education, employment status and BMI. Statistical analysis consisted of multivariable logistic regression. Results: A total of 201 participants were included in this analysis (53. 7 % female, 68. 1 % Dominicans). After adjusting for covariates, EE was significantly associated with high intake of sweet and/or fatty foods, namely dairy desserts (i. e., ice-cream, sherbet and frozen yogurt) (OR= 1. 55; 95 %CI= 1. 08, 2. 21; p= 0. 017), <b>oleaginous</b> <b>fruits</b> (i. e., nuts and seeds) (OR= 1. 44; 95 %CI= 1. 01, 2. 05; p= 0. 046) and baked goods (i. e., cakes, cookies, pies, doughnuts and muffins) (OR= 1. 54; 95 %CI= 1. 07, 2. 20; p= 0. 020). Conclusion: EE was positively associated with consumption of energy-dense foods in this Latino sample. Future studies should examine longitudinal associations between EE, intake of energy-dense foods and risk of chronic health conditions. Understanding these associations can unveil potential intervention targets for Latinos at high risk of diet-related chronic health conditions...|$|R
40|$|Principal {{component}} analysis {{is used to}} determine dietary behaviors of a population whereas reduced rank regression is used to construct disease-related dietary patterns. This study aimed to compare both types of DP and theirs associations with cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF). Data were derived from the cross sectional NESCAV (Nutrition, Environment and Cardiovascular Health) study, aiming to describe the cardiovascular health of the Greater region's population (Grand duchy of Luxembourg, Wallonia (Belgium), Lorraine (France)). 2298 individuals were included for this study and dietary intake was assessed using a 134 -item food frequency questionnaire. We found that CVRF-related patterns also reflect eating behaviours of the population.
