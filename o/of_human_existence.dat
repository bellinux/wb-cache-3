Poisons {{have been used for}} many purposes across the span <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>existence,</b> most commonly as weapons, anti-venoms, and medicines.

5|$|Philosopher Dewi Zephaniah Phillips {{published}} The Problem of Evil and the Problem of God in 2004, {{presenting a}} challenge to the Irenaean theodicy. Phillips maintained throughout his work that humans are incapable of fully understanding God, and presented an understanding of the moral diversity <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>existence.</b> With reference to the suffering of the Holocaust, he rejected any theodicy which presents suffering as instrumental, arguing that such suffering cannot be justified, regardless of any good that comes of it.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>existence</b> on the moors around Bolton {{since the early}} part of the Bronze Age, including a stone circle on Cheetham Close above Egerton, and Bronze Age burial mounds on Winter Hill. A Bronze Age mound was excavated in Victorian times outside Haulgh Hall. The Romans built roads from Manchester to Ribchester to the east and a road along what is now the A6 to the west. It is claimed that Agricola built a fort at Blackrod by clearing land above the forest. Evidence of a Saxon settlement exists in the form of religious objects found when the Victorian parish church was built.|$|E

40|$|Conceptions <b>of</b> {{a decent}} <b>human</b> <b>existence</b> are an {{important}} social ideal and mental reference point of modernity. Since {{the era of the}} New Times one can see the desire of the West to monopolize the idea <b>of</b> a decent <b>human</b> <b>existence</b> and associate it primarily with its own cultural and legal tradition. The paper notes that the Russian historical and philosophical thought has developed its own concept <b>of</b> decent <b>human</b> <b>existence</b> which could make the original concept {{of the rule of law}} in Russia...|$|R
40|$|Disease {{and health}} are {{conceptual}} cornerstones of {{the framework of}} all medicine. In different times these concepts have had different contents, but in all times their role has also been to express some status <b>of</b> personal <b>human</b> <b>existence</b> and shape its general and particular forms of individual and collective forms through different wanted or avoided scenarios <b>of</b> <b>human</b> behavior. A long term solo of biological reductionism has strengthened the concept of disease {{as a tool to}} differentiate normal and abnormal structure and behavior <b>of</b> <b>human</b> beings. Current symbiosis of biological reductionism with the trend of stronger social regulation can rewrite the content of the concept of disease in direction to increase of external determinism <b>of</b> personal <b>human</b> <b>existence.</b> Philosophical analysis <b>of</b> the concept of disease can support coherence in the heterogeneous ideological framework of medicine and help to bind technical side of medicine with appropriate values...|$|R
5|$|Koṇḍañña {{thereafter}} {{vowed that}} he would follow when Siddhartha became an ascetic {{to learn from the}} future Buddha's findings. In the meantime, Suddhodana attempted to foil Koṇḍañña's prediction because he wanted his son to succeed him in ruling and expanding the kingdom. Suddhodana made intricate arrangements to shield Siddhartha from all worldly suffering in order to steer his mind away from spiritual matters, pampering him with all the material luxury and sense pleasures that he could find. However, Siddhartha finally persuaded his father to allow him out of the palace to meet his subjects. Suddhodana agreed, but attempted to present a sanitised image <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>existence</b> by ordering beggars, old people and sick people to be kept from the streets. Despite this, Siddhartha saw the four sights which prompted him to reevaluate his view of the world.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{investigate}} the metaphysics of the Buddhist conception of Reality {{to see how}} this can contribute to an ecological understanding <b>of</b> the <b>human</b> <b>existence.</b> Through this investigation I reveal that life from a Buddhist point of view is considered non-divided, alive and holy, and that man has the potential to realize and live according to this non-dual nature. This non-dual metaphysics also express itself through the <b>human</b> <b>existence</b> that according to Buddhism includes three different views of Reality, these are: the ordinary person, the bodhisattva, and the buddha, respectively. These three views are differentiated between according to different epistemic perceptions of Reality that generate three spontaneous different modes of relating to nature, one that is need based and one that is natural and based on compassion. Hence man has the potential to act naturally and spontaneously out of love through the realization <b>of</b> unity. The <b>human</b> <b>existence</b> therefore contains a potential that dramatically can alter man's relationship to nature. Hence a Buddhist perspective ecology argues {{that it is important to}} incorporate a broader understanding <b>of</b> the <b>human</b> <b>existence</b> in the environmental discourse. Through this humans can come to know his potential and understand that there is a different ways for him to relate to all of nature's forms...|$|R

25|$|The generic motif Buber employs to {{describe}} the dual modes of being is one of dialogue (Ich-Du) and monologue (Ich-Es).

40|$|The paper {{defends the}} thesis that Proclus Diadochus' ideas are still {{relevant}} in modern culture. It appears that the ideas of Neoplatonism {{as a whole and}} these of Proclus' in particular matter at least in some aspects of modern culture (or ‘sets of ideals and norms’), such as the foundations of politics, the basic characteristics of philosophy and the fundamental aspects of understanding <b>of</b> the <b>human</b> <b>existence.</b> In the sphere of politics, one can note the ideas useful for creating of the non-totalitarian forms of ideology. In contemporary philosophy (esp. the phenomenological line of investigations) the Neoplatonic studies can be interpreted as one of the bases (or ‘sources’) of understanding of rational knowledge. The ideals of material harmony (true beauty) are essential for understanding <b>of</b> the <b>human</b> <b>existence...</b>|$|R
25|$|Neel {{proposed}} that a genetic predisposition to develop diabetes was adaptive to the feast and famine cycles <b>of</b> paleolithic <b>human</b> <b>existence,</b> allowing <b>humans</b> to fatten rapidly and profoundly {{during times of}} feast in order that they might better survive during times of famine. This would have been advantageous then {{but not in the}} current environment.|$|R
50|$|In Ring's art {{the road}} and the path are {{recurring}} themes, and other lines such as creeks, rivers and estuaries, the open sea and modern elements e.g. bridges, railway tracks and telephone cables are used as main motifs.

25|$|The {{humanistic}} {{approach has}} its roots in phenomenological and existentialist thought (see Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and Sartre).

25|$|Most {{editions of}} Marx’s works were heavily {{influenced}} by the dominant interpretations of correct Marxist–Leninist ideology in the Soviet Union, East Germany and China - which recast Marx's and Engels's thought as a complete, systematic, and fully consistent philosophical categorization <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>existence</b> as a whole, added to by Lenin, Stalin and Mao tse Tung.|$|E

It presents this intimate relationship with God as the highest goal <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>existence.</b>|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a part of}} the interview process that is never usually reported. Listening to what people say is the key to increasing our knowledge <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>existences.</b> Procuring knowledge about human experience is much more challenging. Although good sources on how to prepare and conduct an interview exist, the process of the interviewer&#x 0027;s perception of the interviewee&#x 0027;s message and meaning is less examined. Beyond the role of eliciting the data, the researcher endeavours to reproduce the interviewee&#x 0027;s narration and not the voice of the researcher. By illustrating the process during the interview, further transparency and thereby validity may be achieved. To exemplify this, the perception of the interviewer is explored, and here Heidegger&#x 0027;s work on self-transposition has proved to be helpful...|$|R

25|$|Engineering {{has been}} an aspect of life since the {{beginnings}} <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>existence.</b> The earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 BC in ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization, and Mesopotamia (ancient Iraq) when humans started to abandon a nomadic existence, creating a need {{for the construction of}} shelter.
