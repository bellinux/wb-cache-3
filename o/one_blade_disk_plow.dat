40|$|Scrupulous {{measurements}} and detailed data {{analysis of the}} torque in a swirling turbulent flow driven by counter-rotating <b>bladed</b> <b>disks</b> reveals an apparent breaking {{of the law of}} similarity. Potentially, such breakdown could arise from several possible factors, including dependence on dimensionless numbers other that $Re$ or velocity coupling to other fields such as temperature. However, careful redesign and calibration of the experiment showed that this unexpected result was due to background errorscaused by minute misalignments which lead to a noisy and irreproducible torque signal at low rotation speeds and prevented correct background subtraction normally ascribed to frictional losses. An important lesson to be learnt is that multiple minute misalignments can nonlinearly couple to the torque signal and provide a dc offset that cannot be removed by averaging. That offset can cause the observed divergence of the friction coefficient C_f from its constant value observed in the turbulent regime. To minimize the friction and misalignments, we significantly modified the experimental setup and carried out the experiment with <b>one</b> <b>bladed</b> <b>disk</b> where the disk, torque meter and motor shaft axes can be aligned with significantly smaller error, close to the torque meter resolution. As a result we made precise measurements with high resolution and sensitivity of the small torques produced for low rotation speeds for several water-glycerin solutions of different viscosities and confirmed the similarity law {{in a wide range of}} Re in particular in low viscosity fluids.

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{method is}} {{proposed for the}} early assessment of <b>bladed</b> <b>disk</b> designs with respect to blade mis-tuning effects. Structural and material differences among blades, known as blade mistuning, often cause sig-nificant increases in blade forced vibration amplitudes relative to ideal (tuned) <b>bladed</b> <b>disks,</b> and such effects are most pronounced when the <b>blades</b> and the <b>disk</b> share vibration energy actively. In this paper, it is shown that the flow of vibration energy between the <b>blades</b> and the <b>disk</b> of tuned <b>bladed</b> <b>disks</b> {{can be used to}} char-acterize disk-blade dynamic interaction, and consequently it is proposed as a means to assess blade mistuning effects. Power flow is first calculated for a simple lumped-parameter model, and it is shown to provide a phys-ical explanation for the sharp increases in blade forced response amplitudes that take place when disk-blade dynamic interactions are strong. The power flow analysis is then extended to parametric design studies of finite element models for industrial <b>bladed</b> <b>disks.</b> The calculation of coupling power flow between the <b>blade</b> and the <b>disk</b> segment for a nominal <b>bladed</b> <b>disk</b> sector is shown to enable the rapid, albeit approximate, assessment of mistuning effects on blade vibration response for the nominal <b>bladed</b> <b>disk</b> design as well as for a variety of alternate designs obtained by varying disk structural parameters.

This paper investigates mistuning using a transfer function approach where the frequency response functions (FRFs) are described by natural frequencies and antiresonant frequencies. Using this approach, antiresonant frequencies are {{shown to be a}} critical factor in determining the maximum blade response. Two insights are gained by formulating antiresonant frequencies as the eigenvalues of reduced system matrices: 1) Mistuning a particular blade has no effect on that blade's antiresonant frequencies. 2) Engine orders N and N/ 2, where N is the number of <b>blades</b> on the <b>disk,</b> tend to produce the highest maximum local response. Numerical examples are given using a spring-mass-oscillator model of a <b>bladed</b> <b>disk.</b> Pole-zero loci of mistuned <b>bladed</b> <b>disks</b> show that increased maximum blade response is often due to the damping of antiresonant frequencies.

40|$|In turbomachinery, blade crack {{detection}} methods are beneficial for condition-based maintenance and {{for reducing the}} risk of catastrophic failures due to high cycle fatigue of <b>bladed</b> <b>disks.</b> A crack can be more easily detected in a perfectly tuned <b>bladed</b> <b>disk</b> (i. e., with identical blades and sectors). That is because the crack causes mode distortion and possibly response localization. Unfortunately, perfectly tuned <b>bladed</b> <b>disks</b> are an idealization since small blade mistuning is unavoidable and it can also cause mode distortion and response localization in <b>bladed</b> <b>disks.</b> A detection method has been recently developed to detect the presence of a crack in a mistuned <b>bladed</b> <b>disk</b> and to identify which blade is cracked.

This paper introduces a method which uses a similar physical basis for detection, but requires fewer measurements, namely one measurement location per blade (e. g., obtained using tip-timing methods).

The proposed method is a revision of the already existing well known Two-Parameter Plot (2 PP) method which requires a minimum of two probes. Improvements to the existing 2 PP method are here suggested mainly in the part of engine order identification. The proposed method is then applied to the BTT measured signals coming from a rotating <b>bladed</b> <b>disk</b> excited at different engine orders. At the same time on the disk the vibration of <b>one</b> <b>blade</b> was detected by strain gauges. The strain gauges were calibrated and they provide the reference values of the vibration parameters. The vibration parameters derived by the proposed method are in agreement with those obtained by the strain gages methodolog...|$|R
30|$|The {{underlying}} {{assumption of}} the uncracked <b>bladed</b> <b>disk</b> is that each blade is perfectly tuned, both numerically and physically. This is done by ensuring that each blade has the same number and type of finite elements and subject to identical boundary conditions. For the <b>bladed</b> <b>disks</b> with a single cracked blade, cracks at three different distances from {{the leading edge of}} the blade are used.|$|R
40|$|Probabilistic failure {{assessments}} for integrally <b>bladed</b> <b>disks</b> are {{system reliability}} problems where a failure {{in at least}} <b>one</b> <b>blade</b> constitutes a rotor system failure. Turbine engine fan and compressor blade life is dominated by High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) initiated either by pure HCF or Foreign Object Damage (FOD). To date performing an HCF life assessment for the entire rotor system has been too costly in analysis time to be practical. Although the substantial run-time has previously precluded a full-rotor probabilistic analysis, reduced order models make this process tractable as demonstrated in this work. The system model includes frequency prediction, modal stress variation, mistuning amplification, FOD effect, and random material capability. The model has many random variables which are most easily handled through simple random sampling...|$|R
