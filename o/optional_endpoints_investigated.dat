40|$|Note: Whereas {{geometric}} concentration series (as {{opposed to}} arithmetic concentration series) {{are regarded as}} a requirement in for any cytotoxicity assay {{that is based on}} concentration response analysis, the decimal geometric concentration series described below is just a recommendation. In general dose-response relationships of many pharmacological or toxicological <b>endpoints</b> <b>investigated</b> have a nonlinear, often sigmoidal shape, which can be linearized to some extent by logarithmic transformation of the x-axis. This usually has to be done when IC 50 values are calculated either by regression analysis or by graphical estimation for the current NRU assay. If the concentration series is done with arithmetic progression steps, transformation of the x-axis will result in an unequal distribution of measurements. Therefore, the use of a geometric concentration series (= constant dilution / progression factor) is recommended. The simplest geometric series are dual geometric series, e. g., a factor of 2.

40|$|Introduction: Fractures are painful {{debilitating}} phenomenon, {{which can}} take {{a considerable amount of}} time to heal. Normal healing times range from 4 - 20 weeks depending on a persons age, co-morbidities and fracture characteristics. Whilst a fracture heals a person can experience physical, psychological and social consequences. These can be increased if a fracture progresses to delayed union. Any method to reduce this duration would have wide benefits for all concerned. Furthermore, the exponential rise in our octogenarian population who are at a higher risk of developing a fracture due to osteoporosis mean the incidence of fractures as a whole are lightly to increase. This study investigated Platelet Derived Growth Factor BB (PDGF) or Monobutyrin effects on fracture healing in a closed femoral fracture, rodent model. The primary <b>endpoint</b> was to <b>investigate</b> if an improvement in mean peak load occurred in the treatment groups compared to the control groups. Secondary end points included investigating improvements in fracture union through radiological grading, histological analysis, micro computed tomography and immunohistochemistry. A further <b>endpoint</b> was to <b>investigate</b> if fracture healing is affected in osteoporosis using both non-ovariectomized (sham) and ovariectomized rodents. Method: A standard unilateral, closed femoral fracture model was performed in ovariectomized and non-ovariectomized (sham) Sprague Dawley Rodents. Varying concentrations of PDGF, Monobutyrin or carrier alone were injected percutaneously into the fracture site. A further PDGF group had percutaneous injections administered at 0, 3 and 5 days. Endpoints included radiographs, histology, mechanical testing, micro-computed tomography and Dual Emission X-Ray Absorptiometry at one, three and six week time points. Results: Ovariectomized rodent fractures demonstrated a significant delay in fracture healing compared to sham animals. No particular dose of PDGF or Monobutyrin demonstrated an improvement in fracture healing to all endpoint parameters. The 7. 5 &# 956;g Monobutyrin, mid, high and multiple doses of PDGF may have beneficial influences on fracture healing based on some of the <b>endpoints</b> <b>investigated.</b> Discussion: This study demonstrated that osteoporosis does delay fracture healing. Neither Monobutyrin nor PDGF demonstrated an improvement in fracture healing in all parameters.

Among them, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK 9) might have both clinical and pathophysiological relevance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All available serum samples from a cohort of patients with first AIS (n= 72) were tested for PCSK 9 and included in this sub-study analysis. The primary <b>endpoint</b> <b>investigated</b> the predictive value of early PCSK 9 level variations (ΔPCSK 9) from AIS onset to day 7 or from day 1 to day 7, towards a 90 -day outcome by modified Rankin Scale (mRS). The secondary endpoint explored the association between ΔPCSK 9 {{and the risk of}} major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). RESULTS: Decreased serum PCSK 9 levels at days 1 and 7 were associated with poor clinical outcomes at day 90. At the cut-off point identified by ROC curve analysis (- 61. 28 ng/mL), ΔPCSK 9 day 7 -day 1 predicted a poor mRS at day 90 after AIS. ΔPCSK 9 day 7 -day 1 ≤- 61. 28 ng/mL was associated with an increased rate of MACEs. CONCLUSION: a decrease in PCSK 9 levels was a predictor for poor outcome and increased MACEs after AIS.

40|$|International audienceIt has {{sometimes}} been assumed that children are more sensitive than adults {{to the effects of}} radiofrequency (RF) fields associated with cellular wireless telephones. However, relatively few in vitro or animal models have examined this possibility. In vitro studies have used several cell types, from both humans and rodents, including primary cells, embryonic cell lines, undifferentiated cancer cell lines, and stem cells. Overall, the balance of evidence does not suggest that field-related effects occur in any cell type: gene and protein expression were not significantly changed by exposure in nine out of 15 studies; genotoxicity was evaluated in 13 papers and in most, of these studies, no damage to DNA was detected; eight studies failed to demonstrate induction of apoptosis; and three studies reported lack of oxidative stress induction by RF-exposures. Five of eight studies investigating the effects of combined exposures to RF fields and chemical or physical agents reported a lack of field-related effects. In addition, few papers have been published on the effects of low level exposure of immature animals. The available results are very limited, both in terms of signals used and biological <b>endpoints</b> <b>investigated,</b> but the evidence does not indicate that prenatal or early postnatal exposures are associated with acute adverse responses or the development of detrimental changes in the long-term.

40|$|The use {{of human}} {{peripheral}} blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as an in vitro system to predict in vivo toxicity was investigated. For 58 chemicals, {{the effect on}} cytokine secretion (IL- 5, IFNγ and TNFα) by phytohaemagglutinin-activated PBMC was measured, IC 50 values were calculated and correlations of these endpoints with human LC 50 values were determined. The best result was obtained with IFNγ as an endpoint for which the calculated R 2 value was 0. 58 which is comparable with the R 2 values for the classical neutral red uptake (NRU) assays using murine 3 T 3 cells and normal human keratinocytes (R 2 = 0. 56 and 0. 59, respectively). When for each chemical the lowest IC 50 value of the three endpoints was correlated with LC 50 the calculated R 2 increased slightly to 0. 63. A specific strength of our test is that it corrects several outliers (diazepam, digoxin, malathion and verapamil hydrochloride) which do not fit in the linear regression analysis for IC 50 values obtained with the classical 3 T 3 NRU assay. Furthermore, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, cyclosporine A and pentachlorophenol had a 10 times lower IC 50 value than the estimated human LC 50 value and were identified as immunotoxic alerts.

We used data from 19 nanomaterials that were synthesized and characterized extensively in previous studies. Subsets of these materials have been used in other studies (short-term inhalation, protein carbonylation, and intrinsic oxidative potential), resulting in a unique data set for modeling. Out of a large set of 285 possible descriptors, we have demonstrated that only three descriptors (size, specific surface area, and the quantum-mechanical calculated property ‘lowest unoccupied molecular orbital’) need to be used to predict the <b>endpoints</b> <b>investigated.</b> The maximum number of descriptors that were finally selected by the classification trees (CT) was very low– one for intrinsic oxidative potential, two for protein carbonylation, and three for NOAEC.

40|$|Reviews {{and studies}} on {{individual}} compounds were analyzed {{as to the}} suitability of different study designs and endpoints for detecting adverse effects of chemicals on male reproduction in animal species. Of the <b>endpoints</b> <b>investigated,</b> the most sensitive proved to be histopathology of the testes. Using refined histopathology, effects could be detected {{with a high degree}} of sensitivity as early as 4 weeks after treatment. Other sensitive endpoints were the weights of reproductive organs, including accessory glands, i. e., testis, epididymis, prostate, and of the seminal vesicle, as well as sperm parameters such as sperm count, sperm morphology, and sperm motility. Sperm motility was found to be in some cases more sensitive than histopathology. The above parameters showed a higher sensitivity than fertility parameters. In fact, in most cases, not only one but several endpoints were affected. Continuous breeding studies and 90 -day studies with additional measurements of sperm parameters were similarly effective in detecting compounds which affect male fertility. Interspecies extrapolation factors (IEFs) have been derived for the most sensitive endpoints in laboratory animals. If the calculation is based on caloric demand and a sensitive endpoint of reproductive toxicity, many IEFs tend to be about 1, indicating that humans are generally not more susceptible to reproductive toxicants than laboratory animals. With respect to hazard identification, it is possible to detect adverse effects on male reproduction in a standard subacute study with concentrations that produce significant general toxicity.

The <b>endpoint</b> <b>investigated</b> throughout the thesis, SOS genotoxicity, is empirically related to more familiar endpoints such as mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. Analyses of literature data confirmed correlations between SOS genotoxicity and both Ames/Salmonella mutagenicity and animal carcinogenicity. Analyses of industrial and municipal wastewaters revealed that organic and inorganic chemical production facilities, metal refining and founding facilities and petroleum refineries release high potency wastes. Loading values indicate that low potency sources (e. g. municipal wastewater and pulp & paper facilities) often have exceptionally high loadings. A substantial portion (2. 3 - 99. 8 %) of industrial genotoxins are associated with suspended particulates. Sorption partition efficients (K$ sb{ rm d-genotox}$) indicate that municipal wastewater and pulp & paper facilities release particularly soluble genotoxins. Extracts of suspended particulate matter collected near industrial discharges are direct-acting. Bottom sediment extracts are less potent and usually require S 9 metabolic activation. Genotoxicity of both bottom sediment and suspended particulates are empirically related to the genotoxicity of regional industrial emissions. Direct-acting substances in the water column appear to be less stable and may be converted to more stable pro-genotoxic substances present in the bottom sediments.

In the present study, the effect of copper on four behavioural responses and mortality of A. squamata were quantified at four different temperatures including 25, 20, 15 and 10 °C. At 25 °C the four behavioural responses and mortality were relatively sensitive to copper, with 96 h EC 50 values of 25 (confidence interval 18 – 44), 24 (7 – 26), 32 (24 – 41), 29 (9 – 41) μg L− 1 for the measured ability to turn from the oral surface up to oral surface down, curling behaviour, tube foot movement, and tube foot retraction respectively.

The terminal half-life after oral administration was 8. 0 ± 0. 6 h for the PM and 4. 6 ± 2. 6 h for the EM groups, with the corresponding values after the IV route being 5. 6 ± 1. 7 h and 2. 7 ± 0. 9 h (mean ± SD). The main pharmacodynamic parameters (potency, efficacy, and sensitivity) were estimated for four endpoints (body temperature, creeping speed, ground vertical reaction force and clinical lameness score). The plasma concentration corresponding to half the maximum of the indirect effect were 239 μg/L for creeping speed, 284 μg/L for the lameness score, 161 μg/L for the ground reaction vertical force and 193 μg/L for the body temperature.

The <b>endpoints</b> <b>investigated</b> included {{measurement of the}} concentrations of Cu, Zn, metallothionein and glutathione concentrations, as well as SOD and catalase activity, in liver, kidneys and intestine. In a sub-chronic animal model, the hepatic accumulation of Cu was achieved by administration of dietary Cu (1. 8 g/kg solid diet) for 30 days after which oral Zn (6 g/kg solid diet) was given. Cu treatment induced {{an increase in the}} hepatic and intestinal concentration of Cu of 66 and 455 %, respectively, that was not associated with synthesis of metallothionein synthesis, but rather appeared {{to be related to the}} higher activity of SOD. Subsequent administration with Zn after dietary Cu induced an increase in the hepatic and intestinal metallothionein content of more twice and reduced the Cu content to control values. Thus, Zn could act as both a competitor for absorption on the luminal side of the intestinal epithelium inducing the synthesis of metallothionein. In the second animal model, we studied the effects of interaction between Cu and Zn administered by i. p. injection at the dose of 3 and 10 mg/kg, respectively; Zn was administered subsequent to Cu overload. In this case, when Zn was administered, Cu was already deposited in tissues and thus there is no competition between two metals at the level of membrane transport. In this experimental model treatment with Cu alone induced liver metallothionein synthesis, and the subsequent treatment with Zn did not decrease the hepatic content of Cu. One explanation for these observations is that Zn induces the synthesis of metallothionein, which binds Cu for which it has a higher affinity. Moreover, after treatment with Zn, SOD activity in the liver decreases of almost 30 % with respect to treatment with alone Cu, suggesting that Zn has a protective effect.

40|$|From a {{compilation}} of experimental data on the mutagenic effects of heavy ions in bacteria, main conclusions have been drawn as follows: (1) The mutagenic efficacy of heavy ions in bacteria depends on physical and biological variables. Physical variables are the radiation dose, energy and charge of the ion; the biological variables are the bacterial strain, the repair genotype of bacteria, and the <b>endpoint</b> <b>investigated</b> (type of mutation, induction of enzymes related to mutagenesis); (2) The responses on dose or fluence are mainly linear or linear quadratic. The quadratic component, if found for low LET radiation, is gradually reduced with increasing LET; (3) At low values of Z and LET the cross section of mutation induction sigma m (as well as SOS response, sigma sos. and lambda phage induction, sigma lambda versus LET curves can be quite consistently described by a common function which increases up to approximately 100 keV/mu m. For higher LET values, the sigma(m) versus LET curves show the so-called 'hooks' observed also for other endpoints; (4) For light ions (Z is {{less than or equal}} to 4), the cross sections mostly decrease with increasing ion energy, which is probably related to the decrease of the specific energy departed by the ion inside the sensitive volume (cell). For ions in the range of Z = 10, sigma(m) is nearly independent on the ion energy. For heavier ions (Z is greater than or equal to 16), sigma(m) increases with the energy up to a maximum or saturation around 10 MeV/u. The increment becomes steeper with increasing atomic number of the ion. It correlates with the increasing track radius of the heavy ion; (5) The mutagenic efficiency per lethal event changes slightly with ion energy, if Z is small indicating a rough correlation between cellular lethality and mutation induction, only. For ions of higher Z this relation increases with energy, indicating a change in the 'mode' of radiation action from 'killing-prone' to 'mutation-prone'; and (6) Repair genotype substantially influences the radiation induced mutagenesis. Different mechanisms of mutation induction and/or different types of biologically significant lesions in wild type cells compared to repair deficient strains are a likely explanation...|$|R
40|$|The toxic {{effects of}} the dust triple TiO 2 UV TITAN M 262, TiO 2 UV TITAN M 212 and TiO 2 P 25 (coded NM- 103, NM- 104 and NM- 105, respectively, in the JRC repository) were {{compared}} in a 28 -day inhalation test. Differences in crystal structure (rutile vs. anatase) or surface modification (hydrophobic vs. hydrophilic) suggested a different toxic potential after uptake in lungs. Wistar rats were exposed to aerosol concentrations of 3, 12 and 48 mg/m 3 mimicking exposure scenarios at workplaces (6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 28 days). This dosing scheme induced a non-, partial, and complete lung overload, respectively. <b>Endpoints</b> <b>investigated</b> after end of exposure (3 days, 1. 5 and 3 months of recovery) were i.) analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF); ii.) histopathology; iii.) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis; and iv.) chemical analysis of test item retention in lungs, liver, and brain. - PMN in BALF as inflammation indicator resulted in the low dose groups for NM- 105 at control levels, whereas NM- 103 and NM- 104 induced approx. 10 % PMN. After 45 and 94 days of recovery in clean air, NM- 103 -treated animals also returned to normal; in contrary, NM- 104 -treated animals remained in the significant 5 - 8 % range. In the mid and high dose groups, NM- 105 showed a weaker inflammatory effect than NM- 103 and NM- 104. – Test item retention analysis data reflected well the different grades of clearance retardation due to the various lung loads and fitted to the values predicted by the MPPD model. A very low translocation potential of particles from lungs was detected. - Histopathology revealed a similar dosedependent character of changes between NM- 103, NM- 104 and NM- 105. - TEM analysis showed intraalveolar macrophages as the most prominent compartment of particle detection. - Experimental and predicted NOAEL values (according to Pauluhn, 2011) were 3 and 5 mg/m 3, respectively. A preliminary toxicity ranking {{on the basis of}} the induction of PMN influx and other endpoints is: NM- 104 > NM- 103 > NM- 105. However, pronounced differences in toxicity were not observed between the three test items.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} whether airway responses of sensitized rats to trimellitic anhydride (TMA) were concentration dependent and whether these {{were related to}} irritation by TMA. Groups of BN and Wistar rats were sensitized by two dermal applications of TMA (50 % w/v, followed by 25 % w/v in vehicle). Controls received vehicle (acetone-olive oil 4 : 1, v/v). All animals were challenged 3 wk after the first sensitization by inhalation of one {{of a range of}} concentrations of TMA (0. 2 - 61 mg/m 3 for BN rats, 15 - 250 mg/m 3 for Wistar rats). Breathing pattern, breathing frequency, and tidal volume were measured before, during, and after challenge to assess allergic and irritative airway responses. One day after challenge, non-specific airway responsiveness to a range of concentrations of methacholine was measured. At necropsy on the same day, blood was withdrawn for measuring total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and organs were weighed. Larynx, trachea and lungs were examined histopathologically. In BN rats, TMA sensitization elevated total IgE levels; subsequent inhalation challenge with 2 mg/m 3 of TMA and higher caused laryngeal inflammation with squamous epithelial metaplasia, and pulmonary hemorrhages. Concentration-related decreases in breathing frequency and alterations in breathing pattern, which differed from the irritation-induced pattern, were also observed at these levels. Inhalation challenge with TMA concentrations of 12 mg/m 3 and higher increased lung weight. Increased nonspecific airway responsiveness was observed at the 2 next higher tested concentrations of 46 and 61 mg/m 3. In unsensitized BN rats, only laryngeal squamous metaplasia was observed, albeit at higher challenge concentrations of TMA, and decreased breathing frequency, a typical breathing pattern characteristic of irritation. Identically sensitized Wistar rats showed airway inflammation and pulmonary hemorrhages upon challenge with TMA, but no functional changes, even at distinctly irritating concentrations of TMA up to 250 mg/m 3. In conclusion, TMA challenge of sensitized BN rats caused challenge concentration-related allergic airway inflammation, asthmalike changes in breathing pattern, and increased nonspecific airway responsiveness. The lowest no-observed-effect level (NOEL) based on the most sensitive <b>endpoint</b> <b>investigated</b> was 0. 2 mg/m 3, a value that is well below the irritation concentration. The presence of a NOEL in the sensitized BN rat suggests that assessment of safe human exposure levels is feasible...|$|R
40|$|We report {{conductivity}} {{measurements of}} Cr-doped V 2 O 3 using a variable pressure technique. The critical {{behavior of the}} conductivity near the Mott-insulator to metal critical <b>endpoint</b> is <b>investigated</b> in detail {{as a function of}} pressure and temperature. The critical exponents are determined, as well as the scaling function associated with the equation of state. The universal properties of a liquid-gas transition are found. This is potentially a generic description of the Mott critical endpoint in correlated electron materials. Published as: Science vol. 302 p. 89 (October, 3 rd, 2003) 1 Since the early recognition by Mott [1, 2] that electron-electron interactions are responsible for the insulating character of many transition-metal oxides, extensive research over the last decade has demonstrated the key importance of this phenomenon for the physics of strongly correlated electron materials. Outstanding examples [3] are superconducting cuprates, manganites displaying colossal magnetoresistance, or fullerene compounds. There are two routes for achieving a metallic state, starting from a Mott insulating material. The first is to introduce charge carriers by doping. The second, closely connected to Mott’s original ideas, is to reduc...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{fracture}} mechanics concerning contact interaction between elastic infinite plate and elastic compound semi–space is investigated. Plate and semi–space are weakened by finite through cracks, which are perpendicular to surface of heterogeneity {{in the same}} plane. Assuming that structure is deformed in antiplane deformation state it is required to determine the contact stress distribution and fracture stress intensity factors dependence of structure heterogeneity and geometrical parameters. Using the Fourier integral transform the problem is reduced to find the solutions of system of two singular integral equations. System solutions behavior at integration domain <b>endpoints</b> is <b>investigated</b> for all cases. In some special cases of cracks location, equations kernels can also contain fixed singularities. An efficient numerical method to solve such equations is suggested. Numerical calculations are done and results are shown in tables and graphs, which express contact stresses and stress intensity factors dependence on problem parameters and simultaneously reveal dangerous cases of fracture of the structure. In the present paper an antiplane problem about contact interaction between an infinite laye...|$|R
40|$|Summary. In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} and analyze two new cost measures {{related to the}} communication overhead and the space requirements associated with virtualpath layouts in ATM networks, that is the edge congestion and the node congestion.

We first give tight results concerning the time complexity of the construction of such layouts for both the two congestion measures, that is we exactly determine all the tractable and intractable cases. Then, we provide some combinatorialbounds for arbitrary networks, together with optimal layouts for specific topologies such as chains, rings and grids...|$|R
