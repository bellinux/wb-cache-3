25|$|Single-cylinder engines were reintroduced in 1925 as 1926 models. These singles were {{available}} either as flathead engines or as <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> engines until 1930, {{after which they}} were only available as flatheads. The flathead single-cylinder motorcycles were designated Model A for engines with magneto systems only and Model B for engines with battery and coil systems, while <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> versions were designated Model AA and Model BA respectively, and a magneto-only racing version was designated Model S. This line of single-cylinder motorcycles ended production in 1934.|$|E
25|$|In 1902, de Dietrich hired 21-year-old Ettore Bugatti, who {{produced}} prize-winning cars in 1899 and 1901, and he designed an <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> 24hp (18kW) four-cylinder with four-speed transmission {{to replace the}} Vivinus. He also created their 30/35 of 1903, before quitting to join Mathis in 1904.|$|E
25|$|Apart from fifty {{examples}} of the 648, a special racing version of the Sport Scout, the Scout was not continued after World War II. In 1949 an all-new motorcycle, with an <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> straight-twin engine, was called the Scout; it was enlarged and renamed the Warrior in 1950.|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} other Le Rhône series engines, the 9C {{featured}} highly visible telescopic copper induction pipes {{and used a}} single push-pull rod to operate its two <b>overhead</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
25|$|The C11 used a C10 motor {{fitted with}} an <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> {{cylinder}} head. The C11 frame was almost unchanged until 1951 when BSA added plunger rear suspension. Early gearboxes were weak and unreliable. The C11G was available with a three ratio gearbox and rigid frame or a four ratio gearbox and a plunger frame. Both models had better front brakes than earlier models. This model {{was a common}} commuter motorcycle, and many survive today.|$|E
25|$|Rover {{supplied}} 499cc {{single cylinder}} motorcycles to the Russian Army during the First World War. The company {{began to focus}} on car production {{at the end of the}} war, but Rover still produced motorcycles with 248cc and 348cc Rover <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> engines and with JAP engines, including a 676cc V-twin. In 1924 Rover introduced a new lightweight 250cc motorcycle with unit construction of engine and gearbox. This had lights front and rear as well as a new design of internal expanding brakes.|$|E
25|$|At {{the price}} of {{increased}} complication for a high pressure diesel type injection system, fuel consumption in the same range as small pre-chamber automotive and industrial diesels has been demonstrated with Curtiss-Wright's stratified charge multi-fuel engines, while preserving Wankel rotary advantages Unlike a piston and <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> engine, there are no valves which can float at higher rpm causing loss of performance. The Wankel is a more effective design at high revolutions with no reciprocating parts, far fewer moving parts and no cylinder head.|$|E
50|$|Crossflow heads use <b>overhead</b> <b>valves,</b> {{but these}} can be {{actuated}} by camshafts that are either in the cylinder block, with actuation by push rods and rockers, or {{by one or more}} overhead camshafts.|$|R

5000|$|The 170 {{engine was}} {{upgraded}} to <b>overhead</b> <b>valves</b> (OHV) for 1961, gaining [...] {{in the process}} (up to [...] ), enough of an improvement that Studebaker saw fit to finally discontinue the Big Six.|$|R
25|$|Until the mid-1940s, the {{traditional}} horizontal four-stroke single-cylinder 500cc engines were fitted with one overhead and one side valve but {{contrary to the}} usual practice of having inlet over exhaust (IOE), this employed the side valve for induction and the <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> for exhaust. Also unusual was the adoption of only one hairspring (type of valve spring) to close the exhaust valve. These were the highest performance engines Moto Guzzi sold to the general public. By contrast, the company supplied the official racing team and private racers with higher performance racing machines with varying overhead cam, multi-valve configurations and cylinder designs.|$|E
25|$|De Freville's first engine {{design was}} a four-cylinder engine with {{aluminium}} pistons and pressure lubrication, which was unusual for that time. The first car model using de Freville's engine was the Alvis 10/30. It {{was an instant}} success and established the reputation for quality workmanship and superior performance for which the company was to become famous. The original 10/30 side-valve engine was improved, becoming by 1923 the <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> Alvis 12/50, a highly successful sports car that was produced until 1932. Around 700 of the 12/50 models and 120 of the later Alvis 12/60 models survive today.|$|E
25|$|Power {{comes from}} <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> (two per cylinder), pushrod, {{naturally}} aspirated, carbureted 358 cubic inch (5.86 L) V8 engines, producing anywhere from 850 to 875 horsepower. The minimum base weight (including driver and driver gear) for all cars is 2,780 pounds. Fuel cell capacity is 33 U.S. gallons. Current rules {{allow for the}} use of leaded gasoline, whereas all other classes must use unleaded gas. The use of Nitrous Oxide (or other similar compounds or systems), fuel additives, and/or fuel cooling, as well as supercharging or turbocharging is strictly prohibited in all classes. Automatic transmissions are prohibited, and manual transmissions must have no more than 5 forward speeds, and a functional reverse speed.|$|E
50|$|Designed by Edgar Franks in 1933, {{the first}} run was almost {{identical}} to the Norton Model 18 except for the bore and stroke. The single-cylinder engine was 348 cc with pushrod operated <b>overhead</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The four {{cylinder}} 2323cc engine {{placed the}} car in the 13CV car tax band. Fed via <b>overhead</b> <b>valves</b> by a single Stromberg 22 carburetor, it produced a claimed maximum output of [...] at 4,000 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{was offered}} {{with a choice}} of 4-cylinder engines, {{including}} a side-valve [...] of 1172 cc made by S.C.A.P., a 1476 cc overhead-valve by S.C.A.P., and a 1994 cc Altos with either side or <b>overhead</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
25|$|The first {{internal}} combustion piston engine design to be widely used for powering aircraft was the Antoinette water-cooled V8 engine, {{believed to be}} the very first V-form eight-cylinder {{internal combustion}} engine ever placed in production, designed by the Frenchman Léon Levavasseur. The Antoinette 8V incorporated direct fuel injection, evaporative water cooling and other advanced features, weighed 95kg (209lb) and produced 37kW (50hp). Introduced in 1906, these engines were used by, among others, Santos Dumont, the early Voisin aircraft and Samuel Cody. American aviation engine designers quickly picked up on the V-8 engine concept from 1906 onwards as the era progressed, with both Glenn Curtiss' firm designing a series of liquid-cooled V-8 aviation engines culminating in the Curtiss OX-5 by the early years of World War I — another major American engine manufacturer, Hall-Scott, had their A-2 and A-3 <b>overhead</b> <b>valve,</b> liquid-cooled V-8s in production as early as 1908.|$|E

50|$|The FC (101) was {{the last}} Victor to have an engine with push rods and rockers {{operating}} the <b>overhead</b> <b>valves.</b> Victor FC models had racked up 238,000 sales by late 1967 when the 'Coke bottle'-shaped FD replaced it.|$|R
50|$|The new Corvette LT1 engine, {{the first}} of the Gen 5 family of Small Block engines, retains the push-rods acting on <b>overhead</b> <b>valves</b> design. It {{implements}} direct fuel injection, Active Fuel Management (cylinder deactivation), and continuously variable valve timing.|$|R
5000|$|The T11's {{engine was}} an {{air-cooled}} horizontally opposed twin cylinder engine with <b>overhead</b> <b>valves.</b> It had {{a capacity of}} [...] and was located above the front beam axle which was attached to it by a transverse elliptical leaf spring.|$|R
500|$|Studebaker {{had enjoyed}} earlier success {{and was the}} first {{independent}} automaker to produce an <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> V8 engine, a 232.6 cubic inch, 120hp unit, the first low-priced V8. [...] The company's peak year was 1950, when it produced and sold 329,884 units. Studebaker struggled {{during the first half of}} the decade. [...] The cars had styling ahead of their time but were overpriced when compared to the offerings of the Big Three. Low sales and financial difficulties led to a merger with Packard in 1954, itself in financial trouble. [...] The new company, Studebaker-Packard Corporation, retired the Packard name in July 1958, but continued marketing automobiles under the Studebaker name until 1966.|$|E

The low compression ratio meant the engine could consume inexpensive and commonly available low octane fuel, as well as minimizing the effort to kick start the engine, making the extra weight and expense of an electric starter an unnecessary creature comfort. Though {{some of the many}} Super Cub variations came with both kick and electric start, the majority sold well without it. Even the latest 2011 model year Japanese domestic market (JDM) Super Cub 50 and Super Cub 110 versions, with modern technology and conveniences like fuel injection and a fuel gauge, were not offered with an electric start option.|$|E
