40|$|Purpose: By {{studying}} {{the case of}} a Changsha engineering machinery manufacturing firm, this paper aims to find out the optimization tactics to reduce enterprise’s <b>logistics</b> <b>operational</b> cost. Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds the structure model of manufacturing enterprise’s <b>logistics</b> <b>operational</b> costs from the perspective of inter-firm network and simulates the model based on system dynamics. Findings: It concludes that applying system dynamics in the research of manufacturing enterprise’s logistics cost control can better reflect the relationship of factors in the system. And the case firm can optimize the logistics costs by implement joint distribution. Research limitations/implications: This study still lacks comprehensive consideration about the variables quantities and quantitative of the control factors. In the future, we should strengthen the collection of data and information about the engineering manufacturing firms and improve the <b>logistics</b> <b>operational</b> cost model. Practical implications: This study puts forward some optimization tactics to reduce enterprise’s <b>logistics</b> <b>operational</b> cost. And it is of great significance for enterprise’s supply chain management optimization and logistics cost control. Originality/value: Differing from the existing literatures, this paper builds the structure model of manufacturing enterprise’s <b>logistics</b> <b>operational</b> costs from the perspective of inter-firm network and simulates the model based on system dynamics. </p...|$|R

The pattern was demonstrated by the watermelon <b>logistics</b> <b>operational</b> pattern based on information share. The result showed that the pattern was effective and practicable. Agricultural products logistics is the entity flow process of agricultural products from producing areas to consumption areas. It {{is characterized by the}} large quantity, more varieties, wide distribution and great demand universality. Agricultural products are animal and plant life products, and the logistics process can not be polluted and deteriorated, so the greening of production is specially required [1]. For the lower prices and larger volume of agricultural products, process distribution is necessary to achieve low-cost operation and increase the services value in the logistics process. Agricultural products logistics faces great difficulties such as packaging, transportation, warehousing for its characteristics and lower price[2]. At present, Due to agricultural products own characteristics, logistics technology, management mechanism and other affects, th...|$|R

40|$|It {{is now a}} norm in the {{convenience}} store supply chain that a logistics company (or companies) provides logistics services to both chain stores and their suppliers. The coverage rate of stores has become the major factor for winning in the marketplace of chain store businesses. Logistics companies need to establish a logistics center for each market area to provide quick response to the stores in that specific service area. The planning of supply chain <b>logistics</b> <b>operational</b> mechanism has became the critical success factor for the reduction of total supply chain operational costs. This mechanism can also reduce the complexity and cycle time of supply chain operational processes, such as the supply chain management of logistics center, integrated payment process among stores, logistics companies, and product suppliers.
