5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boxes,</b> but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E

When her room was searched later, campus police {{discovered}} {{most of her}} belongings packed in boxes and the art removed from the walls. It's not clear whether Murray packed them that day, but police at the time asserted she'd packed between Sunday night and Monday morning. On top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> was a printed email to Murray's boyfriend indicating trouble in their relationship. Around 3:30 pm, she drove off the campus in her black 1996 Saturn sedan; classes at the university had been canceled that day due to a snowstorm.|$|E
5|$|The only area {{in which}} Keela and Eddie gave alerts was {{apartment}} 5A. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in the living room, and on and under the veranda in the bedroom Madeleine's parents had used. The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, {{about the death of}} a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> of clothes.|$|E

25|$|A dowser {{claimed that}} he could detect water, even in a bottle inside a sealed {{cardboard}} box. He was shown twenty boxes and {{he was asked to}} indicate which boxes contained a water bottle. He selected eight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> which he said contained water. Actually, only five of the twenty contained water. Of the eight selected boxes, only one was revealed to contain water and one contained sand. It was not revealed whether any of the remaining six boxes contained water.|$|E
25|$|In another, single-stimulus rehabilitatory approach, {{the patient}} is shown a {{computer}} screen with a box in each corner and a fixation cross at the center. When a stimulus appears in any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boxes,</b> {{the patient is}} instructed to indicate seeing it as quickly as possible. This task is eased somewhat by an indicating icon before the stimulus – either an arrow that points to the box the stimulus is most likely (but not guaranteed) to be in, or a cross {{to indicate that the}} stimulus could appear in any box. Following thirty hour-long sessions, patients demonstrated a significant decrease in both extinction and hemispatial neglect.|$|E
25|$|On {{the advice}} of {{acoustics}} firm, Kirkegaard Associates, the lack of reverberation and the difficult performance conditions for musicians were corrected by changes {{in the fabric of}} the auditorium. Surfaces that had previously absorbed sound were transformed to support and sustain that sound. The tapestries on the back walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> were gathered up to increase reverberation, but can be redeployed, together with additional absorbent blinds above the stage and around the Hall whenever needed. The wooden wall panels of the Hall were relined to change their acoustic qualities and the undulating plaster ceiling panels were completely reconstructed using more robust materials to provide greater warmth of sound and support for bass frequencies.|$|E

25|$|Within a few hours, the IFE and {{the polling}} station {{officials}} explained that between 8 and 10 ballots {{for the election}} to the Lower House had been incorrectly placed in the presidential ballot box (this could be seen because the ballots for the presidential, senatorial, and lower house elections were printed on different colored paper, to match the colors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boxes).</b> Article 231 of the COFIPE states that ballots placed in the incorrect box should be moved to the correct box. The president of the polling station ordered the ballots moved to the correct box, and all representatives present agreed to this.

On July 11, both the president of the polling place and the observer representing López Obrador's Coalition confirmed that this was indeed what had occurred.|$|E
25|$|Gein {{admitted}} to stealing from nine graves and led investigators to their locations. Because authorities were uncertain {{as to whether}} the slight Gein was capable of single-handedly digging up a grave during a single evening, they exhumed two of the graves and found them empty (one had a crowbar in place of the body), thus apparently corroborating Gein's confession. Allan Wilimovsky of the state crime laboratory participated in opening three test graves identified by Gein. The caskets were inside wooden boxes; the top boards ran crossways (not lengthwise). The tops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> were about two feet (60 cm) below the surface in sandy soil. Gein had robbed the graves soon after the funerals while the graves were not completed. They were found as Gein described: One casket was empty, one Gein had failed to open when he lost his pry bar, and most of the body was gone from the third, but Gein had returned rings and some body parts.|$|E
25|$|Police boxes {{continued}} {{to play an important}} role in police work until the late 1960s to early 1970s, when they were phased out following the introduction of personal radios. As the main functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> were superseded by the rise of portable telecommunications devices like the walkie-talkie and the near universal access by the public to telephones and the 999 emergency number, very few police boxes remain in Britain today. Some have been converted into High Street coffee bars. These are common in Edinburgh, though the city also has dozens that remain untouched — most in various states of disrepair. Edinburgh's boxes are relatively large, and are of a rectangular plan, with a design by Ebenezer James MacRae, who was inspired by the city's abundance of neoclassical architecture. At their peak there were 86 scattered around the city. In 2012, Lothian and Borders Police sold a further 22, leaving them owning 20.|$|E

25|$|In the Listening exam of 2007, {{there was}} a part asking {{students}} to determine whether marked sentences were correct or not, based on the whole recording. There were 10 questions, carrying 2 marks each. In that part, if a candidate answered a question correctly, 2 marks were awarded but if the question was answered, 2 marks were deducted. No marks were given or deducted for blank answers. A candidate who answered all the questions, {{with no more than}} 5 being correct, would end up having no marks for that section, but if 5 were correct, 10 marks were given. That stirred up controversy among candidates, who claimed that the marking scheme was not fair. They said that all questions were compulsory so there should not be any advantage to those who left some of the blanks empty by deducting marks for wrong answers. The HKEAA said that it had been in practice for years to prevent students guessing answers, but in fact, this type of marking had appeared only in table-type questions in which candidates were required to tick some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> in the table but not in questions in which all blanks were to be filled.|$|E
25|$|The Metropolitan Police (Met) {{introduced}} police boxes throughout London between 1928 and 1937, and {{the design}} that later became the most well-known {{was created by the}} Met's own surveyor and architect, Gilbert MacKenzie Trench, in 1929. Initially, two competing prototype designs were installed on the newly built Becontree Estate in December 1928, with the winning builder being contracted to erect 43 boxes made of wood with concrete roofs in the final Trench pattern as part of experimental installations in the Richmond and Wood Green sub-divisions, which were completed in December 1929 and January 1930 respectively. Their success resulted in the widespread adoption of the system throughout Greater London over the next eight years using newer models of the Mackenzie Trench design now made completely of concrete for increased durability, save the doors, which were still made of teak. Constables complained that the concrete boxes were extremely cold and damp compared to their wooden predecessors, so provisions were made for more powerful heaters. For use by officers, the interiors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> normally contained a stool, a table with drawer, a brush and duster, a fire extinguisher, a first aid kit, and a small electric heater. Like the 19th and early 20th century Glaswegian boxes, the London police boxes had a light at the top of each box, which would flash as a signal to police officers indicating that they should contact the station.|$|E

The player, as an unnamed character, explores an island with numerous structures and natural formations. The island is roughly divided into eleven sections, arranged around a mountain that represents the ultimate goal for the player. Within each section is a gold box that must be reached to activate it, requiring the player to complete a sequence of puzzles within that section to reach it. Once activated, a turret emerges from the box and shines a light towards {{the top of the}} mountain, indicating that section is complete. The player needs to activate some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> in the game to be able to access the inside of the mountain and ultimately reach the game's final goal, though additional puzzles can be discovered if all eleven turrets are activated. There are additional optional puzzles scattered around the island. One optional set of puzzles, accessible after entering the mountain and colloquially referred to as [...] "The Challenge", is a time-based test to complete about a dozen algorithmically-generated mazes within seven minutes, set to music from Edvard Grieg's [...] "Anitra's Dance" [...] and [...] "In the Hall of the Mountain King".
