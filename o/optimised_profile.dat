An inverted penalty index based on a number of key performance parameters was generated as a fitness function and vehicle dynamics simulations were carried out with the multibody simulation package Gensys. The effectiveness of each profile produced by the genetic algorithm was assessed using the roulette wheel method. The method has been applied to the rail profile on the Stockholm underground, where problems with rolling contact fatigue on wheels and rails are currently managed by grinding. From a starting point of the original BV 50 and the UIC 60 rail profiles, an optimised rail profile with some shoulder relief has been produced. The <b>optimised</b> <b>profile</b> seems similar to measured rail profiles on the Stockholm underground network and although initial grinding is required, maintenance of the profile will probably not require further grinding...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{photovoltaic}} industry, {{screen printing}} accounts for {{majority of the}} metallisation processes for silicon wafer solar cells. Contact formation by co-firing of front and rear screen printed metal pastes for mainstream p-type standard solar cells is a well-established process. It is of utmost importance to use front and rear metallisation pastes that are co-firing compatible. In this paper, we describe a methodology for front and rear paste selection and process optimisation. We explore the usage of HF dip (20 seconds) on finished cells to differentiate between over-fired and under-fired contacts. Two commercially available front Ag pastes (paste „A‟ & paste „B‟) with fine line printing capability were tested along with two commercially available rear Al pastes (paste „C‟ & paste „D‟). Firing optimisation was conducted to achieve a one-Sun fill factor of 80. 7 % and a series resistance at maximum power point (MPP) of 0. 4 Ωcm 2 at the optimised firing profile. The Al paste „C‟, {{which resulted in a}} better and more uniform back surface field at the <b>optimised</b> <b>profile,</b> was selected to study the effect of post -metallisation HF etching. By choosing the correct combination of metal pastes, at the optimised firing profile, efficiencies of 18. 5 % were realised for standard screen-printed 156 mm x 156 mm p-type pseudo-square monocrystalline solar cells...|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper was conducted as part of the CLEAN-FLIGHT project which is financed by the Malta Council for Science and Technology through the National Research and Innovation Programme 2011 (Grant Agreement R&I- 2011 - 021). Traditionally, aircraft descend from cruise level towards the aerodrome in a stepped manner as directed by Air Traffic Control to ensure safe separation between aircraft, particularly in the terminal area. A descent methodology that is now being preferred is that of <b>optimised</b> <b>profile</b> descents (OPD). In OPDs, the aircraft descends from the top-of-descent (TOD) point towards the aerodrome following a smooth, continuous descent profile that is optimal from an operational perspective of choice, until it intersects the final approach glide path such as that of the Instrument Landing System (ILS). OPDs are advantageous because they consume less fuel and generate fewer emissions than their stepped counterparts. This paper presents a proposal of new approach procedures for use in the approaches to Malta International Airport (MIA) that will facilitate the introduction of OPDs. With around 28, 000 aircraft movements per annum at MIA, this can be achieved by giving Air Traffic Control Officers (ATCOs) a selection of approach procedures on which to direct in-trail inbound and outbound aircraft without imposing altitude constraints. The discussion includes a study of current procedures, a statistical analysis of historical radar plots, the presentation of the proposed approaches, and a forecast of the potential gains in terms of fuel burn and emissions expected through fast-time simulation. peer-reviewe...|$|E

Aims of the present work were: i) the acquisition of field load spectra on instrumented skirolls; ii) the fatigue life prediction of modern skirolls after constant amplitude fatigue testing; iii) the structural optimisation of the skirolls and the redesign for a target mission. Two pairs of traditional aluminium skirolls were strain gauged {{in order to measure}} the bending actions in the vertical and horizontal planes: two full bridge measured the vertical plane bending at two different locations, whereas two half bridges applied at the two wheel supports measured the lateral loads. A rugged data acquisition system was used to record several sessions of classical and skating technique on four elite and amateur athletes. The system allowed to measure the instantaneous load values and positions during the push phases: typical load patterns were obtained and peak values were normalised to the testers body weight giving 125 % B. W. in the classical technique and 137 % B. W. in the skating technique. Field load spectra were collected during typical ski sessions and compared with fatigue test data from a fatigue test bench at DolomitiCert laboratory. The knowledge of in field load spectra and the skiroll fatigue curves allowed to perform the fatigue life prediction of the existing skirolls and to compare it with a target mission. A solid model of each skiroll was reconstructed with ProE® and FEM analysed with Ansys®. The finite elements model was validated comparing the results of the simulation with the laboratory tests.

40|$|Ever {{increasing}} air traffic, {{rising costs}} and tighter environmental targets create a pressure for efficient airport ground movement. Ground movement links other airport operations such as departure sequencing, arrival sequencing and gate/stand allocation and its operation can affect each of these. Previously, reducing taxi time {{was considered the}} main objective of the ground movement problem. However, this may conflict with efforts of airlines to minimise their fuel consumption as shorter taxi time may require higher speed and acceleration during taxiing. Therefore, in this paper a multi-objective multicomponent optimisation problem is formulated which combines two components: scheduling and routing of aircraft and speed profile optimisation. To solve this problem an integrated solution method is adopted to more accurately investigate the trade-off between the total taxi time and fuel consumption.

40|$|Abstract. High {{strength}} aluminium {{wrought alloys}} {{as well as}} powder metallurgical aluminium alloys are limited regarding massive formability. The formability at room temperature can be significantly affected by superimposing hydrostatic pressure. Depending on the process control, cold forming enables locally induced strain hardening effects, whereby increased hardness or hardness gradients can be regulated. Simultaneously, the necessity of mechanical post processing is reduced by a metal forming fabrication of joint and connection elements at room temperature. By splitting the component in strengthened and not strengthened regions, specially adapted property profiles can be adjusted to the application. Thus, specially load adapted components with locally <b>optimised</b> property <b>profiles</b> e. g. ductile or high strength, brittle areas can be manufactured.

The economical potential of the emitter epitaxy is confirmed by cost calculations on system level and shows that using thin-film solar cells with epitaxial emitter could be up to 5 % cheaper per watt peak than using corresponding cells with POCl 3 diffusion. Simulation results based on experimental doping profiles with a moderate bulk and a higher surface doping level show that efficiencies up to 15. 3 % are possible with a 20 µm thick base. An optimum emitter thickness between 1 and 2 µm is found for an emitter doping level of 5 x 1018 cm- 3. The experimental results tally nicely with the simulated values. To increase the current, a front texture is combined with the epitaxial emitter. For thin-films a texture is usually made by Plasma etching, which, however, induces shunts in our epitaxial emitter. Therefore, a subsequent short Phosphorus diffusion seems necessary to prevent these shunts. Solar cell results of thin-films on highly-doped Cz substrates reach efficiencies up to 15. 2 %...|$|R

40|$|Membrane {{reactors}} {{belong to}} the most innovative concepts in chemical reaction engineering capable to intensify a multitude of processes and to improve selectivities and yields with respect to valuable intermediate products. Typical examples where the latter aspect is of importance are partial oxidations or hydrogenations. Profound knowledge exists about the modelling of conventional tubular catalytic fixed-bed reactors where the reactants are fed together at the reactor inlet. The application of simplified 1 D isothermal models is state of the art, e. g. [1]. Less studies were oriented on a more detailed mathematical modelling (2 D, non-isothermal). Main difficulties usually arise in particular for low aspect ratios. Then radial distributions of porosities, flow rates and transport coefficients {{have to be taken}} into account [2]. The situation is even more complex if reactants are also dosed along the reactor axis. Purpose of this contribution is the formulation, solution and application of a non-isothermal 2 D membrane reactor model (steady state, pseudohomogeneous). The radial and axial velocity field is quantified by a modified Navier Stokes equation (containing a side friction term). A critical and novel issue is the proper formulation of boundary conditions at the reactor wall in the mass and energy balances considering mass transfer through the wall. For validation of the 2 D model a parallel experimental study of the highly exothermic oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene applying a VO x /γ-Al 2 O 3 -catalyst was performed a) in a one stage, b) in a cascade of three membrane reactors and c) in the established conventional fixed bed reactor [3, 4]. Main focus of the parametric study presented is the estimation of the internal temperature profile, the internal molar fraction profiles for reactions and the mathematical description of the different velocity fields in fixed bed and membrane reactors. The performance of 1 D and 2 D membrane reactor models will be compared. In a second part the potential of various types of stage-wise temperature profiles in combination with corresponding <b>optimised</b> dosing <b>profiles</b> is presented. The concept allows to improve significantly the selectivity and yield of an intermediate product in parallel-series reactions. The concrete results depends on the ratios of the rates of desired and undesired reactions. Thus, the temperature impact is determined by the specific activation energies of all reactions. Results for three conceivable constellations are presented (activation energy of the desired reaction can be the largest, smallest or equal to the activation energy of the undesired reactions). An <b>optimised</b> stage-wise temperature <b>profile</b> is proven to be a powerful way to improve performance parameters (e. g. conversion). Hot spots and runaways can be effectively suppressed by an adjusted cooling and/or heating. Further, improved performance can be achieved by combining the <b>optimised</b> stage-wise temperature <b>profile</b> with a stage-wise dosing of one or several of the reactants [5], respectively.

40|$|Abstract Optimisation of {{a railway}} vehicle–track {{system is a}} complex process. The paper {{presents}} a procedure for optimal design of a wheel profile based on geometrical wheel/rail con-tact characteristics such as the rolling radii difference (RRD).

The shape of the wheel profile approximated by a piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial is varied during the optimisation process to satisfy the optimality crite-ria. A numerical technique called multipoint approximations based on response surface fitting (MARS) has been chosen as an optimisation method. The proposed optimum design pro-cedure {{has been applied to}} improve the performance of metro trains in Rotterdam (RET), The Netherlands. The trains were suffering from severe wheel tread wear {{and as a result of}} that from lateral vibrations (hunting). Using the proposed proce-dure, a new wheel profile has been obtained and applied to the RET metro trains. The results of the optimisation have shown that the performance of a railway vehicle can be improved by improving the contact properties of the wheel and rail. After the application of the <b>optimised</b> wheel <b>profile,</b> the instability of the metro trains has been eliminated and the lifetime of the wheels has been increased from 25, 000 to 120, 000 km...|$|R
40|$|For most {{patients}} who require lipid-lowering treatment, statin monotherapy {{is the appropriate}} treatment. However, in those patients where statin monotherapy does not produce optimal lipid levels, {{the combination of a}} statin with niacin, a bile acid sequestrant, a fibric acid derivative, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor or a fish oil preparation may provide improved control. The choice of combination therapy depends upon the patient's lipid profile and tolerability of the medication. Combination of a statin with niacin, a bile acid sequestrant or ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, should be considered for patients with very high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, while combination with either a fibric acid derivative or a fish oil should be considered for patients with high LDL-C and high triglyceride levels. A number of new lipid-lowering agents are currently in development, including cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors, ileal bile acid transport (IBAT) inhibitors, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors and dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha and gamma agonists. Introduction of these novel therapies will provide opportunities for developing different combination strategies that may help to <b>optimise</b> lipid <b>profiles</b> in patients who are currently difficult to treat. The introduction of new combinations will require careful study to ensure that the risks of drug interactions and adverse events are minimise...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the historical {{development of the}} wheel and rail profiles currently used on railway vehicles. It also presents the key damage mechanisms involved in wheel-rail contact and summarises the methods that have recently been developed by railway engineers to predict the level of wheel and rail damage from these mechanisms. Tools for predicting the key damage modes of wear and rolling contact fatigue (RCF) are explained. Methods of optimising the wheel and rail profiles to reduce the overall damage and therefore improve the efficiency of the railway system are discussed and a case study from the UK of an ‘anti-RCF’ wheel profile is presented. Finally a novel method using a genetic algorithm is discussed which uses a penalty index to <b>optimise</b> the wheel <b>profile</b> for good running, low track forces and rail stress, low wear and RCF...|$|R
