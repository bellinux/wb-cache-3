50|$|Landscape of {{urbanization}} - Most of the world's cities are expanding into agricultural land. Landscape planning for urbanization {{is concerned with}} the conservation and development of landscape resources as urbanization takes place. Ian McHarg's approach to this problem was to prepare a series of overlay maps showing the different types of quality in the land around settlements: agricultural value, property value, hydrological value, scenic value, recreational value, ecological value etc. The maps of value were then overlaid to produce a composite map which looked like an X-Ray photograph - with the dark areas having the most value and the white areas the least value. His belief was that the 'white land' should be urbanized in preference to the 'black land'. The <b>overlay</b> <b>mapping</b> system which McHarg proposed is now carried out using a Geographic Information System. Other landscape planners have proposed greenways and green belts as a means of urban growth management.|$|E

We develop an integrative synthesis of different <b>overlay</b> <b>mapping</b> techniques and associated perspectives on technological emergence across the geographical, social, and cognitive spaces. To do so, we longitudinally analyse (with publication and patent data) three case-studies of emerging technologies in the medical domain. These are: RNA interference (RNAi), Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing technologies for cervical cancer, and Thiopurine Methyltransferase (TPMT) genetic testing. Given the flexibility (i. e. adaptability to different sources of data) and granularity (i. e. applicability across multiple levels of data aggregation) of <b>overlay</b> <b>mapping</b> techniques, we argue that these techniques can favour the integration and comparison of results from different contexts and cases, thus potentially functioning as platform for a ’distributed’ strategic intelligence for analysts and decision-makers...|$|E

40|$|How can scientometric mapping {{function}} {{as a tool of}} ’strategic intelligence’ to aid the governance of emerging technologies? The present paper aims to address this question by focusing on a set of recently developed scientometric techniques, namely <b>overlay</b> <b>mapping.</b> We examine the potential these techniques have to inform, in a timely manner, analysts and decision-makers about relevant dynamics of technical emergence. We investigate the capability of <b>overlay</b> <b>mapping</b> in generating informed perspectives about emergence across three spaces: geographical, social, and cognitive. Our analysis relies on three empirical studies of emerging technologies in the biomedical domain: RNA interference (RNAi), Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing technologies for cervical cancer, and Thiopurine Methyltransferase (TPMT) genetic testing. The case-studies are analysed and mapped longitudinally by using publication and patent data. Results show the variety of ’intelligence’ inputs <b>overlay</b> <b>mapping</b> can produce for the governance of emerging technologies. <b>Overlay</b> <b>mapping</b> also confers to the investigation of emergence flexibility and granularity in terms of adaptability to different sources of data and selection of the levels of the analysis, respectively. These features make possible the integration and comparison of results from different contexts and cases, thus providing possibilities for a potentially more ’distributed’ strategic intelligence. The generated perspectives allow triangulation of findings, which is important given the complexity featuring in technical emergence and the limitations {{associated with the use of}} single scientometric approaches...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{modernize}} previous work on science <b>overlay</b> <b>maps</b> by updating the underlying citation matrix, generating new clusters of scientific disciplines, enhancing visualizations, and providing more accessible means for analysts to generate their own maps. Design/methodology/approach: We use the combined set of 2015 Journal Citation Reports for the Science Citation Index (n of journals = 8, 778) and the Social Sciences Citation Index (n = 3, 212) for a total of 11, 365 journals. The set of Web of Science Categories in the Science Citation Index and the Social Sciences Citation Index increased from 224 in 2010 to 227 in 2015. Using dedicated software, a matrix of 227 × 227 cells is generated on the basis of whole-number citation counting. We normalize this matrix using the cosine function. We first develop the citing-side, cosine-normalized map using 2015 data and VOSviewer visualization with default parameter values. A routine for making overlays on the basis of the map (“wc 15. exe”) is available at [URL] Findings: Findings appear in the form of visuals throughout the manuscript. In Figures 1 – 9 we provide basemaps of science and science <b>overlay</b> <b>maps</b> for a number of companies, universities, and technologies. Research limitations: As Web of Science Categories change and/or are updated so is the need to update the routine we provide. Also, to apply the routine we provide users need access to the Web of Science. Practical implications: Visualization of science <b>overlay</b> <b>maps</b> is now more accurate and true to the 2015 Journal Citation Reports than was the case with the previous version of the routine advanced in our paper. Originality/value: The routine we advance allows users to visualize science <b>overlay</b> <b>maps</b> in VOSviewer using data from more recent Journal Citation Reports. ...|$|R
