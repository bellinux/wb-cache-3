5|$|By November 1885, Adler had a {{theatrical}} club of his own, the Princes Street Club, No. 3 Princes Street (now Princelet Street, E1), purpose-built, financed by a butcher named David Smith. It seated 300; playing every night except Friday, he was earning about £3 s.10 a week, {{but with a}} fame well out <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the meagre money. Many {{of the most prominent}} figures in Yiddish theater, including Sigmund Mogulesko, David Kessler, Abba and Clara Shoengold, and Sara Heine (the future Sara Adler), gave guest performances when they passed through London.|$|E
5|$|Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia (also {{known as}} The Triumph of Cleopatra) is based loosely on Plutarch's Life of Antony and Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, {{in which the}} Queen of Egypt travels to Tarsus in Cilicia aboard a grand ship to cement an {{alliance}} with the Roman general Mark Antony. While superficially similar to The Coral Finder, Cleopatra is {{more closely related to}} the style of Regnault, with its intentionally cramped and crowded composition. The individual figures are out <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> each other and the ship, while many figures are tightly positioned within a small section of the painting. As well as from Regnault, the work borrows elements from Titian, Rubens and classical sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Persons with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have no detectable systemic {{symptoms or}} signs (i.e., outside the mouth). Generally, symptoms may include prodromal sensations such as burning, itching, or stinging, which may precede {{the appearance of}} any lesion by some hours; and pain, which is often out <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> {{the extent of the}} ulceration and is worsened by physical contact, especially with certain foods and drinks (e.g., if they are acidic). Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer, and then recedes as healing progresses. If there are lesions on the tongue, speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable, and ulcers on the soft palate, back of the throat, or esophagus can cause painful swallowing. Signs are limited to the lesions themselves.|$|E

25|$|Because of the three-fifths {{compromise}} in the U.S. Constitution, in which slaves {{counted in the}} calculation of how many representatives a state had in Congress (though only three-fifths {{as much as a}} free person), the planter class had long held power in Congress out <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the total number of free people in the US population as a whole.|$|E

The invention of the Tower and Stockade system by which 52 settlements from 1938 to 1947 largely decided the borders of Israel in the UN 29 November 1947 decision, is attributed to kibbutz member Shlomo Gur.|$|E
25|$|Pain is severe, {{frequently}} out <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> physical signs, {{and often}} requires {{the use of}} opiates to reduce it to tolerable levels. Pain should be treated as early as medically possible. Nausea can be severe; it may respond to phenothiazine drugs but is sometimes intractable. Hot baths and showers may lessen nausea temporarily, though caution should be used to avoid burns or falls.|$|E

25|$|Complex {{regional}} pain syndrome (CRPS), {{also known}} as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), is a long term pain syndrome that often worsens with time. It is characterized by severe pain out <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the original injury and is often accompanied by sensitivity, swelling, {{and changes in the}} skin. It may initially affect one limb and then spread throughout the body; 35% of affected people report symptoms throughout their whole body.|$|E

25|$|Geologically {{one of the}} {{youngest}} inhabited territories on Earth, Easter Island, located in the mid-Pacific Ocean, was, for most of its history, one of the most isolated. Its inhabitants, the Rapa Nui, have endured famines, epidemics of disease and cannibalism, civil war, slave raids, various colonial contacts, and have seen their population crash on more than one occasion. The ensuing cultural legacy has brought the island notoriety out <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the number of its inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|The Congress {{was given}} {{authority}} {{to ban the}} international slave trade after 20 years (which it did in 1807). A compromise gave the South Congressional apportionment out <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> its free population by allowing it to include three-fifths {{of the number of}} slaves in each state's total population. This provision increased the political power of southern representatives in Congress, especially as slavery was extended into the Deep South through removal of Native Americans and transportation of slaves by an extensive domestic trade.|$|E

Similarly, in Europe, mobile phone companies overspent on 3G licences, which led them deep into debt and led to the telecoms crash.

25|$|It often {{happened}} {{that the number}} of lay brothers became excessive and out <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the resources of the monasteries, there being sometimes as many as 200, or even 300, in a single abbey.

The squadron moved by the 22d, and on the 23d operations began from the new station. By early October, with the American infantry advancing on all points between the Argonne and the Meuse, German aircraft were concentrating all available resources to stop the Air Service from getting information about its rear areas. Enemy aircraft were constantly attacking squadron aircraft with a far higher intensity than what was experienced earlier, and the 91st brought down a number of enemy planes, far out <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> what might be expected from an observation squadron.|$|E
25|$|The American Federation of Labor (AFL) began {{granting}} charters {{to police}} unions in June 1919 when pressed {{to do so}} by local groups, and in just 5 months had recognized affiliate police unions in 37 cities. The Boston police rank and file went out on strike on September 9, 1919 in order to achieve recognition for their union and improvements in wages and working conditions. Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that police officers had any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the AFL. During the strike, Boston experienced two nights of lawlessness until several thousand members of the State Guard supported by volunteers restored order, though not without causing several deaths. The public, fed by lurid press accounts and hyperbolic political observers, viewed the strike with a degree of alarm out <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> the events, which ultimately produced only about $35,000 of property damage.|$|E
