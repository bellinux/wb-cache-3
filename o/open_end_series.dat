50|$|The {{creative}} process in traditional and digital painting {{is more or}} less the same, but when the digital artist is done, there is nothing to hang on a wall. The painting is on the hard disk of a computer. The usual way to make it presentable and salable is to project it on a traditional carrier, such as paper, canvas or polyester. This is commonly done by a professional printer. For an original painting, the traditional physical carrier substitutes the digital carrier, which is deleted. For a series, the digital carrier is deleted when the prefixed number of copies has been reached. For an <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> <b>series,</b> the digital carrier is retained on the computer.|$|R
50|$|Doe's work {{evolved into}} {{the focus of the}} female body. In an {{interview}} by Pierogi, Don Doe explores his thoughts on the transition into a new set of works; titled Scopophilia. These works depicted men taking photos of women in various poses. “I have another series of a solitary male utilizing a camera possibly as a voyeuristic device preparing to either document his female subject or keep a distance from her, a very <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> <b>series</b> without an outcome, but full of noir. I am working on two other series about pissing in public and another about gun hobbyists in the woods. So I guess the men illustrate a problematizing of the male gaze, and other blurred distinctions between life and the authoritative nudes of the masters, that an eventual instillation will resolve.” The male and female figures play into the viewer's understanding of social reality, as well as the classical masters who also painted nude figures. This is further explored in an interview of a 2003 show that Don Doe partook in. This review in the New York Times by Ken Johnson briefly goes over the way Doe's work interacts with mythology and male desire.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article reports an all-atom {{molecular}} dynamics simulation to study a model pulmonary surfactant film interacting with a carbonaceous nanoparticle. The pulmonary surfactant is modeled as a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine monolayer with a peptide consisting of the first 25 residues from surfactant protein B. The nanoparticle model with a chemical formula C 188 H 53 was generated using a computational code for combustion conditions. The nanoparticle has a carbon cage structure reminiscent of the buckyballs with <b>open</b> <b>ends.</b> A <b>series</b> of molecular-scale structural and dynamical properties of the surfactant film in the absence and presence of nanoparticle are analyzed, including radial distribution functions, mean-square displacements of lipids and nanoparticle, chain tilt angle, and the surfactant protein B peptide helix tilt angle. The {{results show that the}} nanoparticle affects the structure and packing of the lipids and peptide in the film, and it appears that the nanoparticle and peptide repel each other. The ability of the nanoparticle to translocate the surfactant film {{is one of the most}} important predictions of this study. The potential of mean force for dragging the particle through the film provides such information. The reported potential of mean force suggests that the nanoparticle can easily penetrate the monolayer but further translocation to the water phase is energetically prohibitive. The implication is that nanoparticles can interact with the lung surfactant, as supported by recent experimental data by Bakshi et al...|$|R

Purpose - This study examines participant’s response rate on dual style training course evaluation forms. These combine structured and <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> formats. Pencil and paper forms {{have a long history of}} use by trainers in business and commerce and more recently in education. Research methods texts tend to have neglected the issue of response rates with this type of form. Design/methodology/approach - Approximately 2000 course participants attending 28 courses completed evaluation forms. These were designed with a series of structured responses scales followed by a section for <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> comments. Findings – It was found the completion rate for the <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections was low and thus validity was suspect. Various explanations were offered for this. Subsequently when a redesigned evaluation form was administered to a further 1641 course participants it was found response rates increased dramatically when <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections were placed earlier in the questionnaire. Practical implications – Indicates ways in which course evaluation forms can be redesigned to increase response rates for <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections and thus improve the validity of any findings. Originality/value – Provides information about response rates neglected by most methodology texts concerning the design of training evaluation questionnaires which include <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections...|$|R

In the present study, we visualized the shock wave and exhaust flowfields using a shadowgraph optical system and we obtained peak overpressure in the tube axial direction and the continuous shape transformation of shock waves around the tube <b>open</b> <b>end.</b> We also obtained overpressure histories of the shock wave using piezo-pressure transducers within 201 m from the <b>open</b> <b>end</b> of the tube. We normalized and classified these results by four regions using non-dimensional pressure and distance which are independent of variety of mixture and tube diameter. In {{the vicinity of the}} <b>open</b> <b>end</b> of the tube, the shock wave is nearly planar and does not significantly attenuate, and the peak overpressure maintains approximately C–J pressure. Subsequently, the shock wave attenuates rapidly, transforming from quasi-spherical to spherical.
