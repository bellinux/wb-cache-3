5|$|The kvitel {{is either}} {{sent to the}} Rebbe by {{messenger}} <b>or</b> <b>mail,</b> or given personally by the Hasid during his private audience with the Rebbe. The kvitel is usually given together with a sum of money known as a pidyon (redemption), which {{is used by the}} Rebbe for the upkeep of his court or for distribution to charity. Some Rebbes requested from the Hasid a sum of money equal to twice the numerical value of the Hebrew word Chai (life), which equals 18. Others took an amount of money equal to the numerical value of the letters of the Hebrew names of the Hasid or his wife.|$|E
5|$|The 33-seat Saab 340B {{airplane}} {{used for}} Crossair Flight LX498 had been leased to Crossair from Moldavian Airlines since 1 October 1999. The plane {{was scheduled to}} depart from Zurich Airport on Monday, 10 January 2000, at around 6:00p.m. and arrive at Dresden Airport a few hours later. The cold, drizzly weather was normal for the area, there were no indications that anything {{was wrong with the}} aircraft, and, although this particular aircraft had 24,000 flying hours since its November 1990 delivery, this type of airplane had a very good safety record. Captain Pavel Gruzin, 41, had 8,100 hours of flying time, with 1,900 in the Saab 340 type. Co-pilot Rastislav Kolesár, 35, had about 1,800 total hours, with 1,100 hours in the Saab 340 type. The plane was carrying no unusual payload such as freight <b>or</b> <b>mail</b> and the plane was not due for its next regular maintenance check for another 21 days, on 31 January 2000.|$|E
5|$|The English {{enjoyed a}} marked superiority over the Scots in cavalry, {{particularly}} with the resurgence of heavy cavalry with their use of demi-lancers. The feudal heavy cavalry had begun to disappear from Scottish armies after Bannockburn in 1314. It was limited by the shortage of suitable horses. James V imported great horses and mares from Denmark {{in an attempt to}} improve the quality of Scottish breading stock. In the mid-sixteenth century the Scots still lacked sufficient heavy cavalry. In their place they fielded relatively large numbers of light horse, often drawn from the Borders and usually wearing jacks of leather <b>or</b> <b>mail,</b> mounted on small horses and using light lances. As firearms became available they began to field relatively large numbers of mounted arquebusiers.|$|E

25|$|A new major variant, Mi-1M in 1957 {{introduced}} an enlarged cabin {{and the more}} powerful AI-26VF engine, which allowed the accommodation of three passengers on a bench behind the pilot. Cabin height increased from 1.22 to 1.26 m and width from 1.01 to 1.2 m. A noticeable difference was horizontal bottom windows line instead of slanted, with bigger rear side windows, and a less pointed fuselage nose. It could also be fitted with two external side capsules for the injured <b>or</b> <b>mail.</b> There were trials of an armed anti-tank variant Mi-1MU carried in 1961, being the first Soviet attack helicopter, {{but it did not}} enter production due to having a small payload and the cessation of production of the basic variant.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of rural free delivery (RFD) by the Post Office in 1896, and in Canada in 1908, many rural residents had no access to the mail unless they collected it at a post office located many miles from their homes or hired a private express company to deliver it. For this reason, mailboxes did not become popular in rural North America until curbside RFD mail delivery by the Post Office was an established service. Even then, farmers and rural homeowners at first resisted the purchase of dedicated mailboxes, preferring to leave empty bushel baskets, tin boxes, or wooden crates at the roadside for the postman to deposit their mail. Not until 1923 did the Post Office finally mandate that every household install a mailbox <b>or</b> <b>mail</b> slot {{in order to receive}} home delivery of mail.|$|E
25|$|Maritime mail is a {{theme that}} offers {{a wide variety of}} possibilities. Study of a {{particular}} shipping line like, Cunard, P & O, Danube steamers, South American packets or American steamboat mail are a few options as are; Ship Letter marks, mail between a mother country and its colonies <b>or</b> <b>mail</b> between two countries separated by seas or oceans. Many ships applied their own s so collecting examples of all ships of a particular shipping line can be aspired to. Maiden voyages and wreck covers are very desirable. Maritime mail rates changed frequently and occasionally varied for different shipping lines over the same route that could be due to treaty changes or arguments between countries that involved retaliatory rates. Naval mail can also fall in the Military mail category and are also known to apply identifying endorsements or postmarks.|$|E

25|$|In April 1944, Stilwell {{launched}} his final offensive {{to capture the}} Burmese city of Myitkyina. In support of this objective, the Marauders were ordered to undertake a long flanking maneuver towards the town, involving a grueling 65-mile jungle march. Having been deployed since February in combat operations in the jungles of Burma, the Marauders were seriously depleted and suffering from both combat losses and disease, and lost additional men while {{en route to the}} objective. A particularly devastating scourge was a severe outbreak of amoebic dysentery, which erupted shortly after the Marauders linked up with the Chinese Army in India, called X Force. By this time, the men of the Marauders had openly begun to suspect Stilwell's commitment to their welfare, and no effort to hide their displeasure with their hard-driving commander. Despite their sacrifices, Stilwell appeared unconcerned about their losses, and had rejected repeated requests for medals for individual acts of heroism. Initial promises of a rest and rotation were ignored; the Marauders were not even air-dropped replacement uniforms <b>or</b> <b>mail</b> until late April.|$|E
