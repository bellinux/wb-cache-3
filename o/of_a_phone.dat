TouchWave developed a product line called WebSwitch {{that was designed}} to replace traditional private telephone exchange systems in small-to-medium-sized companies. WebSwitch was part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> system that incorporates communication features provided by the Internet. The rapid success of TouchWave was memorialized with awards and an acquisition by Ericsson Communications for $46M two years after TouchWave was founded. Ericsson continued the TouchWave product line under the name WebCom, but its efforts have been viewed as less than successful.|$|E

500|$|At {{roughly the}} same time as Quatermass II was being {{transmitted}} by the BBC, Hammer Film Productions released their film adaptation of the first serial in British cinemas. Directed by Val Guest, it was retitled The Quatermass Xperiment, and starred American actor Brian Donlevy as part of a deal to help the film find US distribution. Kneale, who had little involvement with the film, was unimpressed with this casting. [...] "I may have picked Quatermass's surname out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> book, but his first name was carefully chosen: Bernard, after Bernard Lovell, the creator of Jodrell Bank.

500|$|In 2003, {{the creator}} of the Case Closed series, Gosho Aoyama, had stated he would draw a story arc taking place in London.

During his trip, Aoyama took special note <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> booth near Big Ben and a drain pipe, engraved with the words [...] "Valley of Fear", on the Westminster Bridge; these two aspects were used in the story. While creating the story, Aoyama expressed difficulty incorporating English in the text. He also revealed Minerva Glass, a fictional tennis player in the story, was based on professional tennis player Steffi Graf and the scene where Conan calls out to Minerva during her tennis match was inspired by an event during the 1996 Wimbledon Championships where a fan jokingly shouted his proposal to Graf during her semi-finals match. For Shinichi's confession to Ran, Aoyama created the scene with Sherlock Holmes' poor ability with relationships and the phrase [...] in mind.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{was a fan}} of Bart, and in {{addition}} to doing a guest spot on the show, he wanted to give Bart a number one single. He therefore co-wrote the song [...] "Do the Bartman", which was released as a single around {{the same time that the}} episode was produced. Jackson could not take credit for his work on the song due to contractual reasons. Jackson also wrote the song [...] "Happy Birthday Lisa", which was later included in the album Songs in the Key of Springfield. A version of the song was reportedly scheduled to be included on a bonus disk in the October 2001 special edition of Jackson's 1991 album Dangerous. However, the bonus disk was eventually dropped from the release. Jackson died on June 25, 2009, and the Fox network re-aired the episode on July 5 as a tribute to him. The producers had intended to air the episode on June 28, 2009, three days after Jackson's death, but could not resolve issues with syndication rights in time. The music video for [...] "Do the Bartman" [...] was aired on that date instead. The producers screened the episode first, and the only change made, which was unrelated to Jackson, was the blurring <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> number.|$|E
500|$|Dota 2 {{includes}} a seasonal Elo rating-based matchmaking system, which {{is measured by}} a numerical value known as [...] "matchmaking rating" [...] (MMR) and separated into different tiers. MMR is updated based on if a player's team won or lost, which will then increase or decrease respectively. The game's servers, known as the [...] "Game Coordinator", attempts to balance both teams based on each player's MMR, with each team having roughly a 50% chance to win in any given game. Ranked game modes with a separately tracked MMR are also available, which primarily differ from unranked games by making MMR publicly visible, as well as requiring the registration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> number to their accounts, which help foster a more competitive environment. To ensure that each player's ranking is up to date and accurate, MMR is recalibrated every six months. The highest ranked MMR players are listed by Valve on an online leaderboard, which lists the 200 highest for each region. The game also {{includes a}} report system, which allows players to punish player behavior that intentionally provides a negative experience. Other features include an improved replay system from Defense of the Ancients, in which a completed game can be downloaded in-client and viewed by anyone at a later time, and the [...] "hero builds" [...] feature, which provide integrated guides created by the community that highlight to the player on how to play their hero.|$|E
500|$|While playing junior hockey, Hextall's coaches {{advised him}} that he would not reach the NHL if he {{continued}} to move the puck. Not everyone agreed; NHL goaltender Darren Pang described feeling as if [...] "he had just witnessed Superman flying out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> booth" [...] when he saw Hextall's puckhandling ability in a minor league game. Former NHL goaltender Johnny Bower, when scouting for the Toronto Maple Leafs in Brandon, remarked that Hextall would at times let in soft goals, and doubted if he would reach the NHL; Hextall retained a tendency to let in occasional weak goals throughout his career. Hextall claims his adventurous style stemmed from his youth, when he played on outdoor ice rinks with a skater's stick, rather than the heftier goaltender's stick. Martin Brodeur modelled his own play on that of Hextall, saying [...] "I love {{the fact that he was}} playing the puck. He was one of the first goalies that came out and played the puck. He was a little rough for my liking, but it was entertaining. The playing of the puck was the big thing." [...] Hextall's mobility provided extra passing opportunities for his defencemen: when killing a penalty they would frequently pass the puck back to him, relieving some of the pressure on his team. He is described on the Hockey Hall of Fame's Legends of Hockey website as being [...] "perhaps the game's most mobile goalie of all time." ...|$|E

500|$|Irish-American actor Brian Donlevy {{was brought}} in by Robert L. Lippert to play the title role of Quatermass to provide an {{interest}} for American audiences. Donlevy, in his own words, specialised in [...] "he-men roles – rough, tough and realistic". Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Beau Geste (1939), he was also known for his appearances in The Great McGinty (1940) and The Glass Key (1942). At the time he appeared as Quatermass his career was in decline, however. Donlevy's no-nonsense portrayal of Quatermass {{is very different from}} that of Reginald Tate in the television version and was not to Nigel Kneale's liking, who said, [...] "I may have picked Quatermass's surname out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> book, but his first name was carefully chosen: Bernard, after Bernard Lovell, the creator of Jodrell Bank. Pioneer, ultimate questing man. Donlevy played him as a mechanic, a creature with a completely closed mind”. Responding to Kneale's criticisms, Val Guest said, [...] "Nigel Kneale was expecting to find Quatermass like he was on television, a sensitive British scientist, not some American stomping around, but to me Donlevy gave it absolute reality". By this stage in his career, Donlevy was suffering from alcoholism; it was some weeks into the shoot before Guest became aware that the flask of coffee he always carried on set was laced with brandy. Guest found, however, that [...] "Brian was all right, no problem at all once you kept him sober". He reprised the role of Quatermass in Quatermass 2 (1957) but was replaced by Andrew Keir in the third film, Quatermass and the Pit (1967).|$|E
