This construction is determined by a a faithful unitary representation of P_ 0 (canonical representation) whose images under {{the action of the}} group of automorphisms tend to the identity representation as r→ 0. We apply this construction to the groups <b>of</b> <b>currents</b> <b>of</b> the maximal parabolic subgroups of the groups of motions of the n-dimensional real and complex Lobachevsky spaces. The obtained representations of the groups <b>of</b> parabolic <b>currents</b> can be uniquely extended to the groups <b>of</b> <b>currents</b> with values in the semisimple groups O(n, 1) and U(n, 1).
