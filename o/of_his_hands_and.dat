5|$|After {{returning}} to Birmingham, Doyle soon linked up with Championship club Nottingham Forest on a short-term loan deal in December 2004. The loan was then extended {{to keep him}} at the City Ground {{for the rest of}} the season. Doyle made his first-team debut for Forest in a fifth-round FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur on 20 February 2005. As the match approached half-time, Doyle gifted Tottenham the lead as a Jermain Defoe free kick bounced out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> into the net, but Forest were able to equalise in the second half to take the tie to a replay. Even though Doyle only played in a further three league matches for Forest, he said he was glad to be able to play regular reserve-team football and the loan spell had exceeded his expectations. He was rumoured to be {{returning to}} Forest on loan for the following season, a move which did not occur.|$|E
5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it was out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} show {{a famous}} incident {{from the life}} of Saint Francis of Assisi, who is shown kneeling by a rock as he receives the stigmata of the crucified Christ on the palms <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> soles of his feet. Behind him are rock formations, shown in great detail, and a panoramic landscape that seems to relegate the figures to secondary importance. This treatment of Francis is the first such to appear in northern Renaissance art. The arguments attributing the works to van Eyck are circumstantial and based mainly on the style and quality of the panels. A later, third version is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, but is weaker and strays significantly in tone and design.|$|E

25|$|In the Mechanics Magazine Robertson first {{proposed}} the London Mechanics' Institution. The idea was shortly taken out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> those of Hodgskin, {{by a group}} around George Birkbeck. Robertson became a long term critic of the Institution.|$|E
25|$|The loss <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> serious {{diminution}} of his eyesight apparently resulted in Heim acquiring an eidetic, acoustic memory. He was claimed to rarely forget a formula if {{he heard it}} recited, and {{was said to be}} able to learn a language in a matter of days. He married a former concert singer from Prague in 1950 named Gerda.|$|E
60|$|He made sinuous {{movements}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} Marjorie with that wooden yet expressive smile.|$|R

25|$|When the American Civil War {{erupted in}} 1861, Hoff {{volunteered for the}} U.S. Army and was {{assigned}} as Surgeon, with the rank of Major, to the 3rd New York Infantry Regiment. He participated in the Battle of Big Bethel, where a lamp was shot out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> others in the Eastern Theater. He became Brigade Surgeon on August 3, 1861 and {{was transferred to the}} command of Maj. Gen. John C. Fremont in Missouri.|$|E
25|$|That January RJ Lamont {{started the}} Omineca Express and {{delivered}} mail from Omineca to Quesnel using a dog team. His first round trip took him six weeks: he left Quesnel on January 31, arrived at Vital Creek {{and returned to}} Quesnel on March 16 with part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> face frozen. Nevertheless, he continued this service throughout {{the spring and summer}} of 1870, handling the Omineca mail for Wells Fargo and Barnard's Express. Each letter sent to or from the goldfields cost the sender a whopping $2.50.|$|E
25|$|The {{easiest way}} to breathe during breaststroke is to let the head follow the spine. When the swimmer's elbows have reached the line of his eye and have begun to rise, his head starts to lift. If he uses his high elbows as a hinge for the inward sweep <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> forearms, he will create the {{leverage}} he needs to use his abdominal muscles to bring his hips forward. When his hips move forward, his chest, shoulders and upper back will automatically lift up. Breathing is usually done during {{the beginning of the}} insweep phase of the arms, and the swimmer breathes in ideally through the mouth. The swimmer breathes out through mouth and nose during the recovery and gliding phase. Breaststroke can be swum faster if submerged completely, but FINA requires the head to break the surface once per cycle except for the first cycle after the start and each turn. Thus, competitive swimmers usually make one underwater pull-out, pushing the hands {{all the way to the}} back after the start and each turn.|$|E

25|$|Florida {{entered the}} 2012 matchup with their arch-rivals holding a 7–0 {{record and a}} No. 2 ranking while Georgia came in 6–1 and ranked No. 12, making the contest a key game {{in the race for}} the SEC East title. Both teams {{featured}} had strong defenses and ball control offenses, so the contest was unsurprisingly low scoring. Florida was down 17–9 late in the 4th quarter when they mounted a potential game-tying drive deep into Georgia territory. Gator quarterback Jeff Driskel completed a pass over the middle to tight end Jordan Reed, who appeared to be heading to the endzone before Bulldog outside line-backer Jarvis Jones punched the ball out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> Georgia recovered in the back of the endzone for a touchback. The lost fumble was Florida's sixth turnover of the game and allowed Georgia to hold on for the win. The teams finished the regular season tied for first in the SEC East with identical 7–1 records in conference play, but by virtue of their head-to-head victory over the Gators the Bulldogs advanced to the SEC Championship game, losing to eventual BCS national champion Alabama.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} avoid a big kickoff return, Matt Prater kicked the second half kickoff short, hitting {{the ground at the}} Seattle 12-yard line. But it did not stop Harvin from picking the ball out of the air and taking off for an 87-yard {{touchdown}} return that increased Seattle's lead to 29–0. The touchdown took place 12 seconds into the second half, exactly {{the same amount of time}} that the Seahawks took to score the safety in the first half. It was also the first time that consecutive Super Bowls had kickoff returns for touchdowns (Jacoby Jones' return in Super Bowl XLVII being the previous one, which was also the second half opening kickoff). After an exchange of punts, Eric Decker gave Denver good field position with a 9-yard return to the Denver 45. Two plays later, Manning completed a 23-yard pass to Demaryius Thomas, but cornerback Byron Maxwell knocked the ball out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> Malcolm Smith recovered it, returning the ball seven yards. An unnecessary roughness penalty against Denver added 15 more yards onto the end of the play, giving Seattle the ball at the Denver 42-yard line. Two plays later, Russell Wilson hit tight end Luke Willson for a 12-yard completion on third-and-7 and later completed a 19-yard pass to Ricardo Lockette. On the next play, he threw a short pass to Jermaine Kearse, who broke four tackles as he took off for a 23-yard touchdown reception bringing the score to 36–0.|$|E
500|$|Jesé {{was born}} to Pascual Rodríguez, a {{pharmacy}} worker, and María Ruiz. When he joined Real Madrid {{at the age of}} 14, Jesé made a promise to his father that he would help him retire by pursuing a career in football. The day after he signed his first professional contract with Real Madrid, Jesé's father was able to retire from the pharmacy at which he worked. He has the names of his parents tattooed on the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> in 2014 bought them a house in Gran Canaria.|$|E

500|$|St Francis lived austerely, in {{imitation}} of Christ. He embraced the natural world, and took vows of poverty, charity and chastity. In 1224 at La Verna, he experienced the mystical vision which van Eyck portrays. Thomas of Celano, author of Francis's hagiography, describes the vision and stigmatization: [...] "Francis had a vision in which he saw a man like a seraph: he had six wings and was standing above him with his hands outstretched and his feet bound together, and was fixed to a cross. Two wings were lifted above his head, and two were spread ready for flight, and two covered his whole body. When Francis saw this he was utterly amazed. He could not fathom what this vision might mean." [...] As he meditated, [...] "marks of nails began to appear {{on his hands and}} feet... His hands and feet seemed to be pierced by nails appearing on the inside <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> the upper side of his feet... His right side was scarred {{as if it had been}} pierced by a spear, and it often seeped blood." [...] To the medieval observer, the appearance of the stigmata signifies Francis's complete absorption in the vision of the seraph.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning {{at the age}} of three, Onley battled with polio, {{resulting}} in partial paralysis. However, as a result of extensive physical therapy, he regained the use <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> arms, and partial use of his legs. [...] Onley is able to walk using leg braces and canes or crutches, but he generally prefers to get around using his electric scooter. [...] He is able to drive a car using hand controls for acceleration and braking.|$|E
2500|$|The Steelers took {{possession}} at {{the start}} of the second quarter and advanced to their own 48-yard line. [...] On the next play, Dallas linebackers Mike Hegman and Thomas [...] "Hollywood" [...] Henderson went after Bradshaw on a blitz. After taking the snap, Bradshaw collided with Franco Harris and the ball popped loose. Bradshaw scooped it up and rolled to his right, looking to pass, but Henderson wrapped him up before he could throw, while Hegman ripped the ball out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> returned the fumble 37 yards for a touchdown, giving the Cowboys a 14–7 lead.|$|E

2500|$|In 1993, Emerson {{was forced}} to take a year off from playing after he {{developed}} a nerve-related condition affecting his right hand that he likened to [...] "writer's cramp" [...] and that was also reported {{as a form of}} arthritis. According to Emerson, this coincided with his divorce, his Sussex home burning down, and financial difficulties. During his time off, he ran marathons, customised a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, and wrote film scores and his autobiography, Pictures of an Exhibitionist, which opens and closes with an account of his illness and subsequent arm operation. By 2002 he had regained full use <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> could play to his usual strength.|$|E
2500|$|Generally, {{rather than}} lifting the {{opponent}} or throwing him for grand amplitude {{in order to}} win the period as in the international styles, the collegiate wrestler most often seeks to take his opponent down to the mat and perform a [...] "breakdown" [...] (that is, to get his opponent in the defensive position flat on his stomach or side). With the opponent off of his base of support (that is, off <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees), the collegiate wrestler in the offensive position would then seek to run pinning combinations, or combinations of techniques designed to secure a fall. Failing to gain a fall could still result in an advantage in riding time and potential nearfall points.|$|E
2500|$|I {{thought it}} was {{absolutely}} {{the worst thing that}} could possibly hit, I mean worst. It was so unlike anything that it had to be incredible. It was new, it was something that wasn't being done. ... So try to imagine, in a small rehearsal studio, four guys are up there playing. In front of them are Bill, Neil, Joyce, and myself. They finished the first song and no applause. Gene (Simmons) walks down to Neil Bogart, grabs both <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> makes him applaud ... and Neil started applauding because he was scared to death. And I said to myself at that moment, [...] "This I wanna be involved in" ... because that's the kind of balls you have to have to do anything.|$|E
