But these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a low point in the cohesion of the organization, and <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> subsided quickly after the short-term supply disruptions.

5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global <b>oil</b> <b>prices.</b> This is partly because it took several years to reach full production and partly because U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS production increases. <b>Oil</b> <b>prices</b> remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of price controls, and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. oil production. As North Slope oil production declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. oil production.|$|E

30|$|Cunado and de Gracia (2005) analyse {{the real}} and inflationary effects of <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks for six Asian {{countries}} including Malaysia within the Granger causality framework. In the analysis, various non-linear transformations of <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> are employed. They find evidence that <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks anticipate future variations in output growth and inflation especially when the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> is expressed in local currencies. For the case of Malaysia, when the US dollar <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> is used, none of the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> measures is found to Granger cause inflation.

Fairbanks became a supply point for exploitation of the oil field and for construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which caused a boom unseen since {{the first years of}} Fairbanks' founding and helped the town recover from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood. Fairbanks became a government center in the late 1960s with the establishment of the Fairbanks North Star Borough, which took Fairbanks as its borough seat. A drop in <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> during the 1980s caused a recession in the Fairbanks area, but the city gradually recovered as <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> climbed during the 1990s.

Amidst high <b>oil</b> <b>prices,</b> geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the tanker shipping market for the year.

40|$|Although <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks {{have long}} been viewed {{as one of the}} leading {{candidates}} for explaining U.

We provide a formal analysis of this question with special attention to the possible role of net <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> increases in amplifying the transmission of <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks. We quantify the conditional recessionary effect of <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks in the net <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> increase model for all episodes of net <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> increases since the mid- 1970 s. Compared to the linear model, the cumulative effect of <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks over course of the next two years is much larger in the net <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> increase model. For example, <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks explain a 3 % cumulative reduction in U. S. real GDP in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s and a 5 % cumulative reduction during the financial crisis. An obvious concern is that some of these estimates are an artifact of net <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> increases being correlated with other variables that explain recessions. We show that the explanatory power of <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks largely persists even after augmenting the nonlinear model with a measure of credit supply conditions, of the monetary policy stance and of consumer confidence. There is evidence, however, that the conditional fit of the net <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> increase model is worse on average than the fit of the corresponding linear model, suggesting much smaller cumulative effects of <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks for these episodes of at most 1 %...|$|R

5|$|The {{formation}} of OPEC marked {{a turning point}} toward national sovereignty over natural resources, and OPEC decisions have come to play {{a prominent role in}} the global oil market and international relations. The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> and OPEC's revenue and wealth, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the 1980s, OPEC started setting production targets for its member nations; and generally when the production targets are reduced, <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> increase, most recently from the organization's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{macroeconomic}} effects of <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> changes and of <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> uncertainty have mainly focused on real economic outcomes, such as employment, consumption and aggregate output. This paper investigates {{the links between}} the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> changes and the consumer confidence in Canada, at both the national and the regional levels, using the correlation analysis and least square econometric methods. The results of this paper suggest the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> declines mainly affect the consumer confidence about the overall employment and about the overall buying conditions of durable goods. More specifically, the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> declines have negative impacts on the consumer confidence about the overall employment in Canada. However, the impacts on the consumer confidence about the overall buying conditions of durable goods differ in the oil-producing regions and the oil-consuming regions. For the minority of the regions in Canada, the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> changes affect the consumer confidence about the household financial positions. In addition, several <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> transformations are examined in this paper. The introduction of the asymmetric <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> changes reveals that the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> declines are more important in affecting the consumer confidence about the employment expectation than the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> rises. Although different levels of the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> volatility might not affect the consumer confidence, the higher is the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> volatility, the more sensitive is the consumer confidence to the <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> changes of the same size...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} the oil price-industrial production nexus in Thailand by using multivariate cointegration test. In addition, Granger causality {{is also used}} to examine the impact of <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> uncertainty on industrial production growth. The main focus of this paper is on one sector of the economy, i. e., manufacturing sector. Monthly data from 1993 to 2015 are utilized. Empirical results reveal that there is a long-run relationship between industrial production and real <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> and other variables. Industrial production adjusts rapidly to shocks to lending rate, <b>price</b> level and <b>oil</b> <b>price.</b> Furthermore, there exists long-run causality running from lending rate, <b>price</b> level and <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> to industrial production. However, industrial production growth does not respond to <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shock and <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> uncertainty. Asymmetric and nonlinear relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shock and industrial output growth is not found. These findings give some policy implications. Keywords.
