5000|$|In Authentication, risk-based {{authentication}} is a non-static {{authentication system}} which {{takes into account}} the profile of the agent requesting access to the system to determine the risk profile associated with that transaction. The risk profile is then used to determine the complexity of the challenge. Higher risk profiles leads to stronger challenges, whereas a static username/password may suffice for lower-risk profiles. Risk-based implementation allows the application to challenge the user for additional credentials only when the risk level is appropriate. Machine authentication is often used in a risk based authentication set up. The machine authentication will run in the background and only ask the customer for additional authentication if the computer is not recognized. In a risk based authentication system, the institution decides if additional authentication is necessary. If the risk is deemed appropriate, enhanced authentication will be triggered, such as a <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>password</b> delivered via an out of band communication. Risk based authentication can also be used during the session to prompt for additional authentication when the customer performs a certain high risk transaction, such as a money transfer or an address change. Risk based authentication is very beneficial to the customer because additional steps are only required if something is out of the ordinary, such as the login attempt is from a new machine.|$|E

Static text based authentication are most widely employed authentication systems for being inexpensive and highly scalable. But they are prone to various types of active and passive attacks.

The system is particularly suited for mobile and constrained devices having limited computational power. 1...|$|E

Since data and applications are moved into cloud data centers, which run on virtual computing in the form of virtual machine, there are a number of security challenges which are yet to be met. With that development, the security to access the cloud also need to be tightened, not just to rely on usernames and passwords but also to the dynamic code of the mobile token which is difficult to be cracked. Dynamic mobile token is an application which is planted in the mobile phone to generate a code that was formed by the method of <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>password</b> and can only be used for one login session or transaction. In this technique, mobile phone will run a MIDLET which is responsible to produce <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>password</b> which is valid for short period of time.

Nevertheless, providing such a <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>password</b> {{is not really a}} strong authentication proof because the token generating the passwords can be given by an impostor. In order to cope with this problem, biometric recognition is more and more employed. Even if biometric data are strongly linked with the user, their revocability nor diversity is possible, without an adapted post-processing. Biometric template protection schemes, including the BioHashing algorithm, are used to manage the underlying privacy and security issues. These schemes are used for the protection of several biometric modalities, but are not necessary adapted for all of them. In this paper, we propose a new protocol combining protected biometric data and a classical synchronous <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>password</b> to enhance the security of user authentication while preserving usability and privacy.
