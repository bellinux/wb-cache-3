25|$|William Ball's 1976 American Conservatory Theater production, {{starring}} Fredi <b>Olster</b> and Marc Singer. This celebrated {{production was}} grounded {{very much in}} commedia dell'arte, with acrobats, clowns, pantomime-style violence, over-the-top posturing (Petruchio is depicted shirtless for almost the entire performance), much highly choreographed physicality {{on the part of}} the two leads, and an on-stage audience of clowns who provided on-going sound-effects, such as drums for punches and whistles for people fainting. This production dropped Sly altogether. Katherina's final speech is delivered in an ironic manner, with <b>Olster</b> winking at the audience, before grabbing a confused Petruchio and kissing him passionately. The production was broadcast by PBS in 1976 as part of their Great Performances series, with the TV presentation directed by Kirk Browning.|$|E

50|$|Critical sources usually {{point out}} that That Hamilton Woman was Winston Churchill's {{favorite}} film. In her research on the subject, film historian Professor Stacey <b>Olster</b> reveals {{that at the time}} the film was made, Alexander Korda’s New York offices were “supplying cover to MI-5 agents gathering intelligence on both German activities in the United States and isolationist sentiments among makers of American foreign policy.” According to Anthony Holden, Olivier’s biographer, That Hamilton Woman “became Exhibit A in a case brought against Korda by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Committee had accused him of operating an espionage and propaganda center for Britain in the United States—a charge Korda only escaped by virtue of the fact that his scheduled appearance before the committee on December 12, 1941 was preempted by the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor five days earlier".|$|E
40|$|A new algorithm, {{optimized}} land {{surface temperature}} and emissivity retrieval (<b>OLSTER),</b> {{is presented to}} compensate for atmospheric effects and retrieve land surface temperature (LST) and emissivity from airborne thermal infrared hyperspectral data. The <b>OLSTER</b> algorithm is designed to retrieve properties of both natural and man-made materials. Multi-directional or multi-temporal observations are not required, and the scenes {{do not have to}} be dominated by blackbody features. The <b>OLSTER</b> algorithm consists of a preprocessing step, an iterative search for nearblackbody pixels, and an iterative constrained optimization loop. The preprocessing step provides initial estimates of LST per pixel and the atmospheric parameters of transmittance and upwelling radiance for the entire image. Pixels that are under- or overcompensated by the estimated atmospheric parameters are classified as near-blackbody and lower emissivity pixels, respectively. A constrained optimization of the atmospheric parameters using generalized reduced gradients on the near-blackbody pixels ensures physical results. The downwelling radiance is estimated from the upwelling radiance by applying a look-up table of coefficients based on a polynomial regression of radiative transfer model runs for the same sensor altitude. The LST and emissivity per pixel are retrieved simultaneously using the well established ISSTES algorithm. The <b>OLSTER</b> algorithm retrieves land surface temperatures within about ± 1. 0 K, and emissivities within about ± 0. 01 based on numerical simulation and validation work comparing results from sensor data with ground truth measurements. The <b>OLSTER</b> algorithm is currently one of only a few algorithms available that have been documented to retrieve accurate land surface temperatures and absolute land surface spectral emissivities from passive airborne hyperspectral LWIR sensor imagery...|$|E

40|$|This PhD thesis, {{participating}} in the burgeoning interest in Mailer's prolific achievement in his mature years, examines three ironies attending his career: that his leftist, antiwar writer has recently {{been described as a}} literary imperialist and as a proponent of a fascistic aesthetic, that he has been the target of feminists and gender theorists despite the fact that his writings reveal his longstanding engagement with the psychology of gender, and that he is commonly regarded as a Manichean writer, even though some defining components of this near-ancient recasting of Zoroastrianism hardly apply to his religious/existential ideas. Chapter One, a study of Mailer's neglected Egypt novel, offers a Jungian-archetypal reading of Ancient Evenings (1983) while examining allegations that Mailer's brand of masculinity, labeled "rogue" (Faludi, 1999) and "imperialist (Savran 1998), evinces the "frontier psychology" (<b>Olster</b> 1989) that is synonymous with the fascistic attitudes attributed to him by feminists in the 1970 s (Millet, 1971; Fetterley, 1978). Chapter Two, arguing that Tough Guys Don't Dance (1984) represents Mailer's subtle response to these allegations, claims that the novel gestures exoterically to the hard-boiled tradition [...] -its title and main characters invoke David Madden's Tough Guys Writers of the Thirties (1968) [...] -and esoterically to Reich's and Adorno's ideas about socio-biological constructions of gender. Mailer's achievement in Tough Guys resides in the ways in which he restores to the genre of mystery fiction the psychological elements that are usually lacking in its subgenre, the hard-boiled tradition of detective writing. Chapter Three treats The Gospel According to the Son (1997) as a "gnostic" narrative in which the narrator, in reconciling his Judaic and pagan inheritances, achieves a synthesis between Platonic and Aristotelian principles, embodies the reasons that Mailer referred to himself as a "left-medievalist. " This synthesis, implicit in the novel's many dualisms, in Satan's dramatic role and in the fact that Mailer incorporates an esoteric passage deriving from The Gospel of Mary, qualifies the critic's tendency to label the prodigal and iconoclastic Mailer as Manichean [...] -a commonplace in Mailer studies since the 1950 s. As I argue in this chapter, Mailer's Gospel, if only because it participates in current debates about the meaning of the term "Gnosticism," warrants greater critical attention...|$|E
