5|$|Prolonged skin {{contact with}} {{glacial acetic acid}} may result in tissue destruction. Inhalation {{exposure}} (eight hours) to acetic acid vapours at 10 ppm can produce some irritation <b>of</b> <b>eyes,</b> nose, and throat; at 100 ppm marked lung irritation and possible damage to lungs, eyes, and skin may result. Vapour concentrations of 1,000 ppm cause marked irritation <b>of</b> <b>eyes,</b> nose and upper respiratory tract and cannot be tolerated. These predictions were based on animal experiments and industrial exposure. Skin sensitization to acetic acid is rare, but has occurred.|$|E

5|$|At {{one year}} of age, joint {{attention}} is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an intentional act. One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see. At age 15 months, children recognize the minds of others. At this age, children also recognize the importance <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> for seeing and that physical objects can block sight. At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention. 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the mentalistic experience of seeing and the role <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision. At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well. Two-year-olds are also capable of representational thought or increased memory.|$|E

5|$|During evolution, some {{structures}} {{may lose}} their original function and become vestigial structures. Such structures {{may have little}} or no function in a current species, yet have a clear function in ancestral species, or other closely related species. Examples include pseudogenes, the non-functional remains <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> in blind cave-dwelling fish, wings in flightless birds, the presence of hip bones in whales and snakes, and sexual traits in organisms that reproduce via asexual reproduction. Examples of vestigial structures in humans include wisdom teeth, the coccyx, the vermiform appendix, and other behavioural vestiges such as goose bumps and primitive reflexes.|$|E

40|$|Lack <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> {{contact is}} one of the key {{clinical}} observations in schizophrenia. Sixteen schizophrenic patients and sixteen control subjects participated in our study <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> gazing. Frequencies <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> contact <b>of</b> both groups were measured in a role-play test which is closer to a natural environment. Autistic traits of both groups were measured using the Autism Quotient Questionnaire. We hypothesized that patients’ frequencies <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> contact were fewer than control subjects. We anticipated that patient group would score high in AQ. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between frequency <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> contact and cognitive functioning and symptomatology. Lastly, the study also examined the relationship between frequency <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> contact and autistic traits. Result showed that patients’ eye contact were significantly fewer than control group. Patients’ overall cognitive functioning was not as good as control group. In addition, schizophrenic patients scored significantly higher than control group in the Autism Quotient Questionnaire; autistic traits were found in schizophrenia patients. There was no relationship between frequency <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> contact and cognitive functioning. Nonetheless, negative correlation was found between frequency <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> contact and Digital symbol. More eye contact was associated with lower Digital symbol score. No relationship was found between frequency <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> contact and Autism quotient. Lastly, a trend correlation was found between frequency <b>of</b> <b>eye</b> contact and PANSS negative score; more eye contact was associated with higher PANSS negative score. published_or_final_versionPsychological MedicineMasterMaster of Psychological Medicin...|$|R

5|$|In September 1943, the Los Alamos Laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, {{arranged}} for von Neumann to visit Los Alamos and investigate implosion {{with a fresh}} set <b>of</b> <b>eyes.</b> After reviewing Neddermeyer's studies, and discussing the matter with Edward Teller, von Neumann suggested the use of high explosive in shaped charges to implode a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of fissile material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly {{reduce the amount of}} material required. The prospect of more efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller and Hans Bethe, but they decided that an expert on explosives was required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and he was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.|$|E
5|$|Like all jumping spiders, M. inclemens has {{excellent}} vision.

5|$|Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers, found {{throughout}} the game in unmarked chests (white chests in Ascension), increase {{the maximum amount of}} health and magic, respectively. Minotaur Horns, which increase the Items and Fire meter's maximum length, are available in God of War III and Ghost of Sparta, respectively. The Items meter allows the use of secondary weapons, called Items, and the Fire meter allows the use of Thera's Bane. The meters are increased in increments and reach their maximum once a certain number <b>of</b> <b>Eyes,</b> Feathers, and Horns are found. Other chests contain green, blue, or red orbs. Green orbs replenish the player's health, blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage, and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic for new, more powerful attacks, and replenish the Rage meter in God of War. Gold orbs found in God of War II and Ascension, and white orbs in God of War III, replenish the Rage meter instead of red orbs; the Rage meter in Ascension is also refilled by landing attacks on foes. Chests with changing colors, which allow players to choose which meter to replenish, have also been available. Red orbs can also be collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. Bosses and more powerful opponents release a combination of colored orbs when killed via the quick-time feature.|$|E
5|$|Most {{worker and}} soldier {{termites}} are completely blind {{as they do}} not have a pair <b>of</b> <b>eyes.</b> However, some species, such as Hodotermes mossambicus, have compound eyes which they use for orientation and to distinguish sunlight from moonlight. The alates have eyes along with lateral ocelli. Lateral ocelli, however, are not found in all termites. Like other insects, termites have a small tongue-shaped labrum and a clypeus; the clypeus is divided into a postclypeus and anteclypeus. Termite antennae have a number of functions such as the sensing of touch, taste, odours (including pheromones), heat and vibration. The three basic segments of a termite antenna include a scape, a pedicel (typically shorter than the scape), and the flagellum (all segments beyond the scape and pedicel). The mouth parts contain a maxillae, a labium, and a set of mandibles. The maxillae and labium have palps that help termites sense food and handling.|$|E
5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E

5|$|Players must guide a {{boy scout}} through a 43-room mansion {{in order to}} obtain 16 keys and a {{combination}} before running out of time. These unlock a safe containing the pills needed to save the mansion owner's life. It is necessary to jump onto platforms and evade enemies in order to progress. At the start of the game the player has three lives; a life is lost should the boy scout fall too far or come into contact with one of the mansion's servants or traps. Rooms contain doors that can be entered to move around the mansion, as well as push buttons and hazards. Pressing buttons can result in lifts being activated, platforms appearing or in an enemy appearing. One of the mansion's rooms is a corridor of eight doors with a large pair <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> above them; this room acts as a maze. A tune is played continuously during play, but can be toggled on or off.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} position <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> is highly variable within the species. For example, eye location ranges from being completely within the antennal scrobes to completely outside the scrobes. In {{some cases the}} eye itself is located outside the antennal scrobe, but the eye's fossa is well marked and confluent with the antennal scrobe. In most specimens, the antennal carina (ridge extending along the dorsal antennal region) bifurcates from the antennal scrobes and lies straight above the eyes. However, in specimens from Nicaragua, a strongly impressed antennal carina is present. In these specimens about 40% of the eye's area lies within the antennal scrobes. In the gyne, only ~1/6 of the eye lies within the antennal scrobes. A depression sometimes forms in the integument in {{the sides of the}} propodeum, below the propodeal spiracle and above the metapleural gland. The depth of this depression varies among specimens and tends to be deepest in larger specimens.|$|E
