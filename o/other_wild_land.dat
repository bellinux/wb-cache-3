6000|$|I {{know not}} {{whether it was}} to this [...] "Peach War," [...] and the {{acquisitions}} of Indian land which may have grown out of it, that we may ascribe the first seeds {{of the spirit of}} [...] "annexation" [...] which now began to manifest themselves. Hitherto the ambition of the worthy burghers had been confined to the lovely island of Manna-hata; and Spiten Devil on the Hudson, and Hell-gate on the Sound, were to them the pillars of Hercules, the ne plus ultra of human enterprise. Shortly after the Peach War however, a restless spirit was observed among the New Amsterdammers, who began to cast wistful looks upon the <b>wild</b> <b>lands</b> of their Indian neighbors; for somehow or <b>other</b> <b>wild</b> Indian <b>land</b> always looks greener in the eyes of settlers than the land they occupy. It is hinted that Oloffe the Dreamer encouraged these notions; having, as has been shown, the inherent spirit of a land speculator, which had been wonderfully quickened and expanded since he had become a landholder. Many of the common people, who had never before owned a foot of land, now began to be discontented with the town lots which had fallen to their shares; others who had snug farms and tobacco plantations found they had not sufficient elbow-room, and began to question the rights of the Indians to the vast regions they pretended to hold--while the good Oloffe indulged in magnificent dreams of foreign conquest and great patroonships in the wilderness.|$|R

40|$|In {{a country}} such as Scotland, {{there is little}} land, if any, that has escaped the {{influence}} of humankind {{in one way or}} another. The degree of human influence varies along a continuum from, for example, the city centre office block, to a very remote mountain hilside. Despite the effects of human influence, the landscapes at the latter end of the continuum are stil perceived by many as wild and are relatively untouched. <b>Wild</b> <b>land</b> is valued for both utilitarian and intrinsic reasons and provides a range of benefits. However, owing to the subjective nature of current <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> definitions, these values and benefits are rarely taken into account in current land use management and new developments. The aim {{of this study was to}} define in spatial terms the concept of <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> in Scotland using people's visual perceptions of the landscape. This was achieved through the development of a method to define objectively <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> by quantifying the wildness of a location based on the surrounding landscape attributes. The main objectives of the study were an assessment of the physical and perceptual characteristics of <b>wild</b> <b>land,</b> the examination of the current wildness of a range of Scottish areas which in turn enabled the stability of <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> perceptions over time to be evaluated in comparison with existing data. The perceptual nature of <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> necessitates a multidisciplinary approach and requires a broad range of opinion to be consulted in its definition. The use of a photographic questionnaire enabled the views of those living nearby and visiting potential <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> areas to be gathered. The photographs represented the range of characteristic landscape attributes within the two study areas of the Cairngorms and Wester Ross, and were rated for their wildness. The extent of visible landscape attributes was quantified using a geographical information system (G. I. S.) and was used along with wildness ratings to develop and test predictive wildness models using multiple linear regression techniques. Wildness models were then applied within each of the two study areas, producing maps of <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> that could then be used in decisions on future planning and conservation issues...|$|R

6000|$|His {{observations}} were certainly somewhat crude, {{but the little}} quiver in his voice got hold of those who heard him, and once more the big building rang with cheering. As the sound of hearty acclamation died away {{there was a great}} clatter of thrust-back benches through which the tuning of a fiddle broke. Then out of the tentative twang of strings rose, clear and silvery, the lament of Flora Macdonald, thrilling with melancholy, and there were men and women there whose hearts went back to the <b>other</b> <b>wild</b> and misty <b>land</b> of rock and pine and frothing river which they had left far away across the sea. It may be that the musician desired a contrast, or that he was merely feeling for command of the instrument, for the plaintive melody that ran from shift to shift into a thin elfin wailing far up the sobbing strings broke off suddenly, and was followed by the crisp jar of crashing chords. Then [...] "The Flowers of Edinburgh" [...] rang out with Caledonian verve in it and a mad seductive swing, and the guests streamed out {{to the middle of the}} floor. That they had just eaten an excellent supper was a matter of no account with them.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{sets out}} the general {{background}} context surrounding {{the issue of}} <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> in Scotland. It explores definitions of <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> and related concepts, identifies key issues associated with <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> in Scotland, and explores {{the question of the}} desirability of designating areas as <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> for Scotland. There is increasing interest in the concept of ‘wild land’, ‘wildness’, or ‘wilderness’ in Scotland, other parts of the UK and Europe. Changes in agricultural policy are leading to land abandonment in several European Union member states and in some cases ‘re-wilding’ is taking place with little or no managerial input from humans. These events have led to renewed interest across Europe in setting aside land with minimal management to create ‘wild’ areas. There has been either interest or activity, not always in the public sector, in Italy, Spain, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and the Netherlands in exploring and establishing some form of <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> area. Many of these are relatively small, with evidence of recent human activity, and, as such, are quite distinct from the concept of ‘wilderness’, which has been so influential in certain parts of the world (such as North America) in influencing the designation of areas of land for minimal management. In contrast there are the large areas of northern Scandinavia, which still contain ‘wilderness-like’ qualities, and to some extent are preserved in the wilderness areas and national parks of Finland, Sweden and Norway. Unfortunately, the terms ‘wild land’, ‘wildness’, ‘wilderness’, come with an enormous amount of associated cultural baggage, resulting in argument and conflict over definitions, purpose, and management of potential <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> or wilderness areas. The aim {{of this paper is to}} unpack some of that baggage and clarify the key issues in the current discussions on <b>wild</b> <b>land</b> taking place in Scotland...|$|R

50|$|While Kellen {{is there}} he meets Atroist, another wild mage {{who lives in}} the <b>wild</b> <b>lands</b> near where the demons are. Kellen wants him and the <b>other</b> <b>wild</b> mages of the <b>wild</b> <b>lands</b> (there are more wild mages there than any other place because that is where they are needed most) to come help. Atroist does not want to leave the people because the demons would easily kill them. So Kellen comes up with a plan. He wants the elves to allow safe passage for the wild folk through their lands since the folk can go into the wild woods where they will be safe. Atroist agrees and says if the people are safe, all the wild mages will come and fight for them. They have to get {{permission}} first and petition the council. The council responds that they will debate it. While Kellen is there he meets the leader of the army, General Redhelwar. While the council debates, the elves go to war against the shadow elves. They go to their first shadow elf village, the place where they held the children. The elf army easily kills them with Vestakia's help. The elves at first are hesitant to kill them, because they are part elf. Kellen still thinks this is a distraction by the demons.|$|R

50|$|Faid was {{somewhat}} less successful in keeping its grazing rights in Cochem’s <b>wild</b> <b>lands.</b> About 1840, Cochem claimed that Faid {{had no such}} rights, and forbade the villagers to graze their livestock there. Nevertheless, they once again ignored an official pronouncement, and the village shepherd continued to graze his sheep in the <b>wild</b> <b>lands,</b> for which offence he was booked and subsequently penalized by the court. The village then decided to send a delegation to Trier to seek the old documents granting them grazing rights in the <b>wild</b> <b>lands</b> in the old Electoral archive. The delegates were turned away and told that the more recent Prussian administration had had all such documents transferred to Koblenz. No such thing was to be found there, however, and Faid thereby lost its grazing rights in Cochem’s <b>wild</b> <b>lands.</b> As it later turned out, no delegation had ever needed to go anywhere. In 1887 - somewhat {{too late for the}} delegation’s purposes - the document that had been sought was found - in Faid’s own municipal chest.|$|R
