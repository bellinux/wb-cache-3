5000|$|The overall {{problems}} of stovepiping and encouraging cross-functional teams, {{in the context}} of terrorism, has been addressed by, among other groups, the House Intelligence Committee. One of their chief recommendations was:FBI's main problem going forward is to overcome its information sharing failures. [...] "Ensuring adequate information sharing" [...] should be communicated throughout the Bureau as the Director's top priority, and a clear strategy incorporating the personnel dimension, the technical dimension, and the legal dimension of the information-sharing problem should be developed and communicated immediately.Their recommendations for the CIA included:CIA leadership must ensure that HUMINT collection remains a central core competency of the agency, and should develop additional operational tools, in conjunction with other appropriate agencies (FBI, etc,), penetrate terrorist cells, disrupt terrorist operations and capture and render terrorists to law enforcement as appropriate. More core collectors need to be put on the streets.ClA should ensure that a management structure is in place to steward the multiyear investments needed to build new platforms to collect on terrorist targets. CIA must also ensure sufficient numbers of unilateral CT slots in field stations and bases.CIA should lead an effort to improve watchlisting to ensure that all relevant agencies, including FBI, Homeland Security, and others, have access to a common database of up-to-date terrorist person-related data collected by US government agencies and <b>other</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>sources.</b> The creation of a terrorism watchlisting unit at CIA may be a useful first step.Require all new case officers and analysts to achieve a [...] "level 3" [...] language proficiency prior to initial deployment, and devise a mechanism for ensuring language skill maintenance is incentivized and directly tied to performance evaluation.CIA should take immediate and sustained steps to dramatically improve all aspects of its CT training program. Establish structures in CTC (Counterterrorism Center) in such a manner that ensures a normal career path for these officers. Incorporate counterterrorism-related skill development in all appropriate training for case officers and analysts. Internal policies, such as CTC's 'no threshold' threat reporting policy, should be reviewed and modified to ensure that consumers are getting the most reliable reporting and that sufficient analysis is applied to that product in advance of its wholesale dissemination, wherever possible.The 1995 guidelines must be rescinded immediately, and replaced with new guidelines that balance concerns about human rights behavior and law breaking with the need for flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to gather information on terrorist activities, as required by law.|$|E

40|$|Background: For over {{a decade}} {{isolated}} reports have noted liver histology and biochemistry changes in patients with coeliac disease. The prevalence and response to treatment is clinically important. Aim: To outline the frequency and significance of liver abnormalities in coeliac disease. Methods: A Medline search using Ovid-Coeliac/Coeliac (exp) and liver disease (exp) was completed of English references published during 1966 -June 2003. Bibliographic references and <b>other</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>sources</b> were also searched. Results: Six studies reported liver biochemistry in 591 patients; 248 patients had abnormal results. Elevated transaminases were the most frequently reported abnormality. A gluten-free diet produced resolution of elevated transaminases in 115 of 130 patients. There was a greater than expected association with primary biliary cirrhosis and advanced liver disease. Conclusions: Mildly abnormal liver biochemistry is frequent in untreated coeliac disease and may provide {{a key to the}} diagnosis. Routine investigations for undiagnosed liver disease should include tissue transglutaminase testing. Left untreated, coeliac-induced hepatitis may rarely progress to end-stage liver disease. Primary biliary cirrhosis is clearly linked to coeliac disease. The full story of these linkages is yet to be written...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the development and}} testing of a tool designed to support the decision making process for small and local schemes {{that do not have}} to proceed through to a full NATA 1 appraisal. It is also intended that it could be used with larger schemes to provide an initial indication of whether they are worth pursuing to the full appraisal stage. The small and local assessment tool allows users to select a set of indicators appropriate to their circumstances, weight the indicators in terms of importance, assess the impact of proposed project(s) against the indicators, and finally combine the weighting and assessment to derive a final score that will give an indication of whether a project is worth pursuing, or a priority list where more than one project is assessed. Packages of measures can also be assessed. A pick list of potential indicators is provided derived from the NATA appraisal, Local Transport Plan guidance, UK Best Value Performance indicators (BVPI) and <b>other</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>sources.</b> Users are also able to add in their own local indicators to the assessment.

40|$|The thesis aims at {{verification}} of using emerging Solid-State drives in disk arrays. The advent of SSD disks caused a small revolution in area of data storage, because the growth performance of hard drives {{has been slow}} compared to other PC components. But an entirely different principle of operation could mean compatibility problems between SSD and related technologies, such as RAID. This thesis aims at analyzing all the relevant technologies, mainly HDD, SSD and RAID. To achieve this objective, information from literature, articles and <b>other</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>sources</b> will be used. Other objectives of this thesis are {{to determine how much}} are the SSDs suitable for use in the disk array, because low performance RAID controllers or different principles of operation could limit their efficiency. This question should be answered by submission of selected types of storage arrays to synthetic and practical tests of performance. The final goal is to use financial analysis of the test solutions as a shared file storage. Today, remote access to data is used by a wide range of job positions. Slow storage could mean inefficient use of working time and therefore unnecessary financial costs. The goal of my work is primarily to provide answers to the questions mentioned above. Currently {{it is very hard to}} find tests of more complex forms of disk arrays based on solid-state drives. This article can be also very useful for companies where fileservers are used to share user data. Based on the result of cost analysis, the company can then decide what type of storage is best for its purpose...|$|E
40|$|India {{is one of}} {{the most}} diverse nations in the world. Comprised of 28 states, the country is home to a large number of ethnic groups {{residing}} in various parts of the nation. The wealth of cultural traditions and folk arts in the country are astounding. Proposed is a project to make a documentary film on the folk music of Rajasthan, a northwestern state in India. Traveling in India is like traveling to various countries. Each state has its own language, cultural traditions and art forms. This diversity {{is one of the}} key strengths of the country. India 2 Ì† 7 s folk art, reflected in music, dance and other forms, is amazing in its variety and resonates itself in the everyday lives of people. An integral part of society, folk art is present in the abundance of festivals, ceremonies and celebrations. While Indian classical music has established itself as a distinguished musical entity internationally, Indian folk music is still not that well known, even though it constitutes a vital part of everyday Indian life. The present project proposes to bring more awareness on this vibrant art form to the world through the audio-visual medium of film. For the present project I will be traveling to India in February 2011 to shoot the Desert Festival, held each year in the state of Rajasthan. Festivals are one of the optimum ways to capture a wide variety of Indian folk arts in a short amount of time. The Desert Festival is a 3 day festival where musicians from various parts of the state gather and perform. During this time I will not only be able to capture much music on film but, as well, be able to conduct interviews with musicians and possibly with <b>other</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>sources...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: In the {{regional}} movement toward ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), medical professions including physicians can be qualified to practice medicine in another country. Ensuring comparable, excellent medical qualification systems is crucial but {{the availability and}} analysis of relevant information has been lacking. Objective: This study had the following aims: 1) to comparatively analyze information on Medical Licensing Examinations (MLE) across ASEAN countries and 2) to assess stakeholdersâ€™ view on potential consequences of AEC on the medical profession from a Thai perspective. Design: To search for relevant information on MLE, we started with each country's national body as the primary data source. In case of lack of available data, secondary data sources including official websites of medical universities, colleagues in international and national medical student organizations, and some <b>other</b> <b>appropriate</b> Internet <b>sources</b> were used. Feasibility and concerns about validity and reliability of these sources were discussed among investigators. Experts in the region invited through HealthSpace. Asia conducted the final data validation. For the second objective, in-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} 13 Thai stakeholders, purposely selected based on a maximum variation sampling technique to represent the points of view of the medical licensing authority, the medical profession, ethicists and economists. Results: MLE systems exist in all ASEAN countries except Brunei, but vary greatly. Although the majority has a national MLE system, Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam accept results of MLE conducted at universities. Thailand adopted the USA's 3 -step approach that aims to check pre-clinical knowledge, clinical knowledge, and clinical skills. Most countries, however, require only one step. A multiple choice question (MCQ) is the most commonly used method of assessment; a modified essay question (MEQ) is the next most common. Although both tests assess candidate's knowledge, the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) is used to verify clinical skills of the examinee. The validity of the medical license and that it reflects a consistent and high standard of medical knowledge is a sensitive issue because of potentially unfair movement of physicians and an embedded sense of domination, at least from a Thai perspective. Conclusions: MLE systems differ across ASEAN countries in some important aspects that might be of concern from a fairness viewpoint and therefore should be addressed in the movement toward AEC...|$|R
