5|$|In November of that year, Agârbiceanu and {{his family}} found shelter with a Transylvanian family in Borogani village, near Leova in Bessarabia. The October Revolution soon broke <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> made {{their way back to}} Moldavia, where he became a {{military}} chaplain for the Hârlău-based Romanian Volunteer Corps in Russia. He returned to Orlat in December 1918. In March 1919, following the union of Transylvania with Romania, he was named director of Patria newspaper, which was edited by the province's Directing Council.|$|E
5|$|None of them played instruments, so I {{was left}} to do the music and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five pencils and pads came <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure the speed of light. Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of the speed of light in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of the speed of light.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Indiana Jones {{narrowly}} escapes {{the clutches}} of Lao Che, a crime boss in Shanghai, China. With his 11-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on an airplane that, unknown to them, is owned by Lao. While {{the three of them}} sleep on the plane, the pilots parachute <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> leave the plane to crash over the Himalayas while dumping its fuel. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover this and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft, and then riding down the slopes into a raging river. They come to Mayapore, a village in northern India, where the poor villagers believe them to have been sent by Shiva to retrieve the sacred sivalinga stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone {{may be one of the}} five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she will {{take the place of}} her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> kiss ("Coda").|$|E
5|$|The next day, Bart {{plans to}} reveal what he witnessed, but Seymour and Edna {{fear that they}} would be fired if anyone found <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> swear him to secrecy. They hire him as their gofer so they can {{secretly}} exchange messages. Bart agrees for a while because the reward for his cooperation is that Milhouse will inherit Bart's poor school record. Eventually, Bart grows frustrated about his home, school and social life continually being interrupted to help them advance their relationship, putting him in embarrassing situations. One afternoon at school, after he is embarrassed in front of his classmates by having to say one of Seymour's messages to Edna out loud, Bart bitterly gathers the entire school in front of a janitor's closet and he opens the door to reveal that Seymour and Edna are making out.|$|E

There are also times when Rowley is ashamed that he lied to Greg and was too ashamed to look at him, even when Greg is asking for help.|$|R

5|$|Naz and Asher go {{clubbing}} and {{get drunk}} and high on drugs, and though Sol sends her an apologetic text message, Asher deletes it before Naz sees it. Naz and Asher {{end up having}} sex, but he abandons her afterwards and Sol finds her and apologises. They reconcile but she feels guilty. The next day they wake up after spending {{the night in the}} same bed, and Naz later watches Sol at dance rehearsals. Asher returns a necklace to Naz, and Sol sees this. He confronts her about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. She insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. In an attempt to get Naz and Sol to reconcile again, Stevie pretends to swallow the key to the flat's front door, leaving them trapped. Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol angrily says she can stay there. When left alone, they get close again, but Asher interrupts them when he returns. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he sarcastically tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. She returns home and prepares to leave for Turkey but her father discovers she has escaped through a window. She returns to the flat but her father and Ekin come after her and try to take her back home. Sol stops the car and Naz gets <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> kiss. Later at the dance-off, she and her father talk and he finally accepts her choice of boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|Sol and Naz {{spend the}} night {{together}} but at later dance rehearsals, Asher gives Naz her necklace back, and Sol sees this. He confronts Naz about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. Sol punches Asher, saying his brother has betrayed him, and a fight breaks out, but is broken up by Skolla and the other dancers. Skolla tells Sol and Asher they are both out {{of the group and}} reveals that Asher bought Sol's place. Sol goes back home to his mother but a neighbour tells him she has been taken away. Back in Walford, Naz insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. Stevie attempts to get them to reconcile by locking them in the flat and pretending to swallow the key, but Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol says she can stay there. Sol and Naz get close again but Asher interrupts them when he returns drunk. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. Asher finds Sol with their mother in hospital, and tells Sol he is better off with him than their mother as she is schizophrenic and has stabbed Asher. Sol says Asher is the problem and leaves. Asher finds him and apologises for Naz and says she did not get Sol's text message because he deleted it, and tells Sol that Naz loves him and he should do something about it. Sol returns to Walford again as Naz is leaving, and stops Ekin's car. Naz gets <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> kiss. Asher tells him he can dance at the dance-off, but when his name is called, he is unsure and calls for Asher, saying he needs him. Asher tells him he can do it on his own. Everyone cheers him after his routine and he is called one of the best dancers.|$|E
25|$|He met his wife-to-be, Sharon Ryer, {{while on}} an {{airplane}} tending to official business in 1978. Ryer, a flight attendant for Pacific Southwest Airlines, was annoyed when Davis held up {{the departure of the}} flight from Sacramento to Los Angeles. Davis apologized and asked her <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> later married in 1983, with California Supreme Court Justice Rose Bird officiating.|$|E

Subsequently, they break up because Penny felt she was not as smart as Leonard would like.|$|E
25|$|The outer {{shells of}} in-ear {{headphones}} {{are made up}} of a variety of materials, such as plastic, aluminum, ceramic and other metal alloys. Because in-ear headphones engage the ear canal, they can be prone to sliding <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> block out much environmental noise. Lack of sound from the environment can be a problem when sound is a necessary cue for safety or other reasons, as when walking, driving, or riding near or in vehicular traffic.|$|E
25|$|On December 31, 1862, {{the first}} day of the Battle of Stones River, Sheridan {{anticipated}} a Confederate assault and positioned his division in preparation for it. His division held back the Confederate onslaught on his front until their ammunition ran <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were forced to withdraw. This action was instrumental in giving the Union army time to rally at a strong defensive position. For his actions, he was promoted to major general on April 10, 1863 (with date of rank December 31, 1862). In six months, he had risen from captain to major general.|$|E

As officials could find no evidence of any connections, terrorism as a motive was ruled <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> suggested that the crash was an apparent suicide. Bishop's mother filed, then dropped, a lawsuit claiming that an acne medicine Bishop took, isotretinoin, had side effects such as depression and suicidal actions, and caused the incident.|$|E
25|$|The New South Wales Country XI batted {{first and}} were all out for 221. Terry Bourke, an ex-New South Wales Colt, top-scored with 64, but seven other batsmen got into double figures in an all round effort. The {{part-time}} spinners Ken Barrington (6/92) and Peter Parfitt (2/57) {{did most of}} the bowling, but Barry Knight took 2/15. Knight (32) opened the batting with the wicketkeeper John Murray (25) and Parfitt made 36, but it was Barrington (61) and John Edrich (67 not out) who made the winning runs. They carried on batting after the win until Barrington was <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> match was called to an end.|$|E
25|$|Workers and the {{majority}} of males are reared in the first cells, which are small with a diameter for approximately 4mm. Large cells of about 6mm in diameter are constructed later in the season and queens and a few males are reared in these cells. Because queens and males, but not workers, were observed in a few frigid regions, Birula asserts that workers are not reared in extremely cold areas and that only queens and males are reared in such environments. Once the new males and queens leave the colony, workers slowly die <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> colony ceases to exist. Founded in spring and dying out in August, nests have a short annual cycle.|$|E

25|$|The French {{had hoped}} to catch the besieging army {{unprepared}} by moving out before dawn; however, the English 'border prickers' (light cavalry from the Scottish borders) were <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> detected {{the movement of the}} larger of the two bodies of French cavalry. Henry VIII drew up a field force from the siege lines sending out a vanguard of 1,100 cavalry, following this with 10,000–12,000 infantry. La Palice's force encountered English scouts at the village of Bomy, 5 miles from Thérouanne, the French, realising that the English were alert, checked themselves {{on the edge of a}} hillside. The stradiots then began their rather forlorn attempt to contact the garrison, riding in a wide arc towards the town.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Essex {{successfully}} defended their National League {{title in}} the newly rebranded Pro40 format by the narrowest of margins, having tied for the title on points. The club missed out on promotion in the County Championship only {{on the last day}} of the season, losing to Leicestershire while their rivals Worcestershire beat Northamptonshire. In that season's Twenty20 Cup Essex beat Yorkshire to reach the semi-finals at Trent Bridge, where they were beaten by eventual tournament winners Leicestershire. Essex also had Twenty20 success in the first floodlit Twenty20 Tournament, held between the four teams with permanent floodlights, in a series of 2 legged matches. Essex beat Derbyshire 1–0, after the first leg was washed <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> won the second leg convincingly.|$|E
25|$|Gandalf {{tells the}} party that Sauron will now turn his eye to Minas Tirith. Gandalf rides on ahead, and sends the party to the ruined city of Osgiliath, to stand {{alongside}} Boromir's brother, Faramir. As they await {{the arrival of the}} army, Berethor muses that Osgiliath seems familiar to him. Éoaden remembers a Gondorian warrior who fought under Boromir during the defense of the city some time ago, but who fled the battle in fear. The party realize that Berethor is that man. He vows he will never flee again, and the party join Faramir in a fight against Gothmog. They defeat him, but he flees before they can kill him. Gandalf then summons the party back to Minas Tirith. Before they leave, however, Berethor learns the reason he fled Osgiliath was because he was stabbed by a Morgul blade, the tip of which is still within him. He and Idrial face the Witch-king, but Idrial explains he cannot harm the Witch-king whilst the blade is still inside him. He cuts it <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> attack the Witch-king, driving him off. The party then head to Minas Tirith.|$|E
