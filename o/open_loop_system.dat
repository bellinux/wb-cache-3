50|$|In an <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>system</b> (also {{called a}} {{groundwater}} heat pump), the secondary loop pumps natural {{water from a}} well or body of water into a heat exchanger inside the heat pump. ASHRAE calls open loop systems groundwater heat pumps or surface water heat pumps, depending on the source. Heat is either extracted or added by the primary refrigerant loop, and the water is returned to a separate injection well, irrigation trench, tile field or body of water. The supply and return lines must be placed far enough apart to ensure thermal recharge of the source. Since the water chemistry is not controlled, the appliance {{may need to be}} protected from corrosion by using different metals in the heat exchanger and pump. Limescale may foul the system over time and require periodic acid cleaning. This is much more of a problem with cooling systems than heating systems. Also, as fouling decreases the flow of natural water, it becomes difficult for the heat pump to exchange building heat with the groundwater. If the water contains high levels of salt, minerals, iron bacteria or hydrogen sulfide, a closed loop system is usually preferable.|$|E

Background Fracking is the process of recovering natural gas trapped by shale rock by injecting fluids (water, chemicals, proppant) at high pressure into horizontal wells. After a well is fracked, the recovered fluid must be disposed of. Currently, the majority of fracturing companies use <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> <b>systems.</b> The fluid is put into an evaporation pit with the intent of evaporating as much as possible before it is hauled away for processing.
