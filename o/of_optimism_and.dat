5|$|After the {{six years}} of absolutism that {{followed}} Ferdinand's return to the throne on 1 January 1820, Rafael del Riego initiated an army revolt {{with the intent of}} restoring the 1812 Constitution. By March, the king was forced to agree, but by September 1823, after an unstable period, a French invasion supported by an alliance of the major powers had removed the constitutional government. The last prints were probably not completed until after the Constitution was restored, though certainly before Goya left Spain in May 1824.

25|$|In {{order to}} {{continue}} researching and analyzing folklore, intellectuals needed to justify its worth to the Communist regime. Otherwise, collections of folklore, along with all other literature deemed useless {{for the purposes of}} Stalin's Five Year Plan, would be an unacceptable realm of study. In 1934, Maksim Gorky gave a speech to the Union of Soviet Writers arguing that folklore could, in fact, be consciously used to promote Communist values. Apart from expounding on the artistic value of folklore, he stressed that traditional legends and fairy tales showed ideal, community-oriented characters, which exemplified the model Soviet citizen. Folklore, with many of its conflicts based on the struggles of a labor-oriented lifestyle, was relevant to Communism as it could not have existed without the direct contribution of the working classes. Also, Gorky explained that folklore characters expressed high levels <b>of</b> <b>optimism,</b> <b>and</b> therefore could encourage readers to maintain a positive mindset, especially as their lives changed with the further development of Communism.|$|E
25|$|A {{day before}} the trade deadline, the Mavericks instigated a deal. The trade sent Josh Howard, James Singleton, and Drew Gooden to the Washington Wizards in {{exchange}} for Caron Butler, Brendan Haywood, and Deshawn Stevenson. The Mavericks felt that this trade was necessary due to Howard's declining performance and apparent unhappiness with the Mavericks organization. Some NBA analysts {{felt that this was}} a good move, because not only did it remove a disgruntled Howard from the line-up, it simultaneously brought Dirk Nowitzki a quality supporting cast, with many believing that the Mavs could contend for a title after the trade went through. The trade clearly worked, because the new-look Mavericks came out of the all-star break with a vengeance. On January 24, 2010, the Dallas Mavericks routed The New York Knicks 128–78. This was the third largest margin of victory in NBA history. The previous largest margin of victory for the Mavericks was 45 points. After dropping the second-half opener to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks went on to win 13-straight games before losing to the New York Knicks. On April 10, the Mavericks clinched the Southwest division after defeating the Portland Trail Blazers 83–77. The Mavericks finished the season with a 55–27 record, good enough for the second seed in the Western Conference. The Mavericks then entered the post-season with quite a bit <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> an assurance that they could seriously contend for a title.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{validity}} of previous findings, some researchers still question whether EI – job performance correlation makes a real impact on business strategies. They argue that popularity of emotional intelligence’s studies is due to media advertising, rather than objective scientific findings. Also, it is mentioned that relationship between job performance and EI is {{not as strong as}} suggested. This relationship requires the presence of other constructs to rise important outcomes. For instance, previous studies found that EI is positively associated with teamwork effectiveness under job contexts of high managerial work demands, which improves job performance. This is due to activation of strong emotions during performance on this job context. In this scenario, emotional intelligent individuals show a better set of resources to succeed on their roles. However, individuals with high EI show a similar level of performance than non-emotional intelligent employees under different job contexts. Moreover, Joseph and Newman (2010) suggested that emotional perception and emotional regulation components of EI highly contribute to job performance under job contexts of high emotional demands. Moon and Hur (2011) found that emotional exhaustion (“burn-out”) significantly influences the job performance – EI relationship. Emotional exhaustion showed a negative association with two components of EI (optimism and social skills). This association impacted negatively to job performance, as well. Hence, job performance – EI relationship is stronger under contexts of high emotional exhaustion or burn-out; in other words, employees with high levels <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> social skills possess better resources to outperform when facing high emotional exhaustion contexts.|$|E

Framing effect has been widely studied in various health contexts and {{it has been shown that}} gain-framed messages are more effective than loss-framed messages to promote preventive behaviors. However, a subsequent systematic review has found that framing effect can be moderated by different dispositional factors. On the other hand, dispositional optimism has also been studied in various health contexts and found to be associated with better physical and psychological outcomes. The selective information processing enables optimists to pick up the most relevant and important information, suggested that self-relevance leads to better information processing on health messages. To study how to promote vegetable consumption and to investigate the underlying mechanism between <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> health outcomes, the current study explored the effect <b>of</b> <b>Optimism,</b> Self-relevance <b>and</b> Message Framing, as well as the interaction of the levels <b>of</b> <b>optimism,</b> self-relevance <b>and</b> message framing.

2500|$|Klee was at {{the peak}} of his {{creative}} output. His Ad Parnassum (1932) is considered his masterpiece and the best example of his pointillist style; it is also one of his largest, most finely worked paintings. He produced nearly 500 works in 1933 during his last year in Germany. However, in 1933, Klee began experiencing the symptoms of what was diagnosed as scleroderma after his death. The progression of his fatal disease, which made swallowing very difficult, can be followed through the art he created in his last years. His output in 1936 was only 25 pictures. In the later 1930s, his health recovered somewhat and he was encouraged by a visit from Kandinsky and Picasso. Klee's simpler and larger designs enabled him to keep up his output in his final years, and in 1939 he created over 1,200 works, a career high for one year. He used heavier lines and mainly geometric forms with fewer but larger blocks of color. His varied color palettes, some with bright colors and others sober, perhaps reflected his alternating moods <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> <b>and</b> pessimism. Back in Germany in 1937, seventeen of Klee's pictures were included in an exhibition of [...] "Degenerate art" [...] and 102 of his works in public collections were seized by the Nazis.|$|E
