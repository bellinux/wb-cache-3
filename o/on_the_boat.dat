5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) Skypes {{into the}} office from his boat. He is {{severely}} sunburned, loses his supply of fresh water in the ocean, and is going mad from lack of human contact despite only been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> for two days.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of a lack}} {{of space}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> <b>the</b> crews do not have an audio mixer. Audio is {{recorded}} using wireless microphones worn by the fishermen and shotgun microphones attached to the cameras. In audio post production, the sound team attempts to use actual sounds that were recorded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|R

5|$|Compressor diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Evans-Jones as Wallace Hartley: The ship's bandmaster and violinist {{who plays}} {{uplifting}} music with his colleagues <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> deck {{as the ship}} sinks. As the final plunge begins, he leads the band in a final performance of Nearer, My God, to Thee, {{to the tune of}} Bethany, and dies in the sinking.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall {{from the}} storm reached over 7inches (175mm) a short {{distance}} east of Pensacola, Florida, though impact in the state was minor. Wind gusts peaked at 38mph (61km/h) in Pensacola. In Alabama, Beryl produced sustained winds of 38mph (61km/h), with gusts to 54mph (86km/h), as well as above normal tides. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in coastal portions of Alabama, peaking at 16.09inches (408mm) on Dauphin Island. Rough waves overturned a shrimp boat in Mobile Bay. A 15-year-old boy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> drowned, the only direct fatality {{from the storm}}. The boy's father, also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> spent 24hours in the water before being rescued by the United States Coast Guard. The waves caused severe beach erosion along the coastline, with Dauphin Island losing 60 to 70feet (18 to 21m) of beach.|$|E

5|$|Brunt {{joined the}} British Army {{when he left}} school, {{training}} as a private soldier with the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment in 1941, during the Second World War. He received a commission as a second lieutenant on 2 January 1943, and was posted to North Africa. Although he was commissioned in the Sherwood Foresters, he never served with them, instead being posted to the 6th Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment (6th Lincolns), a Territorial Army (TA) unit, having become friendly with Captain Alan Money, {{an officer in the}} Lincolns, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> to North Africa. The battalion was part of the 138th Infantry Brigade of the 46th Infantry Division. The division was then commanded by Major General John Hawkesworth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ending}} {{that was in}} the {{original}} theatrical version, Ellen rammed the shark with Mike's boat, mortally wounding it. The shark then causes the boat to break apart with its death contortions, forcing the people <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> to jump off to avoid going down with it. American audiences disapproved of this ending. A new ending was ordered shot for foreign distribution with the shark getting stabbed with the bow sprit and then exploding; and with Jake being found wounded but alive. This version is what Universal used on home media releases.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, a {{schooner}} carrying {{four people}} capsized in rough seas roughly 250mi (400km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on June30. The four crew were {{a father and}} his three kids. A diabetic, the 30-year-old father searched for his insulin pen in the capsized ship; however, for the fifteen days they were stranded, {{he was unable to}} find it. During the event, he slipped into a coma and later died on July4, leaving his kids <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> On July14, the three kids were rescued by the Ellinora, a Greek merchant ship.|$|E

5000|$|The Danes were ready, {{and fired}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> as they approached. The British {{immediately}} boarded {{and carried the}} first vessel but the other three resisted longer.|$|R
60|$|The way being thus opened, Timur Melek {{very soon}} {{afterward}} embarked {{his family and}} {{the greater part of}} his army <b>on</b> board <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> in <b>the</b> night; and, while the Monguls had no suspicion of what was going <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> were launched, and sent off one after another swiftly down the stream. Before morning came all traces of the party had passed away.|$|R
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> Mulder and Smith {{debate whether}} they should save Mulder’s mother Teena, despite the risk of Men in Black {{awaiting}} them. Mulder ultimately agrees {{that it would be}} too dangerous to visit her. Instead, they head towards Canada, where Smith says Mulder will find his sister, Samantha. Meanwhile, the First Elder (Don S. Williams) meets with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) in Teena's hospital room, confronting him with photos of his prior meeting with her, taken by X (Steven Williams). They realize that there is a leak, and plan to smoke out its source by releasing false information about Teena being in danger.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> Susan dives {{underwater}} and {{encounters a}} tiger shark. Taking shelter behind a reef, she is attacked by an underwater zombie. She escapes as the shark and the zombie attack each other. Brian shoots at the shark, and the shark rams the boat, damaging it. Eventually, the group arrives at Matul, firing distress flares to request assistance. Menard goes to meet them, leaving his nurse (Stefania D'Amario) {{to supervise the}} mass burial of dead patients. He tells Anne that her father is dead—a victim of the troubles on the island—and asks the group to check on Paola. They are horrified to discover her corpse being devoured by zombies.|$|E
5|$|The fire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> deck {{penetrated}} to a magazine. Evidence {{given to}} the second board indicated that the doors for the 4-inch ammunition supply trunks were closed throughout the action. It remains possible that a door or trunk could have been opened up by an enemy shell, admitting flames to the magazine. Alternative routes for admission of flame {{could have been the}} ventilation or venting arrangements of the magazines or, as Ted Briggs suggested, through the floor of a 15-inch gunhouse.|$|E
60|$|But {{she hesitated}} still, and with arrow {{drawn to the}} head, faced first <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat's</b> crew, and then <b>on</b> Amyas, till <b>the</b> Englishmen had shoved off full twenty yards.|$|R
60|$|Where was the Mowree? His brown {{hand was}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat's</b> gunwale; {{and he was}} hauled aboard in the very midst of the mad bubbles that burst under the bows.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is also a}} {{residential}} centre, and [...] "The Ark", a floating pontoon base on Barton Broad. Visitors can fish during the season, and many enjoy bird watching whilst <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{rainfall}} {{resulted in}} severe flooding on Martinique, which accrued to almost 10feet (3m) in some locations; two sisters drowned near Saint-Joseph after a bridge was washed away. Several landslides were {{reported on the}} island. The passage of the cyclone left damaged and power and telephone systems. 750people evacuated their homes in Le Lamentin due to flooding, {{and a total of}} 1,500residents were left homeless on the island. Offshore, rough conditions damaged a fishing vessel, leaving its two passengers drifting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> for 25days before being rescued about 640miles (1035km) to the north-northwest of Martinique. In all, seven people were killed on the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{destroyed}} by the explosion of her own torpedoes. According to Goodall's theory, the ship's torpedoes could have been detonated either by the fire raging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> deck or, more probably, by a direct hit from Bismarck. This would have blown out {{the side of the}} ship, destroying the girder strength of the hull; the force of water entering the hole, at a speed of nearly , would then shear the stern section {{from the rest of the}} hull.|$|E
5|$|This {{section was}} named after a song by The Smiths. The motorboat driven by David Beckham arrived with the Olympic Flame via the Limehouse Cut and the Lee Navigation. Steve Redgrave lit his torch from that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> and carried it into the stadium through an honour guard of 500 of the {{construction}} workers who had built the Olympic Park. He passed the flame on to a team of seven young people, each nominated by a famous British Olympian to convey the Games' aim to 'inspire a generation'. Six of the team were athletes, and the seventh was a volunteer young ambassador.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Qintong <b>Boat</b> Festival is {{held every}} year in Qingming, around April 4-6. During <b>the</b> festival, <b>boats</b> from nearby villages and towns {{converge}} on Xique lake {{for a few days}} of celebration. Theatrical performances, dragon and lion dances, and other folk dances are held <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|R
60|$|At half-past six {{the townspeople}} began to gather. All were armed with muskets or rifles, pikes or swords, and quietly and without {{confusion}} {{they took their}} allotted places, some <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> some <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two ships.|$|R
5000|$|American Exceptionalism: Winthrop {{explains}} how God chose <b>the</b> few people <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> {{to go to}} America in order {{to carry out their}} mission. He also mentions how {{the rest of the world}} will watch them.|$|R
5|$|With {{the ship}} sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> deck, Cal and Jack {{encourage}} her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.|$|E
5|$|Kikai {{thought that}} {{work on a}} boat might be photogenic, but, having no experience, {{could not get a}} job on one. He was {{eventually}} accepted on a boat fishing for tuna when he displayed the scar from an unneeded appendectomy as evidence of one risk fewer that his presence might force the boat into port. He worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> in the Pacific from 6 April until 9 November 1972, with a stop in Manzanillo (Mexico) for provisions. It was during this time that he took his first photographs to be published, in the May 1973 issue of Camera Mainichi. In 1973 he won a prize for his submission to the 14th exhibition of the Japan Advertising Photographers’ Association. But Kikai decided that in order to be a photographer he needed darkroom skills, and he returned to Tokyo to work at Doi Technical Photo (1973–76). He became a freelance photographer in 1984, a year after his first solo exhibition and the same year as his second.|$|E
5|$|Most of Roxas, {{population}} 100,000, was underwater {{due to the}} storm. Around 80% {{of houses}} there were damaged, 40–50% homes were destroyed, and 100people were killed. Throughout the surrounding Capiz province, 265people were killed and many towns were underwater. In that province and Illoilo, damage totaled $40million, with property damage in just Capiz amounting to $25million. Throughout Panay Island, 448fatalities were reported and at least eight people were injured. Island-wide, the storm destroyed five bridges and thirty-five schools. It also wrecked dozens of fishing boats, and uprooted trees. There, 4,014homes were demolished, resulting in more than 24,000individuals losing their homes. Elsewhere, 41people were killed in Leyte Island and Samar Island. In the former, two ships capsized that resulted in two drownings and property damage totaled $40million. In the Antique province, authorities reported five deaths. In the Romblon province, five casualties occurred. On Cebu Island, six people died. Within {{the vicinity of the}} island nation, 38children died aboard a ferry boat after it sunk, though the adults <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> swam to safety.|$|E
