5|$|The Senate was the {{predominant}} political {{institution in the}} Roman Republic. The Senate's authority derived primarily from custom and tradition. It {{was also one of}} the few places in which free political discussion could take place. The Senate's principal role was as an advisory council to the consuls <b>on</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> foreign and military policy, and it exercised a great deal of influence over consular decision-making.|$|E
5|$|Through its Science Policy Centre, the Society {{acts as an}} {{advisor to}} the European Commission and the United Nations <b>on</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> science.

5|$|While Radford {{remained}} Eisenhower's {{principal adviser}} for the budget, they differed <b>on</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> foreign policy. Radford advocated {{the use of}} nuclear weapons and a firm military and diplomatic stance against China. Early in his tenure, he suggested to Eisenhower a preventive war against China or the Soviet Union while the U.S. possessed a nuclear advantage and before it became entangled in conflicts in the Far East. Eisenhower immediately dismissed this idea.|$|E

5|$|Established by Standing Order 18 of the Senate, the {{privileges}} committee {{is responsible for}} reporting <b>on</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> parliamentary privilege referred to it by the Senate. The protections afforded by parliamentary privilege are essential to parliament and its committees {{to be able to}} operate effectively. The bulk of the work of {{the privileges}} committee's work is associated with facilitating a 'right of reply' for people adversely named in the Senate, as well as involving investigations of unauthorised disclosures of Senate committee proceedings, complaints from witnesses in connection with evidence given to committees, and allegedly misleading evidence given to committees.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June {{the royal}} {{government}} and the remaining rebels, who were unsatisfied with the charters granted the previous day, agreed to meet at Smithfield, just outside the city walls. London remained in confusion, with various bands of rebels roaming the city independently. Richard prayed at Westminster Abbey, before setting out for the meeting in the late afternoon. The chronicler accounts of the encounter all vary <b>on</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> detail, but agree on the broad sequence of events. The King and his party, at least 200 strong and including men-at-arms, positioned themselves outside St Bartholomew's Priory {{to the east of}} Smithfield, and the thousands of rebels massed along the western end.|$|E

5|$|Since the Romans used a form {{of direct}} democracy, citizens, and not elected representatives, voted before each {{assembly}}. As such, the citizen-electors had no power, other than to cast a vote. Each assembly was presided over by a single Roman Magistrate, and as such, it was the presiding magistrate who made all decisions <b>on</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> procedure and legality. Ultimately, the presiding magistrate's power over the assembly was nearly absolute. The only check on that power {{came in the form}} of vetoes handed down by other magistrates.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment protects public {{employees}} from retaliation by their employer when speaking <b>on</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> public concern. In Pickering v. Board of Education (1968), the Court first articulated {{the right of}} {{public employees}} {{to be protected from}} dismissal for exercising their right to free speech. There, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a teacher who was fired after writing a letter to a local newspaper critical of its handling of a recent bond issue. Eight years later, this protection from dismissal was extended to cover partisan political ideology and affiliation in Elrod v. Burns.|$|E
5|$|The State President of the South African Republic, Paul Kruger, {{was not an}} easy man to work with, and in {{some circles}} it was {{predicted}} that Reitz would quickly find himself subordinated to Kruger. This was not the case, however. On occasion the two men clashed <b>on</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> policy, but Reitz remained true to his own convictions, gaining some influence over Kruger in the process. Originally praised by the British for his diplomatic courtesy, their attitude quickly changed when they understood that Reitz was a protagonist of Transvaal independence. Reitz was sometimes rather brazen in his political statements, so when he – incorrectly – claimed the South African Republic to be a fully sovereign state, the British jumped on him.|$|E

5|$|The {{privileges}} {{have been}} lost and eroded over time.

The right to be tried by other peers was abolished in 1948. Legal opinion considers the right of freedom from arrest as extremely limited in application, if at all. The remaining privilege is not exercised and was recommended for formal abolition in 1999, but has never been formally revoked.|$|E

5|$|We {{know more}} about Lancaster's {{character}} than of most of his contemporaries through his memoirs, the Livre de seyntz medicines (Book of the Holy Doctors). This book is a highly personal treatise <b>on</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> religion and piety, but it also contains details of historical interest. It, among other things, revealed that Lancaster, {{at the age of}} 44 when he wrote the book in 1354, suffered from gout. The book is primarily a devotional work though; it is organised around seven wounds which Henry claims to have, representing the seven sins. Lancaster confesses to his sins, explains various real and mythical medical remedies in terms of their theological symbolism, and exhorts the reader to greater morality.|$|E
