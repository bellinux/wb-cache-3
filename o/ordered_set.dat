5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially <b>ordered</b> <b>set.</b> One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E
25|$|While {{chain is}} {{sometimes}} merely {{a synonym for}} totally <b>ordered</b> <b>set,</b> it can also refer to a totally ordered subset of some partially <b>ordered</b> <b>set.</b> The latter definition has {{a crucial role in}} Zorn's lemma.|$|E

40|$|Most {{computerized}} physician {{order entry}} (CPOE) systems have built-in support for <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> (collections of <b>orders</b> grouped by a clinical purpose). Evidence and experience suggest that <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> are important tools for ordering efficiency and decision support and may influence ordering. Developing and maintaining <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> is costly, so hospitals often must prioritize which <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> can be created. We analyzed <b>order</b> <b>set</b> utilization at seven diverse sites with CPOE. The number of <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> per site ranged from 81 to 535, {{and the number}} of <b>order</b> <b>set</b> uses per discharge ranged from 0. 48 to 9. 89. We also compared the top ten <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> at each site, and found many commonalities, such as generic and condition-specific admission <b>order</b> <b>sets,</b> surgical sets and clinical pathways. We also found that, at each site, utilization of <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> was skewed, with a small number of <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> comprising the bulk of utilization. These findings may be useful for <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> developers, particularly in settings where resources are constrained and the most important <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> must be developed first...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the extent of change in patient care orders primarily for six diagnoses, procedures, or conditions in a not-for-profit Midwestern rural referral hospital. A descriptive method was used to analyze changes in the <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> over time for chest pain with acute myocardial infarction, degenerative osteoarthritis with hip joint replacement and degenerative osteoarthritis with knee joint replacement procedures, coronary artery bypass graft procedures, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia. Ten items about service-specific <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> were abstracted during pre- and post-EHR implementation and a year later. We then examined use 5 years later. The findings illustrate how the <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> evolved with multiple nested <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> to facilitate computerized provider order entry with a rate greater than 70 % by physicians. The total number of available patient care orders within the <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> increased primarily because of linked nested <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> related to medications and diagnostic tests.

40|$|AbstractThe {{theory of}} <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> {{lies at the}} {{confluence}} of several branches of mathematics including set theory, lattice theory, combinatorial theory, and even aspects of modern operations research. While <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> are often peripheral to the mainstream {{of any of these}} theories there arise, from time to time, problems which are order-theoretic in substance. The aim of this work is to fashion a classification scheme for <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> which aimed at providing a unified vantage point for some of the problems encountered with <b>ordered</b> <b>sets.</b> This classification scheme is based on a structure theory much akin to the familiar subdirect representation theory so useful in general algebra. The novelry of the structure theory lies in the importance that we attach to, and the widespread use that we make of, the concept of retract. At present, some vindication for our classification scheme can be found by examining its effectiveness for totally <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> (e. g., well-ordered sets, the rationals, reals, etc.) as well as for those finite <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> that arise commonly in combinatorial investigations (e. g., crowns and fences) ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Computerized {{physician}} {{order entry}} (CPOE) systems are quickly becoming ubiquitous, {{and groups of}} orders ("order sets") to allow for easy order input are a common feature. This provides a streamlined mechanism to view, modify, and place groups of related orders. This often serves as an electronic equivalent of a specialty requisition. A characteristic, of these <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> is that specific orders can be predetermined to be "preselected" or "defaulted-on" whenever the <b>order</b> <b>set</b> is used while others are "optional" or "defaulted-off" (though there is typically the option is to "deselect" defaulted-on tests in a given situation). While it seems intuitive that the defaults in an <b>order</b> <b>set</b> are often accepted, additional study is required to understand {{the impact of these}} "default" settings in an <b>order</b> <b>set</b> on <b>ordering</b> habits. This study set out to quantify the effect of changing the default settings of an <b>order</b> <b>set.</b> Methods: For quality improvement purposes, <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> dealing with transfusions were recently reviewed and modified to improve monitoring of outcome. Initially, the order for posttransfusion hematocrits and platelet count had the default setting changed from "optional" to "preselected. " The default settings for platelet count was later changed back to "optional," allowing for a natural experiment to study the effect of the default selections of an <b>order</b> <b>set</b> on clinician <b>ordering</b> habits. Results: Posttransfusion hematocrit values were ordered for 8. 3 % of red cell transfusions when the default <b>order</b> <b>set</b> selection was "off" and for 57. 4 % of transfusions when the default selection was "preselected" (P < 0. 0001). Posttransfusion platelet counts were ordered for 7. 0 % of platelet transfusions when the initial default <b>order</b> <b>set</b> selection was "optional," increased to 59. 4 % when the default was changed to "preselected" (P < 0. 0001), and then decreased to 7. 5 % when the default selection was returned to "optional. " The posttransfusion platelet count rates during the two "optional" periods: 7. 0 % versus 7. 5 % - were not statistically different (P = 0. 620). Discussion: Default settings in CPOE <b>order</b> <b>sets</b> can significantly influence physician selection of laboratory tests. Careful consideration by all stakeholders, including clinicians and pathologists, should be obtained when establishing default settings in <b>order</b> <b>sets...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim was {{to assess}} a {{standardized}} <b>order</b> <b>set</b> for perioperative pain management in highly opioid-tolerant patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery. Methods: This retrospective chart review evaluated a pain <b>order</b> <b>set</b> in highly opioid-tolerant patients undergoing elective total knee or total hip arthroplasty from January 2010 through August 2012. Based on {{the date of the}} surgery, patients were allocated into preimplementation or postimplementation <b>order</b> <b>set</b> groups. The primary outcome assessed whether an adjustment in daily opioid dosage was required within the first 48 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included pain scores, length of hospitalization, and safety outcomes. Results: Sixty patients were included in the analysis. An adjustment to postoperative opioid therapy occurred in 62 % of the patients in the preimplementation group and in 56 % of postimplementation group patients (P = 0. 786). There were no differences in median pain scores 48 hours postoperatively (P = 0. 348). Cumulative toxicity was increased after <b>order</b> <b>set</b> implementation compared with previous patients (44 % versus 5 %, P < 0. 005); however, opioid doses held for sedation was the only individual toxicity to reach statistical significance (P = 0. 011).
