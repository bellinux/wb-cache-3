5|$|During the event, a Warlord infiltrates Camelot and poisons Squire Everett. The party {{collects}} {{an antidote}} in the Swamp of Zagar and saves the Squire. They then claim the fourth Key <b>of</b> <b>Truth</b> <b>in</b> Stone Keep. They rescue {{the son of}} the Gnome King to obtain the fifth Key of Truth, and collects four Elemental Keys to unlock access to Castle Vilor and the sixth Key of Truth. The party finds the seventh and eighth Keys <b>of</b> <b>Truth</b> <b>in</b> Crownhorn village and the Cape of Death, respectively. The ninth and tenth Keys are found in Blackroot Keep and the Dark Citadel while searching for the missing pieces of the Staff of Rhiothamus, which can break open a path in Hadrian's Wall.|$|E
5|$|The party {{retrieves}} the Excalibur sword {{from the}} Lady of the Lake, proving their worth by claiming the Pendragon Shield {{from a young}} dragon at Shield Heights.

They {{make their way into}} the village of Welton, which is under a mind control spell, and recover the second Key of Truth at Gruesome Keep. After breaking the spell on Welton and crossing the Blinder's Way, they claim the third Key of Truth at Castle Sanguine.|$|E

5|$|Several {{different}} {{estimates for the}} size of the Persian fleet are given. Thucydides says that there was a fleet of 200 Phoenician ships, and is generally considered the most reliable source. Plutarch gives numbers of 350 from Ephorus and 600 from Phanodemus. Furthermore, Plutarch says that the Persian fleet was awaiting 80 Phoenician ships sailing from Cyprus. Although Thucydides's account is generally to be favoured, there may an element <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> Plutarch's assertion that the Persians were awaiting further reinforcements; this would explain why Cimon was able to launch a pre-emptive assault on them. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for {{the size of the}} Persian land army. However, the number of Persian marines accompanying the fleet was presumably in the same range as the number of Greek marines (c. 5,000), since the Persian ships carried the same complement of troops. Plutarch quotes Ephorus as saying that Tithraustes was commander of the royal fleet, and Pherendatis of the infantry, but says that Callisthenes named Ariomandes as overall commander.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the main}} {{building}} contains the University of London's Central Academic Bodies and activities, including {{the offices of the}} Vice-Chancellor of the University, the entire collection of the Senate House Library, and seven of the nine research institutes of the School of Advanced Study. During the Second World War, the building's use by the Ministry of Information inspired two noted English writers. Graham Greene's novel The Ministry of Fear (1943) and its film adaptation Ministry of Fear by Fritz Lang (1944) set in Bloomsbury. George Orwell's wife Eileen worked in Senate House for the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information, and her experiences inspired the description of the Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Truth</b> <b>in</b> Orwell's 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.|$|E
5|$|Using the Staff, {{the party}} goes past Hadrian's Wall {{and into the}} Dark Forest, where the {{eleventh}} Key of Truth is found. In a cemetery, they stumble upon a statue of Morgana, which fires a magic beam that kills the two Knights in the party. Arthur travels to the Town of the Dead by himself then to the Plain of the Dead and retrieves his two dead Knights. They reach Morgana's castle, Stone Gardens, and defeat Morgana in her dragon form, thus obtaining the last Key <b>of</b> <b>Truth.</b> <b>In</b> the game's ending sequence, the party members are congratulated by the real, freed King Arthur, and Merlin uses Stonehenge to send {{them back to their}} era.|$|E

5|$|We {{shall not}} feel that the generalization, {{unqualified}} and to be taken literally, is meant to march out of its context {{to compete with the}} scientific and philosophical generalizations which dominate our world. 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty' has precisely the same status, and the same justification as Shakespeare's 'Ripeness is all.' It is a speech 'in character' and supported by a dramatic context. To conclude thus may seem to weight the principle of dramatic propriety with more than it can bear. This would not be fair to the complexity of the problem <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> art nor fair to Keats's little parable. Granted; and yet the principle of dramatic propriety may take us further than would first appear. Respect for it may at least insure our dealing with the problem of truth at the level on which it is really relevant to literature.|$|E
5|$|Isis was {{originally}} a goddess in ancient Egyptian religion, {{which did not}} include Greek-style mysteries. Some Egyptian rituals were performed exclusively by priests, out of public view, but ordinary Egyptians were never permitted to join in. Other rituals may have reenacted events from Egyptian mythology, such as the ceremonies in honor of Osiris, {{the god of the}} afterlife and the mythological husband of Isis, that were performed at Abydos. The Greeks interpreted these myth-based rituals as mysteries. The historian Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BCE, was the first to do so. He referred to Egyptian rites reenacting the myth of the murder of Osiris as mysteries, likening them to the mysteries of Dionysus he was familiar with in Greece. He further said that the Greek worship of Dionysus was influenced by the worship of Osiris in Egypt. Various Greek writers who came after Herodotus viewed Egypt and its priests as the source of all mystical wisdom. They claimed that many elements of Greek philosophy and culture came from Egypt, including the mystery cults. Burkert and the Egyptologist Francesco Tiradritti both say there is a grain <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> these claims, as the oldest Greek mystery cults developed in the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, {{at the same time that}} Greece was developing closer contacts with Egyptian culture. The imagery of the afterlife found in the mystery cults may thus have been influenced by that in Egyptian afterlife beliefs.|$|E

While Jesus gave “an objective standard of truth: himself,” Hubbard said “Know thyself and the truth shall set you free,” expressing the subjectivity and existentiality <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> Scientology, compared to the centrality of Jesus in the pursuit <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> Christianity.|$|E

25|$|Whilst the {{accounts}} of first two Sangams are generally rejected as ahistorical, some modern scholars, such as Kamil Zvelebil, find a kernel <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> them, suggesting {{that they may be}} based on one or more actual historical assemblies.

25|$|Other {{philosophers}} {{take this}} common meaning to be secondary and derivative.

On this view, the conception of truth as correctness is a later derivation from the concept's original essence, a development Heidegger traces to the Latin term veritas.|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> {{an interpretation}} {{that uses a}} variable assignment function cannot work with empty domains, {{because there are no}} variable assignment functions whose range is empty. (Similarly, one cannot assign interpretations to constant symbols.) This truth definition requires that one must select a variable assignment function (μ above) before truth values for even atomic formulas can be defined. Then the truth value of a sentence is defined to be its truth value under any variable assignment, and it is proved that this truth value does not depend on which assignment is chosen. This technique does not work if there are no assignment functions at all; it must be changed to accommodate empty domains.|$|E
25|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} lack of {{progress}} in Filipinizing the Church, as well as the dominance of American missionaries and their attitude of racial discrimination, Church members at Tondo, Manila established Ang Kapisanang Katotohanan (The Society <b>of</b> <b>Truth)</b> <b>in</b> 1904. Their primary purpose was to accelerate the pace of evangelism and initiate methods that would make Filipino evangelists be at par with their American counterparts. Due to the threat of secession, the American missionaries had to counter the momentum of the society. Thus, they transferred Zamora to the Tondo church in 1906. Zamora's efforts to keep the church together was successful, for by 1907, the society was disbanded. Actually, the Tondo church even grew. From 500 members in 1906, there were 588 members in 1907.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} claim, {{that while}} acceptance of Jordanes {{at face value}} may be too naive, a totally skeptical view is not warranted. For example, Jordanes says that the Goths originated in Scandinavia 1490 BC. Austrian historian Herwig Wolfram, believes {{that there might be}} a kernel <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> that claim, if we assume that a clan of the Gutae left Scandinavia long before the establishment of the Amali in the leadership of the Goths. This clan might have contributed to the ethnogenesis of the Gutones in east Pomerania (see Wielbark culture). Another example is the name of the king Cniva which David S. Potter thinks is genuine because, since it doesn't appear in the fictionalized genealogy of Gothic kings given by Jordanes, he must have found it in a genuine 3rd-century source.|$|E
