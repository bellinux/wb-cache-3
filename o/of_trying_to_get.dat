5|$|On 7 June 2010, Van der Sloot {{reportedly}} {{confessed to}} killing Flores, {{after hours of}} interrogation. He initially proclaimed his innocence. According to an expert in Peruvian law, the confession fit a defense strategy <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the charge reduced to manslaughter, which is punishable by 6 to 20 years in prison, while a conviction for murder could result in up to 35 years' imprisonment. The prosecution was seeking a sentence of 30 years. Peru does not issue life sentences in standard cases of murder and has abolished capital punishment in all but exceptional circumstances, such as crimes committed under military law. A life sentence can be issued for a murder committed during the commission of a robbery. Peruvian president Alan García Pérez used the case to seek the reinstatement {{of the death penalty}} for murder.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Herren {{signed to}} the British label Warp under two aliases, Prefuse 73 and Savath & Savalas, after Warp staff {{had heard a}} {{previous}} record of Herren's which had sparked their interest in his work. Herren {{was familiar with the}} label through artists Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada, but chose to sign to Warp as he was a fan of the group Broadcast who had released an EP through the label. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives features rapping from Mikah 9, Aesop Rock and MF Doom, and vocals from Sam Prekop of the indie rock band the Sea and Cake. The vocalists did not work directly with Herren, but sent him audio tapes of their own vocal recordings. Herren later commented on having Prekop sing on the album, noting that having an indie rock artist on the album was his way <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his sound out to a new audience.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland next faced San Francisco at home, winning 37–14 {{before one}} of the biggest crowds of the season. Chet Adams opened the scoring for the Browns with a 44-yard field goal; he and Lou Saban shared kicking duties in the game after Groza pulled his leg muscle during pre-game warmups. On the ensuing possession, Albert had the ball {{stripped}} by Cleveland's Weldon Humble, and the Browns took over and scored their first touchdown on a Graham pass to Lavelli. San Francisco scored a touchdown near the beginning of the second quarter, but Cleveland dominated the scoring thereafter. Lavelli caught seven passes for a total of three touchdowns, setting an AAFC single-game record. Graham also rushed for a one-yard touchdown and threw for 222 yards. His touchdown passes made him the league leader in that category, with 18 on the season. It was the biggest margin of victory the Browns had ever recorded against the 49ers. Cleveland was helped by an adjustment Paul Brown made in his receivers' routes; the coach had Lavelli and Speedie run toward {{the middle of the field}} instead <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> open near the sidelines, as they had done in past games. The victory clinched the AAFC's western division for the Browns and assured the team a spot in the championship game.|$|E

Sirkis was particularly interested in using the 1MHz PIC microcontroller, which were available for only US$1 a piece. After six months <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the modem working with the PIC, Heatherington gave up and demanded they use the 8MHz Zilog Z8 instead, a US$10 part. Sirkis acquiesced, and a working prototype was soon complete.|$|E

25|$|I will {{no longer}} {{participate}} in this transparent ploy to gather media attention for Finkelstein and his publisher.

Finkelstein's deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and Palestinians are trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books.

25|$|May {{enjoyed a}} largely {{successful}} captaincy of both his county and country. Surrey had been County Champions {{for seven years}} running, with May the captain {{for the last two}} seasons, and until 1958 England was never defeated under his leadership. He had beaten South Africa 3–2 in 1955, considered by many to have been the most exciting Test series since the war, Australia 2–1 in 1956, the West Indies 3–0 in 1957 and New Zealand 4–0 in 1958. He was widely regarded as the best post-war batsman England produced, tall, strong and disciplined with a near-perfect technique, a straight bat and a complete range of strokes. His standards improved with the responsibilities of captaincy and his Test average as captain was 54.03. His highest score was at Edgbaston in 1957 when England trailed West Indies by 288 runs in the first innings; he made 285 not out, the highest score by an England captain until Graham Gooch's 333 in 1990, adding 411 with Colin Cowdrey (154) – still an England record for any wicket – and destroyed the mesmerising hold the spinner Sonny Ramadhin had over English batsmen. In the low scoring Ashes series of 1956 he had made 453 runs (90.60) and was out only once for less than 50, when he made 43. Although himself a highly educated amateur and a gentleman he realised that the old class divisions in English cricket were breaking down and under Len Hutton's leadership the amateur and professional had merged. He enjoyed the complete loyalty of the team and the selectors and was ready to help his players and smooth down feathers. As a captain he was a strict team disciplinarian who expected high standards, he was ruthless when the occasion demanded, but could be inflexible and unimaginative and lacked the charisma of a natural leader. In 1958–59 he played too defensively and surrendered the initiative too readily to Richie Benaud and he concentrated on saving runs instead <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> batsmen out. Faced with Ian Meckiff's questionable bowling in the disastrous First Test he declined to make an official complaint as it would appear unsporting. After the Australian tour May beat New Zealand 1–0, India 5–0 and led England to its first series victory in the West Indies 1–0. He lost 2–1 to the 1961 Australians and retired due to ill-health having been captain in a then record 41 Tests (20 wins, 10 defeats and 11 draws), Benaud being the only man to defeat him in a Test series. He retired entirely from first-class cricket in 1963, taking up a post in the City. with the insurance brokerage Willis Faber Dumas -now Willis Group.|$|E

In the original script, Claire was [...] "happily married", but Curry chose to have her separated due to her husband's infidelity, {{so that she could}} be a [...] "more sympathetic character". Curry was influenced by the real-life story of Mary Kay Letourneau, a teacher who became involved with her underage student, causing her to be convicted for rape charges. Director Rob Cohen revealed that in Curry's draft, the character of Noah was younger, but he made the conscious decision to age him to 19, because he felt as if it was [...] "not healthy" [...] and that audiences would lose sympathy for the protagonist. Explaining her character, Lopez stated that Claire was feeling [...] "worthless" [...] after her husband cheated, and [...] "People can understand that.

500|$|The {{feeling of}} urgency spread {{throughout}} Greenwich Village, even {{to people who}} had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing {{an opportunity to take}} action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, called the Annual Reminder. Organizers Craig Rodwell, Frank Kameny, Randy Wicker, Barbara Gittings, and Kay Lahusen, who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines. This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, [...] "None of that! None of that!" [...] Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches. Participant Lilli Vincenz remembered, [...] "It was clear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered." [...] Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> attention. One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.|$|E
