5|$|Written by Peter Grimwade, this two-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 13 August 1984 and abandoned due to budgetary concerns on 8 November 1984 {{after the completion}} of a scene breakdown. Nothing exists <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E
5|$|The really curious part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> is that, after {{everything}} had been explained, and all had been restored to their normal courses of action, none of the personages involved in it married each other. They were all so annoyed at having made such fools of themselves that they {{walked out of the}} inn in different directions, and were never seen or heard of again.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} archeological studies of 9th- and 10th-century gords in Greater Poland {{are at odds}} with the timing <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>story.</b> There was no Gniezno {{settlement}} in the 9th century; there was a pagan cult site there beginning only {{at the turn of the}} 10th century. The Gniezno gord was built around year 940, possibly because the location, of great spiritual importance to the tribal community, would rally the local population around its building and defense.|$|E
5|$|Written by Michael Feeney Callan, {{this story}} was {{commissioned}} on 5 February 1985. After {{the news of the}} hiatus, Callan was asked by the production team to continue with the story but as four 25 minute episodes. It had been planned that an adaptation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> would appear as part of Big Finish's The Lost Stories range, but fell through due to the author's other commitments and was replaced by The Macros.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{did not use}} the 3D {{graphics}} which Armok {{had since}} its development was hampered because of it. He cited the ease in development of features like fluid simulation, copyright issues with the art and more unhindered possibilities as further reasons for not using it. Being used to the text-based graphics in roguelikes, he did not want graphical tilesets. The story-generation originated first from Armok, although present to some extent in dragslay. Tarn and Zach would write different chapters of events they would like to see, mix it together and try to implement it. Most <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> writing is managed by Zach, who has a role in the game's development. He graduated in ancient history and books like The Twelve Caesars and the writings of Assyrian kings influenced the game.|$|E

5000|$|The exact date <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>story's</b> {{setting is}} unknown, but since Nancy {{has been married}} for [...] "upward of thirty years" [...] and the Indian Mutiny broke out in 1857, the date {{would seem to be}} {{sometime}} after 1887. The first few lines by Watson tell that <b>this</b> <b>story</b> occurred in the [...] "summer" [...] just after his marriage which was in 1889; thus summer of 1889 would be about right.|$|R

5|$|Several other {{oral traditions}} about the castle survive. One of these {{involves}} a child prisoner within the castle, who escaped, throwing {{the key to}} her dungeon into a nearby field, sometimes argued to be an outcrop of land north-west of the castle, which from then onwards was infertile. Another centres on a man called Gallon who was left {{in charge of the}} castle by Margaret of Anjou and entrusted with a set of valuables; captured by the Yorkists, he escaped and later returned to reclaim six Venetian glasses. The historian Katrina Porteous has noted that in the 14th century there are records of receivers and bailiffs at the castle called Galoun, potentially linked to the origins of the Gallon <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Sayers and Bears {{teammate}} Brian Piccolo {{became the}} first interracial roommates in the NFL. Sayers' ensuing friendship with Piccolo and Piccolo's struggle with cancer (embryonal cell carcinoma, which was diagnosed after it metastasized to a large tumor in his chest cavity), {{became the subject of}} the made-for-TV movie Brian's Song. The movie, in which Sayers was portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the 1971 original and by Mekhi Phifer in the 2001 remake, was adapted from Sayers' account <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> in his 1970 autobiography, I Am Third. A notable aspect of Sayers' friendship with Piccolo, a white man, and the first film's depiction of their friendship, was its effect on race relations. The first film was made in the wake of racial riots, escalating racial tensions fueled by Martin Luther King's assassination, and charges of discrimination across the nation. Sayers and Piccolo were devoted friends and deeply respectful of and affectionate with each other. Piccolo helped Sayers through rehabilitation after injury, and Sayers was by Piccolo's side throughout his illness until his death in June 1970.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{take the}} view that Gregory {{initiated}} the mission, although exactly why remains unclear. A famous story recorded by Bede, an 8th-century monk who wrote {{a history of the}} British Church, relates that Gregory saw fair-haired Anglo-Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people. Supposedly Gregory inquired about the identity of the slaves, and was told that they were Angles from the island of Great Britain. Gregory replied that they were not Angles, but Angels. The earliest version <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> is from an anonymous Life of Gregory written at Whitby Abbey about 705. Bede, as well as the Whitby Life of Gregory, records that Gregory himself had attempted to go on a missionary journey to Britain before becoming pope. In 595 Gregory wrote to one of the papal estate managers in southern Gaul, asking that he buy English slave boys in order that they might be educated in monasteries. Some historians have seen this as a sign that Gregory was already planning the mission to Britain at that time, and that he intended to send the slaves as missionaries, although the letter is also open to other interpretations.|$|E
50|$|The role of Petra Williams {{was given}} to Sheila Dunn when Kate O'Mara was {{unavailable}} to play the part. O'Mara would, years later, be cast as the Rani, a renegade Time Lord.

25|$|Her husband, {{according}} to the vitae, was never troubled by her charity and always supported it.

In either version, it is Avalokiteśvara's outpouring of compassion which manifests Tara as a being.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{veracity}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> {{has been brought}} into question.
