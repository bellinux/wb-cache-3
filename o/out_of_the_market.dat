5|$|On 23 October 2001, the Competition Authority granted {{permission}} for SAS to purchase Braathens. The rationale {{was that there}} were no other realistic purchasers for the airline, and that a bankruptcy was imminent without the take-over. As a condition, the authority decided to regulate a ban on frequent flyer programs, and stated that it would ban cross-subsidization aimed at underbidding or operating at a loss to force new entrants <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century {{there have}} been three large {{fundraising}} campaigns at the Gallery: in 2004, to buy Raphael’s Madonna of the Pinks, in 2008, for Titian's Diana and Actaeon, and in 2012, Titian's Diana and Callisto. Both Titians were bought in tandem with the National Gallery of Scotland for £95m. Both of these major works were sold from the famous collection of the Duke of Sutherland. The National Gallery is now largely priced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> for Old Master paintings and can only make such acquisitions with the backing of major public appeals; the departing director Charles Saumarez Smith expressed his frustration at this situation in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The game changes however if the {{government}} credibly promises to subsidize the domestic firm if it enters the market, as illustrated in Figure 2. Suppose {{the government}} promises a subsidy of twenty million, {{regardless of whether the}} foreign firm also enters or not. In that case, if the foreign firm enters the domestic firm will lose ten million from entry costs but will be more than compensated by the government subsidy, ending up with a net payoff of ten million. If the foreign firm does not enter of course, it is still profitable for the domestic firm to enter. As a result, regardless of the action of the foreign firm, the domestic firm's incentive is to enter the market. Anticipating this, the foreign firm will stay <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> itself, since otherwise it would incur a loss.|$|E

5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy {{to the domestic}} firm is shown in Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both stay <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two Nash equilibria of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) the domestic firm will stay out and the foreign firm will enter.|$|E
5|$|Tudor's {{competitors}} soon {{entered the}} market as well, shipping ice by sea to both Calcutta and Bombay, further increasing demand there and driving {{out most of the}} indigenous ice dealers. A grand ice house was built from stone in Calcutta by the local British community to store the ice imports. Small shipments of chilled fruit and dairy products began to be sent out with the ice, achieving high prices. Attempts were made by Italian traders to introduce ice from the Alps into Calcutta, but Tudor repeated his monopolistic techniques from the Caribbean, driving them and many others <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> Calcutta remained a particularly profitable market for ice for many years; Tudor alone made more than $220,000 ($4,700,000) in profits between 1833 and 1850.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} {{crisis at}} the turn of the 20th century caused many aristocratic families to sell their paintings, but the British national collections were priced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> by American plutocrats. This prompted the foundation of the National Art Collections Fund, a society of subscribers dedicated to stemming the flow of artworks to the United States. Their first acquisition for the National Gallery was Velázquez's Rokeby Venus in 1906, followed by Holbein's Portrait of Christina of Denmark in 1909. However, despite the crisis in aristocratic fortunes, the following decade was one of several great bequests from private collectors. In 1909 the industrialist Dr Ludwig Mond gave 42 Italian renaissance paintings, including the Mond Crucifixion by Raphael, to the Gallery. Other bequests of note were those of George Salting in 1910, Austen Henry Layard in 1916 and Sir Hugh Lane in 1917; the last of these was one of the Gallery's more controversial bequests.|$|E

5|$|The {{international}} ice trade {{continued through}} {{the second half of}} the 19th century, but it increasingly moved away from its former, New England roots. Indeed, ice exports from US peaked around 1870, when 65,802 tons (59,288,000kg), worth $267,702 ($4,610,000 in 2010 terms), were shipped out from the ports. One factor in this was the slow spread of plant ice into India. Exports from New England to India peaked in 1856, when 146,000 tons (132 million kg) were shipped, and the Indian natural ice market faltered during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, dipped again during the American Civil War, and imports of ice slowly declined through the 1860s. Spurred on by the introduction of artificial ice plants around the world by the British Royal Navy, the International Ice Company was founded in Madras in 1874 and the Bengal Ice Company in 1878. Operating together as the Calcutta Ice Association, they rapidly drove natural ice <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E

25|$|Sealing {{reached its}} peak in Newfoundland in the 1860s, with the {{introduction}} of more powerful and reliable steamships that capable of much larger range and storing capacity.

25|$|There {{are three}} old roads <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Market</b> Place: Saddler Street heads south-east, towards Elvet Bridge, the Bailey and Prebends Bridge.

Heading west, Silver Street leads <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Market</b> Place towards Framwellgate Bridge and North Road, the other main shopping area of the city. From here, the city spreads out into the Framwelgate, Crossgate, Neville's Cross and viaduct districts, which are largely residential areas. Beyond the viaduct lie the outlying districts of Framwellgate Moor and Neville's Cross. Heading north from the Market Place leads to Claypath. The road curves back round {{to the east and}} beyond it lie Gilesgate, Gilesgate Moor and Dragonville.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century, {{economic}} discrimination was broadened to include biased or unequal terms against other companies or competing companies. The Robinson-Patman Act (1936), which prevents sellers of commodities in interstate commerce from discriminating in price between purchasers of goods of like grade and quality, was designed to prevent vertically integrated trusts from driving smaller competitors <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> through economies of scale.|$|E
