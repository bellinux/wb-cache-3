5|$|A young white-bellied sea eagle in {{its first}} year is {{predominantly}} brown, with pale cream-streaked plumage on their head, neck, nape and rump areas. The plumage becomes more infiltrated with white until it acquires the complete adult plumage by the fourth <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> year. The species breeds from around six years of age onwards. The lifespan is thought to be around 30 years.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{of modern}} human {{habitation}} in Malaysia dates back 40,000years. In the Malay Peninsula, the first inhabitants {{are thought to}} be Negritos. Traders and settlers from India and China arrived as early as the first century AD, establishing trading ports and coastal towns {{in the second and third}} centuries. Their presence resulted in strong Indian and Chinese influences on the local cultures, and the people of the Malay Peninsula adopted the religions of Hinduism and Buddhism. Sanskrit inscriptions appear as early as the fourth <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> century. The Kingdom of Langkasuka arose around the second century in the northern area of the Malay Peninsula, lasting until about the 15th century. Between the 7th and 13th centuries, much of the southern Malay Peninsula was part of the maritime Srivijayan empire. By the 13th and the 14th century, the Majapahit empire had successfully wrested control over most of the peninsula and the Malay Archipelago from Srivijaya. Islam began to spread among Malays in the 14th century. In the early 15th century, Parameswara, a runaway king of the former Kingdom of Singapura linked to the old Srivijayan court, founded the Malacca Sultanate. Melaka was an important commercial centre during this time, attracting trade from around the region.|$|E
5|$|In December1994, CSU {{predicted}} that only 12named storms would form and 8of those would become hurricanes; 3major hurricanes were projected. CSU noted an above average season due to expectations {{that the existing}} El Niño would dissipate, while a La Niña would develop {{by the summer of}} 1995. Additionally, the western areas of the Sahara Desert were predicted to have the fourth <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> rainiest season since 1970. A year with heavier precipitation in this region usually correlates with an active Atlantic hurricane season. In April1995, CSU revised their forecast, decreasing the number of named storms to 10, hurricanes to 6, and major hurricanes to 2. However, in June, CSU reverted to their December forecast, which called for 12named storms, 8hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes. The forecast by the WRC in early 1995 was 10named storms and 6hurricanes, with no prediction on the number of major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the birds}} begin to forage on their own, they {{move away from}} their parents' territory; young birds have been found nearly 500km away from their nest site. One-year-old European birds migrate to Africa and stay there {{for at least one}} year. A vulture that fledged in France stayed in Africa for three years before {{migrating}} north in spring. After migrating back to their breeding areas, young birds move widely in search of good feeding territories and mates. The full adult plumage is attained in the fourth <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> year. Egyptian vultures have been known to live for up to 37 years in captivity and at least 21 years in the wild. The probability of survival in the wild varies with age, increasing till the age of 2 and then falling at the age of 5. Older birds have an annual survival probability varying from 0.75 for non-breeders to 0.83 for breeding birds.|$|E

A single <b>fifth</b> <b>or</b> octave approached {{this way is}} sometimes called an exposed <b>fifth</b> <b>or</b> exposed octave. Conventional style dictates that such a progression be avoided; but it is sometimes permitted under certain conditions, such as the following: the interval does not involve either the highest or the lowest part, the interval does not occur between both of those extreme parts, the interval is approached in one part by a semitone step, or the interval is approached in the higher part by step. The details differ considerably from period to period, and even among composers writing in the same period.|$|R

5|$|Other public bills {{could no}} longer be vetoed; instead, they could be delayed for up to two years. This two-year period meant that {{legislation}} introduced in the fourth <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> years of a parliament could be delayed until after the next election, which could prove an effective measure to prevent it being passed. Specifically, two years had to elapse between the second reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the passing of the bill in the House of Commons in the third session. The Speaker has to also certify that the conditions of the bill had been complied with. Significant restrictions on amendments are made to ensure that it is the same bill that has been rejected twice. The 1911 Act made clear that the life of a parliament could not be extended without the consent of the Lords.|$|E

The Dodgers pinch hit for Roebuck to lead {{off the top of}} the inning with Ken McMullen and although he singled he did not score. Larry Sherry entered to pitch for the Dodgers in the bottom of the inning and after recording the first out he allowed back-to-back home runs to Mays and Orlando Cepeda to give the Giants a 5–0 lead. Davenport then singled and Sherry was relieved by Jack Smith who finished the inning without further damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} Singapore Harbour was codenamed Operation Jaywick, {{the brand name}} of a popular {{lavatory}} deodoriser, and {{had nothing to do}} with guerrillas <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> columnists. It had been carried out by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Lyon from 'Z' Special Unit, a group of AngloAustralian commandos who had sailed from Western Australia to Singapore in an old Japanese fishing boat, the Krait, named after a Malayan snake. Once within striking distance of the harbour, the commandos took to folboats (folding canoes), and paddled into the docks under cover of night. Using limpet mines, they sank six Japanese ships of 2,0005,000 tons, including several tankers, and then slipped away to their rendezvous with the Krait, finally returning successfully to Australia. (The Krait is now preserved and on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney). The Japanese could not conceive that a force could penetrate their lines of defence and have the audacity to attack their shipping. They therefore concluded that it must have been an internal operation, carried out by Chinese guerrillas organised from Changi Prison.|$|E

5|$|The {{demographic}} characteristics of the population of Croatia are known through censuses, normally conducted in ten-year intervals and analysed by various statistical bureaus since the 1850s. The Croatian Bureau of Statistics has performed this task since the 1990s. The latest census in Croatia was performed in April 2011. The permanent population of Croatia at the 2011 census had reached 4.29 million. The population density is 75.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, and the overall life expectancy in Croatia at birth was 78 years in 2012. The population rose steadily (with the exception of censuses taken following the two world wars) from 2.1 million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7 million. Since 1991, Croatia's death rate has continuously exceeded its birth rate; the natural growth rate of the population is negative. Croatia is in the fourth <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> stage of the demographic transition. In terms of age structure, the population is dominated by the 15‑ to 64‑year‑old segment. The median age of the population is 41.4, and the gender ratio of the total population is 0.93 males per 1 female.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} of the wing buds is of a thickening of the hypodermis, which {{can be observed in}} insect species as early the embryo, and in the earliest stages of the life cycle. During the development of morphological features while in the embryo, or embryogenesis, a cluster of cells grow underneath the ectoderm which later in development, after the lateral ectoderm has grown dorsally to form wind imaginal disc. An example of wing bud development in the larvae, can be seen in those of White butterflies (Pieris). In the second instar the histoblast become more prominent, which now form a pocket-like structure. As of the third and fourth instars, the histoblast become more elongated. This greatly extended and evaginated, or protruding, part is what becomes the wing. By the close of the last instar, <b>or</b> <b>fifth,</b> the wing is pushed out of the wing-pocket, although continues to lie under the old larval cuticle while in its prepupal stage. It is not until the butterfly is in its pupal stage that the wing-bud becomes exposed, and shortly after eclosion, the wing begins to expand and form its definitive shape.|$|E
5|$|With a {{population}} of 4.29million in 2011, Croatia ranks 125th {{in the world by}} population. Its population density is 75.8 inhabitants per square kilometre. The overall life expectancy in Croatia at birth is 78 years. The total fertility rate of 1.50 children per mother is one of the lowest in the world. Since 1991, Croatia's death rate has nearly continuously exceeded its birth rate. The Croatian Bureau of Statistics forecast that the population may even shrink to 3.1million by 2051, depending on the actual birth rate and the level of net migration. The population of Croatia rose steadily from 2.1million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7million, with the exception of censuses taken in 1921 and 1948, i.e. following two world wars. The natural growth rate of the population is negative. Croatia started advancing from the first stage of the demographic transition in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (depending on where in Croatia is being discussed). Croatia is in the fourth <b>or</b> <b>fifth</b> stage of the demographic transition.|$|E
