25|$|<b>Organizational</b> <b>culture</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as a set of assumptions shared by individuals in an organization; the assumptions influence the interpretation and actions that define appropriate behavior for various situations. <b>Organizational</b> <b>culture</b> has been shown to affect important organizational outcomes such as performance, attraction, recruitment, retention, employee satisfaction, and employee well-being. There are three levels of organizational culture: artifacts, shared values, and basic beliefs and assumptions. Artifacts comprise the physical components of the organization that relay cultural meaning. Shared values are individuals' preferences regarding certain aspects of the organization's culture (e.g., loyalty, customer service). Basic beliefs and assumptions include individuals' impressions about the trustworthiness and supportiveness of an organization, and are often deeply ingrained within the organization's culture.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, social psychologists, {{organizational}} scientists, {{and management}} scientists who conduct extensive {{research on the}} factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and <b>organizational</b> <b>culture,</b> as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation.|$|E

25|$|This {{knowledge}} is embedded and carried through multiple entities including <b>organizational</b> <b>culture</b> and identity, policies, routines, documents, systems, and employees. Originating from the strategic management literature, this perspective builds upon and extends the resource-based {{view of the}} firm (RBV) initially promoted by Penrose (1959) and later expanded by others (Wernerfelt 1984, Barney 1991, Conner 1991).|$|E
25|$|When youth {{participate}} in established empowerment programs {{they see a}} variety of benefits. The practices of youth involvement and empowerment become embedded within the <b>organizational</b> <b>culture</b> and the community culture. Adults and organizations also benefit from empowerment programs. The both become more connected and responsive to youth in the community, which leads to program improvements as well as increased participation from youth.|$|E
25|$|I/O {{psychologists have}} also {{employed}} qualitative methods, which largely involve focus groups, interviews, and case studies. I/O research on <b>organizational</b> <b>culture</b> research has employed ethnographic techniques and participant observation. A qualitative technique associated with I/O psychology is Flanagan's Critical Incident Technique. I/O psychologists sometimes use {{quantitative and qualitative}} methods in concert. OHP researchers have also combined and coordinated quantitative and qualitative methods within a single study.|$|E
40|$|This paper explores how {{approaches}} to new product design can differ nationally when examining large <b>organizational</b> <b>cultures</b> between the East and the West, especially looking at different approaches {{in the context}} of ‘openness’. Currently, {{approaches to}} new product development in digital landscape have shifted to evolutionary perspectives, which embrace an ‘open’ context in the design process – ‘designing’, rather than single hierarchical and closed strategy for efficiency- ‘controlling’. This paper highlights that NPD process in Far Eastern Asia’s <b>organizational</b> <b>cultures</b> have been underlined in single hierarchical <b>organizational</b> <b>cultures</b> resulting in engineered product design under ‘controlling’, rather than ‘designing’...|$|R

The pace and direction of these changes will profoundly challenge libraries and their staffs to respond effectively. This paper presents the results of a survey that was designed to discern the perceptions and preferences of future library leaders related to <b>organizational</b> <b>cultures</b> in these times of precipitous change. The study finds that future leaders of academic libraries perceive a significant gap between their current and preferred <b>organizational</b> <b>cultures</b> and that current <b>organizational</b> <b>cultures</b> limit their effectiveness...|$|R

25|$|Because {{wearing a}} suit conveys a respectable image, many people wear suits during the job {{interview}} process. An interview suit is usually a conservative style, and often made of blue or grey fabric. Interview suits are frequently composed of wool or wool-blend fabric, with a solid or pin stripe pattern. The style of an interview suit, however, {{will depend on the}} <b>organizational</b> <b>culture</b> of the industry in which a person seeks employment.|$|E
25|$|In I/O psychology, {{leadership}} can {{be defined}} as a process of influencing others to agree on a shared purpose, and to work towards shared objectives. A distinction should be made between leadership and management. Managers process administrative tasks and organize work environments. Although leaders may be required to undertake managerial duties as well, leaders typically focus on inspiring followers and creating a shared <b>organizational</b> <b>culture</b> and values. Managers deal with complexity, while leaders deal with initiating and adapting to change. Managers undertake the tasks of planning, budgeting, organizing, staffing, controlling and problem solving. In contrast, leaders undertake the tasks of setting a direction or vision, aligning people to shared goals, communicating, and motivating.|$|E
25|$|Several design {{elements}} {{are needed to}} enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an <b>organizational</b> <b>culture</b> must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.|$|E

25|$|On August 26, 2003, the CAIB {{issued its}} {{report on the}} accident. The report {{confirmed}} the immediate cause of the accident was a breach in {{the leading edge of}} the left wing, caused by insulating foam shed during launch. The report also delved deeply into the underlying organizational and cultural issues that led to the accident. The report was highly critical of NASA's decision-making and risk-assessment processes. It concluded the organizational structure and processes were sufficiently flawed and that a compromise of safety was expected no matter who was in the key decision-making positions. An example was the position of Shuttle Program Manager, where one individual was responsible for achieving safe, timely launches and acceptable costs, which are often conflicting goals. The CAIB report found that NASA had accepted deviations from design criteria as normal when they happened on several flights and did not lead to mission-compromising consequences. One of those was the conflict between a design specification stating that the thermal protection system was not designed to withstand significant impacts and the common occurrence of impact damage to it during flight. The board made recommendations for significant changes in processes and <b>organizational</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E

On 7 January, Ellen Wibe {{presented a}} competing plan of action together with Oscar Hillgaar, Ellen Christine Christiansen and Geir Thoresen. Wibe's plan criticized the party's <b>organizational</b> <b>culture,</b> communication and institutions. In an interview, Wibe said that the party was too similar to a [...] "charismatic movement", and that she wanted more power to the central board (...) [...] Øystein Hedstrøm announced a possible motion of no confidence regarding Ellen Wibe's position as deputy party leader, even though she was not really up for election until 1995.

500|$|According to Reiser, Cameron {{cast him}} against type as a villain.

Ellen Ripley, a 2004 literary analysis of the Alien franchise, Jason Smith and Ximena Gallardo-C. describe Burke as a [...] "monster" [...] who is the by-product of <b>organizational</b> <b>culture</b> and willing to have Ripley and Newt impregnated for capital gain because of their [...] "'natural' wombs". In a deleted scene during Ripley's incursion into the Alien hive, shown in the 2010 Blu-ray edition of the Alien Anthology, she discovers a cocooned Burke who reveals {{that he has been}} impregnated; he begs Ripley to kill him, but instead she hands him a grenade for him to detonate.|$|E

40|$|Currently school {{organizations}} {{are under pressure}} to achieve excellence. There is no exception to this pressure in the schools of Hong Kong. Research into <b>organizational</b> <b>cultures</b> of excellent schools in Hong Kong is seeking evidence for others striving for excellence. Excellent schools are defined as few schools that have many aspects that outweigh their counterparts to a great extent. This study adopted an "etic " view on <b>organizational</b> <b>cultures,</b> in contrast to an "emic " view. An "etic " perspective of culture allows the quantitative assessments of <b>organizational</b> <b>cultures</b> across schools. Furthermore, it renders possible comparisons between the characteristics of excellent schools, and that of their counterparts. A questionnaire method was employed in this study. An instrument, "School Values Inventory " (SVI), was created for the study.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} how different <b>organizational</b> <b>cultures</b> influence the bias of a working environment in terms of effectiveness. Effectiveness should be understood as the the capacity of a firm to adapt to external changes and to facilitate its internal processes. The focus of the research is centered on two case studies; two firms both settled in the North-East of Italy, which are different in terms of scope. The first is a manufacture company named Ideal Lux, which produces lamps; {{the other one is}} a venture capital company, named H-Farm, which is a start-up accelerator. At a primary stage the two <b>organizational</b> <b>cultures</b> are described.

The final aim {{is to be able to}} make bigger generalizations and open up to a broader understanding upon managing different <b>organizational</b> <b>cultures...</b>|$|R
40|$|The 1991 Persian Gulf War is a “most likely” {{case for}} several crisis {{decision-making}} models. It commanded presidential attention, arose when bureaucrats were fighting over post-Cold War budgets, and evoked the strong <b>organizational</b> <b>cultures</b> of the U. S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. We use {{this case to}} assess the contexts, decision stages, and issue areas in which alternative crisis models have the most explanatory power. We find that presidents are most powerful in agenda setting, choosing among options, crises, and high-politics issues. Bureaucratic politics diminishes in crises and best explains the behavior of mid-level careerists, the formulation of options, and the shaping of post-war budgets. Most striking, even in crises <b>organizational</b> <b>cultures</b> strongly shape tactical military decisions, choices among weapons systems, and the willingness of officials to risk their careers {{on behalf of their}} organizations' values. Overall, these findings argue for greater attention to the influence of <b>organizational</b> <b>cultures</b> in crises...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Organizational</b> <b>culture</b> is a {{determining}} factor in successful BPR implementation. [...] <b>Organizational</b> <b>culture</b> influences the organization’s {{ability to adapt}} to change. [...] Culture in an organization is a self-reinforcing set of beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. [...] Culture {{is one of the}} most resistant elements of organizational behavior and is extremely difficult to change. BPR must consider current culture in order to change these beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors effectively. [...] Messages conveyed from management in an organization continually enforce current culture. [...] Change is implicitly driven by motivation which is fueled by the recognition of the need for change.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to an overall culture, organizations also have subcultures. Examples of subcultures include corporate culture, departmental culture, local culture, and issue-related culture.
