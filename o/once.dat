It was later relocated <b>once</b> again {{and it is now}} in Floriana.|$|E

5|$|As {{the fare}} {{system has been}} {{integrated}} by TransitLink, commuters need to pay only one fare and pass through two fare gates (<b>once</b> on entry, <b>once</b> on exit) for an entire journey for most interchange stations, even when transferring between lines operated by different companies. Commuters can choose to extend a trip mid-journey, and pay the difference when they exit their destination station.|$|E

From Spain, Trajan was summoned, while Domitian himself came from Rome with the Praetorian Guard.|$|E
5|$|At the New York–Pennsylvania {{border in}} Ripley, PA5 becomes NY5 upon {{entering}} New York. It very closely follows {{the shore of}} Lake Erie through all of Chautauqua County. <b>Once</b> reaching the village of Silver Creek it briefly overlaps US20 until entering Erie County at the Cattaraugus Reservation and NY438 where the roads <b>once</b> again split. <b>Once</b> in Erie County it pulls slightly inward from the lake shore from Brant to the hamlet of Wanakah. <b>Once</b> past Wanakah, the road <b>once</b> again closely borders the lake shore and goes through steadily more heavily developed areas, particularly the Ford Stamping Plant and the Bethlehem Steel plant {{in the city of}} Lackawanna where the road is called the Hamburg Turnpike and eight wind powered turbines, which pump power into the national grid are visible. Near the northern edge of the city, NY5 begins to ascend onto an elevated roadway as it connects to Ridge Road and the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens by way of an interchange. Here, the route becomes the Buffalo Skyway, a limited-access highway with exits for Ohio and Tifft streets and Fuhrmann Boulevard. After a quarter-mile, NY5 passes seamlessly into the city of Buffalo.|$|E

5|$|Chapter 53 {{begins with}} Gangleri asking {{if any of}} the gods will survive, and if there will be {{anything}} left of the earth or the sky. High responds that the earth will appear <b>once</b> more from the sea, beautiful and green, where self-sown crops grow. The field Iðavöllr exists where Asgard <b>once</b> was, and, there, untouched by Surtr's flames, Víðarr and Váli reside. Now possessing their father's hammer Mjölnir, Thor's sons Móði and Magni will meet them there, and, coming from Hel, Baldr and Höðr also arrive. Together, they all sit and recount memories, later finding the gold game pieces the Æsir <b>once</b> owned. Völuspá stanza 51 is then quoted.|$|E
