5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts {{sirenians}} at risk. Sirenians, especially the West Indian manatee, face high mortality from watercraft collision, {{and about half}} of all West Indian manatee deaths are caused by watercraft collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, which can lead to vessel collisions, and manatees may become entangled in navigational locks. The urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> in Florida are generally the result of discharge from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling systems may disrupt the pattern <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> refuges, and an increased demand for artesian springs for water, the natural source <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water,</b> decreases the number <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> refuges. Sirenians can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. African manatees have also been known to venture into rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the manatees.|$|E

5|$|Despite a {{decrease}} in convection shortly after forming, the large depression remained well organized, with a wind field 575mi (930km) in diameter. On August 22, as it passed 140mi (225km) to south of the Cape Verde islands, deep convection developed over the center of circulation, and early on August 23 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Debby about 300mi (485km) southwest of Cape Verde. Banding features continued to organize as the system slowly strengthened, and on August 23 Debby attained a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) over the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters predicted Debby to continue to intensify to attain hurricane status, while its projected path placed the storm in an area <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> temperatures and moderate upper level shear.|$|E
5|$|With the {{subtropical}} ridge to the northeast, the nascent system moved northwestward initially. Despite persistent shear dislocating the convection, the JMA upgraded {{the system to}} a tropical storm at 12:00UTC on July2, naming it Linfa.

On July3, Linfa's track briefly shifted to the southwest, by which time the convective structure had evolved into a central dense overcast. There was uncertainty in the storm's future as it approached the Philippines. This was due to potential interaction with Typhoon Chan-hom to the northeast, and differences in storm models whether an approaching trough would turn Linfa to the east or the west.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa behind Hurricane Luis on August 31. Strong outflow from Luis prevented development of the wave, and it continued westward until crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 12. Convection increased as it moved through the Gulf of Tehuantepec, and the cloud pattern organized sufficiently to warrant Dvorak classifications for the system on September 15. Based on the development of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Eleven-E on September 16 while located around 290miles (465km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Due to the tropical depression moving over an area <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> temperatures with favorable upper level outflow, the National Hurricane Center forecast the tropical depression to slowly intensify to 70mph (110km/h) winds within 72hours the forecast early on September 16.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Fabian was a {{powerful}} Cape Verde-type hurricane that hit Bermuda in early September during the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Fabian was the most recent major hurricane to directly impact Bermuda until Hurricane Nicole of 2016. It was the sixth named storm, fourth hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season, developed from a tropical wave in the tropical Atlantic Ocean on August 25. It moved west-northwestward {{under the influence of}} the subtropical ridge to its north, and steadily strengthened in an area <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> temperatures and light wind shear. The hurricane attained a peak intensity of 145mph (230km/h) on September 1, and it slowly weakened as it turned northward. On September 5, Fabian made a direct hit on Bermuda with wind speeds of over 120mph (195km/h). After passing the island, the hurricane turned to the northeast, and became extratropical on September 8.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} May 2010, a {{surge in}} the monsoon {{produced}} widespread convection, or thunderstorms, off the southwest coast of India in the southeastern Arabian Sea. After a low-level circulation became evident on May30, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated {{the system as a}} low pressure area. The low moved northwestward within an area <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> temperatures of , moderate wind shear, and an upper-level environment conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) first noted the system on May30 as an area of potential development. The circulation became more defined within the building convection, which was amplified by outflow from an anticyclone over the northern Arabian Sea. At 03:00Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on May31, the IMD designated the system as a depression about 1,000km (620mi) west-southwest of Mumbai, India, or about 1,260km (785mi) southeast of Muscat, Oman. At 18:00UTC, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the storm, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 03A.|$|E
5|$|With a {{ridge to}} the east, the system tracked to the north-northwest through an area <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> temperatures. At 1200UTC on September30, the JMA {{upgraded}} the depression to Tropical Storm Fitow. Although outflow and convection increased in general, the thunderstorm activity diminished over the center due to sinking air. By late on October1, however, convection increased over Fitow's center, {{and the next}} day the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm. On October2, an eye began developing on satellite imagery, although the rainbands wrapping into the eye were fragmented. It took until midday on October3 for the JTWC to upgrade Fitow to typhoon status, with 1minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph). By that time, the convection had increased in coverage and intensity, with outflow increased by a trough to the north. The JMA did not follow suit until 1200UTC on October4, by which time the eye had become better defined.|$|E

5|$|Some of Antarctica {{has been}} warming up; {{particularly}} strong warming {{has been noted}} on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted {{for the first time}} that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05°C (0.09°F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1°C (0.2°F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.|$|E
5|$|With a mid-level ridge {{located in}} the Gulf of Mexico, the {{depression}} drifted generally northward through an area <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> temperatures and low wind shear. Initially its convection was weak and confined to a few rainbands far from the center. As such, intensification was not expected beyond minimal tropical storm status. However, the system quickly developed intense thunderstorms near the center with increased banding in its southern semicircle, and at 1500UTC on May 29 the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Alma, about 55miles (85km) southwest of Managua, Nicaragua. Its intensity was set at 45mph (75km/h), and the storm was forecast to intensity only slightly more before moving ashore. However, one hour after it was upgraded to tropical storm status, the NHC re-assessed the intensity as 65mph (100km/h), citing updated observations from satellite imagery and QuikSCAT. An eye feature formed, surrounded by a very tight ring of convection, and at around 1900UTC on May 29 Alma made landfall near León, Nicaragua as a strong tropical storm. The storm quickly weakened after moving ashore, though a small area of thunderstorms persisted as it crossed into the mountainous region of southern Honduras. After passing near Tegucigalpa Alma weakened to tropical depression status, and at 1500UTC on May 30 the cyclone dissipated near the border of Honduras and Guatemala. On May 31, after crossing Central America as a low pressure area, Alma's remnants moved into the Gulf of Honduras and spawned Tropical Storm Arthur.|$|E
5|$|Located {{in an area}} <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> {{temperatures}} and light wind shear, Hurricane Paul continued to intensify and organize; its well-defined eye {{was surrounded by a}} ring of deep convection while outflow remained strong to the north and south. On October23, while located 465miles (750km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Paul reached its peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h), a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A large trough located off the west coast of California turned the hurricane to the north-northwest, and later to the north. The combination of increasing shear and dry air quickly weakened Paul to a tropical storm on October24 as its low-level circulation became detached from the diminishing convection. The storm then turned to the northeast after passing near Socorro Island. Despite increasing wind shear of over 50mph (80km/h), Paul remained a tropical storm while its circulation remained on the southwest side of its developing deep convection. Early on October25, the storm passed about 100miles (160km) south of the southern tip of Baja California. The circulation briefly became involved with the deep convection as it accelerated northeastward, though as it approached the coast of Sinaloa, the center again decoupled from the upper level circulation. Later that day, Paul weakened to a tropical depression a short distance off the coast of Mexico, and turned to the north. Early the next day, the depression, devoid of any deep convection, made landfall near Isla Altamura in northwestern Sinaloa. Hours later, the National Hurricane Center issued the last advisory on the dissipating tropical depression.|$|E

This study provides evidence gained from remote-sensing data, oceanographic data and oceanographic modeling, that three factors caused this excessive heating, namely: 1) the shutdown of the North Queensland Coastal Current, which would otherwise have flushed and cooled the Northern Coral Sea and the NGBR through tidal mixing 2) the advection <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> (> 30  °C) water from the Gulf of Carpentaria eastward through Torres Strait and then southward over the NGBR continental shelf, and 3) presumably local solar heating.
