25|$|Organophosphates are {{acetylcholinesterase}} inhibitors {{and cause}} excitatory paralysis leading {{to death of}} sea lice when given as a bath treatment. Dichlorvos was used {{for many years in}} Europe and later replaced by azamethiphos, the active ingredient in Salmosan, which is safer for operators to handle. Azamethiphos is water-soluble and broken down relatively quickly in the environment. Resistance to organophosphates began to develop in Norway in the mid 1990s, apparently due to acetylcholinesterases being altered due to mutation. Use has declined considerably with the introduction <b>of</b> <b>SLICE,</b> emamectin benzoate.|$|E
500|$|Six {{years after}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 9/10, describing it as [...] "amazing". He especially liked Lovitz' performance Artie Ziff, calling it [...] "pitch-perfect" [...] {{and that one of}} his favourite lines [...] "stands out" [...] because of Lovitz's [...] "great delivery". Canning also enjoyed the prom scene as well as Lenny and Carl's implied intimate relationship, which he described as [...] "a completely unexpected treat". He summarized the episode as [...] "top-notch" [...] and wrote [...] "The writing was smart and tight, and instead of a B storyline, the half-hour was filled out with a number of great throwaway gags [...] It's true we may have never expected to see Artie Ziff again, but [...] "Half-Decent Proposal" [...] was a welcome and very funny return." [...] In January 2010, following the conclusion of The Simpsonss twentieth season, IGN chose [...] "Half-Decent Proposal" [...] as the best episode from the thirteenth season, and following the thirteenth season's home video release, reviewer R.L. Shaffer called it one of the season's [...] "gems [...] with good reason". Both Michael Hikcerson <b>of</b> <b>Slice</b> of SciFi and Rosie Fletcher of Total Film considered [...] "Half-Decent Proposal" [...] {{to be one of the}} season's best episodes, with Fletcher calling it a [...] "stand-out". Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com gave it a positive review as well, describing it as a [...] "strong character-centric episode".|$|E

2500|$|On May 31, 2008, Slice {{fought in}} the main event of the first ever mixed martial arts event shown on prime time network television, [...] Though one of the judges had each fighter winning {{one of the first}} two rounds, Slice's {{opponent}} James Thompson won both on total points by repeatedly taking down Slice and grounding and pounding. In the opening seconds of the third round, however, Slice threw a haymaker to Thompson's left ear, which ruptured Thompson's cauliflower. This was soon followed by three unanswered punches to a standing Thompson, which led to a referee stoppage and the controversial win for Slice. Fellow EliteXC competitor Brett Rogers was particularly critical of Slice's victory, calling Slice's performance [...] "garbage" [...] in a post fight interview. Frank Mir was also a critic <b>of</b> <b>Slice,</b> stating in an interview that [...] "every time Kimbo Slice fights, it sets (mixed martial arts) back".|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{sufficient}} dimension reduction, {{the goal is to}} parsimoniously recover the central subspace of a regression model. Many inverse regression methods use slicing estimation to recover the central subspace. The efficacy <b>of</b> <b>slicing</b> estimation depends heavily upon the number <b>of</b> <b>slices.</b> However, the selection of the number <b>of</b> <b>slices</b> is an open and long-standing problem. In this paper, we propose a discretization-expectation estimation method, which avoids selecting the number <b>of</b> <b>slices,</b> while preserving the integrity of the central subspace. This generic method assures root-n consistency and asymptotic normality <b>of</b> <b>slicing</b> estimators for many inverse regression methods, and can be applied to regressions with multivariate responses. A BIC -type criterion for the dimension of the central subspace is proposed. Comprehensive simulations and an illustrative application show that our method compares favourably with existing estimators. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

After reviewing the definitions and basic properties, we determine the sliceconnectivity of various families of naturally arising spectra. This leads to an analysis <b>of</b> pullbacks <b>of</b> <b>slices</b> defined on quotient groups, producing new collections <b>of</b> <b>slices.</b> Building on this, we determine the slice tower for the Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum associated to a Mackey functor for a cyclic p-group. We then relate the Postnikov tower to the slice tower for various spectra. Finally, we pose a few conjectures about the nature <b>of</b> <b>slices</b> and pullbacks. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{well-known}} technique <b>of</b> program <b>slicing</b> to synchronous reactive programs like Esterel.

The traditional definition <b>of</b> <b>slicing</b> that preserves the values of a program variable at a particular program point is not natural for reactive programs. We have given a new notion <b>of</b> <b>slicing</b> that preserves the ongoing behaviour of a program with respect {{to one or more}} events. The classical definition of control dependency is inadequate for correctly capturing all the control dependencies in reactive programs. Two such dependencies are interference control dependency and time dependency. A slicing algorithm, based upon the proposed definition <b>of</b> <b>slicing,</b> is also presented...|$|R
