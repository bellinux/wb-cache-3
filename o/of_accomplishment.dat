5|$|The game's design also {{received}} acclaim. Carter from Destructoid {{thought that the}} fortress and the outpost system provided players with a sense <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> and success, and he considered having the freedom to use different ways to approach and complete missions {{one of the greatest}} parts of the game. In addition, Carter applauded the game's driving mechanics and the auto-drive feature, which he considered a significant improvement for the series. However he criticized the upgrade system, which he thought was directly converted from Far Cry 3 and was uninspiring. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Harmon thought that the introduction of the helicopter was dull. Mitch Dyer, from IGN, praised the game's economy system, which he thought was satisfying. He added that it gives players motivations to complete side-quests. Justin McElroy of Polygon praised the introduction of the grappling hook and the vertical map-design, which he thought had allowed players to develop strategy before taking action. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu {{praised the}} idea of making a game based around trials, which they found to be innovative, and found it exhilarating and fun to uncover witnesses' lies. Thomas Bowskill at Nintendo Life said that the game had changed his idea of what can make for a great game, and called it a masterpiece. Carrie Gouskos at GameSpot said that the game revitalized the {{adventure}} game genre. Michael Cole at Nintendo World Report said that the game's design and interface would make it a good choice for non-gamers as well. Bowskill called the investigation sections tedious and boring at times, but said that they were outweighed by the feeling <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> from solving the cases. Craig Harris at IGN felt that the main issues with the game were its linearity, and how the puzzles are simple because of how the player can stop a witness testimony at any time. Cole, too, felt that the game was very linear, and that it was unclear how to proceed at certain points. He said that, because of how story-driven it is, the game has low replay value; he still felt that players might want to replay it after a few years.|$|E
40|$|This thesis uses Kentucky as a {{case study}} of gender {{differences}} in the policy priorities and perceptions <b>of</b> <b>accomplishments</b> <b>of</b> state legislators. The research question is, “are there gender differences in the legislative priorities and perceptions <b>of</b> <b>accomplishments</b> <b>of</b> Kentucky legislators?” The legislative priorities of the legislators seemed to be similar, along with their own classification of women’s issues. The perceptions of success demonstrated that male legislators were not necessarily more likely to attribute success to themselves, whereas women would attribute success to collaboration efforts. The research was completed through confidential interviews with Kentucky legislators and analysis of the 2015 legislative session bill data. The study of gender differences in policy priorities and perceptions <b>of</b> <b>accomplishments</b> <b>of</b> state legislators is an opportunity to gain insight on the effects of having few women in the state legislature...|$|R

25|$|The first ostensive {{goal of a}} BMX racer is {{to become}} the number one amateur racer in your district. The racer's home state/province maybe divided up into several Districts {{depending}} how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. Too many people in a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having a sense <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> if they are doing reasonably well but not advancing his point score up the list of total points {{in relation to other}} racers. Too small a district would cheapen any sense <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> due to paucity of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine how well you do in the district rankings. How high you go in the rankings depends on what skill level category you are in as well as how well you do in your particular races since it affects how many points you win, which adds to your total for your district ranking. The higher your skill level, the more points you will gather at any given race (providing that you have qualified for the Main).|$|E

25|$|Shiraz {{is proud}} of being mother land of Hafiz Shirazi, Shiraz is a center for Iranian culture and has {{produced}} a number of famous poets. Saadi, a 12th- and 13th-century poet was born in Shiraz. He left his native town {{at a young age}} for Baghdad to study Arabic literature and Islamic sciences at Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad. When he reappeared in his native Shiraz he was an elderly man. Shiraz, under Atabak Abubakr Sa'd ibn Zangy (1231–1260) was enjoying an era of relative tranquility. Saadi was not only welcomed to the city but he was highly respected by the ruler and enumerated among the greats of the province. He seems to have spent {{the rest of his life}} in Shiraz. Hafiz, another famous poet and mystic was also born in Shiraz. A number of scientists also originate from Shiraz. Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi, a 13th-century astronomer, mathematician, physician, physicist and scientist was from Shiraz. In his The Limit <b>of</b> <b>Accomplishment</b> concerning Knowledge of the Heavens, he also discussed the possibility of heliocentrism.|$|E
25|$|Promoting {{independence}} in self-care can provide {{older adults with}} the capability to maintain independence longer and can leave them {{with a sense of}} achievement when they complete a task unaided. Older adults that require assistance with activities of daily living are at a greater risk of losing their independence with self-care tasks as dependent personal behaviours are often met with reinforcement from caregivers. It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status in an older adult that has physical limitations. Caregivers need to be conscious of actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform self-care may allow them to see the benefit in performing self-care independently. If the older adult is able to complete self-care activities on their own, or even if they need supervision, encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence can provide them with a sense <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> and the ability to maintain independence longer.|$|E

500|$|By the 18th century, sampler making {{had become}} an {{important}} part of girls' education in boarding and institutional schools. [...] A commonplace component was now an alphabet with numerals, possibly accompanied by various crowns and coronets, all used in marking household linens. [...] Traditional embroidered motifs were now rearranged into decorative borders framing lengthy inscriptions or verses of an [...] "improving" [...] nature and small pictorial scenes. [...] These new samplers were more useful as a record <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> to be hung on the wall than as a practical stitch guide.|$|E
500|$|In November 2001, Ronald Isley {{stated that}} Aaliyah and the Isley Brothers had {{discussed}} a collaboration {{prior to her}} death. She had previously covered the Isley Brothers' single [...] "At Your Best (You Are Love)". By 2001, Aaliyah had enjoyed her now seven-year career and felt a sense <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment.</b> [...] "This is what I always wanted," [...] she said of her career in Vibe magazine.

500|$|With demobilization, the WAVES {{received}} accolades {{from the}} highest sources. Secretary of the Navy Forrestal wrote, [...] "Your conduct, discharge of military responsibilities, and skillful work are in the highest tradition of the naval service." [...] Fleet Admiral King said, The Navy has learned to appreciate the women... for their discipline, their skill, and their contribution to high morale... Our greatest tribute to these women is the request for more WAVES". Fleet Admiral Nimitz went on to say, they have demonstrated qualities of competence, energy and loyalty".

500|$|Jennifer Shrader Lawrence {{was born}} on August 15, 1990 in Indian Hills, Kentucky, to Gary, a {{construction}} worker, and Karen ( [...] Koch), a summer camp manager. She has two older brothers, Ben and Blaine, and her mother brought her up to be [...] "tough" [...] like them. Lawrence's mother did not allow her to play with other girls in preschool as she deemed her [...] "too rough" [...] with them. The actress was educated at the Kammerer Middle School in Louisville. She did not enjoy her childhood due to hyperactivity and social anxiety, and considered herself a misfit among her peers. Lawrence has said that her anxieties vanished when she performed on stage, and that acting gave her a sense <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment.</b>|$|E
500|$|Controversy arose {{during the}} music video's {{development}} when Azalea intended {{to wear a}} red, high-waisted leotard encrusted in rhinestone flames, to emulate the showgirl fashion featured in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. The leotard, however, was deemed [...] "too-vaginary" [...] {{by one of the}} workers at the label Azalea was signed to, ultimately leading to the worker being dismissed from the project and the leotard being scrapped altogether. Azalea's final wardrobe consisted of creations by Christian Louboutin, Jeremy Scott and the 2013 Spring/Summer Collection by Dolce & Gabanna. Her stylist, Alejandra Hernandez incorporated several pairs of Louboutins into the music video because of their significance to Azalea when she was a struggling rapper who achieved her first sense <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> after buying her first pair.|$|E
500|$|The {{walking and}} driving {{controls}} were criticized. Bramwell claimed that these modes felt [...] "like they've been attached {{with an old}} stick of glue that's about as adhesive as baby oil". Knutson agreed, though he praised the novelty of these diversions. He stated that [...] "the Tony Hawk series has always had exceptional controls" [...] and that Underground, overall, was no exception. Perry felt that the feature increased levels' replay value. Similarly, Famitsu reviewers noted that, although the game's fast pace makes it extremely challenging at times, the high difficulty provides a sense <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> when jumps and tricks are performed correctly. Williams found the GameCube version's controls mediocre, albeit manageable. Damon Brown from GameSpot stated that the mobile version's restrictive controls—many tricks require three button inputs—were that version's only caveat.|$|E

500|$|Critics also {{consider}} Steinbock important {{because of his}} artistic genius. Like Louis Lambert and Lucien Chardon in Illusions perdues, he is a brilliant man– just as Balzac considered himself to be. Before he is nurtured and directed by Bette, however, Steinbock's genius languishes under his own inertia and he attempts suicide. Later, when he leaves Bette's circle of influence, he fails again. Thus he demonstrates Balzac's conviction that genius alone is useless without determination. Bellos organizes Steinbock and Bette into a duality of weakness and strength; whereas the Polish artist is unable to direct his energies into productive work, Bette draws strength from her virginity and thus becomes powerful by denying the lust to which Steinbock falls prey. Steinbock's drive is further eroded by the praise he receives for his art, which gives him an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment.</b> One critic refers to the artist's downfall as [...] "vanity... spoiled by premature renown".|$|E
500|$|Glass Joe's debut was in {{the first}} Punch-Out!! game for the arcades in 1984. His role was to give young players a sense <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> which {{motivated}} them to spend more money to try and beat the more difficult opponents. Glass Joe later appeared in Punch-Out!! for the NES in 1987. While he did not appear in the SNES game's sequel, he opened a boxing school for potential fighters. Gabby Jay (the game's first opponent) attended this school and got his first and only win against Glass Joe. Glass Joe's most recent appearance was in Punch-Out!! for the Wii in 2009. He {{was one of the first}} characters revealed in pre-release material. The Wii Punch-Out!! has a mode called [...] "Title Defense" [...] which featured a more difficult version of Glass Joe among other opponents. This mode has Glass Joe wear a protective headgear due to a doctor's recommendation after an X-ray was done on his skull.|$|E
500|$|Other {{gameplay}} aspects received mixed reviews. Tyrrel {{praised the}} customization system for Max and the Magnum Opus, since the customization impacts the gameplay {{and makes the}} overall experience more rewarding; Kollar echoed this. Brown criticized the game for failing to offer much challenge or a sense <b>of</b> <b>accomplishment</b> to players. He called the health system a redundant addition in which resources, such as water and food, play an insignificant role and can be neglected by players. Brown also criticized the scrap-collecting system, writing that it frustrated most players and slowed the game's pace. However, Robinson wrote that those elements reflect the barbarian nature of the wasteland. He praised its world design (which he thought echoed the films), describing it as [...] "a world of twisted metal and sudden violence that's there to be survived rather than conquered". Bloodworth criticized the game's stronghold system, which he called repetitive. Brown criticized the game's lack of a climbing system, which hinders movement; this was echoed by Carter.|$|E
