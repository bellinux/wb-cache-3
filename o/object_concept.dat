They are context-sensitive constructions in working memory when activated. We hypothesized that man-made <b>object</b> <b>concepts</b> are more context-dependent than living things because man-made <b>object</b> <b>concepts</b> are constructed from the interaction among the object form, designer's intention, {{and the way in}} which the object was used. Results of a scenario-based categorization task support this hypothesis.

50|$|A symbol, in {{its basic}} sense, is a {{representation}} of a concept or quantity; i.e., an idea, <b>object,</b> <b>concept,</b> quality, etc. In more psychological and philosophical terms, all concepts are symbolic in nature, and representations for these concepts are simply token artifacts that are allegorical to (but do not directly codify) a symbolic meaning, or symbolism.|$|E
5000|$|A {{constructional}} {{system or}} a constitution {{system is a}} system of <b>objects</b> or <b>concepts</b> of a certain domain in which all <b>objects</b> or <b>concepts</b> of that domain can be logically constructed from a proper subset of those <b>objects</b> or <b>concepts,</b> called {{the basis of the}} system.|$|R

A common way miscategorization occurs is through an over-categorization of <b>concepts,</b> <b>objects</b> or entities, and then miscategorization based upon characters that virtually all things have in common.|$|R
40|$|Perirhinal cortex (PrC) {{has been}} implicated as a brain {{region in the}} medial {{temporal}} lobes (MTL) that critically contributes to familiarity-based recognition memory, a process that allows for recognition to occur independently of contextual recollection. Informed by neurophysiological research in non-human primates, fMRI, as well as behavioural work in humans, the current thesis research tests the novel hypothesis that PrC cortex functioning also underlies the ability to assess cumulative lifetime familiarity with <b>object</b> <b>concepts</b> that are characterized by a lifetime of experiences. In Chapter 2, a patient (NB) with a left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) lesion that included PrC {{as well as an}} amnesic patient (HC) with a bilateral lesion to the hippocampus were tested on their ability to make lifetime familiarity judgements for <b>object</b> <b>concepts</b> (i. e., concrete nouns). Patient NB made abnormal familiarity ratings for <b>objects</b> <b>concepts</b> relative to matched controls, while patient HC produced ratings that did not differ from control participants. In Chapter 3, I tested healthy young adults on a frequency judgement task and lifetime familiarity task while they underwent fMRI. A region in the left PrC tracked both the perceived frequency of recent laboratory exposure as well as perceived lifetime familiarity. Finally, in Chapter 4, I tested whether indeed lifetime familiarity judgements are based on conceptual processing by making use of an associative priming paradigm. Associatively-related primes increased the perceived familiarity of <b>object</b> <b>concepts</b> while also reducing the latency of these judgements. Overall, the results from all three empirical chapters provides evidence that warrants an extension of PrC functioning to include the cumulative assessment of lifetime familiarity with <b>object</b> <b>concepts...</b>|$|R

In that sense, there is not mental <b>object</b> (<b>concept)</b> “distinct” (that is, different in state of being) from the physical object, but only an apparent split between the two, which can then be brought together by proper compresence or participation of the consciousness in the object itself.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{approach}} to generic <b>object</b> <b>concepts</b> for problem solving method ontologies and knowledgebased systems. By using placeholders, whose main purpose is to define characteristics of the objects upon which the method acts without specifying a domain, method ontologies can become more reusable. The re-usability stems from the ability to merge such method ontologies more easily with fitting domains. The generic <b>object</b> <b>concepts</b> in the method are proposed {{to be used as}} a bridge to the domain ontology. The paper provides a comparison to similar methods in related studies...|$|R

50|$|Music for Objects is an {{extended}} play by Canadian electronic musician Michael Silver, known by his stage name as CFCF. The EP is a 24-minute set of eight compositions that {{are meant to}} showcase the emotion of everyday objects, a concept inspired by Wim Wenders' documentary film Notebook on Cities and Clothes (1989). Music for Objects has the same ambient feel as CFCF's previous EP Exercises (2012) but with a much more uplifting tone. Music for Objects was released in July 2013 in European territories by Dummy Records and in North America by Paper Bag Records, and garnered favorable reviews from professional reviewers upon its distribution. Some critics wrote it was enjoyable without knowing its <b>object</b> <b>concept,</b> while others praised how it represented the objects.|$|E

5000|$|The smart <b>object</b> <b>concept</b> was {{introduced}} by Marcelo Kallman and Daniel Thalmann as an object that can describe its own possible interactions. The main focus here is to model interactions of smart virtual objects with virtual humans, agents, in virtual worlds. The opposite approach to smart objects is 'plain' objects that do not provide this information. The additional information provided by this concept enables far more general interaction schemes, and can greatly simplify the planner of an artificial intelligence agent. In contrast to smart virtual objects used in virtual worlds, Lev Manovich focuses on physical space filled with electronic and visual information. Here, [...] "smart objects" [...] are described as [...] "objects connected to the Net; objects that can sense their users and display smart behaviour".|$|E
5000|$|The first {{implementation}} of the live distributed <b>object</b> <b>concept,</b> as defined in the ECOOP paper, was the Live Distributed Objects [...] platform developed by Krzysztof Ostrowski at Cornell University. The platform provided a set of visual, drag and drop tools for composing hierarchical documents resembling web pages, and containing XML-serialized live object references. Visual content such as chat windows, shared desktops, and various sorts of mashups could be composed by dragging and dropping components representing user interfaces and protocol instances onto a design form, and connecting them together. Since the moment of its creation, a number of extension {{have been developed to}} embed live distributed objects in Microsoft Office documents, and to support various types of hosted content such as Google Maps. As of March 2009, the platform is being actively developed by its creators.|$|E

A point scoring system is in place for editing and adding images to a page; 1000 points will allow one to edit pages without {{the approval of the}} wiki-moderators. For 5000 points one will be able to by-pass moderation when creating pages. Each brand has customised sections in their respective databases, ranging from videogames franchises, anime series, comics characters, and movie clichés. Each entry into the databases has its own forum, allowing users to post specifically about subjects without threads being lost in the vast vacuum of forum activity. Each wiki-database page can have trivia questions added to it by users. Moderators can highlight specific database pages that need attention by placing a bounty on them. The bounty points are added on top of the wiki points users gain just from editing. Pages that have bounties placed on are labelled with the changes that are needed. They range from filling in an otherwise empty page, better page formatting, improving upon stale content, changing subjective content and removing unnecessary character, <b>object,</b> <b>concept</b> and location associations.|$|E
50|$|The term live {{distributed}} {{object was}} first used informally {{in a series of}} presentations given in the fall of 2006 at an ICWS conference, STC conference, and at the MSR labs in Redmond, WA, and then formally defined in 2007, in an IEEE Internet Computing article. Originally, the term was used to refer to the types of dynamic, interactive Web content that is not hosted on servers in data centers, but rather stored on the end-user's client computers, and internally powered by instances of reliable multicast protocols. The word live expressed the fact that the displayed information is dynamic, interactive, and represents current, fresh, live content that reflects recent updates made by the users (as opposed to static, read-only, and archival content that has been pre-assembled). The word distributed expressed the fact that the information is not hosted, stored at a server in a data center, but rather, it is replicated among the end-user computers, and updated in a peer-to-peer fashion through a stream of multicast messages that may be produced directly by the end-users consuming the content; a more comprehensive discussion of the live <b>object</b> <b>concept</b> in the context of Web development can be found in Krzysztof Ostrowski's Ph.D. dissertation.|$|E
40|$|Piaget first {{observed}} {{and described the}} problems which young infants have in understanding the nature of objects forty years ago. Both his description and {{his analysis of the}} development of the <b>object</b> <b>concept</b> are still widely supported today. This thesis, while accepting the Piagetian description of the behaviours involved, suggests that Piaget's account of the underlying cognitive processes is no longer tenable. Alternative theories of <b>object</b> <b>concept</b> development which have been put forward in recent years are also examined and rejected. An identity theory of <b>object</b> <b>concept</b> development is proposed and a series of six interlinked experiments presented in an attempt to provide support for this theory. On the basis of these and the many other experiments reported in the literature, it is suggested that an identity theory alone can adequately cover the variety of appropriate and inappropriate object-related behaviours seen {{in the first two years}} of life...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a formal theory for describing actions in terminological knowledge bases, {{closely related to}} description logics. It deals in particular {{with the problem of}} adapting the subsumption/specialization relations and the definition of inheritance from the well-formulated notions for static <b>object</b> <b>concepts</b> to dynamic action concepts. The description of action concepts integrates a formal notation of preconditions and effects similar to STRIPS planning systems. The approach suggested here anchors action descriptions in the object-concept part of the taxonomy. Object-concepts, their attributes, and relations are integrated as parameters in action descriptions, and are used in precondition and effect formulae, which specify changes in the object-concept part of the taxonomy. The definition of action concepts and their extensional semantics is based on the view of actions as transformers between world states, where preconditions and effects describe constraints on world states. This view allows a definition of inheritance and the subsumption/specialization relation for action concepts in parallel to the respective definitions for <b>object</b> <b>concepts.</b> ...|$|R
