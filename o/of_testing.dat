5|$|After the British Grand Prix on 23 April, all teams {{conducted}} in-season {{testing at}} the Circuit de Catalunya on 25–28 April {{to prepare for}} the upcoming Spanish Grand Prix. Jos Verstappen was fastest on the first day <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> despite spinning into the gravel early in the session, ahead of McLaren test driver Olivier Panis. Michael Schumacher was quickest on the second day. Michael Schumacher remained the fastest driver on the third day <b>of</b> <b>testing.</b> The session was disrupted because several drivers stopped on the circuit with problems with their cars. On the final day, (which was held in wet weather conditions in the morning and during the end of the session) Michael Schumacher stayed the quickest driver on the final day.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, of finding whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness. The {{same is true for}} detecting whether the pattern graph is an induced subgraph of the larger graph, or whether it has a graph homomorphism to the larger graph. For the same reason, the problem <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> whether a graph of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter tractable.|$|E
5|$|Because {{different}} embeddings {{may lead}} to different dual graphs, testing whether one graph is a dual of another (without already knowing their embeddings) is a nontrivial algorithmic problem. For biconnected graphs, it can be solved in polynomial time by using the SPQR trees of the graphs to construct a canonical form for the equivalence relation of having a shared mutual dual. For instance, the two red graphs in the illustration are equivalent according to this relation. However, for planar graphs that are not biconnected, this relation is not an equivalence relation and the problem <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> mutual duality is NP-complete.|$|E

5|$|Following the French Grand Prix on 2 July, six teams {{conducted}} testing {{sessions at}} the Silverstone Circuit between 4–6 July {{to prepare for}} the Austrian Grand Prix at the A1-Ring.

Ferrari and McLaren opted to test at the Mugello Circuit where both teams concentrated their efforts on aerodynamic and suspension set-ups between 4–7 July. Ferrari spent one further day performing shakedown runs of their cars at the Fiorano Circuit with their test driver Luca Badoer. Williams and BAR tested at the Autódromo do Estoril between 5–7 July where testing consisted of tyre, engine, aerodynamic and set-up optimisation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for embedding <b>of</b> <b>test</b> concepts into high-level synthesis. Symbolic test points declared by a test concept specification are mapped on physical registers. This {{is done by}} an assignment <b>of</b> <b>test</b> points to symbolic registers and by a usual register binding tool. The experiments show that this way of integration does not result in larger designs. 1 Introduction The use <b>of</b> built-in self <b>test</b> methods or partial scan paths requires the selection <b>of</b> <b>test</b> points. The selection <b>of</b> <b>test</b> points is a problem which is mostly considered after {{the design of the}} RT-structure.

5|$|Following the {{awarding}} of the contract, a preliminary design review {{was carried out in}} September 1972, followed by a critical design review in September 1976 after which the engine's design was set and construction of the first set of flight-capable engines began. Final review of all the Space Shuttle's components, including the engines, was conducted in 1979. The design reviews operated in parallel with several test milestones, initial tests consisting of individual engine components which identified shortcomings with various areas of the design, including the HPFTP, HPOTP, valves, nozzle and fuel preburners. The individual engine component tests were followed by the first test of a complete engine (0002) on March 16, 1977. NASA specified that, prior to the Shuttle's first flight, the engines must have undergone at least 65,000 seconds <b>of</b> <b>testing,</b> a milestone that was reached on March 23, 1980, with the engine having undergone 110,253 seconds <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> by the time of STS-1 both on test stands at Stennis Space Center and installed on the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA). The first set of engines (2005, 2006 and 2007) were delivered to Kennedy Space Center in 1979 and installed on , before being removed in 1980 for further testing and reinstalled on the orbiter. The engines, which were of the first manned orbital flight (FMOF) configuration and certified for operation at 100% rated power level (RPL), were operated in a twenty-second flight readiness firing on February 20, 1981, and, after inspection, declared ready for flight.|$|E

These tests were intended to assist in debugging the engine for the Bell XP-77 lightweight fighter and Edo XOSE floatplane, but the V-770 remained troublesome, and after two years <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> the XSO2U was returned to the Navy. Having no further use for the aircraft, the XSO2U-1 was removed from the Navy's rolls on 6 July 1944, being subsequently scrapped.|$|E

Common formulations of the clique problem include finding a maximum clique (a clique with the largest possible number of vertices), finding a maximum weight clique in a weighted graph, listing all maximal cliques (cliques that cannot be enlarged), and solving the decision problem <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> whether a graph contains a clique larger than a given size.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{symptoms}} are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated decreased blood volume. Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, hemolysis develops, resulting in reduced urine output, hemoglobin {{in the urine}} or outright absence of urine formation, and anemia. Medical laboratory tests consist <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> {{for the presence of}} increasing bilirubin and free hemoglobin, and falling haptoglobins. Hemolysis may lead to numerous complications including acute renal failure, shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These complications can cause significant morbidity with fatalities having been reported.|$|E

30|$|To {{compare the}} results <b>of</b> several <b>testing</b> fuzzy {{hypotheses}} {{based on the}} proposed approach, five different tests are considered in this example by changing the fuzzy hypotheses (see Fig. 4).

Comparing the result <b>of</b> <b>test</b> 1 with the result <b>of</b> <b>test</b> 2 shows {{the sensitivity of the}} proposed approach to the location of the alternative fuzzy hypothesis (compare the first graph with the second one in Fig. 4). Also, comparing the result <b>of</b> <b>test</b> 1 with the result <b>of</b> <b>test</b> 3 shows the sensitivity of the proposed approach to the fuzziness of H̃_ 1. Instead of the current fuzzy p-value methods, the results <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> 1 – 5 show that the proposed decision rule in this paper is a function of both fuzzy hypotheses H̃_ 0 and H̃_ 1 (see the first advantage from Subsection “Advantages of the Proposed Method”).|$|R
