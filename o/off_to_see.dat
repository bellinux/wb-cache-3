One, a field hand turned domestic named Minnah, whom Stowe has {{tried in vain to}} teach how to do household chores, is so forthright in her speech that Stowe writes, [...] "Democracy never assumes a more rampant form than in some of these old negresses, who would say their screed to the king on his throne if they died for it the next minute. Accordingly, Minnah's back was marked and scored with the tyrant's answers to free speech." [...] Minnah eventually returns happily to the fields. Another, Judy, is complacent and enjoys taking mornings and afternoons <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> to her husband. Stowe attributes their work ethic to poor training and [...] "the negligent habits inducted by slavery"; the truly talented and hard-working black laborers had moved on from homesteads to industry, able to demand their own price for their labors.|$|E

2500|$|The Zenit 12-XP With its Helios f2/58mm {{lens and}} cloth shutter was widely sold by US Eastern camera stores. Many with the Zenit name covered with their [...] "USA" [...] brand. This Metallic re-badge was {{easy enough to}} gently pry <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the true name Zenit. The TTL meter was fairly {{accurate}} and took decent shots. The 1981 price was $110 usa. The Russians believed that 58mm more closely matched the Human normal range than the standard 50mm used worldwide as a normal lens. It also had a T setting for timed exposures making it {{a good choice for}} yearly fireworks displays.

2500|$|His {{father was}} a coal miner and worked summers as a farmer, and the family {{remained}} poor. [...] Fairless later recalled that his father repeatedly said {{the only way to}} survive in the world was to work and work very hard.

2500|$|Nixon {{later told}} Soap Opera Digest that she always planned on pairing Dimitri with Erica, but held <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if they worked well together. [...] "Long before their {{relationship}} started, viewers {{were saying that}} Erica and Dimitri belong together," [...] she said. [...] "They have great chemistry and are very alike, kindred spirits." [...] Nixon wrote {{the beginning of the}} couple's story as a love-hate relationship where they both disliked each other. The dislike became an attraction that resulted in a [...] "tug-of-war" [...] type of story. [...] "We can't even define it as a romance," [...] Nader said. [...] "It has to be defined as a positioning of players. Dimitri is very well aware that he has to dance a little dance with her." [...] Nixon made the relationship different from Erica's other ones. In previous romances, she acted as the aggressor. In this one, Nixon positioned Dimitri as the one who pursued Erica and made the first sexual overtures. She also used the Erica and Dimitri relationship as a way of developing a new, more sexual side of Dimitri. Nader said, [...] "There was a part of Dimitri that he never explored before because he married so young. A part of him shut down. But now, there is a whole other aspect of his sexual nature that has been awakened and Erica is about that. [...] a lot more fire with her." ...|$|E
