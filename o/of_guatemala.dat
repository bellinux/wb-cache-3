5|$|Alfhems {{success in}} evading the {{quarantine}} led to Washington escalating its intimidation <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala</b> through its navy. On 24 May, the U.S. launched Operation HARDROCK BAKER, a naval blockade <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala.</b> Ships and submarines patrolled the Guatemalan coasts, and all approaching ships were stopped and searched; these included ships from Britain and France, violating international law. However Britain and France did not protest very strongly, hoping that in return the U.S. would {{not interfere with}} their efforts to subdue rebellious colonies in the Middle East. The intimidation was not solely naval; on 26 May one of Castillo Armas' planes flew over the capital, dropping leaflets that exhorted people to struggle against communism and support Castillo Armas.|$|E

5|$|Carlos Castillo Armas (November 4, 1914 – July 26, 1957) was a Guatemalan {{military}} officer and politician. After taking {{power in a}} coup d'état, he served as the President <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala</b> from 1954 to 1957. A member of the right-wing National Liberation Movement (MLN) party, his authoritarian government was closely allied to the United States.|$|E

5|$|Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas {{arrived in}} the colony <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala</b> in 1537 and {{immediately}} campaigned to replace violent military conquest with peaceful missionary work. Las Casas offered to achieve the conquest of the Land of War through the preaching of the Catholic faith. It was the Dominicans who promoted {{the use of the}} name Verapaz instead of the Land of War. Because {{of the fact that the}} land had not been possible to conquer by military means, the governor <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala,</b> Alonso de Maldonado, agreed to sign a contract promising he would not establish any new encomiendas in the area should Las Casas' strategy succeed. Las Casas and a group of Dominican friars established themselves in Rabinal, Sacapulas and Cobán, and managed to convert several native chiefs using a strategy of teaching Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area.|$|E

5|$|Hattie {{maintained}} {{much of its}} intensity as {{it continued}} toward the coast of British Honduras. After moving through several small islands offshore, the hurricane made landfall a short distance south of Belize City on October 31, with an eyewall of about 25 miles (40 km) in diameter. Based on a post-season analysis, {{it was determined that}} Hattie had weakened to winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) before moving ashore. The hurricane deteriorated rapidly over land, dissipating on November 1 as it moved into the mountains <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala.</b> During its dissipation, Tropical Storm Simone was developing off the Pacific coast <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala.</b> There was speculation that Hattie contributed to the development of Simone, and later Tropical Storm Inga after the remnants of Simone merged with nearby disturbed weather.|$|E

5|$|In 1695 {{the colonial}} {{authorities}} decided to act upon {{a plan to}} connect the province <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala</b> with Yucatán, and a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtatán, Cobán and Ocosingo. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán. Following the same route used in 1686, they managed {{on the way to}} recruit 200indigenous Maya warriors from Santa Eulalia, San Juan Solomá and San Mateo. On 28 February 1695, all three groups left their respective bases of operations to conquer the Lacandon. The San Mateo group headed northeast into the Lacandon Jungle, and joined up with Jacinto de Barrios Leal, president of the Royal Audiencia <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala.</b>|$|E

5|$|Spanish {{jurisdiction}} over the province of Soconusco was subject to frequent changes. Immediately after the conquest, it was held in encomienda first by Hernán Cortés, then by Jorge de Alvarado. By 1530, the Audiencia Real of Mexico had {{jurisdiction over}} the province of Soconsusco, which was now held in encomienda by the Spanish Crown. It was governed by colonial officers appointed in Mexico. In 1556, Soconusco passed into {{the jurisdiction of the}} Audiencia Real <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala,</b> with independent governors appointed by the Crown. From 1564–69, Soconusco was passed back into the jurisdiction of Mexico, before once again becoming an independent province administered by the Audiencia Real <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala,</b> where it remained until the late 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{weaponry}} {{and tactics}} differed greatly {{from that of}} the indigenous peoples <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala.</b> This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets and cannon), war dogs and war horses. Among Mesoamerican peoples the capture of prisoners was a priority, while to the Spanish such taking of prisoners was a hindrance to outright victory. The inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala,</b> for all their sophistication, lacked key elements of Old World technology, {{such as the use of}} iron and steel and functional wheels. The use of steel swords was perhaps the greatest technological advantage held by the Spanish, although the deployment of cavalry helped them to rout indigenous armies on occasion. The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the quilted cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour. The conquistadors applied a more effective military organisation and strategic awareness than their opponents, allowing them to deploy troops and supplies in a way that increased the Spanish advantage.|$|E

5|$|The Petén Basin covers an {{area that}} is now part of Guatemala; in colonial times it {{originally}} fell {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Governor of Yucatán, before being transferred to the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala</b> in 1703. The Itza kingdom centred upon Lake Petén Itzá had been visited by Hernán Cortés on his march to Honduras in 1525.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} Petén {{was the last}} stage of the conquest <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala,</b> a {{prolonged}} conflict during the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. A wide lowland plain covered with dense rainforest, Petén contains a central drainage basin {{with a series of}} lakes and areas of savannah. It is crossed by several ranges of low karstic hills and rises to the south as it nears the Guatemalan Highlands. The conquest of Petén, a region now incorporated into the modern republic <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala,</b> climaxed in 1697 with the capture of Nojpetén, the island capital of the Itza kingdom, by Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to European colonisers.|$|E
5|$|The US-based United Fruit Company (UFC) {{was one of}} {{many foreign}} {{companies}} that acquired large tracts of both state land and indigenous land. Manuel Estrada Cabrera, who was president <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala</b> from 1898 to 1920, permitted limited unionization in rural Guatemala, but also made further concessions to the UFC. In 1922, the Communist Party <b>of</b> <b>Guatemala</b> was created, and became a significant influence among urban laborers; however, it had little reach among the rural and Indian populations. In 1929, the Great Depression led to the collapse of the economy and a rise in unemployment, leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Fearing the possibility of a revolution, the landed elite lent their support to Jorge Ubico y Castañeda, who had built a reputation for ruthlessness and efficiency as a provincial governor. Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate.|$|E
