60|$|The {{character}} of the <b>original</b> <b>measures</b> proposed about time in the National Legislature {{for the treatment of}} the (as yet) Congressionally excluded South, and the spirit in which those measures were advocated--these are circumstances which it is fairly supposable would have deeply influenced the thoughts, whether spoken or withheld, of a Southerner placed in the position of Lee before the Reconstruction Committee.|$|E
60|$|But {{to return}} from this digression: {{with regard to the}} other {{branches}} of the executive government, which relate rather to <b>original</b> <b>measures</b> than to administering the law, it may be observed that the power exercised in conducting them is distinguished by almost imperceptible shades from the legislative, and that all such as admit of open discussion and of the delay attendant on public deliberations are properly the province of the representative assembly. If this observation be duly attended to, it will appear that this part of the executive power will be extremely circumscribed, will be stripped almost entirely of a deliberative capacity, and will be reduced to a mere hand or instrument. As a Republican government would leave this power to a select body destitute of the means of corruption, and whom the people, continually contributing, could at all times bring to account or dismiss, will it not necessarily ensue that a body so selected and supported would perform their simple functions with greater efficacy and fidelity than the complicated concerns of royalty can be expected to meet with in the councils of princes; of men who from their wealth and interest have forced themselves into trust; and of statesmen, whose constant object is to exalt themselves by laying pitfalls for their colleagues and for their country.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes the {{stochastic}} {{tabu search}} (STS) {{for improving the}} measurement scheme for power system state estimation. If the <b>original</b> <b>measured</b> scheme is not observable, the additional measurements with minimum number of measurements are added into the system by STS {{so that there is}} no critical measurement pair. The random bit flipping and bit exchanging perturbations are used for generating the neighborhood solutions in STS. The Pδ observable concept is used to determine the network observability. Test results of 10 bus, IEEE 14 and 30 bus systems are shown that STS can improve the <b>original</b> <b>measured</b> scheme to be observable without critical measurement pair. Moreover, the results of STS are superior to deterministic tabu search (DTS) in terms of the best solution hit...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we apply}} {{independent}} component analysis (ICA) to electrocardiographic (ECG) signals for improved detection of abnormal {{conditions in the}} heart. Unsupervised ICA neural networks can demix the components of measured ECG signals. Such components may correspond to individual heart functions, either normal or abnormal. ICA neural networks {{have the potential to}} make abnormal components more apparent, even when they are masked by normal components in the <b>original</b> <b>measured</b> signals. This is particularly important for diagnosis well in advance of the actual onset of heart attack, in which abnormalities in the <b>original</b> <b>measured</b> ECG signals may be difficult to detect. This is the first known work that applies ICA to EGC signals beyond noise extraction, to the detection of abnormal heart function...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of regularity within morphological paradigms has been formerly addressed within approaches {{falling in the}} scope of Canonical Typology (Corbett 2003). The aim {{of this paper is}} to provide a means for assessing the notion of morphological canonicity through <b>original</b> <b>measures</b> developed within our new morphological framework PARSLI. In particular, we introduce <b>original</b> <b>measures</b> for non-canonical phenomena such as heteroclisis, deponency, defectiveness and overabundance. We introduce PARSLI a new model for inflectional morphology using an inferential-realisational approach (Matthews 1974; Zwicky 1985; Anderson 1992). Our model precisely provides a formal representation of the lexicon/grammar interface. It relies on a formal definition of a lexical entry and a complete formal apparatus for computing all relevant form realisation rules for each lexeme, including stem formation rules. Realisation rules themselves may be expressed through any suitable realisation-based formalism (e. g. PFM or Network Morphology). We introduce several formal innovations such as inflection zones, that constitute partitions of given inflection classes. They are in particular used in modelling heteroclisis...|$|E
