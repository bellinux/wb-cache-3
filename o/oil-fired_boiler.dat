25|$|Electrical {{immersion}} heaters may heat water immediately {{adjacent to the}} heating element high enough to promote the formation of scale, commonly calcium carbonate, in hard water areas. This accumulates on the element, and over time, as the element expands and contracts through its heating cycle, the scale cracks off and drops {{to the bottom of}} the tank, progressively filling up the tank. This reduces the tank's capacity and, where the immersion heater is secondary to the heating of the water by a coil fed from a gas or <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler,</b> can reduce the efficiency of the primary heating source by covering that other coil and in turn reducing its efficiency. Regular flushing-out of accumulated sediment can reduce this problem.|$|E
25|$|The National Trust has {{invested}} £600,000 in a marine source heat pump to provide heating for the house. At 300 kilowatts, the pump {{is the biggest}} in Britain. Its <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler</b> made the mansion the most polluting and biggest oil consumer of the National Trust's properties; the renovation is expected to save around £40,000 a year in operating costs. Plas Newydd {{is one of five}} properties in a pilot experiment; if they succeed, the National Trust will invest in 43 more renewable energy plans. The pilot programme includes: biomass in Croft Castle in Herefordshire, a woodchip boiler in Ickworth in Suffolk, and hydroelectric projects in Hafod y Porth near Craflwyn in Snowdonia, and at Stickle Ghyll in the Lake District.|$|E
40|$|Marstal's {{district}} heating system is supplied with heat from conventional <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers.</b> To reduce carbon dioxide emissions, biomass was considered. However, due to insufficient biomass resource {{on the island}} of AEro other possibilities were investigated. Based on the experience from other large Danish solar heating facilities, the possibility of building a large thermal solar heating plant to supplement the <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> was investigated using a simulation programme. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{question}} of whether the new ships should be powered entirely by <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> was less controversial. The design staff was generally in agreement with the standard practice of using coal-fired boilers for two-thirds of the power plant, with the remainder being <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers.</b> Coal-fired boilers were preferred because the coal, stored in the sides of the ship, provided additional protection, particularly for the battlecruisers, which carried less armor than their battleship counterparts. The finalized design was approved on 23 May 1914.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Stoddert <b>oil-fired,</b> water-tube <b>boiler</b> {{was replaced}} in 2000 {{with a new}} Babcock & Wilcox <b>oil-fired</b> water-tube <b>boiler</b> of similar configuration.|$|R
500|$|Under the Trust's {{ownership}} the sawmill {{has been}} renovated and {{converted into a}} combined learning, educational and rentable function space for businesses {{and members of the}} public. It is most often used by National Trust staff and volunteers to educate visiting school groups. The building now houses the biomass boiler for the main house, which saves 141 tonnes of CO2 a year over the old <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler.</b> Another section of the former wood shed was used as a new roost site for bat species, creating a [...] "bat palace". The centre was opened in May 2009 by Dame Jenny Abramsky, Chair of the Heritage Lottery Fund, who partially funded the works.|$|E

50|$|A 168 MWe <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler</b> {{was added}} in 1966 {{to utilize the}} turbine-generator during periods when the reactor was not {{producing}} power.|$|E
50|$|The {{second was}} the {{adoption}} of gas turbines in place of <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> for all other navy ships. These powered engines directly and needed no boilers.|$|R
50|$|The {{ships were}} modernised in the 1930s with <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> {{replacing}} the old coal-fired boilers, removal of underwater torpedo equipment, new anti-aircraft guns and fire control equipment.|$|R
2500|$|In 1912, Camosun was {{converted}} from coal-fired to <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers,</b> {{the high cost}} of which was offset by the ease and cleanliness of refueling compared to the use of coal bunkers.|$|R
5000|$|In 1951 Sentinel and Metro-Cammell built ten 3-car {{steam railcar}} units for the Egyptian National Railways. The units were articulated, with an <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler</b> {{supplying}} steam to two 6-cylinder steam motors. Withdrawn from service in 1962, [...] one unit is under restoration at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre.|$|E
50|$|The Lune Valley boiler {{was a small}} <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler,</b> used by the Lune Valley Engineering Co. of Lancaster, England for steam {{launches}} {{and small}} steamboats. Each steam generator tube consisted of three turns, giving a greater heating surface {{for the number of}} pipe joints to be made. These coils were still arranged in tiers.|$|E
50|$|The Serpollet Tricycle {{was one of}} {{the first}} industrially {{manufactured}} motor vehicles; it was designed by Léon Serpollet, and first presented in 1886. The tricycle possessed an <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler</b> and a single-cylinder engine with poppet valves and crank cases. The steam tricycle of 1899 produced about 5 HP with its 4 cylinders. It achieved a maximum speed of about 25 km/h (16 mph).|$|E
50|$|Founded before 1910, {{the yard}} had its {{headquarters}} at 18-20 Summit Street. By 1920, {{the yard was}} known for its construction and repair of <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers,</b> diesel engines, and refrigeration units.|$|R

50|$|Musa had turbo-electric {{transmission}} {{built by}} British Thomson-Houston of Rugby, Warwickshire. Her <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> supplied steam to a turbo generator that fed current to a propulsion motor on her single propeller shaft.|$|R
50|$|Twin screws {{are driven}} by surface-condensing {{direct-drive}} compound engines which were supplied with steam by a coal-fired Scotch boiler with two furnaces. A similar but <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler</b> replaced the original boiler in 1963. In 1980 this was also removed and the present two locally made small modern package boilers were installed. These new boilers produce less steam than the original ones.|$|E
50|$|In late 2003, {{plans to}} install a 40 MW gas turbine at the station were finally fulfilled, after they were put off because of then owner Enron's bankruptcy. The gas turbine {{installation}} was completed in 2004, and it replaced an <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler</b> at the station, resulting in reduced emissions from the station. However, the station has retained the flexibility to fire oil as a backup to coal and gas.|$|E

The other spiral C can be used for a e.g. <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler</b> or a wood burner. At D the hot water gets out and domestic cold water is sent back at the bottom at E.|$|E
5|$|During Florida and Utahs {{reconstruction}} in 1925–1927, their coal-fired boilers {{were replaced}} with four White-Forster <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers.</b> The {{reduction in the}} number of boilers allowed their twin funnels to be trunked into one single larger funnel.|$|R
50|$|Apart from Chasseur, {{which still}} used coal, {{they were the}} first French Navy ships to be fitted with <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers.</b> In trials they {{exceeded}} their designed power by a wide margin, achieving speeds of up to 31 kn.|$|R
50|$|The second kind is a fuel/air {{explosion}} in the furnace, which would more properly be termed a firebox explosion. Firebox explosions in solid-fuel-fired boilers are rare, but firebox explosions in gas or <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> are still a potential hazard.|$|R
5000|$|The 'Baths' as {{they are}} more {{commonly}} known have survived through mix fortunes over their many years of existence. Having at one point closed and lay almost derelict but were reopened, a similar fate nearly closed the Baths in the 1970s known as [...] "the day the roof fell in". The huge Victorian roof collapsed at the shallow {{end of the pool}} and with the Cochrane <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler</b> rarely working, the whole place was trading at a loss and the membership rapidly dwindling.|$|E
50|$|Improvements to the {{facility}} were carried out in 1950, {{at a cost of}} £6,800. These included an extension to the laundry, the addition of verandas to two of the villas and the erection of a designated patients' cafeteria. A television set was installed in May 1953, courtesy of Sir John Stirling-Maxwell, and a new <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler</b> was implemented in the late 1960s. The institution was upgraded and modernised circa 1975. In 1989, a £9,700 minibus was presented to the hospital by the Parks and Recreation Charities Club.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, {{the company}} {{acquired}} Ronuk Ltd, {{a manufacturer of}} wax polishes and wood stains based in Portslade, Brighton {{and with it the}} Ronseal brand name. The group also set up Redfyre as a marketing company for coal-burning grates which were made in its foundry. Changes, in particular the Clean Air Act saw the company move into light fabrications and oil-fired central heating equipment, however, the <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler</b> market collapsed in autumn 1973 with the increase in prices. In 1972 the group was taken over by industrial holding company Central & Sherwood.|$|E
5000|$|The Thomas Willett was a fireboat {{operated}} by the FDNY. [...] She was launched in 1908 and retired in 1951. She was built as a steam-engine powered vessel with coal-fired boilers. She was converted to <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> in 1926.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, {{the cathedral}} parish of our Lady {{completed}} a {{restoration of the}} church interior which removed many decades of accumulated soot from coal-fired and <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> to return the original brilliance and luster of the mosaic works of art.|$|R
50|$|Paducah was {{modified}} {{in the early}} 1930s to run on <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers.</b> The triple expansion engines were installed, with boilers fore and aft. Additional modifications included hammock berthing on a new boat deck, and a sheltered main deck between the quarterdeck and the pilot house.|$|R
50|$|The Monarch was {{designed}} and built by Brian Waters, who was a key volunteer in finally restoring the paddle steamer Kingswear Castle. It was a dream of his to construct his own paddle steamer from scratch. Construction was originally started in 1984, but it took him almost twenty years before she was finally finished, entering commercial service in 2003. She {{is powered by a}} 100-year-old compound steam engine, fed by an <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler,</b> which was originally used as a tar pump at Caerphilly gas works. This gives an operating speed of up to 6 knots.|$|E
50|$|Despite being a {{very young}} class, some of the North British JA class members {{were among the first}} of the J types to be {{withdrawn}}. The first of the class to be withdrawn, JA 1279, was withdrawn in 1964 and sent to Hillside Workshops minus at least one driving wheelset, taken to repair JA 1275 after it suffered an axle fracture while passing through Mercer that year. The rest of the locomotive then became a source of spares for the J and Hillside JA class locomotives in the South Island, with the <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler</b> being converted to coal-firing before being fitted to Greymouth-based J 1212 during a C-grade overhaul.|$|E
5000|$|Older European cars used {{high voltage}} (or steam - {{supplied}} by steam locomotive (some diesels and electrics also had steam boilers fitted), {{there were also}} steam generator cars in use and some cars were fitted with coal- or <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boiler)</b> only for heating, while light, fans and other low-current supply (e.g. shaver sockets in bathrooms) power was provided by axle-driven generator. Today, with the developments in solid state electronics (thyristors and IGBTs), most cars have switching power supplies which take any RIC voltage (1.0 - 3.0 kV DC or /50 Hz) and can supply all the needed lower voltages. Low voltages differ depending on manufacturers, but typical values are: ...|$|E
5000|$|All {{ships were}} {{upgraded}} to <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> in the 1930s (In Gustaf V and Drottning Victoria it was, however, for strategic reasons {{decided to keep}} the ability to burn coal to secure their ability to operate on alternative fuel if the Swedish oil supply was cut off) ...|$|R
5000|$|The 001A is a {{conventionally}} powered ski jump carrier with {{a displacement}} of around 70,000 tonnes. It {{is likely to}} be powered by <b>oil-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> and steam turbines, though previously there has been speculation that it could be gas-turbine propelled. [...] There are some evident differences from the Soviet built Liaoning.|$|R
