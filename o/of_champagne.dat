5|$|The Carolingian reign saw {{periods of}} {{prosperity}} for the Champagne region beginning with Charlemagne's encouragement {{for the area}} to start planting vines and continuing with the coronation of his son Louis the Pious at Reims. The tradition of crowning kings at Reims contributed to {{the reputation of the}} wines that came from this area. The Counts <b>of</b> <b>Champagne</b> ruled the area as an independent county from 950 to 1316. In 1314, the last Count <b>of</b> <b>Champagne</b> assumed the throne as King Louis X of France and the region became part of the Crown territories.|$|E
5|$|Alice's second husband, Bohemond, {{was the son}} of Bohemond IV and {{his first}} wife, Plaisance Embriaco. He only succeeded his father in Antioch and Tripoli in 1233, after his {{marriage}} with Alice was annulled. Alice's young third husband, Ralph of Nesle, came to the Holy Land during the crusade of Theobald IV <b>of</b> <b>Champagne</b> in September 1239.|$|E
5|$|Before his {{departure}} for the Holy Land, Henry <b>of</b> <b>Champagne</b> had bequeathed the Counties <b>of</b> <b>Champagne</b> and Brie to his brother, Theobald, should he die without issue. Although Alice {{and her younger}} sister, Philippa, survived their father, Philip II of France invested their uncle, Theobald III, with Champagne and Brie in January 1198. Theobald III died on 24 May 1201, leaving Champagne and Brie to his posthumous son, Theobald IV, under the regency of his mother, Blanche of Navarre. However, Theobald IV's position was not secure as Alice and Philippa, both born while their father was count, could challenge a posthumous son's right to rule the counties.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, viticultural {{boundaries}} <b>of</b> <b>Champagne</b> were legally {{defined and}} split into five wine producing districts- The Aube, Côte des Blancs, Côte de Sézanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vallée de la Marne. This area covers 33,500 hectares (76,000 acres) of vineyards around 319 villages that {{are home to}} 5,000 growers who make their own wine and 14,000 growers who only sell grapes. The region is set to expand to include 359 villages in the near future.|$|E

5|$|When Henry I of Cyprus {{reached the}} age of {{majority}} on 3 May 1232, Alice abdicated from her regency of Cyprus, which she had retained despite having left Cyprus. She went to France to personally advance her claim for Champagne and Brie in 1233, but only one local nobleman, Renier II of Nogent, supported her. Theobald IV <b>of</b> <b>Champagne</b> later captured the fortress of Nogent and confiscated Renier's estates.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Theobald III, Count <b>of</b> <b>Champagne,</b> the {{leadership}} of the Crusade passed to Boniface of Montferrat, a friend of the Hohenstaufen Philip of Swabia. Both Boniface and Philip had married into the Byzantine Imperial family. In fact, Philip's brother-in-law, Alexios Angelos, son of the deposed and blinded Emperor Isaac II Angelos, had appeared in Europe seeking aid and had made contacts with the crusaders. Alexios offered to reunite the Byzantine church with Rome, pay the crusaders 200,000 silver marks, join the crusade and provide all the supplies they needed to get to Egypt. Innocent was aware of a plan to divert the Crusade to Constantinople and forbade any attack on the city, but the papal letter arrived after the fleets had left Zara.|$|E
5|$|At about 08:00, the 4th Cavalry Division's 2nd Lancers (10th Cavalry Brigade) and the 5th Cavalry Division's 29th Lancers (Deccan Horse) (14th Cavalry Brigade) entered Afulah. Here about 75 German and 200 Ottoman {{prisoners were}} {{captured}} at the railway station, along with ten locomotives and 50 railway trucks or wagons in the sidings. A hospital, an aerodrome with three undamaged aircraft, a large quantity of petrol, and large stocks <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> and hock were also captured. Armoured cars continued the pursuit, capturing 12 German lorries {{on the road}} to Beisan, while the railway running south and east from Afulah was cut; the line to the west had already been cut by the 13th Cavalry Brigade (5th Cavalry Division).|$|E

5|$|Fighting {{immediately}} {{broke out}} again along the Normandy borders, where Henry <b>of</b> <b>Champagne</b> and Robert captured {{the town of}} Neufmarché-sur-Epte. Louis's forces moved to attack Aquitaine. Stephen responded by placing Wallingford Castle, a key fortress loyal to Henry along the Thames Valley, under siege, possibly {{in an attempt to}} force a successful end to the English conflict while Henry was still fighting for his territories in France. Henry moved quickly in response, avoiding open battle with Louis in Aquitaine and stabilising the Norman border, pillaging the Vexin and then striking south into Anjou against Geoffrey, capturing one of his main castles. Louis fell ill and withdrew from the campaign, and Geoffrey was forced {{to come to terms with}} Henry.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey {{was the son}} of Hugh of Briel and Alice of Villehardouin, a {{daughter}} of the Prince of Achaea, Geoffrey I of Villehardouin. The family, which hailed from Briel-sur-Barse in the French province <b>of</b> <b>Champagne,</b> is variously named in the sources, e.g. Brieres or Prieres (Μπριέρες or Πριέρης in Greek), Bruières, Briers, Briel or Brielle. Geoffrey's father inherited the Barony of Karytaina sometime around 1222 from his brother, Renaud of Briel. The Barony was the third largest (after Akova and Patras) in the Principality of Achaea, counting 22 knights' fiefs and being responsible for keeping watch over the rebellious inhabitants of the mountainous Skorta area.|$|E
5|$|In 1203, Renoart of Nephin, Bohemond's vassal, married Isabel the heiress of Gibelcar, {{without his}} authorization. The High Court of Tripoli ordered the {{confiscation}} of Renoart's fiefs. However, {{he decided to}} resist and gained the support of Leo of Cilicia and Aimery, King of Cyprus and Jerusalem. Bohemond traveled to Acre in summer 1204 to meet Marie <b>of</b> <b>Champagne.</b> Her husband, Baldwin, had been recently crowned emperor in Constantinople. He did homage to her, acknowledging the suzerainty of the Latin Emperors over Antioch. Marie tried to mediate a reconciliation between Bohemond and Leo of Cilicia, but she died in August.|$|E

5|$|Long-running {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis VII continued during the 1160s, the French king slowly becoming more vigorous in opposing Henry's increasing power in Europe. In 1160 Louis strengthened his alliances in central France with the Count <b>of</b> <b>Champagne</b> and Odo II, the Duke of Burgundy. Three {{years later the}} new Count of Flanders, Philip, concerned about Henry's growing power, openly allied himself with the French king. Louis's wife Adèle {{gave birth to a}} male heir, Philip Augustus, in 1165, and Louis was more confident of his own position than for many years previously. As a result, relations between Henry and Louis deteriorated again in the mid-1160s.|$|E
5|$|On January 15, 1970, First Lady of the United States Pat Nixon christened Pan Am's first 747, at Dulles International Airport (later Washington Dulles International Airport) in the {{presence}} of Pan Am chairman Najeeb Halaby. Instead <b>of</b> <b>champagne,</b> red, white, and blue water was sprayed on the aircraft. The 747 entered service on January22, 1970, on Pan Am's New York–London route; the flight had been planned for the evening of January21, but engine overheating made the original aircraft unusable. Finding a substitute delayed the flight by more than six hours to the following day when Clipper Victor was used.|$|E
5|$|The {{worldwide}} {{demand for}} Champagne has been continuously increasing throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. A record in worldwide shipping <b>of</b> <b>Champagne</b> (including domestic French consumption) of 327 million bottles {{was set in}} 1999 in anticipation of end of millennium celebrations, and a new record was set in 2007 at 338.7 million bottles. Since the entire vineyard area authorized by the 1927 AOC regulations is now planted, various ways of expanding the production have been considered. The allowed yield was increased (to a maximum of 15,500kg per hectare during an experimental period from 2007 to 2011) {{and the possibility of}} revising the production region was investigated.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{influence}} on Champagne wine production was the centuries-old rivalry between {{the region and}} Burgundy. From the key market of Paris to the palace of Louis XIV of France at Versailles, proponents <b>of</b> <b>Champagne</b> and Burgundy would compete for dominance. For most of his life, Louis XIV would drink only Champagne wine {{with the support of}} his doctor Antoine d'Aquin who advocated the King drink Champagne with every meal for the benefit of his health. As the King aged and his ailments increased, competing doctors would propose alternative treatments with alternative wines, to soothe the King's ills. One of these doctors, Guy-Crescent Fagon conspired with the King's mistress to oust d'Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King's continuing ailments to Champagne and ordered that only Burgundy wine must be served at the royal table.|$|E
5|$|After Henry I's {{death in}} 1135, the {{succession}} was disputed as the king's only legitimate son, William, {{had died in}} 1120. The main contenders were the king's nephews, Stephen, Count of Boulogne and his elder brother Theobald II, Count <b>of</b> <b>Champagne,</b> and his surviving legitimate daughter, Matilda, usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, {{she returned to her}} father in England, who then secured her marriage to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after Henry I's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned, before Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was less patient: she secured the support of the king of Scotland, David I, her maternal uncle, and the support of her half-brother Robert, Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of HenryI, in 1138.|$|E
5|$|After the {{supporters}} of Henry III of England suppressed opposition from the English nobility in the Second Barons' War, Henry granted to his second son Edmund Crouchback the titles and possessions forfeited by attainder of the barons' leader, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, including the Earldom of Leicester, on 26 October 1265. Later grants included the first Earldom of Lancaster on 30 June 1267 and that of Earl Ferrers in 1301. Edmund was also Count <b>of</b> <b>Champagne</b> and Brie from 1276 by right of his wife. Henry IV of England would later use his descent from Edmund to legitimise his claim to the throne, even making the spurious claim that Edmund was the elder son of Henry but had been passed over as king because of his deformity.|$|E
