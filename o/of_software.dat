40|$|Software {{reliability}} models {{describe the}} failure behavior <b>of</b> the <b>software.</b> The models {{are used to}} evaluate the software quantitatively. They assess the reliability <b>of</b> the <b>software</b> by predicting faults or failures for a software. Reliability is one of important quality attributes <b>of</b> the <b>software</b> in which software end user is more interested rather than the software developer. Hence, the performance <b>of</b> a <b>software</b> can be improved by incorporating important quality attributes like reliability, maintainability and availability <b>of</b> the <b>software</b> along with performance attributes like response time and throughput. The paper discusses about the role played by important software reliability models in analyzing the failure prediction <b>of</b> the <b>software.</b> It also explores the strong relationship that exists between quality attributes and performance attributes. With some illustrations highlighting the necessity of in-depth understanding of the link that exists between reliability and performance <b>of</b> the <b>software,</b> the derived knowledge helps in improving the performance <b>of</b> the <b>software</b> sustainably {{over a period of time}} and manage the software more effectively...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: A {{growing number}} <b>of</b> open source <b>software</b> emerges in many {{segments}} <b>of</b> the <b>software</b> market. In addition, software products usually exhibit network externalities. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to study the impact <b>of</b> open source <b>software</b> on the quality choices <b>of</b> proprietary <b>software</b> vendors when the market presents positive network externalities. Design/methodology: To analyze how open source software affects the optimal quality <b>of</b> proprietary <b>software,</b> this paper constructs two vertical differentiation models: the basic model considers proprietary software monopolizing the market, and its extended one considers proprietary software competing with open source substitute. Findings: This paper mainly finds that the presence <b>of</b> open source <b>software</b> does not necessarily lead to the quality <b>of</b> proprietary <b>software</b> decreases (or increases). The network externalities and compatibility between open source and proprietary software may change the impact <b>of</b> open source <b>software</b> on the quality <b>of</b> proprietary <b>software</b> and may affect the quality choices <b>of</b> proprietary <b>software</b> vendors. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is to examine the effect <b>of</b> open source <b>software</b> on the quality choices for proprietary software vendors in software markets exhibiting positive network externalities. </p...|$|R
