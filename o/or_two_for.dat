5|$|From left {{to right}} across the {{standard}} form of periodic table, as metallic character decreases, nonmetals therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction {{in the numbers of}} nearest neighbours—three <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>for</b> the polyatomic nonmetals, through one for the diatomic nonmetals, to zero for the monatomic noble gases. A similar pattern occurs more generally, {{at the level of the}} entire periodic table, in comparing metals and nonmetals. There is a transition from metallic bonding among the metals on the left of the table through to covalent or Van der Waals (electrostatic) bonding among the nonmetals on the right of the table. Metallic bonding tends to involve close-packed centrosymmetric structures with a high number of nearest neighbours. Post-transition metals and metalloids, sandwiched between the true metals and the nonmetals, tend to have more complex structures with an intermediate number of nearest neighbours. Nonmetallic bonding, towards the right of the table, features open-packed directional (or disordered) structures with fewer or zero nearest neighbours. As noted, this steady reduction in the number of nearest neighbours, as metallic character decreases and nonmetallic character increases, is mirrored among the nonmetals, the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic, to diatomic, to monatomic.|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} {{technical}} challenges {{depending on the}} subject, what the photographer wants to highlight, or how many subjects are in the frame. Therefore, photographing a single person and, for instance, if the photographer wants to highlight {{only half of the}} subject's face, a single light source placed laterally, at a certain distance and angle to the subject, and possibly a blend, will be usually used. Experimenting with different light intensities is performed until the desired effect is achieved. For photographing two people or a static scene, two or even three sources of light (one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>for</b> contour, and a very low-intensity fill light) are usually used.|$|E

25|$|The muscular abdomen has six {{segments}} {{and has a}} thinner shell {{than the}} carapace. Each segment has a separate overlapping shell, which can be transparent. The first five segments each have a pair of appendages on the underside, which are shaped like paddles and is used for swimming forward. The appendices are called pleopods or swimmerets, {{and can be used}} for more purposes than just swimming. Some shrimp species use them for brooding eggs, others have gills on them for breathing, and the males in some species use the first pair <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>for</b> insemination. The sixth segment terminates in the telson flanked by two pairs of appendages called the uropods. The uropods allow the shrimp to swim backward, and function like rudders, steering the shrimp when it swims forward. Together, the telson and uropods form a splayed tail fan. If a shrimp is alarmed, it can flex its tail fan in a rapid movement. This results in a backward dart called the caridoid escape reaction (lobstering).|$|E

500|$|For {{the most}} part, the {{differences}} between one balkline game to another is defined by two measures: 1) the spacing of the balklines, and 2) the number of points that are allowed in each balk space before at least one ball must leave the region. Generally, balkline games, and their particular restrictions, are given numerical names indicating both of these characteristics; the first number indicated either inches or centimeters depending on the game, and the second, after a dot or a slash, indicates the count restriction in balk spaces, which is always either one <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> <b>For</b> example, in 18.2 balkline, {{one of the more}} prominent balkline games and of U.S. origin, the name indicates that balklines are drawn 18 inches distant from each rail, and only two counts are allowed (before the first short, we call [...] "entrée" [...] and for the second short [...] "dedans") in a balk space before a ball must leave (in 18.1, we call directly the first short [...] "dedans"). By contrast, in 71.2 balkline, of French invention, lines are drawn 71 centimeters distant from each rail, also with a two count restriction for balk spaces.|$|E
500|$|In August 1823, in {{an issue}} of The Album, he {{published}} an article saying that more attention should {{be paid to the}} time period of Shakespeare's plays, {{especially when it comes to}} costumes. [...] In the same year, a casual conversation led to one of Planché's more lasting effects on British theatre. He observed to Charles Kemble, the manager of Covent Garden, that [...] "while a thousand pounds were frequently lavished upon a Christmas pantomime or an Easter spectacle, the plays of Shakespeare were put upon the stage with makeshift scenery, and, at the best, a new dress <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>for</b> the principal characters". Kemble [...] "saw the possible advantage of correct appliances catching the taste of the town", and agreed to give Planché control of the costuming for the upcoming production of King John, if he would carry out the research, design the costumes and superintend the production. Planché had little experience in this area and sought the help of antiquaries such as Francis Douce and Sir Samuel Meyrick. The research involved sparked Planché's latent antiquarian interests; these came to occupy an increasing amount of his time later in life.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, the ninety-two-year-old Ornstein {{wrote his}} Seventh Piano Sonata. With this {{composition}} Ornstein became, {{by a couple}} of years, the oldest published composer ever to produce a substantial new work. In September 1990, at the age of ninety-four, Ornstein's final work, the Eighth Piano Sonata, was completed and given its world premiere. The names of the sonata's movements reflect not only the passage of a remarkable span of time, but an undimmed sense of humor and exploratory spirit: I. [...] "Life's Turmoil and a Few Bits of Satire" [...] / II. [...] "A Trip to the Attic—A Tear <b>or</b> <b>Two</b> <b>for</b> a Childhood Forever Gone" [...] (a. [...] "The Bugler" [...] / b. [...] "A Lament for a Lost Toy" [...] / c. [...] "A Half-Mutilated Cradle—Berceuse" [...] / d. [...] "First Carousel Ride and Sounds of a Hurdy-Gurdy") / III. [...] "Disciplines and Improvisations". Reviewing the work's New York debut, critic Anthony Tommasini wrote, [...] "Between the roaring craziness of the first and third movements, the middle movement is a suite of four short musical musings on childhood mementos discovered in an attic. Though completely incongruous, the shift in tone is audacious and the music disarming. The audience listened raptly, then erupted in applause." ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{the diary}} of Valentina Chebotareva, a woman who nursed with Olga during World War I, Olga's [...] "golden Mitya" [...] was Dmitri Chakh-Bagov, a wounded soldier she cared for {{when she was a}} Red Cross nurse. Chebotareva wrote that Olga's love for him was [...] "pure, naive, without hope" [...] and that she tried to avoid {{revealing}} her feelings to the other nurses. She talked to him regularly on the telephone, was depressed when he left the hospital, and jumped about exuberantly when she received a message from him. Dmitri Chakh-Bagov adored Olga and talked of killing Rasputin for her if she only gave the word, because it was the duty of an officer to protect the imperial family even against their will. However, he also reportedly showed other officers the letters Olga had written to him when he was drunk. Another young man, Volodia Volkomski, appeared to have affection for her as well. [...] "(He) always has a smile <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>for</b> her", wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on December 16, 1916.

500|$|On November10,2010, [...] "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] was {{performed}} {{live for the}} first time by Aldean with Clarkson on the 44th Country Music Association Awards. The performance triggered an overwhelming demand from radio stations across the country. As a result, Aldean’s label, Broken Bow Records, made the song available on PLAY MPE. Carson James, the label's Senior Vice President for Promotion responded, [...] "If there’s one thing I’ve learned in my years in the record business, it is always give radio what they want [...] Our entire promotion staff has spent all night fielding calls and returning texts about getting this song, so we decided it best to release it on Play MPE first thing this morning." [...] Myra Dehais of RED Company claimed that the song's rise at adult-radio stations was a result of the company's distribution, saying [...] "This is a proud moment for RED distribution, [...] In crossing a country song over to the adult and pop formats, we can face resistance, since (some) stations have only a slot <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>for</b> country music, in order to maintain sonic balance.
