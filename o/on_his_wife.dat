Meanwhile, the old witch's cottage had caught fire and she was badly burnt. By next day, both toad and witch had died, and {{it was found that}} the woman's burns exactly mirrored those of the toad.|$|E
5|$|As {{the senator}} {{discussed}} their finances, the telecast again showed Pat Nixon, fixedly watching her husband. Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt gaze {{was because she}} did not know exactly what he would say, and wanted to hear. Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and {{that he and his wife}} owned no stocks or bonds.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Stalin {{closed down}} {{independent}} artists' unions; former avant-garde artists had {{to adapt to}} the new climate or risk being officially criticised or even blacklisted. Lissitzky retained his reputation as the master of exhibition art and management into the late 1930s. His tuberculosis gradually reduced his physical abilities, and he was becoming more and more dependent <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> in actual completion of his work.|$|E

Disabled, he cannot {{believe that}} a {{beautiful}} woman like Susanna would be faithful to him.

Edwin is eliminated during a panther-hunting trip {{with the help of}} Susanna's faithful maid (Usha Uthup), butler (Harish Khanna) and the mute stableboy.|$|E
5|$|Once {{considered}} {{for the role of}} James Bond in the cinematic adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels, Lucan was known for his expensive tastes; he raced power boats and drove an Aston Martin. In 1963 he married Veronica Duncan, by whom he had three children. When the marriage collapsed late in 1972, he moved out of the family home at 46Lower Belgrave Street, in London's Belgravia, to a property nearby. A bitter custody battle ensued, which Lucan lost. He began to spy <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> and record their telephone conversations, apparently obsessed with regaining custody of the children. This fixation, combined with his gambling losses, had a dramatic effect on his life and personal finances.|$|E

5|$|When White {{took over}} as editor, Amazings {{circulation}} was about 38,500, only about 4% of which were subscribers (as opposed to newsstand sales). This was a very low ebb for subscriptions; Analog, by comparison, sold about 35% of its circulation through subscriptions. Cohen's wife mailed out the subscription copies from home, and Cohen had never tried to increase the subscriber base as this would have increased the burden <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife.</b> White worked hard to increase the circulation despite Cohen's lack of support, but met with limited success. One of his first changes was to reduce the typeface {{to increase the amount}} of fiction in the magazine. To pay for this he increased the price of both Fantastic and Amazing to 60 cents, but this had a strong negative effect on circulation, which fell about 10% from 1969 to 1970.|$|E
