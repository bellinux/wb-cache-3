25|$|During the 1970s and 1980s Grand Trunk Western would {{continue}} to improve its efficiency and embark on efforts to improve its <b>operating</b> <b>ratio.</b> It had consolidated some of its operations including dispatching in Pontiac, locomotive maintenance in Battle Creek and railcar maintenance in Port Huron. Its intercity passenger train operations would be handed over to Amtrak in 1971. Responsibility for GTW's commuter rail operation in Detroit was turned over in 1974 to the regional transportation authority SEMTA. GTW moved into the intermodal freight business by creating intermodal transfer yards in Chicago in 1975 and suburban Detroit, in 1978. The railroad's president at the time, John H. Burdakin, was also a proponent of the Automatic Car Identification (ACI) system. It was a means to identify the location of shipments and equipment with bar code labels {{on the sides of}} freight cars and locomotives. The labels were read by automatic scanners at various rail yards. When Conrail was formed in 1976 GTW sought to acquire some of its routes in Michigan. It gained 151 miles (243km) of trackage between Saginaw and Bay City as well as near Muskegon and Midland, Michigan. Several of GTW's cuts in its expenditures came from reductions in its workforce through changes it negotiated in union work rules. In 1978 it discontinued its Lake Michigan railcar ferry operations after consecutive years of financial losses over $1 million. By 1987 the company sold its headquarters building on Lafayette Avenue in Detroit and moved to the new office park complex Brewery Park. The complex was developed {{on the site of the}} former Stroh's Brewery near downtown Detroit. Locomotive performance was also enhanced with a rebuilding program of its EMD GP9s.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how nonprofit organizations respond to incentives {{to manage their}} publicly available financial information. Prior research identifies two <b>operating</b> <b>ratios</b> donors commonly use to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of nonprofits (i. e., the program service ratio, defined as the fraction of total expenses committed to advancing the charitable mission of the organization, and the fundraising ratio, defined as the ratio of fundraising expenses to donations revenue). Nonprofit managers {{have an incentive to}} over-report the expenses classified as program services and under-report the expenses classified as administrative and fundraising in order to improve these ratios. We examine whether nonprofits respond to these incentives, and we find evidence consistent with opportunistic cost shifting to improve the program service and fundraising ratios. Additional analysis finds that smaller nonprofits that are more reliant on donations revenue manipulate their <b>operating</b> <b>ratios</b> to a greater extent...|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of Cartagena, the World Bank has {{estimated}} efficiency gains by comparing {{the evolution of the}} ratio of collected revenues to operational costs (<b>operating</b> <b>ratio)</b> on the one hand to that of the average tariff level on the other hand. The <b>operating</b> <b>ratio</b> is driven essentially by two factors: the evolution of operational costs and collection rates, which are controlled by the private operator, and the evolution of the average tariff, which is exogenous. Whenever the <b>operating</b> <b>ratio</b> increases faster than the tariff, efficiency gains are taking place. The Cartagena privatization achieved significant improvements in efficiency. This is reflected in the doubling over a decade (1995 - 2005) in the ratio of collected revenues to operational costs. At the same time, the average tariff was halved in real terms, suggesting that {{a significant portion of the}} savings achieved through efficiency gains was passed to customers.|$|E

40|$|Measuring bank {{efficiency}} {{is difficult because}} there is no satisfactory definition of bank output. Neither the number of accounts nor total assets, total loans, nor total deposits provide a good index of output. Moreover, the value added of banks - given by their labor costs and profits - measures both the output and cost of banking. Many analysts use accounting data on bank margins, costs and profits as measures of bank efficiency. But the usefulness of such data is undermined by substantial structural and accounting differences across countries, among individual banks and over time. Great caution and extensive knowledge of local banking conditions are required to interpret bank ratios. The author uses three sets of <b>operating</b> <b>ratios</b> to discuss the impact of differences in structure and practice on bank performance: operating asset ratios; operating income ratios; and <b>operating</b> equity <b>ratios.</b> The author also uses return-on-equity (ROE) analysis to highlight the effects of differences in banking structure and practice. The author's analysis is applied to the performance of banks in OECD countries in the 1980 s. The analysis has major implications for assessing bank performance in developing countries, where inflation, higher risk, and operating inefficiencies often cause cost and other bank ratios to be generally higher than in OECD countries.
