5|$|The {{substitution}} method for both P2 and P3 tilings {{can be described}} using Robinson triangles of different sizes. The Robinson triangles arising in P2 tilings (by bisecting kites and darts) are called A-tiles, while those arising in the P3 tilings (by bisecting rhombs) are called B-tiles. The smaller A-tile, denoted AS, is an <b>obtuse</b> Robinson triangle, while the larger A-tile, AL, is acute; in contrast, a smaller B-tile, denoted BS, is an acute Robinson triangle, while the larger B-tile, BL, is <b>obtuse.</b>|$|E
5|$|This variety has open winter rosettes {{composed}} of leaves which are spatulate {{in shape and}} have an <b>obtuse</b> or rounded end. It tends to grow in limestone-based substrates.|$|E
5|$|The dart is a non-convex {{quadrilateral}} whose four {{interior angles}} are 36, 72, 36, and 216 degrees. The dart may be bisected along its {{axis of symmetry}} to form a pair of <b>obtuse</b> Robinson triangles (with angles of 36, 36 and 108 degrees), which are smaller than the acute triangles.|$|E
5|$|The thick rhomb T has {{angles of}} 72, 108, 72, and 108 degrees. The T rhomb may be {{bisected}} along its long diagonal {{to form a}} pair of <b>obtuse</b> Robinson triangles; {{in contrast to the}} P2 tiling, these are larger than the acute triangles.|$|E
5|$|A broad muzzle {{is found}} on the river otter's flat head, and the ears are round and inconspicuous. The rhinarium is bare, with an <b>obtuse,</b> {{triangular}} projection. Eyes of the animal are small and placed anteriorly. A short, broad rostrum for exhaling and a long, broad cranium define the relatively flat skull. The river otter's nostrils and ears close during submersion, inhibiting water from entering them. Its vibrissae (whiskers) are long and thick, enhancing sensory perception underwater and on land.|$|E
5|$|Upon making landfall, David {{brought a}} storm surge of only two-four feet (0.6–1.2 m), {{due to its}} lack of {{strengthening}} and the <b>obtuse</b> angle at which it hit. In addition, David caused strong surf and moderate rainfall, amounting {{to a maximum of}} 8.92 inches (227 mm) in Vero Beach. Though it made landfall as a Category 2 storm, the strongest winds were localized, and the highest reported wind occurred in Fort Pierce, with 70 mph (115 km/h) sustained and 95 mph (155 km/h) gusts.|$|E
5|$|The crossback stingaree's {{pectoral}} fin disc is slightly wider than long and oval in shape, with the anterior margins nearly straight and converging {{at a very}} <b>obtuse</b> angle. The snout is fleshy and blunt, generally not protruding from the disc. The eyes are small and immediately followed by teardrop-shaped spiracles, which have rounded to angular posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril may form a small knob at the back. Between the nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a deeply fringed posterior margin. The mouth is small and strongly arched, containing 36 papillae (nipple-like structures) {{on the floor and}} an additional patch of papillae is present {{on the outside of the}} lower jaw. Both upper and lower teeth are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small, with rounded margins.|$|E
5|$|The {{name of the}} bastion {{refers to}} {{the faces of the}} {{fortification}} and not to the slope of the ground on which it was built; Flat Bastion was constructed on sloping ground. A 1908 map of the Flat Bastion confirms that its south faces join at an <b>obtuse</b> angle which is relatively flat, and nearly parallel to the Charles V Wall. Flat Bastion includes Flat Bastion Magazine within its eastern portion, now a geological research and exhibition facility. The bastion is a listed building with the Gibraltar Heritage Trust. While St. Jago's Bastion has been said to be an early name for Flat Bastion, it has a separate listing with the Gibraltar Heritage Trust, next to those for Flat Bastion and Flat Bastion Magazine.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the pink whipray is diamond-shaped and thick at the center, measuring about 1.1–1.2 times wider than long. The outer {{corners of the}} disc are angular. The snout forms a very <b>obtuse</b> angle, with the tip barely protruding. The small, widely spaced eyes are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin between the long, thin nostrils. The mouth is fairly small and surrounded by prominent furrows; the lower jaw has a small indentation in the middle. There are two large central and two tiny lateral papillae {{on the floor of}} the mouth. The teeth are small and arranged into pavement-like surfaces. Five pairs of gill slits are located beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are small and narrow.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray has a thin, diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc roughly 1.2 times wider than long, with slightly concave leading margins and narrowly rounded outer corners. The snout forms an <b>obtuse</b> angle {{and has a}} pointed tip. The small, closely spaced eyes are followed by crescent-shaped spiracles. The nostrils are elongated and have a skirt-shaped curtain of skin between them; the posterior margin of the curtain is fringed and forms two lobes. The small mouth is surrounded by papillae and bears prominent furrows at the corners. There are two papillae {{on the floor of}} the mouth. The teeth number 33–38 rows in the upper jaw and 31–40 rows in the lower; the teeth are small and vary from pointed to blunt. The five pairs of gill slits are S-shaped. The pelvic fins are medium-sized and triangular with angular corners.|$|E
5|$|The player's character, the part-slug and {{part-cat}} Slugcat, uses {{spears and}} rocks {{to survive a}} hostile, ruined, and <b>obtuse</b> 2D world {{in search of the}} family from whom it was separated. The player is given little explicit guidance and is free to explore the world in any direction via pipes and passages that pass through 1600 static screens, each with randomized enemies. The Slugcat can jump and use debris as weapons to avoid and hurt other creatures while foraging for sparse food, which is used to hibernate in scarce, designated safe rooms. Hibernation resets the day cycle and saves the player's progress. The player can move between regions by having the Slugcat hibernate multiple times without dying. If the player does not reach the hibernation point quickly, a crushing rain will pour, both flooding the world and possibly pummeling the Slugcat to death.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely-spotted {{stingray}} {{has a more}} or less diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc wider than long, with rounded outer corners. The anterior margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at an <b>obtuse</b> angle on the fleshy snout, the tip of which barely protrudes from the disc. The small eyes are immediately followed by comma-shaped spiracles with angular or rounded posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril is enlarged into a knob towards the back. Between the nostrils is a bell-shaped curtain of skin with a finely fringed trailing margin; only the Kapala stingaree (U.kapalensis) has a similarly shaped nasal curtain. The small mouth contains five or six papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor, most of which have forked tips. Additional small papillae are present {{on the outside of the}} lower jaw. The teeth in both jaws are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small and rounded.|$|E
5|$|The spores are , hyaline, amyloid, {{and measure}} 9–11 by 5–6μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are not {{differentiated}} or are occasionally present near the gill edge and similar to cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge). The cheilocystidia, which measure 32–46 by 8–14μm, are tapered on either end and can have two to several <b>obtuse</b> fingerlike projections {{arising from the}} apex. The gill flesh stains vinaceous-brown in iodine. The subhymenium (the tissue layer directly underneath the hymenium) is made of narrow, interwoven hyphae, with the central portion composed of long, cylindrical, and moderately broad cells. The flesh of the cap has a fairly thick subgelatinous , a well-differentiated hypoderm, and a filamentous tramal body. All except the pellicle stain vinaceous-brown in iodine.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the reticulate whipray is diamond-shaped and wider than long, with the leading margins almost straight and the snout and outer corners angular. In juveniles, the disc {{is about as}} wide as long, with a more <b>obtuse</b> snout and rounded corners. The eyes are small and immediately followed by the spiracles (paired respiratory openings). A short and wide curtain of skin with a minutely fringed rear margin is present between the long, thin nostrils. The mouth is relatively small, with a deep concavity {{at the center of}} the lower jaw and shallow furrows at the corners extending onto the lower jaw. A row of 4–5 papillae (nipple-like structures) is found across the floor of the mouth. There are 26–40 upper tooth rows and 27–44 lower tooth rows. The pelvic fins are small and triangular. The tail is whip-like and extremely thin, measuring 3–3.5 times as long as the disc when intact, and lacks fin folds. Usually one serrated stinging spine is located on the upper surface on the tail, some distance from the base.|$|E
25|$|The pentagram {{includes}} ten isosceles triangles: five {{acute and}} five <b>obtuse</b> isosceles triangles. In all of them, {{the ratio of}} the longer side to the shorter side is φ. The acute triangles are golden triangles. The <b>obtuse</b> isosceles triangle highlighted via the colored lines in the illustration is a golden gnomon.|$|E
25|$|Winter buds: Dark red, <b>obtuse,</b> {{one-fourth of}} an inch long. Inner scales enlarge with the growing shoot, {{becoming}} red before they fall.|$|E
25|$|If {{and only}} if it is <b>obtuse</b> (has one angle bigger than a right angle), the {{circumcenter}} lies outside the triangle.|$|E
25|$|A {{triangle}} {{with one}} interior angle measuring more than 90° is an <b>obtuse</b> triangle or obtuse-angled triangle. If c is {{the length of}} the longest side, then , where a and b are the lengths of the other sides.|$|E
25|$|This genus {{consists}} of annual, biennial, or perennial species, often with fleshy, thickened roots. The stems grow erect or procumbent. The alternate leaves are petiolate or sessile, with ovate-cordate to rhombic-cuneate leaf blades, their margins mostly entire, with <b>obtuse</b> apex.|$|E
25|$|As a result, in an {{isosceles}} triangle {{with one or}} two angles of 36°, the longer of the two side lengths is φ times that of the shorter of the two, both {{in the case of the}} acute as in the case of the <b>obtuse</b> triangle.|$|E
25|$|The sum of {{the angles}} of a {{triangle}} is equal to a straight angle (180 degrees). This causes an equilateral triangle to have 3 interior angles of 60 degrees. Also, it causes every triangle {{to have at least}} 2 acute angles and up to 1 <b>obtuse</b> or right angle.|$|E
25|$|Thales' theorem {{implies that}} if the {{circumcenter}} is located {{on one side of}} the triangle, then the opposite angle is a right one. If the circumcenter is located inside the triangle, then the triangle is acute; if the circumcenter is located outside the triangle, then the triangle is <b>obtuse.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to Matthias Schönerer, who was {{involved}} in every major Austrian railway project at the time, rather than a single station, it would be most sensible to build two termini at an <b>obtuse</b> angle to each other. The locomotive factory and other works were to be placed in the space between the two.|$|E
25|$|The {{geometry}} of a cutting sword blade allows for acute edge angles. It should be noted, however, that an edge with an acuter angle is {{more inclined to}} degrade quickly in combat situations than an edge with a more <b>obtuse</b> angle. Also, an acute edge angle is not the primary factor of a blade's sharpness.|$|E
25|$|A Lambert {{quadrilateral}} is a quadrilateral {{which has}} three right angles. The fourth angle of a Lambert quadrilateral is acute if the geometry is hyperbolic, {{a right angle}} if the geometry is Euclidean or <b>obtuse</b> if the geometry is elliptic. Consequently, rectangles exist (a statement equivalent to the parallel postulate) only in Euclidean geometry.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} semi-globose, thin, horny, olivaceous, {{longitudinally}} finely striated. The spire is very short, <b>obtuse.</b> The apex is rather eroded. The last whorl is ventricose. The aperture {{is large and}} semi-ovate. The inner-lip is posteriorly ascending on the body whorl. The columella is straight, excavated, and with a curved, elevated, external ridge continued in front into the outer lip which is simple and acute.|$|E
25|$|A Saccheri {{quadrilateral}} is a quadrilateral {{which has}} {{two sides of}} equal length, both perpendicular to a side called the base. The other two angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are called the summit angles and they have equal measure. The summit angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are acute if the geometry is hyperbolic, right angles if the geometry is Euclidean and <b>obtuse</b> angles if the geometry is elliptic.|$|E
25|$|If angle BCX = α, then XCA = α {{because of}} the bisection, and CAB = α {{because of the}} similar triangles; ABC = 2α from the {{original}} isosceles symmetry, and BXC = 2α by similarity. The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so 5α = 180, giving α = 36°. So the angles of the golden triangle are thus 36°-72°-72°. The angles of the remaining <b>obtuse</b> isosceles triangle AXC (sometimes called the golden gnomon) are 36°-36°-108°.|$|E
25|$|Fluid {{in space}} between the lung and the chest wall is termed a pleural effusion. There needs {{to be at least}} 75ml of pleural fluid in order to blunt the costophrenic angle on the lateral chest radiograph, and 200ml on the posteroanterior chest radiograph. On a lateral decubitus, amounts as small as 50ml of fluid are possible. Pleural effusions {{typically}} have a meniscus visible on an erect chest radiograph, but loculated effusions (as occur with an empyema) may have a lenticular shape (the fluid making an <b>obtuse</b> angle with the chest wall).|$|E
25|$|Miragaia, {{like all}} known stegosaurians, showed {{an array of}} plates and spikes, {{consisting}} of skin ossifications or osteoderms. Paired triangular plates ran down the midline of the neck, reconstructed as eight pairs. They were asymmetrical with a convex outer side and a concave inner side. Their bases were not very expanded {{with the exception of}} a possible last pair, located on the front back. They were <b>obtuse</b> but lightly hooked at the front. A rather long, narrow and straight preserved spike was at first considered to have been a shoulder spine, but was later seen as part of some tail arrangement.|$|E
25|$|She {{should have}} been a man – a great navigator. Her {{powerful}} reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old; and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty, never have given way but with life. She had a head for logic, and a capability of argument unusual in a man and rarer indeed in a woman... impairing this gift was her stubborn tenacity of will which rendered her <b>obtuse</b> to all reasoning where her own wishes, or her own sense of right, was concerned.|$|E
25|$|Euclid {{defines a}} plane angle as the {{inclination}} to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other. According to Proclus an angle must be either a quality or a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept was used by Eudemus, who regarded an angle as a deviation from a straight line; the second by Carpus of Antioch, who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third concept, although his definitions of right, acute, and <b>obtuse</b> angles are certainly quantitative.|$|E
25|$|A related {{notion is}} the one of a minimum {{bounding}} circle, which is the smallest circle that completely contains the polygon within it. Not every polygon has a circumscribed circle, as the vertices of a polygon {{do not need to}} all lie on a circle, but every polygon has a unique minimum bounding circle, which may be constructed by a linear time algorithm. Even if a polygon has a circumscribed circle, it may not coincide with its minimum bounding circle; for example, for an <b>obtuse</b> triangle, the minimum bounding circle has the longest side as diameter and does not pass through the opposite vertex.|$|E
25|$|A {{few other}} rare hybrids {{resemble}} A.×ebenoides. A.×hendersonii, once suggested {{to be the}} same species, has longer sori, more <b>obtuse</b> pinnae, and a scaly stipe. The unnamed triploid backcross of A.×ebenoides with A.rhizophyllum was accidentally generated in culture in 1956, and subsequently identified with a fern collected in West Virginia in 1946, previously identified as an aberrant A.×ebenoides. This hybrid is intermediate between its parents, bearing lobes in the basal part of the frond only, and with purple color extending up the rachis but not the stipe. A.×crucibuli, an artificial hybrid between A.platyneuron and the Asian walking fern, A.ruprechtii, has narrower blades, deeply pinnatifid in the middle and becoming pinnate at the base.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} palaeontological {{indications}} of the grazing. In general, the normal {{position of the}} head can {{be determined by the}} angle between a vertical plane coinciding with the occiput of the cranium, which is always vertical, and a plane through the base of the cranium. A right or acute angle would indicate a head held high for browsing leaves at various heights. Elasmotherium had the most <b>obtuse</b> angle of the Rhinocerotids. It could only reach the lowest levels and therefore must have grazed habitually. This morphological feature favours the identification of the one-horned beast depicted in Rouffignac Cave (shown in this article) as Elasmotherium and lends some validity to the bison-like restorations based on it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Obtuse</b> Angle – {{generally}} {{agreed to be}} based on James Parker, Blake’s fellow apprentice during his time with Basire. George Mills Harper, however, believes that Angle is instead based on Thomas Taylor (Harper agrees with Erdman that Sipsop is not based on Taylor but on William Henry Mathew). Harper argues that Angle seems to be an educator, and his relationship with many of the other characters is that of a teacher and student. This is significant because there is evidence that Blake took lessons in Euclid under Taylor, hence Angle's apparent role as teacher. Erdman supports this theory. Rawlinson suggests that Angle may be partially based on Blake's friend George Cumberland, as well as the antiquarian Francis Douce.|$|E
