25|$|During {{the time}} of the New Comedy (of ancient Greek comedy), prostitute {{characters}} became, after the fashion of slaves, the veritable stars of the comedies. This could be for several reasons: while Old Comedy (of ancient Greek comedy) concerned itself with political subjects, New Comedy dealt with private subjects and the daily life of Athenians. Also, social conventions forbade well-born women from being seen in public; while the plays depicted outside activities. The only women who would normally be seen <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> were logically the prostitutes.|$|E
25|$|Another popular running gag {{concerned}} the social habits of Benny's on-air orchestra, who were consistently {{portrayed as a}} bunch of drunken ne'er-do-wells. Led first by Phil Harris and later by Bob Crosby, the orchestra, and in particular band member Frank Remley, were jokingly portrayed as often being too drunk to play properly, using an overturned bass drum to play cards on just minutes before a show, and so enamored of liquor that {{the sight of a}} glass of milk would make them sick. Remley was portrayed in various unflattering situations, such as being thrown into a garbage can by a road sweeper who had found him passed <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> at 4am, and on a wanted poster at the Beverly Hills police station.|$|E

2500|$|A {{survey of}} Gazan {{residents}} by the Gatestone Institute addressed {{the subject of}} human shields, with respondents issuing statements such as [...] "People received warnings from the Israelis and tried to evacuate... Hamas shot some of those people... The rest were forced {{to return to their}} homes and get bombed"; [...] "Hamas imposed a curfew: anyone walking <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> was shot without being asked any questions. That way Hamas made sure people had to stay in their homes even if they were about to get bombed"; and [...] "My father received a text-message from the Israeli army warning him that our area was going to be bombed, and Hamas prevented us from leaving." ...|$|E
2500|$|As time progressed, Fleva {{became more}} {{sympathetic}} to the [...] "Germanophile" [...] camp, which pushed for committing Romania to the Central Powers (see Romania in World War I). The same course was maintained by Seara, managed at that stage by a consortium of businessmen from the German Empire. Dimineața daily, which had anti-German and pro-Entente sentiments, reported with pleasure that the Germans could not convince Fleva to take over as Searas editorial manager; its claims were partly backed by Fleva's own note, published in Dreptatea (November–December 1914). Fleva reportedly received such offers from two German propagandists, Hilmar von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen and Josef B. Brociner. Not dignifying them with an answer, he even threw Brociner <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Interviewed by Adevărul, he denounced Bussche's politics, and called off his bid.|$|E

Reflecting on his childhood in The Bronx, DeLillo later described how he was [...] "...always <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> As a little boy I whiled away most of my time pretending to be a baseball announcer on the radio. I could think up games for hours at a time. There were eleven of us in a small house, but the close quarters were never a problem. I didn't know things any other way. We always spoke English and Italian all mixed up together. My grandmother, who lived in America for fifty years, never learned English." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010 France banned face {{coverings}} {{including women}} wearing the niqab. The French Collective against Islamophobia reported [...] "an explosion" [...] {{in the number}} of physical attacks on women wearing the niqab. Kenza Drider, a protester against the law, said: [...] "I'm insulted about three to four times a day. Most say, 'Go home'; some say, 'We'll kill you.' One said: 'We'll do to you what we did to the Jews.'... I feel that I now know what Jewish women went through before the Nazi roundups in France. When they went <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> they were identified, singled out, they were vilified. Now that's happening to us." [...] After the Charlie Hebdo shooting in January 2015, there were reports of attacks on mosques and Muslim citizens throughout the country.|$|E
2500|$|On Franklin's {{return to}} England in October 1822, {{none of the}} rumours or {{criticism}} mattered. The failure to meet the expedition's key goals was overlooked in favour of admiration of his tale of courage {{in the face of}} adversity. Franklin, who had been made a commander in his absence, was promoted to captain on 20 November 1822 and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, while Back was made a lieutenant. Franklin's account of the expedition, published in 1823, was regarded as a classic of travel literature and, when the publishing company could not keep up with demand, second-hand copies sold for up to ten guineas. Ordinary people would point him <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> and, recalling his desperate measures to avoid starvation, he became affectionately known as [...] "the man who ate his boots".|$|E
