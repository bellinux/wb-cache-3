5|$|During {{the first}} centuries AD, Palmyra's main trade route ran {{east to the}} Euphrates where it {{connected}} at the city of Hīt. The route then ran south along the river toward the port of Charax Spasinu <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf,</b> where Palmyrene ships traveled {{back and forth to}} India. Goods were imported from India, China and Transoxiana, and exported west to Emesa (or Antioch) then the Mediterranean ports, from which they were distributed throughout the Roman Empire. In addition to the usual route some Palmyrene merchants used the Red Sea, probably {{as a result of the}} Roman–Parthian Wars. Goods were carried overland from the seaports to a Nile port, and then taken to the Egyptian Mediterranean ports for export. Inscriptions attesting a Palmyrene presence in Egypt date to the reign of Hadrian.|$|E

25|$|Had it {{had been}} {{completed}} earlier, the Berlin-Baghdad (and ultimately Basra) railway would have enabled transport and trade from Germany through a port <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf,</b> from which trade goods and supplies could be exchanged directly with the farthest of the German colonies, and the world. The journey home to Germany would have given German industry direct supply of oil. This access to resources, with trade less affected by British control of shipping, would have been beneficial to German economic interests in industry and trade, and threatening to British economic dominance in colonial trade.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the Persian Gulf {{nations of}} Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE {{produced}} about 25% of the world's oil, held {{nearly two-thirds of}} the world's crude oil reserves, and about 35% of the world's natural gas reserves. The oil-rich countries (excluding Iraq) that have a coastline <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> are referred to as the Persian Gulf States.

5000|$|According to <b>the</b> book Documents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf's</b> Name, <b>the</b> Eternal Heritage of Ancient Time: <b>the</b> term <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> and its {{equivalents}} {{have been}} used continuously since 400 BC in all languages specially in the Arabic language. In 1964 the Arab League ratified a change of the name to the Arabian Gulf (Al khaleej Al Arabi), apparently a change accepted by many Arab-speaking countries. After the Iran-Iraq War, the decision was realised. The act angered Iran/Iranians, especially when the Arabs used the new appellation in the English mass media. While historical documents show that the waterway has always {{been referred to as}} the 'Persian Gulf,' certain Arab states have made efforts to remove 'Persian' from the name of the waterway. After many gatherings and seminars by the NGOs and the geographers of Iran asking the government to preserve the heritage name of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>gulf,</b> finally <b>the</b> Islamic Republic of Iran, in 2004 officially designated April 30 as <b>the</b> [...] "National <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> Day".|$|R

25|$|Iran has 1,786 {{kilometers}} of coastline <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> and the Gulf of Oman. These southern waters {{are rich in}} fish and other marine resources. In 2004 the catch off the southern coast totaled 299,000 tons. This represented an average annual increase of 12.6 percent since 1976. The southern catch either is used directly by households and restaurants or processed and preserved by industry. Expansion of the fishery infrastructure would enable the country to harvest an estimated 700,000 tons of fish annually from the southern waters. However, increased pollution from the oil industry and other enterprises poses {{a serious threat to}} this area’s fishing industry.|$|E
25|$|Operation Desert Storm began {{early on}} 17 January 1991, and the 11th Marines fired its first {{artillery}} mission against Iraqi forces, when {{elements of the}} regiment conducted an early morning surface artillery raid just south of Khafji.

25|$|Funding, {{engineering}} and construction was mainly provided by German Empire banks Deutsche Bank and companies Philipp Holzmann, {{which in the}} 1890s had built the Anatolian Railway (Anatolische Eisenbahn) connecting Constantinople, Ankara and Konya. The Ottoman Empire wished to maintain its control of Arabian Peninsula and to expand its influence across the Red Sea into the nominally Ottoman (until 1914) Khedivate of Egypt, which had been under British military control since the Urabi Revolt in 1882. If the railway had been completed, the Germans would have gained access to suspected oil fields in Mesopotamia, {{as well as a}} connection to the port of Basra <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf.</b> The latter would have provided access to the eastern parts of the German colonial empire, and avoided the Suez Canal, which was controlled by British-French interests.|$|E
25|$|At the age {{of twenty}} Panahi was conscripted into the Iranian army and served in the Iran–Iraq War, working as an army cinematographer from 1980 until 1982.

After completing his military service, Panahi enrolled at the College of Cinema and TV in Tehran, where he studied filmmaking and especially appreciated the works of film directors Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Luis Buñuel, and Jean-Luc Godard. At school he first met and befriended filmmaker Parviz Shahbazi and cinematographer Farzad Jodat, who would later shoot all of Panahi's early work. During college he interned at the Bandar Abbas Center <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> Coast where {{he made his first}} short documentary films.

25|$|Eannatum, {{grandson}} of Ur-Nanshe, made himself {{master of the}} whole of the district of Sumer, together with the cities of Uruk (ruled by Enshakushana), Ur, Nippur, Akshak, and Larsa. He also annexed the kingdom of Kish; however, it recovered its independence after his death. Umma was made tributary—a certain amount of grain being levied upon each person in it, that had to be paid into the treasury of the goddess Nina and the god Ningirsu. Eannatum's campaigns extended beyond the confines of Sumer, and he overran a part of Elam, took the city of Az <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf,</b> and exacted tribute as far as Mari; however many of the realms he conquered were often in revolt. During his reign, temples and palaces were repaired or erected at Lagash and elsewhere; the town of Nina—that probably gave its name to the later Niniveh—was rebuilt, and canals and reservoirs were excavated. Eannatum was succeeded by his brother, En-anna-tum I. During his rule, Umma once more asserted independence under Ur-Lumma, who attacked Lagash unsuccessfully. Ur-Lumma was replaced by a priest-king, Illi, who also attacked Lagash.|$|E
25|$|Al Jazeera's {{availability}} (via satellite) {{throughout the}} Middle East changed the television {{landscape of the}} region. Prior {{to the arrival of}} Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of freedom of speech on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf,</b> including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program El-Itidjah el-Mouakass ("The Opposite Direction"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen.|$|E
25|$|Beginning with Selim I's {{acquisition}} of Medina and Mecca in 1517, the Ottomans, in the 16th century, added to their Empire the Hejaz and Asir regions along the Red Sea and the Al Hasa region <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> coast, these {{being the most}} populous parts {{of what was to}} become Saudi Arabia. They also laid claim to the interior, although this remained a rather nominal suzerainty. The degree of control over these lands varied over the next four centuries with the fluctuating strength or weakness of the Empire's central authority. In the Hejaz, the Sharifs of Mecca were largely left in control of their territory (although there would often be an Ottoman governor and garrison in Mecca). On {{the eastern side of the}} country, the Ottomans lost control of the Al Hasa region to Arab tribes in the 17th century but regained it again in the 19th century. Throughout the period, the interior remained under the rule of a large number of petty tribal rulers in much the same way as it had in previous centuries.|$|E
