40|$|Abstract: In the {{development}} of a modular fixture design system, it is essential to have a modular fixture element database that can be integrated with a CAD system, in addition to the other considerations such as fixture configuration, <b>interference</b> <b>checking,</b> etc., which are also important to fixture designers. This paper describes a new method to create the fixture element database and model the fixturing towers (i. e. subassem-blies).

The oxygen-dependent inhibition is stronger {{in the presence of}} superoxide dismutase, whereas cyanide counteracts the <b>oxygen</b> <b>interference.</b> On the other hand, the oxidation of NADH mediated by PMS and dioxygen is affected only marginally by superoxide dismutase and cyanide. Therefore, it is concluded that the involvement of superoxide anions occurs at the level of nitro BT reduction via a nitro blue tetrazolinyl radical, as has been suggested by Picker and Fridovich [1984) Arch.

The inhibition of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>interference</b> in the nitro BT reduction by cyanide is dependent on the cyanide concentration, whereas in nitrogen cyanide has no effect on the reduction. It is caused by competition between cyanide and oxygen to reduce or oxidize the nitro BT radical to either formazan with concomitant cyanogen production or nitro BT, respectively.

40|$|The most {{intuitive}} memory consistency {{model for}} shared-memory multi-threaded programming is sequential consistency (SC). However, current concurrent programming languages support a relaxed model, as such relaxations are deemed necessary for enabling important optimizations. This paper demonstrates that an SC-preserving compiler, one that ensures that every SC {{behavior of a}} compiler-generated binary is an SC behavior of the source program, retains most of the performance benefits of an optimizing compiler. The key observation is that a large class of optimizations crucial for performance are either already SC-preserving or can be modified to preserve SC while retaining much of their effectiveness. An SC-preserving compiler, obtained by restricting the optimization phases in LLVM, a state-of-the-art C/C++ compiler, incurs an average slowdown of 3. 8 % and a maximum slowdown of 34 % {{on a set of}} 30 programs from the SPLASH- 2, PARSEC, and SPEC CINT 2006 benchmark suites. While the performance overhead of preserving SC in the compiler is much less than previously assumed, it might still be unacceptable for certain applications. We believe there are several avenues for improving performance without giving up SC-preservation. In this vein, we observe that the overhead of our SC-preserving compiler arises mainly from its inability to aggressively perform a class of optimizations we identify as eager-load optimizations. This class includes common-subexpression elimination, constant propagation, global value numbering, and common cases of loop-invariant code motion. We propose a notion of <b>interference</b> <b>checks</b> in order to enable eager-load optimizations while preserving SC. <b>Interference</b> <b>checks</b> expose to the compiler a commonly used hardware speculation mechanism that can efficiently detect whether a particular variable has changed its value since last read...|$|R

Each rail starts from a node on the boundary and propagates towards the MA and then from the MA towards the boundary. Quadrilateral elements are then obtained by placing nodes on these rails and connecting them inside each track formed by adjacent rails. Spacing between the rails and between the nodes on the rails are xed at the boundary of the region.
