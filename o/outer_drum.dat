2500|$|Another {{example of}} a {{rotating}} device in which a reactive centrifugal force can be identified {{used to describe the}} system behavior is the centrifugal clutch. [...] A centrifugal clutch is used in small engine-powered devices such as chain saws, go-karts and model helicopters. It allows the engine to start and idle without driving the device, but automatically and smoothly engages the drive as the engine speed rises. A spring is used to constrain the spinning clutch shoes. At low speeds, the spring provides the centripetal force to the shoes, which move to larger radius as the speed increases and the spring stretches under tension. [...] At higher speeds, when the shoes can't move any further out to increase the spring tension, due to the <b>outer</b> <b>drum,</b> the drum provides some of the centripetal force that keeps the shoes moving in a circular path. The force of tension applied to the spring, and the outward force applied to the drum by the spinning shoes are the corresponding reactive centrifugal forces. [...] The mutual force between the drum and the shoes provides the friction needed to engage the output drive shaft that is connected to the drum. Thus the centrifugal clutch illustrates both the fictitious centrifugal force and the reactive centrifugal force.|$|E

40|$|In {{composite}} agricultural {{materials such}} as grass, tee, medicinal plants; leaves and stems have a different drying time. By this behavior, after leaving the dryer, the stems may have greater moisture content than desired, while the leaves one minor, which can cause either the appearance of fungi or {{the collapse of the}} over-dried material. Taking into account that a lot of grass is dehydrated in forced air dryers, especially rotary drum dryers, this research was developed in order to establish conditions enabling to make a separation of the components during the drying process in order to provide a homogeneous product at the end. For this, a rotary dryer consisting of three concentric cylinders and a circular sieve aligned with the more internal cylinder was proposed; so that, once material enters into the dryer {{in the area of the}} inner cylinder, stems pass through sieve to the middle and then continue towards the external cylinder, while the leaves continue by the inner cylinder. For this project, a mixture of Ryegrass and White Clover was used. The characteristics of the components of a mixture were: Drying Rate in thin layer and in rotation, Bulk density, Projected Area, Terminal velocity, weight/Area Ratio, Flux through Rotary sieve. Three drying temperatures; 40 °C, 60 ° C and 80 ° C, and three rotation speeds; 10 rpm, 20 rpm and 40 rpm were evaluated. It was found that the differences in drying time are the less at 80 °C when the dryer rotates at 40 rpm. Above this speed, the material adheres to the walls of the dryer or sieve and does not flow. According to the measurements of terminal velocity of stems and leaves of the components of the mixture, the speed of the air should be less than 1. 5 m s- 1 in the inner drum for the leaves and less than 4. 5 m s- 1 in middle and <b>outer</b> <b>drums</b> for stems, in such way that only the rotational movement of the dryer moves the material and achieves a greater residence time. In other hand, the best rotary sieve separation efficiencies were achieved when the material is dry, but the results are good in all the moisture contents. The best rotary speed of sieve is within the critical rotational speed, i. e. 20 rpm. However, the rotational speed of the dryer, including the sieve in line with the inner cylinder should be 10 rpm or less in order to achieve the greatest residence times of the material inside the dryer and the best agitation through the use of lifting flights. With a finite element analysis of a dryer prototype, using an air flow allowing speeds of air already stated, I was found that the best performance occurs when, through a cover, air enters the dryer front of the Middle cylinder and when the inner cylinder is formed in its entirety through a sieve. This way, air flows in almost equal amounts by both the middle and external cylinders, while part of the air in the Middle cylinder passes through the sieve towards the inner cylinder. With this, leaves do not adhere to the sieve and flow along drier, thanks to the rotating movement of the drums and the showering caused by the lifting flights. In these conditions, the differences in drying time are reduced to 60 minutes, but the residence time is higher for the stems than for leaves, therefore the components of the mixture of grass run out of the dryer with the same desired moisture content.

For the gas present in a drum containing a pit, alphas from decays of plutonium are stopped by the primary container wall of the pit itself unless pit leakage occurs. If plutonium leaks from the pit and enters the fill-gas (either noble gas or air) of the outer container, each of the alpha particles due to the decay of plutonium will create about 10 {sup 5 } electron-ion pairs along its track.

This building was built on two octagonal rings of brick piers, which supported a structure 125 feet in diameter, and an inner drum 40 feet in diameter. As with the previous structure, it suffered from its exposure to the monsoons and the sea, and concerns over its safety were voiced soon after its constructions and over the years. In 1841, the market was extended {{on one side of the}} main building under the supervision of contractor Denis McSwiney with the erection of a new fish market. This new structure was a long open shed, and it was later further extended to run roughly parallel to two sides of the octagonal market. The extension would help protect the main market by serving as a breakwater to reduce the force of the swells and surf from the east. The Telok Ayer market needed to be repaired soon after construction, nevertheless, it stood for over 40 years until it was demolished when land was reclaimed on Telok Ayer Bay, and the prominence of the market on the waterfront made the building a landmark of early Singapore.|$|E

40|$|A new {{radioactive}} shipping packaging for transporting bulk {{quantities of}} tritium, the Bulk Tritium Shipping Package (BTSP), {{has been designed}} for the Department of Energy (DOE) {{as a replacement for}} a package designed in the early 1970 s. This paper summarizes significant design features and describes how the design satisfies the regulatory safety requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The BTSP design incorporates many improvements over its predecessor by implementing improved testing, handling, and maintenance capabilities, while improving manufacturability and incorporating new engineered materials. This paper also discusses the results from testing of the BTSP to 10 CFR 71 Normal Conditions of Transport and Hypothetical Accident Condition events. The programmatic need of the Department of Energy (DOE) to ship bulk quantities of tritium has been satisfied since the late 1970 s by the UC- 609 shipping package. The current Certificate of Conformance for the UC- 609, USA/ 9932 /B(U) (DOE), will expire in late 2011. Since the UC- 609 was not designed to meet current regulatory requirements, it will not be recertified and thereby necessitates a replacement Type B shipping package for continued DOE tritium shipments in the future. A replacement tritium packaging called the Bulk Tritium Shipping Package (BTSP) is currently being designed and tested by Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). The BTSP consists of two primary assemblies, an <b>outer</b> <b>Drum</b> Assembly and an inner Containment Vessel Assembly (CV), both designed to mitigate damage and to protect the tritium contents from leaking during the regulatory Hypothetical Accident Condition (HAC) events and during Normal Conditions of Transport (NCT). During transport, the CV rests on a silicone pad within the Drum Liner and is covered with a thermal insulating disk within the insulated Drum Assembly. The BTSP packaging weighs approximately 500 lbs without contents and is 50 - 1 / 2 inches high by 24 - 1 / 2 inches in outside diameter. With contents the gross weight of the BTSP is 650 lbs. The BTSP is designed for the safe shipment of 150 grams of tritium in a solid or gaseous state. To comply with the federal regulations that govern Type B shipping packages, the BTSP is designed so that it will not lose tritium at a rate greater than the limits stated in 10 CFR 71. 51 of 10 {sup - 6 } A 2 per hour for the 'Normal Conditions of Transport' (NCT) and an A 2 in 1 week under 'Hypothetical Accident Conditions' (HAC). Additionally, since the BTSP design incorporates a valve as part of the tritium containment boundary, secondary containment features are incorporated in the CV Lid to protect against gas leakage past the valve as required by 10 CFR 71. 43 (e). This secondary containment boundary is designed to provide the same level of containment as the primary containment boundary when subjected to the HAC and NCT criteria...|$|E
40|$|Thermal, {{mechanical}} and physical properties have been measured on cane fiberboard samples following accelerated aging {{for up to}} approximately 7 years. The aging environments have included elevated temperature < 250 ?F (the maximum allowed service temperature for fiberboard in 9975 packages) and elevated humidity. The results from this testing have been analyzed, and aging models fit to the data. Correlations relating several properties (thermal conductivity, energy absorption, weight loss and height decrease) to their rate of change in potential storage environments have been developed. Combined with {{an estimate of the}} actual conditions the fiberboard experiences in KAMS, these models allow development of service life predictions. Some of the predicted degradation rates presented in this report are relatively extreme. However, these relate to environments that do not exist within KAMS, or would be postulated only as upset conditions that would not likely persist for an extended period. For a typical package with ~ 10 watts internal heat load or less, and ambient temperatures below 90 ?F, the fiberboard experiences storage conditions less severe than any of the aging environments. Little or no degradation of the fiberboard is expected for typical storage conditions. It {{should be noted that the}} ultimate service life will be determined by the cumulative effect of degradation from all the conditions these packages might encounter. The assumptions and inputs behind the models in this report should be well understood before attempting to identify an actual service life in KAMS. Additional data continue to be collected to permit future refinements to the models and assumptions. For developing service life predictions, the ambient conditions within KAMS can be reasonably identified, and the temperature profiles within the various packages (with a range of heat loads and at varying locations within an array of packages) can be calculated. However, the humidity within the package is not as well characterized. While the <b>outer</b> <b>drum</b> does not provide an air-tight seal, it does greatly restrict the gain or loss of moisture in the fiberboard. Preliminary efforts have identified a relationship between the moisture content of fiberboard samples and the relative humidity of the surrounding air, but further work is needed in this area. Improvement in understanding this relationship might be realized with a change in the way humidity data are collected during field surveillances. It is recommended that the humidity be measured through a caplug hole before the package is removed from its storage location. The package would remain in thermal equilibrium, and anomalous humidity changes could be avoided. Further work should be performed to better define KAMS storage conditions and the environment within the 9975 shipping packages, and to identify appropriate limits for each property. This should be a joint effort by SRNL and NMM personnel. The results and model predictions presented in this report are applicable to 9975 packages with cane fiberboard overpack assemblies. A separate effort is underway to identify whether softwood fiberboard would behave similarly. In addition, the degradation models do not address the effects of non-conforming conditions such as the presence of excess moisture and mold, or beetle infestations...|$|E
40|$|Hot mix asphalt {{recycling}} {{has become}} common practice {{all over the}} world since the 1970 s because of the crisis in oil prices. In the Netherlands, hot recycling has advanced {{to such an extent that}} in most of the mixtures more than 50 % of reclaimed asphalt (RA) is allowed. These mixtures with such a high RA content are produced in a batch plant to which a parallel drum is attached. In this drum RA is pre-heated to approximately 130 °C. Since 2007 another hot mix recycling techniques became available in which RA is mixed in cold and moist condition in contrary to conventional methods. It is a so called double barrel drum mixer. In this method virgin aggregates are superheated in the inner drum and mixed with cool and moist RA and fines and virgin bitumen in the <b>outer</b> <b>drum.</b> In both cases, double drum and partial heating methods, the virgin aggregates have to be pre-heated to higher temperatures than with mixtures without RA in order to achieve a mixing temperature of around 170 °C. Dependent on RA amount, moisture, pre-heating, etc. in the batch plant the virgin aggregates have to be pre-heated to around 300 ° C and in the double barrel drum to around 500 °C. These high temperatures have led to concerns about the quality of the produced mixtures. Since 2008, a new Dutch specification system for asphalt mixtures is in place in line with the European standards (EN 13108 series). The new regulation gives contractors freedom to select their own material such as bitumen grade and the amount of recycling; however, in return it makes them responsible for the quality of the mixture. The mixture should fulfill the requirement of fundamental performance characteristics of the mixtures such as resistance to fatigue and permanent deformation. In this research two major questions have been investigated. One of the questions is whether these high temperatures have a negative effect on the bituminous binder, while the other important question is whether the RA binder will blend totally with the virgin binder that is added. The focus of this research was on four objectives. The first objective was to develop a laboratory mixing method to simulate the real recycling process in the field. The second objective was to assess the effect of the double barrel drum on the mixture quality in comparison with conventional batch plant. Third, it was aimed to measure the blending degree between two binders. And finally, to increase the understanding of the mechanism behind blending RA binders with virgin bitumen, with focus on their micro structure. To cover all research topics, this dissertation is organized in two parts in which the first part is devoted to laboratory and field mixture evaluation while the second part is presenting the exploratory research on the fundamental aspects of blending. Research in part 1 is conducted in two phases, laboratory simulation and field experimentation. The conventional partial warming recycling method (PW) the upgraded double drum mixing method (UPG) were simulated in the lab and the quality of mixtures were compared with the standard mixing method (SM) in the lab at different RA content and different moisture content. This research showed that higher percentages of RA results in higher stiffness and lower fatigue life. However in the UPG method with 4 % moisture and 60 % RA, the mixture became remarkably lower in stiffness and durable against fatigue. This might be because of the lack of blending or the effect of foaming of bitumen. It was concluded that the UPG method could not effectively be simulated in the lab. In the next experimental phase of the study, three identical mixtures were produced with 50 % RA and 4. 3 % bitumen. One mixture was produced in a batch plant (BB) while the second one was mixed using a double drum mixer by the same contractor (A). The third mixture was produced in the laboratory (L) using a lab pugmill mixer. The comparison between three mixtures shows that mixture L has a higher stiffness than A and BB. Mixture BB has as slightly higher stiffness than A. Furthermore, mixture A has the lowest stiffness which is most probably due to the system of cold and moist RA feeding into the double drum system. Besides the 4 PB fatigue and stiffness test, monotonic uniaxial tension (UT) and compression (UC) tests were performed to be used in material modeling and to determine a fatigue endurance limit. The limit value of the stress ratio parameter (Rlimit) was determined which is useful in the determination of the endurance limit in a three-dimensional state. It shows that different mixing methods lead to different endurance limits. It turns out that the plant produced mixture has a higher endurance limit than the laboratory mixture. In this research an infrared thermography method was used in every material preparation stage. The temperature homogeneity of the mixtures in the lab and in the field was investigated. It proved to be a useful method in visualizing the temperature exchange during mixing and compaction. In Part 2, the effect of superheating aggregates is studied by simulating RA and real aggregates with glass beads and artificial aged binder. The stage extraction method was evaluated in this research with respect to size and shape of aggregates. The blending and diffusion mechanism between old and new bitumen is studied at the microstructure level by means of Nano indention and Nano-CT scanning. The morphology of different types of bitumen was detectable by these techniques; however the blending zone couldn’t be characterized. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
