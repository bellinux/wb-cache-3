40|$|We {{report on}} the finding of hidden hyperchaos in a 5 D {{extension}} to a known 3 D self-exciting homopolar disc dynamo. The hidden hyperchaos is identified through three positive Lyapunov exponents {{under the condition that}} the proposed model has just two stable equilibrium states in certain regions of parameter space. The new 5 D hyperchaotic self-exciting homopolar disc dynamo has multiple attractors including point attractors, limit cycles, quasi-periodic dynamics, hidden chaos or hyperchaos, as well as coexisting attractors. We use numerical integrations to create phase plane trajectories, produce bifurcation diagram and compute Lyapunov exponents to verify the hidden attractors. Because no unstable equilibria exist in two parameter regions, the system has multistability and six kinds of complex dynamic behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this feature has not been previously reported in any other high-dimensional system. Moreover, the 5 D hyperchaotic system has been simulated using a specially designed electronic circuit and viewed on an oscilloscope, thereby confirming the results of the numerical integrations. Both Matlab and the <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>outputs</b> produce similar phase portraits. Such implementations in real time represents a new type of hidden attractor with important consequences for engineering applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{a new system}} of three coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations, whose dynamics support periodic and chaotic attractors as certain parameters vary. In its most general form, the system has nine parameters. However we can set up to three of these parameters to zero, and still obtain complex dynamics. Here we discuss the case where only two of these parameters are set to zero, and present two-parameter bifurcation linear stability curves for various combinations of the remaining parameters. Then we compute Lyapunov exponents, to verify the regimes of chaotic dynamics, and use adaptive control theory to influence the behaviour. An electronic circuit model of the new chaotic system has been designed and its simulations have been performed using an ORCAD-PSpice program. An experimental realisation of the new chaotic circuit has been carried out and <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>outputs</b> have been compared with numerical (digital) and electronic circuit simulation results. We then used the chaotic system to design a random number generator, and show that the new system has the potential of being used in several scientific and engineering fields such as communication, image processing, physics and mechatronics...|$|R

40|$|The UWB radar {{operates}} simultaneously {{over large}} bandwidth and the antenna parameters must refer to simultaneous performance {{over the whole}} of the bandwidth. Conventional frequency domain (FD) parameters like pattern, gain, etc. are not adequate for UWB antenna. This paper describes an UWB radar antenna planar near field (PNF) measurement system under construction to get the impulse response or transient characteristic of the UWB antenna. Unlike the conventional antenna or RCS time domain test system, the UWB radar signal instead of the carrier-free short time pulse was used to excite the antenna that can avoid the decrease of the dynamic range and satisfy the needs of SAR and the other UWB radar antennas measurement. In order to demonstrate the data analysis program, FDTD simulation software was used to calculate the E-field of M×N points in a fictitious plane at different times just like the actual oscilloscope’s sampling signals in the time domain planar near field (TDPNF) measurement. The calculated results can be considered the actual <b>oscilloscope’s</b> sampling <b>output</b> signals. Through nondirect frequency domain near field to far field transform and direct time domain near field to far field transform, we get the almost same radiation patterns comparing to the FD measurements and software simulation results.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1992 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaReal-time {{computation}} {{speed is}} an additional requirement for simulations. It is necessary for 'man-in-the-loop' systems like flight simulators and for 'hardware-in-the-loop' systems where real components like new closed loop controllers are tested under realistic conditions. In the past {{a lot of companies}} have designed and built special purpose simulation computers which are very powerful but expensive and not handy enough for 'in-the-field-tests'. The progress in computer science shows a trend to distributed systems where multiple processors are running in parallel to improve the performance dramatically. At the DLR Institute for Flight Mechanics a computer system, based on the transputer, was designed to achieve the real-time simulation capabilities for the ROTEST model rotor. This four-bladed rotor is a 2. 5 scale of the BO 105 main rotor, equipped with elastic blades, operating at 1050 rpm. After an introduction to the ROTEST rotor, including the demands upon the simulation, a short introduction to transputers and the associated philosophy is given. The next part of the paper presents the characteristics of the simulation model, its mathematical description and the transputer architecture on which it is running. In {{the last part of the}} paper the input and output processes to the simulation are described. This includes a real-time representation of the rotor and an <b>oscilloscope</b> like <b>output</b> device, as well as analogue input and output devices to a controller...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} carried out to study the {{characteristics}} {{of different types of}} piezoelectric device and experimental work on how to obtain power generation by piezoelectric device. The objectives of this research are to investigate the different characteristic from different types of piezoelectric device and to find the method how to obtain power generation by piezoelectric devices. A test rig consists of the releaser, steel ball, specimen holder, and ruler to run this experiment. The types of piezoelectric used are single layer piezoelectric disc and two layer piezoelectric discs. The voltage produces from the piezoelectric devices are from the different impact forces applied on the device. The impact forces are from the steel ball which is release from different heights. The voltage signal produced from piezoelectric was captured by electrical device called <b>oscilloscope.</b> The voltage <b>output</b> for the single layer piezoelectric and two layers piezoelectric at the different impact force were recorded and analyzed. All the value recorded was compared to the different impact force applied. The result shows that the voltage output from the single layer piezoelectric are higher than the voltage output from the two layers piezoelectric at any impact force applied. The deflection of the piezoelectric is directly proportional to the voltage output. The conclusion has shown that the voltage produces by two layers piezoelectric are lower than single layer piezoelectric because the placement of the specimen is not optimum which mean there is limitation for the specimen to gain maximum deflection...|$|R
