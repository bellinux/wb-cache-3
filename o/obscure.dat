40|$|The aim of our {{research}} is to explore the suitable range of pH for Odontobutis <b>obscures</b> Include the influence of pH on the survival, growth and activities of digestive enzymes of Odontobutis <b>obscures.</b> The results showed that Odontobutis <b>obscures</b> can survive well at 6. 5 ~ 8. 5 of pH. At 8. 0 of pH, Odontobutis <b>obscures</b> gained fastest, the average weight gain rate was 21. 23 %. The activity of protease, amylase and lipase of the Odontobutis <b>obscures</b> increase with pH; while attained the maximum, activities of digestive enzymes decreased with pH.

40|$|Abstract. We present early {{results from}} the spectroscopic {{follow-up}} of a sample of candidate <b>obscured</b> AGN selected in the mid-infrared from the Spitzer First Look Survey. Our selection allows a direct comparison of the numbers of <b>obscured</b> and unobscured AGN at a given luminosity for the first time, and shows that the ratio of <b>obscured</b> to unobscured AGN at infrared luminosities corresponding to low luminosity quasars is ≈ 1 : 1 at z ∼ 0. 5. Most of our optically-faint candidate <b>obscured</b> AGN have the high-ionization, narrow-line spectra expected from type- 2 AGN. A composite spectrum shows evidence for Balmer absorption lines, indicating recent star-formation activity in the host galaxies. There is tentative evidence for {{a decrease in the}} <b>obscured</b> AGN fraction with increasing AGN luminosity.
