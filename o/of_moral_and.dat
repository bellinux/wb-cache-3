5|$|Israeli {{historian}} Omer Bartov, {{writing for}} The New York Times Book Review, judged The Holocaust Industry to be marred {{by the same}} errors he denounces in those who exploit the Holocaust for profit or politics:It is filled with {{precisely the kind of}} shrill hyperbole that Finkelstein rightly deplores in much of the current media hype over the Holocaust; it is brimming with the same indifference to historical facts, inner contradictions, strident politics and dubious contextualizations; and it oozes with the same smug sense <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> intellectual superiority... Like any conspiracy theory, it contains several grains of truth; and like any such theory, it is both irrational and insidious.|$|E

25|$|As {{elsewhere}} in the British Isles there was a tradition <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> domestic fiction {{in the early nineteenth}} century. It did not flourish to the same extent in Scotland, but did produce a number of significant publications. These included Elizabeth Hamilton's (1756?–1816), Cottagers of Glenburnie (1808), Mary Brunton's (1778–1818) Discipline (1814) and Christian Johnstone's Clan-Albin (1815).|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1940s the KMT had {{eliminated}} dissent for its cultural policies. When Taiwanese had resumed the cultural activities, which were outlawed by the Japanese in 1937, the Nationalist attitude was that Taiwanese had been Japanese “slaves” and would therefore have {{to complete a}} period <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> ideological tutelage before they could enjoy their full rights as citizens of the Republic of China. The February 28 Incident destroyed Taiwan’s urban elite {{and the arrival of}} the mainlander elite ensured Nationalist domination of urban cultural centers.|$|E
25|$|This period saw a {{proliferation}} of pamphlets, tracts, satires, and memoirs; the success of short-story collections (“nouvelles”) as well as collections of oral tales and anecdotes (“propos and devis”); a public fascination with tragic tales from Italy (most notably those of Bandello); a considerable increase in the translating and publishing of contemporary European authors (especially Italians and Spaniards) compared to authors from the Middle Ages and classical antiquity; an important {{increase in the number}} of religious works sold (devotional books would beat out the “belles-lettres” as the most sold genre in France at the beginning of the 17th century); and finally, the publication of important works <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> philosophical reflection.|$|E

25|$|Whigs favored {{economic}} expansion through an activist government, Democrats through limited central government. Whigs supported corporate charters, a national bank, and paper currency; Democrats {{were opposed to}} all three. Whigs also favored more humanitarian reforms than did Democrats, including public schools, abolition of capital punishment, prison and asylum reform and temperance. Whigs were more optimistic than Democrats, generally speaking, and more enterprising. They did not object to helping a specific group if doing so would promote the general welfare. The chartering of corporations, they argued, expanded economic opportunity for everyone, laborers and farmers alike. Democrats, distrustful of concentrated economic power and <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> economic coercion, held fast to the Jeffersonian principle of limited government.|$|E
25|$|By 1921–2 the {{coalition}} had become embroiled {{in an air}} <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> financial corruption (e.g. the sale of honours). Besides the recent Irish Treaty and Edwin Montagu's moves towards greater self-government for India, both of which dismayed rank-and-file Conservative opinion, the government's willingness to intervene against the Bolshevik regime in Russia also seemed {{out of step with}} the new and more pacifist mood. A sharp slump in 1921 and a wave of strikes in the coal and railway industries also added to the government's unpopularity, as did the apparent failure of the Genoa Conference, which ended in an apparent rapprochement between Germany and Soviet Russia. In other words, it was no longer the case that Lloyd George was an electoral asset to the Conservative Party.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, as {{a result}} of oil wealth and the {{modernization}} of the country initiated by King Faisal, important changes to Saudi society were under way {{and the power of the}} ulema was in decline. However, this changed following the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 by Islamist radicals. The government's response to the crisis included strengthening the ulema's powers and increasing their financial support: in particular, they were given greater control over the education system and allowed to enforce stricter observance of Wahhabi rules <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> social behaviour. After his accession to the throne in 2005, King Abdullah took steps to reduce the powers of the ulema, for instance transferring control over girls' education to the Ministry of Education.|$|E

25|$|Bentham's book An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation {{was printed}} in 1780 but not {{published}} until 1789. It {{is possible that}} Bentham was spurred on to publish after he saw the success of Paley's The Principles <b>of</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>and</b> Political Philosophy. Bentham's book was not an immediate success but his ideas were spread further when Pierre Étienne Louis Dumont translated edited selections {{from a variety of}} Bentham's manuscripts into French. Traité de legislation civile et pénale was published in 1802 and then later retranslated back into English by Hildreth as The Theory of Legislation, although by this time significant portions of Dumont's work had already been retranslated and incorporated into Sir John Bowring's edition of Bentham's works, which was issued in parts between 1838 and 1843.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{has a role}} in {{discussing}} the {{issues related to the}} social order. Social and economic issues are vital to her not from a technical point of view but in terms <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> ethical issues involved. Ethical considerations include the nature of private property. Within the Catholic Church several conflicting views had developed. Pope Pius XI declares private property essential for the development and freedom of the individual. Those who deny private property, deny personal freedom and development. But, said Pius, private property has a social function as well. Private property loses its morality, if it is not subordinated to the common good. Therefore, governments have a right to redistribution policies. In extreme cases, the Pope grants the State a right of expropriation of private property.|$|E
25|$|Betting and bookmaking in the 1890s {{need to be}} seen in {{the then}} climate <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> social change in New Zealand. Women's suffrage, temperance and anti-betting were strong movements, and gaming houses were banned, which {{included}} betting shops. Bookmakers responded to the situation by giving themselves titles like 'commission agents' and 'turf accountants'. Parliament was strongly lobbied by the pro-betting faction and consequently left decisions to the local level. Beginning with the Canterbury Trotting Club in 1897, racecourses responded by banning bookmakers from their properties. Those not adhering to the ban were being arrested and fined. Christchurch City Council passed a by-law in 1899 and banned bookmaking in public. Legislation was finally passed in 1908, banning gaming in public places and making it illegal for racing clubs to accept bets by telephone. An amendment to the Gaming Act in 1910 banned bookmaking altogether.|$|E

25|$|In antiquity, pederasty {{was seen}} as an {{educational}} institution for the inculcation <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> cultural values in some cultures, as well as a form of sexual expression. Its practice dates from the Archaic period onwards in Ancient Greece, but Cretan ritual objects that reflect an already-formalised practice date to the late Minoan civilization, in around 1650 BC. According to Plato, in Ancient Greece, pederasty was a relationship and bond, whether sexual or chaste, between an adolescent boy and an adult man outside of his immediate family. While most Greek men engaged in relations with both girls and boys, exceptions to the rule were known, some avoiding relations with women, and others rejecting relations with boys. In Ancient Rome, relations with boys took a more informal and less civic path, men taking advantage of dominant social status to extract sexual favors from their social inferiors or carrying on illicit relationships with freeborn boys.|$|E
25|$|In this way, Wodiczko {{continued}} in his testimonial video projections {{to respond to}} the needs of urban society’s marginal citizens who frequently survive outside the usual boundaries of juridical and social resources. In 2001, he merged the means of his instruments with the purpose of the projections in his Tijuana Projection executed for InSite 2000. In this public intervention, women working in the “maquiladora” industry of Tijuana, Mexico wore media technology designed to project their faces onto El Centro Cultural as they spoke emotionally of incest, police abuse, and work place discrimination in real time. As participants, their parrhesiastic speech was courageously offered at great risk to themselves for the purpose <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> political change. Through the video projections, Wodiczko continues to develop the potential for aesthetic practice to effect social change as part of a wider discourse on agonistic pluralism prompted by such influences as Chantal Mouffe and Ludwig Wittgenstein.|$|E
25|$|The sacred texts {{found in}} Agama Hindu Dharma are the Vedas and Upanishads. They {{are the basis}} of Indian and Balinese Hinduism. Other sources of {{religious}} information include the Universal Hindu Puranas and the Itihasa (mainly Ramayana and the Mahabharata). The epics Mahabharata and Ramayana became enduring traditions among Indonesian believers, expressed in shadow puppet (wayang) and dance performances. As in India, Indonesian Hinduism recognizes four paths of spirituality, calling it Catur Marga. These are bhakti mārga (path of devotion to deities), jnana mārga (path of knowledge), karma mārga (path of works) and raja mārga (path of meditation). Bhakti marga has the largest following in Bali. Similarly, like Hindus in India, Balinese Hindus {{believe that there are}} four proper goals of human life, calling it Catur Purusartha - dharma (pursuit <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> ethical living), artha (pursuit of wealth and creative activity), kama (pursuit of joy and love) and moksha (pursuit of self-knowledge and liberation).|$|E

25|$|Two {{institutions}} may be {{said even}} under the Second Empire to have retained their freedom: the Institute of France and the Protestant Consistory. In both of these Guizot continued to the last {{to take an active}} part. He was a member of three of the five academies into which the Institute of France is divided. The Academy <b>of</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>and</b> Political Science owed its restoration to him, and he became in 1832 one of its first associates. The Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres elected him in 1833 as the successor to Dacier, and in 1836 he was chosen a member of the Académie Française, the highest literary distinction of the country. In these learned bodies Guizot continued for nearly forty years to take a lively interest and to exercise a powerful influence. He was the jealous champion of their independence. His voice had the greatest weight in the choice of new candidates; the younger generation of French writers never looked in vain to him for encouragement, and his constant aim was to maintain the dignity and purity of the profession of letters. In 1842, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.|$|E
25|$|This Bible, {{as indeed}} all the picture Bibles of the Middle Ages, {{did not contain}} {{the full text of}} the Bible, and {{contained}} much original commentary. Short passages only were cited, and these not so as to give any continuous sense or line of thought. But the object of the writer seems to have been chiefly to make the texts cited the basis <b>of</b> <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> allegorical teaching, in the manner so common in those days. In the Psalter he was content with copying out the first verse of each psalm; whilst when dealing with the Gospels he did not quote from each evangelist separately, but made use of a kind of confused diatessaron of all four combined. An attempt was made to establish a connection between the events recorded in the Old Testament and those recorded in the New, even when there {{does not seem to be}} any very obvious connection between them. Thus the sleep of Adam, recorded in the beginning of Genesis, is said to prefigure the death of Christ; and Abraham sending his servant with rich presents to seek a wife for his son is a type of the Eternal Father giving the Gospels to the Apostles to prepare the union of His Son with the Church.|$|E
