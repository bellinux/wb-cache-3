5|$|As {{a lifelong}} Democrat, Beauregard worked to end Republican rule during Reconstruction. His <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{perceived}} excesses of Reconstruction was a principal source for his indecision about {{remaining in the}} United States and his flirtation with foreign armies, which lasted until 1875. He {{was active in the}} Reform Party, an association of conservative New Orleans businessmen, which spoke in favor of civil rights and voting for former slaves, hoping to form alliances between African-Americans and Democrats to vote out the Radical Republicans in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, a {{provision}} in the stimulus package that grandfathered in bonuses paid to executives at troubled insurance giant AIG and other TARP recipients became a campaign issue. Tedisco, who had been criticized by Murphy for opposing the package, used the <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> AIG bonuses to reframe the debate. On March 19, Tedisco called for the resignation of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner over the AIG controversy. Murphy responded by insisting that the stimulus package was necessary for job creation.|$|E
5|$|The {{service is}} also used {{as a form of}} civil disobedience: in 2010, users {{expressed}} <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Twitter Joke Trial by copying a controversial joke about bombing an airport and attaching the hashtag #IAmSpartacus, a reference to the Spartacus film and a sign of solidarity and support to a man controversially prosecuted after posting a tweet joking about bombing an airport if they cancelled his flight. #IAmSpartacus became the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The {{teachers}} of the Engadine in particular were <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> decision, but those in the Surmeir were mostly satisfied. Few opinions were heard from the Surselva, which was interpreted either as support or resignation, depending {{in the viewpoint of}} the observer.|$|R
2500|$|... Prime Minister John Key was <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> attack. He {{called it}} a [...] "despicable {{terrorist}} act" [...] while condemning the attack. He further said {{that he intends to}} convey [...] "a message of condolence to the Sri Lankan Government and Sri Lankan cricket team".|$|R
50|$|Despite Long's {{promises}} of increased social programs, voters were still <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> recent corruption scandals and {{were unwilling to}} believe Earl Long's claims {{that he had had}} nothing to do with the scandals. Jones's victory ended twelve years of Longite governors in Louisiana.|$|R
5|$|In 1965, while {{a student}} at Bennington College, Dworkin was arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest at the United States Mission to the United Nations {{and sent to the}} New York Women's House of Detention. Dworkin testified that the doctors in the House of Detention gave her an {{internal}} examination which was so rough that she bled for days afterwards. She spoke in public and testified before a grand jury about her experience, and the media coverage of her testimony made national and international news. The grand jury declined to make an indictment in the case, but Dworkin's testimony contributed to public <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> mistreatment of inmates. The prison was closed seven years later.|$|E
5|$|The press did {{not cover}} the battle at first, and one Ohio paper misinterpreted Harrison's {{dispatch}} to Eustis to {{mean he was}} defeated. By December, as most major American papers carried stories on the battle, public <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Shawnee attack grew. At a time of high tensions with the United Kingdom, many Americans blamed the British for inciting the tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms. In response, Congress passed resolutions condemning the British for interfering in American domestic affairs. A few months later, on June 18, 1812, the U.S. government declared war against United Kingdom. Shortly thereafter, Harrison left Vincennes to seek a military appointment.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Rangers {{governor}} William Jennings {{introduced to}} his peers {{the idea of}} expanding the league to the American West Coast by adding two new teams for the 1964–65 season. While the governors did not agree to the proposal, the topic of expansion came up every time the owners met from then on out. In 1965, {{it was decided to}} expand by six teams, doubling the size of the NHL. In February 1966, the governors met and decided to award franchises to Los Angeles, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Oakland and St. Louis. The league rejected bids from Baltimore, Buffalo and Vancouver. In Canada, there was widespread <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> denial of an expansion team to Vancouver in 1967; three years later, the NHL awarded a franchise to Vancouver, which formerly played in the Western Hockey League, for the 1970–71 season, along with the Buffalo Sabres.|$|E

50|$|President Anwar Sadat's {{signing of}} the Camp David Accords on 17 September 1978 and his shared 1978 Nobel Peace Prize with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin led to his {{assassination}} by dissatisfied Islamic extremists from within Egypt. <b>The</b> group was <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> president's decision {{to make peace with}} Israel.|$|R
5|$|Kīnaʻu died on September 9, 1859 in Kapaʻau, Kohala {{district}} on {{the island}} of Hawaiʻi. The cause of his death was said to be an accident, although the details are unknown. An accusation of poisoning was forwarded by a noted priest and the whole of Kona became <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> rumors. One source claimed he was killed in a riding accident. While his obituary in the Hawaiian newspapers The Polynesian and The Pacific Commercial Advertiser claimed it was consumption.|$|R
5|$|The Polish {{settlement}} emboldened the Hungarians, {{who decided}} that Moscow could be defied. A mass demonstration in Budapest on 23 October {{turned into a}} popular uprising. In response to the uprising, Hungarian Party leaders installed reformist Premier Imre Nagy. Soviet forces in the city clashed with Hungarians and even fired on demonstrators, with hundreds of both Hungarians and Soviets killed. Nagy called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of Soviet troops, which a Khrushchev-led majority in the Presidium decided to obey, choosing to give the new Hungarian government a chance. Khrushchev assumed that if Moscow announced liberalization in how it dealt with its allies, Nagy would adhere to the alliance with the Soviet Union. However, on 30 October Nagy announced multiparty elections, {{and the next morning}} that Hungary would leave the Warsaw Pact. On 3 November, two members of the Nagy government appeared in Ukraine as the self-proclaimed heads of a provisional government and demanded Soviet intervention, which was forthcoming. The next day, Soviet troops crushed the Hungarian uprising, with a death toll of 4,000 Hungarians and several hundred Soviet troops. Nagy was arrested, and was later executed. Despite the international <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> intervention, Khrushchev defended his actions {{for the rest of his}} life. Damage to Soviet foreign relations was severe, and would have been greater were it not for the fortuitous timing of the Suez crisis, which distracted world attention.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Boorstin’s comment {{prompted}} Senior Republican Senator from Alaska Ted Stevens and Senator Slade Gorton from Washington, {{two senior}} members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, to expresse <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> exhibit and to threaten to cut funding to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} suggests that Hellmuth Reinhard took the initiative {{to put an end}} to all Jews in Norway. This may have been motivated by his own ambition, and it's possible he was encouraged by the lack of <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> initial measures targeting Jews.|$|E
5000|$|He {{performed}} at many Democratic Party rallies and once wrote the theme song/jingle for the [...] "Goodness Grows in North Carolina" [...] program {{that the state}} promoted. In 2010, <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> citations in his district of members of Willie Nelson's band (which led to Nelson cancelling a concert there), Albertson wrote and recorded a song called [...] "Leave the Man Alone" [...] criticizing law enforcement for the incident. It received airplay on several country stations.|$|R
50|$|King Husky III {{was named}} University mascot on September 24, 1952. He served as mascot until {{the summer of}} 1955 when he fell ill and was euthanized. Controversy {{surrounded}} the death of King Husky III as the University did not release information about the animal's death until after students had returned for the fall semester. Students viewed {{the lack of information}} as a cover-up and the editors of the student paper, the Northeastern News, planned to write an inflammatory story which was stopped by <b>the</b> Administration. <b>Outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> perceived censorship, four student editors quit.|$|R
5000|$|... — Ministry of Foreign Affairs {{condemned}} {{the attack and}} release a press release which reads [...] " [...] The Government of the Republic of Korea cannot but be shocked and <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> terrorist attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar in northwestern Pakistan on December 16 that left {{a large number of}} people, including school children, killed or injured. The ROK government prays for the repose of the innocent people killed in the attack and offers its deepest condolences and consolation to their bereaved families as well as the Pakistani people." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the wake}} of Le's {{disappearance}} and the discovery of her body, and the sympathy and <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> crime going worldwide, there was a backlash in some circles to the extensive media coverage, and while most acknowledged the crime was especially heart breaking, some questioned whether the level of interest was warranted.|$|E
25|$|Incessant {{fighting}} {{followed the}} Mukden Incident. In 1932, Chinese and Japanese troops fought the January 28 Incident battle. This {{resulted in the}} demilitarisation of Shanghai, which forbade the Chinese from deploying troops in their own city. In Manchukuo there was an ongoing campaign to defeat the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies that arose from widespread <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> policy of non-resistance to Japan.|$|E
25|$|There was <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> closure plan: critics {{pointed out}} {{that this was a}} main line, not a small branch railway. The {{campaign}} uncovered evidence that British Rail had mounted a dirty tricks campaign against the line, exaggerating the cost of repairs (£6million for Ribblehead Viaduct alone) and diverting traffic away from the line in order to justify its closure plans, a process referred to as closure by stealth.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fatwa {{and death}} threats against Salman Rushdie, Ibn Warraq assumes a {{pseudonym}} to pen what one critic calls [...] "serious and thought-provoking book" [...] using a [...] "sledge-hammer" [...] approach to [...] "demolish" [...] Islam. The author's [...] "polemic" [...] criticizes Islam's mythology, theology, historic achievements, and current cultural influence. Warraq, drawing largely on previous research, provides an [...] "invaluable compilation" [...] of Islam's shortcomings. He [...] "makes a compelling case" [...] that Islam is [...] "flatly incompatible" [...] with [...] "individual rights and liberties of a liberal, democratic, secular state".|$|R
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of conscription in the United States and World War II in the news, the majority of American minor and major film studios made comedies about military service. RKO's Call Out the Marines had a troubled production history with different stars and technicians announced in trade papers of {{the time for the}} film. The United States Marine Corps, which had initially cooperated with <b>the</b> producers, was <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> completed film in December 1941 and ordered the film shelved as [...] "bad for morale". However it was released after America entered the war.|$|R
50|$|On June 4, 2004, Marvin Heemeyer, a local auto muffler shop owner, <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{outcome of}} a zoning dispute, went on a rampage through town, driving a {{modified}} bulldozer. Several buildings were damaged, including a bank, a hardware store, a concrete company, a utility service center, the town hall, the police department, and a former mayor's home. The rampage lasted 2 hours and 7 minutes, ending when the bulldozer got stuck attempting {{to go through the}} alleyway of Gambles Hardware Store. Heemeyer then killed himself with a handgun. No other deaths occurred, but an estimated $7 million in damage was done.|$|R
25|$|In {{the wake}} of public <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact, Browder was indicted for {{passport}} fraud. He was convicted of two counts early in 1940 and sentenced to four years in prison, remaining free for a time on appeal. In the spring of 1942 the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the sentence and Browder began what {{proved to be a}} 14-month stint in federal prison. Browder was subsequently released in 1943 as a gesture towards wartime unity.|$|E
25|$|In the aftermath, {{a number}} of mutineers were hanged and others sentenced to long periods of penal servitude. The 47th Regiment was disbanded and its Indian {{officers}} dismissed, while its European officers were transferred to other regiments. The incident was largely suppressed in the media, with only limited information being {{released to the public}} but public <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> incident resulted in widespread condemnation of the British colonial government. Ordinary British people were especially furious with the government for its heavy-handedness in dealing with the sepoys' grievances.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, Alice Paul was {{appointed}} chair of NAWSA's Congressional Committee {{and charged with}} reviving the drive for a women's suffrage amendment. In 1913, she and her coworker Lucy Burns organized a suffrage parade in Washington {{on the day before}} Woodrow Wilson's inauguration as president. Opponents of the march turned the event into a near riot, which ended only when a cavalry unit of the army was brought in to restore order. Public <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> incident, which cost the chief of police his job, brought publicity to the movement and gave it fresh momentum.|$|E
5000|$|On April 29, 1975, in a [...] "personal privileges" [...] {{speech on}} the floor of the Louisiana House, Guidry, {{considered}} a Conservative Democrat, decried the communist takeover of the former South Vietnam. He became so <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> turn of fortunes against the United States in Southeast Asia that he questioned whether the country could survive until its 300th birthday. Guidry said that voters have the mentality of [...] "a fourteen-year-old". He suggested that actress Jane Fonda and former Black Panthers figure Eldridge Cleaver, before the latter's conversion to conservatism, were [...] "re-gloating and celebrating" [...] the communist triumph.|$|R
5|$|Bowen was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} story of the relocated wolves after becoming <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> continued poaching of wolves in the protected areas of Ninemile Valley. She spent four years researching wolves while working on the novel. In recounting the fates of the animals at the end, she expresses hope in the ideals behind efforts to restore wolf populations. Nominated for a 2006 Teens' Top Ten award by the American Library Association, the novel was praised by critics. Two praised Bowen's ability to avoid anthropomorphism while capturing the essence of wolf behavior and life. Another also praised the story's highlighting of the difficulties in wolf relocation programs.|$|R
50|$|The Drakh held {{control of}} Centauri Prime {{for the next}} 17 years, and molded it as an {{instrument}} of vengeance against the Alliance. They successfully managed to take control of David Sheridan on his 16th birthday, and he journeyed to Centauri Prime at their command; Delenn and Sheridan pursued him in a rescue attempt, and were captured. Acting as an outside agent, Ambassador Vir Cotto destroyed the Drakh's primary installation, thus exposing the Drakh to the rest of <b>the</b> Alliance. <b>Outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> defiance, the Drakh detonated the fusion bombs, killing millions of Centauri, prompting Londo to betray them by releasing the Sheridan family and assisting their escape. To ensure their success, he enlisted the help of his friend G'kar to kill him before his intoxicated Keeper awoke; the Keeper unfortunately recovered in time to retaliate, and both men strangled each other.|$|R
25|$|On August 6, the Committee of Detail {{reported}} its proposed {{revisions to}} the Randolph Plan. Again the question of slavery came up, and again the question was met with attacks of <b>outrage.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> next two weeks, delegates wove a web of mutual compromises relating to commerce and trade, east and west, slave-holding and free. The transfer of power to regulate slave trade from states to central government could happen in 20 years, but only then. Later generations could try out their own answers. The delegates {{were trying to make}} a government that might last that long.|$|E
25|$|The {{perpetrators}} were Chrysler {{plant superintendent}} Ronald Ebens and his stepson, Michael Nitz. The lenient sentencing {{of these two}} men in a plea bargain generated public <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> murder attack, which included blows to the head from a baseball bat, and possessed attributes consistent with hate crimes. Many of the layoffs in Detroit's auto industry, including Nitz's in 1979, had been due to the increasing market share of Japanese automakers, particularly due to Chrysler's increased sales of captively-imported Mitsubishi models rebadged and sold under the Dodge and now-defunct Plymouth brands, leading to allegations that Vincent Chin received racially charged comments attributing to the layoffs while being beaten.|$|E
25|$|On 2 January 2002, {{a police}} team led by SP Kulasiri Udugampola raided an LRRP safehouse in Athurugiriya, a suburb close to the capital, Colombo. The unit was accused of {{planning}} to assassinate leaders of the recently elected United National Party government. Six personnel were arrested, including Captain Nilam, {{the leader of the}} unit. Four soldiers and a former LTTE cadre were also arrested. In addition, a number of weapons were taken into custody, including explosives, anti-tank and thermobaric weapons. Details of this raid and the weapons were made public through media. Attempts by the military hierarchy to get the arrested personnel released failed, and Army commander Lt. Gen. Lionel Balagalla issued a public statement revealing the true nature of this unit. The arrested personnel were released only after interrogation on 13 January, under orders from Defence Minister Tilak Marapana, who expressed <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> police raid.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, a {{memorandum}} {{was drafted by}} the solicitor for the United States Department of the Interior, which looked at {{the wording of the}} Endangered Species Act. Specifically, the paper considered the meaning of the phrase [...] "significant portion of its range". The memorandum detailed that the previous range of a species under the ESA was unimportant and that the current range of such a species was what was important, not what it [...] "historically occupied". A number of environmental groups were <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> memorandum, as the density of species under their current range would end up with many taken off the Endangered Species List, even if the population was far lower than what would be considered stable.|$|R
5000|$|Annemarie Eilfeld {{demanded a}} redo {{after she was}} {{eliminated}} in the Top 3 show. RTL admitted that a speaker in the “reminder” trailers following the show had told viewers to vote 03 for Annemarie Eilfeld and 02 for Daniel Schuhmacher. She called this problem a [...] "scandal". The mistake wasn't big enough for RTL to bother with. After the initial show Annemarie Eilfeld had 19.3% of the vote and ended up with 19.8% with the second place contestant receiving a much higher total. Angry DSDS fans complained and demanded either {{a repeat of the}} Top 3 show or a three-way final between Annemarie Eilfeld, Daniel Schuhmacher and Sarah Kreuz. Annemarie Eilfeld's father was <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> error and reportedly considering taking legal action against RTL.|$|R
5000|$|This caused Jean-Marie Balestre and the FISA to {{immediately}} freeze {{the development of}} the Group B cars and ban them from competing for the 1987 season. Audi and Ford decided to withdraw from competing, while other teams continued with their Group B models {{until the end of the}} season. Peugeot boss Jean Todt was <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ban and pursued legal action against the federation. The Tour de Corse was eventually won by Peugeot's Bruno Saby, which marked his career-first WRC victory. The Acropolis Rally in Greece and the New Zealand Rally were won consecutively by Kankunnen; and the third driver to take his debut win during the season was Lancia's Miki Biasion, who edged out teammate Alén to win the Rally Argentina.|$|R
