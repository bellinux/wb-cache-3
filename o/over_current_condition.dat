Owing to the incessant damages done by fluctuations in the power supply, there is urgent need to address the problem through other alternatives, which give birth to design and construction of an equipment to protect the connected loads against under and/over voltage and over current conditions. Under/over voltage and over current protection is essential between supply terminal and the appliances (connected loads).|$|E

40|$|Postmodern {{theory has}} problematized the {{concepts}} {{and concerns of}} Marxism with respect to socialist praxis. One of the most diligent examples of this engagement comes from Jean Baudrillard’s simulation theory. Pronouncing the death of Marxist categories, such as depth and revolution, simulation theory offers an aleatory, indeterminate model of society where the real implodes into the hyperreal. With {{special attention to the}} concept of resistance, this essay assesses the conceptual framework of both simulation and socialist theory for their promises and problems in the context of postmodernity. Bringing historical materialism into dialogue with simulation theory reasserts the importance of Marxism in addressing the unfinished project of social emancipation. There is much to suggest that with the real becoming hyperreal, exploitation intensifies into hyperexploitation. In short, notwithstanding the merits of simulation theory, Marxist concepts and concerns are still central to both radical theory and praxis. Bringing the merits of simulation theory to Marxism offers a social theory of meaning in the context of capitalism. “Resisting Capital: Simulationist and Socialist Strategies” In the second millennium, social theorists are in a mad dash to construct new ways of explaining the shifting terrains of social life.

As part of this investigation, a water budget of the central and west Maui region was computed from which (1) historic ground-water recharge was estimated and (2) the effects of agricultural land use and drought were analyzed. Estimated annual ground-water recharge decreased 44 percent from 1979 to 2004 in central and west Maui Reduction in agricultural irrigation, resulting from more efficient irrigation methods and reduction in agricultural land, is largely responsible for declining recharge. Recently, periods of lower-than-average rainfall have had an exacerbating effect.

One of the main ways to achieve this is {{the protection of the}} system which needs to be fast, reliable and cost effective. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide protection of equipments in low voltage (LV) distribution system and thereafter to avoid their failure due to abnormal operating conditions. The proposed device provides protection for industrial, commercial and residential equipments by monitoring under voltage, over voltage and <b>over</b> <b>current</b> <b>conditions</b> using microcontroller, transistor and other discrete components. The microcontroller is the heart of this protective device which performs the major control of the device. The designed circuit can withstand the loads and the set voltage range so as to supply the connected load for any voltage variation between 220 and 240 Volts. It can be used to protect loads such as refrigerator, TV, VCR/DVD player etc. against undesirable over and under voltage conditions as well as surges caused due to sudden failure of power supply mains. This device can also be used directly as standalone equipment between the supply mains and the load. The over/under voltage and <b>over</b> <b>current</b> cut-off with time delay provides over/under-voltage and <b>over</b> <b>current</b> protection and also protection against any transients.|$|R

40|$|The CAT 3211 is an H−Bridge {{motor driver}} IC that {{includes}} an I 2 C programmable haptic generator state machine, internal oscillator and adjustable LDO voltage regulator, {{all in one}} compact solution. Two operating modes are supported: haptic mode (triggered via H_TRIG pin or register) and vibrator mode (VIB_EN pin or register). H−TRIG triggers a haptic sequence where Forward, Coast, Reverse and Recovery time durations are controlled. All four timer durations are configured via I 2 C interface registers. The LDO output voltage supplying the H−Bridge can be programmed from 2. 0 V to 5. 0 V or shorted to VIN (using LDOH register). This allows the motor to be safely overdriven for short durations, greatly increasing the user experience. Driving VIB_EN high sets the H−Bridge to forward direction and LDO voltage to a predefined vibrator setting (using LDOV register). The motor can be continuously and safely driven at low voltages in vibrator mode.

The Spaceliner Investment Area plans to mature vehicle technologies to reduce the implementation risks for future commercially developed reusable launch vehicles (RLV). The plan is to substantially increase the design and operating margins of the third generation RLV (the Space Shuttle is the first generation) by incorporating advanced technologies in propulsion, materials, structures, thermal protection systems, avionics, and power. Advancements in design tools and better characterization of the operational environment will allow improvements in design margins. Improvements in operational efficiencies will be provided through use of advanced integrated health management, operations, and range technologies. The increase in margins will allow components to operate well below their design points resulting in improved component operating life, reliability, and safety which in turn reduces both maintenance and refurbishment costs. These technologies have the potential of enabling horizontal takeoff by reducing the takeoff weight and achieving the goal of airline-like operation. These factors in conjunction with increased flight rates from an expanding market will result in significant improvements in safety and reductions in operational costs of future vehicles.

40|$|How do {{political}} institutions affect violent conflict in divided societies? I argue that where identity-group divisions are highly politically salient, {{the extent to}} which marginalized groups are included in key government institutions affects individuals' motives for turning to violence. Integrating government from the "bottom-up," i. e. via the rank-and-file of institutions responsible for implementing policies and enforcing laws, addresses incentives for fighting. 	I test this theory of bottom-up integration in the context of one critical policy-implementing institution, the police, and in two divided societies, Iraq and Israel. Using a combination original survey data, new data on police officer demographics, interviews, and a priming experiment, I show that individuals who perceive the police as integrated are less willing to consider using violence against the government. I demonstrate that police integration reduces grievances <b>over</b> <b>current</b> <b>conditions,</b> including biases in police service provision and exclusion from desirable employment, as well of fears of future mistreatment by the police and government. 	One of the key arguments is that institutional inclusiveness comes in many forms, and different configurations of inclusiveness predict different outcomes. For example, I demonstrate that integration, in which police officers from all groups work side by side to serve citizens from all groups, dramatically reduces fears of future repression among vulnerable minorities. On the other hand, local-level autonomy, in which citizens are policed by members of their own group, has no such effect. I suggest that the difference lies in the mechanisms integration provides to marginalized groups to impose costs on the state or the dominant group in the future. More generally, institutional inclusiveness matters not as an end unto itself but as a means for balancing power and affecting governance. 	This dissertation speaks to the importance of institutions tasked with interpreting, implementing, and enforcing government policies. Institutional solutions to conflict cannot be limited to institutions which select leaders or make laws; they must also consider institutions that enforce the laws. By addressing a critical link in the chain of governance, bottom-up integration confronts the root causes that motivate fighting along sectarian lines...|$|R

40|$|Advancement of High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) {{materials}} {{has increased}} interest {{in research and development}} of superconducting transformers. One of the challenges in the design and development of HTS transformer is the modelling of load flow, system losses and <b>over</b> <b>current</b> phenomena to be experienced by the transformer. Even though HTS technology is claimed to offer better power system and other packaging benefits, the performance and reliability need to be proven and verified through the proper modelling of power system network. The study set up the electrical characteristics of a HTS transformer. The parameters need to be validated before any effort is to carry out to model the behaviour of a distribution network under a range of conditions. The characteristics is then adapted into existing network models and analysed under various system loading and <b>over</b> <b>current</b> <b>conditions.</b> The modelling is carried out on a three phase distribution feeder which is inherently unbalanced. The technical information on the HTS transformer is based on a preliminary baseline design. The exploration is intended to establish the performance of HTS transformers in comparison with that of conventional transformers. The short circuit design of a transformer {{is one of the most}} significant and challenging criteria. Additional generating capacity and interconnections due to the growth of electrical power demand have contributed to an increase in short circuit capacity of power networks. One of the consequences is that the short circuit duty to be undertaken by transformers becomes more severe. The short circuit strength of a transformer is designed to withstand through fault currents due to external short circuit. Any weakness in the strength may result in a mechanical collapse of windings and deformation to clamping structures. The internal faults initiated by the external short circuits may lead to bushing blowouts, tank bursting, fire hazard, etc. Meanwhile, the inrush current of a transformer can be as high as seven to ten times the rated current. Inrush current events are more frequent compared to short circuits. They also last for much longer time (few seconds) compared to short circuits (tens of milliseconds). The users are very anxious about the repeated switching of a transformer. Even though the inrush currents are usually not seriously looked into in the mechanical design considerations, the forces generated due to an extensive number of switching in a day may weaken the winding over a period of time. The continuous occurrences may lead to winding looseness and subsequent failure. The active development of HTS materials has led to extensive research and development studies of superconducting transformers worldwide. Considerable benefits have been accomplished with the introduction of HTS transformer such as reduced power loss, size and transformer weight. This study focuses on modelling the effects of various distribution network conditions towards a distribution HTS transformer and looks comprehensively into the thermal effects of short circuit current on various architectural designs and fault current limiting properties of HTS transformer winding conductor. Recent advancement in the design technology has looked into the HTS transformer’s ability to also perform as Fault Current Limiter (FCL). This study presents the computation of the thermal effects of short circuit currents on a non-FCL HTS transformer and demonstrates how it will behave with a HTS-FCL winding conductor...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} new late Holocene relative sea-level reconstructions in the Humber Estuary, {{and examines}} {{the relationship between}} sea-level change and the salinisation of the groundwater resource. Relative sea-level reconstructions were produced using lithological and biostratigraphical analyses from two sites. Single and multi-proxy transfer functions were developed using diatom and foraminifera training sets from three sites in the Humber Estuary, with the multi-proxy transfer function providing the best performance. However, {{the application of the}} transfer functions was limited by the availability of modern analogues and generally poor preservation of microfossils. Eight new sea-level index points were produced, providing constraints of relative sea-level change between 4022 - 1470 cal years BP. The reconstructions were consistent with existing data, offering new constraints for the previously identified expansion and contraction of estuarine conditions during the late Holocene. In the outer estuary, two sea-level index points provided a record for an expansion between 3395 - 3227 cal years BP not previously constrained by sea-level index points. In the inner estuary, the sea-level index points indicated an expansion of estuarine conditions at 4022 cal years BP. Two of the points now provide the youngest constraints for the inner estuary. Multiple sea level and groundwater abstraction scenarios for time periods in the past and future were undertaken using a numerical model. These determined the contribution of sea level and abstraction to changes in the groundwater and saline intrusion; sea-level rise increased saline waters within the aquifer, and abstraction induced additional saline intrusion. Future sea-level rise will also result in an increase in aquifer salinity.
