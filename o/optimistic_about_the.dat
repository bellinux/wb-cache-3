5|$|After retiring, Christopher {{moved to}} San Diego, {{where he lived}} with his wife and three children. In December 1950, Christopher {{underwent}} heart surgery, and afterward felt <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> possibility of pitching again. After a tryout with the Indians in 1951, he joined the San Diego Padres for a salary of $1 a year. He spent several weeks training with the team, but was eventually released at the end of April, ending his comeback attempt.|$|E
5|$|Hurley finds {{beer in the}} van and a {{returned}} Sawyer outside. He learns from Sawyer that he and Kate escaped but Jack {{is still}} prisoner. Hurley is very <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future and volunteers Sawyer to help him fix the van. Meanwhile, Desmond refuses to tell Charlie when he will die. Kate informs Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) of all she knows about the Others and then leaves, saying she's going to get help to rescue Jack, but she won't say from whom.|$|E
5|$|By September 1943, {{the values}} of the D-D and T-D had been revised upwards, raising hopes that a fusion {{reaction}} could be started at lower temperatures. Teller was sufficiently <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Super, and sufficiently concerned about reports that the Germans were interested in deuterium, to ask the Governing Board to raise its priority. The board agreed to some extent, but ruled that only one person could be spared to work on it full-time. Oppenheimer designated Konopinski, who would {{spend the rest of the}} war working on it. Nonetheless, in February 1944, Teller added Stanislaw Ulam, Jane Roberg, Geoffrey Chew, and Harold and Mary Argo to his T-1 Group. Ulam calculated the inverse Compton cooling, while Roberg worked out the ignition temperature of T-D mixtures. Maria Goeppert joined the group in February 1945.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the Vietnam War, Lê Duẩn took an {{aggressive}} posture. He saw attack {{as the key}} to victory. When the North finally won the war in 1975, Lê Duẩn and his associates were overly <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future. The Second Five-Year Plan (1976–1980) was a failure and left the Vietnamese economy in crisis. Vietnam was then headed by a gerontocracy (in which the rulers are much older than the average adult). Vietnam became internationally isolated during Lê Duẩn's rule. In 1979 the country had invaded Kampuchea and ousted Pol Pot, fought a war with China and became dependent on Soviet economic aid. Lê Duẩn died in July 1986 and was succeeded by Trường Chinh.|$|E
5|$|It was {{difficult}} for crew members to perceive the film's quality {{during much of the}} production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design. Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially, but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting. According to Lee Unkrich, one of the original editors of Toy Story, a scene was cut out of the original final edit. The scene features Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently. Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the creators of the movie thought the audience would be loving Buzz and Woody at that point. Another scene, where Woody was trying to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie. Peter Schneider had grown <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film as it neared completion, and announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.|$|E
5|$|The {{sections}} of the International that recognised {{the leadership of the}} International Secretariat remained <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> possibilities for increasing the International's political influence and extended the entrism into social democratic parties which was already underway in Britain, Austria and elsewhere. The 1954 congress emphasised entrism into communist parties and nationalist parties in the colonies, pressing for democratic reforms, ostensibly to encourage the left-wing they perceived to exist in the communist parties to join with them in a revolution. Tensions developed between those who subscribed to the mainstream views of Pablo and a minority that argued unsuccessfully against open work. A number of these delegates walked out of the World Congress, and would eventually leave the International, including the leader of the new British section, John Lawrence, George Clarke, Michele Mestre (a leader of the French section), and Murray Dowson (a leader of the Canadian group).|$|E
50|$|The poll of the NATO countries, {{conducted}} in June 2009, about 2 {{months before the}} Afghan election, also reported that 56% of Americans were <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> stabilizing <b>the</b> situation in Afghanistan, whereas the majority 62% {{of people in the}} 12 NATO countries in Europe and Turkey were not.|$|R

25|$|Trump and Obama {{frequently}} communicated {{during the}} transition period, and Trump stated that he sought Obama's advice regarding presidential appointments. However, President-elect Trump also criticized some of Obama's actions, including Obama's refusal to veto a UN Resolution condemning Israel settlements. In his farewell address, Obama expressed concerns about a divisive political environment, economic inequality, and racism, but remained <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to {{some poor}} weather and some {{resolute}} Australian batting {{on the last}} day the Test was a draw, leaving the teams 0–0.

Lindsay Hassett said it wasn't the best team England had sent to Australia, but no other tried so hard to make cricket interesting.|$|E
25|$|Political {{analysts were}} <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> selection. It {{was seen as}} a {{successful}} attempt to shore up support for the Transitional Federal Government both among the diaspora and within the country. Sharmarke was considered someone who could potentially bridge the gap between the various groups currently competing for influence in Somalia, as he was based abroad and thus not tied to local politics. Sharmarke's appointment was also seen by some analysts as an attempt to secure the favor of the large Darod clan, whose Majeerteen branch both Sharmarke and the outgoing President of Somalia, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, are members of.|$|E

25|$|From {{the end of}} the Great Depression {{until the}} early 1970s, Keynesian {{economics}} provided the main inspiration for economic policy makers in Western industrialized countries. The influence of Keynes's theories waned in the 1970s, due to stagflation and critiques from Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, Robert Lucas, Jr. and other economists, who were less <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> ability of interventionist government policy to positively regulate the economy or otherwise opposed to Keynesian policies. From the early 1980s to 2008, the normative consensus among economists was that attempts at fiscal stimulus would be ineffective even in a recession, and such policies were only occasionally employed by the governments of developed countries.|$|E
25|$|In March 2000, Confinity {{merged with}} X.com, an online banking company founded by Elon Musk. Musk was <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future {{success of the}} money {{transfer}} business Confinity was developing. Musk and then-president and CEO of X.com, Bill Harris, disagreed on this point and Harris left the company in May 2000. In October of that year, Musk {{made the decision that}} X.com would terminate its other Internet banking operations and focus on the PayPal money service. The X.com company was then renamed PayPal in 2001, and expanded rapidly throughout the year until company executives decided to take PayPal public in 2002. Paypal's IPO listed under the ticker PYPL at $13 per share and ended up generating over $61 million.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, Montreal {{experienced}} a tremendous economic boom. Massive construction projects, including the Montreal Metro and those {{linked with the}} hosting of Expo 67, brought the city international status. More and more visitors were arriving to the city, especially by airplane but not always by choice. The federal government required European airlines to make Montreal their only Canadian destination. That resulted in 15–20% annual growth in passenger traffic at the city's Dorval Airport. <b>Optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> city's future and its continuing ability to attract more and more visitors, government officials decided {{to build a new}} airport that would be more than able to absorb increased passenger traffic well into the 21st century.|$|E

25|$|Roosevelt's {{attacks on}} Wilson helped the Republicans win control of Congress in the off-year {{elections}} of 1918. He declined {{a request from}} New York Republican to run for another gubernatorial term, but attacked Wilson's Fourteen Points, calling instead for the unconditional surrender of Germany. He was cautiously <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> proposed League of Nations, but had reservations about its impact on United States sovereignty. Roosevelt was popular enough to contest the 1920 Republican nomination, but his health was broken by 1918 due to the lingering effects of malaria. His family and supporters threw their support behind Roosevelt's old military companion, General Leonard Wood, but Taft supporter Warren G. Harding defeated Wood on the tenth ballot of the 1920 Republican National Convention.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of its {{contribution}} to Allied victory in the First World War, Canada became more assertive and less deferential to British authority. Convinced that Canada had proven itself on the battlefields of Europe, Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden demanded that it have a separate seat at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. This was initially opposed not only by Britain but also by the United States, which saw such a delegation as an extra British vote. Borden responded by pointing out that since Canada had lost nearly 60,000 men, a far larger proportion of its men, its right to equal status as a nation had been consecrated on the battlefield. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George eventually relented, and convinced the reluctant Americans to accept the presence of delegations from Canada, India, Australia, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and South Africa. These also received their own seats in the League of Nations. Canada asked for neither reparations nor mandates. It played only a modest role at Paris, but just having a seat was a matter of pride. It was cautiously <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> new League of Nations, in which it played an active and independent role.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Wolf {{replaced}} Rhodes with Mike Sherman. Sherman {{had never}} been a head coach at any level of football and was relatively unknown in NFL circles. He had only coached in professional football for three years starting as the Packers' tight ends coach in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, he followed Mike Holmgren to Seattle and became the Seahawks' offensive coordinator, although Sherman did not call the plays during games. Despite Sherman's apparent anonymity, Wolf was blown away in the interview process by the coach's organizational skills and attention to detail. Sherman's inaugural season started slowly, but the Packers won their final four games to achieve a 9–7 record. Brett Favre praised the atmosphere Sherman had cultivated in Green Bay's locker room and fans were <b>optimistic</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> team's future. In the offseason, however, Wolf suddenly announced his own resignation as GM to take effect after the April 2001 draft. Packers President Bob Harlan was surprised by Wolf's decision and felt unsure of how to replace him. Harlan preferred the structure Green Bay had employed since 1991; a general manager who ran football operations and hired a subservient head coach. But with the momentum and locker room chemistry that was built during the 2000 season, Harlan was reluctant to bring in a new individual with a potentially different philosophy. Wolf recommended that Harlan give the job to Sherman. Though Harlan was wary of the structure in principle, he agreed with Wolf that it was the best solution. In 2001, Sherman assumed the duties of both GM and head coach.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1981, Teller and Wood {{traveled}} to Washington {{to present the}} technology to the policy makers and request greater financial support to pursue the development.
