5000|$|The {{convenience}} of online shopping {{is used to}} counter purchasing behavior known as [...] "show-rooming", where customers examine the products in-store and purchase from another retailer online.

Leveraging the credibility and scale of Yodobashi Camera with the delivery service means small e-commerce websites cannot compete and the nuisance of show-rooming is converted into actual sales for Yodobashi Camera.

More importantly from a logistic perspective our model incorporates any products from any online vendors broadening the range beyond listed items found in any traditional <b>online</b> <b>supermarkets.</b> Data collected via phone survey and analysed via structural equation modelling suggest that the offer of online premium products significantly affects consumers' delivery logistics expectations. We discuss logistics operations and business management implications, identifying the emerging geography of logistic models which respond to consumers' unmet expectations using multiple sourcing and consolidation points...|$|R

40|$|Introduction As {{a result}} of the Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations and Tobacco Products Directive, all packs of {{cigarettes}} (factory-made and hand-rolled) in the United Kingdom must be drab brown, display pictorial warnings on the principal display areas, and contain no less than 20 cigarettes or 30 grams of tobacco. The legislation was phased in between May 2016 and May 2017. Our objective was to monitor pack, brand and product changes pre- and post-implementation.   Methods Our surveillance of the cigarette market involved a review of the trade press, a monthly monitor of <b>online</b> <b>supermarkets,</b> and regular visits to stores, from May 2015 to June 2017.   Results Pre-standardised packaging there were changes to the pack graphics (e. g. redesigned packs and limited-editions) and pack structure (e. g. re-sealable inner foil), and the issue of a number of re-usable tins. Post-standardised packaging, changes included newer cigarette pack sizes for some brand variants (e. g. 23 and 24 packs). Changes to the branding pre-standardised packaging included brand extensions, and post-standardised packaging included brand and/or variant name change, often with the inclusion of colour descriptors, and brand migrations. Product changes pre-standardised packaging included the introduction of novel filters (e. g. filters with two flavour-changing capsules, tube filters, firmer filters, and filters with granular additives). There was non-compliance with the legislation, with slim packs, which are not permitted, on sale after standardised packaging was implemented.   Conclusions Our findings highlight the need to monitor developments in markets introducing standardised packaging, and have policy implications for countries considering this measure...|$|R

We follow the literature that deals with search costs in the grocery market and estimate those costs for two baskets of goods: one that includes frequently purchased products (beverages, breakfast and cereals, dairy products, pantry, and personal care and household) and another that includes only alcoholic drinks (beer, wine, and spirits), which we assume is purchased less frequently. Each basket includes identical products (at the bar-code level) in all stores. Yet {{to the extent that}} online grocery chains remain heterogeneous in terms of reputation and/or range and level of services, the baskets cannot be viewed as homogeneous products.|$|R
