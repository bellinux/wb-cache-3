5|$|Four {{families}} of river dolphins (Iniidae, Pontoporiidae, Lipotidae and Platanistidae) are currently recognized, comprising three superfamilies (Inioidea, Lipotoidea and Platanistoidea). Platanistidae, containing the two subspecies of South Asian river dolphin, {{is the only}} accepted family of Platanistoidea. Previously, many taxonomists had assigned all river dolphins to a single family, Platanistidae, and treated the Ganges and Indus River dolphins as separate species. A December 2006 survey found no members of Lipotes vexillifer (commonly known as the baiji, <b>or</b> <b>Chinese</b> river dolphin) and declared the species functionally extinct. With their disappearance, one of the recently accepted superfamilies, Lipotoidea, has become extinct.|$|E

5|$|Mandarin and Malay, in particular, {{the local}} variety of Malay, that is, Sarawakian Malay or Bahasa Sarawak, are widely spoken here. English is spoken to some extent, with most Mirians being {{incapable}} of speaking English with impeccable grammar. The respective ethnic groups also speak their own languages. Indigenous groups speak languages such as Berawan, Bruneian/Kedayan, Miriek, Iban, Bidayuh, Kayan, Kenyah, and Kelabit. Meanwhile, the Chinese would speak Mandarin, Hakka Chinese, Cantonese, Teochew dialect, Hainanese, and the Fuzhou dialect. However, {{the younger generation}} in Miri tends to use lingua francas (Mandarin and Malay) rather than their indigenous languages (such as Kayan and Kelabit), {{with the exception of}} Iban, which is widely used here, <b>or</b> <b>Chinese</b> dialects (Hokkien and Foochow), and an effort has been made to promote the usage of indigenous languages among the younger generation.|$|E

5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} {{in the mind of}} the Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican <b>or</b> <b>Chinese</b> race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E
