30|$|It is {{well-known}} that rectifiers are used widely in many applications required AC/DC transformation. With technological advances, many studies are performed for AC/DC converters and many control methods are proposed {{in order to}} improve the performance of these rectifiers in recent years. Pulse width modulation (PWM) based rectifiers {{are one of the most}} popular rectifier types. PWM rectifiers have lower input current harmonics and higher power factor compared to classical diode and thyristor rectifiers. In this study, neuro-fuzzy controller (NFC) which has robust, nonlinear structure and do not require the mathematical model of the system to be controlled has been proposed for PWM rectifiers. Three NFCs are used in control scheme of proposed PWM rectifier in order to control the dq-axis currents and DC voltage of PWM rectifier. Moreover, simulation studies are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed control scheme at MATLAB/Simulink environment in terms of rise time, settling time, <b>overshoot,</b> power <b>factor,</b> total harmonic distortion and power quality.|$|R

30|$|To {{maintain}} the desired temperature of 37 °C within a perfusion culture container a heating plate (MEDAX-Nagel, Kiel, Germany) and a cover lid (not shown) is used (Figure 2 d). The transport of culture medium is best accomplished using a slowly rotating peristaltic pump (ISMATEC, IPC N 8, Wertheim, Germany), which {{is able to}} provide adjustable pump rates of 0.1 to 5 ml per hour. In personal experiments medium was transported with 1.25 ml/h {{for a period of}} at least 13 days. Adherent cells growing on a mounted tissue carrier are supplied with always fresh medium flowing from the storage bottle to the container. Thus, during long term culture the growing tissue is exposed to always fresh medium preventing in parallel an un-physiological accumulation of metabolic products and an <b>overshoot</b> of paracrine <b>factors.</b> To maintain this controlled environment for the whole culture period, the metabolized medium is not re-circulated but collected in a separate waste bottle.|$|R
40|$|New Economic Geography (NEG) {{models are}} {{difficult}} to confront with the data, since "on the one hand, they generally emphasise the unleashing of agglomeration forces after trade liberalisation, {{but on the other}} hand, they also accomodate multiple equilibria and non-monotonicity" (Brülhart, 1998 a). In this paper, we show that once factor proportions are fully taken into account in a standard NEG model, the indeterminacy arising from multiple equilibria becomes less severe, and non-monotonicy arises as the most general implication of this literature. We further show that, although trade integration among similar countries ultimately leads to factor price equalisation, agglomeration economies imply an <b>overshooting</b> of relative <b>factor</b> prices with respect to their free trade level in the process of economic integration. Finally, we show that the joint interaction of factor proportions and agglomeration economies may help explain the simultaneous rise in production specialisation and fall in trade specialisation experienced by most European countries in the last decades.

30|$|In conclusion, {{compared}} to other perfusion culture experiments the presently described system exhibits up to date unique features for the generation of specialized tissues. Damage during culture and transfer of growing tissue is prevented by applied MINUSHEET® tissue carriers (Figure 1). Adhesion of cells to natural extracellular matrix or synthetic biomaterials can be modulated by mounting individual supports (Figure 1 a-c). While seeding of cells and initial culture can be performed in the static environment of a 24 well culture plate (Figure 1 d), the exact positioning of a carrier within a perfusion container {{makes it possible to}} provide developing tissue with always fresh medium (Figure 2 a). It prevents an <b>overshoot</b> of paracrine <b>factors</b> and keeps concentration of harmful metabolites low. Finally, offering different media at the luminal and basal side within a gradient culture container allows simulation of a natural barrier environment for epithelia (Figure 2 b). Thus, the described technique bridges consequently static culture in a conventional 24 well plate (Figure 1 d) with modern perfusion culture in different perfusion culture containers (Figure 2).|$|R
40|$|Most economies {{experience}} {{episodes of}} persistent real exchange rate appreciation, {{when the question}} arises {{whether there is a}} need for intervention to protect the export sector. In this pa-per we present a model of irreversible export destruction where exchange rate intervention may be justified if the export sector is financially constrained. However the criterion for intervention is not whether there are bankruptcies or not, but whether these can cause a large exchange rate <b>overshooting</b> once the <b>factors</b> behind the appreciation subside. The optimal policy includes ex-ante and ex-post interventions. Ex-ante (i. e., during the appreciation phase) intervention are limited while financial resources in the export sector are relatively abundant. In this case the bulk of the intervention takes place ex-post, and is concentrated in the first period of the de-preciation phase. In constrast, if the financial constraint in the export sector is tight, the policy is reallocated toward ex-ante intervention and it is optimal to lean against the appreciation. On the methodological front, the solution approach should be useful in other optimal dynamic intervention problems with financially constrained agents...|$|R
40|$|We {{suggest that}} Hamiltonian matrix {{elements}} between physical states in QCD might be approximated, in Coulomb gauge, by "lattice-improved" tree diagrams; i. e. tree diagram contributions with dressed ghost, transverse gluon, and Coulomb propagators obtained from lattice simulations. Such matrix elements {{can be applied}} to a truncated-basis treatment of hadronic states which include constituent gluons. As an illustration, we apply this hybrid approach to the heavy quark potential, for quark-antiquark separations up to 2. 4 fm. The Coulomb string tension in SU(3) gauge theory is about a factor of four times greater than the asymptotic string tension. In our approach we show that a single constituent gluon is in principle sufficient, up to 2. 4 fm, to reduce this <b>overshoot</b> by the <b>factor</b> required. The static potential remains linear, although the precise value of the string tension depends on details of the Couloumb gauge ghost and gluon propagators in the infrared regime. In this connection we present new lattice results for the transverse gluon propagator in position space. Comment: 18 pages, 14 figures. Revisions: use of an expanded basis of states, with a ghost propagator obtained from previous lattice studie...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a methodology of designing a velocity control {{system for a}} DC motor servo drive that is widely used in CNC power transmission systems. There are presented both: the algorithm for tuning the velocity controller for a specified value of overshoot and a fuzzy-logic based tuning of PID controller procedure. Usage of a method called PID-OVR, which ensures the assumed overshoot in a control loop, allows one to chose initial settings of the controller. This algorithm is used with assumptions that the load of motor is equal to zero and that the electrical Tem and mechanical Tmm parameters (time constants) are known accurately. Since all this parameters are always encumbered with errors and the load torque of motor during its work is greater than zero the initially assumed controller settings may not ensure well enough quality of the velocity regulation. <b>Overshoot</b> and damping <b>factor</b> of a step response in a velocity control loop, both of these parameters are used in a fuzzy-logic based tuning of PID controller procedure. This procedure do not require any active identification experiments to be carried out, thanks to which the control performance is not affected...|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} shown that the static {{environment}} within a 24 well culture plate leads to a decrease of nutrition and hormones, an uncontrollable increase of metabolites and an <b>overshoot</b> of paracrine <b>factors</b> during time. Due to these reasons a Minusheet tissue carrier with adherent cells is used only for the short period of cell seeding in a 24 well culture plate.In consequence, after adhesion of cells the tissue carrier is transferred to a perfusion culture container to offer a dynamic fluid environment. To meet the individual requirements of specialized tissues a variety of perfusion culture containers was constructed (Fig. 3). [...] Each of the perfusion culture containers has at least one inlet and one outlet for the transport of culture medium. A basic version of a container allows the simple bathing of cells respectively growing tissues under continuous medium transport (Fig. 4a). In a gradient container the tissue carrier is placed between the base and the lid so that both sides can be provided with individual media mimicking a typical environment for epithelia (Fig. 4b). A further culture container is made of a transparent lid and base allowing the microscopic observation during tissue development (Fig. 4c).|$|R
30|$|EPT {{structure}} {{which has}} many superior {{features such as}} high power factor, voltage sag/swell compensation, multi-functionality, excellent power quality compared with conventional transformer is proposed in this study. EPT structure {{in this study is}} composed of input, isolation and output stages. Three-phase PWM rectifier at the input stage is not only used in order to convert AC to the constant DC voltage, but also has reactive power compensation ability. PI controllers are generally used in PWM rectifiers due to their simple structures. However, PI controller needs mathematical model of the system to be controlled and has undesirable characteristics such as slow response, large overshoots and oscillation. To cope with these problems, neuro-fuzzy controller that has nonlinear, robust structure and which does not require the mathematical model of the system to be controlled is preferred in this study. Dual active bridge converter at isolation stage is used for DC–DC conversion and is controlled by neuro-fuzzy controller in order to obtain constant DC bus voltage. Three-phase inverter that provides the desired power and voltage to load is located at the output stage. After designing of all stages, a number of simulation studies have been carried out in order to verify performance of EPT structure with the proposed controller under voltage harmonics, voltage flicker and voltage sag/swell conditions. The simulation results illustrate that EPT structure with the neuro-fuzzy controller provides more superior performance than PI controller with respect to rise time, settling time, <b>overshoot,</b> and power <b>factor</b> in all test conditions and is not sensitive these conditions and is capable of regulating output voltages and compensating disturbances in grid voltages. Moreover, proposed EPT provides fast and controllable AC/DC responses because of strong structure of the neuro fuzzy controller and thus, improves the stability of power system.|$|R
40|$|We {{carried out}} a deep subarcsecond BRI imaging of the two middle-aged pulsars to {{establish}} their properties in the optical range. Both pulsars are detected at > 10 sigma level. Geminga is {{for the first time}} reliably detected in the I band with a magnitude of 25. 10 +/- 0. 14. We also reanalyze archival ESO/NTT and HST broadband data and find that some published fluxes for Geminga were estimated inaccurately. The resulting dereddened broadband spectra of both pulsars are remarkably similar to each other and show significant flux increases towards the far-UV and near-IR, and a wide flux excess in V-I bands. This suggests a multicomponent structure of the optical emission. The nonthermal power law component of the pulsar magnetospheric origin dominates in the most part of the optical range. For PSR B 0656 + 14 it is compatible with a low energy extension of the power law tail seen in hard X-rays. For Geminga the respective extension <b>overshoots</b> by a <b>factor</b> of 100 the nonthermal optical flux, which has a less steep spectral slope than in X-rays. This implies a spectral break at a photon energy of about 1 keV. The flux increases towards the far-UV are compatible with contributions of the Rayleigh-Jeans parts of the blackbody components from whole surfaces of the neutron stars dominating in soft X-rays. The V-I excess, which is most significant for PSR B 0656 + 14, suggests a third spectral component of still unidentified origin. Faint, a few arcseconds in size nebulae extended perpendicular to the proper motion directions of the pulsars, are seen around both objects in our deepest I band images. They can be optical counterparts of the bow-shock head of Geminga and of the tentative pulsar wind nebula of PSR B 0656 + 14 observed in X-rays. Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, A&A, accepted.
