5|$|Arkansas {{participated in}} the FLEX 2 at Culebra in January 1936, and then visited New Orleans, during Mardi Gras. She went to Norfolk for a major <b>overhaul</b> that lasted through the spring of 1936. After {{completing}} the <b>overhaul,</b> the ship took another midshipmen crew to European waters; she called in the ports of Portsmouth, England, Gothenburg, Sweden, and Cherbourg, and returned to Annapolis, in August. As in the previous year, she conducted another Reserve training cruise, and then went into drydock for an <b>overhaul</b> in Norfolk. The remainder of the 1930s followed a similar pattern; in 1937, the midshipmen training cruise went to Europe, but the 1938 and 1939 cruises remained in the western Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|On February 6, 1977, Amtrak {{announced}} plans to spend $24.4 million to <b>overhaul</b> all 61 cars {{as part of a}} larger fleet renewal program. In early 1977, some cars were repainted in Amtrak's Phase I paint scheme with red, white and blue ends and a small Amtrak logo. On September 28, the Amtrak board approved a more limited <b>overhaul</b> program of 16 Metroliners, as well as the purchase of the first 8 AEM-7 electric locomotives. On November 7, Amtrak released a specification for overhauling the 57 unmodified cars. It awarded a $20 million <b>overhaul</b> contract to GE that month.|$|E

5|$|After her {{training}} {{exercises in the}} Atlantic and the Pacific were finished, New Mexico was overhauled and modernized at the Philadelphia Harbor by the Navy from March 1931 to January 1933. The <b>overhaul</b> included the replacement of her turbo-electric drive with more conventional geared turbines, which were made by Curtis. In addition, New Mexico received eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns, replacing the four 3-inch/50 caliber guns that had been previously installed.

50|$|ARF was {{established}} in the early 70s in collaboration with The Peoples Republic of China. Initially, the factory started <b>overhauling</b> of F-6 aircraft and with an ever growing sphere of responsibility, the factory undertook the task of <b>overhauling</b> of A - 5III, FT - 5, Y - 12, K - 8 and F - 7 aircraft variants. Since its inception, ARF has evolved into a Centre of Excellence for maintenance, repair and <b>overhauling</b> Chinese aircraft, standing tall amongst MRO organizations in the world. The MRO setup has a number of accreditations to its acclaim, which guarantees quality production. The MRO setup is not only fulfilling the needs of Pakistan Air Force but also undertakes <b>overhauling</b> and repair tasks of friendly countries namely Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Nigeria etc.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the Bayes {{prediction}} of the future failures of a deteriorating repairable mechanical system subject to minimal repairs and periodic <b>overhauls.</b> To model the effect of <b>overhauls</b> on {{the reliability of the}} system a proportional age reduction model is assumed and the 2 -parameter Engelhardt-Bain process (2 -EBP) is used to model the failure process between two successive <b>overhauls.</b> 2 -EBP has an advantage over Power Law Process (PLP) models. It is found that the failure intensity of deteriorating repairable systems attains a finite bound when repeated minimal repair actions are combined with some <b>overhauls.</b> If such a data is analyzed through models with unbounded increasing failure intensity, such as the PLP, then pessimistic estimates of the system reliability will arise and incorrect preventive maintenance policy may be defined. On the basis of the observed data and of a number of suitable prior densities reflecting varied degrees of belief on the failure/repair process and effectiveness of <b>overhauls,</b> the prediction of the future failure times and the number of failures in a future time interval is found. Finally, a numerical application is used to illustrate the advantages from <b>overhauls</b> and sensitivity analysis of the improvement parameter carried out...|$|R

5|$|After the {{invasion}} of the Mariana Islands, she received an <b>overhaul</b> at Bremerton, Washington, from October to November. After the <b>overhaul,</b> she arrived in Leyte Gulf to escort reinforcement and supply transports and convoys. She dealt with daily air attacks, as the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the liberation of the Philippines. She departed Leyte Gulf on 2 December to the Palaus, where she later joined a Mindoro-bound convoy. She provided anti-aircraft fire for the convoy and provided cover fire for invading forces. She provided cover for two more days before retiring to the Palaus.|$|E
5|$|Butlin's, {{the holiday}} camp giant {{purchased}} No. 46229 Duchess of Hamilton following {{the withdrawal of}} this locomotive in February 1964 and it was put {{on display at the}} Minehead holiday camp. In 1975, following a slow deterioration due to the Minehead's salty atmosphere and the looming maintenance costs, Butlin's signed a twenty-year loan agreement for it to be taken under the wing of the National Railway Museum. In 1976, following a cosmetic <b>overhaul,</b> No. 46229 was put on static display in the museum's York premises. In due course a fundraising appeal allowed an <b>overhaul</b> to take place as a precursor to letting the locomotive operate on the national rail network once more.|$|E

5|$|Elected {{officials}} on Staten Island such as Diane Savino have been demanding {{the replacement of}} the Staten Island Railway's aging R44 train cars. Initially, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority planned to order R179s for the Staten Island Railway, but later decided to <b>overhaul</b> some R46s to replace the existing R44s there. However, the plan to <b>overhaul</b> the R46s for the Staten Island Railway was also dropped, and 75 future R211S cars are planned to replace the Staten Island Railway's fleet of R44s instead. Until then, the R44s are undergoing another round of scheduled maintenance to extend their usefulness until at least 2023.|$|E
5|$|Following Rösselsprung, the Germans moved Tirpitz to Bogenfjord near Narvik. By this time, {{the ship}} needed a major <b>overhaul.</b> Hitler had {{forbidden}} {{the ship to}} make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the <b>overhaul</b> was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to Fættenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were erected around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, such that Tirpitz would remain partially operational {{for the majority of}} the <b>overhaul.</b> A caisson was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship's rudders. During the repair process, the British attempted to attack the battleship with two Chariot human torpedoes, but before they could be launched, rough seas caused the human torpedoes to break away from the fishing vessel which was towing them. By 28 December, the <b>overhaul</b> had been completed, and Tirpitz began sea trials. She conducted gunnery trials on 4 January 1943 in Trondheim Fjord. On 21 February, Topp was promoted to Rear Admiral and was replaced by Captain Hans Meyer; five days later the battleship Scharnhorst was ordered to reinforce the fleet in Norway. Vice Admiral Oskar Kummetz was given command of the warships stationed in Norway.|$|E

The <b>overhaul</b> extended her service life by ten years, and {{allowed her to}} carry R-29RMU Sineva missiles. She conducted sea trials in early 2006 and re-entered service shortly thereafter, despite plans {{to do so in}} 2005. Tula post-overhaul operational history is characterised by a number of missile launches, the first of which occurred on 17 December 2007, when she launched a Sineva missile aimed at the Kura Test Range in the Kamchatka Peninsula. Within eight days, Tula launched another missile, again aimed at Kura; both tests were successful.|$|E
