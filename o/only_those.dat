5|$|A {{strain of}} truly domesticated red foxes was {{introduced}} by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting <b>only</b> <b>those</b> individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected <b>only</b> <b>those</b> that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E
5|$|Although the RF-4M {{would have}} had some advantages, it was {{discounted}} as the cost would have been greater, with consequently fewer aircraft purchased, while <b>only</b> <b>those</b> that had been modified {{would have been able}} to undertake the reconnaissance mission.

5|$|Ensuring a plasmid accepts {{an insert}} {{is a common}} problem of DNA cloning. Toxin-antitoxin systems {{can be used to}} {{positively}} select for <b>only</b> <b>those</b> cells that have taken up a plasmid containing the inserted gene of interest, screening out those that lack the inserted gene. An example of this application comes from CcdB-encoded toxin, which has been incorporated into plasmid vectors. The gene of interest is then targeted to recombine into the CcdB locus, inactivating the transcription of the toxic protein. Thus, cells containing the plasmid but not the insert perish due to the toxic effects of CcdB protein, and <b>only</b> <b>those</b> that incorporate the insert survive.|$|E

5|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has good}} spatial resolution (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., <b>only</b> <b>those</b> tubes are probed which have one of the bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E
