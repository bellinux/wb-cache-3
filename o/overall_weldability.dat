40|$|In practice, in {{the design}} stage of revitalization, {{renovation}} or reinforcement, {{there is often a}} need to determine the strength of steel as well as its weldability. The strength of steel can be determined in two ways: directly through destructive testing or indirectly - by the Brinell hardness test. In the case of weldability, this turns out to be much more difficult, because there are three groups of factors which determine this property, i. e. : local weldability, operative weldability, and <b>overall</b> <b>weldability.</b> This paper presents the results of the verification {{of the relationship between the}} hardness and strength of three grades of steel from the early twentieth century. The evaluation of the <b>overall</b> <b>weldability</b> of structural steels is discussed in an analytical approach preceding costly weldability tests. An assessment based on selected indicators of weldability can only lead to confusion...|$|E
40|$|This work aims at {{investigating}} the spot weldability {{of a new}} advanced Quenching and Partitioning (Q&P) steel and a Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel for automotive applications by evaluating {{the effects of the}} main welding parameters on the mechanical performance of their dissimilar spot welds. The welding current, the electrode tip voltage and the electrical resistance of sheet stack were monitored in order to detect any metal expulsion and to evaluate its severity, as well as to clarify its effect on spot strength. The joint strength was assessed by means of shear and cross tension tests. The corresponding fracture modes were determined through optical microscopy. The welding current is the main process parameter that affects the weld strength, followed by the clamping force and welding time. Metal expulsion can occur through a single large expulsion or multiple expulsions, whose effects on the shear and cross tension strength have been assessed. Longer welding times can limit the negative effect of an expulsion if it occurs {{in the first part of}} the joining process. The spot welds exhibit different fracture modes according to their strengths. <b>Overall,</b> a proper <b>weldability</b> window for the selected process parameters has been determined to obtain sound joints...|$|R
