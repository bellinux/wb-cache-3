40|$|Abstract An EM {{algorithm}} for inferring {{the parameters}} of the <b>offset</b> normal <b>shape</b> distribution is derived. Update rules for mixtures of <b>offset</b> normal <b>shape</b> distributions are also provided. For cases where not all landmarks are observed we generalize the EM algorithm to estimate parameters from incomplete data. The algorithm is tested on a number of real-world data sets and on artificially generated data. Contrary to previous claims in the literature, it is shown experimentally that estimation of the full covariance matrix causes no difficulties. In all experiments the estimated distribution provided an excellent approximation to the true <b>offset</b> normal <b>shape</b> distribution...|$|R

In this paper, a new offset-based method is developed to automatically detect the possible sphere-contacting shape of such parts. A polyhedral model that precisely approximates the part shape is given as input, and the <b>offset</b> <b>shape</b> of the model is obtained as the Boolean union of the expanded shapes of all surface triangles. We adopt a triple-dexel representation of the 3 D model to enable stable and precise Boolean union computations. To accelerate the dexel operations in these Boolean computations, a new parallel processing method with a pseudo-list structure and axis-aligned bounding box is developed. The possible sphere-contacting shape of the part surface is then extracted from the <b>offset</b> <b>shape</b> as a set of points or a set of polygons...|$|R

40|$|Short latency (under 10 msec) evoked {{responses}} elicited by {{bursts of}} white noise were recorded from the scalp of human subjects.

The latency {{of the most prominent}} response component, wave V, was markedly delayed with increases in stimulus rise-time but was unaffected by changes in fall-time. The amplitude of wave V was insensitive to changes in signal rise-and-fall times, while increasing signal on-time produced smaller amplitude responses only for sufficiently short off-times.

40|$|The method {{presented}} for antenna upgrading involves a redesign {{of only the}} subreflector portion of a Cassegrain antenna or {{the introduction of a}} subreflector feed system for a paraboloid. A pair of offset subreflectors are synthesized which will produce a controllable high gain amplitude distribution in the aperture of the large paraboloid. The synthesis method is based on the approximate formulation for an <b>offset</b> dual <b>shaped</b> high gain antenna first presented by Galindo-Israel and Mittra (1977). It is pointed out that in their approximate formulation, the geometrical optics energy was scattered from a subreflector and then from a second large reflector, which reflected a uniform phase distribution. In the <b>offset</b> dual <b>shaped</b> subreflector (DSS) antenna proposed here, the second reflection is from a smaller (sub) reflector, and it scatters a spherical wave that feeds a hyperboloid or feeds a large paraboloid directly.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} to approximate the variable radius offset curves by cubic B'ezier curves. The offset curve is approximated by a cubic B'ezier curve which interpolates the positions and derivatives {{of the exact}} offset curve at both end points. Thus, it approximates the exact offset curve very closely near the curve end points, but not necessarily {{in the middle of}} the curve. Given a fixed base curve, by changing the offset radius and its derivative at an end point, one can easily control the <b>offset</b> curve <b>shape</b> near the end point. To better control the <b>offset</b> curve <b>shape</b> {{in the middle of the}} curve, we use two global shape parameters (bias and tension) of the offset curve (see [16]). A variety of variable radius offset curves are easily generated by using six shape control parameters (the two offsets and their derivatives at both end points, and the bias and tension parameters). Each bristle of a B'ezier brush stroke is represented by a variable radius offset curve. Even with simpl [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} {{synthesis}} of <b>offset</b> <b>shaped</b> single reflector antenna is considered. This problem has to be solved when a reflector antenna system is required to control the field amplitude and/or phase on the far-field or on the output aperture in the near-field. Achieving high efficiency {{is a very important}} objective of the design and shaped reflector antennas are used for that purpose. The equations of the problem are strongly nonlinear partial differential equations which can not be analyzed by standard techniques. Though the problem {{has been the subject of}} study by many authors for over 40 years, up until recently, there were no rigorous theoretical results resolving completely the questions of existence and uniqueness. With few exceptions, authors have attacked the problem with heuristic numerical procedures, and, depending on the specific formulation, obtained different results not always in agreement with each other. In this paper a new method for solving the single reflector problem is presented. The new method allows a complete and mathematically rigorous investigation of this problem. Furthermore, the proposed method lends itself to a numerical implementation and we present here several examples.

40|$|In this paper, we derive joint {{parameter}} estimation bounds for the symbol timing offset, carrier phase, and carrier frequency <b>offset</b> for any <b>shaped</b> <b>offset</b> quadrature {{phase shift keying}} (SOQPSK) waveform. Specifically, we calculate the conditional CramÃ©r-Rao bound (CCRB) for a known given data sequence and compare this to the modified CramÃ©r-Rao bound (MCRB) for the case in which the data pattern is unknown and random. This allows us to assess the performance of candidate preamble waveforms for parameter acquisition. We show how to simplify the CCRB when the preamble waveform is periodic and compare the CCRB performance of several candidate preambles to the MCRB. For the Telemetry Group (TG) variant of SOQPSK (i. e., SOQPSK-TG), we specifically show that certain candidate preambles can offer substantial improvements over the MCRB in terms of symbol timing offset estimation with negligible adverse impact on the estimation of the carrier phase and carrier frequency offset...|$|R

Parameters freq and duration set the frequency (Hz) and duration (sec) of the sine burst, respectively. The parameter cycles_to_draw sets the initial zoom limit in the analysis figure, so that dynamic distortion effects are easy to see. For example, a value of 10 would result in a waveform analysis figure, where 10 cycles of the response wave were displayed. The optimal value for the cycles_to_draw parameter obviously depends on the dynamic distortion characteristics of the device.

The proposed method consists of an EM algorithm whose update steps resemble those of the widely used general procrustes algorithm. Our method is shown to be easily applicable in many practical examples.

It rests on the insight that there is a bidirec-tional dependency between the frequency of an oscilla-tion, and geometric properties of the neural oscillatorâ€™s phase portrait.
