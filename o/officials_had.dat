5|$|This is not {{say there}} was no popular concern; by 2005 for example a chorus of US {{executives}} along with trade union and mid-ranking government <b>officials</b> <b>had</b> been speaking out about what they perceived to be unfair trade practices by China.|$|E
5|$|By 2008, most {{residents}} of South Ossetia had obtained Russian passports. According to Reuters, Russia supplied two-thirds of South Ossetia's annual budget before the war. Russian <b>officials</b> <b>had</b> {{de facto control}} of South Ossetia's security institutions, including the armed forces; South Ossetia's de facto government was largely staffed with Russians and South Ossetians with Russian passports, who had occupied equivalent government positions in Russia.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, American law {{enforcement}} <b>officials</b> <b>had</b> reports of Noriega's possible involvement with narcotics trafficking. No formal criminal investigations were begun, however, with news reports attributing {{the lack of}} action to factors including U.S. interest in concluding the Panama Canal treaty, the value of intelligence from Panama, and Panama's support for U.S. foreign policy.|$|E

5|$|On January 27, 2010, an {{official}} from the U.S. State Department said that Abdulmutallab's visa was not revoked because federal authorities {{believed that it}} would have compromised a larger investigation. The official, Patrick F. Kennedy, said intelligence <b>officials</b> <b>had</b> told the State Department that letting Abdulmutallab keep his visa would allow for a greater chance of exposing the terrorist network.|$|E
50|$|Many controversies {{have arisen}} over its {{treatment}} of Catholic politicians who support abortion rights.

5|$|The {{night of}} 30 to 31 January was quieter in Cairo, with fewer reports of looting. For {{the fourth day}} in a row the curfew was {{violated}} without repercussions. Security <b>officials</b> <b>had</b> announced that the curfew would start at 3:00pm and threatened to shoot anyone who ignored it, although eventually little or no action was taken as security and army personnel left Tahrir Square.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{preparation}} for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built on an alluvial fan that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars. Residents stayed inside their dwellings to avoid the falling ash, as local <b>officials</b> <b>had</b> instructed them to do, not thinking {{that they might be}} buried by the mudflows.|$|E
5|$|After a whistle-blower {{reported}} that the MSDF's preference had been improperly changed an investigation was launched. On December 16 2016 the Japanese Ministry of Defense (the Defense Agency having been upgraded to a ministry in 2007) stated {{that it had not}} confirmed lobbying efforts but the ministry admonished Tomohisa Takei, the JMSDF chief of staff, for mentioning the MCH-101 by name during the procurement process to his subordinates. This had come after MSDF <b>officials</b> <b>had</b> {{reported that}} the Mitsubishi-built SH helicopters may be best.|$|E

5|$|As {{the date}} of the {{disaster}} nears, Dilip arranges a loan for the wedding of his sister. Roy later explains how the company is ignoring safety standards, and that how a future leak might become uncontrolled as the <b>officials</b> <b>had</b> turned off safety measures to reduce the maintenance costs. Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip not to talk about the plant's safety if he wishes to retain his job. Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy just said, and expresses his fear about the plant's safety, saying he will return to the rickshaw-pulling business as soon as his sister is married.|$|E
5|$|Cloverleaf {{announced}} Rosecroft {{would close}} on July 1, 2010. Live racing ended in 2009, {{and the track}} only had simulcasts as revenue from off-track betting. After several of the surrounding states legalized casinos, Rosecroft was unable to continue as a successful business. Cloverleaf Enterprises filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2009. Mark Vogel loaned the track $350,000 and offered to buy the track, but a bankruptcy court judge refused to approve the plan. Rosecroft <b>officials</b> <b>had</b> hoped that the Maryland General Assembly would approve legislation allowing casino-style gambling at Rosecroft, {{but that did not}} occur. In early June 2010, Cloverleaf filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{economic}} indicators, the Budget presented in August 1974 saw large increases in spending, especially in education. Treasury <b>officials</b> <b>had</b> advised {{a series of}} tax and fee increases, ranging from excise taxes {{to the cost of}} posting a letter; their advice was mostly rejected by Cabinet. The Budget was unsuccessful in dealing with the inflation and unemployment, and Whitlam introduced large tax cuts in November. He also announced additional spending to help the private sector.|$|E

5|$|From March 2013, {{concerns}} over further currency war diminished, though in November several journalists and analysts warned {{of a possible}} fresh outbreak. The likely principal source of tension appeared to shift once again, this time not being the U.S. versus China or the Eurozone versus Japan, but the U.S. versus Germany. In late October U.S. treasury <b>officials</b> <b>had</b> criticized Germany for running an excessively large current account surplus, thus acting as a drag on the global economy.|$|E
5|$|His murder {{became a}} {{national}} cause célèbre. Several independent inquiries concluded that local government <b>officials</b> <b>had</b> been involved. However, the Bantul police early on discounted a political motive. Instead, they arrested a local driver named Dwi Sumaji for the murder, alleging a motive of jealousy. Sumaji was later acquitted after the prosecution withdrew its case owing {{to a lack of}} evidence. The police in turn were successfully sued for their mishandling of the case and deliberate destruction of evidence. The murder has never been solved, and is expected to be unprosecutable after 2014 due to Indonesia's 18-year statute of limitations on murder.|$|E
5|$|In May 1946, SMERSH agents {{recovered}} from the crater where Hitler was buried two burned skull fragments with gunshot damage. These remains were apparently forgotten in the Russian State Archives until 1993, when they were re-found. In 2009 DNA and forensic tests were performed on the skull fragment, which Soviet <b>officials</b> <b>had</b> long believed to be Hitler's. According to the American researchers, the tests revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman and {{the examination of the}} sutures where the skull plates come together placed her age at less than 40 years old. The jaw fragments which had been recovered in May 1945 were not tested.|$|E
