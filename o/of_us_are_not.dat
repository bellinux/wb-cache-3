2500|$|In Echlin's {{article in}} The Guardian, six reasons for {{choosing}} polyamory are identified: a drive towards female independence and equality driven by feminism; disillusionment with monogamy; a yearning for community; honesty and realism {{in respect of}} relational nature of human beings; human nature; and individual non-matching of the traditional monogamous stereotype. Jim Fleckenstein, director of the Institute for 21st-Century Relationships, is quoted as stating that the polyamory movement has been driven not only by science fiction, but also by feminism: [...] "Increased financial independence means that women can build relationships {{the way they want}} to." [...] The disillusionment with monogamy is said to be [...] "because of widespread cheating and divorce". The longing for community is associated with a felt need for the richness of [...] "complex and deep relationships through extended networks" [...] in response to the replacement and fragmentation of the extended family by nuclear families. [...] "For many", Echlin writes, [...] "it is a hankering for community... we have become increasingly alienated, partly because of the 20th century's replacement of the extended family with the nuclear family. As a result, many of us are striving to create complex and deep relationships through extended networks of multiple lovers and extended families... Polys agree that some people are monogamous by nature. But some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> and more and more are refusing to be shoehorned into monogamy." ...|$|E

60|$|Everybody {{found the}} {{relationship}} charming. Some {{of the more}} conscientious people, it is true, pretended {{to think that the}} Reverend Harold Benham was a first husband and long since dead, but that was all. As a matter of fact, in his increasingly futile way he wasn't, either at Seagate or in the Educational Supplement of the TIMES. But even the most conscientious <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> obliged to go to Seagate or read the Educational Supplement of the TIMES.|$|E
5000|$|Which <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{lives on}} {{twenty-four hours a}} day? And when I say [...] "lives," [...] I do not mean exists, nor [...] "muddles through."

Which <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> saying to himself -- which <b>of</b> <b>us</b> has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> saying to himself all his life: [...] "I shall alter that when I {{have a little more}} time"?

2500|$|As this {{response}} makes clear, Marquis's argument requires that what will later have valuable experiences and activities {{is the same}} entity, the same biological organism, as the embryo.

60|$|Not {{to dispute}} with you--far from it! I own with sorrow that your {{severity}} does occasionally encounter us on assailable ground. But there are exceptions, {{even to the}} stiffest rules. Some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> guilty of wilful carelessness: some of us apply to competent authority, when we write on subjects beyond the range of our own experience. Having thus far ventured to speak for my colleagues, you will conclude that I am {{paving the way for}} speaking next of myself. As our cousins in the United States say--that is so.|$|E

I daresay it would be simpler to have no bodies, but we're all in the same box, {{and it would be a}} great injustice to the idea, and we're all showing ourselves all the while; only some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> worth paying." ...|$|E

"Now look here, Uncle," [...] and Pierre knelt by his side, {{looking up}} into the {{wrinkled}} black face with a cheery smile {{as if there was}} nothing in all this wide world to trouble him.

I will walk across to the {{hospital}} and ask how the sergeant is going on. I am strangely placed towards him now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly," [...] he answered, benignly. [...] "You {{have managed}} to please everybody, Mr. Parr included,--and some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> easy to please. I thought I'd tell you this, as a friend, as your first friend in the parish. Your {{achievement}} has been all the more remarkable, following, as you did, Dr. Gilman. Now it would greatly distress me to see that state of things disturbed, both for your sake and others. I thought I would just give you a hint, as {{you are going to}} see Mr. Parr, that he is in rather a nervous state. These so-called political reformers have upset the market and started a lot of legal complications that's why I'm here to-night. Go easy with him. I know you won't do anything foolish." ...|$|E
60|$|My friends, {{whether you}} will be the happier for it, or for any {{knowledge}} of physical science, or for any other knowledge whatsoever, I cannot tell: that lies in the decision of a Higher Power than I; and, indeed, to speak honestly, I do not think that bio-geology or any other branch of physical science is likely, at first at least, to make you happy. Neither is the study of your fellow-men. Neither is religion itself. We were not sent into the world to be happy, but to be right; at least, poor creatures that we are, as right as we can be; and we must be content with being right, and not happy. For I fear, or rather I hope, that most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> capable of carrying out Talleyrand's recipe for perfect happiness on earth--namely, a hard heart and a good digestion. Therefore, as our hearts are, happily, not always hard, and our digestions, unhappily, not always good, we will be content to be made wise by physical science, even though we be not made happy.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not know}} whether I shall be able to impart the feeling of an obscure pathos in the case of Mrs. Alderling, which I {{certainly}} did not experience in Alderling's. Temperamentally he was less fitted to undergo the rigors of their seclusion than she was; in his liking to talk, he needed an audience and a variety of listening, and she, in her somewhat feline calm, could not have been troubled by any such need. You can be silent to yourself, but you cannot very well be loquacious, without danger of having the devil for a listener, if the old saying is true. Yet still, I felt a keener poignancy in her sequestration. Her beauty had even greater claim to regard than his eloquence. She was a woman who could have commanded a whole roomful with it, and no one would have wanted a word from her. She could only have been entirely herself in society, where, and in spite of everything that can be said against it, we can each, if we will, be more natural than out of it. The reason that most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> natural in it is that we want to play parts for which we are more or less unfit, and Marion Alderling never wished to play a part, I was sure. It would have sufficed her to be herself wherever she was, and the more people there were by, the more easily she could have been herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Even at {{this day}} I am {{surprised}} {{that all three}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> captured by that army of boys, each of whom was armed {{with one of those}} disagreeable sling-shots, pea-shooters, or whatever you choose to call them. I was panting from long running, and my wife so excited as hardly to know whether she was on her feet or her ears, while poor little Sonny Bunny was so confused by seeing us in such a state that he actually quivered.|$|R

What is it makes you love--ah! sir, that is very hidden and mysterious. She had never lost the trick of closing her lips tightly when she remembered her uneven tooth. You may say that was vanity, but in a young girl--and which <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> vain, eh? 'Old men and maidens, young men and children!' ...|$|R

6000|$|She {{explored}} the place discreetly and on tiptoe, talking twaddle {{as she went}} and bending her head and her eyeglass over various objects {{with an air of}} imperfect comprehension that didn't prevent Nick's private recall of the story of her underhand, commercial habits told by Gabriel Nash at the exhibition in Paris the first time her name had fallen on his ear. A queer old woman from whom, if you approached her in the right way, you could buy old pots--it was in this character that she had originally been introduced to him. He had lost sight of it afterwards, but it revived again as his observant eyes, {{at the same time that}} they followed his active hand, became aware of her instinctive, appraising gestures. There was a moment when he frankly laughed out--there was so little in his poor studio to appraise. Mrs. Rooth's wandering eyeglass and vague, polite, disappointed, bent back and head made a subject for a sketch on the instant: they gave such a sudden pictorial glimpse of the element of race. He found himself seeing the immemorial Jewess in her hold up a candle in a crammed back shop. There was no candle indeed and his studio was not crammed, and it had never occurred to him before that she was a grand-daughter of Israel save on the general theory, so stoutly held by several clever people, that few <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> under suspicion. The late Rudolf Roth had at least been, and his daughter was visibly her father's child; so that, flanked by such a pair, good Semitic presumptions sufficiently crowned the mother. Receiving Miriam's sharp, satiric shower without shaking her shoulders she might at any rate have been the descendant of a tribe long persecuted. Her blandness was beyond all baiting; she professed she could be as still as a mouse. Miriam, on the other side of the room, in the tranquil beauty of her attitude--"found" [...] indeed, as Nick had said--watched her a little and then declared she had best have been locked up at home. Putting aside her free account of the dangers to which her mother exposed her, it wasn't whimsical to imagine that within the limits of that repose from which the Neville-Nugents never wholly departed the elder lady might indeed be a trifle fidgety and have something on her mind. Nick presently mentioned that it wouldn't be possible for him to [...] "send home" [...] his second performance; and he added, in the exuberance of having already got a little into relation with his work, that perhaps this didn't matter, inasmuch as--if Miriam would give him his time, to say nothing of her own--a third and a fourth masterpiece might also some day very well struggle into the light. His model rose to this without conditions, assuring him he might count upon her till she grew too old and too ugly and that nothing would make her so happy as that he should paint her as often as Romney had painted the celebrated Lady Hamilton. [...] "Ah Lady Hamilton!" [...] deprecated Mrs. Rooth; while Miriam, who had on occasion the candour of a fine acquisitiveness, wished to know what particular reason there might be for his not letting them have the picture he was now beginning.|$|E

60|$|At any rate, I {{heard one}} of them, {{pointing}} to Hans, ask Komba whether the ape-man was our god or only our captain. The compliment seemed to please Hans, who hitherto had never been looked on either as a god or a captain.

5000|$|Although Tarek's work is seen {{to others}} {{as a part of}} a {{political}} agenda, she states that, [...] "most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> really political; us artists … are not about politics, nor is our art. We’re about style and technique. It’s not about heavy political subject matter" [...] She states that after the revolution, the West's view of Egypt changed drastically, which is why lots of artists portrayed political ideals in their work. However, she is more concerned in making good art that can be valued for more than just a political statement.|$|E
50|$|A large {{proportion}} of our life is spent in achieving our career goals, thus {{it is very important}} to make sure that right steps were taken and correct planning was done in the early years of your life.

But majority <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> sure what we want from life and so it in very important to plan out things.
