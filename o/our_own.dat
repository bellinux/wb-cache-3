5|$|He {{was also}} part of the {{documentary}} film Genre de Vie, about bicycles, cities and personal awareness. It looks at desired space and <b>our</b> <b>own</b> impact to the process of it. The film documents urban life empowered by the simplicity of the bicycle.|$|E
5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started <b>our</b> <b>own</b> print shop in order to print <b>our</b> <b>own</b> newspapers and magazines.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, when Hooker Telescope was completed, the {{prevailing}} view still {{was that the}} Universe consisted entirely of the Milky Way Galaxy. Using the Hooker Telescope, Edwin Hubble identified Cepheid variables in several spiral nebulae and in 1922–1923 proved conclusively that Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum among others, were entire galaxies outside <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> thus proving that Universe consists of multitude of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Our</b> <b>own</b> galaxy, the Milky Way, {{is a large}} {{disk-shaped}} barred-spiral galaxy about 30kiloparsecs {{in diameter}} and a kiloparsec thick. It contains about two hundred billion (2×1011) stars and has a total mass of about six hundred billion (6×1011) times {{the mass of the}} Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} {{distance of}} the Andromeda Galaxy from <b>our</b> <b>own</b> was doubled in 1953 when {{it was discovered that}} there is another, dimmer type of Cepheid. In the 1990s, measurements of both standard red giants as well as red clump stars from the Hipparcos satellite measurements were used to calibrate the Cepheid distances.|$|E

5|$|The {{physiological}} {{similarities between}} humans and other animals, especially primates, have led to more comparative research between the two groups.

5|$|GJ 3021 is a solar twin—a star {{very like}} <b>our</b> <b>own</b> Sun—around 57 light-years distant with a {{spectral}} type G8V {{and magnitude of}} 6.7. It has a Jovian planet companion (GJ 3021 b). Orbiting about 0.5AU from its sun, it has a minimum mass 3.37 times that of Jupiter and a period of around 133 days. The system is a complex one as the faint star GJ 3021B orbits {{at a distance of}} 68 AU; it is a red dwarf of spectral type M4V.|$|E
5|$|Hemming's {{introduction}} {{to his work}} (Prefatio) claims that it was produced to teach Wulfstan's successors: about the things which have been committed to their care, and to show them which lands justly belong (or ought to belong) to the church, and which have been unjustly seized by evil men—first, during the Danish invasions; later, by unjust royal officials and tax collectors; and most recently, by the violence of Normans in <b>our</b> <b>own</b> time, who by force, guile and rapine have unjustly deprived this holy church of its lands, villages and possessions, until hardly anything is safe from their depredations.|$|E

5000|$|We’ve succeeded {{all along}} because we flipped the nonprofit model {{for social change}} on its head, setting up a for-profit company that doesn’t rely on {{fundraising}} and that isn’t driven by the whims of benefactors. This frees us to take courageous positions in our political advocacy. We’re also privately <b>owned</b> (<b>our</b> employees <b>own</b> most of <b>our</b> stock), not publicly traded, which liberates us from short-term financial considerations and hostile Wall Street takeovers. In other words, we’re independent to the core.|$|R
5|$|I'm {{giving you}} an example of how I think every woman should feel about herself. No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in <b>our</b> <b>own</b> unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E
5|$|Second, Asch {{emphasized}} that independent thought and disagreement among group members is {{a cornerstone of}} group functioning. He believed that only by settling our differences with other group members can we actually understand the shortcomings of <b>our</b> <b>own</b> beliefs (Levine, 1999). This notion has been embraced by social scientists like Moscovici, who has pursued this rationale {{as the basis for}} his theory of minority influence in group situations, and has also been incorporated into sociocognitive conflict theory.|$|E
5|$|The ancient oracles of the prophets, {{delivered}} {{to us in}} the Scripture, declare this; the lives of pious men, who shone in old time with every virtue, bear witness to posterity of the same; and <b>our</b> <b>own</b> days prove it to be true, wherein Constantine, who alone of all that ever wielded the Roman power was the friend of God the Sovereign of all, has appeared to all mankind so clear an example of a godly life.|$|E

5|$|The {{equivalence}} between gravitational and {{inertial effects}} {{does not constitute}} a complete theory of gravity. When it comes to explaining gravity near <b>our</b> <b>own</b> location on the Earth's surface, noting that our reference frame is not in free fall, so that fictitious forces are to be expected, provides a suitable explanation. But a freely falling reference frame {{on one side of}} the Earth cannot explain why the people on the opposite side of the Earth experience a gravitational pull in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains <b>our</b> <b>own.</b> The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E
5|$|We {{believe the}} enemy has {{undoubtedly}} suffered a crushing defeat. We thank Admiral Kinkaid for his intervention yesterday. We thank Lee for his sturdy effort last night. <b>Our</b> <b>own</b> aircraft has been grand in its relentless hammering of the foe. All those efforts are appreciated but our greatest homage goes to Callaghan, Scott and their men who with magnificent courage against seemingly hopeless odds drove back the first hostile attack and {{paved the way}} for the success to follow. To them the men of Cactus lift their battered helmets in deepest admiration.|$|E

60|$|We {{left the}} fly, and wandered down towards the old gabled court, {{nestling}} amid huge walnuts in its southward glen; while before us spread a panorama, half sea, half land, than which, perhaps, <b>our</b> England <b>owns</b> few lovelier.|$|R

5|$|We should, however, be recreant to our duty, be {{unworthy of}} our gallant forefathers, and commit base treason against our posterity, should we permit Cuba to be Africanized {{and become a}} second St. Domingo (Haiti), with all its {{attendant}} horrors to the white race, and suffer the flames to extend to <b>our</b> <b>own</b> neighboring shores, seriously to endanger or actually to consume the fair fabric of our Union.|$|E
5|$|Woodward’s own {{judgment}} {{of the war and}} of Bush doesn’t really matter. In the course of four books he has given readers the conversations and documents we need to reach <b>our</b> <b>own</b> judgments. He has also, however unevenly and imperfectly, supplied enough synthesis and analysis to make that judgment genuinely informed. Sure, these books can be a slog. But they stand as the fullest story yet of the Bush presidency and of the war that is likely to be its most important legacy.|$|E
