The AW configuration was investigated with two tails, <b>one</b> <b>sized</b> for the AW configuration and a larger <b>one</b> <b>sized</b> for the EBF configuration. The emphasis {{of the study was}} on the 70 -knot approach task. The stability and control characteristics were compared with existing criteria.

Examination revealed larger <b>one</b> <b>sized</b> of 16 cm× 15 cm and smaller one about 8 cm× 5 cm. Lesions were Keratotic, verrucous, nontender, cauliflower-like indurated plaque.

The conclusive diagnosis was tuberculosis verrucosa cutis based on above findings.

40|$|Abstract. A novel image {{encryption}} scheme comprising of one permutation {{process and}} one diffusion process is proposed. In the permutation process, the image sized is expanded to <b>one</b> <b>sized</b> {{by dividing the}} plain-image into two parts: one consisting of the higher 4 bits and one consisting of the lower 4 bits. The permutation operations are done row-by-row and column-by-column to increase the speed. The chaotic generalized Arnold map is utilized to generate chaotic sequence, which is quantized to shuffle the expanded image. The chaotic sequence for permutation process is dependent on plain-image and cipher keys, resulting in good key sensitivity and plain-image sensitivity. To achieve more avalanche effect and larger key space, Chinese Remainder Theorem is applied to diffuse the shuffled image. The key sensitivity and key space of the proposed image encryption have been analyzed as well. The experimental {{results suggest that the}} proposed image encryption scheme can be used for secure image and video communication applications...|$|E

The turbulente eddies {{are designed to be}} of such size and/or intensity that the different sized particle(s) are entrained into the eddies to significantly different extents and forced to follow different trajectories (3, 4), increasing the likelihood of collisions and interactions. Optimum collision rates will occur for a system which maintains a Stokes Number (St) much less than 1 for <b>one</b> <b>sized</b> particle, and or order 1 or greater for the other sized particle.

40|$|To {{provide a}} {{cost-effective}} means for satellite operators {{to comply with}} 25 -year post-mission orbital lifetime restriction, Tethers Unlimited is developing a lightweight de-orbit module called the “Terminator Tape™”. The Terminator Tape is a small module that bolts onto any side of a spacecraft during satellite integration. At {{the completion of the}} satellite’s mission, the satellite will activate the Terminator Tape module, which will then deploy a fifty-meter length of thin conducting tape. This tape will not only significantly enhance the aerodynamic drag experienced by the system, but will also generate electrodynamic drag forces through passive interactions with the Earth’s magnetic field and conducting ionospheric plasma, de-orbiting the satellite within 25 years. Two modules are currently in development, <b>one</b> <b>sized</b> for microsatellites operating at altitudes of less than 900 km, and the other sized for CubeSats operating at altitudes of up to 1100 km.

40|$|Purpose. Closed hollow bulb {{obturators}} {{are used}} for the rehabilitation of postmaxillectomy patients. However, the time consuming process, complexity of fabrication, water leakage, and discoloration are notable disadvantages of this technique. This paper describes a clinical report of fabricating closed hollow bulb obturator using a single flask and one time processing method for an acquired maxillary defect. Hard thermoplastic resin sheet {{has been used for}} the fabrication of hollow bulb part of the obturator. Method. After fabrication of master cast conventionally, bulb and lid part of the defect were formed separately and joined by autopolymerizing acrylic resin to form <b>one</b> <b>sized</b> smaller hollow body. During packing procedure, the defect area was loaded with heat polymerizing acrylic resin and then previously fabricated smaller hollow body was adapted over it. The whole area was then loaded with heat cure acrylic. Further processes were carried out conventionally. Conclusion. This technique uses single flask which reduces laboratory time and makes the procedure simple. The thickness of hollow bulb can be controlled and light weight closed hollow bulb prosthesis can be fabricated. It also minimizes the disadvantages of closed hollow bulb obturator such as water leakage, bacterial infection, and discoloration...|$|E
40|$|A {{great many}} chaos-based image {{encryption}} schemes {{have been proposed}} in the past decades. Most of them use the permutation-diffusion architecture in pixel level, which has been proved insecure enough as they are not dependent on plain-images and so cannot resist chosen/known plain-image attack usually. In this paper, we propose a novel image encryption scheme comprising of one permutation process and one diffusion process. In the permutation process, the image sized is expanded to <b>one</b> <b>sized</b> by dividing the plain-image into two parts: one consisting of the higher 4 bits and one consisting of the lower 4 bits. The permutation operations are done row-by-row and column-by-column {{to increase the speed}} of permutation process. The chaotic cat map is utilized to generate chaotic sequences, which are quantized to shuffle the expanded image. The chaotic sequence for permutation process is dependent on plain-image and cipher keys, resulting in good key sensitivity and plain-image sensitivity. To achieve more avalanche effect and larger key space, a chaotic Bernoulli shift map based bilateral (i. e., horizontal and vertical) diffusion function is applied as well. The security and performance of the proposed image encryption have been analyzed, including histograms, correlation coefficients, information entropy, key sensitivity analysis, key space analysis, differential analysis, encryption rate analysis etc. All the experimental results suggest that the proposed image encryption scheme is robust and secure and can be used for secure image and video communication applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine the changes in electromyographic activities in the shoulder and forearm muscles when using the bare hands, well-fitting gloves, and gloves that are <b>one</b> <b>size</b> smaller or <b>one</b> <b>size</b> larger for simulated assembly operations. Sixteen asymptomatic seated workers with normal hands and no obvious deformities, skin diseases, or allergies were recruited. The {{subjects were asked to}} simulate assembly operations using their bare hands, well-fitting gloves, and <b>one</b> <b>size</b> smaller or <b>one</b> <b>size</b> larger. This study showed that wearing the wrong glove size led to a decrease in forceful activation of the forearm muscle and a compensatory increase in shoulder movement. In contrast, use of the bare hands or wearing well-fitting gloves led to effective forearm muscle activation, which decreased inefficient shoulder movement. These data indicate that wearing the wrong glove size will lead to continuous inefficient use of the forearm and shoulder muscles, and result in overuse of the shoulder...|$|R
