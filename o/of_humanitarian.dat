The Office for the Coordination <b>of</b> <b>Humanitarian</b> Affairs in Panama alerted officials in Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala about the possible impacts from Beta. Civil defence officials in El Salvador declared a pre-emptive alert due to the possibility of rain-triggered mudslides from the outer bands of Beta.|$|E
40|$|The rules <b>of</b> {{international}} <b>humanitarian</b> law <b>of</b> {{armed conflict}} are codified {{in a rather}} extensive body of treaty law. In addition, extensive {{research has been conducted}} into the rules <b>of</b> customary international <b>humanitarian</b> law. The author of this contribution will argue that there is another important source <b>of</b> positive international <b>humanitarian</b> law: principles <b>of</b> international <b>humanitarian</b> law. In this chapter, the role of the principles <b>of</b> international <b>humanitarian</b> law, the functions they perform and their legal significance as a source <b>of</b> international <b>humanitarian</b> law will be assessed. With general public international law as its starting point, the chapter discusses the sources <b>of</b> international <b>humanitarian</b> law. It explains the important role of the Martens Clause and provides examples of how the principles <b>of</b> international <b>humanitarian</b> law may be applied in contemporary armed conflicts...|$|R

5|$|In 2003, the division's headquarters, {{along with}} the 1st Brigade, {{returned}} to Afghanistan. During that time, they operated in the frontier {{regions of the country}} such as Paktika Province, going places previously untouched by the war in search of Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. Fighting in several small-scale conflicts such as Operation Avalanche, Operation Mountain Resolve, and Operation Mountain Viper, the division maintained a strategy of small units moving through remote regions of the country to interact directly with the population and drive out insurgents. The 1st Brigade also undertook a number <b>of</b> <b>humanitarian</b> missions.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Bonita in January 1996 struck both Madagascar and Mozambique, causing severe damage. The {{long-lived}} storm began {{developing in}} the last hours of 1995, and slowly consolidated over the open waters of the South-West Indian Ocean. Tracking generally toward the west-southwest, the disturbance received its name from Météo-France on January 5. Ultimately peaking as an intense tropical cyclone, Bonita bypassed Mauritius and Réunion to the north before striking northeastern Madagascar late on January 10. There, the storm affected up to 150,000 people, flooded wide tracts of croplands, and killed 25 people. In the aftermath, disaster relief came from both the government of Madagascar and the international community, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs); the United Nations Department <b>of</b> <b>Humanitarian</b> Affairs assisted {{in the distribution of}} about $450,000 in monetary donations.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the scale}} of the cyclone damage, the {{government}} issued an international appeal for assistance. As a result, the United Nations Department <b>of</b> <b>Humanitarian</b> Affairs provided a grant of $30,000. UNICEF provided about $48,000 to secure drug kits for children impacted by the cyclone. The Red Cross of Seychelles donated about one tonne of clothing and 20tonnes of tuna, and the Red Cross of Réunion sent drugs to Madagascar. The government of France also sent a crew from Réunion to Madagascar to assist in the aftermath, as well as a plane to airdrop the aid. The governments of Germany, Japan, France, the United Kingdom each donated about $100,000 to Madagascar, while the United States provided about $25,000 and 500tons of food. The government of Japan also sent 2,040blankets and 10tents. By February18, the total contributions by the international community reached about $3million.|$|E

Prior to retirement, the last major missions were flown during the 2010–11 Queensland floods, in which Sea Kings provided SAR coverage of the region and delivered aid relief to citizens in the flooded areas.|$|E

5|$|On December18, 1998, the United Nations {{launched}} a large-scale rehabilitation effort in Cuba. Roughly $14million {{was spent on}} housing and infrastructure reconstruction and repair; {{this portion of the}} project consisted of reconstruction of homes, schools, businesses, hospitals, irrigation and the water system. Another $1.1million was used to inform and protect residents against post-storm diseases. The largest part of the effort involved jump-starting agriculture and fisheries. Roughly $50.4million was provided to reconstruct fishing vessels, purchase new tools and gear. By mid-February 1999, the Governments of Italy, Germany, Canada and the European Union provided $1million, $714,000, $50,000, and $510,200 in funds respectively. The Government of Israel also supplied agricultural tools. The Government of Norway provided $29,100 in water-borne disease prevention funds.

5|$|People {{displaced}} by the 2010 earthquake are at {{an increased risk of}} sex trafficking and forced labor. The international protections in place for the internally displaced, primarily the 1998 United Nations Office for the Coordination <b>of</b> <b>Humanitarian</b> Affairs Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, do not apply to earthquake survivors who have crossed an international border. There is nothing protecting the externally displaced, which creates significant protection gaps for those most vulnerable to trafficking—girls and young women—who are treated as migration offenders rather than forced migrants in need of protection. No temporary protected status has been created or granted in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Linda caused {{considerable}} {{deaths in}} Vietnam. Many fishermen and sailors were caught at sea {{in the path}} of the storm, unable to escape its path. Within three days, the death toll in Vietnam was set at over 150, with thousands missing, many of them fishermen. By the fourth day after the storm, the toll reached 390, and on November 14, eight days after the storm, the death toll reached 464. Ultimately, the death toll was set at 3,111. Eight days after Linda's passage, a United Nations Department <b>of</b> <b>Humanitarian</b> Affairs (DHA) report indicated 857people were injured by the storm. The government quickly established search and rescue teams, particularly for missing fishermen, and a total of 3,513 people were rescued after the storm. In the weeks after the storm, hundreds of dead bodies washed ashore in Vietnam and Thailand.|$|E
