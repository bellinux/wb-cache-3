5|$|At Hanford, top {{priority}} was initially {{given to the}} installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> <b>and</b> materials.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, unbearably {{inadequate}} {{housing and}} overcrowded neighborhoods pushed working {{men out of}} the home and into saloons where they congregated for drink and discussion. Wealthy capitalists wishing {{to strike a balance between}} the demands <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> <b>and</b> desires of capital looked to Robert Owen's example. George Pullman and William Halliday implemented a policy of tolerance in their towns identical to that of Robert Owen. The peaceful atmosphere in Pullman and Hallidayboro can be attributed in part to the absence of alcohol.|$|E

5|$|Manhattan {{has been}} the scene of many {{important}} American cultural movements. In 1912, about 20,000 workers, a quarter of them women, marched upon Washington Square Park to commemorate the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which killed 146 workers on March 25, 1911. Many of the women wore fitted tucked-front blouses like those manufactured by the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, a clothing style that became the working woman's uniform and a symbol of women's liberation, reflecting the alliance <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> <b>and</b> suffrage movements.|$|E

5|$|The Marietta-class {{monitors}} were {{a pair of}} ironclad river monitors {{laid down}} {{in the summer of}} 1862 for the United States Navy during the American Civil War. Construction was slow, partially for lack <b>of</b> <b>labor,</b> <b>and</b> the ships were not completed until December 1865, after the war was over. However the navy did not accept them until 1866 and immediately laid them up. They were sold in 1873 without ever having been commissioned.|$|E
5|$|After a {{nighttime}} rifle and dynamite attack by striking miners on two mines during the Leadville Miners' Strike in 1896, which succeeded in burning down the surface works {{of one of}} the mines, even the pro-union county sheriff requested Gov. McIntire to send in the state militia, and the WFM lost the strike, and its influence in Leadville. The collapse of the 1896 Leadville strike caused the WFM to sever its relationship with the American Federation <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>and</b> to turn strongly to the left politically. After the Colorado Labor Wars, the WFM was instrumental in launching the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1905, but withdrew from the IWW a few years later. Although the IWW's heyday was short-lived, the union was symbolically important and the ideals embodied by it continue to deeply influence the American labor movement to this day.|$|E
5|$|During Reagan's presidency, {{federal income}} tax rates were lowered {{significantly}} with {{the signing of the}} Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70% to 50% and the lowest bracket from 14% to 11%. Other tax increases passed by Congress and signed by Reagan ensured however that tax revenues over his two terms were 18.2% of GDP as compared to 18.1% over the 40-year period of 1970–2010. Then, in 1982 the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 was signed into law, initiating one of the United States' first public–private partnerships and {{a major part of the}} president's job creation program. Reagan's Assistant Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>and</b> Chief of Staff, Al Angrisani, was a primary architect of the bill.|$|E

5|$|During {{the time}} that Loring was {{proposed}} for closure, the region experienced economic uncertainty. Once the Air Force made its intent known in 1976, property values plummeted, and people delayed buying homes, fearing that {{they would need to}} relocate. The reduction in the base of around 80% meant that possibly 60% of Aroostook County would need to relocate, according to county officials. A $25,000 study, commissioned by the Department <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>and</b> conducted at Northeastern University, calculated that the region had lost over $14 million in these three years of economic uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|He {{soon became}} {{known for his}} {{nationalist}} views. He co-founded the Kilusang Makabansa (National Progress Movement), an organization which frequently spoke out on issues of nationalism and social justice in the 1950s. In 1953, he joined the Magsaysay-for-President Movement, a volunteer group supporting the presidential campaign of Ramon Magsaysay, heading its Executive Planning Committee and working as a speechwriter for candidates of the Nacionalista Party. After Magsaysay's election, he joined the government as {{special assistant to the}} Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>and</b> technical assistant on labor and agrarian affairs.|$|E
5|$|His {{seclusion}} from Syrian politics ended {{after the}} Military Committee of the Ba'ath Party took {{power in a}} coup d'état on 8 March 1963.

He was appointed Minister <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>and</b> Social Affairs in Salah al-Din al-Bitar's first government, and {{became a member of}} the Presidential Council, an organ responsible for running day-to-day state affairs. In February 1964 Atrash was elected to the 12-member Ba'ath Party National Command, which was nominally the highest policy-making body of the party.|$|E

5|$|Images {{of musical}} {{instruments}} begin {{to appear in}} Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, Sumerian and Babylonian cultures began delineating two distinct classes of musical instruments due to division <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> <b>and</b> the evolving class system. Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill. Despite this development, very few musical instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia. Scholars must rely on artifacts and cuneiform texts written in Sumerian or Akkadian to reconstruct {{the early history of}} musical instruments in Mesopotamia. Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, President Barack Obama named {{four women}} to the Cabinet—Arizona {{governor}} Janet Napolitano as Secretary of Homeland Security, former First Lady and New York Senator Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, California Representative Hilda Solis as Secretary <b>of</b> <b>Labor,</b> <b>and</b> Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius as Secretary of Health and Human Services. Clinton became the only First Lady {{to serve in the}} Cabinet and the third female Secretary of State. Napolitano became the first female Secretary of Homeland Security. Barack Obama has appointed eight women to Cabinet positions, the most of any Presidency, surpassing George W. Bush's record of six.|$|E
5|$|She {{was born}} in poverty in the rural village of Los Toldos, in the Pampas, as the {{youngest}} of five children. At 15 in 1934, {{she moved to the}} nation's capital of Buenos Aires to pursue a career as a stage, radio, and film actress. She met Colonel Juan Perón there on 22 January 1944 during a charity event at the Luna Park Stadium to benefit the victims of an earthquake in San Juan, Argentina. The two were married the following year. Juan Perón was elected President of Argentina in 1946; during the next 6 years, Eva Perón became powerful within the pro-Peronist trade unions, primarily for speaking on behalf of labor rights. She also ran the Ministries <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>and</b> Health, founded and ran the charitable Eva Perón Foundation, championed women's suffrage in Argentina, and founded and ran the nation's first large-scale female political party, the Female Peronist Party.|$|E
