5|$|The ruined {{walls of}} the {{observatory}} are a prominent feature on the summit. An emergency shelter has been built {{on top of the}} observatory tower for the benefit of those caught out by bad weather. Although the base of the tower is slightly lower than the true summit of the mountain, the roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> overtops the trig point by several feet, making it the highest man-made structure in the UK. A war memorial to the dead of World War II is located next to the observatory.|$|E
25|$|The {{wall between}} {{the office and}} the former ladies room has since been removed, and the roof is now gabled rather than curved. A World War II photo of the {{building}} shows weatherboard cladding at the north-east end. A goods shed present in the 1954 site plan, north-east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> shed, is no longer extant. A timber stage was located west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> shed {{at the end of}} a siding, on the site of the present car park. A station master's cottage was located within the turning triangle to the south-west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> shed, but this has been replaced by modern buildings for a Queensland Rail (QR) maintenance gang.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} is supported on cylindrical reinforced concrete pillars.

25|$|At Stoney Creek Station, a {{gatehouse}} {{was erected}} in 1909. By 1911 the complex included an open shelter shed with an enclosed office, plus a ladies' {{room with a}} curved roof to the east. By 1936 the complex consisted <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> shed; ladies' room; a water tank for steam trains, supplied from Stoney Creek Falls and a sand shed (west end of station); plus two fettler's camping quarters and a trolley and tool shed (either side of track, east end of station). Only the shelter shed, the water tank and the sand shed survive. The latter was once used to refill sandboxes on trains, which enabled dry sand to be dropped onto the tracks to assist traction. In the 1980s a telephone line and its poles were removed. The siding is used by QR maintenance gangs to wait for tourist trains to pass, and the shelter shed is used when it is raining. Exotic plantings in the station's gardens have being replaced by natives, {{in keeping with the}} National Park, although mature mango trees of heritage significance have been retained.|$|E
25|$|Set {{off from}} the main {{building}} by approximately 13 metres to the north-west and south-east are two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating that faces both tracks. Four steel T-shaped components support steel perforated purlins, which inturn support the corrugated metal roof sheeting. The former divide the seating lengths. Set about {{four and a half}} metres apart, they are made with two cantilevered, tapering I-beams bolted to a rectangular hollow steel column (made with two C-sections welded together) which is founded in a concrete upstand. A perpendicular upstand runs the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> along the midline. Welded to the steel columns and beams are lighter steel frames. The infill panels of glass have been removed, as have some of the steel ones, while others are corroded. The seating is made with painted timber slats supported on timber studs and some steel framing. The downpipes taking water from the box gutter continue the rhythm of the columns, piercing the timber caps that join the two sides of seating at the centre of each gap.|$|E

25|$|At {{this time}} {{following}} {{attempts by the}} Lithuanian government to draft yeshiva students into the army, the Lithuanian Hebron Yeshiva (Knesses Yisroel) relocated to Hebron, after consultations between Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, Yechezkel Sarna and Moshe Mordechai Epstein. and by 1929 had attracted some 265 students from Europe and the United States. The majority of the Jewish population lived {{on the outskirts of}} Hebron along the roads to Be'ersheba and Jerusalem, renting homes owned by Arabs, a number of which were built {{for the express purpose of}} housing Jewish tenants, with a few dozen within the city around the synagogues. During the 1929 Hebron massacre, Arab rioters slaughtered some 64 to 67 Jewish men, women and children and wounded 60, and Jewish homes and synagogues were ransacked; 435 Jews survived by virtue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> and assistance offered them by their Arab neighbours, who hid them. Some Hebron Arabs, including Ahmad Rashid al-Hirbawi, president of Hebron chamber of commerce, supported the return of Jews after the massacre. Two years later, 35 families moved back into the ruins of the Jewish quarter, but on the eve of the Palestinian Arab revolt (April 23, 1936) the British Government decided to move the Jewish community out of Hebron as a precautionary measure to secure its safety. The sole exception was the 8th generation Hebronite Ya'akov ben Shalom Ezra, who processed dairy products in the city, blended in well with its social landscape and resided there under the protection of friends. In November 1947, in anticipation of the UN partition vote, the Ezra family closed its shop and left the city. Yossi Ezra has since tried to regain his family's property through the Israeli courts.|$|E

500|$|The {{station was}} {{selected}} for use as an underground bunker in early 1939 {{as part of a}} programme of developing deep shelters to protect government operations from bombing in the event of war. The platform faces were bricked up and the enclosed platform areas and space in the circulation passages were divided up into offices, meeting rooms and dormitories. The engineering and structural work was carried out by the London Passenger Transport Board and the fitting-out of the rooms and installation of the power and communications equipment was done by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. A two-person lift was installed in the original emergency stairwell and a telephone exchange, toilets and bathrooms were added. The main occupant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> was the Railway Executive Committee, but it was also used as a shelter by prime minister Winston Churchill and his war cabinet until the Cabinet War Rooms were ready for use.

500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War the Chelsea School of Art was evacuated to Northampton and Moore resigned his teaching post. During the war, Moore produced powerful drawings of Londoners sleeping in the London Underground while sheltering from the Blitz. Kenneth Clark, the chairman of the War Artists' Advisory Committee (WAAC), had previously tried to recruit [...] Moore as a full-time salaried war artist and now agreed to purchase some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> drawings and issued contracts for further examples. The shelter drawings WAAC acquired were completed between the autumn of 1940 and the spring of 1941 and are regarded as among the finest products of the WAAC scheme. In August 1941 WAAC commissioned Moore to draw miners working underground at the Wheldale Colliery in Yorkshire, where his father had worked {{at the start of the}} century. Moore drew the people in the shelters as passively waiting the all-clear while miners aggressively worked the coal-faces. These drawings helped to boost Moore's international reputation, particularly in America where examples were included in the WAAC Britain at War exhibition which toured North America throughout the war.|$|E

From 24 to 27 January 1880, the line was relaid as [...] standard gauge, and on 15 September 1880 a passing loop was brought into use through the station, east of the original track, with a new platform serving it. The new platform had a large shelter and a small signal cabin immediately south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelter,</b> with a footbridge at the south end linking it to the original platform. Both platforms had [...] "half barrel" [...] canopies added. The new [...] "down" [...] platform served trains towards Bristol, while the original [...] "up" [...] platform now served trains towards Portishead. The double track through the station was extended to Portishead Junction from 1883. The station's name was changed to Rownham in March 1891, but reverted to Clifton Bridge in 1910. In 1899 the station was flooded to a depth of several feet (one metre), as were other parts of Bristol. A new signal box with 27 levers was built at the south end of the western platform, with the original cabin taken out of use from 25 August 1907. The signal box contained three token instruments, connected to the line's other signal boxes at Oakwood, [...] and Portishead, so that the Pill or Oakwood boxes could be switched out. The boxes at Clifton Bridge and Portishead were manned 24 hours a day.
