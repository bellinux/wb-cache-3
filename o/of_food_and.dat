5|$|After the storm, the Nicaraguan {{government}} {{declared a}} state of disaster in the North and South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Regions, as well as Tisma in the Masaya Department. The government sheltered those made homeless in Bluefields along the Atlantic coast. Relief efforts were coordinated by the Comité Nacional de Emergencia to provide aid to the affected storm victims. Officials sent medical crews to the hardest hit areas. This was due to an increased potential for the spread of water-born diseases, the result of ongoing floods and damaged sanitation facilities. Meanwhile, planes flew overhead {{to determine the extent of}} damage. On August18, the government requested international assistance to cope from the disaster. In response, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the UNDP sent US$70,000 in emergency aid, some of which to be used for fuel to transport medicine and food. The World Food Programme sent 72tons <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> milk. The countries of Japan and the United States were the first to respond; the former provided $100,000, and the latter sent a Lockheed C-130 Hercules to distribute food. Switzerland later sent US$81,000 as a cash donation, while the European Economic Community sent US$227,000 worth <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> medicine. After Tropical Storm Gert struck in early September, various other countries sent additional money, food, medicine, and other goods.|$|E

5|$|As Carlson's {{battalion}} {{was ending}} its patrol, Shōji and his surviving troops were reaching friendly positions {{west of the}} Matanikau. In addition to the losses sustained from attacks by Carlson's raiders, a lack <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> tropical diseases felled many more of Shōji's men. By the time Shōji's forces reached the Lunga River in mid-November, about halfway to the Matanikau, only 1,300men remained with the main body. When Shōji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau, only 700-800 survivors were still with him. Survivors from Shōji's force later participated in the Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse in December 1942 and January 1943.|$|E
