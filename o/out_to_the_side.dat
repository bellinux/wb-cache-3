5|$|Scottie cramp is an {{autosomal}} recessive hereditary disorder which inhibits the dog's ability to walk. It {{is caused by}} a defect in the pathways in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only show when the particular dog is under some degree of stress. The front legs are pushed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> the back arches and the rear legs overflex, causing the dog to fall should they be moving at speed. The condition is not seizure related, and the dog remains conscious throughout the event, with symptoms abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.|$|E
5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E
25|$|An inshave is {{a similar}} tool with a blade curved <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> between the two handles. It is used to shave wood to form a {{hollowed}} out surface, such as {{the top of a}} chair seat. It is also called a scorp. There are also versions with a single handle.|$|E
5000|$|Suicide no-hander: The rider {{lets go of}} {{only the}} handle bars similar to a tuck no-hander, but rather {{stretches}} his/her arms <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> without tucking <b>the</b> bike.|$|R

50|$|Byzantine icons often show {{readers and}} church singers wearing a stikhar-like garment (more loose and flowing than the modern stikhar) and a pointed hat with <b>the</b> brim pulled <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> This {{distinctive}} garb is now obsolete.|$|R
25|$|An angled shape, like a fat L, {{shows that}} the four fingers are flat (straight and in contact), but bent at 90° from {{the plane of the}} palm. It does not occur as a simple shape, but must include an {{indication}} of where the thumb is, either <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> or touching the tips of the fingers.|$|E
25|$|Tracking {{is where}} skydivers take a body {{position}} {{to achieve a}} high forward speed, allowing them to cover a great distance over the ground. Tracking is also used {{at the end of}} group jumps to achieve separation from other jumpers before parachute deployment. The tracking position involves sweeping the arms <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the body and straightening the legs with the toes pointed.|$|E
25|$|The females {{build the}} nest {{which is a}} {{cup-shaped}} depression in the ground. The nest is lined with pieces of lichen, leaves and moss which can occur naturally or can be added by the female. The nests are generally well hidden in a clump of moss or grass. Males defend the breeding territory by gliding and fluttering above it while making oinking and rattling sounds. When on the ground, the male stretches its wing <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> and raises its tail into the air to display the white patch on its rump. He then walks and runs while repeating a call.|$|E
50|$|In warships, a breastwork is {{the armored}} {{superstructure}} {{in the ship}} that did not extend all <b>the</b> way <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> ship. It was generally only used in ironclad turret ships designed between 1865 and 1880.|$|R
50|$|Ninjemys oweni ("Owen's Ninja Turtle") is an extinct large meiolaniid stem-turtle from Pleistocene Queensland (Australia). It resembled {{its larger}} relative, Meiolania, save {{that the largest}} pair of horns on its head stuck <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides,</b> rather than point backwards.|$|R
50|$|Although very thin, the {{ovipositor}} is a {{tube and}} the egg moves down a minute channel {{in its center}} during egg laying. The outer two filaments are the sheaths which protect the ovipositor. They arc <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> during egg laying.|$|R
25|$|A few {{patients}} {{who have had a}} hip replacement suffer chronic pain after the surgery. Groin pain can develop if the muscle that raises the hip (iliopsoas) rubs against the edge of the acetabular cup. Bursitis can develop at the trochanter where a surgical scar crosses the bone, or if the femoral component used pushes the leg <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> too far. Also some patients can experience pain in cold or damp weather. Incision made {{in the front of the}} hip (anterior approach) can cut a nerve running down the thigh leading to numbness in the thigh and occasionally chronic pain at the point where the nerve was cut (a neuroma).|$|E
25|$|Shoulder (Glenohumeral joint) (shoulder) – Several weaker {{functions}} {{occur at}} the glenohumeral, or shoulder, joint. The biceps brachii weakly assists in forward flexion of the shoulder joint (bringing the arm forward and upwards). It may also contribute to abduction (bringing the arm <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side)</b> when the arm is externally (or laterally) rotated. The short head of the biceps brachii also assists with horizontal adduction (bringing the arm across the body) when the arm is internally (or medially) rotated. Finally, the short head of the biceps brachii, due to its attachment to the scapula (or shoulder blade), assists with stabilization of the shoulder joint when a heavy weight is carried in the arm. The tendon of the long head of the biceps also assists in holding {{the head of the}} humerus in the glenoid cavity.|$|E
25|$|These basic shapes are {{modified}} {{with lines}} jutting from {{their faces and}} corners to represent fingers that are not positioned as described above. Straight lines represent straight fingers (these may be {{at an angle to}} indicate that they are not in line with the palm; if they point toward or away from the signer, they have a diamond shape at the tip); curved lines for curved (cupped) fingers; hooked lines for hooked fingers; right-angle lines, for fingers bent at only one joint; and crossed lines, for crossed fingers, as shown in the chart at right. The pentagon and C are only modified to show that the fingers are spread rather than in contact; the angle is only modified to show whether the thumb touches the finger tips or juts <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b> Although there are some generalizations which can be made for the dozens of other glyphs, which are based on the circle and square, the details are somewhat idiosyncratic and each needs to be memorized.|$|E
5000|$|Second position: {{arms are}} <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> with an angle down and forward, palms facing forward. The elbow is {{slightly}} lower than the shoulder, and the wrist is {{slightly lower than}} the elbow. A position intermediate {{between the first and}} the second position is called demi-seconde.|$|R
50|$|The {{classical}} wooden ski {{consists of}} a single long piece of suitable wood that is hand-carved <b>to</b> produce <b>the</b> required shape. Early designs were generally rectangular in cross-section, with the tip bent up {{through the application of}} steam. Over time the designs changed, and skis were thinned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides,</b> or featured prominent ridges down the center.|$|R
50|$|For {{transporting}} heavier, {{even more}} awkward and moisture-sensitive goods the DB has, since 1964, four-axled wagons with movable roofs. To begin with these were swing-roofs that were divided in two along their longitudinal axis and folded <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> In order <b>to</b> avoid breaching <b>the</b> loading gauge when {{the roof was}} opened, these were abandoned in favour of rolling roofs.|$|R
500|$|By now, Rogers {{has learned}} Astaire's true {{identity}} although {{neither of them}} yet know that her impulsive marriage to Rhodes is null and void. Dining together during carnival night in Venice, and to help assuage her guilt, Astaire declares: [...] "Let's eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow {{we have to face}} him," [...] which serves as the cue for the music of [...] "The Piccolino", the film's big production number. A gondola parade is followed by the entry of a dancing chorus who perform a series of ballroom poses and rippling-pattern routines choroeographed by Hermes Pan. Berlin, who lavished a great deal of effort on the song designed it as a pastiche of [...] "The Carioca" [...] from Flying Down to Rio (1933) and [...] "The Continental" [...] from The Gay Divorcee (1934), and the lyric communicates its fake origin: [...] "It was written by a Latin/A gondolier who sat in/his home out in Brooklyn/and gazed at the stars." [...] It is a song about a song and Rogers sings it to Astaire after which an off-camera chorus repeats it while the dance ensemble is photographed, Busby Berkeley-style, from above. The camera then switches to Rogers and Astaire who bound down to the stage to perform a two-minute dance, all shot in one take, with the Astaire-Pan choreography separately referencing the basic melody and the Latin vamp in the accompaniment. They dance to the accompaniment as they descend the steps and glide along the dance floor, then, when the melody enters, they halt and perform the Piccolino step, which involves the feet darting <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the body. The rest of the dance involves repetitions and variations of the Piccolino step and the hopping steps associated with the vamp, leading to some complex amalgamations of the two. On the vamp melody's final appearance, the dancers perform a highly embellished form of the Piccolino step as they travel sideways back to their table, sinking back into their chairs and lifting their glasses in a toast.|$|E

2500|$|Hirsch's father later recalled: [...] "We lived {{two miles}} from school. Elroy ran to school and back, {{skipping}} and crisscrossing his legs in the cement blocks of the sidewalks. He said it would make him shiftier." [...] Hirsch himself recalled: [...] "I've always run kind of funny because my left foot points <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> and I seem to wobble." ...|$|E
25|$|Dinosaurs' limbs were erect {{and held}} under their bodies, rather than {{sprawling}} <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> {{like those of}} lizards and newts. The evidence {{for this is the}} angles of the joint surfaces and the locations of muscle and tendon attachments on <b>the</b> bones. Attempts <b>to</b> represent dinosaurs with sprawling limbs result in creatures with dislocated hips, knees, shoulders and elbows.|$|R

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the tense action of the previous scene, this scene is one of calmness and stillness, showing the palace ladies at their toilette. [...] The focus of the scene is on a lady {{sitting in front of}} a bronze mirror, and with a set of nested lacquer boxes laid <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b> [...] Behind her, another lady helps comb her hair. [...] To the right another lady, facing away from the viewer, looks into a mirror held in her hand, which reflects the lady's visage back to the viewer. [...] The two mirrors in this scene are perhaps intended to be more than just tools for helping with make-up, but mirrors into the souls of the ladies, reflecting their inner nature as much as their external appearance.|$|E
