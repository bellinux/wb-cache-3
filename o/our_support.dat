500|$|The Milton Keynes {{idea was}} very poorly {{received}} by Luton fans and viewed, in Bale's words, as [...] "tearing the club from its most loyal supporters". Luton fans held protest marches and rallies throughout the 1983–84 season, and chartered {{a plane to}} fly over Kenilworth Road during one match pulling a banner reading [...] "Keep Luton Town F.C. in Luton". Some 18,000 Luton residents signed a petition against the club leaving. A consortium of local businessmen attempted to persuade Vauxhall Motors, General Motors' Luton-based British marque, {{to invest in the}} club and help with a new stadium in Luton. In Milton Keynes, some residents expressed fears that Luton's arrival in central Milton Keynes might bring with it football hooliganism and threaten local amenities. Some Luton supporters boycotted the club's first home match of the 1984–85 season in protest against the Milton Keynes plans. The wide unpopularity of the proposed move and the consistently vehement opposition from Luton's local support combined to prevent it from occurring. [...] "The directors want <b>our</b> <b>support</b> and our money," [...] said Tom Hunt, a member of a Luton fans' action group against the move, [...] "but they ignore the views of a community that wants to keep its football club. Why should fans pay at the turnstiles to help the club in business {{so that it can be}} taken away from us?" ...|$|E

Main {{purpose of this}} system is to present visual aids drawn on a pool table through LCD display of a camera mounted handheld device without any artificial marker.

Using these natural features, the registration of visual aids such as shooting direction and ball behavior is achieved. Also, <b>our</b> <b>supporting</b> information is computed based on the rules of pool games and includes the next shooting way by simulating ball behavior.
