5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by {{features of the}} skull. On {{the tip of a}} ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) <b>ossification,</b> unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as a mirror image of the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This <b>ossification</b> evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out sideways, making the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof, to form the neck frill.|$|E
5|$|In animals, OCD is {{considered}} a developmental and metabolic disorder related to cartilage growth and endochondral <b>ossification.</b> Osteochondritis itself signifies the disturbance of the usual growth process of cartilage, and OCD is the term used when this affects joint cartilage causing a fragment to become loose.|$|E
5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} supply to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered <b>ossification</b> of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E
40|$|Background: The term {{myositis}} ossificans {{refers to}} the formation of <b>ossifications</b> in the muscles, ligaments and fascias, usually as a result of trauma. Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is a rare genetic disease in which heterotopic <b>ossifications</b> appear in early childhood and are accompanied by feet and spine defects. Case Report: We present a case of a 31 -year-old woman with massive heterotopic <b>ossifications</b> who suffered multiple injuries. We would like to emphasize the role of computed tomography in the exact localization of <b>ossifications.</b> Conclusions: Thanks to the volume rendering techniques and 3 D image reconstructions, it is possible to precisely determine the position of <b>ossifications</b> in relation to the internal organs and blood vessels, allowing to schedule the surgery to remove the lesions...|$|R
30|$|<b>Ossifications</b> around {{implants}} in non-fusion constructs for early-onset spine deformities occur but are underreported [14, 21]. Two-thirds of {{our patients}} showed <b>ossifications,</b> which is a slightly higher rate than previously reported [14]. Half of those <b>ossifications</b> were situated around the anchors. Half of the patients without pre-existing rib fusions developed <b>ossifications</b> along the implant overlying the ribs. Re-ossifications of thoracostomies were less frequent (15  %). Undue pooling of those subtypes results in {{a high incidence of}} a generally harmless issue, so {{there is a need to}} categorize, as pathogenesis and functional and therapeutic sequelae may vary.|$|R
30|$|Implant-related <b>ossifications</b> around VEPTR are common. In {{contrast}} to harmless bone formation around anchors, <b>ossifications</b> around the telescopic part and the rod section are troublesome {{in view of}} their possible negative impact on chest cage compliance and spinal mobility. This potential side effect needs to be considered during implant selection, particularly in patients with originally normal thoracic and spinal anatomy.|$|R
5|$|Some {{conformation}} flaws {{common in}} the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy forehand and overangulated hind legs. Another problem that affects some Finnhorses {{is a tendency to}} trot with the front and hind legs directly in line with other, which creates a high probability of forging, where the hind hooves hit the front pasterns, which can cause breaking gait. This can be helped to a degree with careful shoeing. There is also a tendency toward <b>ossification</b> of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to increase with age, and appears to be heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the foot, is common in draught breeds. However, a study of affected Finnhorses also noted that horses with long toes and low heels were common and <b>ossification</b> correlated with the length of the heels.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{specimens}} of Pinacosaurus {{of different ages}} found that during ontogenetic development, the ribs of juvenile ankylosaurs fused with their vertebrae. The forelimbs strongly increased in robustness, while the hindlimbs did not become larger relative {{to the rest of}} the skeleton, further evidence that the arms bore most of the weight. In the cervical halfrings, the underlying bone band developed outgrowths connecting it with the underlying osteoderms, which simultaneously fused to each other. On the skull, the middle bone plates first ossified at the snout and the rear rim; gradually the <b>ossification</b> extended towards the middle regions. On the rest of the body, the <b>ossification</b> process progressed from the neck onwards in the direction of the tail. Young ankylosaurs are commonly found together but adults are found separate, suggesting they were solitary.|$|E
5|$|X-rays show lucency of the <b>ossification</b> {{front in}} juveniles. In older people, the lesion {{typically}} appears {{as an area}} of osteosclerotic bone with a radiolucent line between the osteochondral defect and the epiphysis. The visibility of the lesion depends on its location and {{on the amount of}} knee flexion used. Harding described the lateral X-ray as a method to identify the site of an OCD lesion.|$|E
3000|$|... • The pelvis and hip {{are common}} {{locations}} of heterotopic <b>ossifications</b> (HO), often occurring in paraplegic patients.|$|R
5000|$|Spine (33% of patients): Segmental, usually {{involving}} the thoracic spine. The four main presentations include spondylodiscitis, osteosclerosis, paravertebral <b>ossifications,</b> and sacroiliac joint involvement.|$|R
30|$|The {{first step}} is to {{differentiate}} calcifications from <b>ossifications</b> or foreign bodies. One can achieve this goal by analysing its density, shape and pattern.|$|R
5|$|Many Gobioolithus minor {{specimens}} contain embryonic {{remains of}} the enantiornithine genus Gobipipus. The embryos have well-ossified skeletons, implying that they were at a late stage in development when they died. Their wings and shoulders are especially well-developed. Only the modern megapodes and the little tern exhibit a comparable degree of embryonic <b>ossification</b> in the arm and shoulder bones. It is likely that Gobipipus hatchlings, like megapodes and little terns, {{would be able to}} fly very soon after hatching.|$|E
5|$|A few Macroolithus eggs {{preserve}} embryonic {{remains of}} oviraptorids inside. Two eggs containing embryos {{found in the}} Upper Cretaceous Nanxiong Formation near Ganzhou, Jiangxi were referred to M. yaotunensis in 2008. One of these embryos shows a much greater degree of bone development (<b>ossification)</b> than the other; it preserves ossified hind limbs and several vertebrae. The fact that the cervical vertebrae not only have ossified centra and neural arches, but also have ossified zygapophyses, led Cheng et al. to conclude that this embryo may in fact represent a hatchling, since in modern chickens and skuas these zygaphyses are cartilaginous until hatching. Also, the embryo's foot anatomy (specifically, the proportions of its metatarsals) resembles that of the oviraptorid Heyuannia huangi, indicating that these eggs belong to H. huangi or a similar species. The other egg has a much less developed embryo, with only the hind limbs preserved. While this does not permit comparison on the species level, the tibia (shinbone) confirms {{that it is an}} oviraptorosaur.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{occurs in}} 15 to 30 people per 100,000 {{in the general}} {{population}} each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active adolescents. Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents {{can be attributed to the}} bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. Franz König coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an inflammation of the bone–cartilage interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, osteonecrosis, accessory <b>ossification</b> center, osteochondrosis, and hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia. Some authors have used the terms osteochondrosis dissecans and osteochondral fragments as synonyms for OCD.|$|E
30|$|Joint {{involvement}} {{is characterized by}} arthritis, with joint space narrowing and, sometimes, erosions. There might be periarticular osteopenia. Ligamentous <b>ossifications</b> can be observed as well [32, 37].|$|R
30|$|The radiographs made at {{follow-up}} showed no degenerative changes or periarticular <b>ossifications.</b> Despite anterior subluxation or restricted motion, no patient wanted additional surgical treatment, mainly {{because all the}} elbows were painless.|$|R
30|$|Only 15  % of the {{patients}} who had undergone an opening-wedge thoracostomy {{at the time of}} the index procedure showed re-closing of the intercostal gap. These <b>ossifications</b> are re-fusions and are not directly related to the implant but rather to the proximity to bleeding bone surfaces and the stability after VEPTR placement. We recommend a careful preoperative look at the radiograph. In cases of suspected re-ossification, a CT scan should be performed. Intraoperatively, the implant should be checked for adjacent <b>ossifications.</b> If confirmed, a re-osteotomy at the time of scheduled implant lengthening provides optimal expansion of the thorax [11].|$|R
5|$|Temnospondyls like Sclerocephalus {{are known}} from both large adult {{specimens}} and small larvae, showing an extreme change in body shape. In these species, {{the shape and}} proportions of skull bones change {{in the early stages}} of development. The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time. Small, regularly spaced pits are the first to form, followed by larger ridges. As development continues, the external gills disappear. Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost. The postcranial skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull, with <b>ossification</b> (the replacement of cartilage by bone) happening more slowly. Vertebrae and limb bones are poorly developed, ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages, and the scapulocoracoid and ischium are entirely absent through most of development. Once maturity is reached, most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows. The bones of some temnospondyls like Dutuitosaurus show growth marks, possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons. Fossils of temnospondyls like Metoposaurus and Cheliderpeton show that individuals grew larger past maturity. The oldest individuals usually have more pitting on their skulls with deeper sulci.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{preparation}} method pioneered by the Royal Ontario Museum removes all bones {{for a complete}} skeleton while also producing a round skin without bill or legs (called a ROM, though if one set of wing and leg bones remain with the skin the preparation is called a shmoo in North America). Alternatively, the entire bird (or any soft parts associated with preparations described above) may be preserved in alcohol. For any of these methods, several supplemental preparations may be made. For example, a wing may be removed and preserved separately as a spread wing for better study of flight feathers; a tissue sample may be removed and frozen for molecular analyses; or a recording of the bird's song before collection may be archived. Neither molecular samples nor sound recordings require a bird to be collected (killed). Finally, if the bird is too rotten for the skin and feathers to be preserved, {{as is the case}} with some salvaged specimens, the skeleton alone may be preserved. Dried tissue is removed from skeletons by using dermestid beetle larvae (genus Dermestes). Whereas in the past arsenic was routinely added to skins to protect them from destruction by insects, specimens prepared today are generally protected by an initial freezing period to kill insects and their eggs followed by keeping them in high-quality museum cases in a climate-controlled room. Each specimen has data associated with it, and the amount of data available is usually directly correlated with the specimen’s scientific value. Most specimens are of little value for research without accompanying information, such as the time and place the bird was found or collected. This and other important information, such as mass, sex, fat deposition, and degree of skull <b>ossification,</b> is written on a label along with a unique field and museum number. Modern computerized museum databases include all of this information for each specimen, as well as the types of methods used to prepare the bird. Modern collections seek to maximize the utility of each preserved individual, and this includes recording detailed information about it. Most modern specimens also include a tissue sample preserved for genetic study. Online access to collections’ data is becoming increasingly available, and a cross-institutional database covering millions of computerized bird records is in development.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of bone is called <b>ossification.</b> During the fetal {{stage of development}} this occurs by two processes: intramembranous <b>ossification</b> and endochondral <b>ossification.</b> Intramembranous <b>ossification</b> involves the {{formation of}} bone from connective tissue whereas endochondral <b>ossification</b> involves the formation of bone from cartilage.|$|E
30|$|No {{heterotopic}} <b>ossifications</b> {{were detected}} (these are bone formations {{which are not}} in contact with {{any part of the}} implant, and do not occur in the regions of former osteotomies of congenital rib fusions).|$|R
30|$|Dural calcifications and <b>ossifications,</b> {{especially}} of the falx cerebri, can also appear as “brain stones”. They generally {{do not have any}} clinical significance and are often incidental findings during CT scans of the brain [28]. Dural calcifications, which are a result of calcium salt deposition, {{should not be confused with}} dural <b>ossifications,</b> which actually involves new bone formation [29]. As the falx is derived from multipotential mesenchymal cells, they may become osteogenic after exposure to friction, haemorrhage or trauma [29, 30]. <b>Ossifications</b> in the falx cerebri are considered to be a rare phenomenon [9, 31, 32]. However, their incidence may be underestimated as it has been shown that a percentage of previously identified dense calcification on conventional radiography and CT may actually possess an outer shell of cortical bone surrounding an inner core of (fatty) bone marrow using modern high-resolution CT and MR imaging [28, 31, 32]. They can range in size from small islands of bone to large bony structures, can involve the entire falx [29, 33] and can be associated with certain endocrine and congenital disorders [30, 33].|$|R
40|$|Here we {{describe}} a new diminutive varanoid from the Late Cretaceous Djadoktha Formation of Omnogov, Mongolia. The new taxon, Ovoo gurval, {{was found in}} the Nemegt Basin at the locality of Little Ukhaa, a locality adjacent to the rich fossil beds of Ukhaa Tolgod. The new varanoid is similar to Aiolosaurus oriens, another small varanoid from the Ukhaa Tolgod locality and several diagnostic characters of Ovoo gurval are shared with Aiolosaurus oriens. Ovoo gurval also has a pair of unusual neomorphic <b>ossifications</b> on the skull roof overlying the frontonasal contact. Positionally, these are unlike any neomorphic <b>ossifications</b> in other squamates, and certainly can be distinguished from osteoderms found in some varanoids...|$|R
25|$|During {{mandible}} development, {{most of it}} {{is formed}} through intramembranous <b>ossification,</b> where endochondral <b>ossification</b> will occur in the proximal region.|$|E
25|$|Intramembranous <b>ossification</b> mainly {{occurs during}} {{formation}} of the flat bones of the skull but also the mandible, maxilla, and clavicles; the bone is formed from connective tissue such as mesenchyme tissue rather than from cartilage. The process includes: {{the development of the}} <b>ossification</b> center, calcification, trabeculae formation and the development of the periosteum.|$|E
25|$|Endochondral <b>ossification</b> {{occurs in}} long bones {{and most other}} bones in the body; it {{involves}} the development of bone from cartilage. This process includes {{the development of a}} cartilage model, its growth and development, development of the primary and secondary <b>ossification</b> centers, and the formation of articular cartilage and the epiphyseal plates.|$|E
30|$|In {{an attempt}} to shed further light on those findings, we studied the type and {{occurrence}} of heterotopic and periprosthetic <b>ossifications</b> 4 years after VEPTR implantation in a cohort of patients recruited from four international VEPTR centres.|$|R
50|$|Children with {{autosomal}} dominant MED experience joint pain and fatigue after exercising. Their x-rays show small and irregular <b>ossifications</b> centers, most {{apparent in the}} hips and knees. A waddling gait may develop. Flat feet are very common.|$|R
50|$|As an ankylosaurid, Tarchia {{would have}} had a broad, low-slung body, {{positioned}} on strong short legs. The body would have been protected by skin <b>ossifications,</b> named osteoderms. It probably had a bony tail club, for active defence against predators.|$|R
25|$|The <b>ossification</b> of Lunate bone commences between 18 {{months and}} 4 years and 3 months.|$|E
25|$|The {{snow leopard}} cannot roar, despite {{possessing}} partial <b>ossification</b> of the hyoid bone. This partial <b>ossification</b> was previously {{thought to be}} essential for allowing the big cats to roar, but new {{studies show that the}} ability to roar is due to other morphological features, especially of the larynx, which are absent in the snow leopard. Snow leopard vocalizations include hisses, chuffing, mews, growls, and wailing.|$|E
25|$|Ornithischian {{backbones}} were stiffened {{near the}} pelvis by the <b>ossification</b> of tendons above the sacrum. Additionally, ornithischians {{had at least}} five sacral vertebrae attaching to the pelvis.|$|E
50|$|For the {{ossificans}} {{form of the}} condition, unenhanced CT may better {{show the}} presence and extent of arachnoid <b>ossifications,</b> and is complementary to MRI, as MRI can be less specific and findings can be confused with regions of calcification or hemosiderin.|$|R
30|$|Implant-related <b>ossifications</b> after VEPTR {{operations}} for early-onset spine deformities (EOS) are common and occur {{within the first}} years after the index procedure [14]. Our findings aid understanding of the possible limitations of either extra- or juxtaspinal growth-retaining stiff implants [1, 16, 19, 24, 25, 28, 29]. Stabilizing bone formation around the rib-, spine- and ileum-based anchor points is a seemingly harmless local reaction to the polyaxiality and the non-fusion strategy. In contrast, <b>ossifications</b> around the central telescoping part and the rod section of the construct are troublesome since they bridge ribs and spinal segments, leading to potential negative impacts on chest cage compliance and spinal mobility. This phenomenon of unwanted extraspinal fusion needs to be considered when the implant employed to correct the EOS is chosen, since it may corrupt the non-fusion philosophy, particularly in patients with originally normal thoracic and spinal anatomy. Resection of such <b>ossifications</b> when the central portion is replaced or {{at the time of}} conversion into a definitive instrumented fusion should be taken into consideration and weighed against the option of leaving it as a precursor and alternative to the final fusion [21, 24].|$|R
30|$|The <b>ossifications</b> found {{above and}} within the {{substance}} of the tendon {{may be the result of}} a transformation of mesenchymal cells to bone-forming cells in response to the surgical excision of the calcium deposit and suturing of the tendon during the arthroscopic procedure.|$|R
