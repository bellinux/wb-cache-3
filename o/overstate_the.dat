5|$|Larger boats {{entering}} Padstow {{were offered}} assistance, generally by pilots who would wait at Stepper Point when a ship signalled {{it would be}} entering. If a boat was foundering, salvors would step in and help. There were cases where salvors attempted to <b>overstate</b> <b>the</b> danger in court, so as to extort more money from the owners. This happened to the brig The Towan, which foundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger. Although it did not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner.|$|E

As the first black-Native sculptor of either sex to achieve international recognition within a western sculptural tradition, Lewis was a symbolic and social anomaly within a dominantly white bourgeois and aristocratic community.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} {{question}} as to whether having children really is such a positive contribution to the world in an age when there are many concerns about overpopulation, pollution and depletion of non-renewable resources. Some critics counter that such analyses of having children may understate its potential benefits to society (e.g. a greater labor force, which may provide greater opportunity to solve social problems) and <b>overstate</b> <b>the</b> costs. That is, there is often a need for a non-zero birth rate.|$|E

25|$|The legal {{history of}} the court is {{commonly}} summarised by reference to the Chief Justice of the time. While it is a convenient way of breaking the {{history of the}} Court into periods, it tends to <b>overstate</b> <b>the</b> importance of the Chief Justice and ignores the influence and tenure of other members of the Court. For example, Isaacs J was the primary force in the Knox Court, while the time of his own appointment as Chief Justice saw the emergence of Dixon J as the new intellectual leader of the Court.|$|E
25|$|The metaphysical and cosmological {{significance}} of marriage within Islam – particularly within Sufism or Islamic mysticism – {{is difficult to}} <b>overstate.</b> <b>The</b> relationship and interplay {{between male and female}} is viewed as nothing less than that between heaven (represented by the husband) and earth (symbolised by the wife). Because of her beauty and virtue, the earth is eminently lovable: heaven marries her not simply out of duty, but for pleasure and joy. Marriage and sexual intercourse are not merely human phenomena, but the universal power of productivity found within every level of existence: sex within marriage is the supreme instance of witnessing God in the full splendour of His self-disclosure.|$|E
25|$|An oft-cited {{academic}} paper (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005) {{suggests that}} the net-of-fees returns to PE funds are roughly comparable to the S 500 (or even slightly under). This analysis may actually <b>overstate</b> <b>the</b> returns because it relies on voluntarily reported data and hence suffers from survivorship bias (i.e. funds that fail won't report data). One should also note that these returns are not risk-adjusted. A more recent paper (Harris, Jenkinson and Kaplan, 2012) found that average buyout fund returns in the U.S. have actually exceeded that of public markets. These findings were supported by earlier work, using a different data set (Robinson and Sensoy, 2011).|$|E
25|$|Proponents {{and opponents}} have been both criticized for <b>overstating</b> <b>the</b> {{benefits}} or <b>overstating</b> <b>the</b> risks, and understating the other, respectively. Systematic reviews have cited {{the lack of}} high quality research for the benefits and risks of water fluoridation and questions that are still unsettled. Researchers who oppose the practice state this as well. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report on fluoride in drinking water, these gaps in the fluoridation scientific literature fuel the controversy.|$|R

Gilmour called him [...] "my musical partner and my friend", praised {{the ability of the}} two men's voices to blend, such as on [...] "Echoes".

500|$|Robert Cardus was {{a retired}} policeman; to augment his small pension the family took in neighbours' washing, and the {{household}} income was further supplemented by his daughters' earnings from part-time prostitution. In his autobiographical writings, Cardus refers {{to his home}} environment at Summer Place as [...] "sordid... unlettered and unbeautiful", yet enlivened by laughter: [...] "Humour kept breezing in". Commentators have suggested that Cardus tended to <b>overstate</b> <b>the</b> deprived aspects of his childhood; his biographer Christopher Brookes asserts that [...] "Cardus was the product neither of a slum, nor a cultural desert". Robert Cardus, though uneducated, was not illiterate, and was instrumental in awakening his grandson's literary interests.

He {{surprised}} the Olympic and World champion with a resounding victory, beating him with 9.84 to Bolt's 9.97seconds. This was {{only the second time}} Bolt had lost a 100m final – the first occurring in July 2008 against Powell (also at Stockholm Olympic Stadium). Gay broke Powell's stadium record and earned a one carat diamond for the feat. Gay chose not to <b>overstate</b> <b>the</b> significance of the win, acknowledging that Bolt was far from peak fitness: [...] "It feels great to beat Usain but deep down inside I know he is not 100%. I look forward to beating him when he is". With Bolt and Powell both out with injuries, Gay won unchallenged at the London Grand Prix the following week, running a world leading time of 9.78seconds despite poor weather. A victory at the Memorial van Damme in 9.79seconds earned him the first Diamond Race Trophy for the 100m.|$|E
500|$|Upon the 30th {{anniversary of}} the album's release, Julian Kimble of Billboard {{magazine}} wrote: [...] "In hindsight, Control is both evolutionary and revolutionary. As Jackson’s first album to land atop the Billboard 200, it marked professional and personal breakthroughs. Distancing herself from the immense Jackson family shadow, she created {{one of the most}} influential projects across contemporary R and pop music. And not only was Jackson’s maiden voyage with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis at the forefront of R, pop and hip-hop’s intersection, it birthed a novel sound in the process." [...] MTV's Meaghan Garvey asserted [...] "it’s hard to <b>overstate</b> <b>the</b> significance of Control, whether in terms of the pop landscape, the evolution of the music video as a vessel for promotion and expression, or Top 40 feminist anthems." [...] She also argued [...] "it’s important to note that Control’s self-actualization anthems were expressions of black female pride. Control spawned a whopping six videos—great ones, at that—which played an immeasurable role in the shift toward visible black pop." [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of Los Angeles Times wrote that Jackson's continued influence is evident in the careers of Rihanna, Beyoncé, Ciara, FKA Twigs and Tinashe in that [...] "all of them take cues from Jackson's blueprint. And all that began with Control." ...|$|E
500|$|Much {{speculation}} {{appeared in}} the press as {{to the cause of}} Ellen's illness; some linked the case to that of Sarah Jacob, a girl from Wales who, her parents claimed, was able to survive without nourishment, through divine intervention. Sarah died of starvation in 1869, and her parents were subsequently convicted of manslaughter. A journalist for The Observer commented, [...] "It is to be hoped that [...] is known in the obscure village of Turville, where—we are asked to believe—a fresh case of miraculous trance has taken place.... very much... incites suspicion of deliberate imposture." [...] One correspondent to The Times wrote, [...] "It is by widespread publicity that such cases are multiplied, {{and it is difficult to}} <b>overstate</b> <b>the</b> harm thus done. These impostures exist through a morbid love of sympathy on the part of the children, or from the gains that accrue to the parents. Once begun, they soon pass into real disease." [...] Another said the [...] "ridiculous mystery" [...] could be resolved if only Ellen were transferred, over her mother's continued objections, to a London hospital, a sentiment echoed by many. Claims that Ellen was suffering from a form of catalepsy—a condition at the time considered [...] "so rare that not one physician in a thousand has so much as seen a single case of it"—were also disregarded as unlikely, as was any thought of religious ecstasy.|$|E

500|$|The {{publicity}} {{surrounding the}} allegations had a drastic effect on Cosby's reputation, {{as seen in}} the following drop in his ratings. In March 2013, Cosby had a 76.3 rating on the Davie-Brown Index, a rating of the public perceptions of roughly 3500 personalities published by Omnicom Group company The Marketing Arm, placing him as the third most-trusted celebrity, behind Morgan Freeman and Dr. Mehmet Oz. By November 19, this had fallen to 57.1, placing him at either the 2,626th spot or 2615th, depending on the source. The same company's separate rating on who consumers view as an [...] "effective product spokesperson" [...] saw Cosby drop to 2,746th spot; at one point, he had been 5th. Awareness of Cosby increased from 63rd to 51st. The Marketing Arm warns about misinterpreting the ratings fall; it said 900 celebrities were within the margin of error for Cosby's rating. At the time of the accusations, E-Poll Market Research had not updated its scores; a Q Score for Cosby was not expected until 2015. The executive vice-president of Q Scores Co. said polling {{in the midst of a}} scandal would likely <b>overstate</b> <b>the</b> score's longterm effects. All three companies' scores are updated at different intervals, meaning they are not directly comparable. Jell-O was relatively unaffected on social media by allegations against Cosby. The brand was mentioned in one percent of posts about Cosby, which was considered low. Still, negative connections continued, including by rapper Eminem in a freestyle rap, and an article by Food Drink and Franchise magazine pointed out moments in commercials that were awkward in retrospect.|$|E
