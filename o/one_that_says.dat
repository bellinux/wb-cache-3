During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan as well as another {{passenger}} in a momentary panic, then commits suicide out of guilt. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation. A few months later, Fox vice-president Scott Neeson went to Dalbeattie, Scotland, where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology, and also presented a £5000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school's William Murdoch Memorial Prize. Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary, but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the [...] "women and children first" [...] policy. According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an [...] "honorable man," [...] not of a man [...] "gone bad" [...] or of a [...] "cowardly murderer." [...] He added, [...] "I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today.
