However documented evidence on ND virus activity in rural poultry in Ghana is still lacking. Hence, this study was conducted to evaluate the level of circulating antibodies against ND using the Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) technique. Sera collected from unvaccinated 292 chickens and 153 guinea fowls randomly selected from households and a live bird market in Kumasi and its environs were evaluated for Newcastle disease virus antibodies. Results showed 81. 8 % (239 / 292) of local chickens and 24. 2 % (37 / 153) <b>of</b> <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> tested positive for ND antibodies. Comparison was made between the seroprevalence of ND antibodies in household and live bird market as well as between sexes.

Higher ranges of titers were also observed in chickens from households than those from live bird markets. The presence of ND antibodies in these unvaccinated local chickens and guinea fowls indicated the presence of the virus amongst the rural poultry population, hence aneed for improvement in vaccine campaignand delivery against ND for rural poultry especially with the use of thermostable and improved oral or feed-based vaccine delivery systems...|$|E
40|$|Avian Metapneumovirus (AMPV) subtype A and B affect mainly turkeys and chickens. However, also {{pheasants}} and {{guinea fowls}} {{are susceptible to}} natural and experimental infection. In this report an outbreak of respiratory disease, which occurred in February 2012 in a flock <b>of</b> <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> located in an highly populated poultry area of Northern Italy, is described. An AMPV of subtype B, named aMPV/B/IT/GuineaFowl/ 1818 / 12, was isolated from oro-pharingeal swabs in chicken embryo tracheal organ cultures, and typed by a subtype specific qRT-PCR. In order to characterize the strain, the F and G genes were sequenced. Nucleotide sequences were edited and assembled using Bioedit software then aligned against analogous gene sequences of AMPV subtype B isolated in Italy or deposited/published on Genbank using Clustal W. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out under distance criterion, with neighbourjoining as algorithm, using MEGA 4 software. Bootstrap values were obtained with 1. 000 replicates. Branches with bootstrapping values > 70 were considered significant. The trees constructed on alignments of sequence data sets of F and G genes showed that the isolate clustered with other AMPVs of subtype B isolated in Italy from turkeys and chickens after 2000. These findings do not support genetic differences correlated to the host tropism and suggest that circulation of closely related AMPV strains occurs among different avian species in densely poultry populated areas. Managerial and environmental factors involved in determining the disease outbreak are discussed...|$|E

Age-related changes were analysed using univariate analysis for completely randomised design and means separated using Tukey's test/Kruskal-Wallis test and medians separated by Mann-Whitney U test. Total germ cell population per testis and testicular histological morphometric parameters increased significantly (p <  0. 0001) from 12 weeks of age (WOA), and stabilized between 20 and 24 WOA. Peripheral testosterone concentrations increased gradually from 4 WOA, and peaked at 20 WOA. Correlations among all the testicular morphometric parameters were positive and highly significant (p <  0. 01). Similarly, significant (p <  0. 05) positive correlations existed between testicular weight and testicular sperm production, tubular diameter, Sertoli cell population, tubular length and peripheral testosterone concentration. Testicular sperm production was positively correlated with meiotic index (p <  0. 01) and round spermatids population (p <  0. 05). The correlations between peripheral testosterone concentrations, tubular diameter and Sertoli efficiency were also significant (p <  0. 05) and positive. Testicular morphometric parameters stabilized between 20 and 24 WOA, while peripheral testosterone concentrations showed two patterns of secretion, initial and final phases of increasing and decreasing testosterone secretions, respectively, and may be implicated in the development of histological structures of the testes and spermatogenesis.

40|$|Good feeding for {{guinea fowl}} Cue: Our next report comes from Blantyre in Malawi, where Patrick Mphaka {{reports on the}} growing {{popularity}} of guinea fowl among village poultry keepers. One reason for this popularity is a reported resistance of guinea fowl in Malawi to a major poultry disease, Newcastle disease, which every year has a devastating impact on unvaccinated poultry flocks. While this reported resistance may reflect a greater hardiness in guinea fowl to some common diseases, guinea fowl are, in fact vulnerable to Newcastle disease, in common with nearly all poultry species, and those keeping guinea fowl should follow appropriate steps to keep their birds disease free. IN:		?Traditionally, popular domestic birds? OUT:		?. Newcastle which troubles our chickens. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 00 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Village headman Magombo Ngondo ending that report on a community guinea fowl project in his village. Please note that while in his experience, guinea fowl are more resistant to Newcastle disease, veterinary advice suggests that guinea fowl are, in fact, vulnerable to the disease, in common with other poultry. Transcript Mphaka	Traditionally, popular domestic birds kept by most people here are chickens. These have their advantages, and, naturally, their disadvantages. One of the most menacing problems for the poor lot of chicken keepers is the seasonal outbreak of Newcastle disease. It is a big problem for most people because though easily preventable when appropriate vaccination is supplied to the birds, most of them can not afford it. The result is death en masse of chickens once or twice each year. 		Due to this problem, most people are turning their attention to alternative birds. To this end, the introduction <b>of</b> <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> in some areas has become handy. To date, there are no locally known diseases which attack guinea fowls. This quality directly solves the problem most bird keepers have been having with chickens. Since the retail price <b>of</b> <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> is higher than that of chickens, it has not been easy for most people to start rearing guinea fowls. There are some instances, however, where Non-Governmental organizations have intervened in introducing the birds to some communities. One such community is in Magombo Ngondo village in Traditional Authority Kuntaja in Blantyre district. The community here was given some twenty birds to keep on community level and that as the birds multiply, they can start sharing amongst themselves. I paid the village headman a visit {{to learn more about the}} feeding practices, among other relevant issues. Ngondo	[Vernac] As far as feeding is concerned, we provide them with food two or three times each day within the stall before we release them to fend for themselves outside. In addition, we also ensure that the water containers which you see there are cleaned and filled with clean water each day. We feed these guinea fowls with maize bran, sorghum, or sometimes we look for white ants, so that we are sure that when they are going to fend for themselves, they have already had enough food. Mphaka	You told me earlier that sometimes these birds are 100 % stall fed, and sometimes, like this period, they are on semi-free range. Would you elaborate on that? Ngondo	We stall feed them 100 % when we have just planted various crops in the fields. This is done to ensure that the planted seeds grow without being eaten away by the guinea fowls. As you know, these birds are very notorious with seed, especially maize. Once the seedlings are of good health, and can not be destroyed anymore by the guinea fowls, we then put them on semi-free range. Mphaka	These guinea fowls belong to the community. How does the community assist you in taking care of the guinea fowls in terms of feeding them and other things? Ngondo	The community assists in several ways. They take turns in making sure that the inside and outside of the guinea fowl house is clean. They are also the ones who do the actual feeding of the guinea fowls. Mphaka	Would you like to tell me the difference in terms of production of eggs between the times when you are giving them food inside their house, and when you are allowing them to go out free range? Ngondo	They lay eggs more continuously when they are on semi-free range. We think this is because they are able to supplement on the food we give them inside the stall. Again, we think that the space and fresh air which they enjoy outside, give them more freedom which make them healthier. Mphaka	What would you say is the advantage of rearing guinea fowls over chickens? Ngondo	Guinea fowls are better than chickens when it comes to diseases.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the morphology of the oropharynx and tongue <b>of</b> the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> using gross anatomical and histological techniques. The {{results showed that the}} mouth and pharynx <b>of</b> the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> lacked a definite line of demarcation, and so formed a common oropharyngeal cavity. The roof of the oropharynx was formed by the hard palate and the choana. The hard palate was characterized by a broad v-shaped rostral mucosal swelling, a median palatine ridge that bifurcated caudally into left and right lateral palatine ridges, and para-median rows of caudally pointed conical papillae. The tongue <b>of</b> the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> was located {{on the floor of the}} oropharynx, but did not extend to the full limits of the lower beak. The caudal and rostral parts of the tongue were demarcated by a v-shaped row of papillae, the papillary crest. Histologically, the dorsal surface of the tongue was lined by a non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that contained intraepithelial taste buds, while the lining on the ventral surface of the tongue was a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. Other features include a wide sub-epithelial connective tissue layer containing lingual glands, and a core of striated muscles. Th...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the mineral intake, utilization and retention <b>of</b> <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> fed varying levels of mopane worm meal as a protein source under intensive system up to 13 weeks of age. Ninety-six day old keets {{were randomly assigned to}} four dietary treatments each having four replicates (n = 6 /replicate). The four treatments were 3 % fishmeal (control), 4. 5 % mopane worm meal, 9 % mopane worm meal and 13. 5 % mopane worm meal. At 7 and 13 weeks of age, blood and faecal samples were collected from three randomly selected birds from each replicate and analyzed for minerals. At 13 weeks of age, all birds were sacrificed and left tibiae collected for determination of bone physical dimensions and mineral composition. Meat samples were collected from the thighs and decomposed by microwave digestion and analyzed for various minerals. Data were regarded as a split plot design with four dietary treatments and analyzed using the General Linear Model Procedures in Statistical Analysis System. Dietary treatment had no significant (P> 0. 05) effect on bone length. Bone weights for birds fed 9 % mopane worm meal and bone widths for birds fed 4. 5 % mopane worm meal had lower weights (5. 96 g) and widths (5. 79 mm) than the other three treatments which did not differ significantly from each other. Bone mineral composition <b>of</b> <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> fed diets with 4. 5 % mopane meal had significantly higher P (353. 62 mg/l), Na (1332. 96 mg/l) and K (1841 mg/l) contents than other treatment diets where the control and 13. 5 % mopane worm meal diets did not differ significantly. Generally, meat and blood mineral compositions <b>of</b> <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> fed 4. 5 % mopane worm meal were higher than those fed on 13. 5 % mopane worm meal diet whilst control and 9 % mopane worm meal were the same.
