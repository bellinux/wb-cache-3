5|$|Abrahams Creek {{is named}} after a {{historic}} Mohican chief <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>village</b> in the area. The creek's watershed was historically heavily logged and farmed and a sediment retention structure {{was built in the}} watershed in the 1970s. Numerous bridges have been built over the creek since 1925. The Abrahams Creek Watershed Association operates in the watershed. A 500-million-gallon reservoir known as Frances Slocum Lake was built on the creek in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Across Madagascar, the cyclone killed 34people {{and injured}} 13others. High winds {{destroyed}} 25,464houses, which left 25,845people homeless. Bingiza first affected the Masoala National Park, destroying half <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>village</b> and leaving it isolated. High winds and heavy rainfall left over 500km2km (195mi2) of damaged crops, which increased food prices and threatened the economic livelihoods {{of the affected}} people.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-2000s, {{the route}} was reconfigured in the {{northern}} part of Medina to use Main and Commercial streets instead of Center Street and Prospect Avenue. The change was made as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>village</b> project known as the Pass Thru Project, and the realignment eliminated a three-block overlap with the easternmost part of NY31E on Center Street. Ownership and maintenance of NY63's former alignment was transferred from the state to the village on July1, 2010, as part of a highway maintenance swap that gave Commercial Street and the northernmost block of Main Street to the state.|$|E

Ponnar and Shankar are valorous and compassionate to the sufferings of the poor. One day, the twins save two sisters, Muthayi (Pooja Chopra) and Pavalayi (Dhivya Parameshwaran), from death. The girls are later revealed to be daughters of Chinna Malaikozhundhu. Impressed with Ponnar and Shankar's valour, Chinna Malaikozhundhu agrees to marry off his daughters to them.|$|E
5|$|Rodmarton Manor is {{a country}} house built between 1909 and 1929, built from local materials, worked by local craftsmen. It was built as three wings, viewed in plan as three sides of an octagon, around a large {{circular}} courtyard, covered in grass {{which is designed to}} be reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>village</b> green. The majority of the building is two storeys high and made of coursed cut stone, the plinth is offset and the quoins are flush. The roof is made of stone slate, with grouped chimneystacks.|$|E

5|$|Abu Bakar {{employed}} {{the service of}} a Chinese contractor and long-time acquaintance, Wong Ah Fook, to oversee the development of Johor Bahru. The Johor Archives showed that Wong was the largest building contractor at that time and had been involved in at least twenty public works projects between 1887 and 1895. In addition, Wong was contracted to oversee the construction of the state mosque and several palaces under the direction of Abu Bakar. As a gratitude to Wong's contributions to the state, Abu Bakar granted him a plot of land in the heart of Johor Bahru in 1892. Wong then oversaw the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>village,</b> Kampong Ah Fook, as well as a road, Jalan Wong Ah Fook on the land that he was granted.|$|E
5|$|After {{the audio}} launch, the {{positive}} {{reception of the}} song Chinni Chinni Aasalu prompted the makers to release a video featuring {{the making of the}} song.

On the other hand, the video showcased the recording of the song by Shreya Ghoshal. The video too received positive response. A still featuring Chaitanya and Samantha in an intimate sequence from the flashback was re-tweeted many times by the fans and Telugu film websites. A short teaser, 31 seconds long, was unveiled on 13 May 2014, in which Samantha was seen speaking about Nageshwar continuously at a doctors' check up and the montage of the film's male leads being played side by side.|$|E

5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{the construction of}} a castle led to the destruction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>village,</b> such as at Eaton Socon in England, it was more common for the villages nearby to have grown {{as a result of the}} presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle. The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confined to Europe. When the 13th-century Safad Castle was founded in Galilee in the Holy Land, the 260villages benefitted from the inhabitants' newfound ability to move freely. When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local landscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord. Settlements could also grow naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of proximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importance– perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration– the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement depopulated.|$|E
5|$|An eagle’s {{appearance}} in the sky when thunderclouds threatened was greeted with joy and hope by people who trusted {{in their power to}} defeat an ala; after defeating the ala, the eagle led the clouds away from the fields. An explanation for this, recorded in eastern Serbia, is that the eagles which nest in the vicinity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>village</b> want thunderstorms and hail as far as possible from their nestlings, so coincidentally protect the village’s fields as well. The role of eagles, however, was controversial, because in the same region there was a belief that an eagle flying in front of thunderstorm clouds was a manifestation of an ala, leading the clouds toward the crops, rather than driving them away.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} Korean rural folk traditions, {{the sport is}} {{regarded}} as a predictor of future events, specifically harvests. The outcome of a ritualised contest between the two sides <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>village</b> (East and West) was seen as an indicator of the abundance (or otherwise) of that year's rice crop, which would be harvested in the autumn; as a result, juldarigi and similar folk sports are predominant in the rice-growing areas of the South. This is due to the common association in Southeast Asia between dragons (which the ropes of the juldarigi are thought to resemble) and rain; as a result juldarigi or similar tug-of-war ceremonies have also historically been staged during periods of drought. The connection of the two ropes used (with one rope's smaller loop being placed through the other's larger loop) is reminiscent of sexual intercourse, which also gives rise to the sport's association with fecundity.|$|E

5|$|European {{exploration}} of the future site of Wagga Wagga began in 1829 {{with the arrival of}} Captain Charles Sturt during his expedition along the Murrumbidgee River. Settlers arrived shortly thereafter with Charles Tompson establishing the Eunonyhareenyha 'run' on the north bank of the river in 1832, and then in soon after George Best establishing the Wagga Wagga 'run' on the south bank. Other settlers followed, with all of them initially squatting on the land illegally but by 1836 the colonial government regulated the tenure of land and established a licensing scheme. Within a few years settlers numbers increased greatly and before 1850 a local bench of magistrates and a place for holding petty sessions was established. The beginnings <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>village</b> formed near the ford used by most traffic passing through the area and included a crude blacksmith's shop, a hotel, and a post office. By 1849 the town was marked out by surveyor Thomas Scott Townsend and formally gazetted as a village.|$|E
5|$|George {{returns to}} Paris and learns from Andre Lobineau, a {{colleague}} of Nicole's, that Montfauçon is a location in Paris. Flap and Guido attempt to steal the tripod from the museum; but they are beaten to the theft by Nicole, who gives the artifact to George. In the sewers of Montfauçon, George spies on a secret meeting of people who {{claim to be the}} Templars, and he learns of their plan to find the Sword of Baphomet. After the group leaves, George uses the tripod and gem in the underground chamber to reveal the name <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>village</b> in Syria: Marib. He travels to the village and discovers that Khan has been looking for him. At a nearby rock formation called the Bull's Head, George finds a lens and deduces that it is represented on the manuscript as a crystal ball. He also discovers an idol with three bearded faces, Baphomet; and a Latin inscription that describes Britain. Khan arrives and holds George at gunpoint, but George manages to escape.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, enthusiasts for Delius's music who {{had gone}} to Bradford for the centenary festival formed the Delius Society; Fenby became its first president. With around 400 members, the Society is {{independent}} from the Trust, but works closely with it. Its general objectives are the furtherance of knowledge of Delius's life and works, and the encouragement of performances and recordings. In 2004, as a stimulus for young musicians to study and perform Delius's music, the Society established an annual Delius Prize competition, with a prize of £1,000 to the winner. In June 1984, at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, the Delius Trust sponsored a commemorative production <b>of</b> <b>A</b> <b>Village</b> Romeo and Juliet by Opera North, to mark the 50th anniversary of Delius's death.|$|E

5|$|Mauna Loa {{continued}} its activity, {{and of the}} eruptions that occurred in 1887, 1892, 1896, 1899, 1903 (twice), 1907, 1914, 1916, 1919, and 1926, three (in 1887, 1919, and 1926) were partially subaerial. The 1926 eruption in particular is noteworthy for having inundated <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>village</b> near Hoopuloa, destroying 12 houses, a church, and a small harbor. After an event in 1933, Mauna Loa's 1935 eruption caused a public crisis when its flows started to head towards Hilo. A bombing operation was decided upon to try and divert the flows, planned out by then-lieutenant colonel George S. Patton. The bombing, conducted on December 27, was declared a success by Thomas A. Jaggar, director of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, and lava stopped flowing by January 2, 1936. However, the role the bombing played in ending the eruption has since been heavily disputed by volcanologists. A longer but summit-bound event in 1940 was comparatively less interesting.|$|E

5|$|The Comilla Model (1959) was Khan's {{initiative}} {{in response to}} the failure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Village</b> Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) programme that was launched in 1953 in East and West Pakistan with technical assistance from the US government. V-AID remained a government-level attempt to promote citizen participation in the sphere of rural development. Khan launched the project in 1959 on his return from Michigan, and developed a methodology of implementation in the areas of agricultural and rural development on the principle of grassroots-level participation. Initially, the aim was to provide a development model of programmes and institutions that could be replicated across the country. Advisory support in this respect was provided by experts from Harvard and Michigan State Universities, the Ford Foundation, and USAID. Practical help was also sought from Japan to improve the local farming techniques.|$|E
