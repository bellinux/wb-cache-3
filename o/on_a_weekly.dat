5|$|Enix remade Dragon Quest and Dragon QuestII for a one-cartridge {{compilation}} {{known as}} Dragon QuestI+II for the Super Famicom on December18, 1993. The remake sold over 1.2million copies in Japan. In 1998, Enix released BS Dragon Quest for the Super Famicom Satellaview extension exclusively in Japan. The latter consisted of four one-hour scenarios which players would download <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>weekly</b> schedule. Players were tasked with leveling their character, collecting medals and completing scenario-specific conditions with special events designed to occur under specific conditions in real-time.|$|E
5|$|Figures from WRAP {{revealed}} {{the most efficient}} method of collecting food waste to be separate collections, followed by mixed green and food waste <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>weekly</b> basis. A mixed fortnightly collection was shown {{to be the worst}} performing. This was considered confirmation of earlier suspicions that, if carried out correctly, separate collections can result in less wastage of biodegradable waste. A widespread pilot scheme for separate food waste collection, involving nineteen English local authorities, achieved success and 'high levels of satisfaction' from households.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of the}} year, the {{garrison}} would be plagued by mosquitoes and the heat and humidity common to the Washington area during the summer. Though Fort Greble was built on a hill, the area immediately surrounding the fort consisted of swampy bottomland drained by the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, {{a breeding ground for}} malaria. Communication with the outside world was provided by the military road that served the Eastern Branch line of forts, and supply wagons would usually arrive <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>weekly</b> schedule. Trips to Washington or Uniontown from the fort were uncommon, and by virtue of its location at the extreme end of the Eastern Branch defenses, Fort Greble was isolated even from its neighboring forts.|$|E
5|$|In early 1787, Thomas Clarkson, {{a fellow}} {{graduate}} of St John's, Cambridge, {{who had become}} convinced {{of the need to}} end the slave trade after writing a prize-winning essay on the subject while at Cambridge, called upon Wilberforce at Old Palace Yard with a published copy of the work.

5|$|The 1961 {{season was}} typical on the field: Jim Brown {{led the league}} in rushing for the fifth {{straight}} season and the team ended with an 8–5–1 record. That left Cleveland two games out of a berth in the championship. During that year, however, players began to question Paul Brown's strict and often overbearing demeanor, while many challenged his control over the team's strategy. Milt Plum spoke out against Brown calling all the team's offensive plays, and Jim Brown said <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>weekly</b> radio broadcast that the coach's play-calling and handling of Plum were undermining the quarterback's confidence. They found a willing listener in Modell, a bachelor who was closer to their age than the coach's.|$|E

It has served different ferry companies since the first steamship route to Copenhagen opened in 1830. Currently Mols-Linien operates the route and annually transports some 2 million passengers and a million vehicles. Additional roll-on/roll-off cargo ferries serve Finland and Kalundborg <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>weekly</b> basis and smaller outlying Danish ports at irregular intervals. Since the early 2000s the port has increasingly become a destination for cruise lines operating in the Baltic Sea.|$|E

During his career, Thorpe {{was one of the most}} prominent and popular sportspeople in Australia. Despite competing in a sport in which the vast majority of international athletes' earnings are below the poverty line, marketing surveys consistently ranked Thorpe as the most sought-after Australian athlete for sponsorship deals, surpassing footballers who compete <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>weekly</b> basis in much larger stadia. Aside from his swimsuit sponsor Adidas, Thorpe was sponsored by Australian corporate giants such as Qantas, Telstra, and the Seven Network.|$|E
5|$|At a {{congress}} in 1897 in Halle, the localists founded {{a national organization}} of their own, the Representatives' Centralization of Germany (Vertrauensmänner-Zentralisation Deutschlands). The congress was originally supposed to take place a year earlier, but {{a lack of interest}} forced it to be postponed. There were 37 delegates at the congress representing 6,803 union members. Nearly two-thirds of the delegates came from Berlin or Halle. Almost half the delegates worked in the construction industry, while 14 delegates came from highly specialized professions. The congress decided to establish a five-person Business Commission seated in Berlin to organize political actions, aid in communication between local organizations, and raise financial support for strikes. Fritz Kater became the chairman of the commission. A newspaper, Solidarität (Solidarity), was founded, but the name was changed to Die Einigkeit (Unity) the following year. It initially appeared fortnightly, but was published <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>weekly</b> basis beginning in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{developed}} to be Naruto's opposite, Kishimoto remarked that Sasuke was the most memorable character for him to design. Kishimoto has remarked that Sasuke's character was also influenced by Hiei from Yoshihiro Togashi's series YuYu Hakusho, stating that he referenced Hiei when designing the character character and his Sharingan ability. He also considered Sasuke his most challenging character to create, because his design gave Kishimoto a number of problems. He lacked a proper idea of what Sasuke's face should look like, and his initial drafts of Sasuke appeared too old or mature for a character {{the same age as}} Naruto. Original designs of Sasuke had a number of necklaces and ties around his arms and legs a result of Kishimoto's habit of giving characters as much ornamentation as possible. Realizing he could not draw such a complex character <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>weekly</b> basis, Kishimoto simplified the design to be a basic contrast of Naruto's costume.|$|E

5|$|Between 1962 and 1992 {{there was}} a {{hardened}} nuclear bunker, built for No 16 Group Royal Observer Corps Shrewsbury, who provided the field force of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation and would have sounded the four-minute warning alarm {{in the event of}} war and warned the population of Shrewsbury in the event of approaching radioactive fallout. The building was manned by up to 120 volunteers who trained <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>weekly</b> basis and wore a Royal Air Force style uniform. After the breakup of the communist bloc in 1989, the Royal Observer Corps was disbanded between September 1991 and December 1995. However, the nuclear bunker still stands just inside Holywell Street near the Abbey as a lasting reminder of the Cold War, but is now converted and used as a veterinary practice.|$|E
5|$|Gaara's initial attire, {{along with}} the costumes of his siblings, was {{difficult}} for Kishimoto to draw <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>weekly</b> basis. Because of this, Kishimoto gave {{the three of them}} simpler costumes towards the end of Part I; Gaara received an outfit with an upright collar. In addition to being easier to draw, it was used to demonstrate the change in relationship between Gaara and Naruto following their previous fight. Kishimoto cites The Matrix, one of his favorite movies, as an inspiration for Gaara's new costume, and he considers it to be his favorite costume of the three siblings. For Part II, there was a scene where an antagonist Deidara was sitting on Gaara's body. This shot was inspired by Akira, a manga by Katsuhiro Otomo that Kishimoto was a fan of.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, Activision {{announced}} a new entry in the series, titled Guitar Hero Live. The title was developed by Activision's internal studio FreeStyleGames, who previously had worked on the DJ Hero spinoff titles. FreeStyleGames were given free rein to reboot the Guitar Hero series for next-generation consoles. One of their first innovations was to drop the standard five-button guitar controller, ultimately designing a six-button guitar controller, with two rows of three buttons each, allowing them to mimic actual guitar fingering. Guitar Hero Live was released with both a career and an online mode. The career mode used full-motion video taken {{from the perspective of}} a lead guitarist underneath the note highway, to create an immersive experience to the player. The online mode, called GHTV, discarded the previous downloadable content approach and used a music video channel approach to stream playable songs to players, adding new songs to the catalog <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>weekly</b> basis. The game was released in October 2015.|$|E
