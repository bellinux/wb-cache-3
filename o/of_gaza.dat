5|$|Following its demolition, it is {{not known}} how long Darum {{remained}} deserted, but it was eventually resettled during Mamluk rule which began in 1250. For much of the Mamluk era, the town came under the administration of the politically important Niyabah <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> (Province <b>of</b> <b>Gaza),</b> part of the larger Mamlaka of Damascus (Kingdom of Damascus.) Along with Karatiyya and Beit Jibrin, Darum was an amal (district) of the Province <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> with its own wali (governor).|$|E
5|$|Murray made steady {{progress}} against the Turkish forces, which were {{defeated in the}} battles of Romani, Magdhaba and Rafa. However, he was repulsed at {{the first and second}} battle <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> in 1917. The defeat in the Second Battle <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> prompted the War Office to change the command of the EEF, and on 28 June 1917, Murray was replaced by General Sir Edmund Allenby, who reinvigorated the campaign.|$|E
5|$|The EEF {{had already}} decided to invade Ottoman {{territory}} before the first battle <b>of</b> <b>Gaza,</b> {{on the basis of}} Britain's three major war objectives: to maintain maritime supremacy in the Mediterranean, preserve {{the balance of power in}} Europe, and protect Egypt, India and the Persian Gulf. Despite the EEF's defeats during the first two battles <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> (with about 10,000 casualties), Allenby planned an advance into Palestine and the capture of Jerusalem to secure the region and cut off the Ottoman forces in Mesopotamia from those in the Levant and on the Arabian Peninsula. The capture <b>of</b> <b>Gaza,</b> which dominated the coastal route from Egypt to Jaffa, was a first step towards these aims.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} of the village on Via Maris enhanced the city's importance during the Ottoman rule. In 1596 CE, administrated by nahiya ("subdistrict") <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> under the liwa' ("district") <b>of</b> <b>Gaza,</b> the population of Ashdod numbered about 413. The villagers paid taxes on wheat, barley, sesame and fruit crops, as well as goats and beehives.|$|E
5|$|According to {{geographer}} Abu al-Fida, Gaza was {{a medium-sized}} city, possessing gardens and a seashore {{in the early}} 13th century. The Ayyubids constructed the Shuja'iyya neighborhood—the first extension <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> beyond the Old City.|$|E
5|$|An early {{governor}} <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> Sanjak was Kara Shahin Mustafa, {{a former}} jannissary (member {{of a military}} corps) who rose to become an elite military officer and state minister and eventually a vizier and trusted aide of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. He received the governorship <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> apparently as an interim appointment before he was appointed Governor of Egypt, although he was deposed three years later by Sultan Selim II. Mustafa died {{a short while later}} and his son Ridwan Pasha, who was the treasurer of Yemen, became governor shortly before Mustafa's death. The Ridwan dynasty, which would rule Gaza for over a century, derives its name from Ridwan Pasha. He was later appointed Governor of Yemen, but was deposed two years later and returned to the governorship <b>of</b> <b>Gaza.</b> After becoming governor of Ethiopia, Basra, and Diyarbakir in that order, he successfully led an Ottoman contingent against Safavid Persia in 1579. The sultan then awarded him the province of Anatolia where he died in 1585.|$|E
5000|$|Al-Zaytun (also spelled Zeitoun or Harat az-Zaytoun, Arabic translation: [...] "the Quarter of Olive trees") is {{the southwestern}} and largest quarter <b>of</b> <b>Gaza's</b> Old City. Prior to the {{demolition}} of the Old City's walls, {{it was one of}} the three walled quarters <b>of</b> <b>Gaza's</b> Old City, the other two being al-Tuffah in the northeast and al-Daraj in the northwest. Omar Mukhtar Street, Gaza City's main thoroughfare, separates al-Zaytun from al-Daraj.|$|R
5000|$|The International Committee of the Red Cross {{also notes}} that [...] "90% <b>of</b> <b>Gaza's</b> 4000 {{fishermen}} are now considered either poor (with a monthly income of between 100 and 190 US dollars) or very poor (earning less than 100 dollars a month), up from 50% in 2008." [...] Nezar Ayyash, head <b>of</b> <b>Gaza's</b> fishermen's union, {{is quoted as saying}} that he has been arrested and his boat confiscated several times.|$|R
5000|$|Israel has {{combined}} the Israeli and Egyptian blockade <b>of</b> <b>Gaza's</b> land borders with a maritime blockade <b>of</b> <b>Gaza's</b> port and coastline by the Israeli Navy. Israeli patrol boats regularly cruise off Gaza’s coastline and routinely fire on Palestinian fishing vessels that go more than 6 nautical miles from shore. Israel has intercepted {{a number of}} vessels providing aid for Gaza, claiming {{that they may be}} providing goods that may be used to build arms. Cynthia McKinney and Mairead Maguire were captured by Israel attempting to sail to Gaza and deported. The supplies McKinney and Maguire were carrying on board were later delivered to Gaza over land by truck.|$|R
5|$|During a Khamsin on 3 November {{while the}} {{bombardment}} <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> resumed, the 1/4th Battalion The Essex Regiment (161st Brigade, 54th Division, XXI Corps) attacked and captured Yunis trench at 04:30. However, they were heavily counterattacked {{and forced to}} withdraw. The following night, several strong Ottoman counterattacks were made on the 75th Division's position at Sheikh Abbas {{on the eastern side}} <b>of</b> <b>Gaza,</b> which were all stopped by machine gun and rifle fire. Meanwhile, the newly won position at Sheikh Hasan on the Ottoman right flank was consolidated.|$|E
5|$|Emir Sanjar al-Jawli {{acquired}} the governorship <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> and central Palestine in 1311. He highly favored Gaza and transformed {{it into a}} flourishing city, having built in it a horse-race course, a madrasa (college), a mosque, a khan (caravansary), a maristan (hospital), and a castle. In late 1332, coinciding with the appointment of Emir Taynal al-Ashrafi as governor, some of the provincial privileges <b>of</b> <b>Gaza,</b> such as the governor's direct subordination to the sultan in Cairo, were removed by an-Nasir Muhammad's decree. From then, and until 1341 when Sanjar al-Jawli served a second term as governor, Gaza became subordinate to the na'ib as-saltana (viceroy) of Syria, Emir Tankiz al-Husami.|$|E
5|$|In early 1917, the Imperial Mounted Division {{was formed}} from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and two British mounted brigades. The {{division}} first saw service during the First Battle <b>of</b> <b>Gaza,</b> which occurred in southern Gaza on 26 March 1917. At around noon two mounted brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division attacked Gaza {{from the north}} and east. At 6.00 pm the Turkish position had become perilous with the ring closing tightly around Gaza. However, in a decision that dismayed most of their soldiers the British commanders decided to call off the attack and retreat, delivering victory to the Turks. A second attempt was made to capture Gaza on 19 April by which time the Turkish defences were even more formidable and the task confronting the British even more difficult. This battle became known as the Second Battle <b>of</b> <b>Gaza.</b> The Anzac Mounted Division played only a minor role in this battle suffering only 105 casualties out of the 5,917 suffered. The second battle <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> was a disastrous defeat for the Allied forces.|$|E
2500|$|Israel {{asserts that}} since the {{disengagement}} <b>of</b> Israel from <b>Gaza</b> in 2005, Israel no longer occupies the Gaza Strip. However, as it retained certain control <b>of</b> <b>Gaza's</b> airspace and coastline, [...] it continued to be designated as an occupying power in the Gaza Strip by the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly and some countries and various human rights organizations.|$|R

5|$|The Bubonic Plague {{struck again}} in 1839 {{and the city}} stagnated, as it lacked {{political}} and economic stability. In 1840, Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside <b>of</b> <b>Gaza,</b> with the Ottomans emerging victorious, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. The battles brought about more death and destruction, just barely after the city began {{to recover from the}} plague. The Church of Saint Porphyrius was renovated in 1856, and in 1874, French orientalist Charles Clermont-Ganneau visited Gaza, gathering and cataloging a sizable collection of Byzantine inscriptions and describing the city's Great Mosque in detail. Sultan Abdul Hamid II had the wells <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> restored in 1893.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders wrested control <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> {{from the}} Fatimids in 1100. According to the chronicler William of Tyre, the Crusaders found it {{uninhabited}} and in ruins. Unable to totally refortify the hilltop on which Gaza was built, {{due to a}} lack of resources, King Baldwin III built a small castle there in 1149. The possession <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> completed the military encirclement of the Fatimid-held city of Ascalon to the north. After the castle's construction, Baldwin granted it and the surrounding region to the Knights Templar. He also had the Great Mosque converted into the Cathedral of Saint John.|$|E
5|$|The Rasheed Coastal Road {{runs along}} Gaza's {{coastline}} and connects {{it with the}} rest <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> Strip's coastline north and south.

50|$|After Hamas won the 2006 {{legislative}} election, Israel and Egypt tightened their closure <b>of</b> <b>Gaza's</b> borders. Israel {{says the}} purpose of the restrictions in import <b>of</b> goods into <b>Gaza</b> are to pressure Hamas, which does not recognise Israel and backs attacks on its citizens. Construction materials including metal pipes, steel and cement are banned, since Israel fears could be used for building rockets and constructing underground bunkers and tunnels.|$|R
50|$|Ever {{since the}} Disengagement, Israeli COGAT {{activity}} {{with regards to}} the Gaza Strip is carried out by the Coordination and Liaison Administration <b>of</b> the <b>Gaza</b> Strip (headed by a Colonel).

5|$|The family {{restored}} the minarets of two mosques in the Shuja'iyya quarter <b>of</b> <b>Gaza,</b> while Musa Pasha had the minaret of the Great Mosque <b>of</b> <b>Gaza</b> rebuilt. A mosque was also constructed {{within the confines}} of the Qasr al-Basha fortress, which later came to be known as the Ridwan Castle in light of its function as the Ridwans' residence (ad-Dabawiyya). The fortress itself was outfitted with additional defenses, including arrow slits and narrow openings, which were extended to employ the use of cannon. During Ridwan rule, the Qaysariyyah Market in Gaza's al-Daraj quarter was reconstructed as was the Hamam al-Sammara bathhouse and the former Khan az-Zayt caravansary. Bahram Pasha ordered the construction of the main sabil ("fountain") in Gaza in the mid-16th-century.|$|E

Like other regions and cities in Palestine at the time, Gaza was economically and politically dominated {{by a number of}} powerful clans, particularly the Shawa, Husseini, and Sourani families. Two destructive earthquakes occurred in 1903 and 1914.|$|E

There are a number of hotels in Gaza, including the Palestine, Grand Palace, Adam, al-Amal, al-Quds, Cliff, al-Deira and Marna House. All, except the Palestine Hotel, are located along in the coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street. Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists, and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists, aid workers, UN and Red Cross personnel.
