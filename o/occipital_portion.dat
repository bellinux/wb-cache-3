50|$|In {{the first}} {{description}} of Trilophosuchus, Paul Willis tentatively considered the genus to be terrestrial, because most other extinct crocodyliforms with short snouts and laterally directed eyes were terrestrial. The arrangements {{of the neck}} muscles of Trilophosuchus, evidenced by {{the shape of the}} <b>occipital</b> <b>portion</b> of the skull, suggests that it held its head high, a posture more suitable for a terrestrial rather than semiaquatic lifestyle. Compared to living animals, Trilophosuchus probably had a posture more like monitor lizards than crocodiles. The short length of its snout, contrasting with the longer snouts of larger carnivorous crocodylians such as Pristichampsus, suggests that Trilophosaurus restricted its diet to smaller prey. It may have consumed fish, turtles, snakes, and small mammals, all of which have been found from Riversleigh. The neck musculature of Trilophosuchus may have enabled it to make rapid movements of the head when feeding, up and down, side to side, and rotationally.|$|E

40|$|In this {{functional}} MRI {{study the}} frequency-dependent localization of acoustically evoked BOLD responses within the human auditory cortex was investigated. A blocked design was employed, consisting of periods of tonal stimulation (random frequency modulations with center frequencies 0. 25, 0. 5, 4. 0, and 8. 0 kHz) and resting periods during which only the ambient scanner noise was audible. Multiple frequency-dependent activation sites were reliably demonstrated {{on the surface}} of the auditory cortex. The individual gyral pattern of the superior temporal plane (STP), especially the anatomy of Heschl’s gyrus (HG), was found to be the major source of interindividual variability. Considering this variability by tracking the frequency responsiveness to the four stimulus frequencies along individual Heschl’s gyri yielded medio-lateral gradients of responsiveness to high frequencies medially and low frequencies laterally. It is, however, argued that with regard to the results of electrophysiological and cytoarchitectonical studies in humans and in nonhuman primates, the multiple frequency-dependent activation sites found in the present study as well as in other recent fMRI investigations are no direct indication of tonotopic organization of cytoarchitectonical areas. An alternative interpretation is that the activation sites correspond to different cortical fields, the topological organization of which cannot be resolved with the current spatial resolution of fMRI. In this notion, the detected frequency selectivity of different cortical areas arises from an excess of neurons engaged in the processing of different acoustic features, which are associated with different frequency bands. Differences in the response properties of medial compared to lateral and frontal compared to <b>occipital</b> <b>portions</b> of HG strongly support this notion. © 2002 Elsevie...|$|R

The large image enhancements we observe (often > 30 %) are consistent with literature results extrapolated to 9. 4 T. However, there are also two unusual aspects to our findings. (i) The visual area of the brain responds only to changes in stimulus intensity, suggesting that we directly detect operations of the M visual system pathway.

40|$|The {{ontogeny}} of {{the posterior}} otic and anterior <b>occipital</b> <b>portions</b> of the neural endocranium of prehatching Alligator mississippiensis was investigated by reconstruction from sectioned material. In Stage 6 of this species, {{in which the}} endochondral ossification of the otoccipital region of the neural endocranium is only in its very early stage, two bony outgrowths—laminae—are present at the external wall of the posterior portion of the neural endocranium. The anterior lamina arises from the external surface of the basal plate {{at the level of}} the posterior margin of the subcapsular process; the posterior lamina arises from the external surface of that portion of the pila occipitalis that forms the posteroventral wall of the metotic fissure. During ontogeny, both laminae lying in the anteroposterior sequence ossify in membrane, fuse together, grow laterodorsally, and fuse with the lateral wall of the lateral semicircular canal and the crista parotica. This lamina forms a new, secondary wall enclosing the posterior section of the otic capsule and contains the large external jugular foramen (or foramen vagi) in its basal portion. The laminae, designated lamina juxtaotica anterior and posterior (lamina juxtaotica when fused together), have not been recorded previously in crocodylians and are absent in all other Recent reptiles. From the functional point of view, the juxtaotic lamina 1) forms the margins of the external jugular foramen, and 2) forms the floor of the posterior section of the Eustachian tube. In birds, the structure called the metotic cartilage, which arises in ontogeny as an independent element, has a similar position as the juxtaotic lamina. However, the two structures differ in their developmental origins and their relation to the Eustachian tube and the ramus hyomandibularis of the facialis nerve. Moreover, there is no external jugular foramen in birds...|$|R

40|$|Several fMRI {{studies have}} {{examined}} brain regions mediating inter-subject variability in cognitive efficiency, but none have examined regions mediating intra-subject variability in efficiency. Thus, {{the present study was}} designed to identify brain regions involved in intra-subject variability in cognitive efficiency via participant-level correlations between trial-level reaction time (RT) and trial-level fMRI BOLD percent signal change on a processing speed task. On each trial, participants indicated whether a digit-symbol probe-pair was present or absent in an array of nine digit-symbol probe-pairs while fMRI data were collected. Deconvolution analyses, using RT time-series models (derived from the proportional scaling of an event-related hemodynamic response function model by trial-level RT), were used to evaluate relationships between trial-level RTs and BOLD percent signal change. Although task-related patterns of activation and deactivation were observed in regions including bilateral <b>occipital,</b> bilateral parietal, <b>portions</b> of the medial wall such as the precuneus, default mode network regions including anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, bilateral temporal, right cerebellum, and right cuneus, RT-BOLD correlations were observed in a more circumscribed set of regions. Positive RT-related patterns, or RT-BOLD correlations where fast RTs were associated with lower BOLD percent signal change, were observed in regions including bilateral occipital, bilateral parietal, and the precuneus. RT-BOLD correlations were not observed in the default mode network indicating a smaller set of regions associated with intra-subject variability in cognitive efficiency. The results are discussed in terms of a distributed area of regions that mediate variability in the cognitive efficiency that might underlie processing speed differences between individuals...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the associations between (1) handedness (demonstrated preference of one hand {{for the performance of}} most unimanual tasks) and neuroanatomical asymmetry (measurable differences in width between the cerebral hemispheres) and (2) familial history of handedness (the presence of a left-handed sibling or parent of a right-handed subject) as an intervening factor in the relation between handedness and neuroanatomical asymmetry. Width measurements of the brain were derived from computerized tomographic (CT) films and grouped in to categories by hand preference (measured by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory) and family history. The measurements of right (n= 68), right with left-· handed relatives (n= 24), and left-handed (n= 16) groups were then compared by width and other transformations of the brain measurements. Subjects were adults of both sexes who had been referred for neurologic examination and were diagnosed as free of major distorting brain pathology. Hemispheric widths were compared by group, as ratios (left÷right) and as differences (left-right). Analysis of variance revealed significant differences between right-hemisphere widths at three percentages of brain length in the posterior <b>occipital</b> and temporal-parietal <b>portion</b> of the right hemisphere. The two right-handed groups had significantly smaller right-hemisphere measurements than the left group at 80 % (p=. 03), 75 % (p=. 012), and 60 % (p=. 029) of brain length. There were no significant left-hemisphere differences between the groups. In terms of ratios of sides and differences between sides in the same brain region, the left - handed group was different from the right-handed group at the p Handedness appears to be moderately associated with neuroanatomical asymmetry. The differences in sizes of brain structures and their relation to functionally lateralized abilities may shed light on the processes by which each hemisphere becomes specialized to perform specific tasks and other aspects of individual differences...|$|R
40|$|The first {{systematic}} {{account of}} the neural crest in the human has been prepared after an investigation of 185 serially sectioned staged embryos, aided by graphic reconstructions. As many as fourteen named topographical subdivisions of the crest were identified and eight of them give origin to ganglia (Table 2). Significant findings in the human include the following. (1) An indication of mesencephalic neural crest is discernible already at stage 9, and trigeminal, facial, and postotic components can be detected at stage 10. (2) Crest was not observed {{at the level of}} diencephalon 2. Although pre-otic crest from the neural folds is at first continuous (stage 10), crest-free zones are soon observable (stage 11) in Rh. 1, 3, and 5. (3) Emigration of cranial neural crest from the neural folds at the neurosomatic junction begins before closure of the rostral neuropore, and later crest cells do not accumulate above the neural tube. (4) The trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal and vagal ganglia, which develop from crest that emigrates before the neural folds have fused, continue to receive contributions from the roof plate of the neural tube after fusion of the folds. (5) The nasal crest and the terminalis-vomeronasal complex are the last components of the cranial crest to appear (at stage 13) and they persist longer. (6) The optic, mesencephalic, isthmic, accessory, and hypoglossal crest do not form ganglia. Cervical ganglion 1 is separated early from the neural crest and is not a Froriep ganglion. (7) The cranial ganglia derived from neural crest show a specific relationship to individual neuromeres, and rhombomeres are better landmarks than the otic primordium, which descends during stages 9 – 14. (8) Epipharyngeal placodes of the pharyngeal arches contribute to cranial ganglia, although that of arch 1 is not typical. (9) The neural crest from rhombomeres 6 and 7 that migrates to pharyngeal arch 3 and from there rostrad to the truncus arteriosus at stage 12 is identified here, {{for the first time in}} the human, as the cardiac crest. (10) The hypoglossal crest provides cells that accompany those of myotomes 1 – 4 and form the hypoglossal cell cord at stages 13 and 14. (11) The occipital crest, which is related to somites 1 – 4 in the human, differs from the spinal mainly in that it does not develop ganglia. (12) The <b>occipital</b> and spinal <b>portions</b> of the crest migrate dorsoventrad and appear to traverse the sclerotomes before the differentiation into loose and dense zones in the latter. (13) Embryonic examples of synophthalmia and anencephaly are cited to emphasize the role of the neural crest in the development of cranial ganglia and the skull...|$|R
40|$|Discovered in 1993 [1], the {{so-called}} ”uomo di Altamura” {{is a rare}} example of a rather complete non-modern human skeleton {{and one of the}} most amazing paleoanthropological specimen ever found in Europe. It represents a massive adult male Neanderthal with some peculiarities in its morphology and a very ancient age, ranging between 128 and 187 ka [2]. The preservation of the skeleton is exceptional, although largely incorporated within calcite concretions. In the last years, we started a thorough monitoring program, paired with a laser scanner acquisition and high-resolution photogrammetry of the cave, as well as of the skeletal elements emerging from the karst. Here we present the digital reconstruction of the cranium of the Altamura skeleton partially covered by concretions, virtually extracted from the whole matrix of our digital data. The superficial morphology of the cranium was digitally acquired in two steps, using different methodologies, given that the anterior components of the cranium are directly visible together with other bones of the skeleton, whereas many posterior and basal components are accessible only by techniques inspired to endoscopic surgery. The anterior components – most of the facial bones, the almost entire frontal bone, part of the right temporal and parietal bones, the labial and occlusal surface of the anterior dentition – were acquired with a high-resolution laser scanner (40 μm). By contrast, the posterior components – the <b>occipital</b> bone, large <b>portions</b> of the right parietal and of both temporal bones, the lower portions of the facial bones, and other elements of the cranial base – were acquired by technique of photogrammetry using HD microcameras. The images were processed using the software Agisoft Photoscan. The two large digital surfaces (halves) have in common the incisal edge of the anterior dentition; this allowed us to combine the two halves and adjust the mid-sagittal profile of the braincase appropriately. By means of Geometric Morphometrics, we have used 38 comparative Midto- Late Pleistocene Homo specimens (including Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis) and modern humans. The two halves of the Altamura cranium were aligned on a scaled and symmetrized version of a reference model. Using a landmark-based approach (performed separately for the anterior and posterior components), the best-fitting Neanderthal specimen for this purpose resulted to be Saccopastore 1. We have then warped the morphology of the reference specimen with dedicated software to fulfil the missing portions of the aligned two halves of Altamura. This was done in combination with mirrored part of Altamura itself; particularly, the left zygomatic process of the temporal bone, part of the right zygomatic bone and part of the lateral wall of the right parietal bone were digitally mirrored and repositioned on the corresponding missing portions on the opposite side. The complete and detailed protocol is described by Profico et al [3]. The digital reconstruction of the Altamura cranium is now suitable for morphological observations and some morphometric analyses. Among the visible features there are many traits that detach this specimen from the Neanderthal morphology. For instance, the facial districts display an advanced degree of midfacial prognathism with inflated maxillary sinuses, but the vault appears more plesiomorphic than the face: particularly the parietals are angulated in coronal section, while the mastoids are big and projecting downward. At the same time, while the occipital appears definitely Neanderthal-like in many respects – including a double-arched occipital torus and a well defined suprainiac fossa – the brow-ridges do not seem typical for a Neanderthal, since each supraorbital region (despite largely obscured by concretions) appears massive, with a marked distinction between medial and lateral aspects...|$|R
