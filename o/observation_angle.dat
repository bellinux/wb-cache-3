Figures 1 and 2 show the <b>observation</b> <b>angle</b> and entrance angle between the automobile's headlights, bicycle, and driver. The <b>observation</b> <b>angle</b> is the angle formed by the light beam and the driver's line of sight. <b>Observation</b> <b>angle</b> is {{a function of the}} distance between the headlights and the driver's eye, and the distance to the reflector. Traffic engineers use an <b>observation</b> <b>angle</b> of 0.2 degrees to simulate a reflector target about 800 feet in front of a passenger automobile. As the <b>observation</b> <b>angle</b> increases, the reflector performance decreases. For example, a truck has a large separation between the headlight and the driver's eye compared to a passenger vehicle. A bicycle reflector appears brighter to the passenger car driver than to the truck driver at the same distance from the vehicle to the reflector.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSea surface {{infrared}} reflectivity is {{an important}} parameter in oceanic remote sensing. Most analytical models consider single surface reflections, and the polarization is usually ignored. However, a loss of energy is reported for large <b>observation</b> <b>angles</b> (θ > 50 °) because multiple surface reflections are ignored. This article generalizes the infrared reflectivity derivation of Li et al. (Appl. Opt., Vol. 52, 6100 - 6111, 2013) for 1 D surfaces (2 D problems) to 2 D surfaces (3 D problems), so that the cross-polarization effect can be taken into account. The contributions of one and two successive surface reflections are analyzed separately. The bidirectional reflectivity and the hemispherical reflectivity are studied. It is shown that the sea surface infrared reflectivity is significant for large incidence and <b>observation</b> <b>angles.</b> The energy conservation criterion is then checked.

Increasing the swath with side view of the interferometer can be possible by increasing the flight altitude and angle of sight.

The efficiency of sector scan using in interferometric synthetic aperture radar is analyzed in this paper. The mathematical model and geometry of height measurement at a sector scan have been discussed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Signage {{systems are}} widely used in {{buildings}} to provide information for wayfinding, thereby assisting in navigation during normal circulation of pedestrians and, more importantly, exiting information during emergencies. An important consideration in determining the effectiveness of signs is establishing the region from which the sign is visible to occupants, the so-called visibility catchment area (VCA).

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{alternating}} fluidic core chevrons {{on the production}} of jet noise is investigated. Core nozzles for a representative 1 / 9 th scale, bypass ratio 5 model system were manufactured with slots cut near the trailing edges to allow for air injection into the core and fan streams. The injectors followed an alternating pattern around the nozzle perimeter so that the injection alternated between injection into the core stream and injection into the fan stream. For the takeoff condition and a forward flight Mach number of 0. 10, the overall sound pressure levels at the peak jet noise angle decrease with increasing injection pressure. Sound pressure levels increase for <b>observation</b> <b>angles</b> less than 110 o at higher injection pressures due to increases in high frequency noise. Greater increases in high frequency noise are observed {{when the number of}} injectors increases from 8 to 12. When the forward flight Mach number is increased to 0. 28, jet noise reduction (relative to the baseline) is observed at aft angles for increasing injection pressure while significant increases in jet noise are observed at forward <b>observation</b> <b>angles</b> due to substantial acoustic radiation at high frequencies. A comparison between inflow and alternating injectors shows that, for equal mass injection rates, the inflow nozzle produces greater low frequency noise reduction (relative to the baseline) than the alternating injectors at 90 o and aft <b>observation</b> <b>angles</b> and a forward flight Mach number of 0. 28. Preliminary computational fluid dynamic simulations indicate that the spatial decay rate of the hot potential core flow is less for the inflow nozzle than for the alternating nozzles which indicates that gentle mixing may be preferred over sever mixing when fluidic chevrons are used for jet noise reduction...|$|R

We analyze the effects due to changes in <b>observation</b> <b>angle,</b> including {{the rotation of the}} polarization plane. A mountainous area in the Alps (Northern Italy) is considered and the information on the relief extracted from a digital elevation model is exploited. The numerical simulation refers to a radiometric image, acquired by a conically-scanning radiometer similar to AMSR-E, i. e., flying at 705 km of altitude with an <b>observation</b> <b>angle</b> of 55 °. To single out the impact on surface emissivity, scattering of the radiation due to the atmosphere or neighboring elevated surfaces is not considered. C and X bands, for which atmospheric effects are negligible, and Ka band are analyzed. The results indicate that the changes in the local <b>observation</b> <b>angle</b> tend to lower the apparent emissivity of a radiometric pixel with respect to the corresponding flat surface characteristics. The effect of the rotation of the polarization plane enlarges (vertical polarization), or attenuates (horizontal polarization) this decrease. By doing some simplifying assumptions for the radiometer antenna, the conclusion is that the microwave emissivity at vertical polarization is underestimated, whilst the opposite occurs for horizontal polarization, except for Ka band, for which both under- and overprediction may occur. A quantification of the differences with respect to a flat soil and an approximate evaluation of their impact on soil moisture retrieval are yielded...|$|E
