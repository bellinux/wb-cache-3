5|$|In the <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> between Kehl and the Schutter, {{which lay}} downstream, the fortifications were equally secured. The redoubt there held about 8 cannons and 400 men, {{and covered the}} street between the hamlet of Auenheim and Kehl.|$|E
5|$|All the New Spain {{flotilla}} arrived safely at Vera Cruz during February and March 1553. The {{plan was}} to scrap eleven of the vessels and keep only five to make the return journey. This was typical. Ships from the Americas to Spain carried a much smaller volume of cargo than ships traveling in the <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> although the shipments to Spain included valuable gold and silver.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} January 2008, on {{the last}} day of the {{transfer}} window, Reid joined Sunderland in a three and a half-year deal worth £5m, making the step back up to the Premier League. Sunderland's Greg Halford went in the <b>other</b> <b>direction</b> in a six-month loan spell as part of the deal. Reid explained that he wanted Sunderland to be challenging for European places, and will not be happy fighting relegation season-after-season.|$|E

5|$|Faversham {{railway station}} opened in 1858. A former goods sheet built {{as part of}} the {{original}} railway works is now Grade I listed. Trains travel to London, terminating at either Victoria or St. Pancras International. In the <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> trains travel either to Dover Priory (via Canterbury East) or to Ramsgate (via Margate). Since 2009 Southeastern Highspeed links Faversham to High Speed 1, Ebbsfleet International, and London's Stratford International and London St Pancras stations.|$|E
5|$|Laevinus {{had begun}} {{exploring}} {{the possibility of}} an alliance with the Aetolian League, as early as 212 BC. The Aetolians, war weary, had made peace with Philip at Naupactus in 217 BC. However five years later the pendulum had swung in the <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> the war faction was on the ascendency, and the Aetolians were once again ready to consider taking up arms against their traditional enemy, Macedon.|$|E

5|$|Many {{new plant}} {{medicines}} arrived in Europe as products of Early Modern exploration {{and the resulting}} Columbian Exchange, in which livestock, crops and technologies were transferred between the Old World and the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. Medicinal herbs arriving in the Americas included garlic, ginger, and turmeric; coffee, tobacco and coca travelled in the <b>other</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E

In the <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> trains run hourly on the Stoke line (serving all stations to Kidsgrove, then Stoke). On the Crewe line, one train per hour runs to Alderley Edge serving all stations, and one train per hour serves the same stations {{and continues to}} Crewe.|$|E

5|$|The update rule is an {{injective}} function, that is, {{there are}} no two configurations that both map to the same common configuration. This condition is obviously implied by {{the assumption that the}} update rule is a bijection. In the <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> the Garden of Eden theorem for cellular automata implies that every injective update rule is bijective.|$|E
5|$|By December, {{there was}} still no word of García de Celís, nor had Spanish {{assistance}} arrived from any <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> and the Spanish at Buena Esperanza had lost hope. They were pressed on all sides by hostile natives, with resistance led by Sicumba. Cerezeda got word of a plan by Sicumba to assault Buena Esperanza and destroy it. In response he sent parties to seize and execute hostile Indian leaders, thus defusing the imminent threat, although Sicumba managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|For {{lines with}} three or four tracks with express service, local stops will have side {{platforms}} and the middle one or two tracks will not stop at the station. On these lines, express stations typically have two island platforms, one for the local and express in one direction, and another for the local and express in the <b>other</b> <b>direction.</b> Each island platform provides a cross-platform interchange between local and express services. Some lines with four-track express service have two tracks each on two levels and use both island and side platforms.|$|E

5|$|From 1863, part of King's Cross was an {{intermediate}} station. On the extreme {{east of the}} site, King's Cross York Road station was served by suburban trains from Finsbury before they followed the sharply curved and steeply graded York Road Tunnel to join the City Widened Lines to Farringdon, Barbican and Moorgate. In the <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> trains from Moorgate came off the Widened Lines via the Hotel Curve, to platform 16 (latterly renumbered 14) which rose to the main line level. Services to and from Moorgate were diverted via the Northern City Line from November 1976. The station remained in occasional use until it was completely closed on 5 March 1977.|$|E
5|$|Technically, the Kleinschmidt orthography {{focused upon}} morphology: the same derivational affix would {{be written in}} the same way in {{different}} contexts, despite its being pronounced differently in different contexts. The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system: Here, there was a clear link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written differently in different contexts. The differences are due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter) whereas going the <b>other</b> <b>direction</b> would require a full lexical analysis.|$|E
5|$|The time-reversed {{dynamics}} of the automaton can be described by another cellular automaton. Clearly, {{for this to be}} possible, the update rule must be bijective. In the <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> if the update rule is bijective, then it has an inverse function that is also bijective. This inverse function must be a cellular automaton rule. The proof of this fact uses the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of cellular automata rules as the translation-invariant functions that are continuous with respect to the Cantor topology on the space of configurations.|$|E

5|$|Translation {{problems}} are {{compounded by the}} women's confusion over which type of FGM they experienced, or even whether they experienced it. Several {{studies have suggested that}} survey responses are unreliable. A 2003 study in Ghana found that in 1995 four percent said they had not undergone FGM, but in 2000 said they had, while 11 percent switched in the <b>other</b> <b>direction.</b> In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it. In Sudan in 2006, a significant percentage of infibulated women and girls reported a less severe type.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{population}} of Downtown Miami nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, {{and is expected to}} increase by several thousand more in the current decade, largely due to many new high rise condo developments in the downtown area adding thousands of housing units which will benefit from having the tunnel. Although traffic and port activity has declined since the early 90's, losing some of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to see a large shift in the <b>other</b> <b>direction</b> after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States able to handle the New Panamax ships by 2016. Within the first month of opening, it was reported that congestion in the downtown area had eased.|$|E
5|$|Directed pseudoforests and endo{{function}}s are in {{some sense}} mathematically equivalent. Any function ƒ from a set X to itself (that is, an endomorphism of X) {{can be interpreted as}} defining a directed pseudoforest which has an edge from x to y whenever ƒ(x) = y. The resulting directed pseudoforest is maximal, and may include self-loops whenever some value x has ƒ(x) = x. Alternatively, omitting the self-loops produces a non-maximal pseudoforest. In the <b>other</b> <b>direction,</b> any maximal directed pseudoforest determines a function ƒ such that ƒ(x) is the target of the edge that goes out from x, and any non-maximal directed pseudoforest can be made maximal by adding self-loops and then converted into a function in the same way. For this reason, maximal directed pseudoforests are sometimes called functional graphs. Viewing a function as a functional graph provides a convenient language for describing properties that are not as easily described from the function-theoretic point of view; this technique is especially applicable to problems involving iterated functions, which correspond to paths in functional graphs.|$|E
