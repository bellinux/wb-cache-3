25|$|In {{southern}} Saskatchewan {{there was}} one main group of plains Indians who were called Assiniboine. They moved around the area that is modern day Willow Bunch. This band {{is thought to have}} arrived 11,000 years ago, just after the last glacier retreated. Like most bands at the time, this group moved where their food went. They depended on the bison for almost everything. They used the bison to make clothing, build their shelter and to make tools. Since they moved around a lot they made a very smart way of transporting their tipis. The poles of the tipis would make a sled <b>of</b> <b>sort</b> that was called a travois and would be pulled by dogs. This carried all that they needed and transported their home at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Basanoff {{has argued}} that the legend not only alludes to sex and {{fertility}} in its association with wildfig and goat but is in fact a summary <b>of</b> <b>sort</b> of all the qualities of Juno. As Juno Sespeis of Lanuvium Juno Caprotina is a warrior, a fertiliser and a sovereign protectress. In fact the legend presents a heroine, Tutela, who is a slightly disguised representation of the goddess: the request of the Latin dictator would mask an attempted evocatio of the tutelary goddess of Rome. Tutela indeed shows regal, military and protective traits, apart from the sexual ones. Moreover, according to Basanoff these too (breasts, milky juice, genitalia, present or symbolised in the fig and the goat) in general, and here in particular, have an inherently apotropaic value directly related to the nature of Juno. The occasion of the feria, shortly after the poplifugia, i.e. when the community is in its direst straits, needs the intervention of a divine tutelary goddess, a divine queen, since the king (divine or human) has failed to appear or has fled. Hence the customary battles under the wild figs, the scurrile language that bring together the second and third function. This festival would thus show a ritual that can prove the trifunctional nature of Juno.|$|E
