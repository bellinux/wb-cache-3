5|$|As the goalkeeper has {{the choice}} of how many hands they want to use, the {{decision}} should be made {{of what they want}} to do. A shot should be stopped with two hands either if it is weak or close to the goalkeeper's body, and normally stopped with one in <b>other</b> <b>circumstances.</b> This is because one-handed saves can go to the ball faster.|$|E

The term is synonymous with iena (家名) and kadona (角名). The term most often refers to the guild names of kabuki actors, but is also applicable to the names artists take from their masters or studios, names taken from one's business, and a few <b>other</b> similar <b>circumstances.</b>|$|R

5|$|After France surrendered, Marcinkus {{managed to}} make his way to the French colonies in Africa (Morocco and Algeria). He decided to go to Great Britain and {{continue}} fighting, but the French army's terms of armistice at Compiègne and tensions between Britain and France made this difficult. On 12 August 1940 he was finally demobilized from the French army. Marcinkus and some of his associates concocted a daring plan to commandeer several aircraft without authorization and fly to England. The plan was not executed due to increased security at airfields and <b>other</b> <b>circumstances.</b> He finally received the necessary documents enabling him to go to Britain in autumn of 1940.|$|E

5|$|After touring {{with her}} former group Fugees, Hill became {{involved}} in a romantic relationship with Jamaican entrepreneur Rohan Marley, and shortly after, became pregnant with his child. This pregnancy, as well as <b>other</b> <b>circumstances</b> in her life, inspired Hill to make a solo album. Recording sessions for the album took place from late 1997 to June 1998 mainly at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, as Hill collaborated {{with a group of}} musicians known as New Ark in writing and producing the songs. Primarily a neo soul album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill incorporates musical styles from R, hip hop, soul, and reggae. Its lyrics touch upon Hill's pregnancy and the turmoil within the Fugees, along with themes of love and God. The album's title was inspired by the film and autobiographical novel The Education of Sonny Carson, and Carter G. Woodson's The Mis-Education of the Negro.|$|E
5|$|Family {{relationships}} {{are a common}} type of connection between gods. Deities often form male and female pairs, reflecting the importance of procreation in Egyptian religious thought. Families of three deities, with a father, mother, and child, represent {{the creation of new}} life and the succession of the father by the child, a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession. Osiris, Isis, and Horus formed the quintessential family of this type. The pattern they set grew more widespread over time, so that many deities in local cult centers, like Ptah, Sekhmet, and their child Nefertum at Memphis and Amun, Mut, and Khonsu at Thebes, were assembled into family triads. Genealogical connections like these are changeable, in keeping with the multiple perspectives in Egyptian belief. Hathor, as a fertility goddess, could act as mother to any child god, including the child form of the sun god, although in <b>other</b> <b>circumstances</b> she was the sun god's daughter.|$|E

Juliet says good-bye to her sister, Rachel, {{promising}} to be back before her baby is born. In the airport terminal, Alpert pours sedative into a glass of orange juice and gives it to Juliet to drink, explaining that the trip is very intense. Juliet is wary of drinking the juice, even though she is okay with the <b>other</b> <b>circumstances</b> surrounding the trip. Alpert interrupts and tells her the place she is going is very special and that she has a gift with which she is supposed to do something significant. Juliet drinks the orange juice and passes out. She wakes up in a submarine with her arms and waist strapped down for safety.|$|E

5|$|The {{goldcrest}} is monogamous. The male sings {{during the}} breeding season, usually while foraging {{rather than from}} a perch. It has a display involving bowing its head towards another bird and raising the coloured crest. Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests, but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great. A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between species, and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs, were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered the other; in <b>other</b> <b>circumstances,</b> the two species learned to ignore each other's songs. However, in very small areas of conifers it is rare for the goldcrest and the firecrest to share territories; either {{one or the other}} is present, but not both. A male goldcrest will defend his territory against either species, sometimes including some firecrest phrases in his song.|$|E

After Rudd's unsuccessful leadership challenge in February 2012, Gillard appointed Bob Carr to succeed Rudd as Foreign Affairs Minister. When Gillard was not present in the Australia due to international commitments, or in <b>other</b> <b>circumstances,</b> Wayne Swan assumed the title of acting prime minister; when neither leader nor deputy were present in Australia, Leader of the Government in the Senate Chris Evans assumed the role, as occurred in October and November 2012.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{chemistry}} {{is similar to}} the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals, nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless. The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure, and in <b>other</b> <b>circumstances</b> where ionic radius is a determining factor, the chemistry of zinc has much in common with that of magnesium. In other respects, there is little similarity with the late first-row transition metals. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known.|$|E

5|$|On July 11, 1914, Ruth {{arrived in}} Boston with Egan and Shore. Ruth later {{told the story}} of how that morning he had met Helen Woodford, who was the girl that would be his first wife. She was a 16-year-old {{waitress}} at Landers Coffee Shop, and Ruth related that she served him when he had breakfast there. Other stories, though, suggested that the meeting occurred on another day, and perhaps under <b>other</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Regardless of when he began to woo his first wife, he won his first game as a pitcher for the Red Sox that afternoon, 4–3, over the Cleveland Naps. His catcher was Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager. Shore was given a start by Carrigan the next day; he won that and his second start and thereafter was pitched regularly. Ruth lost his second start, and was thereafter little used. As a batter in his major-league debut, Ruth went 0-for-2 against left-hander Willie Mitchell, striking out in his first at bat, before being removed for a pinch hitter in the seventh inning. Ruth was not much noticed by the fans, as Bostonians watched the Red Sox's crosstown rivals, the Braves, begin a legendary comeback that would take them from last place on the Fourth of July to the 1914 World Series championship.|$|E
