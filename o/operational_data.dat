5|$|Specifying power levels over 100% {{may seem}} nonsensical, {{but there was}} a logic behind it. The 100% level does not mean the maximum {{physical}} power level attainable, rather it was a specification decided on during engine development—the expected rated power level. When later studies indicated the engine could operate safely at levels above 100%, these higher levels became standard. Maintaining the original relationship of power level to physical thrust helps reduce confusion, as it created an unvarying fixed relationship so that test data (or <b>operational</b> <b>data</b> from past or future missions) can be easily compared. If the power level was increased, and that new value was said to be 100%, then all previous data and documentation would either require changing, or cross-checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100% power level on that date. Engine power level affects engine reliability, with studies indicating the probability of an engine failure increasing rapidly with power levels over 104.5%, which was why power levels above 104.5% were retained for contingency use only.|$|E

40|$|Considering the {{shortages}} {{of the general}} <b>operational</b> risk <b>data</b> model, a new <b>operational</b> risk <b>data</b> model [...] <b>operational</b> risk topological <b>data</b> model is brought forward in this paper. It can not only contain {{the information about the}} connection between all risk causes during the risk event happening process, but also can support the operational risk measurement by influence diagrams approach. In the <b>operational</b> risk topological <b>data</b> model, a risk loss event is attributed to risk trigger cause which lead to the initial loss and successor causes which increase (sometimes maybe decrease) the initial loss. The record includes the initial loss of the trigger cause and the loss effect multiples of each successor cause. Then the integrated analyses and assessment of operational risk is studied by an influence diagrams approach based on topological <b>data</b> model. <b>Operational</b> risk influence diagrams can not only assist the analysis of correlation between all the causes, but also can support the statistic analysis to <b>operational</b> risk <b>data</b> in the topological data model. The calculation of operational risk influence diagrams has three steps: calculating the company’s operational risk loss severity distribution by the influence diagrams probabilistic inference; calculating the company’s operational risk loss frequency distribution by the frequency of trigger causes; and combinin...|$|R

We demonstrate that ignoring such thresholds leads to biases in corresponding parameter estimates when the threshold is ignored. Using publicly available <b>operational</b> loss <b>data,</b> we analyze the effects of model misspecification on resulting expected loss, Value-at-Risk, and Conditional Value-at-Risk figures and show that underestimation of the regulatory capital is a consequence of such model error.

40|$|We use robust {{statistical}} methods to analyze <b>operational</b> loss <b>data.</b> Commonly used classical estimators of model parameters may be sub-optimal under minor departures {{of data from}} the model assumptions. <b>Operational</b> loss <b>data</b> are characterized by a very heavy right tail of the loss distribution attributed to several “low frequency/high severity ” events. Classical estimators may produce biased estimates of parameters leading to unreasonably high estimates of mean, variance, and the operational VaR and CVaR measures. The main objective of robust methods is to focus the analysis on the fundamental properties of {{the bulk of the}} data, without being distorted by outliers. We argue that further comparison of results obtained under the classical and robust procedures can serve as a basis for the VaR sensitivity analysis and can lead {{to an understanding of the}} economic role played by these extreme events.
