Immature specimens are known from both females and males, and immature males often have small crests similar to adult females.

The designs were otherwise similar, using a low-mounted delta-wing; the primary advantages of the C104/2 were a larger <b>overall</b> <b>size</b> which offered a much larger internal weapons bay, at the time a cutting-edge feature in a fighter, and gave it twin-engine reliability. The proposals were submitted to the RCAF in June 1952.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{generally}} {{agree that}} a dramatic reduction in the <b>overall</b> <b>size</b> of the Congolese population occurred during the two-decades of Free State rule in the Congo. Populations always fluctuate over time and notable shifts, known as demographic crises, are well-attested in pre-industrial societies. Noted examples include the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. It is argued that {{the reduction in the}} Congo was atypical and {{can be attributed to the}} direct and indirect effects of colonial rule and especially to disease and falling birthrate. Estimates of the size of the overall population decline (or mortality displacement) remain disputed but range between two and 13 million.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} half-light radius {{includes}} {{stars in the}} outer part of the cluster that happen to lie {{along the line of}} sight, so theorists will also use the half-mass radius (r'm)—the radius from the core that contains half the total mass of the cluster. When the half-mass radius of a cluster is small relative to the <b>overall</b> <b>size,</b> it has a dense core. An example of this is Messier 3 (M3), which has an overall visible dimension of about 18 arc minutes, but a half-mass radius of only 1.12 arc minutes.|$|E
5|$|The broad-billed parrot's {{head was}} large in {{proportion}} to its body, {{and there was a}} distinct crest of feathers {{on the front of the}} head.

Subfossil bones indicate that the species exhibited greater sexual dimorphism in <b>overall</b> <b>size</b> and head size than any living parrot.

Therefore, the height of the mantapa and the <b>overall</b> <b>size</b> of the temple were limited by the length of the stone shafts that the architects were able to obtain from the quarries. The height of the temple was also constrained by the weight of the superstructure on the walls and, since Chalukyan architects did not use mortar, by the use of dry masonry and bonding stones without clamps or cementing material.|$|E

5|$|After {{slightly}} weakening {{throughout the}} day on August6, Felicia leveled out with winds of 135mph (215km/h) and a 23mi (37km) wide eye as the storm developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, which would allow Felicia to maintain a high intensity over marginally warm waters. Early the next day, {{the structure of the}} hurricane quickly deteriorated as convection became asymmetric and cloud tops warmed significantly. This marked a quick drop in intensity of the storm to a minimal Category 3 hurricane. Several hours later, the mid-level circulation began to separate from the low-level circulation and the <b>overall</b> <b>size</b> of the storm decreased. By this time, the storm began to take a long-anticipated westward turn towards Hawaii. After briefly re-intensifying on August7, Felicia weakened to a Category 1 hurricane early on August8.

5|$|Appian {{claims that}} Lucullus had {{embarked}} from Rome {{with only a}} single legion; upon entering Anatolia to make war against Mithridates, he added four more legions to his army. The <b>overall</b> <b>size</b> of this force consisted of 30,000 infantry and 1,600 cavalry. Following Mithridates' retreat to Armenia, Appian estimates Lucullus' invading force to be only two legions and 500 horsemen, although it is highly improbable {{that he would have}} undertaken the invasion of Armenia with such a small army. Historian Adrian Sherwin-White places the size of Lucullus' force to 12,000 seasoned legionaries (composed of three legions), and 4,000 provincial cavalry and light infantry. The Roman army was further bolstered by several thousand allied Gallic, Thracian, and Bithynian infantry and cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Until the Song dynasty took {{advantage}} of a large rebellion within the Liao Kingdom in 1125, the Song had to conduct cordial relations with the Liao. Skilled ambassadors were sent on missions to court the Liao and maintain peace, such as the renowned horologist, engineer, and state minister Su Song. The Song also prepared for armed conflict, increasing the <b>overall</b> <b>size</b> {{of the armed forces}} to a million soldiers by 1022. By that time, however, the military was consuming three-quarters of the tax revenues gathered by the state, compared to a mere 2 or 3 percent of state income that would be consumed by just providing the Liao with tribute. Due to these circumstances, intense political rivalries would later arise in the Song court over how to handle these issues.|$|E

5|$|Confusion {{with the}} highly {{regarded}} miller or sweetbread mushroom (Clitopilus prunulus) {{is a common}} cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish-white downy cap and whitish decurrent gills which turn pink with maturity. Young fruit bodies of Entoloma sinuatum can also be confused with St George's mushroom (Calocybe gambosa), although the gills of the latter are crowded and cream in colour, and the clouded agaric (Clitocybe nebularis), which has whitish decurrent gills and an unusual odour. To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species. Its <b>overall</b> <b>size</b> and shape resemble members of the genus Tricholoma, although the spore colour (white in Tricholoma, pinkish in Entoloma) and shape (angular in Entoloma) help distinguish it. The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma (T.columbetta) has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, odour. E.sinuatum may be confused with Clitocybe multiceps in the Pacific Northwest of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps. A casual observer may mistake it for an edible field mushroom (Agaricus campestris), but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, and a dark brown spore print. The poorly known North American species E. albidum resembles E.sinuatum but is likewise poisonous.|$|E

40|$|Neural {{correlates}} of bird song involve {{the volume of}} particular song nuclei in the brain that govern song development, production, and perception. Intra- and interspecific variation in the volume of these song nuclei are associated with <b>overall</b> brain <b>size,</b> suggesting that the integration of complex songs into the brain requires general neural augmentation. In a comparative study of passerine birds based on generalized least square models, we tested this hypothesis by exploring the interspecific relationship between <b>overall</b> brain <b>size</b> and repertoire size. We found no significant association between song complexity of males and brain size adjusted for body size. However, species in which males produced complex songs tended to have sex differences in <b>overall</b> brain <b>size.</b> This pattern became stronger when we controlled statistically for female song complexity by using sex differences in song complexity. In species with large differences in song complexity, females evolved smaller brains than did males. Our results suggest no role {{for the evolution of}} extended neural space, as reflected by total brain size, owing to song complexity. However, factors associated with sexual selection mirrored by sex differences in song complexity were related to sexual dimorphism in <b>overall</b> brain <b>size.</b> Copyright 2005. bird song; brain size; comparative analysis; generalized least square models; repertoire size; sexual selection...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{problems}} of {{the design of the}} portable x-ray devices for the works under the field conditions is to get smallest possible weight and the <b>overall</b> <b>sizes.</b> The classical apparatuses, which contain thermo-emission X-ray tube and source of constant high voltage as a rule have weight about 15 - 30 kg, which strongly impedes their use in the nonstationary conditions. In the proposed work are described pulse X-ray machines containing tube with the cold cathode on the base of explosive electron emission. It explains the essence of explosive electron emission and the basic principles of the construction of the pulse X-ray emitters containing the cold cathode tube and the source of its power, capable to form the pulses of high voltage with an amplitude of 100 - 300 kV and with the duration of 10 - 9 s. Specifically with this duration and this voltage appears the effect of explosive electron emission, which is accompanied by the intensive flash of X-radiation.
