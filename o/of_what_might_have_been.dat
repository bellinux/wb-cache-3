25|$|In 1962 Corvette chief {{engineer}} Zora Arkus-Duntov initiated {{a program to}} produce a lightweight version based on a prototype that mirrored the new 1963 Corvette. Concerned about Ford {{and what they were}} doing with the Shelby Cobra, Duntov's program included plans to build 125 examples of the Corvette Grand Sport to allow the model to be homologated for international Grand Touring races. After the GM executives learned of the secret project, the program was stopped, and only five cars were built. All five cars have survived and are in private collections. They are among the most coveted and valuable Corvettes ever built, not because of what they accomplished, but because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b>|$|E

[...] It was reported that all the people at Eola came out to see the steamer and that [...] "many an old timer, who had {{in the early days}} built great air castles for the future greatness of Eola, dropped a silent tear in contemplation <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately, {{the promise}} of this far-sighted {{undertaking}} was far from being fulfilled in its performance. The magnificent opportunity which {{was given to the}} Commissioners to create a beautiful city simply was wasted and thrown away. ...

2500|$|A right-arm fast-medium bowler and {{a useful}} {{right-handed}} batsman, {{he played for}} Surrey from 1933 to 1949. Despite losing some <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> his best years to World War II, he took 729 first-class wickets at 26.06, with best innings figures of 10/67 in the second innings against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in 1939. He scored 6158 runs at 21.38, including two centuries. His highest score of 123 was made against a powerful Yorkshire attack at Bradford in 1934. The innings included [...] four 6s and fourteen 4s and took under two hours, as did his only other century.|$|E
2500|$|On December 3, 1956, Bush Terminal was {{the site}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the largest {{explosion}} in New York City history. Dockworkers were using an oxyacetylene torch to perform routine maintenance work when sparks ignited 26,365 pounds of ground foam rubber scrap. Employees abandoned initial efforts to control the blaze; 26 minutes later, the fire reached 37,000 pounds of Cordeau Detonant Fuse, setting off an explosion. The blast resulted in 10 deaths, 270 injuries, [...] "major destruction" [...] in a 1,000-foot radius, and broken windows a mile around. People 35 miles away reported hearing it. Miraculously, none of the firefighters on land or water was injured.|$|E
2500|$|Volcanism 22to 21million {{years ago}} {{constructed}} the Coquihalla Volcanic Complex about [...] northeast of Hope. It comprises volcanic and intrusive rocks that are calc-alkaline felsic to intermediate in composition. Coquihalla Mountain, the highest {{summit of the}} Bedded Range with an elevation of , is a major preserved stratovolcano and {{represents one of the}} few remaining Miocene volcanoes in southwestern British Columbia. As a result, the Coquihalla Volcanic Complex has been a subject of geological studies to annunciate the remains <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an extensive cover of volcanic rocks during the early Miocene epoch. The Coquihalla Complex also has a different igneous composition than Canadian Cascade Arc volcanoes that formed in the last two million years. Rhyolite tuffs are the primary igneous rocks comprising the Coquihalla Volcanic Complex, with small amounts of basalt or andesite present. This contrasts with modern Canadian Cascade volcanoes in that they are mainly composed of volcanic rocks in the basalt to andesite composition range, with few rocks of more felsic composition than dacite. Changes in magma composition have also occurred in the American portion of the Cascade Arc.|$|E
