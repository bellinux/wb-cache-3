5|$|Belton House is a Grade I listed {{country house}} in Belton near Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. The mansion is {{surrounded}} by formal gardens {{and a series of}} avenues leading to follies within a larger wooded park. Belton {{has been described as a}} compilation <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> finest of Carolean architecture, the only truly vernacular style of architecture that England had produced since the Tudor period. The house has also been described as the most complete example of a typical English country house; the claim has even been made that Belton's principal facade was the inspiration for the modern British motorway signs which give directions to stately homes. Only Brympton d'Evercy has been similarly lauded as the perfect English country house.|$|E

25|$|The La Nueva Viga seafood market {{next door}} alone handles about sixty percent <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{consumed}} {{in the country of}} Mexico. This market commercializes 1,500 tons per day and was built in the 1990s to replace the older La Viga Market, although the latter still operates. The next largest market is the Mercado del Mar in Zapopan, Jalisco, which commercializes about ten percent of all the seafood sold in Mexico. The {{governor of the state of}} Baja California and the Comision Nacional de Acuacutura y Pesca (Conapesca) is working on a project to open a wholesale seafood market in the state to compete with the La Nueva Viga and Mercado del Mar markets. One reason to put such a market here is that the seas around the Baja California peninsula produces about 75% of the country's seafood.|$|E
25|$|The {{natural law}} was {{inherently}} teleological, however, {{it is most}} assuredly not deontological. For Christians, natural law is how man manifests the divine image in his life. This mimicry of God's own life is impossible to accomplish except {{by means of the}} power of grace. Thus, whereas deontological systems merely require certain duties be performed, Christianity explicitly states that no one can, in fact, perform any duties if grace is lacking. For Christians, natural law flows not from divine commands, but from the fact that man is made in God's image, man is empowered by God's grace. Living the natural law is how man displays the gifts of life and grace, the gifts <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> good. Consequences are in God's hands, consequences are generally not within man's control, thus in natural law, actions are judged by three things: (1) the person's intent, (2) the circumstances of the act and (3) the nature of the act. The apparent good or evil consequence resulting from the moral act is not relevant to the act itself. The specific content of the natural law is therefore determined by how each person's acts mirror God's internal life of love. Insofar as one lives the natural law, temporal satisfaction {{may or may not be}} attained, but salvation will be attained. The state, in being bound by the natural law, is conceived as an institution whose purpose is to assist in bringing its subjects to true happiness. True happiness derives from living in harmony with the mind of God as an image of the living God.|$|E

However William Cobbett, in casual travel writing in 1822, said that [...] "A more ugly country between Egham (Surrey) and Kensington would with great difficulty be found in England. Flat as a pancake, and until you come to Hammersmith, the soil is a nasty, stony dirt upon a bed of gravel. Hounslow Heath which is only a little worse than the general run, is a sample <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> bad in soil and villainous in look.

500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} work as [...] "entertaining, {{thoughtful}} and eminently readable", although some thought it was too mournful in places.

They praised its independence of thought, wit, and feeling. Shelley's commentary on {{the social and political}} life of Italy, which was generally thought superior to the German sections, caused one reviewer to call the book the work of [...] "a woman who thinks for herself on all subjects, and who dares to say what she thinks", a woman with a [...] "masculine and original mind". Not all reviewers celebrated her independence of mind. The Observer wrote: [...] "With her, as with all women, politics is a matter of the heart, and not as with the more robust nature of man, of the head... It is an idle and unprofitable theme for a woman." [...] Most of the reviews responded positively to Shelley's political aims; those that were unsympathetic to her political position generally disputed her specific claims. For example, one reviewer claimed that Italy had been improved by Austrian rule.|$|E

The IQ was measured using the Raven′s test in these patients.

There {{was no significant difference in}} the IQ with respect to sex, age and irradiation dose. Conclusion: We can that reveal that CNS prophylaxis treatment, especially the combined treatment, is associated with IQ score decline in ALL survivors. Therefore,a baseline and an annual assessment of their educational progress are suggested...|$|R
