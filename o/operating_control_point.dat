40|$|Abstract—A {{concept for}} a generic voice based Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) <b>control</b> <b>point</b> (client) is {{presented}} in this paper which can be used to operate services on remote devices. Generic <b>control</b> <b>points</b> are a powerful alternative to special <b>control</b> <b>points</b> which are tailored to their special purposes. By using such a generic <b>control</b> <b>point</b> it is possible to control each UPnP device via voice without the need of manual adaptations. Starting from the analysis of the UPnP Device Architecture (UDA) and examination of the possibilities of voice supporting technologies we will show the feasibility of a generic voice based UPnP <b>control</b> <b>point</b> realization. The generic user interface is based on the standardized UPnP device and service description. Two different architectures will be introduced (coupled and decoupled solution) and their advantages, disadvantages and application will be discussed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that voice based configuration increases the user friendliness of <b>operating</b> a <b>control</b> <b>point.</b> Index Terms—UPnP, VoiceXML, voice user interfaces, generic user interfaces...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis explores how {{the number of}} <b>operating</b> access <b>control</b> <b>points</b> (ACPs) and their configuration of lanes and staffing affect vehicular flow into Naval Base San Diego (NBSD). We examine this flow during normal and non-normal operations, such as heightened force protection conditions. Our research focuses on factors that affect throughput as well as managing {{the costs associated with}} different staffing configurations. These factors include the force protection condition, vehicle type, number of passengers in the vehicle, and the type of credentials used. We study the importance of these factors using statistical techniques to analyze the data collected during site visits to NBSD. We also formulate and analyze queuing models of the ACPs to capture the impact of staffing configurations at the ACPs. Our analysis provides insight into how best to increase, or maintain, the throughput with current configurations and requirements. The data collected and analyzed in this thesis provide a solid foundation for future research and can easily be adapted to other Department of Defense installations where similar congestion is prevalent.

40|$|Self-calibrating designs have {{recently}} gained momentum {{as an alternative}} to methods relying on worst-case characterisation of silicon [2], [4], [8]. So far, reliable operation of existing link checkers—double sampling flip-flops or codebased—is not ensured over the whole range of bit error rate. Therefore, bit error rates where the checker reliability is poor are avoided either by worst-case characterisation of the link error rate (such as for double sampling flip-flops), or by constraining the operating point controller to avoid such regions (such as for code-based checkers). This paper proposes a novel checker architecture that bridges the gap between low overhead and high robustness over the whole error rate range. Specifically, we show how to combine optimally double sampling flip-flops with a code-based checker (in point of reliability). The resulting checker enables simple, efficient, and reliability-agnostic <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> <b>control</b> policies...|$|R
40|$|The thesis delineates a {{broadband}} {{infrared imaging}} technique {{to measure the}} flame equivalence ratio of a premixed combustor. The measurement technique {{can be used to}} provide feedback control signals for the operating point controller of a gas turbine combustor. Since gas turbines power plants meets a significant amount of the world 2 ̆ 7 s electricity demands the pollutant emissions from gas turbine combustors are a major environmental concern. Lean premixed combustors provide an excellent control over the emission of nitrogen oxides. However, combustion processes under lean conditions are susceptible to flame instabilities and flame blowout. Active instability suppression along with the <b>control</b> of <b>operating</b> equivalence ratio is necessary to operate combustors at fuel lean conditions. However, the closed loop <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> <b>control</b> system requires continuous feedback data of the combustor equivalence ratio. The broadband infrared imaging based measurement of combustor equivalence ratio is a promising technique for providing feedback signal for the operating point controller.

40|$|Recently, {{penetration}} {{of renewable energy}} sources is remarkable. However, it causes system frequency deviation that means decrease of system reliability. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes frequency control method using demand response (DR) and suppression of power output for renewable energy sources. It is assume that the consumption power of end-user is controlled automatically by smart appliances that decides the switch on/off using electric price. The electric price is given by real-time pricing method {{which is one of}} the DR methods. In addition, the suppression of power output for Photovoltaic Generator (PV) and Wind Generator (WG) is introduced. The suppression of power output for PV has been performed by <b>controlling</b> <b>operating</b> <b>point,</b> and that for WG is performed by controlling the pitch-angle of the blade. Furthermore, battery which has fast response characteristic is used, because the DR has slow response characteristic due to communication delay and mechanical delay.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{applications such}} as environment detection or disaster monitoring, the development of rapid low cost systems for collecting near real time spatial information is very critical. Rapid spatial information collection has become an emerging trend for remote sensing and mapping applications. In this study, a fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) -based spatial information acquisition platform that can <b>operate</b> in Ground <b>Control</b> <b>Point</b> (GCP) free environments is developed and evaluated. The proposed UAV based photogrammetric platform has a Direct Georeferencing (DG) module that includes a low cost Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) Inertial Navigation System (INS) / Global Positioning System (GPS) integrated system. The DG module is able to provide GPS single frequency carrier phase measurements for differential processing to obtain sufficient positioning accuracy. All necessary calibration procedures are implemented. Ultimately, a flight test is performed to verify the positioning accuracy in DG mode without using GCPs. The preliminary results of positioning accuracy in DG mode illustrate that horizontal positioning accuracies in the x and y axes are around 5 m at 300 m flight height above the ground. The positioning accuracy of the z axis is below 10 m. Therefore, the proposed platform is relatively safe and inexpensive for collecting critical spatial information for urgent response such as disaster relief and assessment applications where GCPs are not available...|$|R
