25|$|The {{three top}} layers in the OSI model, i.e. the {{application}} layer, the presentation layer and the session layer, are not distinguished separately in the TCP/IP model which only has an application layer above the transport layer. While some pure <b>OSI</b> <b>protocol</b> applications, such as X.400, also combined them, {{there is no}} requirement that a TCP/IP protocol stack must impose monolithic architecture above the transport layer. For example, the NFS application protocol runs over the eXternal Data Representation (XDR) presentation protocol, which, in turn, runs over a protocol called Remote Procedure Call (RPC). RPC provides reliable record transmission, so it can safely use the best-effort UDP transport.|$|E
50|$|OSGP {{follows a}} modern, {{structured}} approach {{based on the}} <b>OSI</b> <b>protocol</b> model to meet the evolving challenges of the smart grid.|$|E
50|$|He {{has worked}} on Internet {{technologies}} since 1980, {{and was one of}} the principal engineers behind the ISO Development Environment (ISODE) open-source implementation of the <b>OSI</b> <b>protocol</b> stack.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{elements}} of an object-oriented {{implementation of the}} upper layer <b>OSI</b> <b>protocols</b> are presented. Our goal in the paper is two-fold. First, to communicate to software engineers, particularly those developing systems software, that object-oriented programming techniques facilitate and enhance the implementation of layered architectures. Second, to convey to language designers our experience using object-oriented language features in building communications protocols. We focus on the requirements for the upper layer <b>OSI</b> <b>protocols</b> and illustrate how inheritance, subtyping, and polymorphic function effect their implementation...|$|R
50|$|It was {{originally}} {{expected that the}} <b>OSI</b> <b>protocols</b> would supersede TCP/IP, thus TLI is designed from an OSI model-oriented viewpoint, corresponding to the OSI transport layer. Otherwise, TLI looks similar, API-wise, to sockets.|$|R
5000|$|Testing and Test Control Notation is {{the only}} internationally {{standard}} testing language. TTCN3 [...] provides a broader applicability, as compared to earlier versions of TTCN, which were primarily focused on <b>OSI</b> <b>protocols</b> only.|$|R
50|$|This list {{shows some}} {{protocols}} that are commonly {{placed in the}} transport layers of the Internet protocol suite, the <b>OSI</b> <b>protocol</b> suite, NetWare's IPX/SPX, AppleTalk, and Fibre Channel.|$|E
50|$|Based on the {{principles}} of protocol layering in <b>OSI,</b> <b>protocol</b> encapsulation, not specifically GRE, breaks the layering order. It may be viewed as a separator between two different protocol stacks, one acting as a carrier for another.|$|E
50|$|Data General's {{proprietary}} networking architecture {{was known}} as Xodiac. Data General software packages supporting Xodiac included Comprehensive Electronic Office (CEO). In 1987, Data General announced its intention to replace Xodiac with the Open Systems Interconnection (<b>OSI)</b> <b>protocol</b> suite.|$|E
50|$|Another {{reference}} {{model used}} for layering is the OSI seven layer model, {{which can be}} applied to any protocol, not just the <b>OSI</b> <b>protocols.</b> In particular, the Internet Protocol can be analysed using the OSI model.|$|R
50|$|Neither the OSI Reference Model nor <b>OSI</b> <b>protocols</b> {{specify any}} {{programming}} interfaces, other than deliberately abstract service specifications. Protocol specifications precisely define the interfaces between different computers, but the software interfaces inside computers, known as network sockets are implementation-specific.|$|R
50|$|The {{layering}} scheme from ISO {{is called}} the OSI model or ISO layering. The functionality of the layers has been described in the section {{on the future of}} standardization and an overview of protocols using this scheme is given in the article on <b>OSI</b> <b>protocols.</b>|$|R
5000|$|TTCN-3 is {{the only}} {{currently}} available, internationally standardized testing language. Prior to TTCN3, its earlier versions were having limited functionality and limited scope over <b>OSI</b> <b>protocol.</b> But, TTCN3 is an advanced version and has broader applicability.Characteristics of TTCN3 are: ...|$|E
50|$|Despite clear primary {{references}} and normative standards documents, the internet layer is often improperly called network layer. This is done because the internet {{layer of the}} TCP/IP model is easily compared directly with the network layer (layer 3) in the Open Systems Interconnection (<b>OSI)</b> <b>protocol</b> stack.|$|E
50|$|X.500 {{directory}} {{services were}} traditionally accessed via the X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP), which required the Open Systems Interconnection (<b>OSI)</b> <b>protocol</b> stack. LDAP was {{originally intended to}} be a lightweight alternative protocol for accessing X.500 directory services through the simpler (and now widespread) TCP/IP protocol stack. This model of directory access was borrowed from the DIXIE and Directory Assistance Service protocols.|$|E
40|$|The main {{elements}} and requirements of advanced space data networks are identified. The communication protocol {{standards for use}} on space missions during the coming decades are described. In particular, the blending of high-performance space-unique data transmission techniques with off-the-shelf open systems interconnection (<b>OSI)</b> <b>protocols</b> is described...|$|R
5000|$|In practice, from 1995 {{interest}} in OSI implementations declined, and worldwide {{the deployment of}} standards-based networking services since have been predominantly based on the Internet protocol suite. [...] However, the Defense Messaging System continued {{to be based on}} the <b>OSI</b> <b>protocols</b> X.400 and X.500, due to their integrated security capabilities.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the business process standardization for telecom service providers started with {{the founding of the}} TM Forum in 1988. The initial goal was to facilitate the creation of 'interoperable network management products'. The first approved standard was the 'OSI/NM Forum Protocol Specification,' an extension of <b>OSI</b> <b>protocols</b> developed since the late 1970s.|$|R
50|$|The IS-IS {{protocol}} {{was developed by}} Digital Equipment Corporation as part of DECnet Phase V. It was standardized by the ISO in 1992 as ISO 10589 for communication between network devices that are termed Intermediate Systems (as opposed to end systems or hosts) by the ISO. The purpose of IS-IS was to make possible the routing of datagrams using the ISO-developed <b>OSI</b> <b>protocol</b> stack called CLNS.|$|E
50|$|Is an <b>OSI</b> <b>protocol</b> deployment. CLNS is {{the service}} {{provided}} by the Connectionless-mode Network Protocol (CLNP). CLNP is widely used in many telecommunications networks around the world because IS-IS (an OSI routing protocol) is mandated by the ITU-T as the protocol for management of Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) elements. From August 1990 to April 1995 the NSFNET backbone supported CLNP in addition to TCP/IP. However, CLNP usage remained low compared to TCP/IP.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a session-layer {{protocol}} is the <b>OSI</b> <b>protocol</b> suite session-layer protocol, also known as X.225 or ISO 8327. In case of a connection loss this protocol may try to recover the connection. If a connection is not used for a long period, the session-layer protocol may close it and re-open it. It provides for either full duplex or half-duplex operation and provides synchronization points in the stream of exchanged messages.|$|E
50|$|The goal of FTAM is {{to combine}} {{into a single}} {{protocol}} both file transfer, similar in concept to the Internet FTP, as well as remote access to open files, similar to NFS. However, like the other <b>OSI</b> <b>protocols,</b> FTAM has not been widely adopted, and the TCP/IP based Internet has become the dominant global network.|$|R
50|$|Because the Open Systems Interconnection {{protocols}} {{are challenging}} to implement, the original MMS stack never became popular. In 1999, Boeing {{created a new}} version of MMS using Internet protocols instead of the bottom four layers of the original stack plus RFC 1006 ("ISO Transport over TCP") in the transport layer. The top three layers use the same <b>OSI</b> <b>protocols</b> as before.|$|R
5000|$|... 1990 - The US {{specification}} requiring Open Systems Interconnection (<b>OSI)</b> <b>protocols</b> {{was first}} published as Federal Information Processing Standards document FIPS 146-1. The requirement for US Government vendors to demonstrate their support for this profile led them to join the formal interoperability and conformance testing for networking products, which had been done by industry professionals at the annual InterOp show since 1980.|$|R
5000|$|The {{challenges}} [...] affecting MANETs span {{from various}} {{layers of the}} <b>OSI</b> <b>protocol</b> stack. The media access layer (MAC) has be to improved to resolve collisions and hidden terminal problems. The network layer routing protocol has to be improved to resolve dynamically changing network topologies and broken routes. The transport layer protocol has to be improved to handle lost or broken connections. The session layer protocol {{has to deal with}} discovery of servers and services.|$|E
5000|$|The cross-layer network {{architecture}} of CN in is also named as Embedded Wireless Interconnection (EWI) {{as opposed to}} Open System Interconnection (<b>OSI)</b> <b>protocol</b> stack. The CN architecture {{is based on a}} new definition of wireless linkage. The new abstract wireless links are redefined as arbitrary mutual co-operations among a set of neighboring (proximity) wireless nodes. In comparison, traditional wireless networking relies on point-to-point [...] "virtual wired-links" [...] with a predetermined pair of wireless nodes and allotted spectrum.|$|E
50|$|Directory Access Protocol (DAP) is a {{computer}} networking standard promulgated by ITU-T and ISO in 1988 for accessing an X.500 directory service. DAP {{was intended to be}} used by client computer systems, but was not popular as there were few implementations of the full <b>OSI</b> <b>protocol</b> stack for desktop computers available to be run on the hardware and operating systems typical of that time. The basic operations of DAP: Bind, Read, List, Search, Compare, Modify, Add, Delete and ModifyRDN, were adapted for the Novell Directory Services (NDS) and the Internet Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).|$|E
5000|$|This {{version of}} MMS used seven layers of <b>OSI</b> network <b>protocols</b> as its {{communication}} stack: ...|$|R
5000|$|XNS {{also helped}} to {{validate}} {{the design of the}} 4.2BSD network subsystem by providing a second protocol suite, one which was significantly different from the Internet protocols; by implementing both stacks in the same kernel, Berkeley researchers demonstrated that the design was suitable for more than just IP. [...] Additional BSD modifications were eventually necessary to support the full range of Open Systems Interconnection (<b>OSI)</b> <b>protocols.</b>|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Federal Government has {{mandated}} {{use of the}} International Standards Organization`s Open Systems Interconnection (<b>OSI)</b> <b>protocols</b> {{throughout all}} federal computer network services and products. A Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) was adopted February 15, 1989 and enforcement began August 15, 1990. This FIPS describes, in publication 146, national policy mandating use of a functional profile of <b>OSI</b> approved <b>protocols</b> relevant to the federal government. Law requires all federal agencies purchasing network services and products to specify the Government OSI Profile, called GOSIP. This standard is compulsory and binding for all procurements of new networking products and services and for major upgrades to existing computer networks. This paper provides a discussion of GOSIP...|$|R
50|$|The <b>OSI</b> <b>protocol</b> stack is {{structured}} into seven conceptual layers. The layers form {{a hierarchy of}} functionality starting with the physical hardware components to the user interfaces at the software application level. Each layer receives information from the layer above, processes it and passes {{it down to the}} next layer. Each layer adds encapsulation information (header) to the incoming information before it is passed to the lower layer. Headers generally include address of source and destination, error control information, protocol identification and protocol parameters such as flow control options and sequence numbers.|$|E
50|$|Implementations of X.5002005 and LDAPv3 have {{occurred}} worldwide but are primarily located in major data centers with administrative policy boundaries regarding sharing of personal information. Since combined X.500 2005 and LDAPv3 directories can hold millions of unique objects for rapid access, {{it is expected}} to play a continued role for large scale secure identity access services. LDAPv3 can act as a lightweight standalone server, or in the original design as a TCP-IP based Lightweight Directory Access Protocol compatible with making queries to a X.500 mesh of servers which can run the native <b>OSI</b> <b>protocol.</b>|$|E
50|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{load testing}} software provides record and playback capabilities like regression testing tools. Load testing tools analyze the entire <b>OSI</b> <b>protocol</b> stack whereas most regression testing tools focus on GUI performance. For example, a regression testing tool will record and playback a mouse click on {{a button on}} a web browser, but a load testing tool will send out hypertext the web browser sends after the user clicks the button. In a multiple-user environment, load testing tools can send out hypertext for multiple users with each user having a unique login ID, password, etc.|$|E
50|$|CMIP is {{implemented}} {{in association with}} the ACSE and ROSE protocols. Both are Layer 7 <b>OSI</b> <b>protocols</b> (Application Layer). ACSE is used to manage associations between management applications (i.e. manage connections between CMIP agents). ROSE is employed for all data exchange interactions. Besides the presence of these Layer 7 protocols, CMIP assumes the presence of all OSI layers at lower levels but does not explicitly specify what these should be.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s {{the need}} {{to choose between the}} <b>OSI</b> <b>protocols</b> and the Internet Protocol (IP) became the subject of a {{long-lasting}} controversy, but by the early 1990s IP became the dominant protocol in data networking. In 1991, Neggers {{was one of the people}} leading the initiative to create a project called Ebone as an interim solution while the European research networking community made the transition from OSI to IP.|$|R
50|$|This service {{provides}} {{protection against}} unauthorized {{use of resources}} accessible via OSI. These may be OSI or non-OSI resources accessed via <b>OSI</b> <b>protocols.</b> This protection service may be applied to various types of access to a resource (e.g., {{the use of a}} communications resource; the reading, the writing, or the deletion of an information resource; the execution of a processing resource) or to all accesses to a resource.|$|R
