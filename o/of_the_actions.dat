5|$|A Confession of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> of the Assembly during {{the writing of the}} Confession, it is clear that there were {{significant}} debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.|$|E

The firemen remained in place until about 5:00am, when they had extinguished the last remaining flames and the police and soldiers had been replaced by new shifts.|$|E

5|$|Shakespeare {{also uses}} sub-plots {{to offer a}} clearer view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> of the main characters. For example, when the play begins, Romeo {{is in love with}} Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances. Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious {{contrast}} to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet's love and marriage. Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the sub-plot of the Montague–Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play's tragic end.|$|E

5|$|Wooller was a {{dissident}} {{member of the}} Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). In 1991, Wooller accused the ICAEW of having built-in bias when it marked examinations during a recession, and used PE II (Professional Education II) results to show the bias. Wooller was fined by the ICAEW in 1995 for promoting unaccredited MBA courses. Wooller formed a ginger group when the ICAEW tried to merge with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) in 1995. Wooller's ginger group opposed many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> of the ICAEW. The merger was shelved after {{the majority of the}} ICAEW members voted against it. The ginger group decided to keep fighting for democratic reforms and in June 1996, demanded that the executive of the ICAEW be elected directly by the 109,000 members of the body, instead of by the ICAEW's council of seventy members. A year later, Wooller demanded that members of the ICAEW be allowed to vote on Peter Gerrard's key constitutional reform proposals, and Wooller's motion failed by 1,400 votes, including proxies.|$|E

40|$|Action {{potentials}} {{were recorded}} from single cells isolated from rat and guinea-pig ventricular muscle. In rat cells the repolarization showed two distinct phases, {{referred to as}} the early and late phases. In guinea-pig cells there was a maintained plateau. Reducing external sodium by replacement with lithium or choline suppressed <b>the</b> late phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> potential in rat cells, and shortened <b>the</b> plateau <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> potential in guinea-pig cells. Intracellular EGTA abolished contraction while suppressing <b>the</b> late phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> potential in rat cells, and shortening the plateau in guinea-pig cells. Ryanodine (1 microM), which is thought to inhibit <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> calcium from internal stores, suppressed contraction and <b>the</b> late phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> potential in rat cells. In guinea-pig cells, there was no substantial effect of ryanodine (1 microM) on either contraction or <b>the</b> time course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> potential. <b>The</b> late phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> potential in rat cells was suppressed by increasing the external potassium concentration to 12 mM, and enhanced by reducing external potassium to 1. 2 mM. It is concluded that an inward current activated by internal calcium contributes to <b>the</b> late phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> potential in rat cells, and to the plateau in guinea-pig cells. Two possibilities are a current arising from electrogenic sodium-calcium exchange, and a current through ion channels activated by calcium. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> reducing external sodium would be consistent with either mechanism.
