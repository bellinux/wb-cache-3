5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, {{it was hard to see}} how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E

5|$|Upon her {{graduation}} {{at the end}} of 1902, Mayo took up {{a position}} as a resident medical officer at the Adelaide Hospital. In February 1904, she left for England to gain practical experience. There she worked as a clinical clerk at the Hospital for Sick Children in Great Ormond Street, London. To gain experience in midwifery, she went to Coombe Women's Hospital in Dublin, and after returning to London to complete a course in tropical medicine, she travelled to India where she worked for a year as a midwife in a Cambridge Mission to Delhi hospital for women and children. In 1906, Mayo returned to Adelaide and started a private practice in premises owned by her father on Morphett Street, next to the family home. With spare time <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> she began laboratory work at the Adelaide Hospital and took up an appointment as honorary anaesthetist at the Adelaide Children's Hospital.|$|E

25|$|On March 26, 2004, Austin {{allegedly}} assaulted {{his girlfriend}} Tess Broussard during a dispute at his Texas home, {{according to a}} San Antonio Police Department report. Broussard claimed that Austin grabbed her, and she began struggling with him, who eventually threw her to the ground.

25|$|In {{one of the}} Inuit {{myths of}} the Sun and the Moon, the sun deity Sukh-eh-nukh —known as Malina in Greenland carries an oil lamp which gets {{overturned}} spilling oil and soot <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and she blackens the face of her brother, the moon deity Ahn-ing-ah-neh (Anningan).

25|$|At 12:10a.m. on June 13, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman {{were found}} murdered outside of Nicole's Bundy Drive {{condominium}} in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles.

Both victims had been dead for about two hours prior to being discovered by police. Robert Riske, one of the first two officers on the scene, found a single bloody glove, among other evidence.|$|E

25|$|Still {{tied to the}} fence, Shepard {{was in a coma}} 18 {{hours after}} the attack when he was {{discovered}} by Aaron Kreifels, a cyclist who initially mistook Shepard for a scarecrow. Reggie Fluty, the first police officer to arrive at the scene, found Shepard alive but covered in blood. The medical gloves issued by the Albany County Sheriff's Department were faulty, and Fluty's supply ran out. She decided to use her bare hands to clear an airway in Shepard's bloody mouth. A day later, she was informed that Shepard was HIV positive, and she may have been exposed due to cuts <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> After taking an AZT regimen for several months, she tested negative for HIV. Judy Shepard later wrote she learned of her son's HIV status during his stay at the hospital following the attack.|$|E
25|$|Trap-jaw ants do {{not have}} similar {{stingers}} as bees. Instead, their stings are retractable and not barbed {{in order to be}} used again. The sting is located {{at the end of the}} abdomen and is completely covered by a sheath, a protective covering. Besides the momentary sting from the bite, O. bauri contains a mixture of formic acid and protein, which may have a high toxic activity, and is discharged after the ant bite. Within humans, there have been records of immediate burning at the site of the sting but that usually dissipates after an hour. However, there was one case in which a young girl had an intense allergic reaction to the bite. There were patches of red, itchy, swollen areas <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> arms, thorax and foot. Additionally, her eyelids were swollen. This lasted about a week and has been discovered in about 16% of ant bites.|$|E
25|$|Kate {{heard the}} crash, and knew an {{eastbound}} passenger train {{was due in}} Moingona about midnight, stopping shortly before heading east over the Des Moines River and then Honey Creek. She found the surviving crew members and shouted that she would get help, having to cross the Des Moines River bridge along the way. Although she started with a lantern, it went out, and she crawled the span <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and knees with only lightning for illumination. Once across, she had to cover about two miles on ground to the Moingona depot to sound the alarm. She then led a party back to rescue two of the crew members. Edgar Wood, perched in a tree, grasped a rope thrown to him, and came ashore hand-over-hand. Adam Agar couldn't be reached until the floodwaters began to recede. Pat Donahue's corpse was eventually found in a cornfield a quarter mile downstream from the bridge, but A.P. Olmsted was never found. The passenger train was stopped at Scranton, with about 200 aboard.|$|E

25|$|Leon, Fatboy and Peter {{plan to go}} to a {{party in}} Hampshire, but Lucy, Whitney and Zsa Zsa offer Leon a night out in the woods instead, {{planning}} revenge getting Lucy pregnant and lying to Zsa Zsa. In the woods, Zsa Zsa comes out with pig's blood <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> saying that she has been attacked. Knowing that it is a plan, Leon runs away and drunkenly ventures into the dark woods, cutting his hand. The next day the gang discover that Lucy let Leon run off and he was out all night. Peter and Fatboy then fear they hit Leon with the van the night before. Fatboy gets a voicemail from Leon saying he is hurt, and when he calls back, Zsa Zsa finds Leon's mobile phone in the leaves, smeared with blood. They decide to go to the police but Leon turns up, having been in police custody overnight for being drunk. Leon reveals that Lucy had an abortion and they all realise that Lucy was trying to turn them against him, so on their return to Walford, they play a prank on Lucy, leaving her humiliated. However, Lucy reveals to her father that they are squatting in one of his properties and he evicts them.|$|E
500|$|The defence {{also argued}} {{that people who have}} carried out {{so-called}} [...] "altruistic" [...] killings have been known to engage in ritualistic behaviour before killing themselves, and that Sheila might have placed the silencer in the cupboard, changed her clothes and washed herself, which would explain why there was little lead <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> or sugar from the floor on her feet. There was also a possibility that the blood in the silencer was not hers, but was a mixture of Nevill's and June's.|$|E
500|$|Mikami was {{indifferent}} to the main character's gender. During the early creation process, he left the decision to his staff, who ultimately chose a female character. Because P.N.03 {{takes place in a}} space colony, Mikami wanted Vanessa's country of origin to be ambiguous. To that end, she was given a combination of French, German, and English names. Vanessa's movements were animated freehand, without motion capture technology. The designers posed Vanessa crouched <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and knees to resemble a jaguar, as an homage to the Jaguar title. The staff integrated rhythmic motions to her maneuvers to emulate dancing and to make her appear stylish. Kobayashi wanted Vanessa to be a [...] "cool and sexy mercenary with a tough exterior that hides her dark past." [...] In retrospect, he was proud of the character's style and movements.|$|E
