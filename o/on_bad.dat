5|$|After {{the failed}} coup, Đông, Thi, Lieu {{and several other}} {{prominent}} officers fled to Tan Son Nhut and climbed aboard a C-47. They fled to Cambodia, where they were happily given asylum by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Cambodia and South Vietnam had been <b>on</b> <b>bad</b> terms; Cambodia {{turned a blind eye}} to Vietnamese communists using their territory as a staging ground, while Diệm and Nhu had tried to foment opposition and had supported attempts to overthrow the Cambodian leader. Nhu had failed in a 1959 attempt to assassinate Sihanouk with a parcel bomb, and both nations' leaders despised one another.|$|E
5|$|Artie {{reveals the}} origin of his {{disability}} to Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz), explaining that he was paralyzed {{in a car accident}} at the age of eight. He likens his wheelchair use to Tina's speech impediment. The two go on a date and kiss, but part <b>on</b> <b>bad</b> terms when Tina confesses that she has been faking her speech impediment since the sixth grade, in order to deflect attention from herself, but now feels she no longer needs to, having been given confidence by the glee club.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond {{had already}} been <b>on</b> <b>bad</b> terms with Peter of Angoulême, Latin Patriarch of Antioch. Taking {{advantage}} of a conflict between the patriarch and the papal legate, Peter Capuano, Bohemond restored the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, Symeon II, in early 1206 or 1207. Peter of Angoulême and the papal legate were reconciled and the patriarch excommunicated Bohemond, Symeon and the commune {{with the approval of}} the Holy See. He also imposed an interdict on Antioch, but the burghers ignored his decision and visited the Greek churches.|$|E

5|$|Captain Kikunori Kijima—Gotō's {{chief of}} staff and {{commander}} of the bombardment force during the return trip to the Shortland Islands after Gotō's death in battle—claimed that his force had sunk two American cruisers and one destroyer. Furutakas captain—who survived the sinking of his ship—blamed the loss of his cruiser <b>on</b> <b>bad</b> air reconnaissance and poor leadership from the 8th fleet staff under Admiral Mikawa. Although Gotō's bombardment mission failed, Jojima's reinforcement convoy was successful in delivering the crucial men and equipment to Guadalcanal. Aoba journeyed to Kure, Japan, for repairs that were completed on February 15, 1943. Kinugasa was sunk one month later during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.|$|E
5|$|Whether the Republican valley was {{abandoned}} after the Omaha attack is not recorded. The invading Omahas had camped on the Platte, undisturbed by the Chauis, {{on their way}} to the Kitkehahkis; this might indicate that the two Pawnee bands were <b>on</b> <b>bad</b> terms at the time. The power of the Omahas was broken soon thereafter: in about 1801, a smallpox epidemic spread from the Skidis to the Omahas, killing half of the tribe, Blackbird among them.|$|E
5|$|In 1656 {{relations}} between Rupert and Charles Louis deteriorated badly. Rupert {{had fallen in}} love with Louise von Degenfeld, one of his sister-in-law's maids of honour. One of Rupert's notes proffering his affections accidentally fell into the possession of Charles Louis' wife Charlotte, who believed it was written to her. Charlotte was keen to engage in an affair with Rupert and became unhappy when she was declined and the mistake explained. Unfortunately, von Degenfeld was uninterested in Rupert, but was engaged in an affair with Charles Louis—this was discovered in due course, leading to the annulment of the marriage. Rupert, for his part, was unhappy that Charles Louis could not endow him with a suitable estate, and the two parted <b>on</b> <b>bad</b> terms in 1657, Rupert refusing to ever return to the Palatinate again and taking up employment under Ferdinand III in Hungary.|$|E

5|$|Orr {{has been}} known to be {{fiercely}} loyal to former Bruin personnel and teammates. When Derek Sanderson had alcohol and prescription drug-abuse problems and wound up penniless, Orr spent his own money to ensure that Sanderson successfully completed rehab. Decades later, Orr and Sanderson went into business together managing finances for hockey players. Orr also helped out Bruins trainer John (Frosty) Forristall, his roommate during his first years with the Bruins, who had just been fired from the Tampa Bay Lightning for alcoholism in 1994. Forristall's drinking put him <b>on</b> <b>bad</b> terms with his brother John, so he returned to Boston jobless and soon afterwards was diagnosed with brain cancer. Orr took Forristall into his home for a year until he {{died at the age of}} 51. Orr was a pallbearer at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|With it {{looking as}} though Riley had murdered Lynsey, Doctor Browning is {{released}} from prison and sleeps with Mercedes upon his release whom he begins a relationship with. They spend Christmas with the McQueens' however Myra and Mercedes's relationship is still <b>on</b> <b>bad</b> terms. In order to help Mercedes fix {{her relationship with her}} mother, Doctor Browning makes a fake doctor's record claiming that Myra is dying from cancer. Myra and Mercedes fix their relationship as they both believe that Myra is dying. When Mercedes discovers the truth, she is furious with Doctor Browning although forgives him as he has helped her and Myra mend their relationship. Doctor Browning pretends that the doctors record was a mistake and that Myra is not dying. Because of this error, Doctor Browning's job is put on the line and his boss Davies demands sex with Mercedes in order to save Doctor Browning's career. Mercedes agrees to this, however, plans to scam Davies. Her scam fails and Davies almost rapes her, however she is saved by Doctor Browning.|$|E
5|$|Byzantium looked {{impressive}} when Manuel died in 1180, {{having just}} celebrated the betrothal {{of his son}} Alexios II to {{the daughter of the}} king of France. Thanks to the diplomacy and campaigning of Alexios, John, and Manuel, the empire was a great power, economically prosperous, and secure on its frontiers; but there were serious problems as well. Internally, the Byzantine court required a strong leader to hold it together, and after Manuel's death stability was seriously endangered from within. Some of the foreign enemies of the Empire were lurking on the flanks, waiting for a chance to attack, in particular the Turks in Anatolia, whom Manuel had ultimately failed to defeat, and the Normans in Sicily, who had already tried but failed to invade the Empire on several occasions. Even the Venetians, the single most important western ally of Byzantium, were <b>on</b> <b>bad</b> terms with the empire at Manuel's death in 1180. Given this situation, it would have taken a strong Emperor to secure the Empire against the foreign threats it now faced, and to rebuild the depleted Imperial Treasury. But Manuel's son was a minor, and his unpopular regency government was overthrown in a violent coup d'état. This troubled succession weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely.|$|E
