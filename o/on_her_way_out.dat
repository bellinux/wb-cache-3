5|$|During a lunchtime tryst in Phoenix, Arizona, a {{real estate}} {{secretary}} named Marion Crane discusses with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client drops off a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Her boss asks her to deposit {{the money in the}} bank, and she asks if she can take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off. Returning home, she begins to pack, deciding to steal the money and give it to Sam in Fairvale, California. She is seen by her boss <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of town, which makes her nervous. During the trip, she pulls over on the side of the road and falls asleep, only to be awakened by a state patrol officer. Suspicious about her nervous behavior, he notes her license plate number and follows her at a close distance. Hoping to shake his pursuit, Marion stops at an automobile dealership and trades in her Ford Mainline, with its Arizona license plates, for a Ford Custom 300 that has California tags.|$|E

25|$|During Gwyn's {{first years}} with Charles, {{there was little}} {{competition}} {{in the way of}} other mistresses: Barbara Palmer was <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> in most respects, certainly in terms of age and looks, while others, such as Moll Davis, kept quietly away from the spotlight of public appearances or Whitehall. Nell gave birth to her first son, Charles, on 8 May 1670. This was the King's seventh son — by five separate mistresses.|$|E
25|$|One day {{she leaves}} {{a gift for}} Charles, a nude {{photograph}} that she took of him asleep in the laboratory after lovemaking, and he begins to shun her. When a fellow scientist visits he claims sole credit for the technique she discovered. Angered by his rebuff and betrayal, Mary at first takes it out on Henry, but then decides to leave the island and return to London. <b>On</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> conspicuously dressed as a Jew once more, she presents to Mrs. Cavendish at their dinner table the picture of her naked husband.|$|E

On {{the way to}} the United States, Avon encountered the French 74-gun Regulus, which gave chase for eight hours, firing constantly, before de Starck was able to lose her in a squall. Avon arrived at Annapolis Royal on 30 October. On his return voyage he met up with a Royal Navy 74-gun ship with orders to go to Bermuda and then to take to Britain despatches from French Admiral Willaumez that Avon had taken from an American vessel she had examined <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the Chesapeake.

Among others she performed at [...] "White Party" [...] in Palm Springs on Sunday April 11, where Britney Spears wrote <b>on</b> <b>her</b> Twitter that she was <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> to check <b>out</b> Agnes.

500|$|Elle first {{appears in}} the episode [...] "Fight or Flight" [...] searching for Peter in Ireland. Peter has no {{recollection}} of his past and is staying with the owner of Wandering Rocks Pub, Ricky. Elle questions Rick about Peter's whereabouts and when he pretends not to know Peter, she kills him with a large bolt of electricity <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> the door. Later on, during a telephone conversation with Bob Bishop, her father and Company head, she dismisses the murder as trivial and insists she can find Peter. However, she is pulled off the assignment, much to her frustration.|$|E
500|$|Thomas O'Leary, the {{wireless}} operator for ML 446, recalled {{the ferocity of}} incoming German fire, stating"One commando was remarking how pretty the tracer fire, red and green, was. A moment later one blew {{the back of his}} head out. I was down below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) and out the other side. If I wanted to get about I had to crawl on my hands and knees and I was lucky nothing came through at my level. We couldn't get in (to the objective) and all over a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire."ML 177, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the estuary. [...] ML 269, another torpedo-armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E
2500|$|Hilda Margaret McGruder (2104–2108) took command {{as she was}} {{the only}} {{surviving}} member of the Council of Five after the war. She proved to be an outstanding leader, overseeing the reconstruction {{of the city and the}} reformation of Justice Department. After four years she resigned [...] despite the entreaties of her colleagues [...] when she questioned her own judgement following her mishandling of a crisis. <b>On</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> she dismissed her supporters from the Council as they had shown flawed judgement.|$|E
50|$|Yoho and Inspector Robin {{turn out}} to be {{childhood}} friends. Inspector Robin repeats his reason for keeping Yoho locked up, however Yoho appears to be unconcerned and insists on leaving. To prevent him leaving, Inspector Robin imposes a $5000 bail. However to his surprise, a mysterious woman (Yiu Wai) arrives to promptly pay the $5000 bail money upfront. Although Yoho doesn't know the woman, he leaves with <b>her.</b> <b>On</b> the <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> they bump into Popeye who deliberately got arrested in order to kill Yoho in prison.|$|R
50|$|Returning home, Susan {{writes a}} letter to Nick {{breaking}} off their relationship, but the Martin address {{turns out to be}} unlisted. She therefore returns to the BBC and leaves the letter on his microphone; <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> back <b>out,</b> however, she mistakes the door and ends up locking herself in a supply closet. The next morning, she turns up missing; Nick, frantic, sets all of England looking for her, and at first refuses to broadcast until she's found. Being persuaded, however, that his program is necessary for the social stability of the nation, he returns to the BBC that evening; {{in the course of the}} broadcast, the closet door is opened, and Susan tumbles out, unconscious. She is, however, quickly revived - and, what is more, when she sees her guardians’ nephews (who have inadvertently locked themselves into, and then flooded, the mixing room), she bursts out laughing, thereby finally curing herself of the hiccups. She and Nick fall into each other's arms, and all ends happily.|$|R
50|$|Ryan {{meets with}} Agent Mendez who asks if Ryan has any ideas {{who in the}} FBI may be leaking {{information}} to Joe, suggesting she's finding it hard to trust anybody anymore. Ryan uses that idea against her, and walks out claiming he doesn't know if he can trust <b>her.</b> <b>On</b> his <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> he runs into Weston who says he is leaving to go home. Despite Ryan trying to make him stay, Weston has his mind made up, as he feels too mentally unstable to continue working on the case after lashing out on Luke. He tells Ryan that his dad won't talk {{to him because he}} doesn't understand Weston's instability.|$|R
2500|$|Her fourth marriage, from April 14, 1976 until 1981, was to Barry Comden (March 30, 1935– May 25, 2009), who {{was roughly}} a decade younger. Comden was the maître d'hôtel {{at one of}} Day's {{favorite}} restaurants. Knowing of her great love of dogs, Comden endeared himself to Day by giving her a bag of meat scraps and bones <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the restaurant. When this marriage unraveled, Comden complained that Day cared more for her [...] "animal friends" [...] than she did for him.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 August 1805, Calcutta, {{still under}} the command of Captain Woodriff, left St Helena as escort of a motley convoy to England. The convoy {{consisted}} of the East India company's [...] "extra-ship" [...] Indus, from Madras, the southern whaler African from Desolation, the whaler Fox from the Mozambique channel, the whaler Grand Sachem from the Peruvian coast and bound to Milford, the Prussian ship Wilhelmina, which Calcutta had detained <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> to St Helena, and the large Swedish ship Carolina, which was sailing from China and asked to join.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was largely}} unknown nationally until {{the eve of}} the U.S.-led Invasion of Iraq in 2003. <b>On</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of a meeting on February 26, 2003, in a media scrum Parrish was overheard on a boom mike saying, [...] "Damn Americans, I hate those bastards!" [...] She later told the media that her {{comments}} were directed towards George W. Bush and his administration and not the American people as a whole. Members of the opposition Canadian Alliance party called for her to be punished by then Liberal leader and Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, but no disciplinary action occurred.|$|E
50|$|Day 152: The Big Four was {{announced}} {{by having them}} step up on the circles. Divine's girlfriend greeted <b>her</b> <b>on</b> the <b>way</b> <b>out.</b> After Divine left, the quartet were given one last challenge - to safeguard 50 balls each while only remaining atop the platforms for 24 hours. The balls, which they picked {{up all over the}} Resort, would represent PHP50,000 (PHP1,000 a ball) for a chosen charity. Each of the quartet went to the confession room, where they called a loved one to express apologies. Paco called up his ex-girlfriend, Slater got in touch with his mother (who reportedly opposed him joining the show), while Biggel's father hung up on him as soon as he identified himself as the caller. Since Pamu could not reach her mother, Big Brother asked her to make a special message she would have said if they indeed talked.|$|R
50|$|At 1630, the tug {{reports to}} the Coast Guard at the {{entrance}} to Huntington Bay. At 1640, the tug again communicated with the Coast Guard station. This time the captain reported that the sea state was 6 to 8 feet. At this point, the Poling Bros. tanker passes <b>her</b> <b>on</b> their <b>way</b> <b>out</b> into the sound. Perhaps this causes Dickman to rethink his plan to make Northport. The bay would have been in a state of upheaval in the NW wind. If he attempted to make the turn past Sand City, and the boat strayed off course in the wind, perhaps the tug would touch bottom or ground on the passage into the inner harbor. The boat would have been {{at the mercy of the}} weather if that happened. Some captains, and rightly so, decide to weather storms at sea, rather than to be beaten to death against a pier or at a mooring.|$|R
50|$|Emma asks why Caleb was {{the only}} one to see his mother before she died. He reveals he was hurt by her cheating, and shut her out of his life. However, he {{eventually}} discovered that Donald had been the one cheating until his wife finally left, never thinking that he would refuse to let her see her sons. Caleb never told Peter because he was only 12. Emma tells Caleb she was a virgin. Caleb leaves and reminds Emma that Peter is in love with <b>her.</b> <b>On</b> his <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> he runs into his father who deduces what happened and says he’ll tell Peter. Caleb calls him a coward for erasing him out of his life; in the last 8 years, Donald never attempted to re-enter his life. They both hide quickly as Peter goes to Emma’s room, and Caleb dictates to Donald that he won’t tell Peter what he did, otherwise he’ll tell him Donald’s secrets and he’ll lose both his sons. Peter and Emma sleep together, and he loses his virginity to her.|$|R
2500|$|It is Kitty who {{pulls away}} and Laura is assailed by a panic. She feels {{she will be}} {{perceived}} as the predator in this astounding development, and indeed [...] "Laura and Kitty agree, silently, that this is true." [...] She also realizes her son, Richie, has been watching everything. However Kitty is already <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> the door, her momentary lapse of character wiped from memory. Nothing is mentioned of the kiss, she brushes off Laura's continued overtures of help politely, and leaves. Laura's world has been jolted. It is too much. It is like a Virginia Woolf novel, too full. Attempting {{to return to the}} world she knows, she attends to her son and, without hesitation, dumps her freshly made cake in the bin. She will make another cake, a better one.|$|E
2500|$|Tate {{appeared}} at the BBC's Comic Relief telethon in March 2005, {{in the guise of}} Lauren Cooper. In a section of the show, which features fans of McFly asking questions to the group, Lauren decides to ask, [...] "Why are you so rubbish?" [...] When told by Simon Amstell, who is hosting the segment, that only positive questions are allowed, Lauren uses a variety of her catchphrases, including [...] "Am I bovvered?" [...] and [...] "Are you calling me stupid?" [...] Lauren is then [...] "ordered" [...] to ask a more positive question to the group, and confuses them with Busted, asking, [...] "Are you gutted that Charlie left?" [...] When told to leave the set, <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> she asks Danny Jones from McFly to sign her knee, walking away promptly saying [...] "You can't even spell." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of {{his next}} five films, only The Misfits (1961), found {{critical}} approval. However, critics {{have noted the}} [...] "retrospective atmosphere of doom" [...] which now hangs over the film. Clark Gable, the star, {{died of a heart}} attack a few days after the filming was completed; Marilyn Monroe never did another film and died a year later; and costars Montgomery Clift and Thelma Ritter also died over the next few years. During the filming itself, Monroe was often on drugs of various kinds, which led to her arriving late on the set and often forgetting her lines. Monroe's problems also led to the breakup of her marriage to the film's scriptwriter, Arthur Miller, [...] "virtually on set." [...] Miller dramatized the making of The Misfits in his final play, Finishing the Picture, where Huston is represented as the director. Huston later commented about this period in her career: [...] "Marilyn was <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out.</b> Not only of the picture, but of life." ...|$|E
60|$|A man was {{standing}} at the studio door with a large dish into which each person as he went in dropped his half franc. The studio was much fuller {{than it had been in}} the morning, and there was not the preponderance of English and Americans; nor were women there in so large a proportion. Philip felt the assemblage was more the sort of thing he had expected. It was very warm, and the air quickly grew fetid. It was an old man who sat this time, with a vast gray beard, and Philip tried to put into practice the little he had learned in the morning; but he made a poor job of it; he realised that he could not draw nearly as well as he thought. He glanced enviously at one or two sketches of men who sat near him, and wondered whether he would ever be able to use the charcoal with that mastery. The hour passed quickly. Not wishing to press himself upon Miss Price he sat down at some distance from her, and at the end, as he passed <b>her</b> <b>on</b> his <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> she asked him brusquely how he had got on.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Kenton's {{difficulties}} in setting her husband right were indefinitely {{heightened by the}} suspicion that the most unsuspicious of men fell into concerning Breckon. Did Breckon suppose that the matter could be turned off in that way? he stupidly demanded; {{and when he was}} extricated from this error by his wife's representation that Breckon had not changed at all, but had never told Ellen that he wished to speak with him of anything but his returning to his society, Kenton still could not accept the fact. He would have contended that at least the other matter must have been in Breckon's mind; and when he was beaten from this position, and convinced that the meaning they had taken from Ellen's words had never been in any mind but their own, he fell into humiliation so abject that he could hide it only by the hauteur with which he carried himself towards Breckon when they met at dinner. He would scarcely speak to the young man; Ellen did not come to the table; Lottie and Boyne and their friend Mr. Pogis were dining with the Rasmiths, and Mrs. Kenton had to be, as she felt, cringingly kind to Breckon in explaining just the sort of temporary headache that kept her eldest daughter away. He was more than ordinarily sympathetic and polite, but he was manifestly bewildered by Kenton's behavior. He refused an hilarious invitation from Mrs. Rasmith, when he rose from table, to stop and have his coffee with <b>her</b> <b>on</b> his <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the saloon. His old adorer explained that she had ordered a small bottle of champagne in honor of its being the night before they were to get into Boulogne, and that he ought to sit down and help her keep the young people straight. Julia, she brokenly syllabled, with the gay beverage bubbling back into her throat, was not the least use; she was worse than any. Julia did not look it, in the demure regard which she bent upon her amusing mother, and Breckon persisted in refusing. He said he thought he might safely leave them to Boyne, and Mrs. Rasmith said into her handkerchief, [...] "Oh yes! Boyne!" [...] and pressed Boyne's sleeve with her knobbed and jewelled fingers.|$|R

2500|$|Having {{walked back}} home from Richard's, Clarissa Vaughan enters her apartment. Her partner Sally, a TV producer, is <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> {{the door to}} a lunch meeting with a film star. Suddenly, left alone, Clarissa feels unmoored. She feels as if her home and its comforts are trivial in light of the {{impending}} death of her closest friend Richard; compared to a time when she felt most alive and had everything to hope for. Her apartment is just as much a [...] "realm of the dead" [...] as Richard's. Like the other characters in Cunningham's novel she questions the value of her present life and whether it isn't a negation via triviality of the life she could lead. Then the feeling moves on. Clarissa is disappointed but relieved to find her life is her own and that she wants no other. She holds onto the prospect of preparing Richard's party as affirmation and begins arrangements.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{families}} finally meet for the eventual “pamamanhikan” at the palatial Fuentebella residence, what starts as a civilized encounter between two families escalates into a hilarious rich-versus-poor mano-a-mano where Tracy's grandfather (Jaime Fabregas) insulted the Polotan's family, {{a scenario that}} turns the mansion into a madhouse of outlandish proportions which resulted in Rock and Tracy's separation. Rock got depressed and did not leave his room for three days. [...] He was confronted by his mother Rose, saying that life must go on. Rose thinks her son is still young for fatherhood, so she is {{not in favor of}} the marriage. Nick thinks the family would be in shame if Tracy will raise a child with no father, so he wants the wedding to push through as soon as possible. Elaine, who also got pregnant at a young age does not want her daughter to experience a forced marriage and get trapped in a loveless marriage as {{what had happened to her}} and her husband, Nick. Elaine suggested that it would be better if Tracey would just go to the USA and give birth there, but before Tracy's departure, Rock was able to sneak into Tracy's room, and they elope. The two then sent an MMS to their families stating that they got married in the City hall. The two parties become so depressed because of Rock and Tracey's decision. Elaine seems to be disappointed with Nick. She thinks that Nick is not a good father to Tracy so their daughter grew up to be imperfect person. She decides to leave, but <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of the estate, Nick stops her and professes his undying love, stating that it would be best if they will try to start again. On the other hand, Rose and Pol also renew their love. Meanwhile, Brent (Coleta), Rock's best friend who is a closeted gay and is secretly in love with Rock, professes his love when they were drunk but the two remain best friends. In the end, the two families are able to accept the fate of Rock and Tracy who become parents at 19. The movie ends with the cast singing [...] "Pag-Ibig", and [...] "I Do Bidoo Bidoo".|$|E
2500|$|Jesse is an Australian {{resistance}} sailor and Derek Reese's love interest. In her timeline, she {{sailed to}} Australia to deliver supplies aboard the upgraded nuclear submarine , captained by a reprogrammed Terminator, Queeg, {{of which she}} is the executive officer. Queeg diverts the submarine {{to pick up a}} package and return it to John Connor. Her crew is curious of what is in the package so they open it. Inside is a T-1001 and one of the crew members, a woman, points her gun at it. The T-1001 kills her and takes her form, then shakes its finger at the rest of the crew. Queeg kills a crewman after he beat on Jesse. Jesse does not trust Queeg so she relieves him of command. Queeg does not obey her orders so she terminates him and destroys the submarine in an attempt to kill the T-1001. <b>On</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> she encounters the T-1001 and it tells her, [...] "the answer is no." [...] In 2007, she is on a possibly self-imposed mission to find and stop Cameron from adversely influencing young John, by recruiting Riley Dawson in the future and bringing her back to frame Cameron for her murder. In the future from which Jesse comes, John has withdrawn from humans and speaks only with Cameron. It is unclear whether this mission is self-appointed, but comments by her and the fact she was able to access the time travel machinery with Riley suggests others in the Resistance leadership group may share her concerns about Cameron's influence on John. John Connor later figures out that Jesse killed Riley and informs Derek, but orders her life to be spared. Derek confronts Jesse. He tells her that they are from two different futures and that he doesn't know who she is. He tells her, [...] "John Connor wanted to let you go. I'm not John Connor." [...] He pulls his gun on her and she takes off running. Whether or not Derek actually kills her is left ambiguous, although he does pull the trigger on his handgun. When asked about it by John he just says, [...] "John Connor wanted to let her go." [...] This could either mean that he obeyed John Connor's order or since he is not John Connor, he didn't want to let her go and he shot her. Later on in a flashback, Cameron is seen talking to Jesse. Cameron tells her that she is sorry for her loss. She says that the pressure from leaving the submarine killed her baby, she was pregnant with Derek's baby. Jesse tells Cameron, [...] "Tell John Connor it said [...] "The answer is no"" [...] Then, Jesse asks Cameron, [...] "If the answer is no, what was the question?" [...] Cameron answers with, [...] "Will you join us?" [...] Cameron tells Derek about the miscarriage and he says he never had any kids.|$|E
