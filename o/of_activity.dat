5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E

Although neither the NOAA nor Gray had ever forecast such high levels <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> even the midseason outlooks fell far short of the actual level <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> The actual ACE would prove to be 248 × 104 kt2— 277% of the median.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recognizing and {{supporting}} human activities {{is an important}} challenge for ambient assisted living. In this paper we introduce a novel argumentation-based approach for dealing with human activity recognition. By considering {{a model of the}} world and a set of observations of the world, hypothetical fragments <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> are built. The hypothetical fragments <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> will be goal-oriented actions and they will be considered defeasible. Therefore we consider extension-based argu-mentation semantics for local selection of hypothetical fragments <b>of</b> <b>activities.</b> By considering degrees <b>of</b> fulfillment <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> and local selection, a global selec-tion of hypothetical fragments <b>of</b> the <b>activities</b> is defined.

5|$|The Guianan cock-of-the-rock has {{distinctive}} territorial markings. Males {{usually take}} dominance {{of an area}} on the ground, although they sometimes they occupy middle strata in forests. They make their characteristic marking by clearing out debris from the ground, including twigs, leaves, and pellets. This area is called a “court”. Quality of courts {{are known to have}} some influence on mate choice. The court quality is determined by the territory density and location to the center <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> in the lek. The reason for the focus on the center <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> in the lek is that successful males tended to own courts in the most densely clustered lek areas.
