5|$|Despite the {{existing}} double track {{all the way}} from Oslo to Moss, a further upgrade southwards {{will not be able to}} increase capacity past the current single train per hour to Fredrikstad, Sarpsborg and Halden. The most optimistic plans involve finishing the first upgrades of track south <b>of</b> <b>Moss</b> simultaneously with the Follo Line. The Rail Administration and Ministry of Transport is working on proposals for a high-speed railway between Oslo and Gothenburg in Sweden. This line would most likely use the Follo Line for the initial distance from Oslo.|$|E
5|$|Warburton has {{a history}} of {{settlement}} stretching back to the 11th century, with the possibility of earlier habitation. There are 17 listed buildings in the village, including the timber framed GradeI Church of St Werburgh, which is at least 700 years old. Among the other listed buildings are examples of architect John Douglas' work, including the second Church of St Werburgh, built in 1883. In 2006, Time Team excavated in the lands <b>of</b> <b>Moss</b> Brow Farm in Warburton, looking for a Roman fortlet.|$|E
5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump <b>of</b> <b>moss,</b> and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E

5|$|H-13/FFH-13 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with US Highway2 (US2) west <b>of</b> <b>Moss</b> Lake. The roadway runs north crossing {{a line of}} the Canadian National Railway. It heads through the Hiawatha National Forest, running parallel to the Sturgeon River. H-13/FFH-13 crosses the river near the Flowing Well National Forest Campground on a T-beam bridge built in 1941. The road meanders from there northeasterly through rural Delta County forests, passing {{to the west of}} Dana and Skeels lakes and crossing several small streams. It crosses into the southeastern corner of Alger County near Straits Lake. The road continues northeasterly and then meanders back and forth along the Alger–Schoolcraft county line in an area dotted with several lakes.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, Bradford, Harpurhey, Rusholme {{and parts}} <b>of</b> <b>Moss</b> Side and Withington townships {{became part of}} the City of Manchester. In 1889, the city became a county borough as did many larger Lancashire towns, and {{therefore}} not governed by Lancashire County Council. Between 1890 and 1933, more areas were added to the city which had been administered by Lancashire County Council, including former villages such as Burnage, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Didsbury, Fallowfield, Levenshulme, Longsight, and Withington. In 1931, the Cheshire civil parishes of Baguley, Northenden and Northen Etchells from the south of the River Mersey were added. In 1974, by way of the Local Government Act 1972, the City of Manchester became a metropolitan district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. That year, Ringway, the town where the Manchester Airport is located, was added to the City.|$|E
5|$|Moss was {{the founder}} and {{director}} <b>of</b> <b>Moss</b> Electrical Co Ltd, and owned 950 of the 1,000 available shares. In September 1986 he said that Hunter, the finance director, could have 50 of these shares {{as part of his}} employment. Crucially, he made no statement or trust involving the other 900 shares. This gift of 50 shares was never implemented because of tax concerns, the risks of a takeover, and mainly because Moss changed his mind. Hunter brought a case against Moss claiming his 50 shares, which rested on two issues. First, whether the language used was sufficient to create a trust, and second, whether or not the trust failed to provide the three certainties {{because of the lack of}} segregation between the shares.|$|E

5|$|Solutions {{of copper}} {{compounds}} {{are used as}} a wood preservative, particularly in treating the original portion of structures during restoration of dry rot damage. Together with zinc, copper wires may be installed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth <b>of</b> <b>moss.</b> Textile fibers are blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics. Copper alloys are used in musical instruments, particularly: the body of brass instruments; circuitry for all those that are electronically amplified; the bodies of brass percussion such as gongs, bells, and kettle drums; tuning heads on guitars and other string instruments; string windings on harps, pianos, harpsichords, and string instruments; and the frame elements of pianos and harps. Copper is commonly used as a base on which other metals such as nickel are electroplated.|$|E

25|$|Many trees, shrubs, vines, {{ferns and}} other {{herbaceous}} perennials form clonal colonies naturally. Parts {{of an individual}} plant may become detached by fragmentation and grow on to become separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction <b>of</b> <b>moss</b> and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of gemmae. Some vascular plants e.g. dandelion and certain viviparous grasses also form seeds asexually, termed apomixis, resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.|$|E

25|$|There {{are ongoing}} and coming {{projects}} for high-speed upgrades on the closest 50–100km from Oslo {{on each of}} these lines (except direction Stockholm). They have good potential for regional trains. Upgrade and new construction to high-speed standard have to some extent already taken place like for Gardermobanen. The time plan is to have 200km/h or more from Oslo to Porsgrunn (partially slower), to Hamar and to Råde east <b>of</b> <b>Moss</b> around 2020-2025, and to Halden and Hønefoss later, maybe 2030.|$|E
25|$|Man-made EMI (electromagnetic interference) {{can also}} disrupt or jam GPS signals. In one {{well-documented}} {{case it was}} impossible to receive GPS signals in the entire harbor <b>of</b> <b>Moss</b> Landing, California due to unintentional jamming caused by malfunctioning TV antenna preamplifiers. Intentional jamming is also possible. Generally, stronger signals can interfere with GPS receivers when they are within radio range or line of sight. In 2002 a detailed description of how to build a short-range GPS L1 C/A jammer was published in the online magazine Phrack.|$|E
25|$|The bedeguar gall is {{surrounded}} by a dense mass of sticky branched filaments. This structure gives the appearance of a ball <b>of</b> <b>moss,</b> and its filaments are often brightly coloured, being at their best around September; starting off green and then passing through pink and crimson to reddish brown. A large specimen can be up to 10cm in width. The larvae develop and then over winter as pupae in the now brown and dry-looking structure, emerging in May. The unilarval chambers are set in a woody core which persists after the filaments have worn off.|$|E
