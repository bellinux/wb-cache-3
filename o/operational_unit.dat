5|$|No. 1 Squadron {{returned}} to Australia on 5March 1919, and was disbanded. In 1921, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) was {{established as a}} separate branch of the military, and on 1January 1922, the squadron was re-formed on paper. Its planned strength, approved by the Air Board in December 1921, was three officers and five airmen, operating four Airco DH.9s. Funding problems for the fledgling Air Force resulted in the disbandment on 1July of No.1 Squadron and other units established at the same time, their aircraft and personnel instead forming a single squadron of six flights {{under the control of}} No.1 Flying Training School (No.1 FTS) at Point Cook. No.1 Squadron was reactivated as an <b>operational</b> <b>unit</b> of the RAAF reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF), at Point Cook on 1July 1925. Its commanding officer was Flight Lieutenant Harry Cobby.|$|E
5|$|The United States Air Force's 102d Intelligence Wing (102 IW), of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, is a {{military}} intelligence unit located at Otis Air National Guard Base, Massachusetts. Its primary subordinate <b>operational</b> <b>unit</b> is the 101st Intelligence Squadron. According to the Air Force, {{the history of the}} 102d begins with the 318th Fighter Group, which was active during World War II. After the war, the 318th was inactivated, and eventually the 102d Fighter Wing was formed, which had a direct lineage link. In 1946, the 102d was activated at Logan International Airport where it stayed until 1968, when it moved to Otis Air Force Base. Beginning in 1946, the wing began regular patrols of the Northeastern United States which took place in conjunction with Air Force active duty units. In 1968, the 102d was moved to Otis, where it continued its regular patrols until 1973.|$|E

5|$|The {{exposition}} to Night Trap {{is presented}} to the player by Lt. Simms of the Sega Control Attack Team (S.C.A.T.) {{at the start of}} the game. He explains that the team was alerted to the disappearance of five teenage girls who were last seen at the Martin winery estate. The Martin family consists of Victor Martin, his wife Sheila, their children Jeff and Sarah, and cousin Tony. The missing girls were reportedly invited to stay for the night. Police questioned the Martin family, but they claimed the girls had left safely, and they refused to let the police search the property. The police then handed over the case to S.C.A.T., which investigated the house and discovered a series of traps, security cameras, and an <b>operational</b> <b>unit</b> in the basement to control the apparatus. The S.C.A.T. agents spliced an override cable onto the control system and connected it to a control panel in the back hallway of the house. The player is given the role of an internal S.C.A.T. operative charged with controlling the traps and cameras from this back hallway.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{ultimate}} {{aim was to}} help defeat the communist forces in the Soviet Union, the Corps was used almost exclusively to fight the Partisans in areas of occupied Yugoslavia, initially in a defensive role. At its maximum strength, it was composed of one cavalry regiment and four infantry regiments. Between the autumn of 1941 and the spring of 1944, the Corps was primarily responsible for protecting weapons factories, mines, roads, and railroads throughout occupied Serbia in accordance with priorities established by the German High Command. The Corps never operated as a unified force, the regiment being its largest <b>operational</b> <b>unit.</b> The regiments were later assigned to act as auxiliaries to German or Bulgarian occupying forces. During its existence, it was reinforced with younger émigrés and former Soviet prisoners-of-war (POW). Russian émigrés living in Bulgaria, the Axis puppet Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and Hungary also came to Belgrade to join the force. It was armed by the Germans with weapons captured from the Royal Yugoslav Army, and its command language was Russian. Throughout its existence it maintained {{good relations with the}} Nedić administration.|$|E
