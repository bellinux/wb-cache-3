During his time at Oxford, he lived in the same rooms in Jesus College as his grandfather had when he studied there. Charles remained uninfluenced by the Tractarians, and instead rediscovered his family Methodist affiliations in preference to the Anglicanism he had acquired from Lloyd. He returned to Bala and <b>opened</b> <b>a</b> <b>preparatory</b> school for Calvinistic ministers with his brother-in-law, Lewis Edwards, in 1837. In 1842, he became principal of Trevecca College, Brecknock and remained in position for 20 years, encouraging his students to obtain degrees from the University of London before returning to Wales to preach. Students however disliked his overbearing attitude. He left in 1863 after a dispute, causing the college to close for three years, and was appointed as the pastor of the church in Abercarn, Monmouthshire through the influence of Lord Llanover and his wife Lady Llanover.|$|R

At {{the request of the}} Scranton diocese and of Catholic {{families}} in the area, the Jesuits who had recently assumed ownership of the University of Scranton began preparations to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> college <b>preparatory</b> school in the Scranton area. Led by the University's President, the Very W. Coleman Nevils, the Jesuits renovated a building known as the “Annex” on the corner of Mulberry Street and Wyoming Avenue for the high school. The Annex, formerly the Dr. Charles E. Thomson Scranton Private Hospital, was acquired by Bishop William J. Hafey in 1941. Although he had intended for it to be used by the university to expand its facilities, the Second World War in Europe had caused the college’s enrollment to decline precipitously and made such expansions unnecessary. After renovations were completed, the high school was opened in 1944 for young Catholic men. The Annex served as the high school’s home until 1961 when the construction of an expressway necessitated a move to a new location. After making the Old Main Building of the University of Scranton its temporary home for two years, Prep moved to its permanent location, the former Women’s Institute Building of the International Correspondence Schools, at 1000 Wyoming Avenue.|$|R
