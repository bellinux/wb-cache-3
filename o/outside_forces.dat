5|$|Two {{months before}} the war's end, on 7 March 1945, when the Allied armies crossed the Rhine and entered German territory, Friedrich Kellner tried {{to explain why the}} German people {{themselves}} had not rebelled against Nazi rule, why it was necessary for <b>outside</b> <b>forces</b> to rid the Germans of the tyrannical government they themselves had voted into power.|$|E
5|$|When Sedna was discovered, its extreme orbit raised {{questions}} about its origin. Its perihelion is so distant (approximately 75 AU) that no currently observed mechanism can explain Sedna's eccentric distant orbit. It is {{too far from the}} planets to have been affected by the gravity of Neptune or the other giant planets and too bound to the Sun to be affected by <b>outside</b> <b>forces</b> such as the galactic tides. Hypotheses to explain its orbit include that it was affected by a passing star, that it was captured from another planetary system, or that it was tugged into its current position by a trans-Neptunian planet. The most obvious solution to determining Sedna's peculiar orbit would be to locate a number of objects in a similar region, whose various orbital configurations would provide an indication as to their history. If Sedna had been pulled into its orbit by a trans-Neptunian planet, any other objects found in its region would have a similar perihelion to Sedna (around 80 AU).|$|E

5000|$|Job and Bigger are {{parallel}} characters in {{their dealings with}} suffering. That further suggests the aptness of Wright's epigraph. Job suffered trials from an <b>outside</b> <b>force</b> {{that he could not}} control. Similar to Job, Bigger struggled with an <b>outside</b> <b>force</b> of the racial norms of society. The parallel is further strengthened by the freedom both characters display in their defiance.|$|R

25|$|During 1948, Amazing Stories ceased all {{publication}} of Shaver's stories. Palmer would later claim {{the magazine was}} pressured by sinister <b>outside</b> <b>forces</b> to make the change: science fiction fans would credit their boycott and letter-writing campaigns for the change. The magazine's owners said later that the Shaver Mystery had simply run its course and sales were decreasing.|$|E

Reflecting his {{introverted}} nature and {{need to deal with}} his crush on Kristen, David's stories tend to be less about malignant <b>outside</b> <b>forces,</b> and {{more to do with the}} evil of past events left unresolved, or the darkness inside normal people, and the consequences of not dealing with their actions. In season 3, he and his family moved away.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the issues}} that {{learning}} organizations were designed to address within institutions is fragmentation, competition and reactiveness. Fragmentation is described as breaking a problem into pieces. For example, each organization has an accounting department, finance, operations, IT and marketing. Competition occurs when employees are trying to do better or 'beat' others in an assignment instead of collaborating. Reactiveness occurs when an organization changes only in reaction to <b>outside</b> <b>forces,</b> rather than proactively initiating change.|$|E

The use of tàijíquán as a martial art is quite challenging and requires a great deal of training.|$|E
25|$|Following this period, Sunni–Shia strife {{has seen}} a major upturn, {{particularly}} in Iraq and Pakistan, leading to thousands of deaths. Among the explanations for the increase are conspiracies by <b>outside</b> <b>forces</b> to divide Muslims, the recent Islamic revival and increased religious purity and consequent takfir, upheaval, destruction and loss of power of Sunni caused by the US invasion of Iraq, and sectarianism generated by Arab regimes defending themselves against the mass uprisings of the Arab Spring.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Timur Shah, three of his sons, the {{governors}} of Kandahar, Herat and Kabul, contended for the succession.

Many of his half-brothers were imprisoned on their arrival in the capital for the purpose, ironically, of electing a new shah. The quarrels among Timur's descendants that through Afghanistan into turmoil also provided the pretext for the interventions of <b>outside</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Lebedev {{begins to}} theorize that the Zone is being {{disrupted}} by {{a dramatic increase}} in energy emissions, emanating from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant {{in the center of the}} Zone. The emissions are a sort of [...] "immune response" [...] to an <b>outside</b> <b>force</b> that the Zone perceives as a threat. Lebedev believes this <b>outside</b> <b>force</b> to be a group of Stalkers who are reportedly making an attempt to reach the center of the Zone, and have made it further than any other group of Stalkers before. Both Levedev and Chebekov fear that the Zone's reaction may cause untold destruction should the group succeed. Scar is asked to seek out this group and stop them at all costs.|$|R

25|$|Work {{locus of}} control {{can also be a}} {{contributing}} influence. An individual with an internal {{locus of control}} orientation believes that they have control over their destiny.

Individuals who see their lives as being controlled by <b>outside</b> <b>forces</b> demonstrate an external locus of control (Robbins, 2005). Kassing's (2001) study demonstrated that employees with an internal locus of control used articulated dissent whereas an employee with an external locus of control preferred to use latent dissent.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the events}} of the season two finale, Vincent and Catherine can finally expose their {{relationship}} to the world. Vincent and Catherine will be living as a couple, but the challenge this season will be whether they can keep <b>outside</b> <b>forces</b> from tearing them apart. Season three will have a stronger focus on family, with Heather Chandler being a more prominent character and the viewers being introduced to two of Catherine's aunts. The show's costume designer Catherine Ashton announced via Twitter that the third season will reportedly end with some closure and a big cliffhanger.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} having Tajikistan {{in this article}} is {{primarily}} because the government of the country itself, is - or is seen to be - the source of claimed persecution of Muslims. (As opposed to coming from <b>outside</b> <b>forces</b> or other religious groups.) This can make the reported issues open to bias by media and personal religious beliefs or preferences. In actual fact, the government - with the apparent approval of the people - is attempting to keep the government completely secular (full separation of Church and State) to avoid what they perceive as problems in other surrounding countries.|$|E

25|$|Messiria {{leaders had}} objected to {{demarcation}} {{provisions of the}} CPA which they claim {{have a negative impact}} upon Messiria access to grazing lands. These grievances fed into armed clashes in December 2007, which killed at least 75 people, and further violence in February and March 2008, resulting in numerous deaths and civilian displacement. These clashes were considered by analysts to represent a serious threat to the peace process and trigger a resumption of civil war. The Messiria were not believed to be directly controlled by Khartoum, however analysts pointed out that local disputes over resources are readily manipulated by <b>outside</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
25|$|Zechella began {{serving as}} {{president}} of Offshore Power Systems (OPS) in 1972 when plant construction began. OPS was a 1970 joint venture between Westinghouse and Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock, who had recently merged with Tenneco. Their goal was to build floating nuclear power plants from a facility at Jacksonville, Florida. The completed plants were to be towed by ocean tugboats to their permanent locations, then anchored and protected by a massive concrete breakwater composed of 18,000 dolosses, each weighing 80 tons, designed to withstand hurricanes, tornadoes, moderate earthquakes and collision by a loaded tanker. However, <b>outside</b> <b>forces</b> seemed to conspire against it. A combination of nuclear regulations and no license, questions {{about the safety of}} nuclear power, the 1973 oil crisis, the 1973–75 recession and escalating costs caused the failure of the endeavor. A frustrated Zechella left OPS and retired as a Westinghouse Vice President in 1980 after 27 years at the company. Offshore Power Systems finally shut down in 1984.|$|E
25|$|Though {{he was an}} {{accomplished}} orator and successful lawyer, Cicero believed his political career was his most important achievement. It was during his consulship that the second Catilinarian conspiracy attempted {{to overthrow the government}} through an attack on the city by <b>outside</b> <b>forces,</b> and Cicero suppressed the revolt by executing five conspirators without due process. During the chaotic latter half of the 1st century BC marked by civil wars and the dictatorship of Gaius Julius Caesar, Cicero championed a return to the traditional republican government. Following Julius Caesar's death, Cicero became an enemy of Mark Antony in the ensuing power struggle, attacking him in a series of speeches. Cicero was proscripted as an enemy of the state by the Second Triumvirate and consequently executed by soldiers operating on their behalf in 43 BC after having been intercepted during attempted flight from the Italian peninsula. His severed hands and head were then, as a final revenge of Mark Antony, displayed in the Roman Forum.|$|E

25|$|Giger {{conceived}} the Alien as being vaguely human but a human in full armor, protected from all <b>outside</b> <b>forces.</b> He mandated that the creature have no eyes, {{because he felt}} that it made them much more frightening if you could not tell {{they were looking at}} you. Giger also gave the Alien's mouth a second inner set of pharyngeal jaws located at the tip of a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed biomechanical, a fusion of the organic and the mechanic. His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old Rolls Royce car, rib bones and the vertebrae from a snake, molded with plasticine. The Alien's animatronic head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 Academy Award for Visual Effects for their design of the Alien.|$|E
25|$|Seth Kaplan (2011) {{argues that}} in {{contrast}} to southern Somalia and adjacent territories, Somaliland, the secessionist northwestern portion of Somalia, has built a more democratic mode of governance from the bottom up, with virtually no foreign assistance. Specifically, Kaplan suggests that Somaliland has the most democratic political system in the Horn of Africa {{because it has been}} largely insulated from the extremist elements in the rest of Somalia and has viable electoral and legislative systems as well as a robust private sector-dominated economy, unlike neighbouring authoritarian governments. He largely attributes this to Somaliland's integration of customary laws and tradition with modern state structures, which he indicates most post-colonial states in Africa and the Middle East have not had the opportunity to do. Kaplan asserts that this has facilitated cohesiveness and conferred greater governmental legitimacy in Somaliland, as has the territory's comparatively homogeneous population, relatively equitable income distribution, common fear of the south, and absence of interference by <b>outside</b> <b>forces,</b> which has obliged local politicians to observe a degree of accountability.|$|E
25|$|The unified {{kingdom of}} Denmark {{emerged in the}} 10th century as a {{proficient}} seafaring nation {{in the struggle for}} control of the Baltic Sea. Denmark, Sweden and Norway were ruled together under the Kalmar Union, established in 1397 and ending with Swedish secession in 1523. Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until <b>outside</b> <b>forces</b> dissolved the union in 1814. The union with Norway made it possible for Denmark to inherit the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several cessions of territory to Sweden. In the 19th century there was a surge of nationalist movements, which were defeated in the 1864 Second Schleswig War. Denmark remained neutral during World War I. In April 1940, a German invasion saw brief military skirmishes while the Danish resistance movement was active from 1943 until the German surrender in May 1945. An industrialised exporter of agricultural produce {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, Denmark introduced social and labour-market reforms in the early 20th century that created the basis for the present welfare state model with a highly developed mixed economy.|$|E
