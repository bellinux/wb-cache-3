In this paper, {{by analyzing the}} behavior of the effective potential for the particles and photons, we investigate the time-like and null geodesic structures in the space-time of Bardeen model. At the same time, all kinds of orbits, which are allowed according to the energy level corresponding to the effective potentials, are numerically simulated in detail. We find many-world bound orbits, two-world escape orbits and escape orbits in this spacetime. We also find that bound orbits precession directions are opposite and their precession velocities are different, the inner bound <b>orbits</b> <b>shift</b> along counter-clockwise with high velocity while the exterior bound <b>orbits</b> <b>shift</b> along clockwise with low velocity.

The study is placed within a well-known setting involving the Loewy and socle series of a group algebra over G. We prove new bounds on the dimensions of terms in such series. Asymptotic results {{on the size of}} <b>shift</b> <b>orbits</b> are also derived; for example, if C is an elementary abelian p-group, then almost all <b>shift</b> <b>orbits</b> in B 2 (G,C) are maximal-sized for large enough finite p-groups G of certain classes...|$|R
40|$|A {{new design}} {{principle}} of a nonscaling fixed field alternating gradient accelerator is proposed. It {{is based on}} optics that produce approximate scaling properties. A large field index k is chosen to squeeze the <b>orbit</b> <b>shift</b> {{as much as possible}} by setting the betatron oscillation frequency in the second stability region of Hill’s equation. Then, the lattice magnets and their alignment are simplified. To simplify the magnets, we expand the field profile of r^{k} into multipoles and keep only a few lower order terms. A rectangular-shaped magnet is assumed with lines of constant field parallel to the magnet axis. The lattice employs a triplet of rectangular magnets for focusing, which are parallel to one another to simplify alignment. These simplifications along with fringe fields introduce finite chromaticity and the fixed field alternating gradient accelerator is no longer a scaling one. However, the tune excursion of the whole ring can be within half an integer and we avoid the crossing of strong resonances...|$|R

Under further conditions, when the support is contained in only finitely many <b>shift</b> <b>orbits,</b> sums of transformations of this special kind account for all possibilities.

The simultaneous Bernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev reflection at all sinks will be called the shift functor, and we consider the <b>orbits</b> under this <b>shift</b> functor. Whereas {{the length of a}} regular module growths exponentially when we apply the shift functor repeatedly, the radius of such a module growths just linearly. To any regular <b>shift</b> <b>orbit,</b> we attach a positive integer r (the minimal radius of the sink modules in the orbit) and the path in T(n) which starts at the center p of the sink modules in the orbit and ends at the center q of the source modules in the orbit.

If the center path of a <b>shift</b> <b>orbit</b> has length b, then the orbit contains precisely b flow modules, the remaining modules are sink modules and source modules.

A joint JSC and ARC project was undertaken to examine these issues in flight controllers during MOD shiftwork operations. An initial operational test of procedures and measures was conducted during STS- 53 in Dec. 1992.

Tests of the module show good conservation of the invariants of motion and consistency between full orbit and guiding center solutions. A first application is presented where test electron confinement properties in a JET massive gas injection-triggered disruption simulation are investigated. It is found that electron populations initialised before the thermal quench (TQ) are typically not fully deconfined in spite of the global stochasticity of the magnetic field during the TQ. The fraction of "survivors" decreases from few tens down to a few tenths of percent as the electron energy varies from 1 keV to 10 MeV. The underlying mechanism for electron "survival" is the prompt reformation of closed magnetic surfaces at the plasma core and, to a smaller extent, the subsequent reappearance of a magnetic surface at the edge. It is also found that electrons are less deconfined at 10 MeV than at 1 MeV which appears consistent with a phase averaging effect due to <b>orbit</b> <b>shifts</b> at high energy...|$|R
