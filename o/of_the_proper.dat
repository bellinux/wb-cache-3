5|$|A form of {{the species}} found in Korea and Japan, A.hygrometricus var. koreanus, was named by V.J. Stanĕk in 1958; it was later (1976) {{published}} as a distinct species—A.koreanus—by Hanns Kreisel. As pointed out by Fangfuk and colleagues, clarification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> name for this taxon must await analysis of A.hygrometricus var. koreanus specimens from the type locality in North Korea.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with Du Cange, many earlier historians {{distinguished}} between two persons of this name, since the sources record that a minor noble named Constantine Angelos, from Philadelphia, married the fourth daughter of Alexios I Komnenos {{and received the}} title of pansebastohypertatos, whereas the Constantine Angelos, uncle of Manuel I and active during the latter's reign, is recorded in the sources as a sebastohypertatos. However, in 1961 Lucien Stiernon demonstrated that the two persons are in fact the same, with pansebastohypertatos being merely a rhetorical augmentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> title.|$|E
5|$|Many {{works of}} crime and horror have been set in the Peak. The Terror of Blue John Gap by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930) recounts terrible events at the Blue John mines, and Sherlock Holmes investigates the {{kidnapping}} of {{a child in the}} region in The Adventure of the Priory School. Many of the horror stories of local author Robert Murray Gilchrist (1878–1916) feature Peak settings. More recently, Stephen Booth has written a series of crime novels set in various real and imagined Peak locations, while In Pursuit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Proper</b> Sinner, an Inspector Lynley mystery by Elizabeth George, is set on the fictional Calder Moor.|$|E

Bruckner dedicated the work to Oddo Loidol, one of his students at the Vienna Conservatory. It was Bruckner's first motet composed in Vienna.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigators}} also {{requested that}} Fokker conduct {{a study of}} the effects of ice contamination and pilot technique on the F28 aircraft. The NTSB evaluated the data from the tests and found that the pilot initiated the rotation five knots earlier at 119 knots instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> rotation speed of 124 knots. The data from Fokker was correlated with the cockpit voice recording and confirmed that the first officer called a rotation speed of 113 knots but the captain did not rotate until 119 knots.
