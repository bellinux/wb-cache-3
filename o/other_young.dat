5|$|In 1986, {{the first}} local short feature film {{to be shot}} on video was released. Titled Ciyaar Mood ("It is not a Joke"), it was {{directed}} by the filmmaker Abdurrahman Yusuf Cartan. Several renowned independent theater productions were later transposed to video by Muxiyadiin Qaliif Cabdi and various <b>other</b> <b>young</b> Somali directors.|$|E
5|$|Troilus used to mock the foolishness of <b>other</b> <b>young</b> men's love affairs. But {{one day he}} sees Cressida in {{the temple}} of Athena and {{falls in love with}} her. She is a young widow and {{daughter}} of the priest Calchas who has defected to the Greek camp.|$|E
5|$|Adult hawksbill {{sea turtles}} are {{primarily}} found in tropical coral reefs. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges {{in and around}} these reefs throughout the day. As a highly migratory species, they inhabit {{a wide range of}} habitats, from the open ocean to lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries. Little is known about the habitat preferences of early life-stage E. imbricata; like <b>other</b> <b>young</b> sea turtles, they are assumed to be completely pelagic, remaining at sea until they mature.|$|E

5|$|Bramatyo {{cast his}} wife, Zaskia Adya Mecca, as Ahmad Dahlan's wife Siti Walidah— Mecca {{also served as}} casting director, in charge of auditioning the {{supporting}} cast. Before filming began, Mecca attempted to research the biographies of Dahlan and his wife, as she and the <b>other</b> <b>young</b> actors did not {{know much about the}} couple. However, she found such research difficult as the libraries did not have the information she needed.|$|E
5|$|Brown, {{along with}} several <b>other</b> <b>young</b> players at the club, then flourished under the {{guidance}} of new manager Tony Mowbray. He missed four months of the 2004–05 season due to an injury sustained against Celtic. He consequently played in only 23 matches, scoring just twice, including the second goal in a 3–1 win over Celtic at Celtic Park.|$|E
5|$|Laying {{takes place}} in September and October. A clutch {{of four or five}} white and {{slightly}} shiny eggs, measuring 30 x 24mm, is laid. The incubation period has been recorded as anywhere from 19 to 23 days, with the female performing this duty alone. Newly hatched chicks are covered with long white down, and are largely helpless (nidicolous). They leave the nest four to five weeks after hatching and join up with <b>other</b> <b>young</b> birds in flocks, though rely on their parents for food for another fortnight after fledging.|$|E

5|$|Nell's story {{alternates}} {{between the}} perspectives of Nell Golightly, a seventeen-year-old girl, and the poet Rupert Brooke. The novel begins as Nell's father dies while tending to the family's bee hives. Because she is the oldest child and her mother is long dead, Nell Golightly decides finds {{a job as a}} maid at The Orchard, a boarding house and tea room outside of Cambridge which caters to the students at the University there. There she, along with several <b>other</b> <b>young</b> women, serves guests and cleans the facilities. She also helps a local beekeeper tend his hives.|$|E
5|$|She {{moved to}} Los Angeles and quickly secured {{a role in}} Dawson's Creek. Williams said later that she thought she knew all she needed to know since age15. She said in 2011 that she chose {{emancipation}} as she was influenced by <b>other</b> <b>young</b> actors doing it. In 1997, unhappy with the roles they were being offered, Williams and several actor friends wrote a script entitled Blink. It was sold, but nothing happened with it.|$|E
5|$|The cluster {{contains}} many brown dwarfs, which are objects {{with less than}} about 8% of the Sun's mass, not heavy enough for nuclear fusion reactions to start in their cores and become proper stars. They may constitute up to 25% {{of the total population}} of the cluster, although they contribute less than 2% of the total mass. Astronomers have made great efforts to find and analyse brown dwarfs in the Pleiades and <b>other</b> <b>young</b> clusters, because they are still relatively bright and observable, while brown dwarfs in older clusters have faded and are much more difficult to study.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the remiges (and alulae) of nestling hoatzins is much delayed compared to the {{development of}} these feathers in <b>other</b> <b>young</b> birds, presumably because young hoatzins are equipped with claws on their first two digits. They use these small rounded hooks to grasp branches when clambering about in trees, and feathering on these digits would presumably interfere with that functionality. Most youngsters shed their claws sometime between their 70th and 100th day of life, but some retain them— though callused-over and unusable— into adulthood.|$|E
5|$|When Tecumseh's War broke out, Buffalo and {{a number}} of <b>other</b> <b>young</b> warriors from the La Pointe area {{abandoned}} the Midewiwin for a time to follow the teachings of the Shawnee prophet Tenskwatawa. While en route to Prophetstown to join the attack on the Americans, they were stopped by Michel Cadotte, the respected Métis fur trader from La Pointe. Cadotte convinced Buffalo and the others that it would be fruitless to fight the Americans.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Carey {{lived with}} her mother Patricia in a small {{apartment}} on Long Island, New York. They were poor and had to move several times as Patricia found different jobs. As a result, Carey frequently transferred into different schools, and {{at the age of}} seventeen, she moved into a small Manhattan studio with <b>other</b> <b>young</b> women to pursue a career in music. She had already begun working on her demo tape with Ben Margulies, a classmate at her school in Huntington, Long Island. During this period, she lived a lifestyle of poverty, often sharing a box of spaghetti with her five roommates and wearing torn shoes. She held several jobs, while juggling school, writing, and recording music.|$|E
5|$|Exile One, {{based in}} Guadeloupe, {{is a leading}} Dominican kadans group of the 1970s that was very {{influential}} {{in the development of}} caribbean music. The full-horn section kadans band Exile One led by Gordon Henderson was the first to introduce the newly arrived synthesizers to their music that <b>other</b> <b>young</b> cadence or compas bands from Dominica, Haiti (mini-jazz) and the French Antilles emulated in the 1970s. Exile One was the most promoted creole band of the Caribbean. The first to sign a production contract with major label Barclay Records. The first to export kadans music to the four corners of the globe: Japan, the Indian Ocean, Africa, North America, Europe, The Cape Verde islands.|$|E
5|$|Florentine {{court records}} of 1476 show that Leonardo and three <b>other</b> <b>young</b> men {{were charged with}} sodomy but acquitted; {{homosexual}} acts were illegal in Renaissance Florence. From that date until 1478 {{there is no record}} of his work or even of his whereabouts. In 1478, he left Verrocchio's studio and was no longer a resident at his father's house. One writer, called the Anonimo Gaddiano, claims that in 1480 Leonardo was living with the Medici and working in the Garden of the Piazza San Marco in Florence, a Neo-Platonic academy of artists, poets and philosophers that the Medici had established. In January 1478, he received an independent commission to paint an altarpiece for the Chapel of St. Bernard in the Palazzo Vecchio; in March 1481, he received a second independent commission for The Adoration of the Magi for the monks of San Donato a Scopeto. Neither commission was completed, the second being interrupted when Leonardo went to Milan.|$|E

5|$|Gerd Heidemann {{was born}} in Hamburg in 1931. During the rise of Hitler his parents {{remained}} apolitical, but Heidemann, like many <b>other</b> <b>young</b> boys, joined the Hitler Youth. After the war he trained as an electrician, and pursued an interest in photography. He began working in a photographic laboratory and became a freelance photographer for the Deutsche Presse-Agentur and Keystone news agencies, {{as well as some}} local Hamburg papers. He had his first work published in Stern in 1951 and four years later joined the paper as a full-time member of staff. From 1961 he covered wars and hostilities across Africa and the Middle East; he became obsessed with these conflicts and other stories on which he worked, such as the search for identity of the German writer B. Traven. Although he was an excellent researcher—his colleagues called him , the Bloodhound—he would not know when to stop investigating, which led to other writers having to finish off the stories from large quantities of notes.|$|E
5|$|Like many <b>other</b> <b>young</b> physicists, Rabi {{was closely}} {{following}} momentous events in Europe. He was astounded by the Stern–Gerlach experiment, which convinced {{him of the}} validity of quantum mechanics. With Ralph Kronig, Francis Bitter, Mark Zemansky and others, he set out to extend the Schrödinger equation to symmetric top molecules and find the energy states of such a mechanical system. The problem was that none of them could solve the resulting equation, a second-order partial differential equation. Rabi found the answer in a book by the 19th-century mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. The equation had the form of a hypergeometric equation to which Jacobi had found a solution. Kronig and Rabi wrote up their result and sent it to Physical Review, which published it in 1927.|$|E
5|$|Lohan {{visits the}} Sanlaap centre, a women's and children's shelter in Kolkata. The centre offers dance therapy {{as part of}} their {{treatment}} and a group of girls perform a dance they have rehearsed. She talks to girls who had been held at a brothel and they describe being raped and drugged. The director of the Sanlaap centre describes how Lohan taking an interest in trafficking might inspire <b>other</b> <b>young</b> people to get involved in counteracting exploitation. Bharti Ali, director of the Non-governmental organization Centre for Child Rights, criticizes the government for not prioritizing child protection. Returning home, Lohan and the film crew are chased by paparazzi photographers at the airport. Two months later, Lohan is in London, England talking to Kate Redman, from Save the Children UK, who describes how one of the issues with government intervention is that only sex and drug trafficking is illegal. She also advocates raising awareness of the issues with trafficking.|$|E
