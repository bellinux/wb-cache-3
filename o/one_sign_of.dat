5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. <b>One</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the success of the above efforts {{is the fact that the}} Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health. The first two major measures were implemented by the government of Geir H. Haarde but also carried out by the government of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step to apply for EU membership.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. <b>One</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E

25|$|Choline {{deficiency}} {{may play}} a role in liver disease, atherosclerosis, and possibly neurological disorders. <b>One</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> choline deficiency is an elevated level of the liver enzyme ALT. If low choline intake causes an elevated homocysteine level, it raises the risk for preeclampsia, premature birth, and very low birth weight.|$|E
25|$|More precisely, William Rowan Hamilton {{put forth}} the quaternions and biquaternions; James Cockle {{presented}} tessarines and coquaternions; and William Kingdon Clifford was an enthusiast of split-biquaternions, {{which he called}} algebraic motors. These noncommutative algebras, and the non-associative Lie algebras, were studied within universal algebra before the subject was divided into particular mathematical structure types. <b>One</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> re-organization {{was the use of}} direct sums to describe algebraic structure.|$|E

25|$|Conditions {{that call}} for colonoscopies include {{gastrointestinal}} hemorrhage, unexplained changes in bowel habit and suspicion of malignancy. Colonoscopies are often used to diagnose colon cancer, but are also frequently used to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease. In older patients (sometimes even younger ones) an unexplained drop in hematocrit (<b>one</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> anemia) {{is an indication that}} calls for a colonoscopy, usually along with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), even if no obvious blood has been seen in the stool (feces).|$|E
25|$|The USSR's {{invasion}} of Afghanistan was only <b>one</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> insecurity in the region, also marked by increased American weapons sales, technology, and outright military presence. Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both {{external and internal}} threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's.|$|E
25|$|The {{bodies of}} water for salmon habitat must be clean and oxygenated. <b>One</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> high {{productivity}} and growth rate in the oceans {{is the level of}} algae. Increased algal levels lead to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the water, which transfers into living organisms, fostering underwater plants and small organisms, which salmon eat. Algae can filter high levels of toxins and pollutants. Thus, it is essential for algae and other water-filtering agents to not be destroyed in the oceans because they contribute to the well-being of the food chain.|$|E

50|$|After more touring, {{the band}} {{got into the}} studio for the last time, {{creating}} in 1989 Let Them Say. In 1990, the band broke apart. Marshall went off to create the 'Modern Mandolin Quartet' (specializing in classical pieces arranged for mandolin) and recorded albums on Windham Hill. Anger, again with David Balakrishnan, formed the Turtle Island String Quartet in 1985 and left to pursue that group full-time. Manring released a few solo albums on Windham Hill, and Higbie released <b>one</b> (<b>Signs</b> <b>of</b> Life).|$|R

25|$|Injuries to the genital {{areas can}} be swelling, lacerations, and bruising. Common genital {{injuries}} are anal injury, labial abrasions, hymenal bruising, tears of the posterior fourchette and fossa. Genital injuries are {{more prevalent in}} post-menopausal women and prepubescent girls. Internal injuries to the cervix and vagina can be visualized using colposcopy. Using colposcopy has increased the detection of internal trauma from six percent to fifty-three percent. Genital injuries to {{children who have been}} raped or sexually assaulted differ in that the abuse may be on-going or it happened in the past after the injuries heal. Scarring is <b>one</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the sexual abuse of children.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the primary}} sources of the new king's power was the wealth derived from the gold mines of eastern and {{northern}} Hungary. Production eventually reached the remarkable figure of 3,000lb. (1350kg) of gold annually – one-third of the total production {{of the world as}} then known, and five times as much as that of any other European state. Charles also sealed an alliance with the Polish king Casimir the Great. After Italy, Hungary was the first European country in which the Renaissance appeared. <b>One</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> its progressiveness was the establishment of a printing press in Buda in 1472 by András Hess, one of the earliest outside of the German lands.|$|E
25|$|Assad's {{government}} {{tried to}} decrease population growth, but this was only marginally successful. <b>One</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> economic stagnation was Syria's lack of progress in talks with the EU on an agreement. The main cause of this failure was the country's difficulty in meeting EU demands to open the economy and introduce reforms. Marc Pierini, head of the EU delegation in Damascus, {{said that if the}} Syrian economy was not modernised it would not benefit from closer ties to the EU. Assad's government gave civil servants a 20-percent pay raise on the anniversary of the corrective movement that brought him to power. Although the foreign press criticised Syria's reluctance to liberalize its economy, Assad's government refused to modernize the bank system, permit private banks and open a stock exchange.|$|E

[...] The decline of cities and civic life in the 4th century, when the wealthy classes were unable or disinclined to support public works, was <b>one</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the Empire's imminent dissolution.|$|E
500|$|Much {{critical}} commentary about Tzara {{surrounds the}} measure {{to which the}} poet identified with the national cultures which he represented. Paul Cernat notes that the association between Samyro and the Jancos, who were Jews, and their ethnic Romanian colleagues, was <b>one</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> a cultural dialogue, in which [...] "the openness of Romanian environments toward artistic modernity" [...] was stimulated by [...] "young emancipated Jewish writers." [...] Salomon Schulman, a Swedish researcher of Yiddish literature, argues that the combined influence of Yiddish folklore and Hasidic philosophy shaped European modernism in general and Tzara's style in particular, while American poet Andrei Codrescu speaks of Tzara as one in a Balkan line of [...] "absurdist writing", which also includes the Romanians Urmuz, Eugène Ionesco and Emil Cioran. According to literary historian George Călinescu, Samyro's early poems deal with [...] "the voluptuousness over the strong scents of rural life, which is typical among Jews compressed into ghettos." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Sephardic {{population}} settled {{mainly in}} the major urban centers of the Ottoman Empire, which included Salonika. Unlike other major cities of the Empire, the Jews controlled trading in Salonica. Their economic power became {{so great that the}} shipping and businesses stopped on Saturday (Shabbat)—the Jewish sabbath. They traded {{with the rest of the}} Ottoman Empire, and the countries of Latin Venice and Genoa, and with all the Jewish communities scattered throughout the Mediterranean. <b>One</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the influence of Salonikan Jews on trading is in the 1556 boycott of the port of Ancona, Papal States, in response to the auto-da-fé issued by [...] Paul IV against 25 marranoes.|$|E
2500|$|Harvey cites Wynford's {{southwest}} {{tower of}} Wells Cathedral as [...] "the {{source of the}} typical 'Somerset Tower'...and the later concept of the spireless tower throughout this country."

Ultimately, however, Harvey concludes that what is needed to do a proper dating and sorting of the rich collection of medieval towers in Somerset is a team of history, document, and architecture experts to probe widely and deeply, amassing all the clues possible before constructing the definitive dating and systematics of the towers.|$|E
