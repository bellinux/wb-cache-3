25|$|Simulated {{annealing}} (SA) is {{a related}} global <b>optimization</b> <b>technique</b> which traverses the search space by generating neighboring solutions {{of the current}} solution. A superior neighbor is always accepted. An inferior neighbor is accepted probabilistically based on the difference in quality and a temperature parameter.

25|$|The {{critical}} {{points of}} Lagrangians occur at saddle points, {{rather than at}} local maxima (or minima). Unfortunately, many numerical optimization techniques, such as hill climbing, gradient descent, some of the quasi-Newton methods, among others, are designed to find local maxima (or minima) and not saddle points. For this reason, one must either modify the formulation to ensure that it's a minimization problem (for example, by extremizing {{the square of the}} gradient of the Lagrangian as below), or else use an <b>optimization</b> <b>technique</b> that finds stationary points (such as Newton's method without an extremum seeking line search) and not necessarily extrema.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a survey {{on the application}} of heuristic <b>optimization</b> <b>techniques</b> in the broad field of finance. Heuristic algorithms have been extensively used to tackle complex financial problems, which traditional <b>optimization</b> <b>techniques</b> cannot efficiently solve. Heuristic <b>optimization</b> <b>techniques</b> are suitable for non-linear and non-convex multi-objective optimization problems. Due to their stochastic features {{and their ability to}} iteratively update candidate solutions, heuristics can explore the entire search space and reliably approximate the global optimum. This overview reviews the main heuristic strategies and their application to portfolio selection, model estimation, model selection and financial clustering. finance, heuristic <b>optimization</b> <b>techniques,</b> portfolio management, model selection, model estimation, clustering...|$|R

Second, we describe a class of <b>optimization</b> <b>techniques</b> applicable to the deployment of component-based DRE systems. Third, we describe the Physical Assembly Mapper (PAM), which is a model-driven optimization tool that implements these techniques to reduce footprint.

Our results indicate that the deployment-time <b>optimization</b> <b>techniques</b> in PAM provides significant benefits, such as 45 % improvement in footprint, when compared to conventional component middleware technologies...|$|R

The model was tested by using data pertaining to the early design parameters and unit cost of the structural system of 29 residential building projects.
