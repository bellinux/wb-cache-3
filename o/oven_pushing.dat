This system uses Siemens PLC on the mobile coke oven machines to send real-time data via wireless modems to fixed bases PLC. The data from the fixed base PLC is send to a computer system. This paper will Provided the reader with reasons why the customer applied wireless communications in this harsh industrial environment. The coke oven plant on a steel works has not, in the past, been regarded as a prime user of modern instrument technology. The reason for this perception {{may be due to the}} fact that the basic design of the coke battery has been changed little over the years. The recording and analysis of <b>oven</b> <b>pushing</b> force on a routine basis is seen as a means of monitoring plant operation. A torque sensor is set up at the shaft of the rotor for measuring pushing force. One of the most important features of this work is that it allows problems in the ovens to be identified at an early stage and for corrective action to be taken before it may develop into a refusal to push. The mechanical loads imposed on the battery structure can be maintained are necessary minimum controlled by the coal blending design, so helping to prolong its service life...|$|E

I took it into the outhouse, again shifted the cupboard, and {{plastered}} over {{the mouth of the}} <b>oven</b> behind. Simply <b>pushing</b> the cupboard back into its place, I waited for the next night that I might bury the body, though upon the whole it was in a tolerably safe hiding-place.|$|R
50|$|Chucky and Tiffany {{reveal their}} plan, and direct Jesse {{to steal a}} mobile home {{to use as a}} new vehicle to evade the police. While Tiffany prepares Jade for the body-switch, Jade convinces her to turn on Chucky. A fight between Tiffany and Chucky ensues. Jade locks Tiffany into an <b>oven,</b> while Jesse <b>pushes</b> Chucky out the window. Chucky shoots at Jesse, causing the mobile home to run off the road and into a ditch. Chucky forces Jade at gunpoint to take him to his grave site, while Jesse takes Tiffany and follows them. Chucky orders Jade to open the casket and take the amulet, which she does. Jesse then appears with Tiffany and they trade hostages, but Chucky throws a knife into Jesse's back, and ties up the couple for the ritual.|$|R
5000|$|The {{prepared}} coal {{charge in the}} coal tower is drawn by a charging car {{on the top of}} the batteries and charged into the ovens as per sequence. The charged coal is gradually heated by the heating wall of the oven in the absence of air to attain a temperature of 1000°-1050 °C at the central axis of the coke mass toward the end of coking period. the coking period is generally specified between 16 hrs and 19 hrs depending on oven condition and production requirement. the volatile matter of coal liberated during carbonization is collected in gas collecting mains in the form of raw coke oven gas passing through stand pipes and direct contact cooling with ammonia liquor spray. The gas cooled from 800 °C is drawn to coal chemical plant by exhauster. The residual coke is pushed out of the <b>oven</b> by <b>pusher</b> car through a guide into coke bucket. The red hot coke is taken to coke dry cooling plant for cooling.There are 4 batteries, each having 67 ovens each. Each oven can hold 32 tons of dry coal charge. The volumetric capacity of each oven is 41.6 cum the heat for carbonation is supplied by under firing of coke oven gas having CV of 4200 Kcal/Nm3 of mixture of BF gas & CO gas having 900 Kcal/Nm3. The heating system of batteries is of under jet, compound type having twin-heating flues with re-circulation of waste gases.its ...|$|R
