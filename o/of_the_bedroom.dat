5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} {{telephones}} {{at the farm}} on the night, {{all on the same}} landline. There was usually a cordless phone with a memory-recall feature in the kitchen; a beige digital phone, also kept in the kitchen; and a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom. (There was normally a fourth phone too, a blue digital phone in the first-floor office, but it had been sent for repairs on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and into the kitchen, where the police found it after the murders with its receiver off the hook. They found the beige digital phone under a pile of magazines in the kitchen.|$|E

25|$|The plots {{occasionally}} are {{intricate and}} always farcical, involving coincidences, misunderstandings, cross-purposes and meetings both missed and accidental. The innuendo <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> farce is sometimes present (often to the disgust of the socially conservative Basil) {{but it is}} his eccentricity, not his lust, that drives the plots. The events test {{to the breaking point}} what little patience Basil has, sometimes causing him to have a near breakdown {{by the end of the}} episode.|$|E
25|$|The police {{officers}} {{arrive at the}} house {{about a half hour}} later and discover Micah's body as well. They call to Katie, who wakes from her catatonic state and seems confused. Katie comes out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> with the knife still in her hand, the police ask her to drop the knife. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind one of the police officer slams shut, causing the officer to shoot Katie, killing her. The film ends with a police investigate the area and find nothing but the camera, still running.|$|E

25|$|Poirot {{does indeed}} get {{permission}} for an exhumation {{and the body}} is proved to be riddled with arsenic. Nurse Harrison is shocked and tells Poirot a new story of seeing Jean filling up a make-up compact with a powder from the dispensary. Poirot alerts the police who find such a compact in the bureau <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> of Jean's lodgings. They show it to Nurse Harrison who excitedly confirms {{that is the one}} she saw – only for Poirot to tell her that such compacts have only been manufactured for three months. Further, his valet, George, followed her some days previously, witnessing her purchase of a compact at Woolworths and then seeing her travel to Jean's lodgings to secrete it there. Trapped and broken, Nurse Harrison admits the murder.|$|E
25|$|The {{events of}} the seventeenth night have psychologically terrified the couple, {{which in turn has}} {{strengthened}} the demon. Over the next few nights, the paranormal activity is excessive and intense. They eventually call Dr. Fredrichs back to the house, but he is overwhelmed by the demonic energy upon entering. He apologetically leaves despite their pleas, stating that his presence only makes the demon angrier. The bleak reality causes the couple to lose all hope, which makes the demon strong {{enough to be able to}} pull Katie out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and bite her, causing her to become fully possessed. Micah discovers the bite mark and deciding events are too out of control to remain in the house, he packs to head to a motel. Just as they are set to leave, the possessed Katie insists they will be okay now.|$|E
25|$|Poirot and {{the police}} {{question}} the suspects and examine alibis. Kenneth was heard typing letters specifically responding to figures in previous mail. Linda falsely claims she was fond of her stepmother. By her watch, she and Christine went to Gull Cove at 10:30 and returned at 11:45, giving them an alibi. The Gardeners were with Poirot the entire time. Rosamund was seen reading at Sunny Ledge (above Pixy Cove) by Emily and Patrick. Rev. Lane and Major Barry were absent the whole day and Sir Horace Blatt went sailing. Christine, Rosamund, Kenneth and Mr Gardener all went to play tennis at noon. Earlier in the day, Miss Brewster was nearly hit on the head by an empty bottle tossed from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> windows, so Poirot asks the chambermaid if she has observed a bottle missing.

50|$|A broad {{flight of}} stairs led to <b>the</b> {{entrance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mansion. There was a large and very lofty hall, which was similar to Leinster House in Dublin. The hall contained plaques and oil portraits. To the right on entering was the library. The drawing room had a southern aspect, and contained several portraits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rowley family. The state dining room was detached from the main block and had beautifully covered ceilings. The grand stairs led to <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms.</b> <b>The</b> handsome mantle in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> was formally in a Dublin mansion.|$|R
25|$|While Sykes and Haytham {{watch the}} {{entrance}} to the complex, al-Ghazi, Fleury, and Mayes follow a blood trail and kill many gunmen inside. Mayes, separated from the others, finds Leavitt and his attackers, preparing an execution video of Leavitt. She kills the remaining insurgents, and al-Ghazi and the team start to leave. Fleury then realizes there is a trail of blood leading {{to the back of the}} apartment, and al-Ghazi sees the grandfather and inspects his hand. When the old man gives him his hand, al-Ghazi sees that the man is missing the same fingers as Abu Hamza al-Masri in the terrorist group's many videos and confirms his suspicion that the grandfather is the terrorist leader. Abu Hamza's teenage grandson walks out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and shoots al-Ghazi in the neck, then he starts to point his gun at Mayes, prompting Fleury to kill him. Abu Hamza then pulls out an assault rifle and Haytham kills him. As Abu Hamza dies, another grandchild hugs him and Abu Hamza whispers something into his ear to calm the child down. Al-Ghazi dies in Fleury's arms.|$|E
500|$|On 4 August 1985, {{three days}} before the murders, Sheila and the boys arrived at White House Farm to spend the week with June and Nevill. The {{housekeeper}} saw Sheila that day and noticed nothing unusual. Two farm workers, Julie and Leonard Foakes, saw her the following day with her children and said she seemed happy.

Entering the room, she found two-and-a-half-year-old Danna on the bed next to her father. Danna was holding one of James's guns, a [...]22 caliber Hi-Standard semi-automatic target pistol, and James was bleeding from an apparent gunshot wound {{in the back of his}} head. Kinne called the police, but James Kinne was dead by the time the ambulance carrying him arrived at the hospital.|$|E

The entire middle section is built about half a meter higher than the front section and back section, the difference in elevation is clearly visible from <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> functions as a ceremonial nuptial chamber, where daughters and their husbands will reside during <b>the</b> first years <b>of</b> their marriage.

The two began arguing heatedly in the bedroom, during which Stompanato threatened to kill Turner, her daughter, and her mother. Fearing that her mother's life was in danger, Turner's fourteen-year-old daughter, Cheryl, grabbed a kitchen knife and ran to Turner's defense. According to testimony provided by Turner at the coroner's inquest, Cheryl, who had {{been listening to the}} couple's fight behind the closed door, stabbed Stompanato in the stomach when Turner attempted to usher him out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> [...] " [...] I thought [...] hit him in the stomach," [...] Turner testified in court.

500|$|Filming {{began in}} June 1990 and took eight weeks (a third {{less time than}} {{required}} by Miller's Crossing), and the estimated final budget for the movie was US$9 million. The Coens worked well with Deakins, and they easily translated their ideas for each scene onto film. [...] "There was only one moment we surprised him," [...] Joel Coen recalled later. An extended scene called for a tracking shot out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and into a sink drain [...] "plug hole" [...] in the adjacent bathroom {{as a symbol of}} sexual intercourse. [...] "The shot {{was a lot of fun}} and we had a great time working out how to do it," [...] Joel said. [...] "After that, every time we asked Roger to do something difficult, he would raise an eyebrow and say, 'Don't be having me track down any plug-holes now.'" ...|$|E
25|$|The {{house is}} first {{mentioned}} (as Broke House) in <b>the</b> reign <b>of</b> Elizabeth I in a grant dated 1589, {{but this was}} an earlier building, though some parts of it are incorporated in the present house.

Priya Elan of NME described the lyrics [...] "Suck my cockiness, [...] my persuasion" [...] as [...] "cringey", but complimented the song's compositional structure, writing that it provides a [...] "genuine elastic thrill, twisting into all sorts of jaw-dropping musical shapes". Randell Roberts of the Los Angeles Times described [...] "Cockiness (Love It)" [...] and another track from the album, [...] "Birthday Cake", as the [...] "breast and booty" [...] of Talk That Talk but noted that they failed to capture the raunchiness that they set out to achieve. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly also wrote that [...] "Cockiness (Love It)" [...] and [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] were the most provocative songs on the album, describing them as [...] "I-like-it-rough tracks", but criticized them for being album fillers designed to get the listener out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and on to the dance floor.|$|E
500|$|... "Birthday Cake" [...] {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Jayson Lipshutz of Billboard praised the interlude, writing [...] "We're all for birthday-themed naughtiness in pop music form, but only 78 seconds of 'Birthday Cake' {{is just not}} enough of a celebration!" [...] Lipshutz continued to compare the song's lyrical message to Jeremih's [...] "Birthday Sex". Sam Lansky of MTV Buzzworthy was complimentary of [...] "Birthday Cake", writing, [...] "The only misstep on the album – not because it's not amazing (it is!), but because it's only 78 seconds long. 'Birthday Cake' is more decadent Rihanna filth, this time courtesy of sensual R The-Dream. Have any Rihanna Navy members made an hour-long mix yet? We {{need to keep the}} bump 'n' grind going all night." [...] Pip Ellwood of Entertainment-Focus noted that [...] "Birthday Cake", along with [...] "Cockiness (Love It)", [...] "leave you under no misunderstanding that Rihanna is as sexual as she's ever been throughout her career."
