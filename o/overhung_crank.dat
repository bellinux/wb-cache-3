50|$|The drive {{between the}} {{crankshafts}} was unusual. Rather {{than the typical}} geared drive, as used by the Jumo, there was a triangular coupling rod frame, driven by an <b>overhung</b> <b>crank</b> {{on the end of}} each crankshaft. This frame in turn drove the flywheel and output shaft. The frame also drove the fuel injection pump, mounted in the top vee between the cylinders.|$|E
50|$|Between 1932 and 1935 Stuart {{produced}} the small (1/2 HP) type N engine, which had an <b>overhung</b> <b>crank.</b> This model {{seems to have}} been superseded by the type R 2-stroke engine, which was introduced in 1934 with a full width crank. The R2 being 84 cc, and the R3 having a larger bore size and hence 123 cc. These small engines were used for general utility, but also the R3M for pleasure boats, hire boats. The R3 was to continue in production until 1977.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{a return}} {{connecting}} rod to a shaft beneath the boiler with <b>overhung</b> <b>cranks</b> also avoided {{the need for an}} internal crank. For Stephenson's designs, this crank axle would also have carried the locomotive's weight, not being merely a crankshaft, and so this avoided a particularly difficult piece of forging work.|$|R
50|$|Trevithick's first {{high-pressure}} engines from 1801 onwards, {{including his}} locomotives, used the return connecting rod layout in both {{horizontal and vertical}} arrangements. The cylinders were embedded within the boiler, to avoid heat loss, and the short boiler also formed {{the frame of the}} engine. This made the return connecting rod a natural layout, with the crankshaft {{at the opposite end of}} the boiler from the crosshead. The paired connecting rods were relatively simple components, even though two were required. As they also allowed the crankshaft to use two simple <b>overhung</b> <b>cranks</b> on the ends of the shaft, rather than a complex forged crankshaft with an internal crank, this was also a valuable simplification.|$|R
