5|$|In May 1998, the United States enacted {{sanctions}} upon India {{as a part}} of {{the international}} response to a series of nuclear weapons tests by India. , these sanctions effectively grounded India's Sea Kings because India could not purchase any US-supplied spare parts for the fleet. Westland also complied with the sanctions by refusing to maintain any US-made components. A limited number of Sea Kings were kept operational by cannibalising other aircraft and the manufacture of some components by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). In December 2000, President Bill Clinton permitted a relaxation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctions.</b> In the late 2000s, HAL and AgustaWestland signed an agreement to jointly maintain and perform upgrades to India's fleet of Sea Kings.|$|E
5|$|The Zoios' clandestine {{transaction}} with Turp initially progressed well, {{but fell}} apart in March 1966, when Turp discovered he {{would actually be}} arming Rhodesia rather than Pakistan, reacted with alarm and informed the British government. The British Board of Trade tightened its control over arms transactions, and encouraged its NATO counterparts to do the same, while the Zoios {{turned their attention to}} Belgian, Italian and West German arms dealers. In October 1966, a huge consignment of army and air force equipment arrived in Rhodesia from the seaports of Mozambique, with many of the containers bearing metropolitan Portuguese markings. Prominent among the European weapons were FN FAL battle rifles from Belgium, which allowed an unofficial Rhodesian trade delegation to operate quietly in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctions.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Miami Hurricanes {{kept pace}} with the Hokies {{throughout}} the regular season, winning every conference game after their loss to Tech. After Miami won its {{final game of the}} season and tied the Hokies for the Big East football championship (the Big East had no tiebreaker at the time), it appeared that Virginia Tech would be passed over for a Bowl Alliance game in favor of the Hurricanes. Miami traditionally had a stronger football team and a wider following on television, making it more attractive to bowl-game officials. But Miami's bowl hopes evaporated after the NCAA announced Miami would be put under sanctions for recruiting rules violations. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctions</b> included a ban from bowl games, which Miami elected to take after the 1995 season instead of delaying until 1996. After the sanctions were announced, the only question for the Hokies was whether they would be bound for the Orange Bowl in Miami or the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. That question was resolved on December 3, 1995, when Bowl Alliance officials announced their selection of Virginia Tech and Texas for the Sugar Bowl.|$|E
3000|$|... 8 In some cases, UBII {{recipients}} appeal against <b>the</b> imposition <b>of</b> a <b>sanction.</b> Social courts {{then have}} to decide on <b>the</b> legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanction.</b> <b>The</b> average duration <b>of</b> litigations in these instances was 13.7 months in 2007 (see Statistisches Bundesamt 2009). This period is considerably longer than our observation period of six months after <b>the</b> (hypothetical) imposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanction.</b> Therefore, we do not expect that a potential appeal of sanctioned survey participant against the benefit cut affects his or her behavior in our observation window.

40|$|When {{legal and}} social norms {{regulate}} the same behavior, an act can trigger both legal and nonlegal sanctions.

In principle, courts should avoid overdeterring wrongdoers by deducting <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonlegal <b>sanction</b> from compensatory damages. In practice, instead <b>of</b> deducting <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonlegal <b>sanction</b> to other people, courts should deduct {{the burden on the}} wrongdoer.
