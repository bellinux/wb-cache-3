One cannot help feeling that the repugnance with which he was regarded by the Household was based mostly on snobbery and colour prejudice." [...] Victoria biographer Elizabeth Longford wrote, [...] "Abdul Karim stirred once more that same royal imagination which had magnified the virtues of John Brown... Nevertheless, [...] insinuated into her confidence an inferior person, while it increased the nation's dizzy infatuation with an inferior dream, the dream of Colonial Empire." ...|$|E
