5|$|The impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> rush on the Native {{peoples of}} the region was considerable.

In the longer term, however, especially the Hän people living in the Klondike region suffered from the environmental damage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> mining on the rivers and forests. Their population had already begun to decline after the discovery of gold along Fortymile River in the 1880s but dropped catastrophically after their move to the reserve, a result of the contaminated water supply and smallpox. The Hän found only few ways to benefit economically from the gold rush and their fishing and hunting grounds were largely destroyed; by 1904 they needed aid from the NWMP to prevent famine.|$|E
