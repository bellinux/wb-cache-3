There are also several multiplayer modes: independent minigames as well as extensions of the main single-player game.|$|E

5|$|Some {{animals such as}} many moths, mantises and grasshoppers, have a {{repertory}} {{of threatening}} or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots or patches of bright and contrasting colours, so as to scare <b>off</b> <b>or</b> momentarily distract a predator. This gives the prey animal an opportunity to escape. The behaviour is deimatic (startling) rather than aposematic as these insects are palatable to predators, so the warning colours are a bluff, not an honest signal.|$|E

5|$|According to {{generally}} accepted standards of respect, the national flag {{should never be}} dipped to any person or thing. Care {{should be taken to}} prevent the flag from touching the ground, floor or water beneath it. It should be also secured from being torn <b>off</b> <b>or</b> falling to the ground and it should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain, blizzard or very strong wind. The flag should never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors and then, burning.|$|E
5|$|Although many in NASA's Voyager {{program were}} {{supportive}} of the idea, there were concerns that taking a picture of Earth {{so close to the}} Sun risked damaging the spacecraft's imaging system irreparably. It was not until 1989 that Sagan's idea was put into practice, but then instrument calibrations delayed the operation further, and the personnel who devised and transmitted the radio commands to Voyager 1 were also being laid <b>off</b> <b>or</b> transferred to other projects. Finally, NASA Administrator Richard Truly interceded to ensure that the photograph was taken.|$|E
5|$|As {{an active}} civil airfield, {{operations}} at Duxford are {{regulated by the}} Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In 2002 a privately operated Aero L-39 Albatros suffered a braking failure on landing, overran the runway and {{came to rest on}} the M11 motorway, a student pilot being killed after ejecting at ground level. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking <b>off</b> <b>or</b> landing towards the M11. As a result, the CAA and Duxford agreed to a reduction in the runway's 1500m declared length, from 1350m to 1200m, in order to provide a greater margin of error.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, there were over 850 monasteries, nunneries and friaries in England. By 1541, there were none. More than 15,000 monks and nuns had been {{dispersed}} and the buildings had been seized by the Crown to be sold <b>off</b> <b>or</b> leased to new lay occupiers. Glastonbury Abbey was reviewed as having significant amounts of silver and gold as well as its attached lands. In September 1539, the abbey was visited by Richard Layton, Richard Pollard and Thomas Moyle, who arrived there without warning on the orders of Thomas Cromwell. The abbey was stripped of its valuables and Abbot Richard Whiting (Whyting), who had been a signatory to the Act of Supremacy that made Henry VIII the head of the church, resisted and was hanged, drawn and quartered as a traitor on Glastonbury Tor on 15 November 1539.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in California, Hershberger {{attended}} Fullerton Union High School {{where he was a}} baseball standout. He was signed by the New York Yankees and was part of their minor league system for eight years. He was traded after the 1937 season to the Cincinnati Reds, where he found a place on the major league roster as a backup behind Ernie Lombardi. For three seasons, Hershberger played in relief of Lombardi, stepping in if he needed a day <b>off</b> <b>or</b> was injured. After a slump in late July and early August, Hershberger committed suicide on August 3, 1940 in his hotel room; the Reds {{went on to win the}} 1940 World Series in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Bute died in 1900 and his widow, the Marchioness, {{was given}} a life {{interest}} in Castell Coch; during her mourning, she and her daughter, Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, occupied the castle and made occasional visits thereafter. Production in the castle vineyards ceased during the First World War due to the shortages of the sugar needed for the fermentation process, and in 1920 the vineyards were uprooted. John, the 4th Marquess, acquired the castle in 1932 but made little use of it. He also began to reduce the family's investments in South Wales. The coal trade had declined after 1918 and industry had suffered during the depression of the 1920s; by 1938, {{the great majority of}} the family interests, including the coal mines and docks, had been sold <b>off</b> <b>or</b> nationalised.|$|E

5|$|By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes were invading Italy {{from the}} north as their culture {{expanded}} throughout Europe. The Romans were alerted to this when a particularly warlike tribe, the Senones, invaded two Etruscan towns close to Rome's sphere of influence. These towns, overwhelmed by the enemy's numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. The Romans met the Gauls in pitched battle at the Battle of Allia River around 390–387 BC. The Gauls, led by the chieftain Brennus, defeated the Roman army of approximately 15,000 troops, pursued the fleeing Romans back to Rome, and sacked the city before being either driven <b>off</b> <b>or</b> bought off. The Romans and Gauls continued to war intermittently in Italy {{for more than two}} centuries.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, the priory was in decline, but its closure came as {{a result}} of the {{dissolution}} of the monasteries in England and Wales under Henry VIII. To help speed the process of closing the institution, Ralf Hartley was appointed as the prior of Wetheral by Henry's minister, Thomas Cromwell; royal commissioners visited in 1536, and the priory was finally surrendered to the Crown in 1538. The priory's belongings were sold <b>off</b> <b>or</b> taken by Henry, depending on their value, but the lands were given to Carlisle Cathedral. Although the rest of the priory soon fell into disrepair, the gatehouse became the local vicarage; it was still intact and in use by the minister in 1687.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{assessments}} in the Philippines began on October31, with aerial surveys being utilized for isolated areas. With numerous roads blocked <b>off</b> <b>or</b> washed away, clearing operations were a priority. The Philippine Red Cross {{assisted in the}} immediate aftermath of Typhoon Cimaron, evacuating people in La Union and providing relief goods to more than 16,000people in Aurora. The majority of relief work was handled by local governments, though some assistance from the National Disaster Coordinating Council was received. By November1, the estimated cost of humanitarian assistance reached 3.2million PHP (US$81,000). Teams from the Red Cross were already deployed in the Philippines due to Typhoon Xangsane in September and were able to quickly respond in Cimaron's aftermath. Relief efforts for Cimaron were cut short as just two weeks later, Typhoon Chebi struck nearly the same areas. A weaker, though still powerful typhoon, damage from Chebi was relatively limited.|$|E

5|$|Harvey's {{departure}} at 294/5 {{brought the}} first of the bowlers, Johnson, to the crease. This did not deter Loxton, who was particularly severe on Laker, lifting the off spinner for four more sixes, two over the leg side followed by consecutive off drives into the gallery. On each occasion, umpire Chester walked {{to the edge of the}} playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester's actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Laker refused to be deterred by the aggressive batting and continued to bowl normally by pursuing defensive <b>off</b> <b>or</b> leg theory. Johnson scored 10 before falling with the score at 329/6, hitting Laker to Cranston.|$|E
5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow {{on the roof and}} freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls <b>off</b> <b>or</b> from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E
