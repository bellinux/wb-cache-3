5|$|Franklin {{writes that}} Oprah Winfrey's {{promotion}} <b>of</b> <b>Night</b> {{came at a}} difficult time for the genre of memoir, after a previous book-club author, James Frey, {{was found to have}} fabricated parts of his autobiography, A Million Little Pieces (2003). She argues that Winfrey's choice <b>of</b> <b>Night</b> may have been intended to restore the book club's credibility. Night has a useful lesson to teach, Franklin writes, about the complexities of memoir and memory.|$|E

It is one <b>of</b> the <b>nights</b> <b>of</b> the last ten days of Ramadan. Muslims believe that on this night the blessings and mercy of Allah are abundant, sins are forgiven, supplications are accepted, and that the annual decree is revealed to the angels who also descend to earth. Shia Islam holds that Prophets and the Shia Imams are recipients of the angels on the <b>night</b> <b>of</b> Qadr and the decrees that they reveal.|$|R

5|$|The {{removal of}} Kammhuber as {{commanding}} officer <b>of</b> <b>night</b> air defences in September 1943 {{did not prevent}} further appeals for the reinstatement of intruder operations. His replacement as General der Nachtjagd (General <b>of</b> <b>Night</b> Fighters), was Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) Joseph Schmid, commanding 1. Jagdkorps (1st Fighter Corps). Schmid had long argued for a repeat of intruder operations and first pressed for their resumption in December 1943. His proposals were rejected by Göring {{on the grounds that}} intruder operations were not his business. Schmid did not receive substantive support from other field commanders, most notably Hans-Jürgen Stumpff, who objected to the operation after meeting with Schmid in January and February 1944 on the grounds that Hitler opposed such operations and newer German radar was not to fall into Allied hands. Four months later, attitudes had not changed. Generalmajor Dietrich Peltz, commanding Angriffsführer England (Bomber Leader England) and IX. Fliegerkorps showed little interest in intruder missions either, since his remaining forces were engaged in night attacks against the Allied beachheads in Normandy. In October 1944, he finally won support from Werner Streib, Inspekteur der Nachtjagd (Inspector <b>of</b> <b>Night</b> Fighters) to press for an operation again. The plan was simple; a large force of 600—700 night fighters were to be gathered and sent out in one simultaneous operation.|$|E

5|$|Dust {{kicked up}} by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the {{darkness}} <b>of</b> <b>night</b> are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly {{the sound of an}} approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.|$|E

50|$|Leszek Hadrian {{the head}} of Musical Theater in Lublin {{was the first one}} to come up with the idea <b>of</b> the <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Culture. He claimed it to be a 'demonstration of culture'.

To date, many of the artistic and community centres in the city have joined the <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Culture. <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Culture should not be mistaken for the Long <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Museums. The <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Museums is a separate event which takes place in many different cities in Poland, whereas the <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Culture is unique and takes place only in Lublin. Both events are held on various dates.|$|R

He was appointed Rear Admiral (Destroyers) in the Mediterranean in December 1933 and was made a Companion of the Bath in 1934. Having hoisted his flag in the light cruiser HMS Coventry, Cunningham used his time to practice fleet handling {{for which he was}} to receive much praise in the Second World War.

The pens were {{priority}} targets as the torpedo boats they protected were a considerable threat to the supply lines serving Allied forces in western Europe.

5|$|The {{content is}} divided into 14 chapters. The first chapter serves as an {{introduction}} and considers the mythological and geological origin <b>of</b> <b>night.</b> The next 12 chapters are each titled after an hour starting with chapter 2's 6 pm and ending with chapter 13's 5 am. Chapter 2 discusses the transition into night, including sunsets, the green flash, the stages of twilight, as well as Olbers' paradox, and a definition of the size and speed <b>of</b> <b>night.</b> The 7 pm chapter deals with nature at night, how animals see and hear differently at night {{with a focus on}} bats, nighthawks, and nocturnal insects. The 8 pm chapter analyzes children's literature and bedtime stories. The 9 pm chapter discusses aspects of the city at night, including the evolution of nightclubs, street lights, and the impacts of light pollution. The 10 pm chapter discusses night festivals around the world and throughout history. The 11 pm chapter explains the circadian rhythm and the physiology of sleep and dreams.|$|E
