5|$|The season officially {{began on}} May 15 for the Eastern Pacific, and June 1 for the Central Pacific. It ended on November 30 for both regions. These dates delimit {{the time when}} most {{tropical}} cyclones form in this part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> The first system formed on May 24 and the final depression dissipated on November 16.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} {{practical}} solar boat {{was constructed in}} England. By 1995, passenger boats incorporating PV panels began appearing and are now used extensively. In 1996, Kenichi Horie made the first solar-powered crossing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean,</b> and the Sun21 catamaran made the first solar-powered crossing of the Atlantic Ocean {{in the winter of}} 2006–2007. There were plans to circumnavigate the globe in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Most {{molluscs}} with shells {{can produce}} pearls, {{but only the}} pearls of bivalves and some gastropods, whose shells are lined with nacre, are valuable. The best natural pearls are produced by marine pearl oysters, Pinctada margaritifera and Pinctada mertensi, which live in the tropical and subtropical waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Natural pearls form when a small foreign object gets stuck between the mantle and shell.|$|E

5|$|On July 19, 2009, exactly 15 {{years after}} the SL9 impacts, a new black spot about the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> {{appeared}} in Jupiter's southern hemisphere. Thermal infrared measurements showed the impact site was warm and spectroscopic analysis detected the production of excess hot ammonia and silica-rich dust in the upper regions of Jupiter's atmosphere. Scientists have concluded that another impact event had occurred, but this time a more compact and strong object, probably a small undiscovered asteroid, was the cause.|$|E
5|$|The Catlins has a cool {{maritime}} temperate climate, somewhat {{cooler than}} {{other parts of}} the South Island, and strongly modified by the effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Winds can reach considerable strength, especially on the exposed coast; most of the South Island's storms develop to the south or southwest of the island, and thus the Catlins catches the brunt of many of these weather patterns.|$|E
5|$|The Columbia and {{its tributaries}} have been central to the region's culture and economy for {{thousands}} of years. They {{have been used for}} transportation since ancient times, linking the region's many cultural groups. The river system hosts many species of anadromous fish, which migrate between freshwater habitats and the saline waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> These fish—especially the salmon species—provided the core subsistence for native peoples.|$|E

5|$|The United States Exploring Expedition led by Lieutenant Charles Wilkes was {{tasked with}} a vast survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> {{starting}} in 1838. In September 1840 they arrived in Honolulu, where repairs to the ships took longer than expected. Wilkes decided to spend the winter in Hawaii and {{take the opportunity to}} explore its volcanoes while waiting for better weather to continue the expedition. King Kamehameha III assigned American medical missionary Dr. Gerrit P. Judd to the expedition as a translator.|$|E
5|$|A rift {{opened and}} {{subsequently}} flooded {{the region as}} part of the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic (by about 755million years ago) and the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> A shoreline similar to the present Atlantic Ocean margin of the United States lay to the east. An algal mat-covered carbonate bank was deposited, forming the Noonday Dolomite. Subsidence of the region occurred as the continental crust thinned and the newly formed Pacific widened, forming the Ibex Formation. An angular unconformity (an uneven gap in the geologic record) followed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{humanity}} and the Overlords have peaceful relations, some believe human innovation is being suppressed and that culture is becoming stagnant. One {{of these groups}} establishes New Athens, an island colony in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> devoted to the creative arts, which George and Jean Greggson join. The Overlords conceal {{a special interest in}} the Greggsons' children, Jeffrey and Jennifer Anne, and intervene to save Jeffrey's life when a tsunami strikes the island. The Overlords have been watching them since the incident with the Ouija board, which revealed the seed of the coming transformation hidden within Jean.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Hurricane Ismael was {{predicted}} to remain over the open waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> However, when a northward motion became apparent, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Manzanillo, Colima, to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco and for the Islas Marias. Shortly thereafter, the warning was extended to Los Mochis and issued for the eastern coast of Baja California Sur south of 25° N. Ten hours before Ismael made its final landfall, the Mexican government issued a hurricane warning from Mazatlán to Los Mochis. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the hurricane, 1,572people evacuated to five emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|Seattle {{is located}} between the {{saltwater}} Puget Sound (an arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean)</b> {{to the west}} and Lake Washington to the east. The city's chief harbor, Elliott Bay, is part of Puget Sound, which makes the city an oceanic port. To the west, beyond Puget Sound, are the Kitsap Peninsula and Olympic Mountains on the Olympic Peninsula; to the east, beyond Lake Washington and the Eastside suburbs, are Lake Sammamish and the Cascade Range. Lake Washington's waters flow to Puget Sound through the Lake Washington Ship Canal (consisting of two man-made canals, Lake Union, and the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks at Salmon Bay, ending in Shilshole Bay on Puget Sound).|$|E
5|$|Sediments {{of certain}} abyssal plains contain {{abundant}} mineral resources, notably polymetallic nodules. These potato-sized concretions of manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper, distributed on the seafloor at depths of greater than 4000meters, are of significant commercial interest. The area of maximum commercial interest for polymetallic nodule mining (called the Pacific nodule province) lies in international waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean,</b> stretching from 118°–157°, and from 9°–16°N, {{an area of}} more than 3 million km². The abyssal Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCFZ) is an area within the Pacific nodule province that is currently under exploration for its mineral potential.|$|E

5|$|The bayside {{residential}} area called La Playa lies somewhat {{north of the}} original La Playa, the beach where commercial and military ships anchored during {{the early days of}} the city. La Playa includes some of the most expensive homes in San Diego. Some bayfront homes have private piers for small boats. The hills above La Playa are known as the Wooded Area on the bay side of Catalina Boulevard (so called because of the many mature trees in the area), and the College Area on the ocean side (because of the proximity of Point Loma Nazarene College). The Sunset Cliffs neighborhood is on the west side, above ocean bluffs, and is known for its views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b>|$|E
5|$|The closest {{relative}} of H.estellinensis is the shore crab Hemigrapsus oregonensis, which lives {{along the coast}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> The entire genus is restricted to the Pacific Ocean, except for Hemigrapsus affinis which lives along the Atlantic coasts of South America, from Cape San Roque (Rio Grande do Norte state, Brazil) to the Gulf of San Matías (Patagonia, Argentina), and population of Hemigrapsus sanguineus which have been introduced from the species' native range in East Asia to the Atlantic coast of the United States from Portland, Maine to North Carolina, and to the English Channel and North Sea.|$|E
5|$|The large {{populations of}} {{tortoises}} and marine turtles on Rodrigues {{resulted in the}} export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of Aplonis starlings have become extinct in islands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean,</b> and rats also contributed to their demise.|$|E

5|$|Around 59 {{species of}} {{pigeons and doves}} are {{threatened}} with extinction today, about 19% of all species. Most of these are tropical and live on islands. All of the species are threatened by introduced predators, habitat loss, hunting, {{or a combination of}} these factors. In some cases, they may be extinct in the wild, as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats. In some areas, a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown; the Negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953, and {{may or may not be}} extinct, and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Leopard {{spent much}} of her career in the main Austro-Hungarian fleet. During this period, she visited Spain for the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition, and took part in an {{international}} naval demonstration off Crete in 1897 in an attempt to limit the Greco-Turkish War. From 1900, Leopard made two major overseas deployments, including a tour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> in 19001901, and a stint in the East Asia squadron in 19071909. Upon returning to Austria-Hungary, the ship was modernized in 1910 and then decommissioned in May 1914, shortly before the start of World War I in July. The ship was immediately reactivated and stationed in Pola as a guard ship, where she remained {{for the duration of the}} conflict. After Austria-Hungary's defeat, Leopard was ceded to Britain as a war prize and sold to ship breakers in Italy in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Pacific Rim is a 2013 American {{science fiction}} monster film {{directed}} by Guillermo del Toro and starring Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Burn Gorman, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini, and Ron Perlman. The screenplay {{was written by}} Travis Beacham and del Toro from a story by Beacham. The film {{is set in the}} future, when Earth is at war with the Kaiju, colossal monsters which have emerged from an interdimensional portal on the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers, gigantic humanoid mechas each controlled by at least two pilots, whose minds are joined by a mental link. Focusing on the war's later days, the story follows Raleigh Becket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement and teamed with rookie pilot Mako Mori as part of a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kaiju.|$|E
