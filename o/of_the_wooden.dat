5|$|The {{high number}} of {{casualties}} was a consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> construction of the building, the poorly marked escape routes and the shortage of safety equipment.|$|E
5|$|Commodore Tom Henry, {{commanding}} Submarine Squadron 10, {{supervised the}} completion of the plaque. The carving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> form was done by retired Chief Electrician's Mate Ernest L. Benson at New London. The actual molding of the plaque was done by the Mystic Foundry.|$|E
25|$|After the Seedamm {{was built}} in 1878, the Heilig Hüsli chapel was the only {{remaining}} structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medieval <b>wooden</b> bridge. It stood isolated in the lake and was not accessible to visitors until <b>the</b> reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former <b>wooden</b> bridge was erected in 2001. <b>The</b> reconstructed <b>wooden</b> bridge is listed as Swiss heritage sites of national significance as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seedamm area including Heilig Hüsli and <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prehistoric <b>wooden</b> bridges respectively stilt house settlements.|$|R

5|$|During World War II {{the station}} was bombed, {{which led to the}} {{destruction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> spire of the clock tower above the ticket office on 3 January 1941. Gas lighting was replaced by fluorescent electric lights in 1960.|$|E
5|$|López I {{fortified}} Humaitá {{in the era}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> paddle-steamer warship. Gloire, {{the first}} ironclad warship was not launched until 1859 {{and that was in}} France, intended for a blue-water navy; and no battles between European ironclads had actually happened.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} {{manufacture}} {{varied between the}} various cultures that used them. Initially {{the tips of the}} limbs were made to bend when the bow was drawn. Later, the tips were stiffened with bone or antler laths; post-classical bows usually have stiff tips, known as siyahs, which are made as an integral part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> core of the bow.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> conquest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{region by}} the Habsburgs, <b>the</b> {{inhabitants}} <b>of</b> Bocșa became, in majority, Greek Catholic. Communist government imposed {{a return to}} the Orthodox faith and a brick church replaced <b>the</b> ancient <b>wooden</b> church. At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> church was transported to the Village Museum in Bucharest.|$|R

5|$|The {{exterior}} of the observatory building has a brick cornice, with stone sills and lintels, stone water course, ornamental gutters, and original copper downspouts. Most of the building's windows are <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> double-hung variety and original, as are the front entrance door transom and concrete stoop. The original front balustrade has been replaced, however, the western stoop and ornamental iron balustrade is still original.|$|E
5|$|Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> {{beams and}} panels {{removed from the}} mosque during renovations in the 1930s shows they are made from Cedar of Lebanon and cypress.

5|$|Banton {{was already}} {{inhabited}} during pre-colonial times as proven by ancient artefacts such as wooden coffins and skeletal remains {{found in the}} island's caves in 1936 {{by a team of}} researchers from the National Museum of the Philippines. Among the artefacts was the Banton Cloth, a piece of a traditional burial cloth found in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> coffins. It is estimated to be 400 years old, making it the earliest known warp ikat (tie-resist dyeing) textile in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. These artifacts are now preserved at the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.|$|E
25|$|The Violano Virtuoso was {{designed}} for public places, and can {{be considered to be}} a beautiful work <b>of</b> craftsmanship. <b>The</b> <b>wooden</b> cabinet in which the mechanism was housed could be oak or mahogany.|$|R
50|$|According to <b>the</b> cadastres <b>of</b> 1623—1624, <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> Pokrov Church <b>of</b> Our Lady {{was located}} in <b>the</b> village <b>of</b> Zaponorye/Vlasyevskoye. In 1678, the village was home to ten peasant homesteads, which {{comprised}} 36 people.|$|R
25|$|The ship, {{in service}} for 25 years, was {{overhauled}} {{shortly before the}} voyage, and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hull's <b>wooden</b> parts were renewed.|$|R
5|$|By the 1870s, Chicago {{had become}} the main {{financial}} center for the West, but in October 1871 the Great Chicago Fire destroyed the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> structures within city. The city was rebuilt on large plots of land in a new grid network and followed new city ordinances that prohibited construction in wood. These factors encouraged the building of taller properties in new innovative designs, which, like New York, saw a range of businesses and services being packed into single buildings.|$|E
5|$|Cracking {{along the}} {{vertical}} join <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> panels was {{severe enough to}} warrant a third restoration in 1982. Raking light revealed that modern varnishes had yellowed, while further overpainting was found. Working under ultraviolet light, paint from earlier restorations was removed, uncovering lost colours and landscape details, including the snow-capped mountains and birds of prey on the upper left. Restorers found clues to sources of confusion in earlier restorations, especially the unusual positioning of Francis's tonsure and Leo's feet, which were discovered to be crossed under his body.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with {{the other end of}} the rod placed deep into the ground. The sharp point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E
50|$|In 1888, a new stone {{station was}} built on <b>the</b> south side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tracks; <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> station was split into two {{sections}} which were reused as houses still standing near Magoun Square. The new station was made of red marble ashlar with rough marble trim; the waiting room featured a marble fireplace.|$|R
25|$|When Hurricane Hattie hit {{the island}} in 1961, a storm surge swept across <b>the</b> narrow part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village. <b>The</b> <b>wooden</b> schoolhouse, {{being used as a}} shelter at the time, was smashed by the waves killing 13 people (mostly children). Fortunately, <b>the</b> eye <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm passed to <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island sparing it.|$|R
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship's <b>wooden</b> hull was lost, but <b>the</b> layout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship {{could be}} seen from <b>the</b> {{placement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anchors, guns and fasteners.|$|R
5|$|Heazlewood {{speculated that}} the later 1865 church was {{probably}} used for classes due the small size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> school building. The school grew to around 100 pupils on the register in 1900. The church building, also used for Wesleyen Sunday school, {{was used as a}} school until 1929. For this period the Education Department rented it from the Church trustees. A new school was built, on donated land, opposite the church and next to the recreation ground. This state school was opened in a ceremony on 23 August 1929. The school remained open as late as the end of 1954.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 the Norwegian Air Force {{took control}} over the {{airfield}} and commenced reconstruction. That year, the air force operated a service from Bardufoss Air Station via Banak to Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen, with correspondence to Oslo at Bardufoss. The service lasted only the one season. Later the runway was used to serve air ambulances. During the late 1940s, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> runway was removed and used for other construction projects.|$|E
5|$|Internally, Salvin knocked through {{existing}} {{rooms to}} create the Outer Hall, a new gallery on the first floor, a billiard room, a new library and a drawing room. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> 17th-century panelling in the parlour and the hall had to be stripped out {{as part of the}} renovations. As part of his work, Salvin appears to have used a number of rolled wrought-iron beams to span the resulting structural gaps in the building, an advanced use of that technology for the time. The house was refurnished with newly bought 16th and 17th-century artwork, two brass Italian cannons and a stuffed polar bear.|$|E
25|$|With <b>the</b> advent <b>of</b> {{steam engines}} and vessels made out <b>of</b> metal, <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> sailing cutters {{fell out of}} use and many were sold and later lost. Only a {{relative}} handful <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many Bristol Channel pilot cutters survive today.|$|R
50|$|According to PMC’s {{heritage}} cell chief Shyam Dhavale, {{the bricks}} mriginal wada, are specially being recreated. And so are some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> windows, <b>wooden</b> pillars and motifs.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> {{agriculture}} base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town {{changed in}} the 16th century with a brick-making industry developing around Luton; many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older <b>wooden</b> houses were rebuilt in brick.|$|R
5|$|Several archaeological {{investigations}} into the tower were {{carried out in the}} post war period. Investigations were carried out during the renovations throughout 1948 to 1956. Further work followed to the east of the tower between 1962 and 1964, uncovering the landing dock. Another project was carried out in 1994 and 1995, uncovering part of the original garden of the tower and the 16th century adjoining timber house, and an architectural survey between 2009 and 2011 determined that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> doors on the second floor was probably an original feature from 1365.|$|E
5|$|Several churches {{bear the}} name of St Oswald,including The Church of Saint Oswald on the {{location}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> cross left by Oswald at Heavenfield, {{the night before the}} battle. This was rebuilt in 1717. The site is visible from the B6318 Military Road. St Oswald's Grasmere is purportedly on one of the sites he preached on, on a bank of the River Rothay. William Wordsworth's grave is located in the cemetery here.St Oswald's Catholic Church lies to the north of Peterborough City Centre.|$|E
5|$|The Crusades {{also led}} to the {{introduction}} of machicolations into Western architecture. Until the 13thcentury, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed the same purpose as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> form. Machicolations were used in the East long before the arrival of the Crusaders, and perhaps as early as {{the first half of the}} 8thcentury in Syria.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{destruction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship's <b>wooden</b> bridge during <b>the</b> hurricane, a new iron bridge was later installed {{on all four}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvania class vessels.|$|R
50|$|Børsa Church (Børsa kirke) is {{a parish}} church in <b>the</b> {{municipality}} <b>of</b> Skaun in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. It {{is located in}} <b>the</b> village <b>of</b> Børsa. <b>The</b> <b>wooden</b> building was designed by the architect Christian Heinrich Grosch, and it was completed in 1857.|$|R
50|$|During a {{demonstration}} in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Parliament in 2001, a Molotov cocktail was thrown at one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guardhouses. <b>The</b> <b>wooden</b> construction was engulfed in flames. The Evzone on guard {{next to it}} remained in place until an officer gave him the order to move. With a scorched and partly smoking uniform on one side, the Evzone did so.|$|R
