5|$|The General Theory is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> as the {{foundation}} of modern macroeconomics. Few senior American economists agreed with Keynes through most of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal's double envelopment at Cannae is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} battlefield maneuvers in history, and is cited as the first successful use of the pincer movement within the Western world to be recorded in detail.|$|E
5|$|Twentieth-century feminist critics {{embraced the}} work, {{integrating}} {{it into the}} history of the novel and feminist discourse. It is most <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> as a fictionalized popularization of the Rights of Woman, as an extension of Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in Rights of Woman, and as autobiographical.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{approaches}} <b>often</b> <b>view</b> myths as {{manifestations of}} psychological, cultural, or societal truths, {{rather than as}} inaccurate historical accounts.|$|R
50|$|A pair of boys in Mayu's {{class who}} <b>often</b> <b>view</b> her {{interactions}} {{with her friends}} {{as some kind of}} yuri scenario.|$|R
50|$|Commentaries on The Bible <b>often</b> <b>view</b> {{the account}} of Isaac's first view of Rebekah (Genesis 24:67) as love at first sight.|$|R
5|$|Lycian {{architecture}} and sculpture {{are on the}} same level as Greek, but to the Greeks, the Lycians, along with other non-Greek peoples of S.W. Anatolia, were <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> as barbarians. From c.550BC Greek pottery is found in quantity in Lycia; the Lion Tomb, Pillar of the Wrestlers, and the pillars at Isinda and Trysa are all distinctly Greek in style with little eastern symbolism.|$|E
5|$|Many of the NSS {{agents have}} close {{personal}} ties to one another, {{and the floor}} supervisor and head of security resources, Yang Jung-in (Kim Hye-jin), is no exception. She is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> as a dependable and accommodating authority figure and remains a very close friend to colleague Choi Seung-Hee.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to turning}} onto Rutgers Street, CR-506 runs along Washington Street {{concurrent}} {{with the northern}} section of Route 7. Though the northern section of Route 7 begins a few blocks south, it is not readily recognized (minimal signing). As CR-506 runs concurrently with it here, and then turns down Rutgers for the short distance that bridges {{the gap between the}} two Route 7 sections, Rutgers/506 is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> as if it continues Route 7, while the short portion of the northern section that lies south of Rutgers is sometimes seen as a spur, even though {{it is part of the}} main route.|$|E
50|$|Opponents of the takfiris <b>often</b> <b>view</b> them as modern-day analogues of the Khawarij, a seventh-century {{offshoot}} Islamic sect which waged {{war against}} the Caliphate.|$|R
25|$|Russians may <b>often</b> <b>view</b> {{the three}} republics as {{integral}} parts of Russia, especially since Russians are {{an overwhelming majority}} of the resident population in Adygea.|$|R
5000|$|A {{perceptive}} {{illusion that}} may be infused in film culture {{is the idea of}} Gestalt psychology, which holds that people <b>often</b> <b>view</b> the whole of an object as opposed to the sum of its individual parts.|$|R
5|$|Throughout its range, {{the giant}} otter interacts with {{indigenous}} groups, who often practice traditional hunting and fishing. A study of five indigenous communities in Colombia suggests native {{attitudes toward the}} animal are a threat: the otters are <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> as a nuisance that interferes with fishing, and are sometimes killed. Even when told {{of the importance of}} the species to ecosystems and the danger of extinction, interviewees showed little interest in continuing to coexist with the species. Schoolchildren, however, had a more positive impression of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Ways of life <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> as more rigid, such as {{soldiers}} and religious cultures, frequently have explicit rules regarding hair length. For example, Buddhist monks shave their heads {{as part of}} their order of worship. Similarly, religious men with long hair include the Nazarites of the Hebrew Bible (Samson being a famous example) and the Sikhs. Subservient cultures may view male long hair negatively, and are sometimes detected by their rulers through hair length, {{as was the case with}} the Gaelic Irish under English rule and the Moors under Spanish rule in Medieval Spain.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{historians have}} had mostly {{negative}} assessments of Ivan Shishman. He is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> as having intruded onto the throne {{due to the}} intrigues {{of his mother and}} thus taking the place of the rightful successor, his elder brother Ivan Sratsimir. This eventually resulted in the division of the country {{on the eve of the}} Ottoman invasion. There are no direct historical sources to suggest any significant attempts by Ivan Shishman to fight off the Turks. The inconsistent policy of Ivan Shishman has been described as revealing his weakness and inability to cope with the situation. His rule, however, was still remembered in the 16th century. In a treaty signed in 1519 between the Ottoman sultan Selim I and Louis II of Hungary, some of the lands in question were referred to as terra cesaris Sysman, “the land of emperor Shishman”.|$|E
25|$|Critics <b>often</b> <b>view</b> Spirit of Eden as a {{departure}} from Talk Talk's earlier and more accessible albums. Compared to their 1986 hit The Colour of Spring, it was a commercial disappointment. However, it has received widespread critical praise.|$|R
50|$|Many of Harland's novels contain maps. He has {{confessed to}} {{a fascination with}} maps, {{sometimes}} spending hours studying them. He has also admitted to <b>often</b> <b>viewing</b> his fictional worlds as though seen from an elevated distance, something he feels is a common feature among fantasy writers.|$|R
50|$|Just as {{they are}} {{critical}} and distrustful of most government endeavors, anarchists <b>often</b> <b>view</b> the stated reasons for war with a cynical eye. Since the Vietnam War protests in North America and, most recently, the protests {{against the war in}} Iraq, much anarchist activity has been anti-war based.|$|R
5|$|Cancers can {{be induced}} in animals at many sites. At {{sufficiently}} high doses TCDD has caused cancer in all animals tested. The most sensitive is liver cancer in female rats, {{and this has}} long been a basis for risk assessment. Dose-response of TCDD in causing cancer {{does not seem to be}} linear, and there is a threshold below which it seems to cause no cancer. TCDD is not mutagenic or genotoxic, in other words, it is not able to initiate cancer, and the cancer risk is based on promotion of cancer initiated by other compounds or on indirect effects such as disturbing defense mechanisms of the body e.g. by preventing apoptosis or programmed death of altered cells. Carcinogenicity is associated with tissue damage, and it is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> now as secondary to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{key points}} {{stressed}} in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. Gawain was written {{around the time of}} the Black Death and Peasants' Revolt, events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture. However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Kerala is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> {{as the ideal}} {{progressive}} leader in the women’s rights movement in India among states. Kerala maintains very high relative levels of female literacy and women’s health, as well as greater female inheritance and property rights. For example, a 1998 study conducted by Bina Agarwal found that while only 13% of all women in India with landowning fathers inherited that land as daughters, 24% of such women {{were able to do}} so in the state of Kerala. This is important because it has been shown that measures to improve such access to property and economic independence through channels such as education not only directly improve women’s wellbeing and capabilities, but also reduce their risk of exposure to marital or any sort of domestic violence.|$|E
50|$|Turkmen can {{be divided}} into various social classes {{including}} the urban intelligentsia and workers whose role in society is {{different from that of the}} rural peasantry. Secularism and atheism remain prominent for many Turkmen intellectuals who favor moderate social changes and <b>often</b> <b>view</b> extreme religiousity and cultural revival with some measure of distrust.|$|R
5000|$|By the 1920s, travel across North America {{by train}} to {{experience}} the [...] "wilderness" [...] (<b>often</b> <b>viewing</b> it only through windows) had become very popular. This led to the commercialization of some of Canada's National Parks with the building of great hotels such as the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise.|$|R
40|$|Trust {{terminations}} pose {{ethical problems}} for lawyers. Beneficiaries <b>often</b> <b>view</b> the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s lawyer as 2 ̆ 2 their 2 ̆ 2 lawyer. The Code of Professional Responsibility and the recently adopted Model Rules of Professional Conduct provide little guidance in resolving the {{conflicts of interest}} that arise in trust termination...|$|R
5|$|Thedas is a {{world in}} which race and class combine to {{determine}} social class. Elves are <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> as second-class citizens by humans, while human nobles are treated with respect. Mages, on the other hand, are cloistered by the Chantry: they have access to the Fade, the unconscious realm that is the home of spirits, and a single lapse in vigilance could cause them to be possessed by demons. Apostate mages, who live outside the Chantry's control, are considered extremely dangerous, and the Chantry has a militant wing, the Templars, to seek them out and subdue them by any means necessary. Dwarves live in the Deep Roads, their kingdom a shadow of what it once was before the first Blight. Their society is rooted in tradition and a rigid caste system.|$|E
5|$|Work Kommandos {{were very}} variable, but those in {{agriculture}} were generally considered better than ones in factories or mining, where conditions were worse and prisoners were vulnerable to Allied bombing raids. In {{rural areas of}} Germany, French prisoners replaced locals conscripted into the German army as agricultural labourers. Guarding Kommandos came {{to be regarded as}} an unnecessary waste of manpower - it was thought unlikely that a prisoner would attempt to escape in a country where he did not know the language. This meant that, in practice, prisoners were allowed a wider measure of freedom compared to the camps. They were <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> with curiosity by the German rural population, and the French prisoners were often allowed to mix quite freely with German civilians. Although unlawful, many French prisoners began relationships with German women.|$|E
5|$|After {{his brother}} Virgil was maimed in an ambush and Morgan was assassinated by hidden assailants, the men {{suspected}} of involvement were provided alibis by fellow Cowboys and released without trial. Wyatt {{and his brother}} Warren {{set out on a}} vendetta ride to locate and kill those they felt were responsible. Wyatt has been portrayed in a number of films and books as a fearless Western hero. He is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> as the central character and hero of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, at least in part because {{he was the only one}} who was not wounded or killed. In fact, his brother, Tombstone Marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp had considerably more experience with weapons and combat as a Union soldier in the Civil War, and in law enforcement as a sheriff, constable, and marshal. As city marshal, Virgil made the decision to disarm the Cowboys in Tombstone and requested Wyatt's assistance. But because Wyatt outlived Virgil and due to a creative biography, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal published two years after Wyatt's death, Wyatt became famous and the subject of various movies, television shows, biographies and works of fiction.|$|E
50|$|There {{are only}} a few {{psychological}} services available to those addicted, the such as Ministry of Public Health's Center of Gambling Studies. For Thais, gambling—lotteries, casinos, football betting and other variants—are viewed as entertainment. Very few seek treatment from medical professionals as Thais <b>often</b> <b>view</b> gambling as a social problem rather than a medical issue.|$|R
25|$|Liberal Christianity <b>often</b> <b>views</b> {{the devil}} metaphorically. This {{is true of}} some Conservative Christian groups too, such as the Christadelphians and the Church of the Blessed Hope. Much of the popular lore of the devil is not biblical; instead, it is a post-medieval Christian reading of the scriptures {{influenced}} by medieval and pre-medieval Christian popular mythology.|$|R
50|$|Raw {{upper air}} data is {{routinely}} ingested by numerical models. Forecasters <b>often</b> <b>view</b> {{the data in}} a graphical format, plotted on thermodynamic diagrams such as Skew-T log-P diagrams, Tephigrams, and or Stüve diagrams, all useful for {{the interpretation of the}} atmosphere's vertical thermodynamics profile of temperature and moisture as well as kinematics of vertical wind profile.|$|R
5|$|The camera {{work and}} editing work {{together}} to further heighten the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film are also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots in which they can see out a window to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.|$|E
25|$|DevOps is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> as an {{approach}} to applying systems administration work to cloud technology.|$|E
25|$|The 1975 IRA-British truce is <b>often</b> <b>viewed</b> as {{the event}} that began the {{challenge}} to the original Provisional Sinn Féin leadership, which was dominated by southerners like Ó Brádaigh and Ó Conaill.|$|E
50|$|While other hardboiled heroes {{bend and}} {{manipulate}} the law, Hammer <b>often</b> <b>views</b> {{it as an}} impediment to justice, the one virtue he holds in absolute esteem. Hammer nevertheless has a strong respect {{for the majority of}} police, realizing they have a difficult job and their hands are frequently tied by the law when trying to stop criminals.|$|R
25|$|While {{strongly}} desiring intimacy, {{people with}} BPD tend toward insecure, avoidant or ambivalent, or fearfully preoccupied attachment patterns in relationships, and they <b>often</b> <b>view</b> {{the world as}} dangerous and malevolent. BPD, like other personality disorders, is linked to increased levels of chronic stress and conflict in romantic relationships, decreased satisfaction {{on the part of}} romantic partners, abuse, and unwanted pregnancy.|$|R
40|$|When {{visiting a}} {{collection}} of old music such as those held at the British Museum in London, I am often struck by the beauty and painstaking effort that went into producing these music manuscripts from what we loosely call the Middle Ages.
