5|$|Georgia's defense {{managed a}} strong {{performance}} statistically and in real terms. The most obvious {{examples of this}} were the threeinterceptions and one forced fumble {{that proved to be}} the turning point in the game. Two of the interceptions were caught by linebacker Tony Taylor, who also had ninetackles, two for a loss <b>of</b> <b>yards.</b> The tackles tied him with Paul Oliver, who also had nine. The third interception came from Kelin Johnson, while the fumble was forced by Charles Johnson. Johnson had an active day as well. In addition to the forced fumble, he recorded fourtackles, twosacks, and a passbreak-up.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of four hours, a series of blunders in {{planning}} and communication had caused Lee's forces to launch three failed frontal infantry assaults across hundreds <b>of</b> <b>yards</b> of open ground, unsupported by Confederate artillery, charging toward firmly entrenched Union infantry and artillery defenses. These errors provided Union forces {{with an opportunity to}} inflict heavy casualties. In the aftermath of the battle, however, the Confederate press heralded Lee as the savior of Richmond. In stark contrast, McClellan was accused of being absent from the battlefield, a harsh criticism that haunted him when he ran for president in 1864.|$|E
5|$|On Cutler's {{touchdown}} pass to Jeffery, he tied Sid Luckman for the most {{touchdown pass}}es in Bears history with 137. Defensively, Pernell McPhee recorded his fifth sack during the game, and {{he became the first}} Bears player since Brian Urlacher in 2000 to have at least five sacks and one interception in the first seven games. During the second half, Matt Forte suffered a knee injury, and along with Eddie Royal, were missed the following week's game. The loss of Forte had been crucial for the Bears, as he had been responsible for 32 percent <b>of</b> <b>yards</b> gained in 2015, the most among running backs.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{community}} service activities are (1) to identify the potential <b>of</b> <b>yard</b> to be developed into yard farming; (2) to identify the level of public participation in the development <b>of</b> <b>yard</b> farming; and (3) to increase the community’s {{active role in the}} implementation <b>of</b> <b>yard</b> farming development.  Implementation of the community service carried out in the village of the District Muntuk Dlingo. The activities are manifested into counseling and interviews to the public figures and civil society. Counseling is conducted using face-to-face interview and a discussion in regards to development <b>of</b> farm <b>yard.</b> Interview is conducted on public figures and civil society regardless to the participation on the counselling. The results found that the Muntuk Village has a big potential <b>of</b> <b>yard</b> to be developed as a farming yard. The result also found that Muntuk villagers have high participation rates and high active role to develop the program. Participation and active role of the community indicated a desire to try to take advantage of yard before the rainy season...|$|R

Longer range testing {{took place at}} Naval Air Station Point Mugu, firing out over the Pacific Ocean. For full-scale tests, the Army built an entire Zeus base on Kwajalein Island in the Pacific, where it could be tested against ICBMs launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Test firings at Kwajalein began in June 1962; these were very successful, passing within hundreds <b>of</b> <b>yards</b> of the warheads, and even low-flying satellites.|$|E
5|$|In week nine, the All-Americans {{played the}} Bulldogs. Jim Thorpe, who was later {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, started the game for the Bulldogs, but he came out at halftime because he believed it would end in a tie. Both teams were slowed by a muddy field, and the football became soggy after three quarters. Neither the All-Americans nor the Bulldogs could gain a lot <b>of</b> <b>yards</b> during the game. The lone score of the game came with under four minutes to play: a field goal from the Bulldogs' Al Feeney. He never missed a field goal the entire 1920 season, and the final score of the game was 3–0.|$|E
5|$|Fontaneda {{explained}} in his 1571 memoir that Carlos controlled fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee (which they called Mayaimi) {{and on the}} Florida Keys (which they called Martires). Smaller tribes of Ais and Jaega who lived {{to the east of}} Lake Okeechobee, paid regular tributes to Carlos. The Spanish suspected the Calusa of harvesting treasures from shipwrecks and distributing the gold and silver between the Ais and Jaega, with Carlos receiving the majority. The main village of the Calusa, and home of Carlos, bordered Estero Bay at present-day Mound Key where the Caloosahatchee River meets the Gulf of Mexico. Fontaneda described human sacrifice as a common practice: when the child of a cacique died, each resident gave up a child to be sacrificed, and when the cacique died, his servants were sacrificed to join him. Each year a Christian was required to be sacrificed to appease a Calusa idol. The building of shell mounds of varying sizes and shapes was also of spiritual significance to the Calusa. In 1895 Frank Hamilton Cushing excavated a massive shell mound on Key Marco that was composed of several constructed terraces hundreds <b>of</b> <b>yards</b> long. Cushing unearthed over a thousand Calusa artifacts. Among them he found tools made of bone and shell, pottery, human bones, masks, and animal carvings made of wood.|$|E

5|$|The first {{long-lived}} supercell, which {{spawned the}} tornado with the longest continuous track of any single tornado to occur during this outbreak, developed around 4:50 pm CST (2250 UTC) southeast of Centerville in Yell County, Arkansas. The tornado touched {{down to the}} southwest of New Neely, causing minor damage to two structures and downing trees at EF0 to EF1 strength. The tornado tracked into Pope County, rapidly intensifying to EF3 strength as it slammed into Lucky Landing, a marina at Lake Atkins where multiple vehicles, boats, and mobile homes were destroyed, and one woman was killed. Continuing northeast, the tornado struck the southern and eastern edge of Atkins, killing three people. 65 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed, and 39 others were damaged {{to a lesser degree}} in the Atkins area. Several vehicles were blown off of Interstate 40, and six mobile homes were destroyed as well, with five others damaged. Northeast of Atkins, the tornado toppled metal truss towers, destroyed chicken houses, and heavily damaged a large church and gym. In the Happy Bend area, another fatality occurred as a man abandoned his mobile home and sought shelter in a large metal shipping container, which was tossed hundreds <b>of</b> <b>yards</b> into a wooded area. The tornado continued on and crossed into Conway County at EF3 intensity, passing near the town of Cleveland. 36 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 6 sustained major damage, and 8 sustained minor damage along this segment of the path. Several chicken houses were completely destroyed, killing 80,000 chickens, and an elderly couple was killed when their mobile home was swept completely away.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{touched down}} north of Section, {{initially}} producing EF0 to EF1 tree damage. The tornado rapidly intensified to low-end EF4 strength {{as it passed}} northwest of Pisgah and Rosalie, destroying numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes, scattering the debris hundreds <b>of</b> <b>yards</b> and killing three people. Thousands of trees were snapped and debarked, vehicles were thrown up to 50 yards in different directions, and multiple barns and chicken houses were heavily damaged, along with {{the roof of a}} church. As it passed near Flat Rock and Higdon, the tornado reached high-end EF4 strength, mowing down thousands of trees in this rural area. As the tornado struck a farm, a home and two chicken houses were completely obliterated and swept away. A heavy propane tank was lofted and thrown 100 yards from one of the chicken houses, and 19 cattle on the property were killed. Remarkably, a family of four taking shelter inside the house were completely unharmed. The tornado maintained EF4 strength as it tore through the rural community of Shiloh, sweeping away numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes and killing 5 people at that location. Thousands of trees were snapped, a log cabin was destroyed, livestock was killed, chicken houses were flattened, and a van was lofted and dropped into a field 400 yards away from where it originated. The tornado then crossed into Georgia and struck Trenton as an EF3, killing two people. Dozens of homes in Trenton were completely destroyed, 18 others sustained major damage, {{and tens of thousands of}} trees were downed in the area. A grocery store, two apartment complexes, and a funeral home were destroyed as well.|$|E

40|$|Biomass {{makes up}} {{approximately}} 16 % of the landfills (this number can vary significantly {{depending upon the}} geographical location and time of the year). A majority of the biomass disposed in landfills is comprised <b>of</b> <b>yard</b> waste including grass and leaf clippings.

Twenty-four states have prohibited the disposal <b>of</b> <b>yard</b> waste in landfills with more states likely to follow suit. To conserve landfill space it is important to identify processes and methods for effective utilization and disposal <b>of</b> <b>yard</b> waste. It has been shown in this research that conformal coating of a biomass suspension can be utilized as an alternative daily cover (ADC) for the landfills. The biomass is ground into fine particles (d ≤ 2 mm) and suspended in a surfactant solution. This approach can reduce the cost of daily operations for the landfill and provide {{a solution to the problem}} <b>of</b> <b>yard</b> waste disposal...|$|R
