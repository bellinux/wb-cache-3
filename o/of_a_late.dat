5|$|Architecturally, Linwood House {{was a rare}} example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> Georgian / Regency style {{house in}} Canterbury.

5|$|Arsenal {{travelled}} to Goodison Park in {{the fourth}} round of the competition to play Everton.

5|$|Hélio Castroneves, the {{defending}} champion of the Indy Japan 300, won the pole position by posting the fastest lap in qualifying.

Kanaan took the lead because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> pit stop by Dixon, and held off a late challenge by Wheldon to secure first place.|$|E

The firehouse's distinguishing feature is the corbeled cornice and terracotta trim, but also it is historically {{significant as}} an example of Pawtucket's maturation as a city. The boundary for the property is listed as Plat 7B, lot 164 and includes the surrounding area, totaling less than one acre. Fire Station Number 4 was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 18, 1983.|$|E
5|$|The Patriarchal Cathedral of the Holy Ascension of God is not {{the first}} church {{building}} to occupy the position on top of the Tsarevets hill. It was constructed directly on top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> Roman (early Byzantine) basilica which dates to the 5th–6th century AD. The Roman basilica may have remained in use by the local congregation during the First Bulgarian Empire, though it was no longer active by the time the construction of the current church began.|$|E
5|$|A life of Augustine {{was written}} by Goscelin around 1090, but this life portrays Augustine in a {{different}} light than Bede's account. Goscelin's account has little new historical content, mainly being filled with miracles and imagined speeches. Building on this account, later medieval writers continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine's life, often quite fanciful. These authors included William of Malmesbury, who claimed that Augustine founded Cerne Abbey, the author (generally believed to be John Brompton) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> medieval chronicle containing invented letters from Augustine, and a number of medieval writers who included Augustine in their romances. Another problem with investigating Augustine's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and Augustine of Hippo, a fourth-century saint. Medieval Scandinavian liturgies feature Augustine of Canterbury quite often, however. During the English Reformation, Augustine's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost.|$|E

5|$|Applewood Farm {{has served}} as a farm for over a century, with an 1850 census {{reporting}} it produced butter, cheese, rye, Indian corn, oats, wool, Irish potatoes and hay. Three apple orchards planted by Russell Gallup would become an important part of Applewood Farms and owe its name to those orchards. After Everett Gallup took over the farm in the 1920s, the farm produced fresh fruits and vegetables and poultry, eggs and dairy products. In 1994, the Applewood Farm reported having 700 trees tapped for maple syrup production and showed visitors the process of producing the syrup. Applewood Farms was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 under criteria A for the Gallup family history that {{played an important role in}} the local history and under criteria C as an architecturally important example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> colonial center chimney house.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} for the group stages of the Champions League in the 2005–06 season on virtue of finishing runners-up in the Premier League the preceding season. They were drawn in Group B, along with Swiss' Thun, Czech club Sparta Prague and Ajax of the Netherlands. In spite of Van Persie's dismissal against Thun in the opening group match, Arsenal won 2–1, courtesy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> goal by substitute Bergkamp. A 2–1 win against Ajax {{was followed by a}} 2–0 victory against Sparta Prague; Henry scored both goals to surpass Ian Wright's all-time leading scorer record. A goal from Henry and two from Van Persie in the reverse fixture meant the club reached the knockout stages. A win at Thun on 22 November 2005 ensured Arsenal topped the group; they ended the group stages with a draw at Highbury against Ajax.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1897, it {{is a rare}} {{surviving}} example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> Victorian orangery in the Classical style, {{constructed from}} ashlar and red brick. It has a seven-bay east/west plan with central entrances and three bays north/south, topped by a fully glazed ironwork hipped-roof. An entablature with protruding horizontal geison sits above Ionic half-column supports and corner pilasters. The centre entrance bay on the west front towards the kitchen garden breaks forward as a portico, with pairs of giant engaged columns and broken pediment with a small oculus. Between each pair of columns are large round-headed windows with Gibbs surrounds and keystones.|$|E

5|$|Defoe {{was finally}} imprisoned on 21 May 1703, after {{avoiding}} his summons and evading capture. He was fined, made {{to stand in}} the pillory on three occasions and remained in prison till November; in the meantime, his business affairs sank into ruin. The whole affair left a lasting impression on him, which can be felt in his writings. In the years following his arrest and release, Defoe made several attempts to explain The Shortest Way and his own viewpoint. Amongst the series of explanatory pamphlets doing this are An Explanation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Late</b> Pamphlet, Entituled, The Shortest Way… (1703) and A Dialogue Between a Dissenter and the Observator (1703). The suspected involvement of the Tory Speaker of the House, Robert Harley, in obtaining the release of Defoe is credited as the beginning of their professional relationship, in which Defoe worked as a propagandist for Harley, after he succeeded Nottingham as Secretary of State in 1704.|$|E
5|$|From South Asia in general, {{there is}} secure {{evidence}} of such early settlement. Although not regarded as an anatomically modern Homo sapiens, a skull from the Central Narmada Valley in Madhya Pradesh, India, referred to as Narmada Man, is the first authenticated discovery <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> Middle Pleistocene (around 200,000 BP) hominid from South Asia. The discovery has sparked much debate regarding where it belongs in the taxonomic organisation of Pleicestone hominids. Its morphometric traits do not easily match those of Homo erectus, but they correlate with hominid specimens called archaic Homo sapiens, which include pre-Neanderthals from Europe and West Asia. Other classifications of the skull include Homo heidelbergensis and evolved Homo erectus, but the latter has been disputed by some as having no taxonomic meaning.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Graham Mourie captained New Zealand {{to their}} first Grand Slam, {{including}} a 13–12 victory over Wales.

Lock Andy Haden had dived out of a line-out {{in an attempt to}} earn a penalty, but referee Roger Quittenden insisted the penalty was against Welsh lock Geoff Wheel for jumping off the shoulder of Frank Oliver. New Zealand's only loss on the tour was the famous 12–0 defeat by Irish province Munster at Thomond Park. Later a play which focused on the loss was written by John Breen, called Alone it Stands.|$|E
