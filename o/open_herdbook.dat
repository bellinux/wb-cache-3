40|$|Through {{centuries of}} {{both natural and}} {{artificial}} selection, a variety of local cattle populations arose with highly specific phenotypes. However, the intensification and expansion of scale in animal production systems led to the predominance of a few highly productive cattle breeds. The loss of local populations is often considered irreversible and with them specific qualities and rare variants could be lost as well. Over these last years, the interest in these local breeds has increased again leading to increasing efforts to conserve these breeds or even revive lost populations, e. g. {{through the use of}} crosses with similar breeds. However, the remaining populations are expected to contain crossbred individuals resulting from introgressions. They are likely to carry exogenous genes that affect the breed's authenticity on a genomic level. Using the revived Campine breed as a case study, 289 individuals registered as purebreds were genotyped on the Illumina BovineSNP 50. In addition, genomic information on the Illumina BovineHD and Illumina BovineSNP 50 of ten breeds was available to assess the current population structure, genetic diversity, and introgression with phenotypically similar and/or historically related breeds. Introgression with Holstein and beef cattle genotypes was limited to only a few farms. While the current population shows a substantial amount of within-breed variation, the majority of genotypes can be separated from other breeds in the study, supporting the re-establishment of the Campine breed. The majority of the population is genetically close to the Deep Red (NL), Improved Red (NL) and Eastern Belgium Red and White (BE) cattle, breeds known for their historical ties to the Campine breed. This would support an <b>open</b> <b>herdbook</b> policy, thereby increasing the population size and consequently providing a more secure future for the breed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Many of {{the living}} {{heritage}} breeds are threatened by extinction due {{to the loss of}} their original function and/or competition with specialized breeds. The aim of this PhD research was to assess how genomic information may support the conservation of these living heritage breeds with the focus on two Belgian heritage breeds: Campine cattle and Belgian Draught horse. We did not only evaluate the genetic diversity in the Campine cattle and Belgian Draught horse, but also visualized the historical between breed relationships, the identification of selective sweeps in draught horses, and the identification of genomic regions associated to chronic progressive lymphedema, a complex disorder in the Belgian Draught horse. This PhD research assessed whether and to what extent exogenous genes still affect the authenticity of the Campine breed at a genomic level. Furthermore, the current population structure, genetic diversity, and introgression with phenotypically similar and/or historically related breeds such as MRY, Deep Red, Improved Red, Eastern Belgian Red and White was assessed. Introgression with Holstein and beef cattle genotypes in the Campine population was found to be limited to just a few farms. While the current population shows a substantial amount of within breed variation, the majority of genotypes can be separated from other breeds included in the study, supporting the re-establishment of the Campine breed. The majority of the population is genetically close to the Deep Red, Improved Red, and Eastern Belgium Red and White, breeds known for their historical ties to the Campine breed. These results could support the creation of an <b>open</b> <b>herdbook</b> policy among these populations which would increase the genetic breeding pool and may provide a more secure future for the breed. The past and current market stimulates farmers to utilize crossbreeding and/or breed replacement in their living heritage populations to accelerate genetic improvement and increase output. While bulls from the Durham cattle breed were often used to improve beef production {{at the turn of the}} 19 th century, the use of Holstein breeding bulls being preferred towards the second half of the 20 th century to upgrade milking traits. Additionally, the local populations themselves were part of transboundary cattle populations in which exchange occurred frequently. To assess whether historical ties are still present in modern day populations, the current local diversity was evaluated using the method of Eding. This also allows to assess whether a genetic print was left by recent Holstein and more distant Durham crosses. This method is used within and between breed kinships to create a core set. The use of the average kinship between and within populations demonstrated that many of the historical relationships among dual-purpose cattle breeds are still visible in the modern- day populations. However, in some cases the known historical ties between local breeds were difficult to reveal like for example in the Campine breed. This breed is still very diverse, which may have resulted in a low average kinship to other local breeds. Traces of these historical ties can still be seen when removing the breed from the core set as it resulted in increased contributions from many other local breeds. The results also highlighted the selection that took place against the presence of Durham genetics in local population as most of the current day dual-purpose populations no longer show a close relationship with Durham. When the genomic relationship between related breeds were less present this might have been a consequence of within breed selection, bottlenecks, and/or founder effects. Although popular for its specific draught conformation and willingness to work until the beginning of the 20 th century, the population of the Belgian Draught horse has decreased these past decades. This decline in population size is accompanied by an increasing concern for its genetic diversity. However, errors in pedigree recording and lack of pedigree depth make it difficult to utilize pedigree-based estimates. Furthermore, its conformation made it particularly suited for heavy labor and selection towards this end may still be visible in the presence of selective sweeps. Comparing pedigree-based and genomic estimates of inbreeding shows that the two differ substantially. While the effective population size based on pedigree and genomic information was similar, the pedigree-based estimates failed to reveal the substructure detected using PCA. This discrepancy can be explained by the ability of the genomic methods to detect population substructure and inbreeding caused by more distant relatedness predating pedigree recording, errors in pedigree recording, and/or import of horses. Within and between breed analyses showed a close relationship between the Belgian and Ardenner Draught and a more distant one with the Flemish Draught and Rhenish German Coldblood. As historical records show the historical ties between the four breeds, it is possible that a combination of founder effect, selection, genetic drift, and inbreeding led to the between-breed divergence. Finally, several signatures of selection on the chromosomes ECA 3, ECA 5, ECA 10, ECA 11, ECA 18 have been reported previously and are thought to be involved in both performance, conformation, coat color, and hereditary disorders. Finally, the intense selection on conformation and heavy limbs with abundant feathering in the Belgian Draught horse was likely accompanied with a selection for a condition called chronic progressive lymphedema. It results in a progressive lower limb swelling and deformation of the soft tissues of which the underlying cause remains unknown. Currently, two diverging hypotheses have been proposed; the first considers elastin alterations as the initial trigger of progressive lymphedema while the second considers chronic progressive lymphedema as an inflammatory dermatitis. Through the use of genome-wide and homozygosity association analyses the genetic background of this disease was analyzed. The genome-wide association study reached genome-wide significance on chromosome ECA 10 without the identification of a candidate gene. Several candidate genes described in previous studies on CPL (FOXC 2 (ECA 3), HET/MET (ECA 4), ubiquitin protein ligase E 3 A (ECA 1), and CD 109 (ECA 20)) were located in the proximity of regions surpassing nominal significance. All regions passing nominal significance in the genome-wide and homozygosity association analyses were subsequently analyzed using a pathway-based analysis. It suggests the involvement of several processes of the immune response and thereby supports the hypothesis that considers CPL as an inflammatory autoimmune response. It is possible that both are involved in the etiology of chronic progressive lymphedema. These results provide a first insight into the genetic background of chronic progressive lymphedema using a dense marker set. While these results were not conclusive, they do support the hypothesis of an inflammatory autoimmune response. Further research is needed to gain deeper insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying chronic progressive lymphedema and understand the involvement of both the skin elastic support system and immune response. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{highlight}} the need of monitoring small populations to conserve their genetic variability by using a set of parameters to characterize both the structure of populations and management practices. As a representative example we analyse the pedigree information of the endangered Xalda sheep breed of Asturias. The herdbook of Xalda sheep included a total of 805 animals and 62 herds. The number of founders was 329. Nowadays, there are 562 live animals and 26 active herds. The breed is in risk of losing genetic diversity because of the abusive use of certain individuals as parents. The effective number of founder animals is 81. 1. The effective number of founder herds is 9. 9. The average value of inbreeding in the whole Xalda population was 1. 5 %. The average relatedness (AR) coefficient reached 1. 8 % in the whole pedigree. The genetic representation of the lines of founders is unbalanced. Inbreeding trends and effective size do not provide realistic information concerning the risk of loss of diversity {{as a result of}} the shallowness of the genealogical information. We suggest the monitoring of the breed using AR to unbalance the genetic contributions of specific individuals, equalizing the genetic representation of the founders and lines in the population. In addition, AR can suggest the introduction of new, under-represented animals in herds showing high average AR values relative to the population. Our results can be useful to improve the development of conservation initiatives involving <b>open</b> <b>herdbooks</b> to avoid the risk of loss of genetic diversity caused by incorrect management practices...|$|R
