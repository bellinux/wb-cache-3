5|$|The United Nations Declaration on the Rights <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>Peoples</b> {{recognized}} {{the urgent need}} to respect and promote the rights <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with States. It {{also noted that the}} rights affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements between States and indigenous peoples are, in some situations, matters of international concern, interest, responsibility and character. In many instances the minority rights treaties provided for arbitration and granted the International Court of Justice jurisdiction to resolve disputes.|$|E
5|$|Acknowledgment of {{the wrongs}} {{done by the}} {{residential}} school system began in the 1980s. In 1986, at its 31st General Council, the United Church of Canada responded to the request <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> that it apologize to them for its part in colonization and in 1998 apologized expressly for the role it played in the residential school system.|$|E
5|$|Cultures <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> {{occupied}} the shoreline and bluffs {{in this area}} for thousands of years, {{taking advantage of the}} rich resources.

50|$|The World Bank http://www.worldbank.org/ {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{multilateral}} financial institutions to create guidelines to protect the rights <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>People's</b> in the 1980s, when it recognized that development negatively impacted the lives and cultures <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>People.</b> Its first policy was in 1987. It was designed by Bank staff without consultation <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>People</b> and was a statement on the need to protect <b>Indigenous</b> <b>People's.</b> Then in 1991 the Bank's Operational Directive 4.20 document acknowledged the need for participation <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>People</b> in the consultation process.|$|R
5000|$|The 3rd World Water Forum also {{invited the}} {{participation}} <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people,</b> recognizing that <b>indigenous</b> {{land and water}} rights {{is crucial to the}} discussion of water interests worldwide. <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> have often been excluded from discussions about clean drinking water, water sanitation, and rights to water sources, so this invitation legitimized the rights <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> to help create water related policy. Their participation resulted in the signing <b>of</b> the <b>Indigenous</b> <b>Peoples</b> Kyoto Declaration, which centered on the rights <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> to self determine usage of their own water resources.|$|R

5|$|Spain {{established}} twenty-one missions, {{indigenous peoples}} (the so-called Mission Indians) {{lived and worked}} {{under the supervision of}} missionaries. However, approximately 80% of the approximately 100,000 to 300,000 indigenous population of California remained outside the Missions.

5|$|Around {{the time}} of Federation, overall {{literacy}} in Sarawak was quite low. In 1960, the overall literacy rate was 25%, with a heavy slant in the literacy rate towards the Chinese population, 53%, compared with that <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> which was substantially lower, only 17%. By 2007, overall literacy in adults aged 15 and over had significantly increased to 92.3% and in 2012, this had climbed to 96%.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, most of {{the former}} Overhill sites were {{submerged}} by the impoundment of the Little Tennessee River in a Tennessee Valley Authority project. But, archaeologists conducted extensive excavations prior to this, during which they identified {{most of the}} Overhill towns and extracted thousands of artifacts, helping them develop volumes of invaluable information regarding the region's Cherokee and pre-Cherokee inhabitants. Different cultures <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> had lived along the river for 12,000 years.|$|E
40|$|Through the {{analysis}} of photographs and newspapers, I analyze specific representations <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>people</b> and cultures in the public arena, such as in museums and World’s Fairs. Using and modifying Edward Said’s model of Orientalism, I argue that these representations reinforced problematic and damaging ideas about aboriginal <b>people.</b> Representations <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries were beginning to take a form more familiar to us. The theory of Orientalism by Edward Said is a useful framework for studying and understanding how representations can perpetuate problematic and dangerous conceptions of others. By using the theory of Orientalism, I will examine racist representations <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> from across North and Central America created by anthropologists, photographers, and museums in the United States of America. Through the examination of photographs, newspapers and books, I will demonstrate some instances where these mediums have created a representation <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> that deny the agency <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>people</b> and create them in the image of a creature that is so obviously different from the “self. ...|$|R

5|$|Stereotypical and {{historically}} inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, {{they contribute to}} the development of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.|$|E
5|$|The Council <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>Peoples</b> {{consider}} several limited {{factors in}} a successful formal petition. The determining factors include collecting member genealogies, group histories {{and evidence of}} a continued linguistic and cultural identity. The lack of documentation and the extinction of many indigenous languages {{as the result of}} colonial cultural and language policies have made the prospect of official recognition of many ethnicities a remote possibility. Current trends in ethno-tourism have led many former Plains Aborigines to continue to seek cultural revival.|$|E
5|$|The Government of the Republic of China officially recognizes {{distinct}} people groups {{among the}} indigenous community {{based upon the}} qualifications drawn up by the Council <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>Peoples</b> (CIP). To gain this recognition, communities must gather a number of signatures and a body of supporting evidence with which to successfully petition the CIP. Formal recognition confers certain legal benefits and rights upon a group, {{as well as providing}} them with the satisfaction of recovering their separate identity as an ethnic group. As of June 2014, 16 people groups have been recognized.|$|E

5|$|The {{influence}} of 19th- and 20th-century missionaries has both transformed and maintained aboriginal integration. Many {{of the churches}} have replaced earlier community functions, but continue to retain a sense of continuity and community that unites members of aboriginal societies against the pressures of modernity. Several church leaders have emerged from within the communities to take on leadership positions in petitioning {{the government in the}} interest <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> and seeking a balance between the interests of the communities and economic vitality.|$|E
5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples,</b> especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests who sought to destroy all of the indigenous peoples native books and writings, he was strictly opposed to this action. Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the legal status of the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of colonialism. Las Casas is often seen {{as one of the first}} advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 16th century, eastern Honduras {{was still}} beyond the {{frontier}} of conquest. The region was known as Taguzgalpa, stretching from Trujillo in the north, to the valleys of Olancho, Jamastran and Agalta in the west, to the Guayape and Guayambre rivers in the south, and the Caribbean Sea in the east. The territory was well populated by a diverse range <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples,</b> including Lencas, Nahuas and Misumalpas. The exact political composition of the territory was unknown to the Spanish, such that the Spanish Crown prohibited campaigns of conquest and reduction in Taguzgalpa owing to ignorance of its makeup.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} El Salvador was the {{campaign}} {{undertaken by the}} Spanish conquistadores against the Late Postclassic Mesoamerican polities in the territory that is now incorporated into the modern Central American nation of El Salvador. El Salvador is the smallest country in Central America, and is dominated by two mountain ranges running east-west. Its climate is tropical, and the year is divided into wet and dry seasons. Before the conquest the country formed {{a part of the}} Mesoamerican cultural region, and was inhabited by a number <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples,</b> including the Pipil, the Lenca, the Xinca, and Maya. Native weaponry consisted of spears, bows and arrows, and wooden swords with inset stone blades; they wore padded cotton armour.|$|E
5|$|To {{some degree}} the {{movement}} has been successful. Beginning in 1998, the official curriculum in Taiwan schools has been changed to contain more frequent and favorable mention of aborigines. In 1996 the Council <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>Peoples</b> was promoted to a ministry-level rank within the Executive Yuan. The central government has taken steps to allow romanized spellings of aboriginal names on official documents, offsetting the long-held policy of forcing a Han name on an aborigine. A relaxed policy on identification now allows a child to choose their official designation if they are born to mixed aboriginal/Han parents.|$|E
5|$|Before the Spanish conquest, Chiapas was {{inhabited}} {{by a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples,</b> including the Zoques, various Maya peoples, such as the Lakandon Ch'ol and the Tzotzil, and an unidentified group {{referred to as the}} Chiapanecas. Soconusco had been incorporated into the Aztec Empire, centred in Valley of Mexico, and paid the Aztecs tribute. News of strangers first arrived in the region as the Spanish penetrated and overthrew the Aztec Empire. In the early 1520s, several Spanish expeditions crossed Chiapas by land, and Spanish ships scouted the Pacific coast. The first highland colonial town in Chiapas, San Cristóbal de los Llanos, was established by Pedro de Portocarrero in 1527. Within a year, Spanish dominion extended over the upper drainage basin of the Grijalva River, Comitán, and the Ocosingo valley. Encomienda rights were established, although in the earlier stages of conquest these amounted to little more than slave-raiding rights.|$|E

5|$|Living River Siam (Thai: โครงการแม่น้ำเพื่อชีวิต; {{formerly}} South East Asia Rivers Network, or SEARIN) is a Thai {{non-governmental organization}} (NGO) which analyzes {{the impact of}} Thailand's various dam projects and coordinates the research <b>of</b> <b>indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> to give Thai villagers the power to document the influence of local rivers and dams. Founded in 1999, it gained prominence during the Pak Mun Dam study period in 2001, when it developed a method for instructing villagers on how to document {{the effects of the}} dammed river on their lives. When the Thai government proposed other dam sites, Living River Siam took its research methods to the villages surrounding those sites as well. Today, the organization works with other NGOs in Southeast Asia to counter government-sponsored research that encourages dam construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} Iximche were first {{described}} by a Guatemalan historian in the late 17th century. They were visited various times by scholars during the 19th century, who published plans and descriptions. Serious investigations of the site started in the 1940s and continued sporadically until the early 1970s. In 1980, during the Guatemalan Civil War, a meeting {{took place at the}} ruins between guerillas and Maya leaders that resulted in the guerillas stating that they would defend indigenous rights. A ritual was carried out at the site in 1989 in order to reestablish the ruins as a sacred place for Maya ceremonies. United States President George W. Bush visited the site in 2007, and in the same year Iximche was the venue for the III Continental Summit <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>Peoples</b> and Nationalities of Abya Yala.|$|E
5|$|Visitation, {{for those}} {{able to make}} the journey, was {{strictly}} controlled by school officials {{in a manner similar to}} the procedures enforced in the prison system. In some cases visitors were altogether denied access to their children, while in others families were required to meet in the presence of school officials and forced to communicate in English. For parents unable to speak the language, verbal communication with their children was impossible. The obstacles families faced to visit their children were further exacerbated by the pass system. Introduced by Reed without legislative authority to do so, the system restricted and closely monitored the movement <b>of</b> <b>Indigenous</b> <b>peoples</b> off reserves. Launched in 1885 as a response to the North-West Rebellion, and later replaced by permits, the system was designed to prevent Indigenous people from leaving reserves without a pass issued by a local Indian agent.|$|E
