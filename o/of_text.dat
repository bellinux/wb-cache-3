40|$|A text can {{be defined}} as a word w {{together}} with a (second) linear order on its domain f 1; :::; jwjg. This second order may be used to define a hierarchical, tree-like, structure representing the <b>text.</b> The family <b>of</b> context-free sets <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> is investigated, i. e., sets <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> defined by context-free text grammars. In particular, those sets <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> are studied in the framework of universal algebra. This allows to compare the classical notions of equational and recognizable families in an algebra with context-free sets in the "algebra of texts". Within this algebra the notion of equational sets coincides with the context-free sets. A grammatical characterization of the family of recognizable sets is given as a subfamily of the context-free sets <b>of</b> <b>texts.</b> 1 Introduction This paper further investigates the class <b>of</b> context-free <b>texts,</b> that was introduced in [9] generalizing context-free word grammars to the setting <b>of</b> <b>texts.</b> The notion <b>of</b> a <b>text</b> itself generalizes the notion of a wor [...] ...|$|R

5|$|The {{basic unit}} of Maya hieroglyphic text is the glyph block, which transcribes {{a word or}} phrase. The block is {{composed}} {{of one or more}} individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block in a piece <b>of</b> <b>text</b> can be identified: C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit <b>of</b> <b>text.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although hieroglyphic text may be {{laid out}} in varying manners, {{generally}} text is arranged into double columns of glyph blocks. The reading order <b>of</b> <b>text</b> starts at the top left (block A1), continues to the second block in the double-column (B1), then drops down a row and starts again from the left half of the double column (A2), and thus continues in zig-zag fashion. Once the bottom is reached, the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column. Where an inscription ends in a single (unpaired) column, this final column is usually read straight downwards.|$|E

Beyond issues of adaptation <b>of</b> <b>text</b> to film, Kiarostami often begins with an insistent will to give visual embodiment to certain specific image-making techniques in Persian poetry, both classical and contemporary, and often ends up enunciating a larger philosophical position, namely the ontological oneness of poetry and film.|$|E
5|$|In Nuskhuri manuscripts, Asomtavruli {{are used}} for titles and {{illuminated}} capitals. The latter were used at the beginnings of paragraphs which started new sections <b>of</b> <b>text.</b> In {{the early stages of}} the development of Nuskhuri texts, Asomtavruli letters were not elaborate and were distinguished principally by size and sometimes by being written in cinnabar ink. Later, from the 10th century, the letters were illuminated. The style of Asomtavruli capitals can be used to identify the era of a text. For example, in the Georgian manuscripts of the Byzantine era, when the styles of the Byzantine Empire influenced Kingdom of Georgia, capitals were illuminated with images of birds and other animals.|$|E

His early sacred works emulate the contrapuntal {{complexity}} and ornamented, melismatic lines of Ockeghem and his contemporaries, {{but at the same time}} he was learning his contrapuntal technique he was acquiring an Italianate idiom for his secular music: after all, he was surrounded by Italian popular music in Milan. By the end of his long creative career, which spanned approximately 50 productive years, he had developed a simplified style in which each voice of a polyphonic composition exhibited free and smooth motion, and close attention was paid to clear setting <b>of</b> <b>text</b> as well as clear alignment <b>of</b> <b>text</b> with musical motifs. While other composers were influential on the development of Josquin's style, especially in the late 15th century, he himself became the most influential composer in Europe, especially after the development of music printing, which was concurrent with the years of his maturity and peak output. This event made his influence even more decisive than it might otherwise have been.|$|E
