5|$|At {{the time}} of Wurster's and Ganzert's visit to the site, the entire bridge was buried by river sediments up to the {{springing}} line of the vaults. No efforts to dig them up were undertaken by Wurster and Ganzert. Only two of the 28 arches were exposed enough so that direct measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clear</b> span and the pier width could be undertaken. It was, however, possible to calculate {{the dimensions of the}} remaining bays from their exposed sections.|$|E

George Wren Howard of Jonathan Cape suggested Bond & the Moonraker, The Moonraker Scare and The Moonraker Plan, while his friend, the writer William Plomer, suggested Hell is Here; the final choice of Moonraker was a suggestion by Wren Howard.|$|E

25|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clear,</b> bold {{nature of}} the large serifs, slab serif designs are often used for posters and in small print. Many monospace fonts, on which all {{characters}} occupy {{the same amount of}} horizontal space as in a typewriter, are slab-serif designs. While not always purely slab-serif designs, many fonts intended for newspaper use have large slab-like serifs for clearer reading on poor-quality paper. Many early slab-serif types, being intended for posters, only come in bold styles with the key differentiation being width, and often have no lower-case letters at all.|$|E

In January 2003, bushfires ravaged the Canberra region and, spreading from Namadgi National Park, devastated much of the flora and bush landscape around Michelago, particularly down from the Clearview Road toward the Murrumbidgee River. While the village itself was not affected by the fires, several farms and houses were destroyed and mountains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clear</b> Range were left blackened and barren. A bushfire which began on 17December 2009 devastated the area east of Michelago, burning out over 9,000 hectares and destroying three homes and a sawmill.|$|E

25|$|Gothic {{architecture}} {{was brought}} to Portugal by the Cistercian Order. The first fully Gothic building in Portugal is {{the church of the}} Monastery of Alcobaça, a magnificent example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clear</b> and simple architectural forms favoured by the Cistercians. The church was built between 1178 and 1252 in three phases, and seems inspired by the Abbey of Clairvaux, in the Champagne. Its three aisles are very tall and slender, giving an exceptional impression of height. The whole church is covered by rib vaulting and the main chapel has an ambulatory and a series of radiant chapels. The vault of the ambulatory is externally supported by flying buttresses, typical features of Gothic architecture and a novelty at the time in Portugal.|$|E
25|$|News of {{the verdict}} drew {{widespread}} comment and criticism in the Scottish press. Such was the level of public and media interest {{in the outcome of}} the case, on 13 September 2007 the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament took the unusual step of allowing the then Lord Advocate, Elish Angiolini, to address parliament on the matter. The Lord Advocate read a prepared statement to the chamber setting out the narrative of the Crown case and explaining her reasoning for deciding to prosecute. She is recorded in the official transcript of her address as saying that she was 'disappointed' with the result, and that she 'was <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clear</b> opinion that the evidence that was made available to the court was sufficient to put before the jury to allow it the opportunity to decide on the case against Sinclair'.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{immediately}} after the recording of Unconditionally Guaranteed, which markedly continued the trend towards a more commercial sound heard on some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clear</b> Spot tracks, the Magic Band's original members departed. Disgruntled and past members worked together for a period, gigging at Blue Lake and putting together their own ideas and demos, with John French earmarked as the vocalist. These concepts eventually coalesced around the core of Art Tripp III, Harkleroad and Boston, {{with the formation of}} Mallard, helped by finance and UK recording facilities from Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson. Some of French's compositions were used in the band's work, but the group's singer was Sam Galpin and the role of keyboardist was eventually taken by John Thomas, who had shared a house with French in Eureka at the time. At this time Vliet attempted to recruit both French and Harkleroad as producers for his next album, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. Andy Di Martino produced both of these Virgin label albums.|$|E

25|$|They land on Schar's World {{and search}} for the Mind in the Command System, a complex of {{subterranean}} train stations.

Horza has kept Balveda alive, and she is taken into the complex. The CATs crew encounter the Idirans in one of the Command System stations, and after a firefight apparently kill one and capture the other. After tracking the Mind to another station, the drone Unaha-Closp discovers it hiding in the reactor car of a Command System train. The second Idiran, who had been mortally wounded but not killed, sets one of the trains for a collision course to the station. The captured Idiran, Xoxarle, frees himself and in the ensuing impact and firefight the remaining members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clear</b> Air Turbulence are killed.

25|$|According to BC's Ecoregion Classification System {{most of the}} Regional District {{is located}} in the Boreal Plains Ecoprovince of the Polar Ecodomain. This area is {{characterized}} by a continental climate with low year-round precipitation. Moist Pacific air loses its precipitation over several mountain ranges before moving over the region, while Arctic air masses are uninterrupted. About 61% of BC's bird species and 46% of all breeding species occur in this ecoprovince. This ecoprovince is divided into four ecosections: the rolling uplands with few ridges and wide valleys <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clear</b> Hills and Halfway Plateau ecosections, the wide plains with deeply incised rivers of the Peace Lowland ecosection, and the rolling uplands and Rocky Mountain foothills of the Kiskatinaw Plateau ecosection. These ecosections have many wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams the area is a major migratory corridor for water- and shorebirds. Moose are the most common large mammal but mule and white-tailed deer, caribou, and elk are also very common. The ecosystem also supports Dall sheep, black bear, grizzly bear, and gray wolf. There are few small mammal or reptile species. Fish species are restricted to freshwater fish like the Arctic grayling, northern pike, and slimy sculpin. Major tree species include white spruce, black spruce, trembling aspen, lodgepole pine, balsam poplar, tamarack, subalpine fir, and paper birch.|$|E
