5000|$|The Bodhisattva [...] "Medicine King" [...] (Bhaishajyaraja) {{chapter of}} the Lotus Sutra was {{associated}} with auto-cremation. In a previous life, 'Medicine King' Bodhisattva burnt his body as a supreme offering to the Buddha. The Lotus Sutra describes the Bodhisattva Sarvarupasamdarsana drinking scented <b>oils,</b> <b>wrapping</b> his body in an oil-soaked cloth, and burning himself. His body flamed for 1,200 years, he was reincarnated, burned off his forearms for 72,000 years, which enabled many to achieve enlightenment, and his arms were miraculously restored.|$|R

40|$|The Barrious <b>Oil</b> <b>Wrapping</b> System (BOWS), a {{commercial}} dietary supplement, was tested. Using in vitro titrimetric assays {{with olive oil}} (100 mg), BOWS caused a 50 % decrease in pancreatic lipase activity between 50 and 75 mg. This is consistent with BOWS blocking the action of lipase by sequestering the oil out of solution. Juvenile rats fed 24 % fat containing 10 % BOWS diets weighed significantly less than rats fed control. Rats fed 10 % fat with 5 or 10 % BOWS had significantly less intraperitoneal fat than rats eating a 10 % fat diet. Rats fed 20 % fat with 15 % BOWS diets gained significantly less weight than rats eating the control diet. BOWS was associated with decreased blood glucose levels suggesting that BOWS could playa role in managing type 2 diabetes. It was concluded that BOWS could be effective in weight loss programs that also include social support and/or satiety maximizing diets...|$|R

40|$|Evaporation of multi-component drops {{is crucial}} to various {{technologies}} and has numerous potential applications because of its ubiquity in nature. Superamphiphobic surfaces, which are both superhydrophobic and superoleophobic, can give a low wettability not only for water drops but also for oil drops. In this paper, we experimentally, numerically and theoretically investigate the evaporation process of millimetric sessile ouzo drops (a transparent mixture of water, ethanol, and trans-anethole) with low wettability on a superamphiphobic surface. The evaporation-triggered ouzo effect, i. e. the spontaneous emulsification of oil microdroplets below a specific ethanol concentration, preferentially occurs {{at the apex of}} the drop due to the evaporation flux distribution and volatility difference between water and ethanol. This observation is also reproduced by numerical simulations. The volume decrease of the ouzo drop is characterized by two distinct slopes. The initial steep slope is dominantly caused by the evaporation of ethanol, followed by the slower evaporation of water. At later stages, thanks to Marangoni forces the <b>oil</b> <b>wraps</b> around the drop and an oil shell forms. We propose an approximate diffusion model for the drying characteristics, which predicts the evaporation of the drops in agreement with experiment and numerical simulation results. This work provides an advanced understanding of the evaporation process of ouzo (multi-component) drops. Comment: 41 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
5000|$|During the Renaissance, {{ultramarine}} was {{the finest}} and most expensive blue {{that could be}} used by painters. The 15th century artist Cennino Cennini wrote in his painters' handbook: [...] "Ultramarine blue is a glorious, lovely and absolutely perfect pigment beyond all the pigments. It would not be possible to say anything about or do anything to it which would not make it more so." [...] Natural ultramarine is the most difficult pigment to grind by hand, and for all except the highest quality of mineral, sheer grinding and washing produces only a pale grayish blue powder. At the beginning of the 13th century, an improved method came into use, described by Cennino Cennini in the 15th century. This process consisted of mixing the ground material with melted wax, resins, and <b>oils,</b> <b>wrapping</b> the resulting mass in a cloth, and then kneading it in a dilute lye solution. The blue particles collect {{at the bottom of the}} pot, while the impurities and colorless crystals remain. This process was performed at least three times, with each successive extraction generating a lower quality material. The final extraction, consisting largely of colorless material as well as a few blue particles, brings forth ultramarine ash which is prized as a glaze for its pale blue transparency.|$|R
40|$|The {{province}} of Alberta contains the natural resource oil sand. Demaison (1977) described the Alberte tar sands as “the world largest selfcontained accumulation of hydrocarbons”. 1. 7 to 2. 5 trillion {{barrels of oil}} are trapped in a complex mixture of sand, water and clay. This oil sand deposit is primarily located in and around Fort McMurray. The McMurray Formation is a lower Cretaceous oil-bearing quartz sandstone. Much of this <b>oil</b> is <b>wrapped</b> as a coationg around individual, water wet sand grains, so the extraction problem is not of getting the oil {{out of the sand}} but of getting the sand out of the oil (North 1985) ...|$|R

The small number of German bombs, also known as firebombs, were finned containers filled with kerosene and <b>oil</b> and <b>wrapped</b> with tar-covered rope. They were dropped from Zeppelin airships. On 8 September 1915, Zeppelin L-13 dropped a large number of firebombs, but even then the results were poor and they were generally ineffective in terms of the damage inflicted. They did, however, have a considerable effect on the morale of the civilian population of the United Kingdom.|$|R

5000|$|Bosch {{carried a}} Smith & Wesson Model 5906 9mm semiautomatic pistol as his duty weapon for many years. The S&W Model 5906 is {{authorized}} by the LAPD for duty carry by its officers. It was a popular weapon in the LAPD prior to the North Hollywood shootout. He kept a Heckler & Koch P7 9mm semiautomatic pistol at his house, in the front closet <b>wrapped</b> in an <b>oil</b> <b>wrap,</b> as a back-up weapon. When {{he retired from the}} police department, he carried a Glock 27 [...]40 Caliber semiautomatic subcompact pistol. When he returned to active duty with the LAPD, he started to carry a Kimber Ultra Carry II [...]45 ACP Caliber semiautomatic pistol. Many officers in the LAPD started carrying [...]45 caliber pistols after the North Hollywood Shootout bank robbery incident. The LAPD authorized the heavier caliber pistol ammunition for its officers in response to officers facing heavily armed bandits in the North Hollywood shootout. In [...] "The Burning Room", Bosch starts carrying a Glock 30, [...]45 ACP caliber, semiautomatic pistol. He still kept the Kimber [...]45 as his second pistol but uses the Glock as his duty weapon.

It was kept at home, but he took it with him on his trip to Mexico to have a gun which he could check at the border crossing so as to show he had not carried it into Mexico. That done, he hid his carry gun, the 9mm S&W pistol, under the spare tire of his Chevy Caprice. The cop at the border station observed that the left-handed Harry was checking in a right-handed revolver.|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} long distance transport of ovine oocytes and in vitro produced embryos. Santa Ines pluriparous sheep (n= 5) were synchronized with intravaginal devices containing 0. 3 mg progesterone (CIDR®, Pfizer, Netherlands) for 10 days. Thirty-six hours prior to progesterone device removal and follicular aspiration, 0. 04 mg d-cloprostenol sodium (Ciosin®, Coopers, Brasil), 200 IU FSH (Folltropin®, Bioniche, Canada) and 300 IU eCG (Novormon®, Syntex, Argentina) were administered intramuscularly. Oocyte retrieval was performed via mid-ventral laparotomy, under general anesthesia. The oocytes were evaluated and classified under a stereomicroscope and placed in cryovials with TCM 199, aerated with 5 % CO 2, covered with mineral <b>oil,</b> sealed, <b>wrapped</b> with parafilm and stored in a transport incubator at 38. 5 °C. Oocytes were then transported via the road for 14 h to the laboratory, where the oocytes then completed more than 10 h of IVM. In vitro fertilization (IVF) was performed with frozen sperm from a single ram. On Day 3 the embryos were placed in cryovials containing SOFovine (In Vitro Brasil, Sao Paulo, Brazil), aerated with 5 % CO 2, covered with mineral <b>oil,</b> sealed, <b>wrapped</b> with parafilm and placed into the same portable incubator. The embryos were returned to the farm under the same transport conditions (km and h). Upon arrival at the farm, all embryos were evaluated and transferred into recipient ewes 4 days after the initial oocyte retrieval. Embryos were transferred in sets of 3 to 4, into {{the apex of the}} uterine horn, ipsilateral to the corpus luteum, by means of mid-ventral laparotomy, under general anesthesia. Pregnancy was diagnosed using transrectal ultrasonography 30 days after embryo transfer. On average 9. 8 ± 5. 7 oocytes (49 oocytes/ 5 donors) were obtained per donor, and 25 grade I morulae were transferred into 7 recipients. One pregnancy (14. 3 %) was confirmed resulting in a healthy lamb. These results indicate the feasibility of in vitro embryo production in sheep after maturation and embryonic development following transport over long distances...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{material}} called [...] "duck tape" [...] {{was long}} strips of plain cotton duck cloth used in making shoes stronger, for decoration on clothing, and for wrapping steel cables or electrical conductors {{to protect them}} from corrosion or wear. For instance, in 1902, steel cables supporting the Manhattan Bridge were first covered in linseed <b>oil</b> then <b>wrapped</b> in duck tape before being laid in place. In the 1910s, certain boots and shoes used canvas duck fabric for the upper or for the insole, and duck tape was sometimes sewn in for reinforcement. In 1936, the US-based Insulated Power Cables Engineers Association specified a wrapping of duck tape as one of many methods used to protect rubber-insulated power cables. In 1942, Gimbel's department store offered venetian blinds that were held together with vertical strips of duck tape. All of these foregoing uses were for plain cotton or linen tape that came without a layer of applied adhesive.|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} {{petroleum}} hydrocarbons {{have been used}} in horticulture. The most important applications have been in the field of economic entomology and emulsions of petroleum hydrocarbons are widely employed for the control of insect pests such as scale insects and acarine mites. Such emulsions are widely used on citrus, on dormant deciduous trees, and deciduous trees in various stages of development. Hydrocarbons with different physical properties are required for these different applications, depending on the requirements for safety, efficiency, and their provision at a minimum cost. There have, however, been other applications in which physiological results are sought. It has been the practice of many apple growers to apply emulsified petroleum hydrocarbons to stimulate the break of dormancy in the trees in spring. Similarly sprays of petroleum hydrocarbons have been used with a view to "waterproofing" cherries near maturity, so that in the event of rain, the absorption of water is limited, and the ensuing cracking of fruit is reduced. Yet again, there are useful applications in the storage of fruit. "Superficial scald" of Granny Smith apples is eliminated by using <b>oiled</b> <b>wraps,</b> while wilting of other fruits such as apples and all kinds of citrus in storage, is delayed by means of films of petroleum hydrocarbons. Two research projects in these fields with which the writer has been concerned over the period 1940 - 44 inclusive, are described below. They have been confined in the main to Victoria, but conditioned in many details by knowledge of horticultural problems in other States and directed towards an Australian wide application. The work falls logically into two sections - (1) Physiological - The application of emulsified petroleum hydrocarbons to vines, with a view to delaying the breaking of dormancy, thus passing the period of maximum frost liability in the dormant condition. (2) Insecticidal - The development of an insecticidal composition consisting essentially of dinitrocresol dissolved in petroleum hydrocarbons, and its possible applications to Australian horticulture. The former section was investigated by the writer in conjunction with officers of the C. S. I. R., Merbein; notably Mr. D. V. "'alters. The writer played a major part in the planning and performance of the trial, and the estimation and examination of results, but it cannot be claimed as individual research. The latter section was entirely planned and carried out by the writer and has {{led to the development of}} a horticultural insecticide which has been applied commercially for several years with success.

6000|$|The {{conclusion}} {{of the story of}} Cronus runs thus:--He wedded his sister, Rhea, and begat children--Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and, lastly, Zeus. 'And mighty Cronus swallowed down each of them, each that came to their mother's knees from her holy womb, with this intent, that none other of the proud children of Uranus should hold kingly sway among the Immortals.' Cronus showed a ruling father's usual jealousy of his heirs. It was a case of Friedrich Wilhelm and Friedrich. But Cronus (acting in a way natural in a story perhaps first invented by cannibals) swallowed his children instead of merely imprisoning them. Heaven and Earth had warned him to beware of his heirs, and he could think of no safer plan than that which he adopted. When Rhea was about to become the mother of Zeus, she fled to Crete. Here Zeus was born, and when Cronus (in pursuit of his usual policy) asked for the baby, he was presented with a stone wrapped up in swaddling bands. After swallowing the stone, Cronus was easy in his mind; but Zeus grew up, administered a dose to his father, and compelled him to disgorge. 'The stone came forth first, as he had swallowed it last.' {52a} [...] The other children also emerged, all alive and well. Zeus fixed the stone at Delphi, where, long after the Christian era, Pausanias saw it. {52b} It was not a large stone, Pausanias tells us, and the Delphians used to anoint it with <b>oil</b> and <b>wrap</b> it up in wool on feast-days. All Greek temples had their fetich-stones, and each stone had its legend. This was the story of the Delphian stone, and of the fetichism which survived the early years of Christianity. A very pretty story it is. Savages more frequently smear their fetich-stones with red paint than daub them with oil, but the latter, as we learn from Theophrastus's account of the 'superstitious man,' was the Greek ritual.|$|R
40|$|The {{fixation}} {{mechanism of}} copper chrome arsenate wood preservative is investigated. Parameters examined, include: pressure, solution temperature, solution strength, second stage treatment {{with water and}} oil, initial vacuum and timber pack design. The influence of these parameters is determined by analysing; basic density, penetration, preservative retention and leaching characteristics. Legislative leachate levels are also investigated. The timber used in the trials is kiln dried, structural grade F 5 heartwood and sapwood of Pinus radiata D. Don. Radiata pine roundwood is also used. Two pilot scale treatment plants are utilised during the trials. Processes conducted, are the modified Bethell, Lowry and Alternating Pressure Method (APM). Simulated rainfall is applied to every timber pack after treatment. Significant differences between percentage leachates resulting from the timber packs, {{are determined by the}} Friedman test and multiple comparison analysis. Investigation of leachate concentrations revealed no world legislative standard. Concentration of copper leachate was suggested as a way to monitor leaching in the aquatic environment. In the soil environment, concentration of chromium leachate was recommended. Heartwood penetration was improved and leachate concentration was decreased when the treating pressure was increased. Concentration of chromium and copper leachate also appeared to decrease when the solution temperature was increased. In contrast, at the higher temperatures, the concentration of arsenic leachate increased. Chromium leachate concentration also decreased when solution strength was increased in Lowry or APM treatment of roundwood. A similar trend was noted when treated timber was subjected to a second stage treatment that involved water or <b>oil.</b> A plastic <b>wrap</b> applied to the timber pack also reduced the concentration of chromium leachate. Chromium leachate concentration and heartwood penetration were influenced by the alteration of the initial vacuum in modified Bethell treatment. Heartwood penetration was improved when low pressure treatment was conducted using the Lowry process, rather than the modified Bethell process.
