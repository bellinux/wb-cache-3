5|$|After being {{disgusted with}} the state of the Square and {{learning}} that a councillor has stood down, Peggy and Pat both decide to run for council and are interviewed by journalist Harvey Freeman (Martin Jarvis). Eventually they both pull out of the election, but Harvey hears of this and individually invites them both out. They both finally discover his two-timing, and humiliate him in punishment. When Phil prevents his daughter Louise (Brittany Papple) from contacting her mother Lisa (Lucy Benjamin), Peggy interjects and Phil punches her. Believing he is an unfit parent, Peggy takes Louise to Lisa against Phil's wishes. Although, Lisa promises to allow Phil visitation, she flees with Louise. Phil blames Peggy for the loss of his child and begins using alcohol and crack cocaine. Peggy tries to stop Phil using crack by locking him in her pub, but Phil escapes and in a drunken bid for revenge, he sets fire to Peggy's pub. Peggy watches in horror as it is destroyed. Realising her role in Phil's problems, Peggy decides to leave Walford for his sake. After saying tearful goodbyes to her family and making peace with Phil, Peggy takes <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at The Queen Vic and leaves Albert Square.|$|E
25|$|In the 2003 revival {{starring}} Bernadette Peters, {{the final}} dialogue scene remains, but leaves the ending open to more interpretation from the audience. Louise {{walks through the}} stage door, with Rose following behind. Rose then turns to face the audience, a look of sadness and longing on {{her face as she}} takes <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the empty stage. She pauses and slowly closes the door.|$|E
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{felt that}} the episode was [...] "a decent if uneven {{penultimate}} episode that gave us <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at this quirky {{group of people in}} their office environment". He was largely happy with the return of the fun-loving version of Jim, noting that [...] "Pam mentioned that she loves 'Goofy Jim' and I, [...] have to admit, I love Goofy Jim myself". Campbell {{felt that the}} episode dabbled in fan service, but that it was expected and needed for the show to have a successful ending. Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, denoting a [...] "great" [...] episode. She wrote that [...] "The interplay between Jim, Dwight, and Pam has been the core of the series since Michael Scott's departure, and it was good to see the trio front and center once again as The Office comes to a close." [...] Furthermore, Cornet was happy with Dwight's proposal and the dance party that signaled Darryl's leaving, calling the latter [...] "a slice of bliss".|$|E
60|$|They took <b>one</b> <b>last,</b> long <b>look</b> {{into each}} others' eyes. Jim's glance betrayed his fear--he {{would never see}} his brother again. The light in Joe's eyes was the old steely flash, the indomitable spirit--while there was life there was hope.|$|R
6000|$|... "In dreams we smile," [...] she answered. [...] "And {{now it is}} time; follow thou me. Be {{firm and}} prosper, royal Harmachis!" [...] and bending forward she {{took my hand and}} kissed it. Then, with <b>one</b> strange <b>last</b> <b>look,</b> she turned and led the way down the stair and through the empty halls.|$|R
50|$|Winter’s first {{short story}} collection, Creaking in Their Skins, was {{published}} in 1994. In 1999, editor John Metcalf at The Porcupine's Quill published his second book of stories, <b>One</b> <b>Last</b> Good <b>Look.</b> Winter moved to Toronto in 1999, where he published his first two novels: This All Happened (2000) and The Big Why (2004).|$|R
500|$|Jim (John Krasinski) deduces {{over the}} course of the day that Michael is leaving early and confronts him about it. Michael admits his plans, and begins a {{personal}} goodbye, but breaks down after a few words. Jim, trying to hold back tears, in turn says how much he respects Michael, and that Michael was the best boss he ever had and they jokingly promise to have a proper goodbye over lunch the next day. Michael's cab to the airport then arrives, and Michael departs the office after <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the employees, exiting silently. His cab pulls out of the parking lot just as Pam is pulling in. At the airport, Michael asks the camera crew to inform him if the documentary ever airs, then turns over his microphone, quipping one last [...] "That's what she said" [...] about how good it will feel to [...] "get this thing [...] off [...] chest". He begins to walk off when Pam makes it past security and runs up to him. They hug twice and say goodbyes that are not heard by the camera. Pam says in an interview that Michael was not sad, that he was hopeful and excited to start his new life with Holly. Pam stands at the gate and watches Michael's plane take off.|$|E
2500|$|Alice {{arrives and}} takes the wine, and sees through Annabel's offer almost immediately. With Annabel refusing to offer any more, Miriam, in {{apparent}} desperation, suggests Lewis could find the money. Alice scorns this too, and, before leaving {{to go to the}} Police, stops to tell Miriam has one hell of a sister ... but before she can finish, she collapses. Miriam says she drugged the wine (her own glass having come from a different bottle in the kitchen), and a horrified Annabel watches her push Alice's body through the trapdoor and down the well. Next, she goes through Alice's handbag looking for the letter. It is not there, but her address and keys are, so she persuades Annabel to come with her to get the letter. Before Annabel leaves, she takes <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the tennis court, a tennis ball flies out of nowhere, and she screams.|$|E
60|$|Her {{face was}} white and her eyes terror-stricken. She obeyed him mechanically. She gave <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at those bodies....|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will come}} Friday evening, Uncle Jethro," [...] she said, as {{she kissed him}} and gave <b>one</b> <b>last,</b> {{lingering}} <b>look</b> at his face. Had it been possible, {{she would not have}} left him, and on her way to Brampton through the gathering darkness she mused anxiously upon that strange calmness he had shown after defeat.|$|R
5000|$|Logan {{moved on}} to Parker Lee, while Veronica {{did the same with}} Stosh [...] "Piz" [...] Piznarski. Veronica vows never to speak to Logan again after he violently beats up Piz, believing Piz emailed a racy video of himself and Veronica all over Hearst. However, the series ended with Logan and Veronica sharing <b>one</b> <b>last</b> {{ambiguous}} <b>look,</b> leaving their relationship unresolved.|$|R
6000|$|And Duhl {{was wise}} at the word, and Muléykeh as prompt {{perceived}} [...] Who was urging redoubled pace, {{and to hear}} him was to obey, [...] And a leap indeed gave she, and evanished for evermore. [...] And Hóseyn <b>looked</b> <b>one</b> long <b>last</b> <b>look</b> as who, all bereaved, [...] 100 [...] Looks, fain to follow the dead {{so far as the}} living may; [...] Then he turned Buhéyseh's neck slow homeward, weeping sore.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Wetzel's terrible temptation, his heart-racking {{struggle}} ceased. He {{lowered the}} long, black rifle. He took <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the chieftain's dark, powerful face.|$|E
60|$|Harding hesitated. He glanced savagely at Smoke, saw Pierre beckoning to Louis {{from the}} doorway, took <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the lump-gold on the table, and decided.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a {{girl with}} a noble heart--" [...] Madame threw her arms round Alvina's neck, and kissed her. Alvina felt very cool about it. Madame locked up the jewels quickly, after <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{meal was}} all over in an {{incredibly}} short time. One by one, two by two, they rose heavily and lumbered out with <b>one</b> <b>last</b> wistful <b>look</b> at Mrs. Field. She will never know how seraphic she seemed sitting there amid those rough surroundings--the dim red light of the kerosene lamp falling across her clear pallor, out of which her dark eyes shone with liquid softness, made deeper and darker by her half-sorrowful tenderness for these homeless fellows.|$|R
60|$|All {{this being}} done, Beatrice visited {{the kitchen and}} ordered the supper. She went further in her {{innocent}} cunning. Betty {{asked her what she}} would like for breakfast on the following morning, and she told her to cook some bacon, and to be careful how she cut it, as she did not like thick bacon. Then, after <b>one</b> long <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the Vicarage, she started for the lodging of the head teacher of the school, and, having found her, inquired as to the day's work.|$|R
60|$|Captain Truck {{had never}} before been so deeply {{impressed}} with any religious ceremony, and when it ceased he looked wistfully over the side at the spot where the body had fallen, or where it might be supposed to have fallen--- for the ship had drifted some distance--as <b>one</b> takes a <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the grave of a friend.|$|R
60|$|Sonorous and startling {{came the}} stroke of 9 from the clock tower. The young man sighed again, turned his face for <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> {{at the house of}} his relinquished hopes--and cried aloud profane words of holy rapture.|$|E
60|$|The train passed {{smoothly}} {{out of the}} station. Sally cast <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> back at her red-haired friend, who had now halted and {{was waving}} a handkerchief. Then she turned to apologize to the other occupant of the carriage.|$|E
60|$|Therefore, now {{she took}} her father's arm once more: she turned resolutely to go. One more curt nod of the head, <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> of undying enmity, {{and then she would}} pass finally out of his life for ever.|$|E
60|$|She pulled hurriedly at {{the handle}} of the hoarse old bell, and the gate soon opened. Before going in, she gave him <b>one</b> <b>last,</b> wide, {{wondering}} <b>look,</b> as if she would have asked him with imploring emphasis: ‘O! don’t you understand?’ And out of that look he vanished from her view.|$|R
6000|$|And {{fighting}} {{the battle of}} life is fighting against fearful odds, too. There are giants and dragons in this nineteenth century, and the golden casket that they guard {{is not so easy}} to win as it appears in the story-books. There, Algernon takes <b>one</b> long, <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the ancestral hall, dashes the tear-drop from his eye, and goes off--to return in three years' time, rolling in riches. The authors do not tell us [...] "how it's done," [...] which is a pity, for it would surely prove exciting.|$|R
5000|$|Eli then {{revealed}} {{himself to}} be the thief, before apologising to Sam. He left before he could be arrested and Marlon followed him, begging his brother not to leave on bad terms. The two had an emotional discussion about their childhood before Marlon kissed his brother goodbye. Eli returned the cash box to Marlon, which was later discovered to be empty apart from a note which read [...] "IOU £400". Eli was last seen leaving the village. He took <b>one</b> <b>last</b> tearful <b>look</b> back, then turned and walked away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't bother about me!" [...] Harry replied; {{and then}} as the flames came nearer he plunged into the sea, Joe {{lingering}} a few seconds longer, as if to take <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the little craft he had {{tried so hard to}} save.|$|E
60|$|They {{thanked him}} for this kindness, and when they had once more settled upon the limb beside their nest the bluejay also bade them good night and darted away for <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> through the forest to see that all was orderly for the night.|$|E
60|$|As the cavalcade {{turned the}} corner of the mountain, they paused for <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the scene of that fearful triumph. Lines of {{vultures}} were already streaming out of infinite space, as if created suddenly for the occasion. A few hours {{and there would be no}} trace of that fierce fray, but a few white bones amid untrodden beds of flowers.|$|E
60|$|She paused {{as if for}} an answer. I {{had none}} for her. I raised my arms, then let them fall again, and bowed my head. I heard the gentle rustle of her robe, and I {{looked up to see}} her {{staggering}} towards the door, her arms in front of her like one who is blind. She reached it, pulled it open, and from the threshold gave me <b>one</b> <b>last</b> ineffable <b>look</b> of her great eyes, heavy now with tears. Then the door closed again, and I was alone.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} a {{carriage}} has driven up to convey the bride to church, and Anne of number six prolonging the process of 'cleaning her door,' has the satisfaction of beholding the bride and bridesmaids, and the papa and mamma, hurry into the same and drive rapidly off. Nor is this all, for soon other carriages begin to arrive with a posse of company all beautifully dressed, at whom she could stand and gaze for ever; but having something else to do, is compelled to take <b>one</b> <b>last</b> long <b>look</b> and shut the street-door.|$|R
60|$|The sudden, {{intolerable}} {{sense of}} wrong {{done to her}} love, the swift anger which followed it, the justness of her claim of him who now lay in the dignity of death clothed her--who in life had been crushed and blotted out--with a dignity not to be gainsaid. In this moment of final self-assertion she became the dominating person in the room, knew for once the birthright of human worth. They watched her in silence as she turned and gave <b>one</b> <b>last,</b> lingering <b>look</b> at {{the features of the}} dead; stretched out her hand towards them, but did not touch them... and then went slowly towards the door. Beside Alison she stopped.|$|R
60|$|As {{he passed}} over the {{drawbridge}} and down toward the highroad {{a few minutes later}} {{on his way back to}} Torn, he turned for <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the castle and there, in an embrasure in the south tower, stood a young woman who raised her hand to wave, and then, as though by sudden impulse, threw a kiss after the departing knight, only to disappear from the embrasure with the act.|$|E
60|$|As it was when, from sheer lack of breath, {{he had to}} pause, he gave <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> of hate on the huddled {{figure of}} the duc, and the proud, {{upstanding}} one of Yvonne, then with a laugh which sounded {{like that of a}} fiend--so cruel, so callous was it, he turned on his heel, and as he strode away towards the bow his tall figure was soon absorbed in the surrounding gloom.|$|E
60|$|Not {{till they}} reached {{the opening of the}} gorge did they stop to rest and take <b>one</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> at the valley. The {{tremendous}} arch of stone curved clear and sharp in outline against the morning sky. And through it streaked the golden shaft. The valley seemed an enchanted circle of glorious veils of gold and wraiths of white and silver haze and dim, blue, moving shade--beautiful and wild and unreal as a dream.|$|E
5000|$|The Yangs {{now believe}} Kirk is a deity and Cloud kneels before him, but Kirk refutes this {{and tells him}} to stand up. He looks over the ancient, {{crumbling}} document, {{which appears to be}} a version of the American Constitution. Kirk finishes the sacred speech (the Preamble to the United States Constitution) and rebukes the Yangs for allowing the document to degrade. He declares that the words were not just for the Yangs, but for Kohms, as well, declaring that they [...] "must apply to everyone or they mean nothing." [...] Cloud doesn't fully understand, but swears to Kirk that the [...] "holy words" [...] will be obeyed. Before departing, Kirk takes <b>one</b> <b>last</b> proud <b>look</b> at Old Glory.|$|R
6000|$|Then the Mulla-mulgars {{cut down}} stout boughs to make cudgels, and, having tied up their few {{possessions}} into three bundles and filled their pockets with old nuts, they took palm-leaves and honey-comb and withered scarlet and green berries, {{with which they}} canopied {{as best they could}} their mother's grave, nor forgot poor gluttonous Glint's. They stood there in the snow, and raised their hands in lamentable salutation. And each took up a stone and jerked it (for they cannot throw as men do) {{as far as he could}} towards the forest, as if to say, [...] "Go with us!" [...] Then, with <b>one</b> <b>last</b> sorrowful <b>look</b> at the befrosted ashes of their hut, they took up their bundles and started on their journey.|$|R
60|$|And Martin-Roget, {{the weaker}} morally of the two, yielded to the {{stronger}} personality of his colleague. He {{would have liked}} to stay on for awhile, to gloat for a few moments longer over the helplessness of the woman who to him represented the root of every evil which had ever befallen him and his family. But Chauvelin commanded and he felt impelled to obey. He gave <b>one</b> long, <b>last</b> <b>look</b> on Yvonne--a look that was as full of triumph as of mockery--he looked round the four dank walls, the unglazed window, the broken pitcher, the mouldy bread. Revenge was of a truth the sweetest emotion of the human heart. Pierre Adet--son of the miller who had been hanged by orders of the Duc de Kernogan for a crime which he had never committed--would not at this moment have changed places with Fortune's Benjamin.|$|R
