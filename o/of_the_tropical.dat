5|$|The Indian Ocean Dipole is an atmospheric–oceanic {{phenomenon}} {{characterized by}} differences in sea surface temperatures between {{the eastern and}} western sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> Indian Ocean. Similar to the Antarctic Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. In the positive phase, the eastern section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> Indian Ocean is cooler (lower sea surface temperature) and the western section is warmer than normal (higher sea surface temperature). On the other hand, the negative phase is characterized by warmer sea surface temperatures on the eastern section and cooler sea surface temperatures on the western section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> Indian Ocean. Studies {{have shown that the}} Indian Ocean Dipole is partly responsible for variations in precipitation in Argentina and South America in general. During a positive phase, precipitation is higher in the Río de la Plata Basin due to teleconnections.|$|E
5|$|Bret was {{the first}} of six {{tropical}} cyclones (three hurricanes, two of them major, and three tropical storms) to make landfall in Mexico during the season. With the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> storm on June 28, the 2005 season became the first since 1986 with two storms in the month of June. The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at 266mm (10.67inches), which caused flooding and one drowning death. About 7,500people were affected, and damage totaled over 100million pesos (2005MXN, $9.3million 2005USD, $10.3million 2008USD).|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Arthur {{became a}} {{tropical}} storm on July 24, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued for Trinidad, Tobago, and Grenada; six hours later, it was extended to the Grenadines. About 24 hours later, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> storm warnings were discontinued. As Arthur headed further into the Caribbean Sea, a tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for Hispaniola and Puerto Rico on July 26. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> storm watches and warnings were discontinued after Arthur weakened to a tropical depression. After Arthur made landfall on Tobago, several landslides occurred, and a major bridge had collapsed; electrical and water services were significantly disrupted. Damage was also reported on Grenada, where two bridges were damaged, electricity and telephone service was disrupted, and crops were affected as well. In addition, Arthur caused damage to four hotels and hundreds of houses. Wind gusts {{on the island of}} Grenada reportedly reached 55mph (85km/h). As Arthur passed south of Puerto Rico, there were reports of strong winds and heavy rainfall. Heavy rainfall was also reported on the south coast of Haiti as Arthur approached the country.|$|E

5|$|Strong shear {{associated}} with the outflow of Cyclone Olaf caused all convection {{associated with}} Nancy to be displaced to the southwest on February16. Early on February17, Nancy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it entered the area of responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tropical</b> cyclone warning centre (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. Shortly after, the low was absorbed into the larger circulation of Olaf. However, TCWC Wellington continued to monitor Nancy as a separate system until 1200UTC on February18.|$|E

5|$|The season {{produced}} 16tropical depressions, {{of which}} 14 intensified into tropical storms, 8became hurricanes, and 1became a major hurricane. Although the season {{had the highest}} number of named storms at the time, it featured only two notable storms, primarily because many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> cyclones remained either weak or at sea. The two most significant storms of the season, in terms of damage and loss of life, were Hurricane Diana and Tropical Storm Marco. However, the strongest tropical cyclone of the season was Hurricane Gustav.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Nine-E was {{influenced}} by a high pressure area located over Mexico, causing it to move 16mph (26km/h) to the north-west. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Hernan overnight as the storm became more organized. Although Hernan was located over warm waters, moderate wind shear prevented the storm from intensifying quickly, and the storm slowed. Hernan slowly became better organized throughout the night, but wind shear continued to impair Hernan through the morning; as a result, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> cyclone forecast models did not predict Hernan to become a hurricane.|$|E

5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa, on September7. The system passed south of Cape Verde on September8, with disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Around that time, the National Hurricane Center gave the system a medium chance of tropical cyclogenesis within 48hours. A low pressure area developed along the axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> wave on September9, which caused convective activity to increase further. The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September10. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the National Hurricane Center declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200UTC on September10, while located about 885miles (1,425km) west of Cape Verde.|$|E
5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
5|$|At Valencia {{and other}} regions of eastern Spain, the storm {{generated}} heavy precipitation, while six tornadoes touched down over the Balearic Islands. While approaching {{the coast of the}} Balearic Islands, the warm-core low induced a pressure drop of 11mbar (0.32inHg) at Palma, Majorca in advance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> cyclone's landfall. Medicanes as small as the one that formed in September1996 are atypical, and often require circumstances different even from those required for regular Mediterranean tropical cyclone formation. Warm low-level advection–transfer of heat through air or sea–caused by a large-scale low over the western Mediterranean was a primary factor in the rise of strong convection. The presence of a mid- to upper-level cut-off cold-core low, a method of formation typical to medicanes, was also key to the development of intense thunderstorms within the cyclone. In addition, interaction between a northeastward-drifting trough, the medicane, and the large-scale also permitted the formation of tornadoes within thunderstorms generated by the cyclone after making landfall.|$|E

5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> depression, forecasters issued a tropical storm warning for parts of the Texas coast. When the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay, the warnings were extended from Matagorda, Texas to coastal Louisiana. On September 8, forecasters extended the warnings to Port Aransas, Texas, and areas from Port O'Connor to High Island, Texas were put under a hurricane watch as the storm was forecast to reach hurricane strength before making landfall. However, the hurricane watch for those areas were discontinued when Fay failed to reach hurricane strength. In addition, coastal Texas as well as coastal Louisiana were under a coastal flood warning, while parts of inland Texas were under flash flood warnings and flood warnings.|$|E
5|$|During this season, {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone formed on March 16, {{and the last}} one dissipated on December 12. A total of 29 tropical depressions formed this year in the Western Pacific, of which 25 became tropical storms. 19 storms reached typhoon intensity, of which 2 reached super typhoon strength. Two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> cyclones formed between July and October. Typhoon Pamela was the longest-lived tropical cyclone of the season. Sixteen of the cyclones struck land during their life cycles, with eight moving through the Philippines. Tropical cyclones accounted for 35percent of the 1982 rainfall across Hong Kong, their fifth wettest tropical cyclone contribution on record at the time. Nearly half of the deaths during the season were the result of Typhoon Nancy moving through the Philippines and Vietnam in October.|$|E

In the official Pacific hurricane database, Ekeka was the second tropical cyclone on record to occur in January or February within the Pacific Ocean east of the International Date Line, after Tropical Storm Winona of 1989. It is third earliest cyclone on record within the basin, behind Hurricane Pali of 2016, and the aforementioned Winona.|$|E
