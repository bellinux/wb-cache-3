5|$|In 1978, the Astronomy Department of Case Western Reserve University made a {{deal with}} the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) to build a new {{observatory}} at Kitt Peak National Observatory to house the Burrell Schmidt. The telescope was moved from Ohio to Arizona in May 1979, and in 1980 the 36-inch reflector on Taylor Road was moved to the Nassau Station. This meant no further astronomical work was done at the Taylor Road facility, and as a result the faculty and resources of the original observatory were moved to the main campus of Case Western Reserve University in 1982. The Taylor Road facility was sold in 1983, was abandoned, and remained neglected until 2005 when it was sold to a couple who planned to convert the building into a residence. The plans stalled when its new owner was convicted <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> fraud and sent to prison in 2007.|$|E

The kind of contract modification performed by the law in question was arguably similar to the kind that the Framers intended to prohibit.

25|$|The current {{federal income}} tax law allows {{individuals}} to deduct the home mortgage interest costs from taxable income (unless the taxpayer {{is subject to the}} Alternative Minimum Tax). Home mortgage interest {{is one of the few}} personal expenditures that is treated in this manner. Someone paying a 25% income tax rate would receive $250 back from the government for $1,000 expended in home mortgage interest. While there is no deduction for payroll taxes and most do not itemize the income tax deduction for full benefit, this preferential treatment <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> interest encourages households to spend relatively more of their income on housing than would otherwise be the case.|$|E
25|$|In many countries, {{it is not}} {{feasible}} for banks to lend at fixed rates for very long terms; in these cases, the only feasible type <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> for banks to offer may be adjustable rate mortgages (barring some form of government intervention). For example, the mortgage industry of the United Kingdom has traditionally been dominated by building societies. Since funds raised by UK building societies {{must be at least}} 50% deposits, lenders prefer variable-rate mortgages to fixed-rate mortgages to reduce potential interest rate risks between what they charging in mortgage interest and what they are paying in interest for deposits and other funding sources.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{meltdown}} of {{the subprime}} mortgage industry in March 2007, Schumer proposed {{a federal government}} bailout of subprime borrowers {{in order to save}} homeowners from losing their residences and to shore up communities that were seeing neighborhoods destabilized due to foreclosures and the resulting decreases in neighboring home values. As part of a package of regulatory reforms that Schumer has pushed in response to the subprime foreclosure crisis, he called for the creation <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> industry regulators to protect borrowers from deceptive lending practices and called for the Securities and Exchange Commission to relocate from Washington to New York so that it was in closer proximity to the industry it was charged with overseeing.|$|E
