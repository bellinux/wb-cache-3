40|$|Ovine {{ricotta cheese}} is a {{traditional}} Sicilian dairy product characterised by high humidity and a short shelf life (2 - 4 days when refrigerated). The increasing demand for fresh food has prompted manufacturers to develop special packaging techniques, such as modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), that can extend the shelf life and maintain the <b>organoleptic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of ovine ricotta cheese. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the shelf life of fresh MAP-packed ovine ricotta cheese by monitoring the microbiological, chemical, physical and <b>organoleptic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the product. Samples of a single batch were packed in MAP or vacuum packed and stored at 4 °C for 24 and 7 days, respectively. Water activity, pH, physicochemical parameters and microbiological characteristics were examined. A sensory panel rated the product’s main <b>organoleptic</b> <b>characteristics</b> (colour, odour, flavour and texture). Results showed that MAP controlled the development of any unwanted microflora, but did not affect the development of intrinsic lactic floras or chemical parameters. Sensory analysis revealed that overall the MAP-packed ricotta remained acceptable for up to 15 days of storage. The vacuum-packed ricotta cheese, however, showed a progressive deterioration in <b>organoleptic</b> <b>characteristics</b> from day 5 onward and therefore had a shorter shelf life. In conclusion, the ability of MAP to extend the shelf life of a traditional regional product (such as fresh ovine ricotta cheese) guarantees consumers a quality product and provides opportunities for manufacturers to expand their markets beyond national boundaries...|$|E

The 118 factory-made spreads analyzed were characterized by generally low microbial counts (lower than 103 cfu-g"), while the 98 artisanal products showed a high variability in microbiological quality, with total aer-obic mesophilic counts often exceeding 105 cfu·g- 1 • From a qualitative point of view, coliforms, S. aureus and Gram negative psychrotrophs were isolated only in artisanal samples. Spore-forming bacteria, yeasts and moulds were isolated from both types of products but they were observed in higher percentages and with higher values in artisanal ones. The results of our study seem to confirm that the application of a well-standardized and mechanized procedure, which minimizes the manual handling of the product, combined with proper hygiene practices during manufacturing helps {{to reduce the risk of}} developing food safety and/or spoilage problems in this kind of dairy products. © Inra/Elsevier, Paris.
