About 20% <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> well and a few recover completely. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness are common. The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is ten to twenty-five years less than for the general population. This {{is the result of}} increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate (about 5%). In 2015 an estimated 17,000 people worldwide died from behavior related to, or caused by, schizophrenia.|$|E

25|$|I {{really do}} not think that we should have homosexuals guiding our children. I think that it’s a {{lifestyle}} that I don’t agree with. I realize a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>do.</b> It’s my personal faith, religious faith, that I don’t believe that the people who do this should be raising our children. It’s not a natural thing. You need a mother and a father. You need a man and a woman. That’s what God intended.|$|E
25|$|Around 70–80% {{of people}} {{experience}} no {{significant changes in}} attachment styles over time. The fact that attachment styles do not change {{for a majority of}} people indicates working models are relatively stable. Yet, around 20–30% <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> experience changes in attachment styles. These changes can occur over periods of weeks or months. The number of people who experience changes in attachment styles, and the short periods over which the changes occur, suggest working models are not rigid personality traits.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> {{not start}} smoking at adulthood because of informed decision-making. As a result, much cigarette advertising {{was intended to}} target youth and depicted youths smoking and using tobacco {{as a form of}} leisure and enjoyment. Major cigarette companies would advertise their brands in popular TV shows such as The Flintstones and The Beverly Hillbillies, which were watched by many children and teens. In 1964, after facing much pressure from the public, The Cigarette Advertising Code was created by the Tobacco companies, which prohibited advertising directed to youth.|$|E

25|$|People may compete over {{getting the}} {{benefits}} of a high reputation which may cause competitive altruism. On the other hand, in some experiments a proportion <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous. This may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic. The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.|$|E

[...] Writing that society has become so automated that going through a check-out line at a grocery store without having made eye contact or spoken with the checker is possible, Swiderski favored [...] "insincerely meant human kindness to a robot". She encouraged people to respond to [...] "have a nice day" [...] with [...] "you have a nice day, too" [...] because she hoped that when a sufficient number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> this, {{there could be a}} time when people will sincerely intend it.|$|E

On playing Harry as {{a figment of}} Dexter's imagination, James Remar told Vanity Fair that [...] "it's {{challenging}} to play a specter in somebody’s current existence." [...] He said: [...] "In my own life, I find myself doing some task [...] and {{having a conversation with}} my mother or father, who are both deceased. [...] I suspect lots <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> it. And when I hold that conversation, different images of my parents appear to me.

[...] When asked about playing the only character to join Dexter in his [...] "kill room," [...] Jimmy Smits said: [...] "The crew has a great respect for what they are doing in those scenes. They are energized because those moments are the staple of the show, {{but at the same time}} they are very somber. Michael doesn't really like to interface with a lot of people on those days, because it's such a serious subject matter." ...|$|E

[...] further adding: [...] "A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> think it's too soon for another relationship. But I can assure you that it's done very tastefully." [...] He then added an explanation to how Declan feels, adding: [...] "He feels as though he's cheated on Bridget and that he hasn't mourned for long enough to be able to move on without showing proper respect to the love of his life. He's left confused and upset." [...] As scenes from the storyline began to air Brewer made comment on the storyline reassuring viewers adding: [...] "I think they'll be okay with it...

500|$|... "Business School" [...] was {{the second}} Office episode written by Brent Forrester. [...] Forrester had {{previously}} written [...] "The Merger". [...] The episode {{was the first to}} be directed by Joss Whedon. [...] Whedon, who is a friend of both producer Greg Daniels and Jenna Fischer, and also met most of the production staff prior to the episode, stated that he chose to direct the episode [...] "because I already know the writing staff and a bunch of the cast, and I adore the show."
