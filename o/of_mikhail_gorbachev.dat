5|$|In 2011, Jovovich {{attended}} {{and sang}} at the birthday celebration <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev.</b> The actress also {{gave a speech}} in which she thanked Gorbachev, saying that {{when she and her}} family left the Soviet Union in 1980 they were sadly sure that they would never see their relatives again and that thanks to him they have been reunited.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Brezhnev {{years and}} the lengthy interregnum that followed, the {{generation}} which had come of age during the 'first Russian spring' of the 1950s awaited its turn in power. As Brezhnev and his colleagues died or were pensioned off, they were replaced {{by men and women}} for whom the Secret Speech and the first wave of de-Stalinization had been a formative experience, and these 'Children of Twentieth Congress' took up the reins of power under the leadership <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> and his colleagues. The Khrushchev era provided this second generation of reformers with both an inspiration and a cautionary tale.|$|E
50|$|The district's commander, Marshal of Aviation Anatoly Konstantinov, was {{replaced}} {{shortly before the}} Mathias Rust affair in 1988 for insufficient support <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> perestroika policy.|$|R

5|$|The {{first signs}} of a {{rehabilitation}} were seen during Leonid Brezhnev's rule, when information about him was again allowed {{to be included in}} Soviet encyclopaedias. His connection, support and work in the Anti-Party Group was mentioned in encyclopaedias published in 1973 and 1974, but eventually disappeared altogether by the mid-to-late-1970s. Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko further rehabilitated Molotov; in 1984 Molotov was even allowed to seek membership in the Communist Party. A collection of interviews with Molotov from 1985 was published in 1994 by Felix Chuev as Molotov Remembers: Inside Kremlin Politics. In June 1986, Molotov was hospitalized in Kuntsevo hospital in Moscow and he died, during the rule <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> on 8 November 1986. During his long life Molotov suffered seven myocardial infarctions, but lived to 96 years and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Due to his {{chairmanship}} of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions he gained {{a seat in the}} 28th Politburo and Secretary of the Central Committee. Later that year, with the help <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> Yanayev was elected the first, and only, Vice President of the Soviet Union. Having growing doubts about where Gorbachev's reforms were leading, Yanayev started working with, and eventually formally leading, the Gang of Eight, the group which deposed Gorbachev during the August coup of 1991. After three days the coup collapsed due to the popularity of Boris Yeltsin, but during its brief grip of power Yanayev was made Acting President of the Soviet Union. He was then arrested {{for his role in the}} coup, but in 1994 he was pardoned by the State Duma. He spent the rest of his life working in the Russian tourism administration until his death on 24September 2010.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Luzhkov {{proposed}} {{returning to}} Lubyanka Square the fifteen ton iron statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, {{founder of the}} Soviet Cheka. The statue was removed after the failure of an attempted coup against the Soviet government <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> in 1991. Opponents of the proposal collected the signatures of 114,000 Moscow residents against the statue's return.|$|E

25|$|On his 70th {{birthday}} in 1988, Ceaușescu {{was decorated with}} the Karl-Marx-Orden by then Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) chief Erich Honecker; through this he was honoured for his rejection <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> reforms.|$|R

25|$|During Stalin's lifetime, his {{approved}} biographies {{were largely}} hagiographic in content. Stalin ensured that these works gave very {{little attention to}} his early life, particularly {{because he did not}} wish to emphasise his Georgian origins in a state numerically dominated by Russians. A large number of Stalin biographies have been published since his death. Until the 1980s, these relied largely on the same sources of information as each other. Under the administration <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> a number of previously classified files on Lenin's life were made available to historians, with the rest being released {{after the fall of the}} Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|The two new superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, became {{locked in}} a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on nuclear proliferation. At the same time decolonisation, which had already started after World War I, {{gradually}} resulted in the independence {{of most of the}} European colonies in Asia and Africa. In the 1980s the reforms <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> and the Solidarity movement in Poland accelerated the collapse of the Eastern bloc {{and the end of the}} Cold War. Germany was reunited, after the symbolic fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.|$|E
25|$|The {{hunger strike}} {{galvanized}} {{support for the}} students and aroused sympathy across the country. Around a million Beijing residents {{from all walks of}} life demonstrated in solidarity on 17–18 May. These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials. Many grassroots Party and Youth League organizations, as well as government-sponsored labour unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate. In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to Li Peng in support of students. The Chinese Red Cross issued a special notice and sent in a large number of personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the Square. After the departure <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, giving the movement international spotlight. Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint.|$|E
5000|$|August 1991 - Soviet Union, enemies <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> reforms {{evoked the}} state of {{emergency}} because Gorbachev, according to them, was destroying both communism and the state itself. The leader of the coup was Gennady Yanayev.|$|R
50|$|A {{supporter}} <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> reforms, Gelman {{was elected}} to the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1989 and to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union upon <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> recommendation in 1990, before leaving the Communist Party of the Soviet Union less than a year later.|$|R
50|$|After 19 {{years in}} hiding, he reappeared in public at the Council's annual {{congress}} at Rostov-on-Don in July 1989, {{in the wake}} <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> glasnost and perestroika reforms. After speaking, he quickly made his escape before the waiting KGB could arrest him.|$|R
25|$|On 29 May 1990 he {{was elected}} the {{chairman}} of the Russian Supreme Soviet. On 12 June 1991 {{he was elected}} by popular vote to the newly created post of President of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), at that time one of the 15 constituent republics of the Soviet Union. Upon the resignation <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> and the final dissolution of the Soviet Union on 25 December 1991, the RSFSR became the sovereign state of the Russian Federation, and Yeltsin remained in office as president. He was reelected in the 1996 election, in which critics widely claimed pervasive corruption; in the second round he defeated Gennady Zyuganov from the revived Communist Party by a margin of 13.7%. However, Yeltsin never recovered his early popularity after a series of economic and political crises in Russia in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Stalin's death in 1953, the Central Committee had become largely a {{symbolic}} organ that was responsible to the Politburo, {{and not the other}} way around. The death of Stalin revitalised the Central Committee, and it became an important institution during the power struggle to succeed Stalin. Following Khrushchev's ascension to power, the Central Committee still played a leading role; it overturned the Politburo's decision to remove Khrushchev from office in 1957. In 1964, the Central Committee ousted Khrushchev from power, and elected Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary. The Central Committee was an important organ in the beginning of Brezhnev's rule, but lost effective power to the Politburo. From then on, until the ascension <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> the Central Committee played a minor role in the running of the party and state– the Politburo was the highest political organ in the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Genealogy of Grigoriy Zhukovsky, Odessa citizen, {{attributed}} to the poet Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky (1783-1852). The verses and fairy-tale of this poet were included in school program in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and could be earlier and up today. Also biography of Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky the pupils had to know. As per Soviet school program from the 1950s and up to {{second part of the}} 1980s or beginning of the 1990s the father of this poet was the landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky (died in 1817) and as per legend his father was the landlord Afanasiy Ivanovich Bunin (1716—1791) and the mother was the captive Turkish girl Salha, she was named by Christian name Yelizaveta Dementiyevna Tutchaninova. Their illegitimate boy, as per legend, was adopted by the landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky and named Vasiliy Andreyevich Zhukovsky. Turkey joined the NATO in 1952 and in the 1960s or earlier the NATO was able to watch and listen to the Northern part of the Black Sea, including Odessa. It is why Turkish girl Salha was included in the legend. The landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky, the father of poet, had Polish family name Zhukovsky and the landlords with this family name left in the Eastern Prussia before Swedish and then German invasion in the Eastern Prussia. It is why Soviet Intelligence wished to present Zhukovsky family in Odessa as representatives of Prussian Zhukovsky family branch. To avoid any person of Zhukovsky family in Odessa began thinking about the Royal title, the legend of the Bunin family was introduced. And it was done successfully. During the rule <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> this legend was presented as the correct version to stop this Intelligence activity.|$|E
5|$|In March 1987 Bukovsky {{and nine}} other émigré authors (Ernst Neizvestny, Yury Lyubimov, Vasily Aksyonov and Leonid Plyushch among them) caused a furore in the West {{and then in}} the Soviet Union itself when they raised doubts about the {{substance}} and sincerity <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> reforms.|$|R
50|$|During {{the initial}} period (1985-1987) <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> time in power, {{he talked about}} modifying central planning, but did not make any truly {{fundamental}} changes (uskoreniye, acceleration). Gorbachev {{and his team of}} economic advisers then introduced more fundamental reforms, which became known as perestroika (economic restructuring).|$|R
25|$|The 1980s wave <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> glasnost ("publicity") policy refuted an old Soviet {{version of}} the 1921-24 events. The first Soviet historian, who attempted, in 1988, to revise the {{hitherto}} commonly accepted interpretation of the Soviet-Georgian war, was a notable Georgian scholar, Akaki Surguladze, ironically the same historian whose 1982 monograph described the alleged Georgian worker revolt as a truly historical event.|$|R
500|$|The glasnost (openness) policy, {{introduced}} {{during the}} rule <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev,</b> {{played a major}} role in developing religious freedom in the Soviet Union. Consequently, in 1989, a group of Moscow Catholics and the cultural association [...] "The Polish House" [...] (Russian: Дом Польский), suggested that the building should again be used for religious purposes. Following the city's assent, the first Mass at the site in 60years was celebrated on the church stairs during the feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8December 1990. The Mass was celebrated by the Polish priest Tadeusz Pikus, who later became an auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of Warsaw.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the 1980s, Nixon {{maintained}} an ambitious schedule of speaking engagements and writing, traveled, {{and met with}} many foreign leaders, especially those of Third World countries. He joined former Presidents Ford and Carter as representatives of the United States at the funeral of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. On {{a trip to the}} Middle East, Nixon made his views known regarding Saudi Arabia and Libya, which attracted significant U.S. media attention; The Washington Post ran stories on Nixon's [...] "rehabilitation". Nixon visited the Soviet Union in 1986 and on his return sent President Reagan a lengthy memorandum containing foreign policy suggestions and his personal impressions <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev.</b> Following this trip, Nixon was ranked in a Gallup poll as one of the ten most admired men in the world.|$|E
500|$|Even before Stalin {{had been}} laid to rest, Beria {{launched}} a lengthy series of reforms which rivalled those of Khrushchev during his period of power and even those <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> {{a third of a}} century later. Beria's proposals were designed to denigrate Stalin and pass the blame for Beria's own crimes to the late leader. One proposal, which was adopted, was an amnesty which eventually led to the freeing of over a million prisoners. Another, which was not, was to release East Germany into a united, neutral Germany in exchange for compensation from the West—a proposal considered by Khrushchev to be anti-communist. Khrushchev allied with Malenkov to block many of Beria's proposals, while the two slowly picked up support from other Presidium members. Their campaign against Beria was aided by fears that Beria was planning a military coup, and, according to Khrushchev in his memoirs, by the conviction that [...] "Beria is getting his knives ready for us." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s {{he was one}} <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> chief {{economic}} advisers and among the first Soviet economists to voice {{the need for a}} restructuring of the economic and business infrastructure of the Soviet Union. His ideas were presented in a number of ideological books on perestroika. He also supported the movement for the reunion of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia.|$|R

500|$|This {{vicious cycle}} of {{repression}} and {{reform and the}} economic-political struggle acquired new characteristics with the 1978 election of Karol Wojtyła as Pope John Paul II. Wojtyła's unexpected elevation strengthened {{the opposition to the}} authoritarian and ineffective system of nomenklatura-run state socialism, especially with the pope's first visit to Poland in 1979. In early August 1980, a new wave of strikes resulted in the founding of the independent trade union [...] "Solidarity" [...] (Polish Solidarność) led by electrician Lech Wałęsa. The growing strength and activity of the opposition caused the government of Wojciech Jaruzelski to declare martial law in December 1981. However, with the reforms <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> in the Soviet Union, increasing pressure from the West, and dysfunctional economy, the regime was forced to negotiate with its opponents. The 1989 Round Table Talks led to Solidarity's participation in the 1989 election; its candidates' striking victory gave rise to the first of the succession of transitions from communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe. In 1990, Jaruzelski resigned from the presidency of the Republic of Poland and, after the December 1990 elections, was succeeded by Wałęsa.|$|E
500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the October Revolution, and during the Russian Civil War, the Soviet government forcibly confiscated property to support their government. After the inflation of the 1920s printing of money nearly ceased and confiscation of goods became harder; after years of confiscating there was simply not enough property left to fund government operations anymore. After the civil war the confiscation of property ceased and several government taxes were introduced. The ministry's tasks were summed up in the 1971 charter: [...] "The USSR Ministry of Finance prepares the draft of the USSR State Budget and bears responsibility for the fulfilment of the USSR State Budget, both for receipts and for expenditures [...] ". Under the rule <b>of</b> <b>Mikhail</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> the Ministry lost much of its power. An example being that before 1990 all foreign trade investments had to be approved by the Ministry of Finance but in 1990 the ministries of finance of the Union republics approved foreign investment. The ministry was of vital importance and in the 1971 charter the Soviet government gave the ministry broad legislative power. As nearly all organisations had some sort of financial aspects the Ministry of Finance set standards and rules for accounting and bookkeeping. It also had the power to issue regulations for the detailed application of the tax legislation. This is also a common feature in the United States Department of Treasury, although the Soviet's regulations differ in being of a highly centralised manner that the US one does not. The Ministry of Finance usually exercised its powers jointly with other government agencies. The 1971 charter states that the Ministry of Finance had the right to participate with the State Committee on Prices for price-setting in the USSR, but it also participated in the setting of salaries and the fulfillment of the five-year plans with the State Planning Committee and the State Bank of the USSR (Gosbank).|$|E
