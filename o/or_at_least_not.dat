5|$|Three years later, Kioe Lie visits {{his brother}} in the latter's Batavia home. Kioe Gie has become {{an editor of the}} {{newspaper}} Kamadjoean and is known as a generous philanthropist. Kioe Lie, meanwhile, has become the manager of a tapioca factory, but is planning to leave for competing business run by Tjio Tam Bing, who has offered him twice the salary. Kioe Gie asks him to reconsider, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> take any customers, but Kioe Lie is set on his goals. Before Kioe Lie leaves, the brothers discuss marriage: since Kioe Lie has no intent to marry Hap Nio soon, Kioe Gie asks permission to marry first. Though Kioe Lie disapproves of Kioe Gie's sweetheart, a poor orphan girl named Oeij Ijan Nio, he agrees.|$|E

5|$|In June 1108 Ralph succeeded Gundulf as Bishop of Rochester, {{having been}} {{nominated}} by Gundulf before his death. Ralph was consecrated on 9 August 1108. He was at Anselm's deathbed in April 1109, and, afterwards, Ralph acted as {{administrator of the}} see of Canterbury until 26 April 1114, when he was chosen Archbishop at Windsor. The king had wanted his doctor, Faricus, who was an Italian and Abbot of Abingdon, but the nobles and the bishops objected to anyone but a Norman being appointed. The bishops also desired someone {{who was not a}} monk, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> one who was so close to Henry. As a compromise, Ralph was chosen, rather than the secular clergy that the bishops favoured. Although Ralph was a monk and had not served as a royal clerk, he was also a bishop, which seems to have reconciled the other bishops to his selection.|$|E
5|$|In 1147 William fitzHerbert, the Archbishop of York, was deposed, {{and a new}} {{election}} for the archbishopric was ordered by Pope Eugenius III on 11 May 1147. The election took place on 24 July 1147 at Richmond rather than York, due to the opposition of William of Aumale, the Earl of York, who supported the ousted archbishop. Robert, along with Hugh de Puiset {{and some of the}} cathedral chapter, favoured Hilary, a canon lawyer. Most {{of the rest of the}} archdiocese's officials and the chapter favoured Henry Murdac. The disputed election was decided by the pope, who declared Murdac the new archbishop and gave the vacant bishopric of Chichester to Hilary. Murdac was consecrated by Eugenius on 7 December 1147, and Robert appears to have supported the new archbishop, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> to have actively opposed him. But others among the cathedral chapter and suffragan bishops of York continued to actively agitate against Murdac, including refusing him entry to York for three years. Robert took little other part in the disputes at York during Murdac's archiepiscopate. Probably, it was Robert's involvement in secular office as chancellor that restricted his activities with his ecclesiastical office. Robert may have become a supporter of Murdac's during this time, as the archbishop addressed at least six confirmation grants to Robert.|$|E

25|$|By one standard, no work created {{before the}} fantasy genre was defined can be {{considered}} to belong to it, {{no matter how many}} fantastic elements it includes.

But even by the more limited definition a full examination {{of the history of the}} fantastic in literature is necessary to show the origins of the modern genre.

25|$|Ancient Greek and Roman {{religion}} {{distinguished between}} animals that were sacred to a deity {{and those that}} were prescribed as the correct sacrificial offerings for the god.

Since sacrificial meat was eaten at a banquet after the gods received their portion – mainly the entrails (exta) — {{it follows that the}} animals sacrificed were most often, though not always, domestic animals normally part of the Roman diet. Gods often received castrated male animals as sacrifices, and the goddesses female victims; Mars, however, regularly received intact males. Mars did receive oxen under a few of his cult titles, such as Mars Grabovius, but the usual offering was the bull, singly, in multiples, or in combination with other animals.|$|E
25|$|If {{it should}} be {{declared}} that contraception is not evil in itself, then we should have to concede frankly that the Holy Spirit {{had been on the}} side of the Protestant churches in 1930 (when the encyclical Casti Connubii was promulgated), in 1951 (Pius XII's address to the midwives), and in 1958 (the address delivered before the Society of Hematologists in the year the pope died). It should likewise have to be admitted that for a half century the Spirit failed to protect Pius XI, Pius XII, and a large part of the Catholic hierarchy from a very serious error. This would mean that the leaders of the Church, acting with extreme imprudence, had condemned thousands of innocent human acts, forbidding, under pain of eternal damnation, a practice which would now be sanctioned. The fact can neither be denied nor ignored that these same acts would now be declared licit on the grounds of principles cited by the Protestants, which popes and bishops have either condemned <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> approved.|$|E

500|$|Almost {{immediately}} after {{the establishment of the}} new system, conflict arose. The American Revolutionary War drove potential settlers away from Prince Edward Island. This caused two problems - firstly, it made it difficult for proprietors to fulfill an obligation attached to their grants, to settle one person per [...] within ten years of the system's commencement, and secondly, it meant that the proprietors were not being paid much rent, as there were not many tenants to pay it. This meant that the proprietors were unable, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> willing, to pay the required quitrent to the Crown. Conflict also arose between the tenants and the proprietors. As the lottery for Prince Edward Island land was held in London, and most of the proprietors were important figures from the United Kingdom, most of the proprietors did not actually live in British North America. This meant that many neglected their obligations to the settlers.|$|E
500|$|Finding the Persian fleet {{gone from}} Samos, the Allies were thrown into uncertainty. Eventually they {{resolved}} {{that they would}} sail to the mainland, and equipped themselves for a naval battle. However, when the Allies approached Mycale, the Persians {{did not attempt to}} engage them, and remained guarding their camp. Leotychides therefore sailed as close to the camp as possible, and had a herald make an appeal to the Ionians: [...] "Men of Ionia, you who hear us, understand what I say, for by no means will the Persians understand anything I charge you with when we join battle; first of all it is right for each man to remember his freedom and next the battle-cry Hebe: and let him who hears me tell him who has not heard it." [...] Herodotus suggests that the purpose of this message was twofold; firstly to encourage the Ionians, unbeknownst to the Persians, to fight for the Allies (<b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> to fight against them); or, if the message became known to the Persians, to make the Persians mistrust the Ionians.|$|E
500|$|After {{the premiere}} the writer Léon Vallas opined that Stravinsky had written music 30 {{years ahead of}} its time, {{suitable}} {{to be heard in}} 1940. Coincidentally, it was in that year that Walt Disney released Fantasia, an animated feature film using music from The Rite and other classical compositions, conducted by Stokowski. The Rite segment of the film depicted the Earth's prehistory, with the creation of life, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs as the finale. Among those impressed by the film was Gunther Schuller, later a composer, conductor and jazz scholar. The Rite of Spring sequence, he says, overwhelmed him and determined his future career in music: [...] "I hope [...] appreciated that hundreds—perhaps thousands—of musicians were turned onto The Rite of Spring... through Fantasia, musicians who might otherwise never have heard the work, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> until many years later". In later life Stravinsky claimed distaste for the adaptation, though as Ross remarks, he said nothing critical at the time; according to Ross, the composer Paul Hindemith observed that [...] "Igor appears to love it".|$|E

500|$|Marshall Fine of The Huffington Post {{noted that}} like the novel, {{the film is}} {{difficult}} to embrace.

He stated that he [...] "no doubt was aiming for an eerie, Children of the Damned vibe, except that it's the children who are damned". The writer concluded that Never Let Me Gos final result is a [...] "staid, lifeless tale that never talks about what it's about, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> enough to provoke deep thoughts on the subject." [...] Film critic Rex Roberts of Film Journal International thought that the film was moderately surprising given Romanek and Garland's previous work, saying that they [...] "show real affinity for the subtle shades of resignation and quiet desperation that characterize Isighuro's [...] prose and, as would be expected, accentuate the unsettling eeriness that pervades Never Let Me Go". Roberts felt that Mulligan and Knightley were not convincing in portraying their ages until the last third of the movie.|$|E

[...] D'Onofrio cited Feige's {{previous}} reasoning {{as well as the}} fact that the films already had difficulty [...] "bringing big characters in that they have to service in the writing" [...] and adding characters from the television series would be [...] "just too many characters" [...] since the films were [...] "trying to figure out already how to individualize more {{and at the same time}} keep The Avengers going."

500|$|Coordination {{failure is}} another {{potential}} explanation for recessions and unemployment. In recessions a factory can go idle {{even though there}} are people willing to work in it, and people willing to buy its production if they had jobs. In such a scenario, economic downturns appear {{to be the result of}} coordination failure: The invisible hand fails to coordinate the usual, optimal, flow of production and consumption. Russell Cooper and Andrew John (1988) expressed a general form of coordination as models with multiple equilibria where agents could coordinate to improve (<b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> harm) each of their respective situations. Cooper and John based their work on earlier models including Peter Diamond's (1982) coconut model, which demonstrated a case of coordination failure involving search and matching theory. In Diamond's model producers are more likely to produce if they see others producing. The increase in possible trading partners increases the likelihood of a given producer finding someone to trade with. As in other cases of coordination failure, Diamond's model has multiple equilibria, and the welfare of one agent is dependent on the decisions of others. Diamond's model is an example of a [...] "thick-market externality" [...] that causes markets to function better when more people and firms participate in them. Other potential sources of coordination failure include self-fulfilling prophecies. If a firm anticipates a fall in demand, they might cut back on hiring. A lack of job vacancies might worry workers who then cut back on their consumption. This fall in demand meets the firm's expectations, but it is entirely due to the firm's own actions.|$|E
