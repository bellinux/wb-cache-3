Traditional demand based models incorporating risk and shortage costs are developed. The two major components of an <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> model, <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> and procurement lead-time are reviewed and discussed. Data for both <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> and procurement lead-time for the LM- 2500 Gas Turbine Engine, and <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> for the U. S.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{management}} of working time flexibility and firm performance, measured by <b>operating</b> <b>hours,</b> in {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) in Europe. Design/methodology/approach – The paper analyses the European Capital Operating time, Work and Employment Survey (EUCOWE), designed to collect workplace information on <b>operating</b> <b>hours.</b> With data on more than 17, 000 establishments in six European countries – France, Germany, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the UK – the paper analyses working time patterns and <b>operating</b> <b>hours.</b> Findings – The authors show the positive relationship between company size and operating times and how SMEs make more limited use of more advanced forms of working-time organisation that may allow them to extend their <b>operating</b> <b>hours.</b> The use of less complex working time measures such as overtime does not have the same positive association with <b>operating</b> <b>hours.</b> However, the results also highlight that smaller establishments can still benefit from the adoption of certain working time practices. The results suggest that the influence of the regulatory environment on the use of working practices or the duration of <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> is not straightforward, and as such the impact of national regulatory frameworks cannot be discounted in the country-specific differences identified. Originality/value – The paper uses the first comparable data on <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> and working patterns to demonstrate the limitations on SME operating times across European countries.

40|$|Load {{factors are}} an {{important}} simplification of electrical energy use data and depend on the ratio of average demand to peak demand. Based on <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> of a facility they serve as an important benchmarking tool for the industrial sector. The <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> of small and medium sized manufacturing facilities are analyzed to identify the most common <b>operating</b> <b>hour</b> or shift work patterns. About 75 % of manufacturing facilities fall into expected <b>operating</b> <b>hour</b> patterns with <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> near 40, 80, 120 and 168 hours/week. Two types of load factors, electrical and production are computed for each shift classification within major industry categories in the U. S. The load factor based on monthly billing hours (ELF) increases with <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> from about 0. 4 for a nominal one shift operation, to about 0. 7 for around-the-clock operation. On the other hand, the load factor based on production hours (PLF) shows an inverse trend, varying from about 1. 4 for one shift operation to 0. 7 for around-the-clock operation. When used as a diagnostic tool, if the PLF exceeds unity, then unnecessary energy consumption may be taking place. For plants <b>operating</b> at 40 <b>hours</b> per week, the ELF value was found to greater than the theoretical maximum, while the PLF value was greater than one, suggesting that these facilities may have significant energy usage outside production hours. The data for the PLF however, is more scattered for plants operating less than 80 hours per week, indicating that grouping PLF data based on <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> {{may not be a}} reasonable approach to benchmarking energy use in industries. This analysis uses annual electricity consumption and demand along with <b>operating</b> <b>hour</b> data of manufacturing plants available in the U. S. Department of Energy?s Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) database. The annual values are used because more desirable monthly data are not available. Monthly data are preferred as they capture the load profile of the facility more accurately. The data there come from Industrial Assessment Centers which employ university engineering students, faculty and staff to perform energy assessments for small to medium-sized manufacturing plants. The nation-wide IAC program is sponsored by the U. S. Department of Energy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{high voltage}} power {{metering}} system is mainly {{composed of a}} current transformer (CT), voltage transformer (PT), consisting of two wire electric energy meter and connecting them. In the high-voltage power metering system, current transformer is important electrical equipment. Structure of current transformer is relatively simple, and it is consisting of mutually insulated winding, a two winding, iron core and frame, shell, terminal etc [...] Three-phase watt <b>hour</b> <b>meter</b> is {{used to measure the}} three-phase AC induction type meter active electric energy. The paper presents using current transformer and three-phase watt <b>hour</b> <b>meter</b> to design of high voltage power metering system. Simulation results show that this model can detect fault of current transformer.
