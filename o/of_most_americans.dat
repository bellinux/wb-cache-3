25|$|McCarthy's {{decision}} to run arose partly as {{an outcome of}} {{opposition to the war}} by Wayne Morse of Oregon, one of the two Senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution of August 1964. Morse gave speeches denouncing the war before it had entered the consciousness <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans.</b> Following that, several politically active Oregon Democrats asked Robert Kennedy to run as an anti-war candidate. Initially Kennedy refused, so the group asked McCarthy to run, and he responded favorably.|$|E
25|$|The steady {{expansion}} and {{rapid population growth}} of the United States after 1815 contrasted sharply with static European societies, as visitors described the rough, sometimes violent, {{but on the whole}} hugely optimistic and forward-looking attitude <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans.</b> While land ownership was something most Europeans could only dream of, contemporary accounts show that the average American farmer owned his land and fed his family far more than European peasants, and could make provisions for land for his children. Europeans commonly talked of the egalitarianism of American society, which had no landed nobility and which theoretically allowed anyone regardless of birth to become successful. For example, in Germany, the universities, the bureaucracy and the army officers required high family status; in Britain rich families purchased commissions in the army for their sons {{for tens of thousands of}} pounds. Rich merchants and factory owners did emerge in Europe, but they seldom had social prestige or political power. By contrast the U.S. had more millionaires than any country in Europe by 1850. Most rich Americans had well-to-do fathers, but their grandfathers were of average wealth. Poor boys of the 1850s like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller were two of the richest men in the world by 1900. Historians have emphasized that upward social mobility came in small steps over time, and over generations, with the Carnegie-like rags-to-riches scenario a rare one. Some ethnic groups (like Yankees, Irish and Jews) prized upward mobility, and emphasized education as the fastest route; other groups (such as Germans, Poles and Italians) emphasized family stability and home ownership more. Stagnant cities offered less mobility opportunities, leading the more ambitious young men to head to growth centers, often out west.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{controversy}} of his game, Ledonne became an unwitting spokesman for the games industry, facing the medium's opponents in debates and forums. The furor resulting from Slamgate was called out by Ledonne and others in the media as a sign that video games had not yet outgrown the traditional stereotype of children's games.

[...] For reasons of bookkeeping, an entire bar was set as the minimum purchase, which placed the gold outside of the reach <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans.</b> North Carolina senator Jesse Helms was critical of the plan, saying that he was [...] "opposed to the sale of U.S. gold to foreign and international banks and gold dealers" [...] and that medallions should be [...] "produced in small size, suitable for sale to average citizens." [...] On the day of the Treasury announcement, Helms introduced the Gold Medallion Act of 1978. The stated intent was to provide average consumers with affordable, small-sized gold bullion to compete with the South African Krugerrand and other world bullion coins, which were becoming increasingly popular with American investors. 1.6 million troy ounces (50,000kg) ounces of gold had been imported into the United States in the form of Krugerrands in 1977 alone.

2500|$|A central {{motivating}} {{force behind}} the overthrow of monarchy and aristocracy was the American embrace of a political ideology called [...] "republicanism", which was dominant in the colonies by 1775 but of minor importance back in Great Britain.

Americans feared that the corruption was crossing the Atlantic; the commitment <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> to republican values and to their rights energized the revolution, as Britain was increasingly seen as hopelessly corrupt and hostile to American interests. Britain seemed to threaten the established liberties that Americans enjoyed. The greatest threat to liberty was depicted as corruption—not just in London but at home, as well. The colonists associated it with luxury, and especially with inherited aristocracy, which they condemned.|$|E

When the [...] "Bonus Army" [...] was granted the right to march down Pennsylvania Avenue, it transformed the protestors in the eyes <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> from rabble-rousers to patriots seeking fairness. On July 28, 1932, President Herbert Hoover ordered General Douglas MacArthur to remove the Bonus Army from the site. At 4:45p.m., MacArthur led a battalion of infantry, a squadron of cavalry, and six battle tanks (commanded by Major George S. Patton) down Pennsylvania Avenue to remove the Bonus Army. More than 20,000 civil service workers (leaving their offices for the day) watched as the U.S. Army attacked its own veterans.

2500|$|In 1937, Patrick McDonald and his {{two sons}} Richard and Maurice inaugurated the simple {{restaurant}} [...] "Airdrome" [...] on Huntington Drive (Route 66) near the airport in the American city of Monrovia, California. The success of its sales {{eventually led to the}} May 15, 1940, opening of a restaurant named McDonald's along U.S. Route 66 in San Bernardino, California. After analyzing their sales, the brothers discovered that, to their surprise, 80% of their revenue was coming from selling hamburgers. The menu initially featured 25 different dishes, the majority of which were barbecued. Through their new restaurant, the McDonald brothers introduced the notion of fast food to parts of the Western United States by 1948. From the beginning, McDonald's focused on making hot dogs and hamburgers as efficiently and quickly as possible. During the 1940s, simple and formative concepts took root at McDonald's, including the preparation and service of burgers in just one minute and the ability for customers to eat in their own cars in a drive-in style. All the while, the restaurant was trying to further develop a hamburger that was inexpensive enough to be within the economic reach <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans.</b> By the 1950s, the concept of drive-in style service had become firmly established and hamburgers and cars had become closely connected {{in the minds of many}} Americans. It was now not only possible for a customer to purchase a hamburger without getting out of a car, and a customer also no longer needed to wait to be served. The McDonald brothers built upon the achievements of their original San Bernardino restaurant when in 1953 they began franchising their now famous chain restaurants, starting in Phoenix, Arizona and Downey, California (the latter of which is still in operation). Later, Ray Kroc opened one in the northwest Chicago suburb of Des Plaines, Illinois on April 15, 1955, which has now been converted into the McDonald's Museum. It is noteworthy that the original McDonald's mascot was a hamburger faced cook called [...] "Speedee" [...] that would serve as the iconographic identity of the company until being replaced by the clown Ronald McDonald in 1963.|$|E
