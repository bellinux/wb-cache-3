5|$|On 12 December 1997, the World Motorsport Council {{ruled that}} the mayor of Jerez, Pedro Pacheco, {{disrupted}} the podium ceremony. Originally, the verdict was that no further Formula One races would <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> track. However, when Mr Pacheco appeared before the WMSC, this ruling was rescinded.|$|E

5|$|Others {{argue that}} there is no {{available}} evidence that demonstrates that any of these organisms are capable of causing aphthous stomatitis by themselves. Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time as asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titres. However, antiviral medication has no effect on aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
5|$|Sinhala {{alphabet}} {{differs from}} other Indo-Aryan alphabets {{in that it}} contains a pair of vowel sounds (U+0DD0 and U+0DD1 in the proposed Unicode Standard) that are unique to it.

5|$|The next {{significant}} part {{he would play}} in the war would <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Abydos. Alcibiades had remained behind at Samos with a small force while Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus led {{the greater part of}} the fleet to the Hellespont. During this period, Alcibiades succeeded in raising money from Caria and the neighboring area, with which he was able to pay the rowers and gain their favor. After the Athenian victory at Cynossema, both fleets summoned all their ships from around the Aegean to join them for what might be a decisive next engagement.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} walrus, bowhead whale, and caribou hunting are all real. Because the hunting season for caribou, polar bear, walrus, and whale <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time, the {{production}} {{was forced to}} spend more than a year in the Arctic (covering two hunting seasons) {{in order to get the}} necessary footage.|$|E
5|$|The spores of G.pectinatum are {{brown and}} opaque. They have a roughly spherical shape and are ornamented with {{transparent}} (hyaline), truncate warts; the diameter is 4–4.5µm, or 5.5–6.5 if the lengths of the warts is included. Spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are 2- or 4-spored, while cystidia (specialized sterile cells that <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hymenial surface in some mushrooms) are absent. The capillitia—a mass of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores—are light brown and 3–7µm in diameter. They are tapered, thick-walled {{with a narrow}} interior, and either smooth or slightly encrusted.|$|E

5|$|The {{unusually high}} {{concentration}} of oxygen gas on Earth {{is the result of}} the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration, decay, and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same rate.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{categories}} of thorium minerals for thorium extraction: primary and secondary. Primary deposits occur in acidic granitic magmas and pegmatites. They are concentrated, but of small size. Secondary deposits <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mouths of rivers in granitic mountain regions. In these deposits, thorium is enriched along with other heavy minerals. Initial concentration varies {{with the type of}} deposit.|$|E
5|$|After DNA damage, {{cell cycle}} checkpoints are activated. Checkpoint {{activation}} pauses the cell cycle {{and gives the}} cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide. DNA damage checkpoints <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> G1/S and G2/M boundaries. An intra-S checkpoint also exists. Checkpoint activation is controlled by two master kinases, ATM and ATR. ATM responds to DNA double-strand breaks and disruptions in chromatin structure, whereas ATR primarily responds to stalled replication forks. These kinases phosphorylate downstream targets in a signal transduction cascade, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest. A class of checkpoint mediator proteins including BRCA1, MDC1, and 53BP1 has also been identified. These proteins seem to be required for transmitting the checkpoint activation signal to downstream proteins.|$|E

This <b>occurs</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> speed {{for which the}} difference between thrust and drag is the greatest (maximum excess thrust). In a jet airplane, this is approximately minimum drag speed, <b>occurring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the drag vs. speed curve.|$|R

5|$|Aquatic midges (Chironomidae) {{provide the}} highest {{proportion}} of the fly life of the lake. The trout (Salmonidae) will feed at the surface on these and water boatmen (Corixidae), and below the surface on the caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae and pupae; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge. Other aquatic fauna including daphnia and snails are {{also found in the}} lake. Large populations of dragonflies, including migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) and significant numbers of ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum), <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lake. Eleven species of wainscot moth make their home in the reed beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot (Archanara dissoluta), twin-spotted wainscot (Archanara geminipuncta) and silky wainscot (Chilodes maritimus).|$|E
5|$|Following their {{respective}} breeding seasons, {{several species of}} hummingbirds <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same locations in North America, and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have converged to a common morphology and color because these are effective at attracting the birds. Different lengths and curvatures of the corolla tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology. Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill {{in a particular way}} when probing the flower, especially when the bill and corolla are both curved. This allows the plant to place pollen on a certain part of the bird's body, permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Growth in the Northeast was {{accompanied}} by the creation of moral reform organizations, such as Sunday schools, temperance associations, tract and Bible societies, and orphanages. The proliferation of voluntary organizations was encouraged by postmillennialism, {{the belief that the}} Second Coming of Christ would <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of an era of peace and prosperity fostered by human effort. The 1815 General Assembly recommended the creation of societies to promote morality. Organizations such as the American Bible Society, the American Sunday School Union, and the American Colonization Society, while theoretically interdenominational, were dominated by Presbyterians and considered unofficial agencies of the Presbyterian Church.|$|E
