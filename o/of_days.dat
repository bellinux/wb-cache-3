The aim of the present paper is to identify the times <b>of</b> <b>day</b> during which railway vibration causes the greatest annoyance, to measure the differences between annoyance responses for different time periods and to obtain estimates of the time <b>of</b> <b>day</b> penalties. This was achieved using data from case studies comprised of face-to-face interviews and internal vibration measurements (N= 755). Results indicate that vibration annoyance differs with time <b>of</b> <b>day</b> and that separate time <b>of</b> <b>day</b> weights can be applied when considering exposure–response relationships from railway vibration in residential environments...|$|R
