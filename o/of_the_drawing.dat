5|$|Designed by Burges for himself, the Zodiac settle was {{originally}} placed in his rooms at 15 Buckingham Street on The Strand in London, and later moved to The Tower House in Holland Park around 1878, when Burges first occupied the house. The Tower House {{was designed by}} Burges by himself. Burges continued to work on Tower House {{until his death in}} 1881, and the Zodiac settle was placed opposite the drawing room windows in Tower House. The decoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> room remained unfinished upon Burges's death. The Tower House was subsequently owned by Burges's brother-in-law, Pullan, and then by Colonel T.H. Minshall in the 1920s. Minshall offered the Zodiac settle and other items from Tower House for sale in 1933, but the settle remained unsold.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to other rooms within the castle, Lord Bute's Bedroom, sited above the Winch Room, {{is relatively small}} and simple. The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but the expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Drawing</b> Room to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and dressing table are pared-down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} age of the figure are unclear. It is often thought of as an ancient construction, though the {{earliest}} mention of it dates to the late 17th century. Early antiquarians associated it, on little evidence, with a Saxon deity, while other scholars sought to identify it with a Celtic British figure of the Greek Hercules or some syncretization of the two. Archaeological evidence that parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> have been lost over time strengthen the Hercules identification. The lack of earlier descriptions leads some modern scholars to conclude that it probably dates from the 17th century, and perhaps originated as political satire.|$|E

5|$|Tucker's law {{practice}} could {{not support the}} expenses essential to his extravagant social exploits, which included gambling at cards and races, and he proceeded to waste the capital from Mary Tucker's estate. He was drawn to speculative investments and ultimately was embroiled in a financial scandal. In 1803, he joined other prominent citizens in organizing a lottery {{to raise funds for}} the Richmond Academy. He allegedly bought several chances for himself and, as remaining chances dwindled, resold some of them for a profit; he also was said to have positioned himself as one of four or five holders sure to be a winner. He held the winning stub when his ticket was purportedly found lodged in a joint <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> drum.|$|E
5|$|After much persuasion, he overcame {{his fear}} and {{eventually}} made three trips to Singapore to restore his murals in December 1963, July 1982 and May 1988. The 1982 restoration was more intensive and the invaluable assistance given to Warren by {{the officers and}} boys of the SAF Boys' School enabled {{the bulk of the}} work to be completed. Of the original five murals, only one was not fully restored; the mural of St Luke in Prison. Stanley's original tracing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> was missing, and he could not remember the details of the missing portion. In 1985, Stanley's original drawing was discovered in the memorabilia of Wally Hammond who had been a fellow prisoner with Stanley. These original sketches were subsequently donated to the National Archives of Singapore. From the original, Stanley painted a small picture, which was placed below the remaining piece of the mural in 1988. He was, by then, not fit enough to restore the actual mural.|$|E

25|$|The area of {{a drawing}} {{is the size of}} its {{smallest}} bounding box, relative to the closest distance between any two vertices. Drawings with smaller area are generally preferable to those with larger area, because they allow the features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> to be shown at greater size and therefore more legibly.

25|$|It is PSPACE-hard to {{determine}} whether a specified player has a winning strategy. And if a polynomial bound is placed on the number of moves that are allowed in between jumps (which is a reasonable generalization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> rule in standard Checkers), then the problem is in PSPACE, thus it is PSPACE-complete. However, without this bound, Checkers is EXPTIME-complete.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> also shows {{an image of}} the Buddha {{pointing}} toward the moon; this represents the path to liberation. While in Theravada Buddhism this is the Noble Eightfold Path, in Mahayana Buddhism this is the Bodhisattva path, striving to liberation for all sentient beings. In Tibetan Buddhism, this is Lamrim, which details all the stages on the path, while Zen has its own complicated history of the entanglement of meditation practice and direct insight.|$|E
25|$|Cold Drawing, ProcessDrawing: In this process, the {{material}} being drawn is {{at room temperature}} (i.e. Cold-Drawn). The pointed/reduced {{end of the bar}} or coil, which is smaller than the die opening, is passed through the die where it enters a gripping device <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> machine. The drawing machine pulls or draws the remaining unreduced section of the bar or coil through the die. The die reduces the cross section of the original bar or coil, shapes the profile of the product and increases the length of the original product.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{possible}} {{to carry out the}} process of subdividing a triangle to form an Apollonian network in such a way that, at every step, the edge lengths are rational numbers; it is an open problem whether every planar graph has a drawing with this property. It is possible in polynomial time to find a drawing of a planar 3-tree with integer coordinates minimizing the area of the bounding box <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing,</b> and to test whether a given planar 3-tree may be drawn with its vertices on a given set of points.|$|E
25|$|Several graph drawing {{researchers}} have investigated algorithms for drawing graphs {{in such a}} way that the automorphisms of the graph become visible as symmetries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing.</b> This may be done either by using a method that is not designed around symmetries, but that automatically generates symmetric drawings when possible, or by explicitly identifying symmetries and using them to guide vertex placement in the drawing. It is not always possible to display all symmetries of the graph simultaneously, so it may be necessary to choose which symmetries to display and which to leave unvisualized.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Eakins {{produced}} {{a number of}} large paintings which brought the portrait out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> room and into the offices, streets, parks, rivers, arenas, and surgical amphitheaters of his city. These active outdoor venues allowed him to paint the subject which most inspired him: the nude or lightly clad figure in motion. In the process he could model the forms {{of the body in}} full sunlight, and create images of deep space utilizing his studies in perspective. Eakins also took a keen interest in the new technologies of motion photography, a field in which he is now seen as an innovator.|$|E

25|$|On 7 December 2007, a {{fragment}} of a red chalk drawing of {{a section of the}} dome of the basilica, almost certainly by the hand of Michelangelo, was discovered in the Vatican archives. The drawing shows a small precisely drafted section of the plan of the entabulature above two of the radial columns of the cupola drum. Michelangelo is known to have destroyed thousands of his drawings before his death. The rare survival of this example is probably due to its fragmentary state and the fact that detailed mathematical calculations had been made over the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Orthogonal layout methods, {{which allow}} {{the edges of}} the graph to run {{horizontally}} or vertically, parallel to the coordinate axes of the layout. These methods were originally designed for VLSI and PCB layout problems but they have also been adapted for graph drawing. They typically involve a multiphase approach in which an input graph is planarized by replacing crossing points by vertices, a topological embedding of the planarized graph is found, edge orientations are chosen to minimize bends, vertices are placed consistently with these orientations, and finally a layout compaction stage reduces the area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some authors {{add more}} {{constraints}} {{to the definition}} of a drawing, for instance that each pair of edges have at most one intersection point (a shared endpoint or crossing). For the crossing number as defined above, these constraints make no difference, because a crossing-minimal drawing cannot have edges with multiple intersection points. If two edges with a shared endpoint cross, the drawing can be changed locally at the crossing point, leaving the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> unchanged, to produce a different drawing with one fewer crossing. And similarly, if two edges cross two or more times, the drawing can be changed locally at two crossing points to make a different drawing with two fewer crossings. However, these constraints are relevant for variant definitions of the crossing number that, for instance, count only the numbers of pairs of edges that cross rather than the number of crossings.|$|E
