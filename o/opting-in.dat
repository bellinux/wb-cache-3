40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{benefits}} and costs of a non-euro country <b>opting-in</b> to the banking union. The decision to opt-in depends on the comparison between {{the assessment of the}} banking union attractiveness and the robustness of a national safety net. The benefits of <b>opting-in</b> are still only potential and uncertain, while costs are more tangible. Due to treaty constraints, non-euro countries participating in the banking union will not be on equal footing with euro area members. Analysis presented in the paper points out that reducing the weaknesses of the banking union and thus providing incentives for <b>opting-in</b> is not probable in the short term, mainly due to political constraints. Until a fully-fledged banking union with well-capitalized backstops is established it may be optimal for a non-euro country to join the banking union upon the euro adoption.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Early {{diagnosis}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) allows for appropriately timed interventions with improved outcomes, but HIV screening among asymptomatic persons and the general population in Singapore remains low. In 2008, Singapore's Ministry of Health implemented HIV voluntary opt-out screening (VOS) for hospitalised adults. We evaluated the outcome of VOS and surveyed reasons for its low uptake in our institution. METHODS: We assessed the outcomes of the VOS programme from January 2010 to December 2013 at National University Hospital, a 1081 -bed tertiary hospital in Singapore. We also examined reasons for <b>opting-in</b> and opting-out using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire in a representative sample in January 2013. RESULTS: 107, 523 patients fulfilled VOS criteria and were offered HIV screening, of which 5215 (4. 9 %) agreed to testing. 4850 (93. 1 %) of those who opted-in had an HIV test done. Three (0. 06 %) tested positive for HIV. 238 patients (14. 2 %) were surveyed regarding reasons for <b>opting-in</b> or out of VOS. 21 (8. 8 %) had opted-in. Patients who opted-in {{were likely to be}} younger, more educated and reported having more regular sexual partners. Type of housing, number of casual sexual partners, sexual orientation, intravenous drug use, condom use and previous sexually transmitted infection were not associated with deciding to opt-in/out. Patients' most common reasons for opting-out were: belief that they were at low risk (50. 2 %), belief that they were too old (26. 8 %), cost (6. 9 %) and aversion to venepuncture (6. 5 %). The most common reason for <b>opting-in</b> was desire to know their HIV status (47. 6 %). CONCLUSION: The success of an HIV-VOS program is largely determined by test uptake. Our study showed that the majority of eligible VOS patients opted-out of HIV screening. Given the considerable cost and low yield of this programme, {{more needs to be done}} to better equip patients in self-risk assessment and opting in to testing...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the topic}} of {{differentiated}} integration in the European Union has become increasingly discussed in both political science research and politics in general. Whereas differentiated integration is viewed as necessary for deeper cooperation, recent findings suggest that it increases the gulf between participants and non-participants, {{making it difficult for}} non-participating countries to join in later negotiations. However, {{there is a lack of}} theoretical and empirical work regarding the relationship between different levels of participation in the EU and national policy outcomes. This article addresses this question by comparing the policy outcomes in fully participating, selectively participating (<b>opting-in)</b> and non-participating (opting-out) EU Member States relative to EU legislation. The findings show that selective participation (<b>opting-in)</b> increases state conformity with EU laws relative to no integration at all (opting-out), but it does not completely bridge the gap between fully integrated Member States and non-participants. The results suggest that countries with flexible arrangements are generally less likely to implement EU laws than full participants, even when they choose to legally commit to the EU requirements. This finding raises some further questions about the rationale behind selective participation and its consequences for policy conformity, if its application expands to other policy areas and more Member States in the future...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a legal and economic {{analysis of the}} European Commission’s recent proposals for reforming the application of VAT to financial services, with particular focus on their “third pillar”, under which firms {{would be allowed to}} opt-into taxation on exempt insurance and financial services. From a legal perspective, we show that the proposals ’ “first and second pillar ” would give rise to considerable interpretative and qualification problems, resulting in as much complexity and legal uncertainty as the current regime. Equally, an option to tax could potentially follow significantly different legal designs, which would give rise to discrepancies in the application of the option amongst Member States. On the economic side, we show that quite generally, firms have an incentive to opt-in only on business-to-business transactions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a series}} of emerging utopian discourses that call {{for the creation of}} autonomous libertarian enclaves on land ceded by or claimed against existing states. These discourses have emerged {{in the aftermath of the}} 2008 financial crisis and can be seen as a response to the crisis on the part of freemarket advocates who critique previous waves of neoliberal reform for failing to radically transform the existing structures of the state. Enclave libertarianism seeks to overcome neoliberal capitalism's contradictory relationship to the liberal democratic state by rethinking the state as a "private government service provider" and rethinking citizens as mobile consumers of government services. Citizens are thus called to "vote with their feet" by <b>opting-in</b> to the jurisdiction that best fits their needs and beliefs. The paper argues that these utopian imaginaries are key to understanding specific new manifestations of post-crisis neoliberalism, and calls for more research into the diversity of discourses and imaginaries that circulate through networks of neoliberal actors beyond specific policy initiatives...|$|E
40|$|There are {{considerable}} {{differences in}} the number of organ donations between countries. It is assumed that opting-out systems have a significantly positive impact on the national organ donation rate. The aim of our study was to establish whether different consent systems explain the difference in organ donation rates between countries when taking into account the difference in relevant mortality rates. For this study, we compared data on donation and relevant mortality rates for 10 different countries as well as information on the existing consent systems. This international comparative study shows that there is a strong correlation between mortality rates and donation rates (Spearman's rho = 0. 81 (P < 0. 01). International comparative legal research has shown that the differences between decision systems are marginal. When the national organ donation rates are corrected for mortality rates, these findings are confirmed: the donor efficiency rate shows that opting-out systems do not automatically guarantee higher donation rates than <b>opting-in</b> system...|$|E
40|$|ADInternational audienceGender gaps in {{employment}} and wages have decreased over the past decades, especially once we control for observable characteristics. However, women are still underrepresented in high paid jobs, and this is largely the result of lower promotion rates. Our study on French academic economists, whose promotion to senior positions occurs through a national contest, finds that women {{are not subject to}} discrimination during the promotion contests. Instead, female academics are between 30 and 40 % less likely than men to enter these contests. We also find that this application gap is not due to a higher cost of promotion for women nor to women having a different trade-off between wages and department prestige than men, which leaves the expectation of discrimination and a dislike for entering competitions as the sole possible explanations. Long-term public policy can aim at encouraging self-confidence in girls so as to eventually make women as competitive as men. In the short term, making the application gap public knowledge so as to change women’s expectations of discrimination or making candidatures automatic, substituting the <b>opting-in</b> by an opting-out system, could reduce the gender gap in promotion...|$|E

To this end, the article deals with the application, limitation and interpretation of the rights in the Bill of Rights and its interface with the various organ procurement methods in the context of a discussion of applicable legislation and relevant case law.

40|$|Introduction This article {{reports the}} {{findings}} from the interviews with the main United Kingdom faith and belief leaders which were commissioned by the Organ Donation Taskforce as part of its evidence gathering when exploring the potential impact of an opt-out system for organ donation. Methodology 17 interviews were arranged with the main faith and belief organisations within the United Kingdom. Interviews covered a range of issues related to organ donation and opt-in and opt-out. Results The majority of faith and belief leaders are supportive of the opt-in system, and favour retaining it over the introduction of an opt-out system. Whilst the shortcomings of the current system are recognised, the majority felt that there is scope to make improvements without changing legislation. Conclusion In order to achieve better engagement on organ donation with members of faith and belief groups in the future, it will be important to continue the dialogue that has begun with these interviews. It is important not only for the public {{to be aware of the}} position of faith and belief leaders, but also just as important for the medical profession and policy makers to recognise that all United Kingdom faith and belief leaders interviewed wish organ donation and transplantation to be a success. <b>Opting-in</b> Opting-out Organ donation Religion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Over {{the past}} few years, a large and ever increas-ing number of Web sites have {{incorporated}} one or more social login platforms and have encouraged users to log in with their Facebook, Twitter, Google, or other social networking iden-tities. Research results suggest that {{more than two million}} Web sites have already adopted Facebook’s social login plat-form, and the number is increasing sharply. Although one might theoretically refrain from such social login features and cross-site interactions, usage statistics show that more than 250 million people might not fully realize the privacy implications of <b>opting-in.</b> To make matters worse, certain Web sites do not offer even the minimum of their functional-ity unless users meet their demands for information and social interaction. At the same time, in a large number of cases, it is unclear why these sites require all that personal informa-tion for their purposes. In this paper, we mitigate this prob-lem by designing and developing a framework for minimum information disclosure in social login interactions with third-party sites. Our example case is Facebook, which combines a very popular single sign-on platform with information-rich social networking profiles. Whenever users want to browse to a Web site that requires authentication or social interaction using a Facebook identity, our system employs, by default, a Facebook session that reveals the minimum amount of infor-mation necessary.

Such personal data is used to {{enhance the quality of}} service via personalization of content and to maximize revenues via better targeting of advertisements and deeper engagement of users on sites. To date, service providers have largely followed the approach of either requiring or requesting consent for <b>opting-in</b> to share their data. Users may be willing to share private information in return for better quality of service or for incentives, or in return for assurances about the nature and extend of the logging of data. We introduce stochastic privacy, a new approach to privacy centering on a simple concept: A guarantee is provided to users about the upper-bound on the probability that their personal data will be used. Such a probability, which we refer to as privacy risk, can be assessed by users as a preference or communicated as a policy by a service provider. Service providers can work to personalize and to optimize revenues in accordance with preferences about privacy risk. We present procedures, proofs, and an overall system for maximizing the quality of services, while respecting bounds on allowable or communicated privacy risk. We demonstrate the methodology with a case study and evaluation of the procedures applied to web search personalization. We show how we can achieve near-optimal utility of accessing information with provable guarantees on the probability of sharing data...|$|E
40|$|Many {{families}} deny organ {{recovery from}} recently deceased relatives. As a result, valuable organs {{and some of}} the lives they could save are lost. Several plans designed to rectify this tragic situation have been proposed, including organ sales. We suggest another approach that we believe to be superior and that is rarely discussed: routine recovery of all transplantable cadaveric organs without consent. Here we show that this plan is ethically acceptable, more equitable than our current <b>opting-in</b> approach, consistent with other mandatory social programs, and life-saving. Based on these considerations, we believe {{that it is time to}} eliminate entirely the consent requirement for recovery of transplantable cadaveric organs. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 2 : 300 – 303, 2007. doi: 10. 2215 /CJN. 03260906 T ransplant candidates and the people who care for themknow only too well that there is a severe shortage ofacceptable organs. As a result, in the United States alone, approximately 19 people on the transplant waiting list die every day (1). Compounding this tragedy is the fact that many potentially life-saving cadaverica organs are not pro-cured (2). Clearly, our organ procurement system fails to meet our needs. Recognition of this failure has led to several radical proposals designed to increase the number of organs that are recovered for transplantation, including legalization of organ sales (3) and offering priority status to people who agree to posthumous organ recovery (4). But before reaching for a new approach, we need to ask first, “What is wrong with our current cadaveric organ procurement system?...|$|E
40|$|Background: Recruitment of {{representative}} samples {{in primary care}} research is essential to ensure high-quality, generalisable results. This is particularly important for research using routinely recorded patient data to examine the delivery of care. Yet {{little is known about}} how different recruitment strategies influence the characteristics of the practices included in research. We describe three approaches for recruiting practices to data sharing studies, examining differences in recruitment levels and practice representativeness. Method: We examined three studies that included varying populations of practices from West Yorkshire, UK. All used anonymised patient data to explore aspects of clinical practice. Recruitment strategies were ‘opt-in’, ‘mixed opt-in and opt-out’, and ‘opt-out’. We compared aggregated practice data between recruited and not-recruited practices for practice list size, deprivation, chronic disease management, patient experience and rates of unplanned hospital admission. Results: The opt-out strategy had the highest recruitment (80 %), followed by mixed (70 %), and opt-in (58 %). Practices <b>opting-in</b> were larger (median 7153 vs. 4722 patients, p= 0. 03) than practices that declined to opt-in. Practices recruited by mixed approach were larger (median 7091 vs. 5857 patients, p= 0. 04) and had differences in the clinical quality measure (58. 4 % vs 53. 9 % of diabetic patients with HbA 1 c <= 59 mmol/mol, p< 0. 01). We found no differences between practices recruited and not-recruited using the opt-out strategy for any demographic or quality-of-care measures. Conclusion: Opt-out recruitment appears to be a relatively efficient approach to ensuring participation of typical general practices. Researchers should, with appropriate ethical safeguards, consider opt-out recruitment of practices for studies involving anonymised patient data sharing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Over {{the past}} few months we are seeing a large and ever {{increasing}} number of Web sites encouraging users to log in with their Facebook, Twitter, or Gmail identity, or personalize their browsing experience through a set of plug-ins that interact with the users ’ social profile. Research results suggest that more than two million Web sites have already adopted Facebook’s social plug-ins, and the number is increasing sharply. Although one might theoretically refrain from such single sign-on platforms and cross-site interactions, usage statistics show that more than 250 million people might not fully realize the privacy implications of <b>opting-in.</b> To make matters worse, certain Web sites do not offer even the minimum of their functionality unless the users meet their demands for information and social interaction.

Our example case is Facebook, which combines a very popular single sign-on platform with information-rich social networking profiles. When a user wants to browse a Web site that requires authentication or social interaction with his Facebook identity, our system employs, by default, a Facebook session that reveals the minimum amount of information necessary. The user has the option to explicitly elevate that Facebook session in a manner that reveals more or all of the information tied to his social identity. This enables users to disclose the minimum possible amount of personal information during their browsing experience on third-party Web sites. ...|$|E
40|$|In October 2009, the Commission of the European Union {{published}} its {{proposal for}} a regulation dealing with the private international law aspects of succession. Towards {{the end of last}} year, the UK Government exercised its right not to opt-in to the Regulation at that stage. This thesis examines the reasons behind the UK’s decision not to opt-in and considers the possible ways in which the UK’s concerns might be addressed {{during the course of the}} on-going negotiations. In doing this, the thesis will discuss the main points of contention in the regulation, which evidence a gulf between the English common law and the civil law of continental Europe, and how this might be overcome. This thesis attempts to illustrate that the current intransigence of some Member States as regards certain aspects of the regulation shows a disregard for the historical evolution of the civilian legal tradition in those countries. By emphasising the historical development of such civilian concepts as forced heirship and domicile, this thesis suggests that there is greater scope for a compromise solution than has been envisaged until now. By a similar token, domestic reform within the UK indicates that there is room for manoeuvre within the common-law approach to succession. Based on this, the thesis argues for more flexible negotiating positions during discussions relating to the Regulation. Overall, the conclusion that the thesis draws is that problems relating to claw-back and the connecting factor(s), in particular, are not insurmountable. It asserts that a greater cognizance of history coupled with an increased awareness of the failings of domestic regimes can lead to compromises which would ultimately promote a more acceptable regulation to which the UK would feel more comfortable <b>opting-in...</b>|$|E
40|$|To {{gain insight}} into how {{pregnant}} women experience serum screening for Down syndrome, we sent questionnaires to two groups of relevant subjects {{in the north of}} the Netherlands. The questionnaires addressed the following issues: decision-making process, knowledge and opinions. Questionnaire A was sent to women of 36 years of age and older (n = 99) (group A) who were all 20 to 36 weeks pregnant at that time. In the Netherlands prenatal diagnosis is routinely available to these women. Questionnaire B was sent to women of younger than 36 years (n = 69) (group B) who had received a screen-positive result and had subsequently undergone amniocentesis. About half of these women were still pregnant at that time. For these women, serum screening is only available on the basis of <b>opting-in.</b> The two questionnaires were largely identical. The response rates to questionnaires A and B were 82 % and 91 %, respectively. Group A (women of 36 years and older) considered that second trimester serum screening made a welcome contribution to the decision-making process about whether to undergo amniocentesis. Moreover, it reduced the amniocentesis rate considerably. The vast majority said they would apply for serum screening in a following pregnancy, but favoured the idea of first trimester screening. In group B (women of younger than 36 years), reassurance was the most commonly mentioned reason for undergoing serum screening. Almost all the women experienced some degree of anxiety when they were informed about the screen-positive result and 13 % continued to be anxious, even after the favourable result of the amniocentesis. The majority of the respondents would also apply for serum screening in a following pregnancy and were of the opinion that this screening should be offered to all pregnant women in the Netherlands.

The best stuff on the Web is still available but hidden behind error messages, unlisted databases, and little-known links. Most of cyberspace is still open for educated research, and serendipity. Valuable content may remain free as long as the emerging online business communication keeps on offering us an attractive compromise in matters of our time-use while on the net. This is a tacit give and take but the outcome belongs to the core drivers of the new economy. Online marketing and commerce proceed on a market of clicks not just users mouse clicks but also the clicks of third party meters counting time; adding up to statistical profiles; and measuring user behaviour.

40|$|High school {{graduation}} {{serves as an}} important gateway to increased professional opportunities. Not only does a high school graduate improve the national economy, {{a high school diploma}} is the key to opening the door to college. However, obtaining a high school degree does not necessarily ensure college readiness. In fact, many high school graduates are not prepared for college coursework, but still apply to and attend college in our college for all system. The class of 2013 saw only 38 percent of students test at a level considered prepared for college on the reading portion of the NAEP, but the problem is 66 percent of these students went on to enroll in college (Petrilli, 2016). In order to rectify this situation of unprepared students entering post-secondary education, colleges have implemented developmental coursework policies to prepare students for college-level coursework. Here, we add to the literature by examining the impacts of developmental coursework on students at Arkansas’s flagship public institution. We use a regression discontinuity design to examine multiple bandwidths of student-level observations for first-time enrollees from 2003 - 2014. The full sample includes 40, 395 first-time enrollees for the time period of interest, 92 percent reported scores {{for each of the three}} ACT sections that determine recommendation for remediation. Using marginal effects to predict outcomes, we find that students recommended to developmental math courses are less likely to persist in college and less likely to graduate in 4 years after enrollment. We find that students recommended for developmental English coursework were more likely to persist into the second semester and year of college but were less likely to graduate in 4 years. We conclude that developmental coursework at the University of Arkansas, while having mixed impacts on students, could be due to the quality of student choosing to attend the state’s flagship institution and the state’s policies tied to <b>opting-in</b> and placing-out of developmental courses...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{definition}} of elite media arguing their content focus will sufficiently meet social responsibility needs of democracy. Its assumptions come from the Finkelstein and Leveson Inquiries and regulatory British Royal Charter (2013). These provide guidelines on how media outlets meet ‘social responsibility’ standards, e. g. press has a ‘responsibility {{to be fair and}} accurate’ (Finkelstein); ethical press will feel a responsibility to ‘hold power to account’ (Leveson); news media ‘will be held strictly accountable’ (RC). The paper invokes the British principle of media <b>opting-in</b> to observe standards, and so serve the democracy. It will give examples from existing media, and consider social responsibility of media more generally. Obvious cases of ‘quality’ media: public broadcasters, e. g. BBC, Al-Jazeera, and ‘quality’ press, e. g. NYT, Süddeutscher Zeitung, but also community broadcasters, specialised magazines, news agencies, distinctive web logs, and others. Where providing commentary, these abjure gratuitous opinion [...] meeting a standard of reasoned, informational and fair. Funding is almost a definer, many such services supported by the state, private trusts, public institutions or volunteering by staff. Literature supporting discussion on elite media will include their identity as primarily committed to a public good, e. g. the ‘Public Value Test’, Moe and Donders (2011); with reference also to recent literature on developing public service media. Within its limits the paper will treat social media as participants among all media, including elite, and as a parallel dimension of mass communication founded on inter-activity. Elite media will fulfil the need for social responsibility, firstly by providing one space, a ‘plenary’ for debate. Second is the notion of building public recognition of elite media as trustworthy. Third is the fact that elite media together are a large sector with resources to sustain social cohesion and debate; notwithstanding pressure on funds, and impacts of digital transformation undermining employment in media more than in most industries...|$|E
40|$|Organ {{donation}} after {{cessation of}} circulation and respiration, both controlled and uncontrolled, {{has been proposed}} by the Institute of Medicine {{as a way to}} increase opportunities for organ procurement. Despite claims to the contrary, both forms of controlled and uncontrolled donation after cardiac death raise significant ethical and legal issues. Identified causes for concern include absence of agreement on criteria for the declaration of death, nonexistence of universal guidelines for duration before stopping resuscitation efforts and techniques, and assumption of presumed intent to donate for the purpose of initiating temporary organ-preservation interventions when no expressed consent to donate is present. From a legal point of view, not having scientifically valid criteria of cessation of circulation and respiration for declaring death could lead to a conclusion that organ procurement itself is the proximate cause of death. Although the revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 2006 provides broad immunity to those involved in organ-procurement activities, courts have yet to provide an opinion on whether persons can be held liable for injuries arising from the determination of death itself. Preserving organs in uncontrolled donation after cardiac death requires the administration of life-support systems such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. These life-support systems can lead to return of signs of life that, in turn, have to be deliberately suppressed by the administration of pharmacological agents. Finally, allowing temporary organ-preservation interventions without expressed consent is inherently a violation of the principle of respect for a person's autonomy. Proponents of organ donation from uncontrolled donation after cardiac death, on the other hand, claim that these nonconsensual interventions enhance respect for autonomy by allowing people, through surrogate decision making, to execute their right to donate organs. However, the lack of transparency and the absence of protection of individual autonomy, for the sake of maximizing procurement opportunities, have placed the current organ-donation system of <b>opting-in</b> in great jeopardy. Equally as important, current policies enabling and enhancing organ procurement practices, pose challenges to the constitutional rights of individuals in a pluralistic society as these policies are founded on flawed medical standards for declaring death...|$|E
