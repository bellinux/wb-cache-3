5000|$|Considering light {{which is}} {{scattered}} {{only once in}} the atmosphere, the light received by the instrument at surface is contributed by light scattered downward from all the levels in the atmosphere. The amount of light contributed by scattering at any particular level depends on (a) the number of air molecules at that level and (b) the absorption by ozone and scattering by air moleculaes {{both before and after}} scattering. As the height increases contribution of effect (a) decreases and contribution of effect (b) increases. For a given zenith angle, the scattered light contribution comes from well defined layer of atmosphere, which can be termed as an effective scattering height. The effective scattering height depends on the ozone absorption coefficient and on the solar zenith angle, increasing as with each of these. The effective scattering height will always be higher for shorter wavelength which is more strongly absorbed. As the sun approaches the horizon, the two intensities decreases, but intensity I decreasing more rapidly than I [...] However, when the effective scattering height for the short wavelength is above the <b>ozone</b> <b>maximum,</b> I decreases more slowly than I , because the ozone absorption occurs mostly in the shorter vertical path after the scattering event, and the ratio I/I increases until the effective scattering height for I [...] is also above the <b>ozone</b> <b>maximum.</b> This reversal (Umkehr) or inversion implies the existence of maximum of ozone concentration at some level in the atmosphere.|$|E

The modelled results are examined at the surface and {{on a series of}} time-height cross sections at several locations spread over the Atlantic, the Indian, and the Pacific Oceans. Comparison of model with surface measurements at remote MBL stations indicate a close agreement. The most striking feature of the hemispheric spring <b>ozone</b> <b>maximum</b> in the MBL can be most easily identified at the NH sites of Westman Island, Bermuda, and Mauna Loa, and at the SH site of Samoa. Modelled ozone vertical distributions in the troposphere are compared with ozone profiles. For the Atlantic and the Indian sites, the model generally produces a hemispheric spring <b>ozone</b> <b>maximum</b> close to those of the measurements. The model also produces a spring <b>ozone</b> <b>maximum</b> in the northeastern and tropical north Pacific close to those measurements, and at sites in the NH high latitudes. The good agreement between model and measurements indicate that the model can reproduce the proposed mechanisms responsible for producing the spring <b>ozone</b> <b>maximum</b> in these regions of the MBL, lending confidence {{in the use of the}} model to investigate MBL ozone chemistry (see part 2 and part 3). The spring <b>ozone</b> <b>maximum</b> in the tropical central south Pacific and eastern equatorial Pacific are less well reproduced by the model, indicating that both the transport of $O_ 3 $ precursors from biomass burning emissions taking place in southeastern Asia, Australia, Oceania, southern Africa, and South America are not well represented in the model in these regions. Overall, the model produces a better simulation at sites where the stratosphere and biomass burning emissions are the major contributors. Comment: 24 pages, 8 figure...|$|E

Turbulence in the nocturnal boundary layer was shown to be weak and intermittent. Vertical profiles of Richardson number and ozone concentration indicated that the temporary turbulent coupling of the residual layer to the surface layer facilitated the transport of ozone stored aloft to the surface. Despite the overall complexity of the system, results show that seven out of the 19 ozone spikes observed at the Aldergrove site coincided with turbulence associated with the development of the down-valley wind system.

We show that both TES and GOME- 2 are able to detect enhanced levels of ozone in the lower troposphere over the region during the summer. These observations, together with surface measurements, are used to evaluate the TOMCAT model's ability to capture the observed ozone enhancement. The model is used to quantify contributions to the <b>ozone</b> <b>maximum</b> from anthropogenic and natural volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, anthropogenic NOx emissions, wildfire emissions and long-range import of ozone and precursors. Our results show a dominance of natural VOC emissions on ozone in the Mediterranean Basin over anthropogenic VOC emissions.

We also show that in the lower troposphere, global VOC emissions account for 40 % of the VOC contribution to ozone in the region, whereas, for NOx the global contribution is only 10 % at these altitudes. However, in the mid and upper troposphere almost all of the ozone comes from long-range transport for all emission sources.
