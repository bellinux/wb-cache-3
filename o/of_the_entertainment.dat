5|$|Games {{are played}} for entertainment—{{sometimes}} purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They {{can be played}} alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>entertainment</b> for children playing a game is deciding who {{is part of their}} audience and who is a player.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>entertainment</b> industry has been the creation of new types of employment.

5|$|An {{estimated}} 13 {{million people}} went whale watching globally in 2008, in all oceans except the Arctic. Rules and {{codes of conduct}} have been created to minimize harassment of the whales. Iceland, Japan and Norway have both whaling and whale watching industries. Whale watching lobbyists {{are concerned that the}} most inquisitive whales, which approach boats closely and provide much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>entertainment</b> on whale-watching trips, {{will be the first to}} be taken if whaling is resumed in the same areas. Whale watching generated US$2.1 billion (UK£1.4 billion) per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers. In contrast, the whaling industry, with the moratorium in place, generates US$31 million (UK£20 million) per year. The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource.|$|E

5|$|The game {{received}} mixed reviews. Critics {{praised the}} game's B movie-esque quality, warped humor, and smooth video animation, but criticized the shallow gameplay. The title is particularly notable for {{being one of}} the principal subjects of a 1993 United States Senate committee hearing on violent video games, along with Mortal Kombat. Night Trap was cited during the hearing as promoting gratuitous violence and sexual aggression against women. Toy retailers pulled the game from shelves that December, and Sega withdrew the game from the market by January. The Senate hearing eventually led to the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Entertainment</b> Software Ratings Board (ESRB), the North American video game ratings board still used today. After the controversy subsided, Night Trap was re-released and ported to other consoles. These later ports received more harsh reviews due to the aging appeal of full motion video. A re-release of Night Trap in celebration of its 25th anniversary was released on August 15, 2017.|$|E
