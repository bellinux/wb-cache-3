5|$|Arthur Koblenz Dallas (Tom Skerritt) is {{the captain}} of the Nostromo and the <b>only</b> <b>human</b> crew member with access to Mother, the onboard computer. When he {{receives}} a distress signal from the Derelict, an Engineer ship, Dallas steers the Nostromo off course to investigate the beacon. After the Alien hatches from Gilbert Kane's chest and murders Samuel Brett, Dallas enters the ship's air ducts to lure it to the airlock and eject it into space. He is attacked by the Alien and disappears – presumed dead – leaving only his flamethrower.|$|E

5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} {{of the virus}} to {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface of}} the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects <b>only</b> <b>human</b> T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.|$|E

5|$|Hatoful Boyfriend is an {{interactive}} text-based visual novel that follows a branching plot line, with the player's decisions determining {{which of the}} game's multiple endings they receive. The title is a pun on the wasei-eigo word , and the Japanese word , as the game features pigeons and other birds as major characters. The game {{is set in a}} version of Earth populated by sapient birds, and its main story follows the player character and protagonist—the <b>only</b> <b>human</b> attending St. PigeoNation's Institute, an elite school for birds—as she finds love among her avian acquaintances.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} Hatoful Boyfriend {{begin in the}} year 2188, when the protagonist, a teenage human girl invited to attend the prestigious bird-only St. PigeoNation's Institute, starts her second year of high school. After a hectic and surreal {{freshman}} year of attendance at St. PigeoNation's, the protagonist has grown accustomed to the confusion of being the <b>only</b> <b>human</b> in a school full of birds, and {{is looking forward to}} her sophomore year. The story of the dating simulation portion of the game follows the protagonist, and the inter-species love and hijinks—of both the mundane high school and quasi-anthropomorphic bird-specific varieties—that ensue as she draws the attention of and attempts to romance {{one of a number of}} eligible birds she comes in contact with over the course of the year.|$|E
5|$|After {{the player}} defeats the Elite Four {{and enters the}} Champion's chamber, he or she finds that N has {{defeated}} Alder and become the newest Pokémon Champion. Soon after, he summons a large castle that surrounds the Pokémon League, challenging the player to find him {{to take part in}} one final battle. When the player finally reaches him, Reshiram in Black or Zekrom in White appears before the player, and the player must capture the legendary Pokémon before challenging N. After his defeat, N laments the possibility that his ideals are mistaken, Ghetsis intrudes and angrily reveals that his true intentions were to use N to ensure that he would be the <b>only</b> <b>human</b> left with control over Pokémon and use them to rule the world. In his rage, Ghetsis challenges the player to battle. After Ghetsis's defeat, he is arrested, allowing Alder to resume his position as the Pokémon Champion of the Unova region. N then thanks the player for helping realize his mistake {{about the nature of the}} relationship between people and their Pokémon before leaving the castle on his captured Pokémon to a far-off land.|$|E

5|$|Charles Darwin {{was aware}} of the severe {{reaction}} {{in some parts of the}} scientific community against the suggestion made in Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation that humans had arisen from animals by a process of transmutation. Therefore, he almost completely ignored the topic of human evolution in On the Origin of Species. Despite this precaution, the issue featured prominently in the debate that followed the book's publication. For most of the first half of the 19th century, the scientific community believed that, although geology had shown that the Earth and life were very old, human beings had appeared suddenly just a few thousand years before the present. However, a series of archaeological discoveries in the 1840s and 1850s showed stone tools associated with the remains of extinct animals. By the early 1860s, as summarized in Charles Lyell's 1863 book Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man, it had become widely accepted that humans had existed during a prehistoric period—which stretched many thousands of years before the start of written history. This view of human history was more compatible with an evolutionary origin for humanity than was the older view. On the other hand, at that time there was no fossil evidence to demonstrate human evolution. The <b>only</b> <b>human</b> fossils found before the discovery of Java Man in the 1890s were either of anatomically modern humans or of Neanderthals that were too close, especially in the critical characteristic of cranial capacity, to modern humans for them to be convincing intermediates between humans and other primates.|$|E

50|$|Clayton {{has made}} major {{contributions}} {{in the study of}} animal cognition as well as cognitive development in human children, with significant impact in the neurobiology of memory and overall cognitive development.5 Her expertise in the study of comparative cognition integrates a knowledge of both biology and psychology in providing new methods of thinking about the evolution and development of intelligence in non-verbal animals and pre-verbal children. Clayton studies cognition not <b>only</b> in <b>humans</b> but also in members of the crow family (including jackdaws, rooks and jays). This work has challenged many assumptions that <b>only</b> <b>humans</b> can reminisce about the past and plan for the future, and that <b>only</b> <b>humans</b> can understand other times as well as other minds. Her work has also led to a re-evaluation of the cognitive capacities of animals, specifically birds, and resulted in a theory that intelligence evolved independently in at least two groups, the apes and the crows.|$|R
