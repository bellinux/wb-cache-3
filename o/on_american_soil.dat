5|$|At the World Group {{first round}} tie against the United States in San Diego, Murray {{defeated}} Donald Young and James Ward unexpectedly beat Sam Querrey {{on the first}} day. On the last day, Murray beat Sam Querrey to put Great Britain into {{the quarterfinals of the}} Davis Cup {{for the first time since}} 1986. Britain's only previous victory <b>on</b> <b>American</b> <b>soil</b> was 111 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Brock {{arrived in}} Canada {{with the rest}} of the 49th foot and was {{initially}} assigned to Montreal. Almost immediately, in 1804 he was faced with one of the primary problems in Canada: desertion. Seven soldiers stole a boat and fled across the river (and border) into the United States. Despite having no jurisdiction <b>on</b> <b>American</b> <b>soil,</b> Brock sent a party across the border in pursuit and the men were captured.|$|E

50|$|The {{last war}} {{to be fought}} <b>on</b> South <b>American</b> <b>soil</b> was the Falkland War between Argentina and the United Kingdom for {{possession}} of the islands of the same name. Argentina was defeated in 1982.|$|R
5|$|In 1687, William Penn {{published}} The Excellent Privilege of Liberty and Property: {{being the}} birth-right of the Free-Born Subjects of England, which contained the first copy of Magna Carta printed <b>on</b> <b>American</b> <b>soil.</b> Penn's comments reflected Coke's, indicating {{a belief that}} Magna Carta was a fundamental law. The colonists drew on English law books, leading them to an anachronistic interpretation of Magna Carta, believing that it guaranteed trial by jury and habeas corpus.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Gifu {{also served}} as the base for the {{creation}} of Japan's fire balloons. These paper-based, bomb-carrying hot air balloons were used in a failed attempt to cause havoc <b>on</b> <b>American</b> <b>soil.</b> Local high school girls made these fire balloons out of Mino washi (a thin but strong Japanese paper) and konnyaku paste. Originally, rubberized silk was used to help these bombs use the newly discovered jet stream to traverse the Pacific Ocean, but Gifu's paper was found to be both stronger, lighter, and more airtight.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{competition}} at Westminster {{was restricted to}} champions only. A dog can only become a champion by gaining championship points at other conformation shows. Prior to 1992, admission to dogs was open, and in 1938 an English Setter named Daro of Maridor was the Best in Show title at Westminster in his very first outing at a dog show {{at the age of}} 11 months. In 1929, a previously unregistered British dog won at Westminster using the name Laund Loyalty of Bellhaven, aged nine months in his only show <b>on</b> <b>American</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Federal Government, however, as we insist, has {{the power}} of {{restraining}} {{the extension of the}} institution--the power to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur <b>on</b> any <b>American</b> <b>soil</b> which is now free from slavery.|$|R
50|$|Race {{has been}} {{a factor in the}} United States {{criminal}} justice system since the system's beginnings, as the nation was founded <b>on</b> Native <b>American</b> <b>soil.</b> It continues to be a factor throughout United States history through the present.|$|R
25|$|In the 1990s, Gilliam {{directed}} a trilogy of Americana: The Fisher King (1991), 12 Monkeys (1995), and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), which played <b>on</b> North <b>American</b> <b>soil</b> and, while still surreal, had less fantastical plots than his previous trilogy.|$|R
5|$|On December 2, 1896, Earp was {{a last-minute}} choice as referee for a boxing match that the {{promoters}} {{billed as the}} heavyweight championship of the world. Bob Fitzsimmons was set to fight Tom Sharkey {{that night at the}} Mechanics' Pavilion in San Francisco. Earp had refereed 30 or so matches in earlier days, though not under the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, but under the older and more liberal London Prize Ring Rules. The fight may have been the most anticipated fight <b>on</b> <b>American</b> <b>soil</b> that year. Fitzsimmons was favored to win, and the public and even civic officials placed bets on the outcome.|$|E
5|$|When Häyhänen {{announced}} {{himself at}} the embassy on 4 May, he appeared drunk. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officials at the Paris embassy did not find Häyhänen's story credible. They weren't convinced he might actually be a Russian spy until he produced a hollow Finnish 5-mark coin. Upon opening the coin a square of microfilm was revealed. On May 11, the CIA returned him to the United States and handed {{him over to the}} FBI. As a member of a Soviet spy ring operating <b>on</b> <b>American</b> <b>soil,</b> Häyhänen came under the FBI's jurisdiction and they began verifying his story.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Smoking Man was an {{aspiring}} writer of espionage (and later, science-fiction) novels starring a fictional version of himself, Jack Colquitt, {{and based on}} his own secret activities, but all his drafts were rejected or altered by publishers who found them unrealistic and poorly written. This left him {{no choice but to}} continue working for the United States government. By 1991, the Smoking Man's power was pretty much absolute. He was in direct talks with Saddam Hussein and involved {{in one way or another}} on the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy, moving the Rodney King trial to Simi Valley, keeping the US government from interferring in the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Academy Awards nominations, keeping the Buffalo Bills from ever winning the Super Bowl, drugging the Soviet goalkeeper before the Miracle on Ice, and executing extraterrestrials that survived landing <b>on</b> <b>American</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
50|$|There is {{also another}} migration-related issue: during the 1960s, several Uruguayans {{migrated}} to the United States and had their children <b>on</b> North <b>American</b> <b>soil.</b> Lately, {{there are many of}} those people returning to Uruguay, so there are American-born children and young people who are now living in Uruguay.|$|R
50|$|Cémaco, {{together}} with his warriors, abandoned the town {{and headed for the}} jungle. The Spanish plundered the houses and gathered a treasure-trove of golden ornaments. Balboa kept his vow, and, in September 1510, founded the first permanent settlement <b>on</b> mainland <b>American</b> <b>soil,</b> and called it Santa María la Antigua del Darién.|$|R
50|$|This summit {{gathered}} together {{the leaders of}} all {{the countries of the}} American continent, except Cuba. Major security arrangements and massive popular protests against the presence of the President of the United States, George W. Bush, <b>on</b> Latin <b>American</b> <b>soil,</b> took place {{in the days leading up}} to the summit.|$|R
5|$|In 1681, King Charles II gave Penn a {{large piece}} of his newly {{acquired}} American land holdings to repay a debt the king owed to Admiral Sir William Penn, Penn's father. This land included present-day Pennsylvania and Delaware, though the claim as written would create a bloody conflict with Maryland (dubbed Cresap's War) over the land grant already owned by Lord Baltimore. Penn put together a colonial expedition and fleet, which set out for America {{in the middle of the}} following summer. Penn, sailing in the vanguard, first set foot <b>on</b> <b>American</b> <b>soil</b> at the colony at New Castle, Delaware. An orderly change of government ensued, as was normal in an age used to the privileges and prerogatives of aristocracy and which antedated nationalism: the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new Proprietor. The first Pennsylvania General Assembly was soon held in the colony.|$|E
5|$|Deep Purple {{arrived in}} California on 15 October 1968 and their first public {{appearance}} <b>on</b> <b>American</b> <b>soil</b> was at The Dating Game TV show on ABC on 17 October. They {{were the first}} rock band to perform on the show, where Jon Lord {{was one of the}} contestants. The next two days the band played live in the US {{for the first time as}} supporting act of Cream in their Goodbye tour. The concerts were held at the Inglewood Forum near Los Angeles, California, in front of more than 16,000 people every night. Recordings of those live shows were issued in 2002 as Inglewood – Live in California. The next gig at San Diego was the last one supporting Cream, whose management apparently did not appreciate the cheerful reaction of the audience to Deep Purple and dropped them. After a week of forced stop, their American manager succeeded in setting up a tour which included the San Francisco International Pop Festival and venues on the West Coast. This opportunity was very useful for the young musicians, who as headliners could lengthen their live shows up to 90 minutes and gained much needed experience on the road. This was particularly true for Blackmore, who developed and extended his guitar solos, incorporating more improvisations.|$|E
5|$|The Oklahoma City {{bombing was}} a {{domestic}} terrorist truck bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing killed 168 people, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed {{one-third of the}} building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated $652million worth of damage. Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies {{in the wake of}} the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated eleven of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations. The Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack <b>on</b> <b>American</b> <b>soil</b> until the September 11 attacks six years later, and it still remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in United States history.|$|E
50|$|African-American {{self-determination}} {{refers to}} efforts to secure self-determination for African-Americans and related peoples in North America. It often intersects with the historic Back-to-Africa movement and general Black separatism, but also manifests in present and historic demands for self-determination <b>on</b> North <b>American</b> <b>soil,</b> ranging from autonomy to independence. Reparations for slavery and other oppressions {{are often a}} key demand for advocates of African-American self-determination.|$|R
50|$|In March 1944 the {{regiment}} departed Trinidad arriving in New York in 1944, {{the first time}} {{the regiment}}al colors arrived <b>on</b> Continental <b>American</b> <b>soil.</b> The regiment was assigned to Camp Claiborne Louisiana and assigned to the Fourth United States Army. Many of the regiment volunteered for Merrill's Marauders and were sent to Burma as the 2nd Battalion 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional). The regiment was inactivated on 26 June 1944.|$|R
50|$|Kirillov {{received}} his master's {{degree from the}} Moscow State University in 1989 and Ph.D from Yale University. He is currently an Associate Professor at State University of New York at Stony Brook. As his father, Kirillov also strongly involved in the advanced mathematical education of gifted schoolchildren, he is a teacher of the project School Nova, trying to establish traditions of the Russian Mathematical Schools <b>on</b> the <b>American</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|R
5|$|There {{had been}} a degree of cross-fertilization between Canadian and American leagues earlier in the 20th century. A number of CFL–NFL interleague games were held in Canada. As well, eleven neutral-site CFL games have been played <b>on</b> <b>American</b> <b>soil.</b> The {{earliest}} of these dates to 1909, while the bulk occurred between 1951 and 1967. The 1909 game, featuring the Ottawa Rough Riders and Hamilton Tigers, {{was sponsored by the}} New York Herald and played at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx; this in the era when the Canadian game was more similar to rugby football and did not feature modern rules such as the forward pass. The next game, a 1951 match-up between the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Toronto Argonauts in Buffalo, was billed as the first true all-Canadian game played in the United States and drew more than 18,000, a decent crowd for the era. In 1958, Hamilton defeated Ottawa in a regular-season contest in front about 15,000 in Philadelphia's cavernous Municipal Stadium, 24–18. It remains the only CFL game played outside Canada, involving two Canadian teams, that actually counted in the standings.|$|E

30|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold War, the US {{has become}} the undisputed global hegemon. Fukuyama (1992) was able to declare the End of History with liberal {{democracy}} as the ultimate form of governance. Ideologically claiming the moral high ground, the West set the structure of the global financial system, which is also regulated by the West, to reinforce the doctrine of liberal democracy at the expense of creating dependency in the developing world. Consequently, aid from the US is made conditional upon the recipients introducing liberal democratic reforms under the doctrine of the Washington Consensus. Yet, following the 911 terrorist attack <b>on</b> <b>American</b> <b>soils</b> in 2001, former US President George Bush had to ask “Why do they hate us?” a The US sub-prime crisis ultimately triggered the question of whether liberal democracy should be the universal norm of governances.|$|R
50|$|The Surge won the game, 21-17, behind quarterback David Archer's MVP {{performance}} (22 completions of 33 attempts for 286 yards, {{two touchdowns}} and one interception). The game {{would be the}} only World Bowl involving two North American-based WLAF teams, as well as the only World Bowl played <b>on</b> North <b>American</b> <b>soil.</b> It would also be the last game either team would play, and the last WLAF game until 1995 as the league sought to restructure.|$|R
5000|$|The first Church of England service {{recorded}} <b>on</b> North <b>American</b> <b>soil</b> was {{a celebration}} of Holy Communion at Frobisher Bay {{in the last days}} of August or early September 1578. The Anglican Church of Canada's Prayer Book fixes the day of commemoration as September 3. The chaplain on Frobisher's voyage was [...] " [...] 'Maister Wolfall (probably Robert Wolfall), minister and preacher', who had been charged by Queen Elizabeth 'to serve God twice a day'." ...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Jefferson did {{not mean}} to say, nor do I, that the power of {{emancipation}} is in the Federal Government. He spoke of Virginia; and, as to the power of emancipation, I speak of the slaveholding States only. The Federal Government, however, as we insist, has the power of restraining the extension of the institution--the power to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur <b>on</b> any <b>American</b> <b>soil</b> which is now free from slavery.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1770s, the American Revolutionary War {{began with}} the passage of the Intolerable acts, and the battles of Lexington and Concord, and Bunker Hill. von Fersen told Beaumont that in France [...] "it is the fashion to rhapsodize over the Americans' rebelliousness against England". France had officially {{declared}} war against her [...] "natural enemy" [...] (Great Britain) in February 1778, but in the beginning of 1780, a French contingent was finally being outfitted to fight with the rebels <b>on</b> North <b>American</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|R
