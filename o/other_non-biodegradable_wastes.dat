Maruti easily defeats Rahu and Ketu {{with the help of his}} army of monkeys that came to help him to get free from the hands of culprits (who caught him because he stole the mangoes from his garden). In order to stop Rahu and Ketu from {{covering}} the sun, Narada must remind Maruti that he is actually Hanuman. After Narada and Maruti met and signed a contract, Maruti became the more powerful Hanuman, with more godly powers. He also had a new appearance which he looks like child Hanuman from the film's predecessor. Then a monster made of polythene and <b>other</b> <b>non-biodegradable</b> <b>waste</b> appears from a volcano that was said to form when Sarpdansh merged with the Kamandal thrown by Shukracharya which coincidentally fell in the volcano in Bajrangpur. The monsters keeps on swallowing the villagers of Bajrangpur.After struggling to stop the monster, Hanuman asked help from God Ram. God Ram then said that when a blockage, which is seen in the end, is cleared then the monster (mainly made of plastic and other waste thrown by humans) will finish up. Hanuman did what Ram said, and the monster was defeated. Finally, Hanuman said his farewells to his family and friends and leaves Bajrangpur.|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to meet the {{requirements}} for maximum material utilization, which is set forth in the Act No. 185 / 2001 Coll. on Waste and amendments to other Acts, and to achieve the objectives of the Waste Management Plan of the Czech Republic to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill, a proposal for widespread deployment of separate collection and processing of biodegradable municipal waste in municipalities {{has become part of the}} amendment Act prepared by the ministry. In many places of the country pilot projects have been launched to test the technology and logistics of sorting, collecting, processing and utilizing biodegradable municipal waste separated by residents. Separate collection of biodegradable municipal waste in Kroměříž was launched as a pilot project in 1992. Despite all the residents’ education, the management of Biopas is not satisfied with the quality of biodegradable waste separation; problems occur especially in the residential area. Biodegradable waste separated by residents, due to its unacceptable amount of impurities, is transported to the landfill Kuchyňky near the village Zdounky 10 km distant but detailed data on the amount of impurities in separate biodegradable municipal waste were missing. Therefore an analysis of separate biodegradable municipal waste has been carried out. Individual samples were collected within two days of separate waste delivery, without any modifications (scattering, compaction). The sample size was at least 200 [*]kg, the sample was manually sorted according to the Catalogue of Waste into biodegradable <b>waste</b> (200201), <b>other</b> <b>non-biodegradable</b> <b>waste</b> (200203) and biodegradable waste unsuitable for composting (e. g. animal by-products). It was found that the amount of unacceptable impurities in separate biodegradable waste considerably varies from 1 to 9 %wt. It can be concluded that the amount of unacceptable impurities in biowaste is too large to allow composting and compost production (in 2009) ...|$|R
500|$|Composting, the {{purposeful}} biodegradation {{of organic}} matter by microorganisms, [...] {{is among the most}} simple ways of treating food waste and thereby preventing it being sent to landfill. Since all biodegradable materials will eventually oxidise to become compost, the process can be undertaken at home with no running costs, although equipment can accelerate the process. Most components of food waste are putrescibles and will be broken down in a compost, however some exceptions will not (e.g. cooked foods and feces) and can attract vermin. The effectiveness of composting food waste depends on the available space (or storage capacity {{in the case of a}} compost bin) and the method of composting. Unlike in landfill, where it is mixed with <b>other</b> (<b>non-biodegradable)</b> materials, food <b>waste</b> decomposing in a compost does not release harmful gases. Similarly to compost created from other waste sources, composted food waste can be used to return nutrients to the soil if spread on the garden (see uses of compost).|$|R

30|$|Industrialization {{plays an}} {{important}} role in developing countries like India, which has large population. Rapid increase of population and per capita income directly or indirectly lead to generation of high rate of municipal solid waste (MSW). Municipal solid waste and different types of industrials wastes have severe serious impact on environment. Large amount of these wastes are extremely dangerous to living human beings and animals. These types of waste bring down the quality of ground water by leachate percolation and contaminate the surrounding soil. Municipal solid waste generally contains household refuse, industries, commercial offices, hospitals, textiles, institutional, construction, street sweeping, demolition debris, dead animals and fecal matter. These wastes contain high amount of organic material, which is highly deformable and compressible under certain loading conditions [7, 17]. Based on the organic content of municipal solid waste (MSW), it is categorized into two parts, i.e. biodegradable <b>waste</b> and <b>non-biodegradable</b> <b>waste.</b> Biodegradable waste can be easily decomposed with the help of natural agents namely oxygen, water, ultra violet rays of sun, acid rains, microorganisms, etc. These wastes include food waste like fruits peels, plants leaves and dead plants, egg shells, paper material, garden wastes, etc. In the decomposition process micro-organisms are converted to large portion of complex matter into small unit with the help of water and oxygen. Biodegradable waste decomposed in a few months or days. It also influences the geotechnical properties of soil like compressibility, permeability, shear strength and friction angle.|$|R

The intelligent application of preventative maintenance would dramatically decrease waste disposal and is estimated to save {{hundreds of billions of}} dollars annually in the United States alone. By developing new, cheap and non-labor intensive methods for assessing material quality, the potential to reduce the environmental and fiscal costs of waste disposal is increased. This thesis work is focused on developing rapid, simple, high-resolution, cost-effective technology using bacteria to detect defects and weakness in materials. To this end, described here will be: 1) advancements in the usage of Vertical ScanningInterferometry (VSI) to measure through corrosive microbes to their corroding mineral/metal interface; 2) the capacity to use several microbes in the Shewanella genus to specifically detect microscale levels of a corrosive byproduct; 3) the development of biologically interactive tools and methods that are independently capable of measuring mechanical strain fields across a wide range in materials; 4) the bioengineering of microbial biofilms to spatially resolve strain across a surface.

A stratified random sample, comprising 3047 respondents, was chosen for a questionnaire survey, covering all municipalities of Delhi, with socio-economic classification as the stratifying variable. Survey results indicate that 60 % of residents do not know the difference between biodegradable and <b>non-biodegradable</b> <b>waste,</b> and only 2 % of them segregate waste. Fifty-eight percent of respondents reported that the waste collector mixes the segregated waste, 97 % of respondents reported that they sold items to an itinerant waste buyer, and 87 % of households are covered by doorstep waste collection services. Abstract knowledge (general knowledge about waste management) is seen to have a significant correlation with willingness to engage in waste management. Differences between the socio-economic groups indicate that the highest (most educated and wealthy), as well as the lowest socio-economic category (least educated and poor), older age-groups, and women, have greater abstract knowledge.
