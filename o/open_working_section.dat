40|$|A {{scheme for}} {{reducing}} dynamic interference in wind tunnels at subsonic and transonic speeds was {{tested in a}} pilot 4 in × 4 in tunnel. Two types of dynamic interference were considered: excitation of unwanted acoustic resonances within the <b>working</b> <b>section</b> and flow unsteadiness. The tests show that both types of interference could be substantially reduced by replacing the conventional hard walls of a closed or a slotted <b>working</b> <b>section</b> by appropriate sound absorbing walls. The models used to establish the resonances in the <b>working</b> <b>sections</b> with hard walls were small circular cylinders operating in the suberitical Reynolds number range (Rd < 2 x I 05) and thus generating discrete pressure fluctuations at the vortex shedding frequency. When the resonances were suppressed by the wall material the pressure fluctuations agreed well with previous measurements made in a much larger, low speed wind tunnel, and with predictions.

40|$|The {{influence}} of {{sound on the}} type of experimental methods used in flow and heat ransfer test rigs is discussed. The type of acoustic mode that interacts most readily with the flow is described. When solid walls are present in the <b>working</b> <b>section</b> of test rigs and wind tunnels, acoustic modes can readily be excited in the <b>working</b> <b>sections</b> without he knowledge of experimenters and can lead to an erroneous interpretation of test results. Examples of the interaction between loud sounds, up to 150 dB, and the flow are described. These sounds can be generated by the flow, but in general they are easily detected since they are heard by the experimenter and alter the flow and the heat ransfer characteristics in a very obvious manner. Recent experiments at CSIRO show that sound levels between 70 and 95 dB (with corresponding ratios of the velocity due to sound to the freestream velocity of between ~ 0. 0001 and, ~ 0. 002) generated by the flow can alter both the flow and the heat ransfer characteristics in a manner not immediately obvious to the experimenter. Consequently, a microphone should always be located in the <b>working</b> <b>section</b> of a wind tunnel with the test model installed so that unwanted sound can be detected. Methods of canceling the unwanted sound in wind tunnels and test rigs are also presented...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Further {{measurements}} of turbulence in the worldng section are given with 2 and 3 screens in the bulge. The extended region of high intensity turbulence near {{the walls of}} the <b>working</b> <b>section,</b> which was observed with 9 screens in the bulge, disappeared when the number of screens was reduced from 9 to 2 or 3. The longitudinal component of turbulence is approximately independent of the nmnber of screens; the lateral component does not change, if the number of screens is reduced from 9 to 3, but increases by a factor 2. 5 to 3, if the number of screens is further reduced from 3 to 2. in order to explain the origin of the turbulence in the worldng section, further turbulence measurements have been made {{at the end of the}} second diffuser, before the rapid expansion and in the bulge. The intensities of turbulence are about 12 per cent of mean speed at the end of the second diffuser and drop to about 4 to 6 per cent b~fore the rapid expansion. However, this turbulence seems to be reduced by the screens in the rapid expansion and in the bulge below the level of disturbances set up by inhomogeneities of the last screen.
