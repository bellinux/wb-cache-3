5|$|Dysprosium iodide and {{dysprosium}} bromide {{are used}} in high-intensity metal-halide lamps. These compounds dissociate near the hot center of the lamp, releasing isolated dysprosium atoms.

5|$|Green {{is common}} in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex {{chemical}} known as chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> using bacteriorhodopsin. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> not used by the halobacteria.|$|E

Using such an unfolding the distribution tends toward a semi-Poisson distribution for longer spectra.
