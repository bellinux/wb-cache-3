5000|$|Trading {{collaboration}} is the symmetrical opposite of [...] "sourcing collaboration", {{in that it}} refers to the <b>obtainer</b> who enjoys a resource mediated by an organization but originally provided by another consumer (i.e. provider) via sourcing collaboration. The <b>obtainer</b> thus benefits from a resource that has been originally sourced by a provider to a mediator. The mediator, in turn, offers the providers' resource to the <b>obtainer,</b> usually-but not exclusively- at a cost, which will be fully, partially or not at all returned to the original provider. In contrast to conventional consumption where the resource being enjoyed, even temporarily, originates from a company, trading collaboration presupposes that the resource enjoyed by the <b>obtainer</b> has originally been sourced by another consumer. For example, trading collaboration occurs when consumer B obtains a cheaper refurbished iPhone that has been traded in to Best Buy by consumer A. Or it occurs when consumer B enjoys the delivery of her groceries by consumer A, through the Instacart crowdsourcing application.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, the {{individual}} who obtains a large package of food (in cases where this seldom happens) will face asymmetric contests over food. Thus, the <b>obtainer</b> will not benefit from fighting over less valuable portions. However, latecomers who have not obtained food on their own will have much to gain even from the less valuable portions. It is not worth the effort for a food-obtainer to fight over these portions, and so the <b>obtainer</b> {{should be expected to}} relinquish these without a fight since it would likely lose to the latecomer. Thus, another expectation is that natural selection will favor the ability to assess costs and benefits. Among frequently interacting individuals, the roles of <b>obtainer</b> and latecomer/thief will interchange, balancing out benefits of latecomer gains and <b>obtainer</b> losses (reciprocation develops to avoid injury). Equal (reciprocal) sharing is the eventual consequence from this tolerated theft behavior. When food packages are small to begin with, then theft will be less tolerated as portions will have lower returns along the assumed diminishing value curve. Hoarding is expected in cases where either food can be defended, there is a season of scarcity, a synchronous glut (ex. salmon run or agricultural harvest), or when accumulated food no longer follows a diminishing curve (ex. Financial capital). Scrounging is expected to increase among groups when active foragers miss out on sharing opportunities due to their own acts of less successful foraging. Foragers do worse than scroungers because scroungers are able to participate in 100% of sharing events.|$|E

5000|$|In July 1980, the Dance Fools Dance label {{released}} the [...] "Yeh Yeh Yeh" [...] split-release 7" [...] single by the <b>Obtainers</b> and Mag/Spys, {{from the earlier}} Morgan Studios recordings. The record contained the <b>Obtainers</b> songs [...] "Yeh Yeh Yeh" [...] and [...] "Pussy Wussy" [...] on one side, with [...] "Lifeblood" [...] and [...] "Bombs" [...] by Mag/Spys on the other. Only 100 copies of the single were pressed, hand-packaged in paper and sticker sleeves designed by Ric Gallup. Individual copies came with either red, yellow, [...] green or blue stickers, and were sold by mail order for 75 pence through the Cure's official newsletter, Clinic. Later internet sources have dated the release to 1979, possibly due to it having been recorded in 1979 with the original lineup. [...] "Lifeblood" [...] and [...] "Bombs" [...] by Mag/Spys later resurfaced on the 1998 UK punk compilation album England Belongs to Me, Vol II, issued by bootleg label 77 Records.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Obtainer</b> - The {{individual}} who seeks {{to obtain a}} resource or service that is provided directly by another consumer (i.e the provider), or indirectly through the mediation of an organization known as the [...] "mediator", which may be for-profit (e.g. Ikea's used furniture sales) or not-for-profit (e.g. The Salute's Army); ...|$|E
5000|$|Consumers may {{exchange}} {{resources and}} services directly {{with or without}} the support of an [...] "intermediary", which is an entity that facilitates the exchange between <b>obtainer</b> and provider (e.g. Kijiji, Freecycle, Yerdle). Consumers set the terms and conditions of the exchange, and this refers to pure collaboration. There are also other types of third-parties which are more heavily involved in the consumer-to-consumer relationship. These are called [...] "mediators". They determine the terms and conditions of the exchange between consumers and may typically take a predetermined proportion of the amount of value being exchanged. Examples include second-hand stores to which consumers may donate or resell goods that are then subsequently resold to other consumers. Some platforms such as Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit or Lending Club are also included. The intervention of mediators in a peer-to-peer relationship signals sourcing collaboration and its corollary trading collaboration.|$|E
5000|$|Through CC, {{consumers}} invite {{themselves in}} the value creation process, not as formal workers, employees or suppliers, but as informal suppliers (i.e. providers), in order to successfully reconcile their personal interests. In the meantime, organizations tap into the sphere of private assets and skills, as formal organizations and not as family, friends, or acquaintances, to make profits or reach other objectives.

50|$|Since 1983 the {{percentage}} of people either graduating from high school or failing to complete high school but getting a GED certification has increased from 85% to 88%. The greatest increases in educational attainment were documented in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. In the 1950s and much of the 1960s high school graduates constituted about 50% of those considered adults (25 and above). For young adults aged between 25 and 29, {{the percentage}} of either high school graduates or GED <b>obtainers</b> was roughly 50% in 1950 versus 90% today.|$|R
5000|$|Pure {{collaboration}} involves direct P2P exchanges, {{in which}} consumers directly exchange a specific resource or service. For example, on online platforms such as classified ads or auctions websites, consumers directly provide and obtain resources or services. Although these online platforms are intermediates {{they are not}} [...] "mediators", because consumers are free to devise the terms and conditions of distribution and consumption of the resource or service together, whereas mediators interfere in the devising. In sum, mediators are intermediates but not all intermediates are necessarily mediators. For example, the Canadian-based ridesharing website Amigo Express does not allow <b>obtainers</b> (carpooling <b>obtainers)</b> and providers (carpooling providers) to get into contact to arrange {{the terms of the}} ride. Rather, each agent needs to separately contact and pay a fee to the website in order to, respectively, obtain and provide the service. Amigo Express is therefore an intermediate that is a mediator. Conversely, using TheCarpoolingNetwork enables consumers to arrange themselves the terms and conditions of the exchange and the website acts as a facilitator, not as a mediator. Most C2C websites are online platforms and operate on the freemium model, where the use of the website is free, but premium features must be paid for (e.g. Craigslist). Others have a donationware mode of exchange, whereby website use is free but financial donations are requested or accepted to offset production and maintenance costs (e.g. The Khan Academy).|$|R
5000|$|Collaborative {{consumption}} is challenging to business scholars and practitioners alike because, as a concept, it induces a two-sided consumer role which {{goes beyond the}} classic notion of a buyer/consumer, who typically has no input in the production or distribution process. Companies have traditionally sold products and services to consumers, they now start pulling on their resources too through co-creation or prosumption. According to Scaraboto, this means that individuals are able to [...] "switch roles, engage in embedded entrepreneurship and collaborate to produce and access resources". Collaborative {{consumption is}} characterized by consumers' capacity of being both [...] "providers" [...] and [...] "obtainers" [...] of resources, in a given [...] "resource circulation system". A collaborative consumption systems means therefore a resource circulation {{system in which the}} individual is not only a mere [...] "consumer" [...] but also an <b>obtainer</b> who has the opportunity to endorse, if wanted or needed, a [...] "provider" [...] role (e.g. Kijiji, Craigslist, eBay), as follows: ...|$|E

They claim to challenge conventional business, and they do so, because they operate business differently, without delivering or producing anything by themselves, but by capitalizing on the logics of 'crowdsourcing' to do so. Sourcing collaboration therefore means that organizations do not provide a resource or deliver a service to consumers by themselves, but rely on providers (i.e. consumers) to perform any of both. They benefit from the Internet to mediate, at a cost and more efficiently, exchanges {{that would otherwise be}} authentically C2C exchanges. As an example, sourcing collaboration may refer to refurbished or reconditioned products, sold by conventional organizations, but provided by consumers (i.e. providers) who were, for some reason, dissatisfied with the products in question. Other examples include consumer provision of resources to antique dealers, consignment shops or Amazon's Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) program. Similarly, online platforms which take a percentage off the transaction cost in supposedly C2C exchanges (e.g. Uber, Instacart, Task Rabbit, Airbnb), actually outsource the fulfillment of specific tasks or jobs to consumer A in order to efficiently redistribute those to consumer B. Also, a tangible resource may circulate across multiple organizations (intermediates) from the provider to the <b>obtainer.</b> For example, a car sold by a consumer to a professional car dealer may then be sold and resold by several other car dealers, before being eventually resold to a consumer.

As {{one of the most}} :important factors {{to the success of the}} CO 2 -ECBM process, adsorption of methane and CO 2 on coal helps to assess the amount of recoverable methane as well as the storage capacity of. CO 2 of the targeted coal seam. In this work, the methane and CO 2 adsorption isotherms were measured with a volumetric technique at temperatures of 35, 50, and 65 C and pressures up to 1 : 6 and 12 MPa (CO 2 adsorption at 35 C is limited below 6 MPa), respectively. Four coals of various rank exploited from four main coal seams in China were tested. The isotherms fit well to the Ono-Kondo lattice model, which confirms the applicability of this model in describing the adsorption behaviors of methane and CO 2 on coal under the supercritical conditions. In addition, the experimental results show that the excess adsorption of CO 2 reaches the maximum level between 7 and 9 MPa, while the excess adsorption of methane exhibits a less pronounced maximum. The maximum adsorption capacities of the coals for methane and CO 2 decrease slightly with temperature increase. Additionally, the maximum adsorption capacities of methane and CO 2 are also dependent on coal rank (indicated by vitrinite reflectance coefficient, R-o max) and present a U-shaped trend with coal rank. The preferential adsorption ratio of CO 2 to methane on a basis of absolute adsorption <b>obtainer,</b> from Ono-Kondo lattice model is in the range of 1. 13 - 3. 52 under test conditions. This ratio of bituminous coals (R-o max ranging from 0. 47 % to 1. 35 %) decreases significantly with increasing pressure; however, the pressure dependence of the preferential adsorption ratio is less pronounced for the anthracite (R-o max = 4. 06 %). The preferential adsorption ratio decreases with an increase in coal rink with the only exception of anthracite...|$|E
40|$|To obtain and use {{information}} {{is very important}} for all people in all areas of life. To recieve the best possible information in the easiest possible way, many studies about cathering and searching information have been carried out. The history of those studies goes back in the end of last century. During this time researchers have developed the theoretical approach to information behavior. Common definition to information, need for information and information behaviour is still not found. At first the aim of researches were information channels and systems. Later studies focus more on people, as the creators, <b>obtainers</b> and users of information. The aim {{of this study is to}} give an over view of the need for information, information channels and the pattern of using information among students in Open University of Tartu. To carry out the study, a questionnaire was prepared with the help of Pille Pruulmann- Vengerfeldt from the Institute of Journalism and Communication, who was also the supervisor of my research paper, Mehis Tuisk, from the department of info technology and the questionnaire was coordinated with the Tartu University’s Department of Communication and Study. In parallel to this study a second study was completed. That study was completed by Elen-Greete Jaadla and it focused on the need for information and the patterns of using information channels and sources among full time students in University of Tartu. From the survey, I got an overview of the topics that students think are the most important and informative for them. The largest volume of information included the topics related to teaching, learning and information about regulations of the learning process. Also was important the access of further studies, getting general information about University of Tartu and news. Research results improved that the most informative and effective ways to share and get information is intranet, webpage of Tartu University and lists of information of the subunits. Most students use intranet for getting useful information, they also use different search engines like Google, Neti etc. Media is being used as well - different radio stations, newspapers, journals and TV. Like students all over the world, the students of Tartu University also get and share information in social media like Facebook, Orkut, Twitter etc. The most informative people from the students point of view are the learning management specialists, lectors and other students. These sources are consistent with using frequency. For a large number of students the most effective ones from these sources were the lectors and learning management specialists. Students evaluated the availability of information to be very good, as many as 94 % of respondents claimed that they find all needed information. Most of the students want their information electronically. Based on the survey, a conclusion can be made that students use both University Tartu informational sources and channels as well as sources mediating University Tartu’s information for example social media communications. The questionnaire survey results showed that selected methodology used was suitable for the attaining the objective – as a result I got the overview of Open University students requirements for information and use of informational channels and sources. The questionnaire survey can not however be used for thorough questioning because of the pre set answers that the answerer has to choose between. One has to answer exactly what the questionnaire asks for and there is no possibility to divagating the topic as would be possible with the interview. This itself can be the cause of subjects being cursory while filling the questionnaire except for questions that had optional fill-in field but where the students showed low filling activity. The author in general receives the exact required answers through questionnaire form...|$|R
