Methods A comprehensive <b>orphan</b> drug database was compiled from FDA data and corporate annual reports of major pharmaceutical companies. Analysis allowed the generation of a descriptive <b>orphan</b> drug portrait as well as documentation of <b>orphan</b> drugs along their lifecycle. Results Currently, 2002 products have obtained <b>orphan</b> drug designation with 352 drugs obtaining FDA approval. Approximately 33 % of <b>orphan</b> drugs are oncology products. On average, products obtain 1. 7 <b>orphan</b> designations with approximately 70 % obtaining a single designation. At least 9 % of <b>orphan</b> drugs have reached blockbuster status with two-thirds having two or more designations. An additional 25 <b>orphan</b> drugs had sales exceeding US$ 100 million in 2008 alone. Since 1983, at least 14 previously discontinued products have been recycled as <b>orphan</b> drugs.

40|$|Background: <b>Orphan</b> {{drugs are}} a growing issue of {{importance}} to European healthcare policy makers. The success of <b>orphan</b> drug legislation in Europe has resulted in {{an increasing number of}} licensed medicines for rare diseases, and many more yet unlicensed products have received <b>orphan</b> drug designation. Increasingly the concerns amongst policy makers relate to issues of patient access and affordability, yet few studies have sought to estimate the future budget impact of <b>orphan</b> drugs. The aim {{of this study was to}} predict the total cost of <b>orphan</b> medicines in Europe between 2010 and 2020 as a percentage of total European pharmaceutical expenditure. Methods: A disease-based epidemiological model was created based upon trends in the designation and approval of new <b>orphan</b> medicines, prevalence estimates for <b>orphan</b> diseases, and historical price and sales data for <b>orphan</b> drugs in Europe (defined as Eurozone + UK). The analysis incorporated two stages: 1) Predicting the number of diseases for which new <b>orphan</b> drugs will be approved over the next decade, based on an analysis of trends from the EU registry of <b>orphan</b> medicines; 2) Estimating the average ex-factory drug cost across an <b>orphan</b> disease life cycle, from the year in which the first <b>orphan</b> medicine is launched to the point where the first medicine loses marketing exclusivity.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>Orphan</b> Drug Act (1983) {{established}} several {{incentives to}} encourage the development of <b>orphan</b> drugs (ODs) to treat rare diseases and conditions. This study analyzed the characteristics of OD designations, approvals, sponsors, and evaluated the effective patent and market exclusivity life of <b>orphan</b> new molecular entities (NMEs) approved in the US between 1983 and 2007. Methods Primary data sources were the FDA Orange Book, the FDA Office of <b>Orphan</b> Drugs Development, and the US Patent and Trademark Office. Data included all <b>orphan</b> designations and approvals listed by the FDA and all NMEs approved by the FDA during the study period. Results The FDA listed 1, 793 <b>orphan</b> designations and 322 approvals between 1983 and 2007. Cancer was the main group of diseases targeted for <b>orphan</b> approvals. Eighty-three companies concentrated 67. 7 % of the total <b>orphan</b> NMEs approvals. The average time from <b>orphan</b> designation to FDA approval was 4. 0 ± 3. 3 years (mean ± standard deviation). The average maximum effective patent and market exclusivity life was 11. 7 ± 5. 0 years for <b>orphan</b> NME. OD market exclusivity increased the average maximum effective patent and market exclusivity life of ODs by 0. 8 years. Conclusion Public programs, federal regulations, and policies support <b>orphan</b> drugs R&D. Grants, research design support, FDA fee waivers, tax incentives, and <b>orphan</b> drug market exclusivity are the main incentives for <b>orphan</b> drug R&D. Although the 7 -year <b>orphan</b> drug market exclusivity provision had a positive yet relatively modest overall effect on effective patent and market exclusivity life, economic incentives and public support mechanisms provide a platform for continued <b>orphan</b> drug development for a highly specialized market. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Orphan</b> {{designated}} {{medicinal products}} benefit from regulatory and economic incentives for <b>orphan</b> drug development.

Therefore, <b>orphan</b> designation application files and annual reports submitted by the applicant were reviewed at the premises of the European Medicines Agency. Results: At the time of application, 41. 6 % of products with <b>orphan</b> designation for rare neoplastic disorders were in pre-clinical phase; this was 65. 1 % for other rare conditions (p < 0. 05). Thirty percent of <b>orphan</b> designations for rare neoplastic disorders had reached phase 1; compared to 19. 3 % of <b>orphan</b> designations targeting other rare conditions (p < 0. 05).

40|$|An <b>orphan</b> {{disease is}} a disease with a very low prevalence. Although there are 5000 - 7000 <b>orphan</b> diseases, only 50 <b>orphan</b> drugs (i. e. drugs {{developed}} to treat <b>orphan</b> diseases) were marketed in the EU {{by the end of}} 2008. In 2000, the EU implemented policies specifically designed to stimulate the development of <b>orphan</b> drugs. While decisions on <b>orphan</b> designation and the marketing authorization of <b>orphan</b> drugs are made at the EU level, decisions on drug reimbursement are made at the member state level. The specific features of <b>orphan</b> diseases and <b>orphan</b> drugs make them a high-priority issue for policy makers. The aim {{of this article is to}} identify and discuss several issues surrounding <b>orphan</b> disease and drug policies in Europe. The present system of <b>orphan</b> designation allows for drugs for non-orphan diseases to be designated as <b>orphan</b> drugs. The economic factors underlying <b>orphan</b> designation can be questioned in some cases, as a low prevalence of a certain indication does not equal a low return on investment for the drug across its indications. High-quality evidence about the clinical added value of <b>orphan</b> drugs is rarely available at the time of marketing authorization, due to the low number of patients. A balance must be struck between ethical and economic concerns. To this effect, there is a need to initiate a societal dialogue on this issue, to clarify what society wants and accepts in terms of ethical and economic consequences. The growing budgetary impact of <b>orphan</b> drugs puts pressure on drug expenditure. Indications can be extended for an <b>orphan</b> drug and the total prevalence across indications is not considered. Finally, cooperation needs to be fostered in the EU, particularly through a standardized approach to the creation and use of registries. These issues require further attention from researchers, policy makers, health professionals, patients, pharmaceutical companies and other stakeholders with a view to optimizing <b>orphan</b> disease and drug policies in Europe.

40|$|To review {{existing}} {{regulations and}} policies utilised by countries to enable patient access to <b>orphan</b> drugs. A {{review of the}} literature (1998 to 2014) was performed to identify relevant, peer-reviewed articles. Using content analysis, we synthesised regulations and policies for access to <b>orphan</b> drugs by type and by country. Fifty seven articles and 35 countries were included in this review. Six broad categories of regulation and policy instruments were identified: national <b>orphan</b> drug policies, <b>orphan</b> drug designation, marketing authorization, incentives, marketing exclusivity, and pricing and reimbursement. The availability of <b>orphan</b> drugs depends on individual country's legislation and regulations including national <b>orphan</b> drug policies, <b>orphan</b> drug designation, marketing authorization, marketing exclusivity and incentives such as tax credits to ensure research, development and marketing. The majority of countries (27 / 35) had in place <b>orphan</b> drug legislation. Access to <b>orphan</b> drugs depends on individual country's pricing and reimbursement policies, which varied widely between countries. High prices and insufficient evidence often limit <b>orphan</b> drugs from meeting the traditional health technology assessment criteria, especially cost-effectiveness, which may influence access. Overall many countries have implemented a combination of legislations, regulations and policies for <b>orphan</b> drugs in the last two decades. While these may enable the availability and access to <b>orphan</b> drugs, there are critical differences between countries in terms of range and types of legislations, regulations and policies implemented.

40|$|This project {{carries out}} an {{analysis}} of market access of <b>orphan</b> drugs for rare diseases. In the European Union (EU), <b>orphan</b> drugs are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of rare diseases. These rare diseases are life-threatening or chronically seriously debilitating conditions affecting {{no more than five}} in 10, 000 persons in the EU. Worldwide, policies are available to stimulate the development and marketing of <b>orphan</b> drugs. Such policies serve to compensate industry for the risks and lower potential return on investment due to the low number of patients. Part 1 of this project, the general introduction, provides the definitions and background related to <b>orphan</b> drugs and rare diseases and presents an overview of the different steps of market access of <b>orphan</b> drugs in the EU. The contents of this project reflect these steps, i. e. orphandesignation and marketing authorization are discussed in part 2, pricing is discussed in part 3, reimbursement in part 4 and uptake in part 5. The general introduction also provides an overview of the arguments for and against attributing special status to <b>orphan</b> drugs. Studies on the registration of <b>orphan</b> drugs are reported in part 2. An evaluationof the <b>orphan</b> drug policies in the EU by <b>orphan</b> drug experts is provided in chapter 2. 1. Experts perceive the <b>orphan</b> drug policies in the EU asuseful. Within the context of continuing to optimize patient access to <b>orphan</b> drugs, several policy recommendations were formulated such as defining the concept of sufficiently profitable in the context of reducing the period of market exclusivity for highly profitable <b>orphan</b> drugs, determining the level of clinical evidence needed to authorize <b>orphan</b> drugs, etc. Chapter 2. 2 describes the development and validation of a new tool, COMPASS, to assess the quality of <b>orphan</b> drugs clinical evidence presented for <b>orphan</b> drugs at the time of marketing authorization. The tool was drawn up based on elements derived from existing checklists supplemented with items specifically related to rare diseases and <b>orphan</b> drugs as recommended by six experts. The COMPASS tool can for examplebe used by local reimbursement agencies for the review of clinical evidence in <b>orphan</b> drug registration dossiers or by clinicians and pharmacists upon considering a (new) <b>orphan</b> drug treatment. The COMPASS tool was used in chapter 2. 3 to quantitatively evaluate the characteristicsand quality of pivotal studies presented for <b>orphan</b> drugs authorised inthe EU before July 1 st, 2012. These studies were found to exhibit methodological flaws such as lack of blinding in the study design, lack of QoL-related endpoints as outcome, use of surrogate endpoints, etc. Additionally, there were important shortcomings in the reporting of those studies, which further complicates the interpretation of the clinical evidence. This study shows that a more demanding regulatory process for <b>orphan</b> drugs is needed. Studies on the pricing of <b>orphan</b> drugs are reported in part 3. The influence of <b>orphan</b> designation status on prices of drugs for rare indications is demonstrated in chapter 3. 1. The analysis showed that the median price per defined daily dose was higher for drugs with an <b>orphan</b> designation ( 138. 56) than for drugs without an <b>orphan</b> designation used for rare indications ( 16. 55). Chapter 3. 2 providesseveral examples of repurposed drugs for rare indications for which theeffectiveness evidence was published prior to the application for <b>orphan</b> designation status. Upon comparing Belgian hospital prices per defineddaily dose of selected drugs for common diseases with the price of repurposed drugs for the rare disease indication, differences of up to 200 fold were reported. This pricing practice adds to the budget impact of treating rare diseases. An overview of the international scientificliterature on the drivers of pricing of ultra-orphan drugs in describedin chapter 3. 3. Ultra-rare diseases constitute an informal subcategory,within rare diseases, to describe very rare diseases (i. e. occurring inless than one per 50, 000 individuals). The pricing process of ultra-orphan drugs is a complex and non-transparent issue. Evidence in the literature seems to indicate that ultra-orphan drugs are priced based on rarity of the indication and the number of available alternatives. Chapter 3. 4 shows how various drug- and disease-specific variables relate toannual treatment costs per patient and per <b>orphan</b> drug indication in six EU Member States. Additionally, it was investigated if certain country-specific pricing and reimbursement policies affect the price level of <b>orphan</b> drugs. Repurposed <b>orphan</b> drugs, orally administered <b>orphan</b> drugs or <b>orphan</b> drugs for which an alternative treatment is available are associated with lower annual treatment costs. <b>Orphan</b> drugs with multiple <b>orphan</b> indications, for chronic treatments or for which an improvement in overall survival or quality-of-life has been demonstrated, are associated with higher annual treatment costs. No association was found between annual treatments cost of <b>orphan</b> drugs across countries and the different pricing and reimbursement systems. Current debate about the affordabilityof high-priced <b>orphan</b> drugs highlights the need for more transparency in <b>orphan</b> drug price setting. The topic of reimbursement of <b>orphan</b> drugs is discussed in part 4. Because of their high price and difficulties in demonstrating effectiveness, <b>orphan</b> drugs are often perceived as not able to provide value for money. In chapter 4. 1 an overview of the evidence on the value for money of <b>orphan</b> drugs is given. Results show that <b>orphan</b> drugs can provide value for money. Considering a threshold of £ 30, 000 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) (i. e. threshold for reimbursement applied in England and Wales) ten {{out of a total of}} nineteen <b>orphan</b> drugs for which data was available, offer value for money. Factors other than cost-effectiveness are also taken into account at the time of reimbursement In chapter 4. 2 qualitative research methods were applied to establish that various official (i. e. therapeutic value, budget impact, price and impact in clinical practice) and non-official (i. e. pricing and reimbursement in other countries, interference by patient organisations and experts, arguments related to quality of pharmaceutical compounding, media attention, innovative character, economic importance, ethical arguments and the political climate) factors might influence reimbursement decisions for <b>orphan</b> drugs in Belgium. The identification of these factors is crucial in the development of a transparent and consistent framework which will guide future decision-making for reimbursement of <b>orphan</b> drugs. A study on the uptake of <b>orphan</b> drugs is reported in part 5. Chapter 5. 1 shows that the uptake of <b>orphan</b> drugs varies across EU Member States. The highest volumes of <b>orphan</b> drugs in the first year occurred in Member States with a high gross domestic product (GDP) and implicitly, a higher budget for health care, independently of the existence of a formal health technology assessment (HTA) organisation. In contrast, in countries with a low GDP, <b>orphan</b> drugs were less available incountries with a formal HTA-organisation. There, budgetary restrictionscan cause the exclusion of less cost-effective <b>orphan</b> drugs. These variations have important implications with respect to access to <b>orphan</b> drugs. Recommendations for a sustainable <b>orphan</b> drug market are proposed in the general discussion in part 6. These recommendations relate toone (or more) of the steps of market access. Several recommendations toimprove quality of clinical evidence (for instance by setting trial standards imposing the use of at least one hard endpoint) are formulated. Furthermore, to capture what is valued by patients, patient(s) (organizations) should be able to provide input in an early stage on what endpoints should be considered when developing a new drug for a rare disease. Development of new <b>orphan</b> drugs can be improved by adopting a public-private partnership approach for <b>orphan</b> drug development. Patient registries are an important tool to gather knowledge about the natural course of a rare disease and/or the long-term effectiveness of an <b>orphan</b> drug. Long-term data is required for marketing authorization and to guide reimbursement decisions. Recommendations relating to pricing of <b>orphan</b> drugs include measures to increase transparency in <b>orphan</b> drug pricing, a proposalto prescribe repurposed <b>orphan</b> drugs by international non-proprietary name and a call to revise <b>orphan</b> drug status of sufficiently profitable <b>orphan</b> drugs. Timely access to new <b>orphan</b> drugs can be achieved by implementing managed entry agreements to deal with the uncertainty about cost-effectiveness and by optimizing reimbursement procedures for <b>orphan</b> drugs across EU Member States. Finally, there is a need to define prioritiesin funding and reimbursement of <b>orphan</b> drugs. Upcoming challenges for the <b>orphan</b> drug pharmaceutical industry are also discussed. For instance,adaptive licensing is expected to reduce the overall cost of development and to have a positive effect on timely access to new drugs. Future research could focus on pricing and budget impact <b>orphan</b> drugs, an issue of continued importance in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis. status: publishe...|$|R
