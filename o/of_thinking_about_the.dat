5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> church and its personnel, derived not only from {{contemporary}} continental movements {{but also from the}} rich pastoral and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres, the distinction between monks and clergy, and enhanced the authority of bishops as both pastoral and political leaders. Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry.|$|E

500|$|Weber's main {{intellectual}} {{concern was}} understanding {{the processes of}} rationalisation, secularisation, and [...] "disenchantment" [...] that he associated {{with the rise of}} capitalism and modernity, and which he saw {{as the result of a}} new way <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world. Weber is best known for his thesis combining economic sociology and the sociology of religion, elaborated in his book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, in which he proposed that ascetic Protestantism was one of the major [...] "elective affinities" [...] associated with the rise in the Western world of market-driven capitalism and the rational-legal nation-state. He argued that it was in the basic tenets of Protestantism to boost capitalism. Thus, it can be said that the spirit of capitalism is inherent to Protestant religious values.|$|E
500|$|To most philosophers, {{the word}} [...] "consciousness" [...] connotes the {{relationship}} between the mind and the world. To writers on spiritual or religious topics, it frequently connotes {{the relationship between}} the mind and God, or {{the relationship between the}} mind and deeper truths that are thought to be more fundamental than the physical world. [...] Krishna consciousness, for example, is a term used to mean an intimate linkage between the mind of a worshipper and the god Krishna. [...] The mystical psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke distinguished between three types of consciousness: [...] Simple Consciousness, awareness of the body, possessed by many animals; Self Consciousness, awareness of being aware, possessed only by humans; and Cosmic Consciousness, awareness of the life and order of the universe, possessed only by humans who are enlightened. [...] Many more examples could be given, such as the various levels of spiritual consciousness presented by Prem Saran Satsangi and Stuart Hameroff. The most thorough account of the spiritual approach may be Ken Wilber's book The Spectrum of Consciousness, a comparison of western and eastern ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mind. Wilber described consciousness as a spectrum with ordinary awareness at one end, and more profound types of awareness at higher levels.|$|E

Writing for the Daily Mail, George Stark commented that perhaps the clip [...] "might enjoy a new lease of life". According to Sam Lansky for Idolator, the video's message is a [...] "soulful, and completely inexplicable, letter to her fans thanking them for their undying love". Malene Arpe for the Toronto Star was positive toward the clip, calling it a [...] "perfect antidote to a week <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Miley Cyrus/Robin Thicke porn circus". She continued, [...] "Aguilera's new video is so sweet and innocent and full of goodwill towards humanity, {{it will make you}} forget all about twerking and foam fingers and the inherent greasiness of Robin Thicke".

500|$|In Erlewine's opinion, Marquee Moon was {{radical and}} {{groundbreaking}} primarily as [...] "a guitar rock album unlike any other". Verlaine and Lloyd's dual {{playing on the}} record strongly influenced alternative rock {{groups such as the}} Pixies, noise rock acts such as Sonic Youth, and big arena bands like U2. Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune wrote that Television [...] "created a new template for guitar rock" [...] because of how Verlaine's improvised playing was weaved together with Lloyd's precisely notated solos, particularly on the title track. As a member of U2, Irish guitarist The Edge simulated Television's guitar sound with an effects pedal. He later said he had wanted to [...] "sound like them" [...] and that Marquee Moons title track had changed his [...] "way <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> guitar". Verlaine's jagged, expressive sound on the album made a great impression on American guitarist John Frusciante when he started developing as a guitarist in his early 20s, as it reminded him that [...] "none of those things that are happening in the physical dimension mean anything, whether it's what kind of guitar you play or how your amp's set up. It's just ideas, you know, emotion." [...] In Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield called Marquee Moon [...] "one of the all-time classic guitar albums" [...] whose tremulous guitar twang was an inspiration behind bands such as R.E.M. and Joy Division. Joy Division's Stephen Morris cited it as one of his favorite albums, while R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe said his love of Marquee Moon was [...] "second only to [...] Horses". English guitarist Will Sergeant said it was also one of his favorite records and that Verlaine and Lloyd's guitar playing was a major influence on his band Echo & the Bunnymen.|$|E

The band members aimed to streamline their songwriting processes by only doing what things were necessary in whatever parts without embellishing with long songs.

2500|$|When {{psychiatrists and}} pediatricians {{first began to}} {{recognize}} and discuss childhood psychiatric disorders in the 19th century, they were largely influenced by literary works of the Victorian era. Authors like the Brontë sisters, [...] George Eliot, and Charles Dickens, introduced new ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> child mind and the potential influence early childhood experiences could have on child development and the subsequent adult mind. When the Journal of Psychological Medicine and Mental Pathology, the first psychiatric journal in English, was published in 1848, child psychiatry didn’t exist as its own field yet. However, {{some of the earliest}} works on the possibility of nervous disorders and [...] "insanity" [...] in children were published in the Journal and several medical writers directly referenced works such as Jane Eyre (1847), Wuthering Heights (1847), Dombey and Son (1848), and David Copperfield (1850), to illustrate this new conceptualization of the child mind. Until that time, it was generally accepted that children were free from nervous disorders and the [...] "passions" [...] that affected the adult mind.|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} structural {{device is}} {{the series of}} nine meetings (gams) between the Pequod and other ships. These meetings are important in three ways. First, their placement in the narrative. The initial two meetings and the last two are both close to each other. The central group of five gams are separated by about 12 chapters, more or less. This pattern provides a structural element, remarks Bezanson, as if the encounters were [...] "bones to the book's flesh". Second, Ahab's developing responses to the meetings plot the [...] "rising curve of his passion" [...] and of his monomania. Third, in contrast to Ahab, Ishmael interprets the significance of each ship individually: [...] "each ship is a scroll which the narrator unrolls and reads." [...] Bezanson sees no single way {{to account for the}} meaning of all of these ships. Instead, they may be interpreted as [...] "a group of metaphysical parables, a series of biblical analogues, a masque of the situation confronting man, a pageant of the humors within men, a parade of the nations, and so forth,'as well as concrete and symbolic ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> White Whale".|$|E
