John and Mary both {{live on the}} Axiom and are so {{dependent}} on their personal video screens and automatic services that they are <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> their surroundings, for instance not noticing that the ship features a giant swimming pool. However, they are brought out of their trances after separate encounters with WALL-E, eventually meeting face-to-face for the first time.|$|E

She has a great passion and interest for architecture and she wishes to be an architect when she is older. Although she has a growing love interest in Percy, her feelings for Luke remain a problem between the two.

We give a simple reduction from 1 -out-of- 2 <b>Oblivious</b> Transfer <b>to</b> Private Information Retrieval, where the reduction is against malicious players. We also {{consider the}} completeness of Private Information Retrieval on weakened assumption. We will give a impossibility result and a possibility result. For impossibility result, we use the technique originating in [24]. For possibility result, we reduce Weak Oblivious Transfer which was proposed in [16] to Weak Private Information Retrieval...|$|R

5|$|Bob Napolitano, Wilson's {{coach at}} Londonderry High School, noticed Wilson's ability to {{concentrate}} on baseball. Napolitano specifically remembered the first home game of Wilson's senior year, which happened shortly after his father's death. No fewer than 29 professional scouts, all with radar guns, showed up to see him pitch. According to Napolitano, Wilson was completely <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> their appearance; he ate and drank in the dugout, warmed up, and pitched a two-hitter while apparently not noticing that scouts were there. The Cleveland Indians offered him a contract straight out of high school, {{but he did not}} sign, opting to attend college instead.|$|E
5|$|Fragment of a Crucifixion is a 1950 canvas by the Irish-born, English figurative painter Francis Bacon, {{housed in}} the Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven. The {{painting}} shows two animals engaged in brutal struggle. The upper figure, which may be a dog or a cat, crouches over a chimera and is {{at the point of}} kill. It stoops on the horizontal beam of a T-shaped structure, which may signify Christ's cross. The painting contains thinly sketched passer-by figures, who seem <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> the central drama.|$|E

50|$|Further {{work has}} {{revealed}} <b>oblivious</b> transfer <b>to</b> be a fundamental and important problem in cryptography. It {{is considered one}} of the critical problems in the field, because of the importance of the applications that can be built based on it. In particular, it is complete for secure multiparty computation: that is, given an implementation of oblivious transfer it is possible to securely evaluate any polynomial time computable function without any additional primitive.|$|R
5|$|The cyclist seen {{passing in}} the middle of a sword fight during the tuk tuk chase {{sequence}} was in fact a bystander who passed through the shot, <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> the filming; his intrusion was captured by two cameras and left in the final film. Cameraman Alan Hume's last scene was that of Octopussy's followers rowing. That day, little time was left and it was decided to film the sunset at the eleventh hour.|$|E
5|$|The scheme did {{not meet}} with {{universal}} enthusiasm, and from the beginning, there were some who doubted the true intentions of the promoters. Although many of the sinuous curves and deviations were due to having to maintain a 1 in 50 gradient {{where there was no}} leeway (most observers being <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> the fact that a straighter shorter line would have made the gradient even steeper), several were due to resistance by local landowners along the route.|$|E

In the Pritchett family storyline, Gloria (Sofía Vergara) experiences hearing difficulty following the plane ride while a cowboy, Hank (Tim Blake Nelson), flirts with her.

He said {{if it were not for}} him being the bad guy Jay would not have been a hero, but Gloria fights back and says Jay is always a hero.|$|E

He was subsequently cautioned, but some commentators felt that he seemed <b>oblivious</b> as <b>to</b> what he had done wrong.|$|R

5|$|When a {{defensive}} player has {{the ball and}} can end the play by preventing further advance, but fails to do so because of a mental mistake (not an error) and a runner subsequently scores, the official scorer must decide whether to credit the batter with a run batted in (RBI). If the runner recognized the mistake after slowing or pausing his advance, an RBI is not credited. If the runner was <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> the mistake or runs home without slowing, the batter is credited with an RBI.|$|E

With Harley's help, Stark traces the Mandarin to Miami and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually an English actor named Trevor Slattery, who says he is <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> the actions carried out in his image. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin, using Slattery as a cover. After capturing Stark, Killian shows him Potts (whom he had kidnapped) being subjected to Extremis, {{in order to gain}} Stark's aid to fix Extremis's flaws and thus save Potts. Killian kills Hansen when she has a change of heart and tries to stop him.|$|E

Andy, still <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> the reasons behind April's jealousy, delivers coffee to April, as well as the day's newspaper, containing a story which credits April for providing moral support to Andy.

From Onjong, the ROK 7th Infantry Regiment of the ROK 6th Infantry Division turned north and advanced towards Kojang, while the ROK 2nd Infantry Regiment of the ROK 6th Infantry Division planned to advance northwest from Onjong towards Pukchin. Because the UN Command expected no opposition from the destroyed KPA, the advances were not coordinated between the UN units. As a result, the ROK 7th Infantry Regiment managed to wander into Chinese territory without much opposition, completely <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> the new threats surrounding them.|$|E
5|$|Sarah was {{completely}} <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> any friendship between Anne and Abigail, {{and was therefore}} surprised when she discovered that Abigail frequently saw the Queen in private. Sarah found out about Abigail's marriage several months after it had occurred, and immediately went to see Anne – {{with the intention of}} informing her of the event. It was at this interview that Anne let slip that she had begged Abigail to tell Sarah of the marriage; Sarah became suspicious about what had really happened. After questioning servants and Royal Household for a week about Abigail's marriage, Sarah discovered that Anne had been present and had given Abigail a dowry of £2000 from the Privy Purse. This proved Anne's duplicity to Sarah: as Keeper of the Privy Purse, Sarah had been unaware of any such payment.|$|E

Tenma struggles to confess her feelings to Karasuma. He remains <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> her interest, instead seeking fulfillment by indulging in curry.

5|$|The {{meeting at}} Aintree had been beset by {{problems}} before the race. Fifteen animal rights protesters invaded the course near the first fence (as had also {{happened at the}} 1991 Grand National) resulting in a delayed start. A first false start was caused by several riders becoming tangled in the starting tape. Starter Keith Brown, who was officiating his last National before retirement, waved his red recall flag and a second official, Ken Evans, who was situated 100 yards further down the track, in turn signalled to the leading runners to turn around. At the second attempt, the tape became tangled again — {{around the neck of}} jockey Richard Dunwoody — and Brown called another false start. However, this time his recall flag did not unfurl as he waved it. As a result, 30 of the 39 riders set off around the track, <b>oblivious</b> <b>to</b> the recall.|$|E
