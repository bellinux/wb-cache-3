40|$|Some simple {{structural}} modifications {{have been}} demonstrated {{to be effective in}} reducing aerodynamic drag on vehicles that have empty <b>open</b> <b>cargo</b> bays. The basic idea is to break up the airflow in a large <b>open</b> <b>cargo</b> bay by inserting panels to divide the bay into a series of smaller bays. In the case of a coal car, this involves inserting a small number (typically between two and four) of vertical full-depth or partial-depth panels...|$|R

40|$|CHDS State/LocalA {{substantial}} {{challenge to}} reducing security {{gaps in the}} international air cargo supply chain {{is the lack of}} a method of evaluating existing levels of risk based upon points of origin, points of departure and cargo and aircraft type. This is particularly challenging since the current United States air cargo security protocol requires the 100 percent screening of all air cargo without objectively analyzing or evaluating the risk posed by the air cargo. This thesis proposes a risk-based intelligence driven approach to identify and mitigate the threat of the successful introduction of an improvised explosive device into the international air cargo supply chain. The primary thrust of this research effort is to conduct a comparative analysis of the United States international air <b>cargo</b> <b>policies</b> and the European Unions international air <b>cargo</b> <b>policies</b> as a means of evaluating and proposing a risk based intelligence driven international air <b>cargo</b> <b>policy</b> that capitalizes on the strengths of United States and European Unions systems.

The pilots were struggling to return to the airport. Subsequent poor CRM contributed to the crash.|$|R
5000|$|The tongkang was an unmotorised <b>open</b> <b>cargo</b> boat, {{propelled}} {{by a variety}} of methods, including rowing, punt poles and sail. [...] The early tongkangs were about 20 ton burthen or less; they were {{propelled by}} about ten rowers and guided by a steersman. Long punt poles were used to propel them in shallower water.

The smallest of these, the tracteur de 2 tonnes with the factory designation Renault YI, largely used the AMR 33 suspension, though the sprocket was not spoked but consisted of a single convex plate. The vehicle had an <b>open</b> <b>cargo</b> room behind, the engine in front and the cabin in between. The French Ministry of War ordered two vehicles of each type.|$|R

Approximately 20, 000 items are tracked with the Inventory Management System (IMS) software application that requires both flight and ground crews to update the database daily. This audit process is manually intensive and laborious, requiring the crew to <b>open</b> <b>cargo</b> transfer bags (CTBs), then Ziplock bags therein, to retrieve individual items. This inventory process contributes greatly to the time allocated for general crew tasks...|$|R
50|$|A {{pickup truck}} {{is a light}} duty truck having an {{enclosed}} cab and an <b>open</b> <b>cargo</b> area with low sides and tailgate.

Today in North America, the pickup is mostly used like a passenger car and accounts for about 18 per cent of total vehicles sold in the US.|$|R

50|$|The Estate Wagons also {{featured}} a new 'clamshell' tailgate design, marketed as the Glide-away Tailgate, where the rear power-operated glass slid {{up into the}} roof as the lower tailgate (manually or with power assist), slid into a recess under the cargo floor. Ultimately, the manual lower tailgate was supplanted by the power tailgate. The tailgate system was operated by switches on the instrument panel or a key switch on the rear quarter panel. Like a top-hinged tailgate, the clamshell design allowed a user to stand directly at the <b>open</b> <b>cargo</b> area without impediment, facilitating loading and unloading in tight spaces.|$|R
