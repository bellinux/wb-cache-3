5|$|In 1527 King Henry VIII asked Pope Clement VII to annul his {{marriage}} to Katherine of Aragon, but the pope refused. This started {{a series of events}} known as English Reformation in which Henry broke away from the authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope.</b> In lieu <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope,</b> Henry assumed authority over the church: all priests and religious figures, including monks, were required to swear support to the royal supremacy over the church. Abbot Bourchier and the 25 canons at Leicester Abbey acknowledged the king's royal supremacy on 11 August 1534, thereby saving the abbey from immediate dissolution.|$|E
5|$|A Canonical Coronation (Latin: Coronatam Canonicus): is a pious {{institutional}} act <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope,</b> {{on behalf}} of a devotion. This tradition still stands in 2015, in 2014 Pope Francis crowned Our Lady of Immaculate Conception of Juquila. Since 1989, the act has been carried out through the authorised decree by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, John Paul II promulgated a new Apostolic Constitution, called Universi Dominici gregis, which with {{a slight}} {{modification}} by Pope Benedict XVI now governs the election <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope,</b> abolishing all previous constitutions on the matter, but preserving many procedures that date to much earlier times.|$|E

5|$|In a 1987 sermon Lefebvre, at age 81, {{experiencing}} failing health, {{announced his}} intention to consecrate a bishop to carry on his work after his death.

5|$|The Catholic Church in Afghanistan {{is part of}} the {{worldwide}} Latin Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope</b> in Rome.

5|$|Until 1692 (and {{sometimes}} thereafter), the cardinal-nephew (or a lay nephew) {{would be}} the chief archivist <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope,</b> usually removing the archives to a family archive upon {{the death of the}} pontiff. In particular, the archival collections of the Barberini, Farnese, Chigi, and Borghese families contain important papal documents.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} other {{disagreements}} existed, such as the papal income tax and the refusal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> to create John Morton, the archbishop of Canterbury, a cardinal; Innocent VII had passed over Morton in his first consistory, despite creating two French cardinals. Nor had John Sherwood, the English ambassador in Rome, been created a cardinal in 1484, despite the request of King Richard III. Piccolomini's creation as cardinal protector was requested by Henry VII in a letter congratulating the newly elected Pope Alexander VI, and was confirmed in a response which was probably written by Giovanni Gigli.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope.</b>|$|E

He wanted to replace Sigismund with Stephen with the assistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope,</b> England and Poland, but they received no support. Pope Clement VIII invited him to Rome, but he refused. At the pope's request, Sigismund Báthory allowed Andrew's mother and Stephen's wife, along with their children, to move to Poland. Zamoyski, who strongly opposed Sigismund Báthory's anti-Ottoman policy, supported Andrew and Stephen.|$|E
5|$|As {{bishop of}} Turin, Claudius {{found that men}} were often {{directed}} to go on pilgrimage to Rome for penance and that worshippers were accustomed to venerate Christ and the saints by bowing before images and relics.

He made attacks {{on the use of}} images, relics, and crosses, he opposed pilgrimages to obtain absolution, and he had little regard for the authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> due to his belief that all bishops were equal.|$|E

5|$|In 1780, in {{his first}} {{discussion}} of purely religious matters, Espejo wrote a theological letter, Carta al Padre la Graña sobre indulgencias (Letter to Father la Graña about indulgences). In this work, he looked at indulgences in the Catholic Church. The letter showed a profound knowledge of theology and dogma. It analyzed the historical beginnings of indulgences and their development and cited decrees and bulls written about abuses of indulgences. In this work, Espejo staunchly supported the authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope.</b>|$|E
5|$|In that time, the Christian {{faith was}} {{shaken by the}} {{contrast}} between Miaphysites and Chalcedonians. These were two opposing christological positions; the Chalcedonians claimed that Christ had both human and divine natures, while the Miaphysites claimed he had only one single united nature. The Council of Chalcedon, convoked by Emperor Marcian in 451, had ruled out Miaphysitism, with the support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> in the West and many bishops in the East. However, the Miaphysite position was still strong: the two Miaphysite Patriarchs Timothy Aelurus of Alexandria and Peter the Fuller of Antioch were deposed.|$|E

5|$|Michelangelo, {{who was not}} {{primarily}} a painter but a sculptor, was reluctant {{to take on the}} work. Also, he was occupied with a very large sculptural commission for the pope's own tomb. The pope was adamant, leaving Michelangelo no choice but to accept. But a war with the French broke out, diverting the attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope,</b> and Michelangelo fled from Rome to continue sculpting. The tomb sculptures, however, were never to be finished because in 1508 the pope returned to Rome victorious and summoned Michelangelo to begin work on the ceiling. The contract was signed on 10 May 1508.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{was summoned}} in 1559 to {{consider}} the Reformation Bill {{and to create a}} new church. The Reformation Bill defined the Communion as a consubstantial celebration as opposed to a transubstantial celebration, included abuse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pope</b> in the litany, and ordered that ministers should not wear the surplice or other Roman Catholic vestments. It allowed ministers to marry, banned images from churches, and confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England.|$|E

The panel contains subtle indications of the contradictions in the character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pope,</b> and captures the complex psychological dynamic between the three men.|$|E
