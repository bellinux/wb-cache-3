If a majority votes for the amendment, the amendment is passed on the thirtieth day after the vote.|$|E
5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development <b>or</b> <b>general</b> delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E
5|$|Away {{from the}} wall, Roman sculptures include the marble {{head of a}} Roman emperor <b>or</b> <b>general,</b> broken from a larger statue, which was found at Hawkshaw, Peebleshire {{in the late eighteenth}} century. It dates to the second century CE and may have been looted from a Roman {{monument}} further to the south. The Cramond Lioness is a sculpture, probably imported, of a lioness devouring a bound prisoner, found near the Roman base of Cramond Roman Fort near Edinburgh. A relief of the goddess Brigantia found near Birrens in Dumfriesshire, combines elements of native and classical art.|$|E

50|$|The {{decision}} {{to appoint a}} special prosecutor is made by the executive branch, historically by the president <b>or</b> attorney <b>general</b> (<b>or</b> acting attorney <b>general).</b> The only exception to this was the Teapot Dome special prosecutors, whose appointment was mandated by a joint resolution of Congress.|$|R
5|$|Capybaras are gregarious. While they {{sometimes}} live solitarily, {{they are more}} commonly found in groups of around 10â€“20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles. Capybara groups can consist {{of as many as}} 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season when the animals gather around available water sources. Males establish social bonds, dominance, <b>or</b> <b>general</b> group consensus. They can make dog-like barks when threatened or when females are herding young.|$|E

In the general election Wolf defeated Republican real estate developer James H. Crocker Jr. In his 2012 bid for re-election Wolf faced no competition in either a primary <b>or</b> <b>general</b> election. In 2014 Wolf was re-elected to his third term, defeating Republican Ron Beaty in the general election.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the armed conflict, there are other explanations for this situation: Municipalities tend to use their financial resources from the Sistema General de Participaciones <b>or</b> <b>General</b> Participation System (Law 715 of 2001) mainly in urban areas. Furthermore, there is no institution or program {{at the national level}} which offers technical assistance to the 12,000 rural community organizations. Law 142 of 1994 assigns that task to the departments, but these have not carried out the task in a satisfactory way so far.|$|E

5|$|Nonprofit {{organizations}} {{and government agencies}} have special requirements to show, in financial statements and reports, how money is spent, rather than how much profit was earned. Unlike profit oriented businesses, which use a single set of self-balancing accounts (<b>or</b> <b>general</b> ledger), nonprofits can {{have more than one}} general ledger (or fund), depending on their financial reporting requirements. An accountant for such an entity must be able to produce reports detailing the expenditures and revenues for each of the organization's individual funds, and reports that summarize the organization's financial activities across all of its funds.|$|E

5|$|Organ stops can be {{combined}} in countless permutations, resulting in {{a great variety of}} sounds. A combination action can be used to switch instantly from one combination of stops (called a registration) to another. Combination actions feature small buttons called pistons that can be pressed by the organist, generally located beneath the keys of each manual (thumb pistons) or above the pedalboard (toe pistons). The pistons may be divisional (affecting only a single division) <b>or</b> <b>general</b> (affecting all the divisions), and are either preset by the organ builder or can be altered by the organist. Modern combination actions operate via computer memory, and can store several channels of registrations.|$|E

5|$|The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) was {{introduced}} in 1995 in the Human Development Report written by the United Nations Development Program in order to add a gender-sensitive dimension to the Human Development Index. The GDI takes into account not only the average <b>or</b> <b>general</b> level of well-being and wealth within a given country, but also how this wealth and well-being is distributed between different groups within society, especially between genders. However, feminist economists do not universally agree {{on the use of}} the GDI and some offer improvements to it.|$|E

5|$|The known {{material}} {{includes two}} cervical vertebrae, nine dorsal vertebrae, a few ribs, {{a fragment of}} a pubis, and many gastroliths. Of the material, only the vertebrae are diagnostic, with the ribs and pubis being too fragmentary <b>or</b> <b>general</b> to distinguish Dinheirosaurus. This material was first described as in the genus Lourinhasaurus, but differences were noticed and in 1999 Bonaparte and Mateus redescribed the material under the new binomial Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis. Another specimen, ML 418, thought to be Dinheirosaurus, is now known to be from another Portuguese diplodocid. This means that Dinheirosaurus lived alongside many theropods, sauropods, thyreophorans and ornithopods, {{as well as at}} least one other diplodocid.|$|E

Sitz (1990), the Supreme Court allowed discretionless sobriety checkpoints. In Illinois v. Lidster (2004), the Supreme Court allowed focused informational checkpoints.
