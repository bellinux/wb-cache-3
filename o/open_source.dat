The amount of <b>open</b> <b>sources</b> information an individual has access to has increased dramatically in the 21 st century.

In this study, an <b>open</b> <b>sources</b> intelligence (OSINT) integrated intelligence model is proposed, explained and compared with the traditional intelligence model.
