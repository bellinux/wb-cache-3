25|$|The archaeological {{evidence}} now in 2016/2017 firmly favours a Shebitku-Shabaka succession. Gerard Broekman's GM 251 (2017) paper shows that Shebitku reigned before Shabaka since the upper edge of Shabaka’s NLR #30’s Year 2 Karnak quay inscription was carved over the left-hand {{side of the}} lower edge of Shebitku’s NLR#33 Year 3 inscription. This can <b>only</b> <b>mean</b> that Shabaka ruled after Shebitku.|$|E
25|$|In June 1459 a Great Council {{was summoned}} to meet at Coventry. York, the Nevilles and some other lords refused to appear, fearing that the armed forces that had been {{commanded}} to assemble the previous month had been summoned to arrest them. Instead, York and Salisbury recruited in their strongholds and met Warwick, who had brought with him his troops from Calais, at Worcester. Parliament {{was summoned to}} meet at Coventry in November, but without York and the Nevilles. This could <b>only</b> <b>mean</b> {{that they were to}} be accused of treason.|$|E
25|$|Until recent times, Shebitku {{was placed}} within the 25th Dynasty between Shabaka and Taharqa. Although the {{possibility}} of a switch between the reigns of Shabaka and Shebitku had already been suggested before by Brunet and Baker had outlined nine reasons for the reversal, it was Michael Bányai in 2013 who first published in a mainstream journal many arguments in favor of such a relocation. After him, Frédéric Payraudeau and Gerard P. F. Broekman independently expanded the hypothesis. The archaeological evidence now in 2016/2017 firmly favours a Shebitku-Shabaka succession. Gerard Broekman's GM 251 (2017) paper shows that Shebitku reigned before Shabaka since the upper edge of Shabaka’s NLR #30 Year 2 Karnak quay inscription was carved over the left-hand side of the lower edge of Shebitku's NLR#33 Year 3 inscription.

25|$|On 1 November 2011 TEPCO {{said that}} xenon-133 and xenon-135 were {{detected}} in gas-samples {{taken from the}} containment vessel of reactor 2, in a concentration of 6 to 10 (or more) parts per million becquerels per cubic centimeter. Xenon-135 was also detected in gas samples collected on 2 November. These isotopes {{are the result of}} nuclear fission-reaction of uranium. Because the short half-lifes of these gases: (Xe-133: 5 days Xe-135: 9 hours), the presence could <b>only</b> <b>mean</b> that nuclear fissions were occurring at some places in the reactor. Boric-acid was poured into the reactor in an attempt to stop the fission-reactions. No significant change in temperature or pressure was found by TEPCO, so {{there was no sign of}} large-scale criticality. The reactor-cooling was continued, but TEPCO would examine the situation at reactor 1 and 3 also. Professor Koji Okamoto of the University of Tokyo Graduate School made the comment that localized and temporary fission might still happen, and that the melted fuel could undergo fission, but the fuel was probably scattered around. Neutrons from radioactive materials could react with the uranium fuel and other substances. Self-sustaining chain reactions were unlikely, thanks to the huge amounts of boric acid that were poured into the reactor.|$|E
25|$|Mirroring the {{historical}} political {{conflicts between the}} freethought and Catholic segments of the population, the Flemish educational system is split into a secular branch controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, and a subsidised religious—mostly Catholic—branch. For the subsidised schools, the main costs such as the teacher's wages and building maintenance completely borne by the Flemish government. Subsidised schools are also free to determine their own teaching and examination methods, but in exchange, they {{must be able to}} prove that certain minimal terms are achieved by keeping records of the given lessons and exams. It should however be noted that—at least for the Catholic schools—the religious authorities have very limited power over these schools, neither do the schools have a lot of power on their own. Instead, the Catholic schools are a member of the Catholic umbrella organisation VSKO. The VSKO determines most practicalities for schools, like the advised schedules per study field. However, there's freedom of education in Flanders, which doesn't <b>only</b> <b>mean</b> that every pupil can choose his/her preferred school, but also that every organisation can found a school, and even be subsidised when abiding the different rules. This resulted also in some smaller school systems follow 'methodical pedagogies' (e.g. Steiner, Montessori, or Freinet) or serve the Jewish and Protestant minorities.|$|E

He then cited eight instances of the Government's alleged non-compliance with the rule of law, including detention without trial under, inter alia, the ISA and the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act ("CLTPA"); denial of the right of arrested persons to counsel and to visits from their families for a period of time; denial of the rights to freedom of speech and assembly; and the tendency of the executive not to provide reasons for decisions made.

[...] She also wrote that given who their parents are, [...] "that can <b>only</b> <b>mean</b> trouble". Fenmore has dated Summer, to which Ehrich stated: [...] "Everything he does is for his love for Summer. He has this obsession with her. Every action he does stems from that." [...] In another interview, he stated of their relationship: [...] "I think Fen’s first love is Summer; he falls in love; he’s infatuated with her. She plays games with him, and where it’s going is – will Fen get into her ways, or will he stand his ground? Everything Fenmore does is coming from his love for Summer, so he’s still the same kid, it’s just sometimes love makes you do some crazy thing Fenmore later began to enter a rebellious phase." [...] Tracey Bregman (who portrays his mother Lauren) stated that she [...] "was always hoping they would show the dark side of our child, because both Lauren and Michael have dark sides. That is something they both work hard on to suppress, that comes out now and them." [...] Christian LeBlanc (who portrays his father Michael) stated Michael has [...] "troubled youth to deal with", saying: [...] "It’s the first time on Y that such a young storyline has pulled such focus.

[...] The character was later involved in a cyberbullying storyline with Summer and Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo). Michael Logan of TV Guide previewed the storyline, writing: [...] "Adding fuel to the fire is young Fen Baldwin (Max Ehrich), who is so infatuated with Summer that he becomes her partner in crime — in fact, he takes things a few dangerous steps further once he sees Summer's growing fondness for Jamie." [...] Ehrich liked the plot as he was bullied as a child, stating: [...] "Kids do it out of their own sadness or insecurity, but needless to say that doesn’t matter when you’re a victim of it - you feel so isolated and so alone. To have a storyline that addresses it, it’s like, [...] "This is real; this is what happens". People need to know the truth {{of what is going on}} out there." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{result is}} a syllabary of 2082 syllables, about 80% of which are single morphemes—that is, in 80% of cases there is no {{difference}} between GC and standard written Chinese, and in running text, that figure rises to 90–95%, as the most common morphemes tend to be uniquely identified. For example, kai can <b>only</b> <b>mean</b> 開 kāi 'open', and sam can <b>only</b> <b>mean</b> 三 sān 'three'. Chao notes, [...] "These syllables then are morphemes, or words with definite meanings, or clusters of meanings related by extensions. About 20 percent of the syllables are homophones under each of which there will be more than one morpheme, [...] usually written with different characters [...] The degree of homophony is so low that {{it will be possible to}} write text either in literary or colloquial Chinese with the same character for each syllable [...] as has been tested in texts of various styles." [...] Chao compares General Chinese to how Chinese was written when the writing system was still productive: [...] "This amounts to a 100 percent use of writing Chinese by 'phonetic loan' [...] The situation is that when the ancients wrote a character by sound regardless of meaning, it was a 'loan character', whereas if a modern schoolboy writes one, he is punished for writing the wrong character!" ...|$|E
