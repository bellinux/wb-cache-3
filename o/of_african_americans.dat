40|$|Scholars <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> {{religion}} {{have done}} well to note the poignant role of cultural productions in the making, doing, and theorizing of religion and life options. Lacking in this discourse is critical attention to the religious significance <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> quilts, the quilters who make them, and the quilt-making process as source material for the study <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> religion. This dissertation adopts and thinks {{with the work of}} Anthony B. Pinn’s definition <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> religion as the quest for complex subjectivity, a desire or feeling for life meaning. Through a multi-disciplinary approach that draws on religious studies, sociology and art criticism/art history, the dissertation asserts that some <b>African</b> <b>American</b> quilters use scraps of mundane materials to craft visual testimonies that link the quest for complexity to everyday life. Research from the analyses allows scholars to gain deeper insight into the role <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> quilts in the expression of religion, and consider the cultural production of quilts as legitimate and viable source material for the study <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> religious life. Quilting Faith: <b>African</b> <b>American</b> Quilts as Source Material for the Study <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> Religion reveals that <b>African</b> <b>American</b> quilts are just as important to understanding <b>African</b> <b>American</b> religion as music, drama, dance, poetry, and slave narratives...|$|R

5|$|In this period, {{while the}} Great Migration <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> {{out of the}} South to the North was beginning, blacks in the two regions dealt with {{different}} conditions. The {{vast majority of the}} millions <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> still lived in the South, many in rural areas where they were the majority population. But they were effectively disfranchised by new electoral rules and state constitutions, utterly closed out of the political process. This situation would continue, despite some temporarily effective court challenges, through the 1960s. Washington believed he had to help this population within the constraints of their environment. At the same time, he secretly funded legal challenges against the voter registration and electoral restrictions. Trotter and other radicals tended to come from the North, where African Americans exercised more rights in daily life, including the suffrage, were more urbanized, and had achieved more in work and education, but were still subject to discrimination.|$|E

40|$|<b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> have an {{interest}} in their cultural and ethnic heritage. One method of gaining information about <b>African</b> <b>American</b> heritage is by examining historical images <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> women in relation to appearance. Unfortunately sources pertaining to <b>African</b> <b>American</b> appearance are limited. The purpose of this research was to use descriptions of appearance (dress and the body) in slave narratives, define themes relative to appearance, and assess aspects <b>of</b> appearance <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> persons during the period of slavery in North America. Content analysis and Bathes 2 ̆ 7 system for analyzing written garments were used to collect data from the references to appearance (dress and the body) in the slave narratives written by <b>African</b> <b>American</b> women. A purposive sample of ten slave narratives was subjected to both methods of data collection. Findings included the identification of binary themes that provided meanings <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> slave dress in the narratives. These included poverty/wealth, utilities/luxuries, purity/impurity, sadness/cheerfulness, conspicuous/inconspicuous, and comfortable/uncomfortable. Three superordinate categories emerged: Status, Physical Well-Being and Psychological Well-Being. Two theoretical models emerged from the research: (1) Symbols <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> Dress in Female Slave Narratives which described the binary themes describing <b>African</b> <b>American</b> slave dress and (2) Symbolic Meaning <b>of</b> Appearance <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> Slaves in the Nineteenth Century United States which described the interconnectedness of the superordinate themes describing the meanings <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> slave appearances. The Conditional Matrix <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> Slaves in Nineteenth Century Slave Narratives was constructed to evaluate the superordinate themes. The contribution of this study is the understanding <b>of</b> symbols <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> dress and appearance and the construction of grounded theory with applicability to the study of communicative effects <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> dress and appearance at other social times and social contexts and for male clothing. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine teacher {{perceptions}} of third and fourth grade <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students who might be selected for the gifted and talented program. It is the first study concerning teachers? perceptions <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students in an urban school district with a relatively high representation <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students and teachers in the gifted and talented program. The results showed the improvement in <b>African</b> <b>American</b> representation in gifted and talented programs that can result from positive teacher perceptions <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students. Since these positive perceptions may be due, at least in part, to the high proportion <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> teachers in the school district under study, these results suggest a link between an increased proportion <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> teachers, positive teacher perceptions <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students and an improvement in <b>African</b> <b>American</b> representation in gifted and talented programs. Public educational policy should strive to increase the proportion <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> teachers. This could be achieved by modifying standardized tests used for teacher certification, which researchers have shown to be biased against minority cultures, and also by university recruitment to attract <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> to education. The results also suggest the need for increased levels of multicultural and urban courses as a standard part of pre-service teacher education. Quality instruction in these areas can contribute toward a greater understanding among teachers of the effect of culture in the classroom and, thereby reduce the tendency to form low expectations <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> and other minority students. This indulgence in deficit thinking needs an aggressive intervention before prospective teachers enter the classroom where some may propagate the detrimental effects of low teacher expectations on another generation <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students. Increased levels of multicultural and urban education among teachers can also help teachers understand how to interact with <b>African</b> <b>American</b> parents in a constructive manner. This is an important step in creating a school environment, which encourages parental school involvement and, thereby allows <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students readily to enjoy more the academic benefits of parental involvement.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} teacher bias {{in elementary}} school through a thorough investigation of prior research focused on this topic, along with historical accounts <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> education. The basic question of the thesis is: To what extent does teacher bias affect the educational experiences <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students and lead to a persistent educational gap between <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and whites? The study found that teacher bias <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students does exist particularly those from low-income neighborhoods. Moreover, the biases are based on certain assumptions that {{can be traced to}} the historical discrimination <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> in education, as well as assumptions about how <b>African</b> <b>American</b> cultural capital and socioeconomic status influence their value of education. In conclusion, the findings suggest that although policies and guidelines exist, there is room where personal biases based on stereotypes impact 5 decision making points and 8 judgement areas that negatively influence disciplinary dispositions and the academic evaluation <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students.
