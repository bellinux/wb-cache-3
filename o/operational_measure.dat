40|$|University of Minnesota Master of Science thesis. August 2014. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Dr. Eil Kwon. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 149 pages. Snow storms degenerate safety and traffic mobility by creating adverse driving conditions including visibility impairments, reducing pavement friction, obstructed road facilities. Improving {{the effectiveness of}} the snow management requires an efficient assessment of the operational strategies with the data that can be directly measureable from the field. While there have been various types of <b>operational</b> <b>measures</b> used in the state DOTs in the US, the traffic data-based <b>operational</b> <b>measures</b> that can quantify the effects of snow plowing activities are still lacking. To be sure, the existing approaches developed to date employed the variations of traffic speed or travel time during the snow events and those measures cannot fully reflect the road weather conditions when traffic is congested. Developing the <b>operational</b> <b>measures</b> that can objectively and accurately reflect the time-variant road weather conditions is essential in improving {{the effectiveness of the}} snow management strategies. In this research, an automatic process is developed for estimating the traffic data-based <b>operational</b> <b>measures</b> for winter snow management. Those measures include the Road Condition Recovery Time (RCR), the estimate of the `bare-lane regain time', which is the major performance measure of the winter snow maintenance operations at the Minnesota Department of Transportation. The automatic process was then applied to a sample snow section in Twin Cities, MN. The results of the example application showed that the <b>operational</b> <b>measures</b> can reasonably measure the performance of snow plowing operations by reflecting the impacts of the traffic flow resulted by the time-variant road weather conditions...|$|R
50|$|The {{time scale}} of the {{stochastic}} process may be calendar or clock time or some more <b>operational</b> <b>measure</b> of time progression, such as mileage of a car, accumulated {{wear and tear on}} a machine component or accumulated exposure to toxic fumes. In many applications, the stochastic process describing the system state is latent or unobservable and its properties must be inferred indirectly from censored time-to-event data and/or readings taken over time on correlated processes, such as marker processes. The word ‘regression’ in threshold regression refers to first-hitting-time models in which one or more regression structures are inserted into the model in order to connect model parameters to explanatory variables or covariates. The parameters given regression structures may be parameters of the stochastic process, the threshold state and/or the time scale itself.|$|E

We propose an operational definition of homebound status, and we measure its validity for community-dwelling elderly in the Massachusetts Health Care Panel Study (MHCPS). The MHCPS is a longitudinal study of a cohort of elderly persons (N = 1, 625), which began in 1974, with follow-up surveys in 1976, 1980, and 1985. Validity was measured by comparing responses from the <b>operational</b> <b>measure</b> to persons' responses to questions that we judged should {{be associated with a}} valid measure of homebound status.

These results underscore the need for researchers investigating the homebound to discuss the validity and limitations of their homebound measures, and in what context these measures are useful...|$|E

Business interruption (BI) insurance offers firms a financial mechanism for managing {{their exposure to}} disruption risk. Firms can also avail of <b>operational</b> <b>measures</b> to manage the risk. In this paper we explore the relationship between BI insurance and <b>operational</b> <b>measures.</b> We model a manufacturing firm that can purchase BI insurance, invest in inventory and avail of emergency sourcing. Allowing the insurance premium {{to depend on the}} firm’s insurance and operational decisions, we characterize the optimal insurance deductible and coverage limit as well as the optimal inventory level. We prove that insurance and <b>operational</b> <b>measures</b> are not always substitutes, and establish conditions under which they can be complements; that is, insurance leads to a higher inventory investment and/or a larger benefit from emergency sourcing. We also find that the value of insurance is higher for those firms less able to absorb the post-disruption consequences of financially significant disruptions. As disruptions become longer-but-rarer, the value of emergency sourcing increases, and the value of inventory and the value of insurance increase before eventually decreasing. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{emphasis}} placed on physicians’ lifelong learning, no psychometrically sound instrument has been developed to provide an <b>operational</b> <b>measure</b> of the concept and its components among physicians. The authors designed this study to develop a tool for measuring physician lifelong learning, to identify its underlying components and to assess its psychometric properties. A 37 -item questionnaire was developed, based on a review of literature {{and the results of}} two pilot studies. Psychometric analyses of the responses of 160 physicians identified 19 items that were included in the Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning. Factor analysis of the 19 items showed five meaningful factors that were consistent with the definition and major features of lifelong learning. They were ‘need recognition’, ‘research endeavor’, ‘self-initiation’, ‘technical skills’ and ‘personal motivation’. The method of contrasted groups provided evidence in support of the validity of the five factors. The factors’ reliability was assessed by coefficient alpha.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{many problems}} related to the design for change and flexibility of school buildings. The problem of change proves to be highly complex due to the unpredictability {{and the difficulty of}} measuring change. Many deficiencies have been identified in the previous methods concerning lack of indicators for measuring flexibility, reliability and insufficiency of data for indicating change in buildings over use. In the light of the above problems, two main objectives have been established: (i) to propose <b>operational</b> <b>measures</b> of the extent of incorporation of design variables in school designs, and (ii) to propose <b>operational</b> <b>measures</b> of the extent of flexibility of school buildings in use. However, due to the limitations this paper is bound to, the investigation will focus on the second objective. It is anticipated that such <b>operational</b> <b>measures</b> might provide a framework for both architects and researchers, during the early design stage, to ensure that their conjectures about the potential of flexibility might be enhanced during use, hence, improving their prediction of buildings performance over use.
