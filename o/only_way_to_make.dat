5|$|Samar {{notices that}} Meera often prays at church. After {{a night of}} wild street dancing, they begin to fall in love. Samar helps Meera face her past, taking her to visit her estranged mother and foster reconciliation. Meera decides to confess to her father about Samar and break her engagement, but when Samar has a {{motorbike}} accident, Meera, believing she {{is the cause of}} his bad luck, prays to God to save his life, swearing never to see him again. Samar recovers and Meera reveals the vow she made. Angry, he leaves her and London altogether, challenging God to keep him alive as he risks his life every day. He believes his death is the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Meera lose her faith in God. He goes to India and enlists in the army, becoming a bomb-disposal expert.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} to Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{was much more}} difficult from the east, the American-held side, than from the west, the North Korean side. On the east side there was no road climbing halfway to the top; {{from the base of}} the mountain at the edge of the Haman valley the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the ascent was by foot trail. Climbers took two to three hours to reach the top of P'il-bong from the reservoir area, and required from three to four hours to get on top of Battle Mountain from the valley floor. The turnaround time for supply trains to Battle Mountain was six hours. Often a dispatch runner required eight hours to go up Battle Mountain and come back down. In some places the trail was so steep that climbers had to set up ropes to hold along the side of the trail. North Korean night patrols constantly cut telephone lines. The wire men had a difficult and dangerous job trying to maintain wire communication with units on the mountain. Food, water and ammunition were frequently short for the units at the tops of the peaks.|$|E
25|$|Gauss {{also claimed}} to have {{discovered}} the possibility of non-Euclidean geometries but never published it. This discovery was a major paradigm shift in mathematics, as it freed mathematicians from the mistaken belief that Euclid's axioms were the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> geometry consistent and non-contradictory.|$|E

25|$|After {{leaving the}} Lake District, Dalton {{returned}} annually {{to spend his}} holidays studying meteorology, something which involved a lot of hill-walking. Until the advent of aeroplanes and weather balloons, the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> measurements of temperature and humidity at altitude was to climb a mountain. The altitude achieved was estimated using a barometer. Until the Ordnance Survey published maps for the Lake District in the 1860s, Dalton {{was one of the}} few sources of such information. Dalton was often accompanied by Jonathan Otley, who {{was one of the few}} other authorities on the heights of the Lake District mountains. Otley became both an assistant and a friend.|$|E
25|$|Ze'evi later {{advocated}} the population transfer by agreement of 3.3 million {{residents of the}} West Bank and Gaza to Arab nations. He believed this could be accomplished by making life difficult, so they would relocate on their own, through {{use of military force}} during wartime, or by agreement with Arab nations. In July 1987, Ze'evi presented his ideas at a forum in Tel Aviv, describing the plan as a voluntary transfer and the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> peace with the Arabs. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Ze'evi proposed transferring Palestinians to {{the east side of the}} Jordan River to serve as a buffer zone against any Iraqi attempt to attack Israel.|$|E
25|$|In turn, 20th Century Fox {{handed the}} project to William Dozier and his {{production}} company, Greenway Productions. ABC and Fox were expecting a hip and fun—yet still serious—adventure show. However, Dozier, who had never before read comic books, concluded, after reading several Batman comics for research, that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the show work was {{to do it as}} a pop-art campy comedy. Originally, espionage novelist Eric Ambler was to have scripted a TV movie that would launch the television series, but he dropped out after learning of Dozier's campy comedy approach. Eventually, two sets of screen tests were filmed, one with Adam West and Burt Ward and the other with Lyle Waggoner and Peter Deyell, with West and Ward winning the roles.|$|E

500|$|After the revolution, newly freed {{slaves were}} violently opposed to {{remaining}} on plantations, but Dessalines, like Louverture, used military might {{to keep them}} there, thinking that plantation labor was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the economy function.

500|$|In January 2014, Havas Worldwide and the Turkish {{branch of}} the condom company Durex created a {{television}} commercial titled [...] "Farewell Elizabeth" [...] that parodied Oobi. It featured a man breaking up with his girlfriend and resorting to dating his right hand, which was dressed up {{like one of the}} characters from the series. The Oobi hand puppet (named [...] "Elizabeth") was intended to be a metaphor for masturbation, which is generally regarded as a taboo subject in the country. The company had produced other anti-masturbation advertisements in the past, all of which were unsuccessful in Turkey. Havas Worldwide stated in an interview with La República that they chose to parody Oobi after deciding that doing [...] "something never said or done" [...] before would be the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such a commercial popular with Turkish viewers.|$|E

500|$|In March 2009, Lions Gate Entertainment {{entered into}} a co-production {{agreement}} for The Hunger Games with Nina Jacobson's production company Color Force, which had acquired worldwide distribution rights to the novel a few weeks earlier. The studio, which had not made a profit for five years, raided the budgets of other productions and sold assets to secure a budget of $88,000,000 – one of its largest ever – for the film. Collins' agent Jason Dravis remarked that [...] "they [...] had everyone but the valet call us" [...] to help secure the franchise. Intending the film to have a PG-13 rating, Collins adapted the novel for film herself, in collaboration with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross. The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, with Ross saying he [...] "felt the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the film really successful was to be totally subjective" [...] in its presentation of events, echoing Collins' use of first person present in the novel.|$|E
500|$|Roadside Development {{proposed}} a significantly expanded redevelopment in June 2004 that included most of Square 422. The company {{determined that the}} <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the O Street Market viable was to greatly enhance parking at the site. It could not do so without building extensive underground parking, and to build the parking garage would require construction of new buildings adjacent to the O Street Market and the Giant Food grocery store. The company initially {{proposed a}} $100 million project consisting of new construction and renovations which would add condominiums, apartments, a two-story underground parking garage, and either a new or renovated grocery store. By March 2005, when Roadside Development won its first design and zoning approval reviews, the plan had expanded into a $260 million project which included a 180-room hotel, 300 condominiums, 300 apartments, 700 underground parking spaces, and [...] of new retail space. The O Street Market would be restored, renovated and incorporated into a new [...] Giant Food store. [...] The proposal also called {{for the city to}} reopen 8th Street NW.|$|E
500|$|After {{the energy}} disturbance, Jackson's spirit takes over Ike's body, causing Ike to speak, {{sing and dance}} like Jackson himself. The boys find from online {{research}} that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Jackson accept his death is to make him experience the acceptance he sought in life, so they take him to a child beauty pageant for young girls. Dressed like a little girl, Ike/Jackson impresses two of the male judges by singing a tune sounding similar to Jackson's [...] "You Are Not Alone," [...] but they are promptly arrested for masturbating while watching the children, leaving a single, unimpressed female judge (much to {{the shock of the}} boys, who were unaware of the men's lewd acts and considered them the best judges). When Cartman notices the judge eating Chipotle, he bribes her with knowledge about the ChipotlAway product, and she declares Ike/Jackson the winner as a result. One of the other contestants is physically beaten by her mother for losing. Having found his acceptance, Jackson leaves Ike's body, and Ike is extremely surprised and disgusted to find himself dressed like a little girl.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I think {{that might be the}} original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly.

The song begins with an introductory verse from Mill, followed by Ross on the second verse. Though [...] "cooing" [...] throughout the chorus, Carey's begins singing during the song's bridge and final crescendo, where she displays her whistle register.
