40|$|SUMMARY: A {{theoretical}} {{treatment of}} <b>continuous</b> <b>culture</b> is given, which allows quantitative prediction of the steady-state concentrations of bacteria and substrate in the culture, {{and how these}} {{may be expected to}} vary with change of medium, concentration and flow-rate. The layout and operation of a small pilot plant for the <b>continuous</b> <b>culture</b> of bacteria are described. This plant has been operated continuously for periods of up to 4 months without breakdown or contamination of the culture. No alterations in the properties of the organisms studied have occurred during such periods of <b>continuous</b> <b>culture.</b> Results are given of a series of experiments on the <b>continuous</b> <b>culture</b> of Aerobacter cloacae in a chemically defined medium, designed to allow quantitative comparison with the results predicted by the theory. The rela-tive advantages of batch and <b>continuous</b> <b>culture</b> as production processes are discussed, and it is concluded that <b>continuous</b> <b>culture</b> may usually be expected to show a five to tenfold increase in output as compared with a batch process.

40|$|The {{heyday of}} <b>continuous</b> <b>culture</b> {{was in the}} 1960 s, when its {{versatility}} and reproducibility were used to address fundamental problems in diverse microbiological fields such as biochemistry, ecology, genetics and physiology.

40|$|Maximizing {{the flow}} of {{metabolic}} hydrogen ([H]) in the rumen away from CH 4 and towards volatile fatty acids (VFA) would increase the efficiency of ruminant production and decrease its environmental impact. The objectives of this meta-analysis were: i) To quantify shifts in metabolic hydrogen sinks when inhibiting ruminal methanogenesis in vitro; and ii) To understand the variation in shifts of metabolic hydrogen sinks among experiments and between batch and <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures</b> systems when methanogenesis is inhibited. Batch (28 experiments, N= 193) and continuous (16 experiments, N= 79) culture databases of experiments with at least 50 % inhibition in CH 4 production were compiled. Inhibiting methanogenesis generally resulted in less fermentation and digestion in most batch culture, but not in most <b>continuous</b> <b>culture,</b> experiments. Inhibiting CH 4 production in batch cultures resulted in redirection of metabolic hydrogen towards propionate and H 2 but not butyrate. In <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures,</b> there was no overall metabolic hydrogen redirection towards propionate or butyrate, and H 2 {{as a proportion of}} metabolic hydrogen spared from CH 4 production was numerically smaller compared to batch cultures.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{physiological}} factors and {{their relation to}} the solventogenesis mechanism were investigated in both batch and <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures</b> of Clostridium acetobutylicum. The initiation of butanol formation in batch culture correlates best with minimum levels of undissociated butyric acid in the medium. Weak organic acids have uncoupling characteristics and effect a concentration-dependent decrease in the transmembrane ΔpH and the intracellular pH (pHi). The pHi decreases continuously from 7. 0 to 5. 5 in batch cultures and cell growth terminates when the pHi drops below 5. 5. Product selectivities in <b>continuous</b> <b>culture</b> are dependent on the supply and demand of biosynthetic energy. Glucose limitation leads to ATP-limited culture conditions and acid formation. By contrast, glucose-sufficient fermentations are characterized by high intracellular ATP concentrations and elevated solvent yields. Carbon monoxide gassing of an acidogenic <b>continuous</b> <b>culture</b> leads to increased levels of intracellular ATP and NAD(P) H concentrations as well as elevated pH i and ΔpH values. The formation of butanol in <b>continuous</b> <b>culture</b> is primarily regulated at the genetic level via expression of NADP-specific butyraldehyde dehydrogenase (BYDH (NADP)). Addition of glucose, butyric acid and carbon monoxide results in induction of this enzyme. In contrast to <b>continuous</b> <b>culture,</b> in vitro activities of BYDH (NADP) do not correlate with solventogenesis in controlled pH batch fermentations. The production of acetone in continuous fermentations is also controlled at the genetic level through expression of CoA-transferase (COA-T). This enzyme is induced by glucose. Acetoacetate decarboxylase (ACACDE) is inactivated by carbon monoxide. The production of acetone in controlled pH batch fermentations is regulated at the genetic level through the combined induction of both CoA-transferase and acetoacetate decarboxylase. Neither in vitro activities of COA-T and ACACDE nor acetone formation could be detected above pH 6. 0 in either batch or <b>continuous</b> <b>culture.</b> The formation of organic acids by Clostridium acetobutylicum appears to be controlled at the enzyme level. Several possible control mechanisms operating at the enzyme level are discussed. Finally, the uptake of butyrate is not necessarily linked to acetone formation and can proceed via {{a reversal of the}} phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate kinase reaction pathway...|$|R
30|$|Feeding non-sterilized or sterilized medium did {{not show}} {{significant}} differences (P >  0.05), regarding the kinetic parameters (Table  1 B). It {{is worth noting that}} microbial contamination was not observed even when non-sterilized medium was fed. Acid pH values (from 2.6 to 3) found during the cultures (Table  1), might have limited microbial contamination. This low pH condition suggested a reduced probability of contamination for prolonged <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures</b> and explained why {{no significant differences were found}} between <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures</b> fed with sterilized or non-sterilized media. This finding could positively impact the economic balance of the industrial production of tequila.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to compare CA {{production}} in <b>continuous</b> <b>culture</b> with and without cell recycling and in batch process by Streptomyces clavuligerus. Continuous cultivations with high cell concentration using cell recycling were performed utilizing a hollow fiber ultrafiltration module to separate cells from the filtrate broth. The <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures</b> without cell recycling and the batch cultivations were performed conventionally. The highest productivity was attained in the continuous cultivation with cell recycling (22. 2 mg. L- 1. h- 1). The highest CA concentration was obtained in the batch process (470 mg.

Survival of two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, a Xanthomonas maltophilia strain, and an Escherichia coli strain was monitored in single-stage and two-stage <b>continuous</b> <b>cultures</b> of mouse caecal bacteria. Comparisons were made between their survival in 6 itro and in previous mouse dosing studies. Colonization resistance of the continuous flow models resulted in elimination of all four strains at a rate similar to, or faster than the washout rate. Neither in 6 itro system was able to reproduce in 6 i 6 o findings with regard to the colonization capabilities of these microorganisms with potential for use as biotechnology agents.
