The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps.

5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general public about the effect of {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis <b>of</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E

MethodRetrospective analysis of clinical and EEG data of 201 patients with JME who had at least 3 years follow up was performed. Psychiatric evaluation was performed using ICD- 10 by structured clinical interview. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups: VPA responders (seizure free for 2 or more years) and those with lack <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> VPA. Effect size for non-response and correlations for variables significantly different between the groups was performed, the findings were confirmed by ROC curves. ResultsThe mean duration of follow up was 7. 75 (range 3 – 12) years; 55. 2 % were males. Focal semiologic features were noted is 16 %. EEG was abnormal in 67 %; focal EEG abnormalities were noted in 32. 8 %. Coexisting psychiatric disorders (PDs) were found in 33. 3 %. Lack <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> VPA was noted in 19 %. Diagnosis of PDs and focal EEG abnormalities significantly increased the risk of VPA non-responsiveness by 5. 54 (95 % CI of 2. 60 – 11. 80; p< 0. 0001) and 3. 01 times respectively (95 % CI of 1. 40 – 6. 47; p< 0. 008).

40|$|<b>Response</b> <b>to</b> {{treatment}} <b>of</b> {{rheumatoid arthritis}} shows large inter-individual variability. This heterogeneity is observed {{with all the}} anti-rheumatic drugs, including the commonly used TNF inhibitors. It seems that drug-specific and target-specific factors lead individual patients to respond or not to a given drug, although this point has been challenged. The search of biomarkers distinguishing responders from non-responders has included shotgun proteomics of serum, as a previous study <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> infliximab, an anti-TNF antibody. Here, we have used the same study design and technology <b>to</b> search biomarkers <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> a different anti-TNF antibody, adalimumab, and we have compared the results obtained for the two anti-TNF drugs. Search <b>of</b> biomarkers <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> adalimumab included depletion of the most abundant serum proteins, 8 -plex isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling, two-dimensional liquid chromatography fractionation and relative quantification with a hybrid Orbitrap mass spectrometer. With this approach, 264 proteins were identified in all the samples with at least 2 peptides and 95 % confidence. Nine proteins showed differences between non-responders and responders (P < 0. 05), representing putative biomarkers <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> adalimumab. These results were compared with the previous study of infliximab. Surprisingly, the non-responder/responder differences in the two studies were not correlated (rs = 0. 07; P = 0. 40). This overall independence with all the proteins showed two identifiable components. On one side, the putative biomarkers <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> either adalimumab or infliximab, which were not shared and showed an inverse correlation (rs = - 0. 69; P = 0. 0023).

To address this question, we measured patterns <b>of</b> EEG <b>response</b> <b>to</b> intact and scrambled images in the human brain. Our rationale for using scrambled images is that they have many of the visual properties found in intact images, but do not convey any semantic information. Images from different object categories (bottle, face, house) were briefly presented (400 ms) in an event-related design. A multivariate pattern analysis revealed categorical patterns <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> intact images emerged ∼ 80 – 100 ms after stimulus onset and were still evident when the stimulus was no longer present (∼ 800 ms). Next, we measured the patterns <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> scrambled images. Categorical patterns <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> scrambled images also emerged ∼ 80 – 100 ms after stimulus onset. However, in contrast to the intact images, distinct patterns <b>of</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> scrambled images were mostly evident while the stimulus was present (∼ 400 ms). Moreover, scrambled images were able to account only for all the variance in the intact images at early stages of processing. This direct manipulation of visual and semantic content provides new insights into the temporal dynamics of object perception and the extent to which different stages of processing are dependent on lower-level or higher-level properties of the image...|$|R
