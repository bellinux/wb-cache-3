40|$|From 1972 to 2013, California {{school districts}} {{received}} general purpose funds {{known as a}} “revenue limit” through a mix of local property taxes and state aid. Some districts, known as “basic aid ” or “excess tax” districts, fund their revenue limit entirely through property taxes and receive no general purpose state aid. They also retain any excess property taxes within their district. Starting in 2013 – 14, a district’s general purpose funds will be calculated through a new Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF). As under the revenue limit system, the LCFF <b>entitlement</b> <b>will</b> be financed through a mix of property taxes and state aid. Although the LCFF <b>entitlement</b> <b>will</b> be greater than the revenue limit entitlement for most districts, {{a majority of the}} current basic aid districts will retain their status. This report focuses on basic aid districts. It describes how districts attain basic aid status and examines how basic aid districts differ from other school districts in their demographic characteristics. Basic aid districts are generally more advantaged than other districts. Their residents have higher average salaries and home values. However, they are not a homogenous group of districts. They are concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area and along California’s eastern border with Nevada; and as one might expect, when basic aid districts are categorized by their geographic location, differences emerge. Coastal basic aid districts have more educated and wealthy residents and very high home prices, while inland basic aid districts tend to b...|$|R

50|$|The {{court held}} that, where a son {{is given a}} {{fiduciary}} interest in property under his father's will, the son's interest ceases upon his death and he cannot dispose of it by will. Furthermore, a sale of such share does not free it from the fideicommissum. A clause disqualifying any son who became insolvent from obtaining a right under the will did not operate to disqualify an insolvent who was a fideicommissary under the will but who was rehabilitated before the right of succession accrued to him. Thus a condition that the bequest <b>will</b> <b>lapse</b> if the beneficiary becomes insolvent is not contra bonos mores.|$|R

Split estates, where landowners control the surface and the energy companies lease {{the rights to the}} underground gas from the federal government, often impede successful negotiations for methane extraction. We provide an extensive form representation of the dynamic game of the negotiation process for subsurface access. We then solve for a set of Nash equilibrium outcomes associated with the split estate negotiations. By examining the optimal offers we can identify methods to improve the likelihood of negotiations that do not break down and result in the gas developer resorting to the use of a bond. We examine how changes in transaction costs or <b>entitlements</b> <b>will</b> affect the outcomes, and support our finds with anecdotal evidence from actual negotiations for coal-bed methane access. ...|$|R

In this paper, we devise, and implement, an experimental protocol that allows for a strong test {{of the effects of}} private information. We hypothesize that making information private will have only a limited effect on subjects’ abilities to reach Pareto efficient bargains or on the effect that <b>entitlements</b> <b>will</b> have on the outcome; but that considerations of equity will become less important.

Although Sen acknowledges this, he expresses his theory in individualistic terms and makes little allowance for culture or social structure. The present paper draws from recent social theory {{to discuss how}} the capability approach could be developed to give an explicit treatment of cultural and structural matters. Capabilities depend not only on entitlements but on institutional roles and personal relations: these can be represented openly if capabilities are disaggregated into individual, social and structural capacities. The three layers interact, and a full analysis of capabilities should consider them all. A stratified method implies that raising <b>entitlements</b> <b>will</b> not on its own be enough to enhance capabilities and that cultural and structural changes will be needed. capability approach, culture, human agency, social structure, social policy,...|$|R
