5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the gay community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E
5|$|More recently, the Boy Scouts of America was {{the focus}} of {{criticism}} in the United States for not allowing the open participation <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> until removing the prohibition in 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Sexual Preference {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} the psychologist Clarence Tripp in the Journal of Sex Research and the sociologist Ira Reiss in Contemporary Sociology, mixed reviews from the sociologist John DeLamater in Science and the sex researcher James D. Weinrich in The Quarterly Review of Biology, {{and a positive}} review from J. Kenneth Davidson, Sr. in the Journal of Marriage and Family. Criticisms made of the work included that its authors' conclusions were based on an unrepresentative or dubiously representative sample <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals,</b> and that their reliance on path analysis and adult recall of early childhood feeling was problematic.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2006 {{commentary}} on the document, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger remarked that its description <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> acts as [...] "intrinsically disordered" [...] was misinterpreted by some as permitting the qualification <b>of</b> the <b>homosexual</b> tendency as neutral or even good, an idea rejected also in the 1986 Letter on the Pastoral Care <b>of</b> <b>Homosexual</b> Persons.|$|R
25|$|Adultery and incestual {{relationships}} (Leviticus 18:6–23) are prohibited.

50|$|First-generation {{immigrants}} tend to hold less accepting views <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> lifestyles but opposition weakens {{with longer}} stays. Second-generation immigrants are overall more accepting <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> lifestyles, but the acculturation effect is weaker for Muslims {{and to some}} extent, Eastern Orthodox migrants.|$|R
5|$|Another stock {{plot device}} in the 1970s was the gay {{character}} in a police drama. They served as victims of blackmail or anti-gay violence, but more often as criminals. Beginning in the late 1960s with N.Y.P.D., Police Story, and Police Woman, the use <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> in stories became much more prevalent, according to Vito Russo, {{as a response to}} their higher profiles in gay activism. Lesbians were included as villains, motivated to murder by their desires, internalized homophobia, or fear of being exposed as homosexual. One episode of Police Woman earned protests by the National Gay Task Force before it aired for portraying a trio of murderous lesbians who killed retirement home patients for their money. NBC edited the episode because of the protests, but a sit-in was staged in the head of NBC's offices.|$|E
5|$|By 1964, {{membership}} {{had risen}} to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand civil liberties. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce {{separation of church and}} state. It defended several anti-war activists during the Vietnam War. The ACLU was involved in the Miranda case, which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in the New York Times case, which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals,</b> students, prisoners, and the poor. In the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of creationism in public schools and challenged some provisions of anti-terrorism legislation as infringing on privacy and civil liberties. Fundraising and membership spiked after the 2016 election; the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.|$|E
5|$|Congressman Phillip Burton, Assemblyman Willie Brown, {{and other}} California {{politicians}} recognized the growing clout and organization <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> in the city, and courted their votes by attending meetings {{of gay and}} lesbian organizations. Brown pushed for legalization of sex between consenting adults in 1969 but failed. SIR was also pursued by popular moderate Supervisor Dianne Feinstein in her bid to become mayor, opposing Alioto. Ex-policeman Richard Hongisto worked for 10 years to change the conservative views of the San Francisco Police Department, and also actively appealed to the gay community, which responded by raising significant funds for his campaign for sheriff. Though Feinstein was unsuccessful, Hongisto's win in 1971 showed the political clout of the gay community.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{environmental}} pollutant methylmercury can increase the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> behavior in male American white ibis. The study involved exposing chicks in varying dosages to the chemical and measuring the degree <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> behavior in adulthood. The results discovered was that as the dosage was increased the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> behavior also increased. The endocrine blocking feature of mercury has been suggested as a possible cause of sexual disruption in other bird species.|$|R

5|$|In 1951, the California Supreme Court affirmed in Stoumen v. Reilly {{the right}} <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> to {{assemble}} peacefully. To assist homosexuals with legal problems, in 1951 labor activist Harry Hay started the Mattachine Society, from {{his living room}} in Los Angeles. A few years later, Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin started the Daughters of Bilitis with six other women in San Francisco, initially {{to have a place}} to socialize without fear of harassment or arrest. Within a few years, both organizations learned of each other and grew to have similar goals: helping assimilate homosexuals into general society, working for legal reform to repeal sodomy laws, and assisting those who were arrested. Both groups were headquartered in San Francisco by 1957.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Sexual Preference {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} the historian Paul Robinson in Psychology Today and Richard P. Halgin in Library Journal, a negative review from the sociologist John Gagnon in The New York Times, a notice in Newsweek, and a discussion in The Chronicle of Higher Education, {{which focused on}} the controversy surrounding the book. The following year, it received a negative review from Michael Ignatieff in the London Review of Books. Reviewers faulted the work on grounds such as the questionable representativeness of its sample <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals,</b> though those who reviewed it positively praised it for reasons including the sophistication of its path analysis.|$|E
5|$|Auschwitz I {{was first}} {{constructed}} to hold Polish political prisoners, {{who began to}} arrive in May 1940. The first extermination of prisoners took place in September 1941, and Auschwitz II–Birkenau {{went on to become}} a major site of the Nazi Final Solution to the Jewish Question. From early 1942 until late 1944, transport trains delivered Jews to the camp's gas chambers from all over German-occupied Europe, where they were killed en masse with the pesticide Zyklon B. An estimated 1.3 million people were sent to the camp, of whom at least 1.1million died. Around 90 percent of those killed were Jewish; approximately 1 in 6 Jews killed in the Holocaust died at the camp. Others deported to Auschwitz included 150,000 Poles, 23,000 Romani and Sinti, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, 400 Jehovah's Witnesses, and tens of thousands of others of diverse nationalities, including an unknown number <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals.</b> Many of those not killed in the gas chambers died of starvation, forced labor, infectious diseases, individual executions, and medical experiments.|$|E

5|$|Seen {{as likely}} to provoke {{controversy}} even before its publication, Sexual Preference received considerable media attention, and reviews that were mainly mixed or negative. Critics questioned Bell et al.′s reliance upon a statistical technique, originally developed {{for use in the}} biological sciences, called path analysis, disputed the representativeness of their sample <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals,</b> pointed out the difficulty and potential unreliability of adult recall of childhood feeling and the vague and general nature of the questions respondents were asked, and disagreed with Bell et al.′s suggestion that sexual orientation is innate. Nevertheless, some reviewers complimented Sexual Preference for its authors' challenge to established views about the causes of homosexuality, and it eventually came to be considered a classic work. It {{is one of the most}} frequently cited retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation, credited by psychologists with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality. In 2009, the American Psychological Association credited Bell et al. with helping to discredit theories attributing sexual orientation to family dynamics or trauma.|$|E
5|$|The Sultan of Brunei's {{stake in}} the {{ownership}} of the hotel drew controversy in April 2014 when he initiated {{the first phase of}} a three-phase plan to adapt Brunei's legal system to include aspects of Sharia law implicating his approval of the persecution <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> in the complex legal system there (a two part system involving separate courts and legislation for Islamic and non-Islamic citizens). In protest, a United States national LGBT advocacy organization, the Gill Action Fund, canceled its reservation to hold a conference of major donors at the Beverly Hills Hotel and demanded a refund of its deposit. The hotel management responded by issuing a statement asserting that it does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. Fashion designers Brian Atwood and Peter Som subsequently called for wider protests, urging the fashion industry to boycott all of the hotels owned by the Dorchester Collection.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first {{instances}} <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' Black Cat Tavern in 1967. However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the raid was a factor: it was {{across the street from}} The Village Voice offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police. Many of the participants and residents of Greenwich Village were involved in political organizations that were effectively able to mobilize a large and cohesive gay community {{in the weeks and months}} after the rebellion. The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual Gay Pride events around the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{public image}} <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> changed with liberalized social {{attitudes of the}} late 1960s. In 1969, the Stonewall riots {{occurred}} in New York City, marking {{the start of the}} gay rights movement. Though gay life in Miami was intensely closeted, and bars were subject to frequent raids, Christ Metropolitan Community Church—a congregation for gay and lesbian Christians in Miami—was founded in 1970 as a religious outlet, attracting hundreds of parishioners. The 1972 Democratic National Convention was held in Miami, featuring, for the first time, a public speech about the rights of gay men and lesbians by openly gay San Francisco political activist Jim Foster. Jack Campbell opened the Miami branch of Club Baths in 1974. When it was raided, he made sure that all charges against those arrested were dropped, filed a lawsuit against the Miami Police Department prohibiting further harassment, and received a formal apology from the police. Even the depiction of gay men and lesbians in the local newspaper had changed to that of a silent, oppressed minority. By 1977, Miami was one of nearly 40cities in the U.S. that had passed ordinances outlawing discrimination against gay men and lesbians.|$|E

The essay, in which Duncan compared the plight <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> with that of African Americans and Jews, was published in Dwight Macdonald's journal politics. Duncan's essay is considered a pioneering treatise on the experience <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> in American society given its appearance a full decade before any organized gay rights movement (Mattachine Society). In 1951 Duncan met the artist Jess Collins and began a collaboration and partnership that lasted until Duncan's death 37 years later.|$|E
