5|$|Warwick's sister, and {{therefore}} Edward IV's niece, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, was executed by Henry VIII in 1541. By then, {{the cause was}} more religious and political rather than dynastic. The attainder of her father, Clarence, was a legal bar to any claims to the throne by his children. Additionally her marriage, arranged by Henry VII, to Sir Richard Pole, his half-cousin and trusted supporter, was not auspicious. Nevertheless, it did allow the couple to be closely involved in court affairs. Margaret's fortunes improved under Henry VIII and in February 1512 she was restored to the earldom of Salisbury and all the Warwicks' lands. This made her the first and, apart from Anne Boleyn, the <b>only</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> 16th-century England to hold a peerage title in her own right.|$|E

Riipinen was among the most radical in the IKL parliamentary group, receiving a warning for impetuosity from the party. She was supportive of the fascist regimes of Italy and Germany in her speeches, a line which was not mainstream in the IKL. She also conflicted with the IKL leadership when she led the women's section for the party, with male IKL leadership seizing a board meeting to prevent what they saw as harmful decisions.|$|E

25|$|While Zaharias {{missed the}} cut in the 1938 PGA Tour event, later, as she became more experienced, she made the cut in every PGA Tour event she entered. In January 1945, Zaharias played in three PGA tournaments. She shot 76–76 {{to qualify for the}} Los Angeles Open. She then shot 76–81 to make the two-day cut in the tournament itself, but missed the three-day cut after a 79, making her the first (and {{currently}} <b>only)</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> history to make the cut in a regular PGA Tour event. She continued her cut streak at the Phoenix Open, where she shot 77–72–75–80, finishing in 33rd place. At the Tucson Open, she qualified by shooting 74–81 and then shot a 307 in the tournament and finished tied for 42nd. Unlike other female golfers competing in men's events, she got into the Los Angeles and Tucson Opens through 36-hole qualifiers, as opposed to a sponsor's exemption.|$|E
25|$|Green is {{probably}} most noted {{for her work}} helping to develop the legislation that was to become TitleIX, now-called the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act. The law prohibited sex discrimination in federally funded educational institutions. In the late 1960s, after noting that while programs existed to keep boys in school but no similar programs existed for girls, Green sought to correct this inequity. She helped to introduce a higher education bill that contained provisions regarding gender equity in education. The hearings on this bill, working together with fellow Representative Patsy Mink and Senator Birch Bayh, eventually resulted in the passage of TitleIX in 1972. In addition Green was fundamental in introducing and penning the successful Equal Pay Act of 1963 and in the following year, she was the <b>only</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the House of Representatives who voted against including sex in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, {{saying that it was}} neither the time nor the place for addressing {{discrimination on the basis of}} sex in employment.|$|E
