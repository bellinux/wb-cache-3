5000|$|Reviewing the 1972 show models, UK monthly {{magazine}} Motorcycle Mechanics {{described the}} CB500 as [...] "one of the 'show stealers'. Four cylinders, in-line across the frame, four carburettors and single <b>overhead</b> camshaft <b>motor,</b> coupled to a five-speed gearbox give this 500 cc machine {{the performance of}} a 650 twin cylinder bike".|$|R
50|$|Some {{overhead}} cam engines employ short rocker arms {{in which the}} cam lobe pushes down (rather than up) on the rocker arm to open the valve. On this type of rocker arm, the fulcrum {{is at the end}} rather than the middle, while the cam acts on the middle of the arm. The opposite end opens the valve. These types of rocker arms are particularly common on dual <b>overhead</b> cam <b>motors,</b> and are often used instead of direct tappets.|$|R
50|$|The Evolution Big Twin motor was, {{until the}} {{introduction}} of the Twin Cam engine, the last of the line of single cam, <b>overhead</b> valve <b>motors</b> tracing their lineage back to the seminal Knucklehead design penned by founder Bill Harley. It is also the largest aftermarket supported Harley-Davidson design, to date, with clones of the engine being produced by third parties like S&S Cycle and several others. Harley reverted to a single cam design with the Milwaukee-Eight engine, first introduced for touring models in 2016.|$|R
50|$|The inaugural AE85 model's {{standard}} equipment included Toyota's 3A-U carburetor-equipped Single <b>Overhead</b> Cam (SOHC) <b>motor</b> displacing 1,452cc(cubic centimeter) and K50 cable-clutch transmission. It featured drum brakes, and {{rack and pinion}} steering. It did not incorporate the limited-slip differential (LSD) or rear disc brakes of the higher-performing AE86.|$|R
50|$|The Topolino {{was one of}} the {{smallest}} cars in the world {{at the time of its}} production. Launched in 1937, three models were produced until 1955, all with only minor mechanical and cosmetic changes. It was equipped with a 569 cc four-cylinder, side-valve, water-cooled engine mounted in front of the front axle, (later an <b>overhead</b> valve <b>motor)</b> and so was a full-scale car rather than a cyclecar. The radiator was located behind the engine which made possible a lowered aerodynamic nose profile at a time when competitors had a flat, nearly vertical grille. The shape of the car's front allowed exceptional forward visibility.|$|R
50|$|In Le Havre {{as well as}} {{in cities}} across France, {{increase}} in car transport encouraged Le Havre city council to set up one-way streets. The tramway and trolleybus operator was faced with a large bill to extend its network further into the suburbs and so decided to replace all its <b>overhead</b> vehicles with <b>motor</b> buses on 28 December 1970.|$|R
50|$|The Harley-Davidson Twin Cam {{engines are}} {{motorcycle}} engines made by Harley-Davidson since 1998. Although these engines differed {{significantly from the}} Evolution engine, which in turn {{was derived from the}} series of single camshaft, <b>overhead</b> valve <b>motors</b> that were first released in 1936, they share a number of characteristics with nearly all previous Harley-Davidson engines. Both engines have two cylinders in a V-twin configuration at 45°, are air-cooled (some touring models use liquid cooling for the heads), and activate valves with push-rods. The crankshafts have a single pin with a knife and fork arrangement for the connecting rods. These are sandwiched between a pair of flywheels.|$|R
50|$|Rootes UK updated the Hillman Minx every year, usually {{releasing}} {{a new model}} late in the year. Thus the Mk VI was released in November 1953 to be sold as the 1954 model; then, the Mk VI was revised and became the Mk VII late in 1954. Isuzu followed a similar path, and the PH10 {{was replaced by the}} PH11 (Mk VII Minx) model in August 1954. The PH11 was replaced by the PH12 (Mk VIII Minx) in February 1955. Rootes introduced a new 1390 cc <b>overhead</b> valve <b>motor</b> with the Hillman Mk VIII, and this was also used in the Isuzu built PH12.|$|R

50|$|The Nissan 180SX is a {{fastback}} automobile {{that was}} produced by Nissan Motors between 1988 and 1998. It {{is based on the}} S13 chassis from the Nissan S platform with the variants receiving an R designation (ex. RS13 and RPS13), and was sold exclusively in Japan paired with the CA18 motor in the early models; later models paired with the SR20 motor. Outside Japan it was re-badged as the 200SX and in the US market as the Nissan 240SX paired with the single <b>overhead</b> cam KA24E <b>motor</b> and later with the dual-overhead model KA24DE.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{competing}} systems used {{a separate}} heating system and an engine-mounted compressor, {{driven by the}} engine crankshaft via a belt, with an evaporator in the car's trunk to deliver cold air through the rear parcel shelf and <b>overhead</b> vents. General <b>Motors</b> made a front-mounted air conditioning system optional in 1954 on Pontiacs with a straight-eight engine that added separate controls and air distribution.

5000|$|Initially the {{overhead}} camshaft versions were offered as optional equipment on the 240, becoming standard in all markets by the 1976 model year. The <b>overhead</b> camshaft <b>motors</b> {{were available in}} displacements of 2.0 (B19 and B200), 2.1 (B21), and eventually 2.3 (B23 and B230) litres. The B21 featured an 80 mm stroke, and 92 mm bore. In the US, the B21's power output ranged anywhere between [...] and 107 hp (73 to 80 kW), based on variations in the compression ratio and was typically supplied with a B or M camshaft.The engines are tilted approx 15 degrees to left (exhaust side) {{to make room for}} the more complicated injection systems. B19 and B21 blocks can be identified by water plugs on one side of the block. The B23 blocks have them on both sides. The camshaft is driven by a toothed belt that is driven off the front of the crankshaft. The belt turns the intermediate shaft as well, which in turn drives the oil pump, distributor (on 240 engines and BXX 700/900 series engines) and the fuel pump of carburetor models.|$|R

40|$|While public {{transportation}} {{continues to grow}} in relevance, few ergonomic and biomechanical studies have examined passenger safety, especially related to falls from standing, {{and the role of}} handrail grasping in balance maintenance. In this thesis, I examined forces from upper limbs (from a load cell), lower limbs (from a force-plate) and muscle responses (from EMG) involved in balance recovery during simulated vehicle acceleration and deceleration pulses. Subjects stood (forward or sideways) on a platform holding a handrail in two different positions (shoulder height and <b>overhead).</b> A linear <b>motor</b> accelerated the platform at high and low perturbation magnitudes. Hand configuration, perturbation direction and perturbation magnitude influenced hand forces, COP displacement and muscle activation. Forward stance while holding the handrail at shoulder height increased the musculoskeletal demands of balance maintenance. Improved knowledge from this project should help guide the design of safer vehicles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This work {{presents}} the minimization of water wastage at the overhead tank due to overflow and prevents the motor from running continuously and consumes power unnecessarily. Two conditions are always {{necessary for the}} motor to run. The overhead tank {{to be filled with}} water should be dirt free and there should be enough water at the source from which water is to be drawn. When this two condition are satisfied the motor will run and start filling up the tank. After the water touch a certain level {{at the top of the}} <b>overhead</b> tank, the <b>motor</b> will stop running automatically and prevent the overflow of water. Water level will decrease due to the utilization of water but the motor will still be in off mode state. When the level reached down a certain level at the bottom than the motor will run again and start filling up the overhead tank. Water level indicator is also incorporated along with the work. This work is designed, implemented and simulated as shown in section III. This can be use in any organization, educational institute or domestic house. The main objective of this paper is cost minimization to build the circuit and making it work efficiently...|$|R
50|$|The {{dictatorship}} of Franco forbade {{political parties and}} began a harsh ideological and cultural repression countenanced and sometimes even led by the Church. The financial markets were destabilised, causing a severe economic crisis that led to rationing. A black market in rationed goods existed for over a decade. The Francoist administrations of Valencia silenced publicity of the catastrophic consequences of the floods of 1949 with the attendant dozens of deaths, but could not do the same after the even more tragic flood of 1957 when the river Turia overflowed its banks again, killing many Valencians (officially, eighty-one died; the actual figure is not known). To prevent further disasters, the river was eventually diverted to a new course. The old river bed was abandoned for years, and successive Francoist mayors proposed making it a motorway, but that option was finally rejected {{with the advent of}} democracy and fervent neighbourhood protests. The river was divided in two at the western city limits (Plan Sur de Valencia), and diverted southwards along a new course that skirts the city, before meeting the Mediterranean. The old course of the river continues, dry, through the city centre, almost to the sea. The old riverbed is now a verdant sunken park called the 'Garden of the Turia' (Jardí del Túria or Jardín del Turia) that allows cyclists and pedestrians to traverse much of the city without the use of roads; <b>overhead</b> bridges carry <b>motor</b> traffic across the park.|$|R
