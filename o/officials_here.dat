[...] Upon arriving in Pyongyang on December 16, Richardson told reporters that his [...] "objective is {{to see if we can}} reduce the tension on the Korean peninsula, that is my objective. I am going to have a whole series of talks with North Korean <b>officials</b> <b>here</b> and I look forward to my discussions", he said. [...] On December 19, Richardson said his talks with North Korean officials made [...] "some progress" [...] in trying to resolve what he calls a [...] "very tense" [...] situation. [...] Speaking from Pyongyang, Richardson told U.S. television network CNN that a North Korean general he met was receptive to his proposal for setting up a hotline between North and South Korean forces, and also was open to his idea for a military commission to monitor disputes in and around the Yellow Sea.|$|E

The supply of {{provisions}} of all kinds, of cloth for clothing, and, indeed, of everything but guns and ammunition, {{is in the hands}} of the junta of the province, and of the civil authority here. Many of the members must be concerned in the matter, and I have no doubt that the <b>officials</b> <b>here</b> are heavily bribed to shut their eyes, and to arrange matters so that the frauds may escape attention.|$|E

The <b>officials</b> <b>here</b> are all Gamarra's men, {{and there is not}} one of them who would not take a bribe. But would it be worth while, as we are only going to stay here a week? And if you got them imprisoned they would be out again before I came back, and would be more anxious than ever to get rid of me." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir,--I last {{addressed}} {{you on the}} misconduct {{of certain}} <b>officials</b> <b>here,</b> and I was so far happy as to have had my facts confirmed in every particular with but one exception. That exception, the affair of the dynamite, has been secretly smuggled away; you shall look in vain in either Blue-book or White-book for any mention even of the charge; it is gone like the conjurer's orange. I might have been tempted to inquire into the reason of this conspiracy of silence, whether the idea was conceived in the bosoms of the three Powers themselves, or whether in the breasts of the three Consuls, because one of their number was directly implicated. And I might {{have gone on to}} consider the moral effect of such suppressions, and to show how very idle they were, and how very undignified, {{in the face of a}} small and compact population, where everybody sees and hears, where everybody knows, and talks, and laughs. But only a personal question remained, which I judged of no interest to the public. The essential was accomplished. Baron Senfft was gone already. Mr. Cedercrantz still lingered among us in the character (I may say) of a private citizen, his Court at last closed, only his pocket open for the receipt of his salary, representing the dignity of the Berlin Act by sitting in the wind on Mulinuu Point for several consecutive months--a curious phantom or survival of a past age. The new officials were not as yet, because they had not been created. And we fell into our old estate of government by the three Consuls, as it was in the beginning before the Berlin Act existed; as it seems it will be till the end, after the Berlin Act has been swept away.|$|E
6000|$|Some pompous {{and every}} way {{improper}} persons, of course, get {{in power in}} hospitals, and have full swing over the helpless soldiers. There is great state kept at Judiciary-square hospital, for instance. An individual who probably has been waiter somewhere for years past has got into the high and mighty position of sergeant-of-arms at this hospital; he is called [...] "Red Stripe" [...] (from his artillery trimmings) by the patients, of whom {{he is at the}} same time the tyrant and the laughing-stock. Going in to call on some sick New York soldiers here the other afternoon, I was stopped and treated to a specimen of the airs of this powerful officer. Surely the Government would do better to send such able-bodied loafers down into service in front, where they could earn their rations, than keep them here in the idle and shallow sinecures of military guard over a collection of sick soldiers to give insolence to their visitors and friends. I found a shallow old person also here named Dr. Hall, who told me he had been eighteen years in the service. I must give this Judiciary establishment the credit, from my visits to it, of saying that while in all the other hospitals I met with general cordiality and deference among the doctors, ward officers, nurses, etc., I have found more impudence and more dandy doctorism and more needless airs at this Judiciary, than in all the twoscore other establishments in and around Washington. But the corps of management at the Judiciary has a bad name anyhow, and I only specify it here to put on record the general opinion, and in hopes it may help in calling the attention of the Government to a remedy. For this hospital is half filled with New York soldiers, many noble fellows, and many sad and interesting cases. Of course there are exceptions of good <b>officials</b> <b>here,</b> and some of the women nurses are excellent, but the Empire State has no reason to be over-satisfied with this hospital.|$|E

According to one of the <b>officials</b> <b>here,</b> the state asked the designer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. what she would do over again given the chance to redesign the memorial. She said that, without an educational center explaining the war and turmoil in the country at that time, a memorial could be meaningless to passerby. This is the rationale for the existence of the facility. In 2010, the Vietnam Era Educational Center was changed to the Vietnam Era Museum & Educational Center.|$|E

5000|$|MailOnline made an {{exclusive}} report on January 14 about alleged children rights violations in Manila {{in relation to}} preparations for the papal visit. Philippine police authorities {{were reported to have}} rounded up street children, some as young as five years old, around Metro Manila and sent them to detention centers alongside adults. Detained children were reported to be treated poorly, suffering from physical and sexual abuse, starvation, denied an education and denied basic human dignity. Children who attempted to escape were reportedly chained to pillars if caught. Officials through Pasay City Social Welfare Department chief, Rosalinda Orobia, in response to an inquiry by Manila Standard, asserts that they are rounding up street children to protect the pope from street children gangs. Orabia also said that such actions were done to prevent the gangs from taking advantage of the pope. Manila Standard criticized Orobia's statement claiming that the authorities were more concerned with making the city presentable to the pope on his visit. Father Shay Cullen who works with street children commented: [...] "Sadly, there is no way the pope will be visiting these detention centers in Manila. They are a shame on the nation. <b>Officials</b> <b>here</b> would be horrified at the prospect of the Pope seeing children treated in this way".|$|E
