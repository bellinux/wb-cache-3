5|$|Sources {{from the}} time of the March 1605 {{conclave}} listed up to twenty-one possible candidates considered by the cardinals, but the only <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> seriously discussed during the conclave were Cesare Baronius and Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici. That conclave saw Spain veto Cesare Baronius after the first ballot. Medici, the candidate who was finally elected, was also vetoed by the cardinal representing Spain but this occurred after the election of Leo XI, and the cardinals did not view the veto as valid.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater was {{selected}} as the first town in the South West, outside Bristol, to be selected for the UK government's Building Schools for the Future (BSF) initiative, which aimed to rebuild and renew nearly every secondary school in England. Within Bridgwater, BSF was to redevelop all of the four secondary schools and two special provision schools at an expected cost of around £100 million. This included the complete relocation and rebuilding of a new school combining the both Haygrove and Penrose School. In July 2010, several components of the Bridgwater BSF programme were cancelled and others were singled out for further review. Following a meeting with Education Secretary Michael Gove, Bridgwater MP Ian Liddell-Granger announced that the fate of all six affected schools would be subject to review, including the <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} time of the {{conclave}} listed up to twenty-one possible candidates considered by the cardinals, but the only <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> seriously discussed during the conclave were Cesare Baronius and Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici. Baronius was the favourite candidate. His odds of being elected were 10:100 according to Roman bookmakers, who took bets on the election despite prohibition of the practice by Gregory XIV. Baronius received 23 votes during the first scrutiny, which was considered good because many electors who supported him had cast their first ballots for friends. Baronius was the candidate favoured by France, and had the backing of the French cardinals. He was also the first choice candidate of Pietro Aldobrandini, the nephew of Clement VIII, who sought to elect a cardinal who was created by his uncle such as Baronius.|$|E

5|$|The peak of sutra copying {{occurred}} in the Nara period at which time the Great Perfection of Wisdom (Daihannya) sutra and the Lotus Sutra were the sutras most often copied. Most of the sutras were written in black ink on paper dyed pale yellow. However, some were made with gold or silver ink on indigo, purple or other colored paper—particularly the <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> produced in 741 when Emperor Shōmu decreed Konkōmyō Saishōō sutras written in gold letters be distributed among provincial temples. Many sutra copies contain a colophon {{with the name of}} the sponsor—often somebody from the ruling class—and the reason of copying, usually related to the health or salvation of people or the state.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s Rhino Records {{issued a}} series of boxed sets of 78rpm reissues of early rock and roll hits, {{intended}} for owners of vintage jukeboxes.

25|$|Although {{the exact}} date of when {{production}} started is unknown, {{it appears that}} a total of 18 SDVs were produced, the last ones being built in 1994 for the Croatian Navy. In service with the Yugoslav Navy (JRM) the Malas were operated by the naval special forces of 82nd Naval Center. An unknown number of vehicles were exported to Sweden and possibly Syria. With {{the start of the}} Croatian War of Independence the majority of Yugoslav Navy's inventory was relocated to Montenegro, including the R-2 Malas. Although Conways's All of the World's Fighting Ships 1947-1995 reported that two vehicles were captured by Croatia in 1992, {{it is possible that the}} two SDVs still in use by Croatia are in fact new <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> built in 1994 after the start of the war.|$|E

25|$|Behavioral {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} that sharks can take visual cues in order to discriminate between different objects. The bull shark is able to discriminate between colors of mesh netting that is present underwater. It was found that bull sharks tended to avoid mesh netting of bright colors rather than colors that blended in with the water. Bright yellow mesh netting {{was found to be}} easily avoided when it was placed {{in the path of the}} bull shark. This was found to be the reason that sharks are attracted to bright yellow survival gear rather than <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> painted black. This is very important because it gives an insight into how bull sharks are able to pick up certain visual keys underwater that might give them an advantage when seeking out certain prey.|$|E
25|$|The TSPC {{had also}} planned to realign {{the road at}} Lake Mohansic and replace the grade {{intersection}} with an interchange. In 1962, while the commission was finishing the northern section of the Taconic, the EHPA began that project. The original parkway became the northbound roadway and a new southbound one was built. The EHPA's improvements made the road safer and more efficient for the commuters who now used it, but changed {{the character of the}} road, widening it and replacing its concrete pavement with asphalt and its wooden guardrails with steel <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> allowed to rust in order to approximate the color of their predecessors. In 1964, I-84 was built through Dutchess and Putnam counties, giving the middle of the Taconic a limited-access intersecting route that made it possible to access the Danbury and Newburgh areas via the parkway.|$|E
25|$|The second painting, Red Houses, bears general {{similarity}} to landscapes by Cézanne and Braque. Both paintings are Cubist in style. However, with them Weinrich did not announce an abrupt conversion to Cubism, but rather marked a turning toward greater experimentation. In her later work {{she would not}} adopt a single style or stylistic tendency, but would produce both representative pictures and <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> entirely abstract, always showing {{a strong sense of}} the two-dimensional plane of the picture's surface. After she made these two paintings neither her subject matter nor the media she used would dramatically change. She continued to employ subjects available to her in her Provincetown studio and the surrounding area to produce still lifes, village and pastoral scenes, portraits, and abstractions in oil on canvas and board; watercolor, pastel, crayon and graphite on paper; and woodblock prints.|$|E

25|$|While its fellow Canadian {{broadcasters}} converted most {{of their}} transmitters to digital by the Canadian digital television transition deadline of August 31, 2011, CBC converted {{only about half of}} the analogue transmitters in mandatory areas to digital (15 of 28 markets with CBC Television stations, and 14 of 28 markets with Télévision de Radio-Canada stations). Due to financial difficulties reported by the corporation, the corporation published digital transition plans for none of its analogue retransmitters in mandatory markets to be converted to digital by the deadline. Under this plan, communities that receive analogue signals by rebroadcast transmitters in mandatory markets would lose their over-the-air signals as of the deadline. Rebroadcast transmitters account for 23 of the 48 CBC and Radio-Canada transmitters in mandatory markets. Mandatory markets losing both CBC and Radio-Canada over-the-air signals include London, Ontario (metropolitan area population 457,000) and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (metro area population 257,000). In both of those markets, the corporation's television transmitters are the only <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not planned to be converted to digital by the deadline.|$|E

However, luckily for him, on arrival at the Ikeja military cantonment in Lagos the mutineers were overpowered, overwhelmed and killed by loyalist troops under the command of Lt. Col. Yakubu Gowon (who later became Nigeria's Head of State). Fani-Kayode was freed by the loyalists and kept by them in a safe house until law and order was restored in the country. The coup attempt was effectively quelled by the loyalist forces and all its ringleaders were either killed or captured and detained. Out of all the key government officials and senior military figures that were attacked in their homes and that were apprehended by the mutineers and coup plotters that night, including Sir Ahmadu Bello (the Premier of the Northern Region), Sir Tafawa Balewa (the Prime Minister), Chief Okotie-Eboh (the Minister of Finance), General Maimalari (the Chief of Army Staff), Brigadier Ademulegun(Commander of the Northern Garrison) and so many others, Chief Remi Fani-Kayode, together with Sir Kashim Ibrahim (the Governor of the Northern Region) were the only <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not killed.|$|E

Only the republication of books 18 to 28 was included in the new deal. On April 1, 2015, it was announced that book 29 would be published in English by Mantikore-Verlag. But in December 2015, Cubicle 7 Entertainment announced that they had picked up the publishing rights of the entire series of Lone Wolf gamebooks, including the English version of Lone Wolf 29, only to come back on their decision the following month. On April 1, 2016, Joe Dever announced that he would published the remaining Lone Wolf's books himself with his own imprint, Holmgard Press. This included the publication of the four gamebooks that were never published before (29 to 32) and the republication of the gamebooks that were neither republished by Mongoose or Mantikore (23 to 28).|$|E
