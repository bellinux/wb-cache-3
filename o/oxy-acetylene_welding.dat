50|$|The torch {{used for}} lead burning is a small, hot, gas flame. Oxy-acetylene is most {{commonly}} used, {{as it is}} easily portable. A small size #0 nozzle is usually used, sometimes with a miniature torch body, but the torch is otherwise {{the same as that}} used for steel or copper work. A variety of fuel gases may be used, but to achieve the high temperature needed, an oxygen supply is always used. Fuel gases may be acetylene, natural gas or hydrogen. Oxy-hydrogen is considered to be the best, but is not easily portable. Oxy-natural gas is cheapest and is often used on fixed workbenches. As it is less hot, it cannot be used for some awkward positional (overhead) <b>welding.</b> <b>Oxy-acetylene</b> is the most common, as much leadwork is carried out on site and this is easily portable.|$|R

50|$|These {{limitations}} {{are the reasons}} why large high crown panels such as wings and fenders are often made in many pieces. The pieces are then welded together usually with one of two processes. TIG welding (Tungsten Inert Gas) produces less heat distortion, but produces a harder, more brittle weld that may cause problems when planishing/smoothing by hand, or in the wheeling machine. <b>Oxy-acetylene</b> <b>welding</b> joints don't have this drawback, provided {{they are allowed to}} cool to room temperature in air, but do produce more heat distortion. Panel joints may be achieved using autogenous welding - that is welding without filler rod (Oxy-acetylene or TIG processes), this is useful when finally smoothing the welding joints as it reduces the amount filing/grinding/linishing needed or almost eliminates it altogether. It also, more importantly, reduces heat distortion of the surface contour, which must be corrected on the wheel or with hammer and dolly.|$|E

The same wharf where today’s Institute of Contemporary Art is located. His staff - a tie rod for piers - was eroded by the sea into a most beautifully organic and tactile iron length.

40|$|Objective was {{to assess}} {{techniques}} for joining NZP ceramics, a new family of ceramic materials that have low coefficient of thermal expansion, low thermal conductivity, and excellent thermal-shock resistance. Initially, the authors evaluated laser-beam welding over volatile fluxing agents (ferric oxide, copper oxide, boric acid, and boron nitride). They also examined other laser, arc-welding, brazing, and cold joining techniques. The NZP materials were capable of sustaining the thermal stresses associated with these joining processes without substantial cracking. Of the volatile fluxes, only the copper oxide promoted weld fusion. Efforts to accomplish fusion by laser-beam welding over copper, titanium, stainless steel, yttrium barium copper oxide, fused silica glass, and mullite/alumina were unsuccessful. Gas-tungsten arc welding accompanied by porosity, irregularities, and cracking was achieved on copper sheet sandwiched between NZP tiles. Attempts at conventional <b>oxy-acetylene</b> <b>welding</b> and torch brazing were unproductive.

Arc-welding has the advantage over the acetylene process, where each individual operator must use his own judgement as to the proper flame, in that a squad of arc-welders can work under the direction of a single expert supervisor who accepts the responsibility of fixing the current value and of determining the proper size of welding rod to be used on any given type of work...|$|E

FSW processed by using milling machine and the welding tool material is Amutit with pin diameter is 4 mm, shoulder diameter is 18 mm, with 60 HRc in hardness. The welding parameter are rotational speed 630 rpm, tool offset is 1. 5 mm, preheat offset is 20 mm, the welding speed were varied in 25 mm/minute, 32 mm/minute and 40 mm/minute with depth of plunge is 2. 95 mm. The result shows that highest tensile strength (108. 96 MPa) occurs on welding speed 25 mm/min, highest face bending strength (205. 79 Mpa) occurs on welding speed 32 mm, highest root bending strength (253. 51 Mpa) occurs on welding speed 25 mm.

A mailed survey was used to collect data for the study. The survey return rate for the vocational agriculture instructors was 100 percent, the return rate for the farm operators was 89 percent and the return rate for the managers of mechanics related agribusinesses was 69 percent. A scale of 1 - 4 was used by the respondents to evaluate the 47 agricultural mechanics units of instruction on the questionnaire.
