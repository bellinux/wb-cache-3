The surrealist poetry he composed beginning in 1931 displayed greater originality, garnering him strong praise and acclaim.

He suffered a series of personal and professional disappointments, including {{the death of his}} daughter, the French authorities' decision to exclude him from the list of exhibitors at the Universal Exposition in Paris, and growing debt worsened by his philandering and <b>opium</b> <b>addiction.</b> Following Rabearivelo's suicide by cyanide poisoning in 1937, he became viewed as a colonial martyr.|$|E
5|$|Still 200 {{miles from}} the Afghan border, the {{expedition}} now had to race against time. Ahead were British patrols of the East Persia Cordon (later known as the Seistan Force) and Russian patrols. By September, the German codebook lost by Wassmuss had been deciphered, which further compromised the situation. Niedermayer, now in charge, {{proved to be a}} brilliant tactician. He sent three feint patrols, one to north-east to draw away the Russian troops and one to the south-east to draw away the British, while a third patrol of thirty armed Persians, led by a German officer—Lieutenant Wagner—was sent ahead to scout the route. After leading the Russians astray, the first group was to remain in Persia to establish a secret desert base as a refuge for the main party. After luring away the British, the second group was to fall back to Kermanshah and link with a separate German force under Lieutenants Zugmayer and Griesinger. All three parties were ordered to spread misleading information about their movements to any nomads or villagers they met. Meanwhile, the main body headed through Chehar Deh for the region of Birjand, close to the Afghan frontier. The party covered forty miles before it reached the next village, where Niedermayer halted to await word from Wagner's patrol. The villagers were meanwhile barred from leaving. The report from Wagner was bad: His patrol had run into a Russian ambush and the desert refuge had been eliminated. The expedition proceeded towards Birjand using forced marches to keep a day ahead of the British and Russian patrols. Other problems still confronted Niedermayer, among them the <b>opium</b> <b>addiction</b> of his Persian camel drivers. Fearful of being spotted, he had to stop the Persians a number of times from lighting up their pipes. Men who fell behind were abandoned. Some of the Persian drivers attempted to defect. On one occasion, a driver was shot while he attempted to flee and betray the group.|$|E
25|$|His writing focus, {{as well as}} {{the focus}} of his life, turned to the problem of <b>opium</b> <b>addiction.</b> He {{described}} this as “one of my life’s ruling passions — a very agony of seeking to find — any means of bringing the habituated opium-eater out of his horrible bondage, without, or comparatively without, pain.” His essay What Shall They Do to be Saved from Harper’s was included in the 1868 book (written by Horace Day, himself a recovering addict) The Opium Habit, one of the first books to deal in a medical way with <b>opium</b> <b>addiction,</b> which had become a national crisis {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Ludlow expanded on his original essay with Outlines of the Opium Cure, a portrait in words of an ideal, perhaps utopian, drug addiction treatment clinic.|$|E

50|$|Professor Nils Bejerot {{argued that}} Lindesmith made wrong {{conclusions}} about {{what caused the}} low abuse of opium in the late 1940s in England.

Bejerot - who was very familiar with the discussion about drug policy in the UK and had studied epidemiology and medical statistics at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in 1963 - drew the opposite conclusion. The low abuse of drugs in England until the 1950s was the cause for the liberal drug laws in England. When the number of addicts of heroin in England doubled every sixteenth month from 1959 to 1968 became the British government forced to implement more restrictive drug laws.|$|R
25|$|He campaigned {{against the}} opium trade, and in 1883 went on an {{investigation}} to the Chinese camps in Southern New South Wales.

25|$|The poem also captures some {{feelings}} in Coleridge's previous works, especially in analyzing a problematic childhood and {{an exploration of}} religion. Partly, these feelings were fueled by his inability to accept his <b>opium</b> <b>addiction</b> and other problems. The poems also contain Coleridge's desires for Hutchinson, but these were later removed from the printed edition of the works. The editions are so different that they reflect the conflict and division that Coleridge felt during 1802. The tone of the poems are different, as the original was passionate and emotional, and the printed version was organized and philosophical.|$|E

Liggins and Williams realized that of the roughly 20 missionaries sent during the previous decade, half had left before their own arrival, due to fevers (Shanghai being in the delta of the Yangtze River and surrounded by rice fields), and rough conditions. The countryside was ambiguous about foreigners, and smarting from the defeat in the First Opium War. Many were curious about Western ways, but slavery, gambling, alcoholism and <b>opium</b> <b>addiction</b> had also become problems that some Western merchants fostered (especially near Canton). The Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864) had begun and in 1853 captured Nanjing only 200 miles from Shanghai. Its leader proclaimed himself as the younger brother of Jesus Christ and fought the ruling Manchus (whom he portrayed as devils), and also preached about the equality of women, communal ownership and revitalized ethics.|$|E

5000|$|Aside {{from the}} obvious threat of <b>addiction,</b> <b>opium</b> {{production}} {{is changing the}} dynamic of many Afghan villages.

This newfound wealth for the young men of Afghanistan is troubling {{to many of the}} village leaders as before they were revered for their wisdom, and now are given little if any respect. It has also been noted that relationships among fathers and sons, neighbours, and family in general, are drastically changing as leadership roles in the economy continue to shift. As the young men have increased contact with the outer world, they have become aware of different methods of performing traditional tasks, which have created tensions between the young men and thewhite beards. Also, there has been a shift from the level of co-operation, trust, and reciprocity within villages to a move of self-interest, all of which have been adversely affected by the war.|$|R
25|$|Shortly after {{acquiring}} Taiwan in 1895, then Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi {{ordered that}} opium {{should be banned}} in Taiwan as soon as possible. However, due to the pervasiveness of <b>opium</b> <b>addiction</b> in Taiwanese society at the time, and {{the social and economic}} problems caused by complete prohibition, the initial hard line policy was relaxed in a few years. On January 21, 1897, the Colonial Government issued the Taiwan Opium Edict mandating a government monopoly of the opium trade, and restricting the sale of opium to those with government issued permits, with the ultimate goal of total abolition. The number of opium addicts in Taiwan quickly dropped from millions to 169,064 in 1900 (6.3% of the total population at the time), to 45,832 (1.3% of the population) by 1921. However, the numbers were still higher than those in nations where opium was completely prohibited. It was generally believed that one important factor behind the Colonial Government's reluctance to completely ban opium was the potential profit to be made through a state run narcotics monopoly.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{disagreement}} over Cocteau's reaction to Radiguet's sudden death in 1923, with some claiming that it left him stunned, despondent and prey to <b>opium</b> <b>addiction.</b> Opponents of that interpretation {{point out that}} he did not attend the funeral (he generally did not attend funerals) and immediately left Paris with Diaghilev for a performance of Les noces (The Wedding) by the Ballets Russes at Monte Carlo. Cocteau himself much later characterised his reaction as one of [...] "stupor and disgust." [...] His <b>opium</b> <b>addiction</b> at the time, Cocteau said, was only coincidental, due to a chance meeting with Louis Laloy, the administrator of the Monte Carlo Opera. Cocteau's opium use and his efforts to stop profoundly changed his literary style. His most notable book, Les Enfants Terribles, was written in a week during a strenuous opium weaning. In , he recounts the experience of his recovery from <b>opium</b> <b>addiction</b> in 1929. His account, which includes vivid pen-and-ink illustrations, alternates between his moment-to-moment experiences of drug withdrawal and his current thoughts about people and events in his world. Cocteau was supported throughout his recovery by his friend and correspondent, Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain. Under Maritain's influence Cocteau made a temporary return to the sacraments of the Catholic Church. He again returned to the Church later in life and undertook a number of religious art projects.|$|E
5000|$|Yet {{from the}} time of its publication, De Quincey's Confessions was criticized for {{presenting}} a picture of the opium experience that was too positive and too enticing to readers. As early as 1823, an anonymous response, Advice to Opium Eaters, was published [...] "to warn others from copying De Quincey." [...] The fear of reckless imitation was not groundless: several English writers — Francis Thompson, James Thomson, William Blair, and perhaps Branwell Brontë — were led to <b>opium</b> use and <b>addiction</b> by De Quincey's literary example. Charles Baudelaire's 1860 translation and adaptation, Les paradis artificiels, spread the work's influence further. One of the characters of the Sherlock Holmes story, The Man with the Twisted Lip (1891), is an opium addict who began experimenting with the drug as a student after reading the Confessions. De Quincey attempted to address this type of criticism. When the 1821 original was printed in book form the following year, he added an Appendix on the withdrawal process; and he inserted significant material on the medical aspects of opium into his 1856 revision.|$|R
500|$|In chapter seven Townsend {{details the}} sheer horror of China's ongoing civil war.

With every man only out for himself and [...] "China's microscopically few good men... too weak to be felt", Townsend predicts {{no end to the}} chaos. Much of the violence, Townsend explains in chapter eight, is fuelled by <b>opium,</b> the <b>addiction</b> of one out of every eight Chinese. Peasants are often compelled to plant opium by local administrators and warlords to pay for their armies, {{to such an extent that}} many districts are more heavily planted with opium than food, and all the while KMT officials lie incessantly to the international community about their efforts to suppress the trade. In contrast to the depredations of the KMT and other warlords, in chapter nine Townsend praises the positive influence of the Japanese in China. The Japanese themselves are considered by him to be a loyal, brave, reliable, honest, and cleanly people, and thus the polar opposites of the Chinese. Townsend provides his own firsthand account of the Shanghai Incident of 1932, which he claims was probably provoked by Chinese aggression, and similarly sees the Japanese decision to invade Manchuria as a fitting response to the [...] "foredoomed contest of covert violence against the Japanese" [...] waged by Zhang Xueliang. Townsend also lavishes praise on the puppet state of Manchukuo as [...] "a blessing to the thirty million or so Chinese living there" [...] which has achieved [...] "stability and well-being for millions". Townsend concludes that informed observers are grateful for Japan's role in dealing with an unruly China.|$|R
