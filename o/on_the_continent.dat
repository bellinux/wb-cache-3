5|$|Several governments {{maintain}} permanent manned research stations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent.</b> The {{number of}} people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> and its nearby islands varies from about 1,000 in winter to about 5,000 in the summer, giving it a population density between 70 and 350 inhabitants per million square kilometres (180 and 900 per million square miles) at these times. Many of the stations are staffed year-round, the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment. An Orthodox church—Trinity Church, opened in 2004 at the Russian Bellingshausen Station—is manned year-round by one or two priests, who are similarly rotated every year.|$|E

5|$|Honorius {{consolidated}} {{the work}} of converting the English by sending Felix, a Burgundian, to Dunwich after Felix came to the archbishop and made known his desire to go to East Anglia as a missionary.

It is possible that King Sigeberht of East Anglia, who converted to Christianity {{while he was in}} exile <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent,</b> had already met Felix and was behind Felix's journey to Honorius. As well as his help to Felix, Honorius consecrated the first Anglo-Saxon bishop, Ithamar of Rochester, and his successor was also a native of England.|$|E

5|$|In the War of the Third Coalition, 1803–1806, an {{alliance}} of Austria, Portugal, Russia, and others fought the First French Empire and its client states.

In the Ulm campaign, Klenau's force achieved the single Austrian victory prior to the surrender of the Austrian army in Swabia. In the second determining event, the decisive French victory at the Battle of Austerlitz over the combined Russian and Austrian force forced a final capitulation of the Austrian forces and took the Habsburgs out of the Coalition. This did not establish a lasting peace <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>continent.</b> Prussian worries about growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806, in which Austria did not participate.|$|E
