40|$|IntroductionOnline {{retail trade}} is a current topic of {{discussion}} within the Australian community. Interest centres on the size and growth of <b>online</b> <b>retail</b> trade {{as well as its}} performance relative to traditional store-based retail trade. This information paper explains where <b>online</b> <b>retail</b> trade activity is currently included in ABS macroeconomic statistics and describes enhancements to improve measurement and coverage of <b>online</b> <b>retail</b> trade activity in both retail trade statistics and the wider macroeconomic accounts. Defining <b>online</b> <b>retail</b> tradeThe Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) defines ‘retail trade’ as “the purchase and onselling, commission-based buying, and commission-based selling of goods, without significant transformation, to the general public”. This broad definition includes the sale of goods to the general public using non-traditional means, including the internet. <b>Online</b> <b>retail</b> trade may be defined according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition of e-commerce. Using this definition, an electronic transaction is the sale of goods and/or services which are ordered via the Internet or any other computer-mediated network. This applies regardless of whether the payment and/or the ultimate delivery of the goods and/or services is conducted online or offline. Therefore, all retail trade activity where the commitment to purchase is made online may be considered to be <b>online</b> <b>retail</b> trade activity, irrespective of the method of payment and/or delivery used. Other descriptions of <b>online</b> <b>retail</b> trade have also emerged to distinguish between different forms of <b>online</b> <b>retail</b> trade. Retailers who trade with consumers solely via an online store, and have no physical store, are commonly referred to as ‘pure-play’ online retailers. Similarly, retailers who combine a physical store with other non-traditional means such as catalogues, mail-order, telephone-order and/or an online store, are commonly referred to as ‘multi-channel’ retailers.  ...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{incentives}} for incumbent bricks-and-mortar firms and new entrants {{to start an}} <b>online</b> <b>retail</b> channel in a differentiated goods market. To this end {{we set up a}} two-stage model where firms first {{decide whether or not to}} build the infrastructure necessary to start an <b>online</b> <b>retail</b> channel and then compete in prices using the channels they have opened up. Consumers trade-off the convenience of online shopping and the ease to compare prices, with online uncertainties. Without a threat of entry by a third pure online player we find that for most parameter constellations firms' dominant strategy is not to open an <b>online</b> <b>retail</b> channel as this cannibalizes too much on their conventional sales. As the cannibalization effect is not present for a pure Internet player, we show that these firms will start <b>online</b> <b>retail</b> channels under a much wider range of parameter constellations. The threat of entry may force incumbent bricks-and-mortar firms to deter entry by starting up an Internet retail channel themselves. We also show that a low cost of building up an <b>online</b> <b>retail</b> channel or <b>online</b> shopping conveniences may not be to the benefit of online shopping as the strategic interaction between firms may be such that no <b>online</b> <b>retail</b> channel is built when the circumstances seem to be more favourable...|$|R
