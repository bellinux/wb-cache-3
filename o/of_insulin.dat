5|$|Some {{guidelines}} {{recommend a}} bolus (initial large dose) <b>of</b> <b>insulin</b> of 0.1unit <b>of</b> <b>insulin</b> per kilogram of body weight. This can be administered {{immediately after the}} potassium level {{is known to be}} higher than 3.3mmol/l; if the level is any lower, administering insulin could lead to a dangerously low potassium level (see below).

5|$|In general, insulin {{is given}} at 0.1unit/kg per hour {{to reduce the}} blood sugars and {{suppress}} ketone production. Guidelines differ as to which dose to use when blood sugar levels start falling; some recommend reducing the dose <b>of</b> <b>insulin</b> once glucose falls below 16.6mmol/l (300mg/dl) but other recommend infusing glucose in addition to saline to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses <b>of</b> <b>insulin.</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction Insulin analogues {{have become}} {{increasingly}} popular despite their greater cost compared with human <b>insulin.</b> The aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} calculate the incremental cost to the National Health Service (NHS) <b>of</b> prescribing analogue <b>insulin</b> preparations instead <b>of</b> their human <b>insulin</b> alternatives. Methods Open-source data from the four UK prescription pricing agencies from 2000 to 2009 were analysed. Cost was adjusted for inflation and reported in UK pounds at 2010 prices. Results Over the 10 -year period, the NHS spent a total of £ 2732 million on insulin. The total annual cost increased from £ 156 million to £ 359 million, an increase of 130 %. The annual cost <b>of</b> analogue <b>insulin</b> increased from £ 18. 2 million (12 % <b>of</b> total <b>insulin</b> cost) to £ 305 million (85 % <b>of</b> total <b>insulin</b> cost), whereas the cost <b>of</b> human <b>insulin</b> decreased from £ 131 million (84 % <b>of</b> total <b>insulin</b> cost) to £ 51 million (14 % <b>of</b> total <b>insulin</b> cost). If it is assumed that all patients using insulin analogues could have received human insulin instead, the overall incremental cost <b>of</b> analogue <b>insulin</b> was £ 625 million. Conclusion Given the high marginal cost <b>of</b> analogue <b>insulin,</b> adherence to prescribing guidelines recommending the preferential use <b>of</b> human <b>insulin</b> would have resulted in considerable financial savings over the period...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} these {{experiments}} {{was to determine the}} relative content and biosynthetic rate <b>of</b> <b>insulins</b> I and II under various experimental conditions. The two insulins were quantitated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrotransfer to nitrocellulose paper, photoaffinity crosslinking, and immunodetection with anti-insulin antibody and 125 I-labeled protein A. The ratio (mean +/- SEM) <b>of</b> <b>insulins,</b> I/II, was 1. 2 +/- 0. 2 in Wistar-Furth rats fasted for 4 days, 1. 6 +/- 0. 2 in normal rats, and 5. 5 +/- 0. 8 in growth hormone-tumor-bearing hyperinsulinemic rats (P less than 0. 01). The increase in content <b>of</b> rat <b>insulin</b> I compared to II in the growth hormone-tumor-bearing animals was confirmed by radioimmunoassay of gel slices. To determine whether the difference in contents <b>of</b> rat <b>insulins</b> I and II in the hyperinsulinemic rats was due to increased biosynthesis or a different turnover rate, isolated rat islets were incubated in [3 H]leucine for 4 hr with 5. 5 mM or 16. 0 mM glucose in the incubation medium. Glucose stimulated insulin biosynthesis greater than 8 -fold. The ratio of synthesis <b>of</b> rat <b>insulin</b> I relative to II was 0. 9 +/- 0. 1 at 5. 5 mM glucose and 9. 8 +/- 3. 3 (P less than 0. 01) at 16. 0 mM glucose. Therefore, under conditions that stimulate insulin biosynthesis, there was a marked preferential synthesis <b>of</b> rat <b>insulin</b> I relative to II. These studies suggest that the two rat insulin genes are expressed independently and that, under stimulatory conditions, there is preferential expression <b>of</b> the rat <b>insulin</b> I gene...|$|R
5|$|In {{people with}} {{suspected}} ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, determination of antibodies against {{glutamic acid decarboxylase}} and islet cells may aid in the decision whether to continue insulin administration long-term (if antibodies are detected), or whether to withdraw insulin and attempt treatment with oral medication as in type 2 diabetes. Generally speaking, routine measurement of C-peptide as a measure <b>of</b> <b>insulin</b> production is not recommended unless there is genuine doubt as to whether someone has type 1 or type 2 diabetes.|$|E

5|$|Rates of DKA {{vary around}} the world. In the United Kingdom, about 4% {{of people with}} type 1 {{diabetes}} develop DKA each year, while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year. DKA was first described in 1886 and, until the introduction <b>of</b> <b>insulin</b> therapy in the 1920s, it was almost universally fatal. The risk of death with adequate and timely treatment is currently around 1–4%. Up to 1% of children with DKA develop a complication known as cerebral edema.|$|E
40|$|The classic {{understanding}} <b>of</b> the <b>insulin</b> secretion defect and the {{insulin resistance}} in the type 2 diabetes has been completed by the findings about {{the important role of}} hyperglycemia in additional damaging <b>of</b> the <b>insulin</b> secretion function and strengthening post-receptor defects in the insulin activity - this effect is known as glucose toxicity. On the basis of these findings an interest appeared in applying short insulin therapy in the type 2 diabetes whose aim is the correction of glycemia and elimination of the glucose toxicity effects. The examination comprised 35 patients of type 2 diabetes who were subdued, for four weeks, to diverse regimes <b>of</b> the <b>insulin</b> therapy. The results clearly show that the insulin therapy does not only lead to the correction of glycemia but also to the correction <b>of</b> the <b>insulin</b> secretion function and reduction <b>of</b> the <b>insulin</b> resistance with these patients.
