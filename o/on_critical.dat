5|$|First {{to arrive}} was Otto Frisch and Ernest Titterton {{and his wife}} Peggy, who reached Los Alamos on 13 December 1943. At Los Alamos Frisch {{continued}} his work <b>on</b> <b>critical</b> mass studies, for which Titterton developed electronic circuitry for high voltage generators, X-ray generators, timers and firing circuits. Peggy Titterton, a trained physics and metallurgy laboratory assistant, {{was one of the}} few women working at Los Alamos in a technical role. Chadwick arrived on 12 January 1944, but only stayed for a few months before returning to Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, Metacritic editor Jason Dietz {{undertook}} a {{statistical analysis of}} whether films released in that month were, as perceived, inferior. He compared the site's aggregate scores, based <b>on</b> <b>critical</b> and audience consensus, for films released in January, February, and March from 2000 to 2009. January averaged the fewest releases of the three, and the lowest average scores. Of the 88 films released {{in the first month}} of the year during that decade, only six earned above a 61 average on the site's scale of 0 to 100, the lowest of any of the three winter months, even accounting for the increase in releases as the spring becomes closer.|$|E

In the disjunctive graph, the longest {{path in the}} disjunctive graph is the critical path and the critical operations are these operations <b>on</b> the <b>critical</b> path. The maximal sequence of joint public critical operations (which are belong to all the <b>critical</b> paths) processed <b>on</b> the same machine is defined as public critical block. Only changing the critical paths can reduce the makespan and neighborhoods based <b>on</b> public <b>critical</b> block theory can significantly reduce the search scope. Therefore, three neighborhood structures based <b>on</b> public <b>critical</b> block are defined in variable neighborhood search.

5|$|Volcanic {{ash fall}} events can disrupt and or damage the {{infrastructure}} upon which society depends. Several recent eruptions have illustrated {{the vulnerability of}} urban areas that received only a few millimetres or centimetres of volcanic ash. This has been sufficient to cause disruption of transportation, electricity, water, sewage and storm water systems. Costs have been incurred from business disruption, replacement of damaged parts and insured losses. Ash fall impacts <b>on</b> <b>critical</b> infrastructure can also cause multiple knock-on effects, which may disrupt many different sectors and services.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine {{was that of}} a crisis, a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur <b>on</b> <b>critical</b> days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1538, {{shortly before}} the Catholic Duke Georg of Saxony died, a {{religious}} colloquy was convened in Leipzig to discuss potential reforms within the Duchy. The Electorate of Saxony sent Melanchthon, and Philip of Hesse sent Bucer. The Duchy itself was represented by Georg Witzel, a former Lutheran who had reconverted to Catholicism. In discussions from 2 to 7 January 1539, Bucer and Witzel agreed to defer controversial points of doctrine, but Melanchthon withdrew, feeling that doctrinal unity was a prerequisite of a reform plan. Bucer and Witzel agreed on fifteen articles covering various issues of church life. Bucer, however, made no doctrinal concessions: he remained silent <b>on</b> <b>critical</b> matters such as the mass and the papacy. His ecumenical approach provoked harsh criticism from other reformers.|$|E
