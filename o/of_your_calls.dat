6000|$|... "Heart-of-oak. From the {{peculiar}} time <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>call</b> upon me, I suppose you purposely select stormy weather for your journeys. When the thunder is roaring, you deem it an hour peculiarly favorable for producing impressions favorable to your trade." ...|$|R

But I happened to ask him to what class men <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>calling</b> usually belonged; and he said that they were laborers, butchers, and so forth. Do you resent that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{should have}} waited at home to-day {{on the chance}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>calling,</b> but that I went over to look after Lemon; and I went for this reason: the surgeon opines {{that there is no}} {{possibility}} of Mrs. Dickens being able to play, although she is going on [...] "as well as possible," [...] which I sincerely believe.|$|R
6000|$|I was {{a little}} scandalized at the idea <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>calling</b> the book [...] "word-painting."

You will understand, sir, I hope, since {{you seem to}} be a gentleman and a man of some spirit in spite <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>calling,</b> that if we should have the misfortune to hang you, we shall do so as a mere matter of political necessity and military duty, without any personal ill-feeling.|$|R

5000|$|And, [...] "If God {{show you}} {{a way in which}} you may {{lawfully}} get more than in another way (without wrong to your soul or to any other), if you refuse this, and choose the less gainful way, you cross one of the ends <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>calling,</b> and you refuse to be God's steward, and to accept His gifts and use them for him when He requireth it: you may labour to be rich for God, though not for the flesh and sin" [...] (p. 108).|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{says that}} the New England {{standard}} of excellence as applied to woman has been a mistaken one; and, in consequence, though the girls are beautiful, the matrons are faded, overworked, and uninteresting; and that such a state of society tends to immorality, because, when wives are no longer charming, men {{are open to the}} temptation to desert their firesides, and get into mischief generally. He seems particularly to complain <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>calling</b> ladies who do nothing the 'fascinating lazzaroni of the parlor and boudoir.'" ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1892, Blanche, then twenty-six, {{began an}} {{intimate}} friendship with fifty-one-year-old writer Ambrose Bierce. Blanche {{became one of}} the famed humorist's favored correspondents, a position she still retained {{at the time of his}} mysterious disappearance in 1914. It is generally assumed among Bierce scholars that the two were lovers, but it is clear from Bierce's early letters, during the summer of 1892, that Blanche looked to Bierce for instruction about a possible career in journalism. [...] "When you are quite sure of the nature <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>call</b> to write--quite sure that it is not the voice of 'duty'--then let me do you such slight, poor service as my limitations and the injunctions of circumstance permit." ...|$|R
60|$|I cannot forbear {{warning you}} in the most earnest manner against endeavouring at wit in your sermons, because by the strictest computation, it is very near a million to one that you have none; and because too many <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>calling</b> have {{consequently}} made themselves everlastingly ridiculous by attempting it. I remember several young men in this town, who could never leave the pulpit under half a dozen conceits; and this faculty adhered to those gentlemen a longer or shorter time exactly in proportion to their several degrees of dulness: accordingly, I am told {{that some of them}} retain it to this day.

"Just {{by way of}} review, here is how to know if an idea is from God:One, is {{it within}} the bounds and {{limitations}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>calling,</b> and does it require a service consistent with your calling?Two, is it consistent with the revealed word of God? The scriptures and the directions of the living prophet of God today--those are the revealed words of God.Three, is the receiver of the communication a fit receptacle? Is he in condition to receive such a communication from the Lord?Four, does the communication edify and cause you to rejoice?Five, does it cause your bosom to burn or speak peace to your soul, or are you left troubled by the communication?Six, is the communication vivid to the understanding, or does it leave a cloud or a hazy impression?" ...|$|R

You have a face to be {{remember}}ed, and I remember faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the nature <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>calling.</b> And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad." ...|$|R
