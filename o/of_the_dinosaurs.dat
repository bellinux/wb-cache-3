5|$|Roger Stevens {{was working}} for the BBC as a film editor in the 1980s, and one morning, as he was {{travelling}} to work by train, he bumped into a BBC co-worker and they began to talk about Doctor Who episodes. The BBC projectionist mentioned that he had nine episodes of Doctor Who that Stevens could buy for £25. In the summer of 1981, Stevens bought The Space Museum episode one, The Abominable Snowmen episode two, The Moonbase episode four, Invasion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaurs</b> episode one, and three episodes of Carnival of Monsters. Stevens then contacted Ian Levine {{to find out what was}} missing from the BBC archive; Levine confirmed that The Abominable Snowmen episode two and Invasion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaurs</b> episode one were currently missing.|$|E

40|$|Notes {{from the}} Anthropocene is an {{experimental}} essay film that explores <b>the</b> cultural imagination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur</b> as a souvenir for 21 st century humans. <b>The</b> icon <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur</b> shifts between narratives of extinction and human exceptionalism and power. <b>The</b> materiality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur</b> whether fossil or plastic toy has, through popular culture, become entrenched in <b>the</b> imaginary <b>of</b> oil extraction and fossil fuel production. Notes from the Anthropocene is a speculative iconological look at <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur,</b> and its resurrection in the Anthropocene, the proposed geological era where humans are the dominating {{force on the}} planet, and its symbolic relationship to an increasing ambivalence towards the natural world...|$|R

5|$|Stevens gave these prints to Levine, who {{returned}} The Abominable Snowmen to the BBC in February 1982, although he held back Invasion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaurs</b> from the BBC for a while. This was later {{returned to the}} BBC by Levine in June 1983, who then made a copy and returned the original to Levine.|$|E
5|$|For four years, Episode 1 of Invasion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaurs</b> was {{the only}} Pertwee episode to be entirely missing from the archives, until a {{black-and-white}} 16mm copy was returned to the Corporation in June 1983. The story was released on DVD with a partially recolourised version of Episode 1, alongside a higher-quality monochrome transfer of the episode, in The UNIT Files box set. With one exception, archival holdings from Death to the Daleks Episode 2 onwards are complete on the original broadcast videotapes.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{are often}} used in atomic clocks. Caesium atomic clocks are {{extraordinarily}} accurate; if a clock had been made at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs,</b> it would be off by less than four seconds (after 80 million years). For that reason, caesium atoms are used as {{the definition of the}} second. Rubidium ions {{are often used}} in purple fireworks, and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, chroma dots {{were used}} to restore the colour to Episodes 2–4, 6, and 7 of The Ambassadors of Death and episodes 2–6 of The Mind of Evil. Episode 1 of Invasion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaurs</b> {{presented}} a unique challenge, in that the chroma dots only contained red and green colour filter information, requiring that the blue filter to be added manually. Given the rough result, the DVD includes both the reconstructed colour and the black-and-white version.|$|E
5|$|The {{extinction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> {{at the end}} of the Cretaceous {{period is}} generally thought to have been caused by the Cretaceous–Paleogene impact event, which created the Chicxulub crater, demonstrating that impacts are a serious threat to life on Earth. Astronomers have speculated that without Jupiter to mop up potential impactors, extinction events might have been more frequent on Earth, and complex life might not have been able to develop. This is part of the argument used in the Rare Earth hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{group is}} then joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim Murphy, {{for a tour}} of the park, while Hammond oversees the trip from the park's control room. The tour does not go as planned, with most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> failing to appear and the group encountering a sick Triceratops. The tour is cut short as a {{tropical}} storm approaches Isla Nublar. Most of the park employees evacuate on a boat to the mainland while the visitors return to their electric tour vehicles, except Ellie who stays with the park's veterinarian to study the Triceratops.|$|E

5|$|The {{locality}} where Batrachotomus lived was a swampy {{region and}} the name comes from the Greek batrachos/βάτραχος (frog) and tome/τομή (cutting, slicing), which refers to its preying on the large amphibian Mastodonsaurus. In contrast with sprawling reptiles, like crocodiles, this large carnivore was very agile with locomotor superiority due to its erect stance. A remarkable feature seen on its back was a row of paired, flattened bony plates. Batrachotomus was possibly an early relative of Postosuchus, which lived during the dawn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Therian mammals {{took over}} the medium- to large-sized {{ecological}} niches in the Cenozoic, after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago emptied ecological space once filled by non-avian dinosaurs and other groups of reptiles, as well as various other mammal groups, and underwent an exponential increase in body size (megafauna). Then mammals diversified very quickly; both birds and mammals show an exponential rise in diversity. For example, the earliest known bat dates from about 50 million years ago, only 16 million years after the extinction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs.</b>|$|E
5|$|All stories {{starring}} Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor are complete, {{though many}} episodes no longer survive on their original videotapes and were only available from black-and-white overseas prints upon recovery; these episodes have subsequently been restored to colour {{using a variety}} of methods. In order of original transmissions, the very last Doctor Who master videotapes to be wiped were the first episodes of the 1974 serials Invasion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaurs</b> and Death to the Daleks. The latter was recovered from overseas, initially from a tape in the NTSC format, and later in the original PAL format on a tape returned from Dubai.|$|E

5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up {{on its hind legs}} to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, in a way it resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1849, a {{few years}} before his death in 1852, Mantell {{realised}} that iguanodonts were not heavy, pachyderm-like animals, as Owen was putting forward, but had slender forelimbs; however, his passing left him unable to participate {{in the creation of the}} Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, and so Owen's vision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> became that seen by the public for decades. With Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, he had nearly two dozen lifesize sculptures of various prehistoric animals built out of concrete sculpted over a steel and brick framework; two iguanodonts (based on the Mantellodon specimen), one standing and one resting on its belly, were included. Before the sculpture of the standing iguanodont was completed, he held a banquet for twenty inside it.|$|E
5|$|Many Macroolithus {{specimens}} in South China have {{double- or}} multiple-layering of cones {{on the inner}} surface of the eggshell, a pathological condition known as ovum in ovo. It is especially prevalent among eggs nearest to the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary, which represents {{the end of the}} Mesozoic Era. This pathology is correlated with a higher concentration of trace elements like Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn. Experiments on modern birds have demonstrated that exposure to high levels of these elements will cause them to be incorporated into the eggshell, but the precise mechanism behind the pathological multi-layering is unknown. These abnormalities presumably affected hatchability of the eggs and may {{have played a role in}} the extinction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs.</b> However, the embryonic remains inside three multilayered Macroolithus-like eggs from Ganzhou appear unaffected.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> {{two species}} <b>of</b> Corythosaurus are both present in {{slightly}} different levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dinosaur</b> Park Formation.

25|$|On October 28, 2011, <b>the</b> Museum <b>of</b> Nature & Science in Dallas {{announced}} it was naming a new species <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur</b> genus Pachyrhinosaurus after the Perot family. The new species is named Pachyrhinosaurus perotorum.|$|R
5|$|Molecular phylogenetic studies {{initially}} {{suggested that}} most placental orders diverged about 100 to 85 {{million years ago}} and that modern families appeared in the period from the late Eocene through the Miocene. However, no placental fossils have been found from {{before the end of}} the Cretaceous. The earliest undisputed fossils of placentals comes from the early Paleocene, after the extinction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs.</b> In particular, scientists have identified an early Paleocene animal named Protungulatum donnae as one of the first placental mammals. however it has been reclassified as a non-placental eutherian. Recalibrations of genetic and morphological diversity rates have suggested a Late Cretaceous origin for placentals, and a Paleocene origin for most modern clades.|$|E
5|$|Publication of the 1980 paper brought {{criticism}} from the geologic community, and an often acrimonious scientific debate ensued. Ten years later, and after Alvarez's death, evidence of a large impact crater called Chicxulub was found {{off the coast of}} Mexico, providing support for the theory. Other researchers later found that the end-Cretaceous extinction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs</b> may have occurred rapidly in geologic terms, over thousands of years, rather than millions of years as had previously been supposed. Others continue to study alternative extinction causes such as increased volcanism, particularly the massive Deccan Traps eruptions that occurred around the same time, and climate change, checking against the fossil record. However, on March 4, 2010, a panel of 41 scientists agreed that the Chicxulub asteroid impact triggered the mass extinction.|$|E
5|$|The babies {{discover}} a tiny lizard in Tommy Pickles' backyard {{that they are}} convinced is the offspring of Reptar, a fictitious green dinosaur and main character of many action movies of which the Rugrats are fond. After learning about the extinction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaurs,</b> Tommy decides to return the lizard to Reptar just as his family has purchased tickets for a musical ice show based on the character. After Tommy's parents and grandfather have fallen asleep, the babies sneak into the ice rink and present the lizard to Leo, the actor portraying Reptar, who coincidentally happens to possess a phobia of lizards. Stu Pickles, Tommy's father, sees the rugrats and must retrieve them from the ice rink.|$|E
50|$|A large phylogenetic {{analyses}} of early dinosaurs and dinosauromorphs by Matthew Baron, David Norman and Paul Barrett (2017) recovered Saltopus near <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur</b> lineage, {{suggesting that it}} may represent <b>the</b> closest relative <b>of</b> true dinosaurs.|$|R
5|$|The Lancian time {{interval}} {{was the last}} interval before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that eliminated non-avian dinosaurs. Edmontosaurus was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more common <b>dinosaurs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interval. Robert Bakker reports that it made up one-seventh <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large <b>dinosaur</b> sample, with most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest (five-sixths) made up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horned <b>dinosaur</b> Triceratops. <b>The</b> coastal plain Triceratops–Edmontosaurus association, dominated by Triceratops, extended from Colorado to Saskatchewan.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> {{function}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinosaur's</b> sail or hump is uncertain; {{scientists have}} proposed several hypotheses including heat regulation and display.
