40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{harmonic}} frequency generation {{being used to}} clock state-of-the-art sub-picosecond time interval measurement devices. The operating principle of harmonic frequency generation {{is based on the}} fact that by means of waveform shaping of the input frequency, multiples of the basic frequency are generated. The chosen waveform shape in the time domain converts to a series of frequencies in the frequency domain according to Fourier analysis. If these multiples of the basic input frequency are coupled to a resonant circuit and amplified, much of the total power of the spectrum is concentrated into a single output frequency and a harmonic frequency multiplier topology is achieved. The need for low-jitter frequency multiplication is driven by the requirement of sub-picosecond timing system precision. The developed harmonic frequency multiplier provides a low phase noise output clock signal of 200 MHz, generated out of a 10 MHz input frequency with pulses rise and fall times below 50 ps and measured phase jitter below 1 ps. All sub-harmonic frequency contents (which are multiples of 10 MHz input) were designed and verified to be suppressed by at least – 107 dBc below the <b>output</b> <b>carrier</b> fundamental of 200 MHz.

At passed time the materials of three World congresses under the theory of machines and mechanisms (Italy, Milan- 1995, China, Tianjin- 2004, France, Besancon- 2007) about effective mechanisms with differential constraints without power losses are published. In afforded work the {{torque variator}} having {{two degrees of freedom}} and differential constraint which is provided by geometrical parameters of cogwheels at absence of power losses on creation of adapting effect is considered. The variator contains input structural group with two degrees of freedom (rack, input carrier, satellite) and the joining kinematic chain with zero mobility (two blocks of the central cogwheels, output satellite, <b>output</b> <b>carrier).</b> The joining kinematic chain superimposes a differential constraint on relative motion of the input satellite. The geometrical parameters of cogwheels are such that the efforts transmitted to the input satellite by the joining kinematic chain, are not equal one to other.

40|$|Congestion in {{the radio}} {{spectrum}} is forcing emerging high rate wireless communication systems into upper microwave and millimeterwave frequency bands, where transceiver hardware architectures are less mature. One way to realize a simple and elegant hardware solution for a microwave transmitter is to exploit the advantages of directly modulating the phase of the carrier signal. A modulation method requiring continuous phase control of the carrier signal over the full 360 degree range is Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK). Unfortunately, {{it is very difficult}} to design a microwave circuit to provide linear phase control of a carrier signal over the full 360 degree range using traditional methods. A novel method of obtaining continuous, linear phase modulation of a microwave carrier signal over the full 360 degree range is proposed. This method is based on controlling a phase shifter, at a subharmonic of the desired <b>output</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency, and then using a frequency multiplier to obtain the desired output frequency. The phase shifter is designed to be highly linear over a fraction of the full 360 range. The frequency multiplier is a nonlinear circuit that shifts the frequency by *'N'. The subtle part of this nonlinear operation is that the multiplier also multiplies the instantaneous phase of the phase shifter output signal by *'N', thus expanding the linear phase shift range to the required 360 degrees. Using this nonlinear frequency multiplication principle, the modulator can readily be extended into the millimeterwave region. A prototype circuit is designed and performance results are presented for this method of carrier phase modulation at 18 GHz. The prototype circuit is realized with very simple hardware, containing only a single microwave active device. An extension to the modulator involving phase locking or injection locking of a power oscillator is also suggested for obtaining higher power modulated output signals. In addition to direct continuous phase modulation, the proposed method is also suitable for a wide variety of transceiver applications, including phase synchronization of antenna and oscillator arrays, phased array antenna beam steering, indirect frequency modulation, and ultra-small carrier frequency translation...|$|E

The nature of the bonds formed between theAtoCamino acids and the specific DNA residues was investigated with molecular modeling.

The work is initially placed into {{the context of}} relevant fibre sensor applications for aerospace. Candidate non-linear processes are then described and Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) targeted as a suitable mechanism. The SBS process in monomode fibres is then fully described, including a theoretical assessment {{of the magnitude of}} both pump and Stokes signals with fibre length. The project developed, firstly, an all-optical frequency shifter using SBS which generated <b>output</b> <b>carriers</b> in the 1 - 70 OMHz regýon, depending on fibre type and system topology. In particular, a single-fibre system was demonstrated for the first time. Limitations of the technique arose through fibre photosensitivity and non-linear dynamical effects which, respectively, increased the input pump power requirements and introduced intensity and frequency instabilities into the output signal. Both processes were investigated fully. Optical fibre and pump characteristics, and system configurations, were therefore identified which minimised their impact. The same SBS heterodyning principles were then used to investigate single-pump sensor systems. Both 'quasi-point' and two-element, multiplexed temperature sensors were demonstrated. A linear relationship between the Stokes frequency and temperature was obtained from 5 to 55 'C, determined primarily by the thermal response of the acoustic phonon velocity. The sensing resolution was typically ± 2 'C, limited by the non-linear dynamical effects, and the spatial resolution was determined by the pump/fibre interaction length. One unique sensing element per optical input was demonstrated. These results are then placed in the context of systems utilising alternative SBS-based strategies, other non-linear effects and fibre ring resonators. Management elements of the project were covered by detailing both the technical and strategic motivations for undertaking the research and, by describing the issues on which a cost benefit analysis of fibre sensors for aircraft can be undertaken...|$|R
