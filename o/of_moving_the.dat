5|$|After the {{unexpected}} loss of Armendáriz, production proceeded, experiencing complications from uncredited rewrites by Berkely Mather during filming. Editor Peter Hunt set about editing the film while key elements were {{still to be}} filmed, helping to restructure the opening scenes. Hunt and Young conceived <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> Red Grant training sequence {{to the beginning of}} the film (prior to the main title), a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld was rewritten, and back projection was used to re-film Lotte Lenya's lines.|$|E
5|$|Authorities of Belize City {{considered}} {{abandoning the}} community and moving it to higher ground. Additionally, there was a proposal to relocate the capital further south or inland to the pine ridge, with either resulting in a higher elevation of the capital. However, the process <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> capital did not begin until 1961, after Belize City was devastated by Hurricane Hattie.

5|$|In 2002, Coria and Currie {{found that}} various {{features}} of the rear part of the skull (such as the frontwards slope of the occiput and low and wide occipital condyle) indicate that Giganotosaurus {{would have had a}} good capability <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> skull sideways in relation to the front neck vertebrae. These features may also have been related to the increased mass and length of the jaw muscles; the jaw articulation of Giganotosaurus and other carcharodontosaurids was moved hindwards to increase the length of the jaw musculature, enabling faster closure of the jaws, whereas tyrannosaurs increased the mass of the lower jaw musculature, to increase the power of their bite.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1847, Detroit {{fought to}} {{maintain}} the Capitol within its jurisdiction, but communities in the growing {{western part of the}} state had many reasons for wanting a move inland, including the need to increase defensibility by moving the state government away from the Canada–US border. Detroit had been occupied during the War of 1812, and the border area of Michigan of less than a mile between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, at the Detroit River continued to be occupied by British troops on both banks. Proponents <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> capitol also sought to promote settlement and the economy in the interior, as well as making the government more accessible to the people throughout the state.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{were already}} {{preparing}} to produce radar sets locally. Oliphant persuaded Professor Thomas Laby to release Eric Burhop and Leslie Martin {{from their work}} on optical munitions to work on radar, and they succeeded in building a cavity magnetron in their laboratory at the University of Melbourne in May 1942. Oliphant worked with Martin on the process <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> magnetrons for the laboratory to the production line.

5|$|In a Chess Notes feature article, Edward Winter {{showed that}} the origins of this opening are not yet entirely elucidated. The first known game with the Budapest Gambit is Adler–Maróczy (played in Budapest in 1896). This game already {{featured}} some key aspects of the gambit, such as active play for the black pieces, and White making the typical mistake <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> queen too early. As the player of the white pieces was not a strong player, the new opening went unnoticed apart from the local experts who had witnessed the game. The Hungarians István Abonyi, Zsigmond Barász and Gyula Breyer further developed the opening. Abonyi played it in 1916 against the Dutch surgeon Johannes Esser in a small tournament in Budapest. The Austrian player Josef Emil Krejcik played it against Helmer in Vienna in 1917. Carl Schlechter published an optimistic analysis of the gambit in the Deutsche Schachzeitung.|$|E
5|$|Other {{business}} in the session included creating a special fund that would allow Jefferson to recover the USS Philadelphia, which had been captured {{off the coast of}} northern Africa, and the repeal of the Bankruptcy Act of 1800; Breckinridge supported the passage of both measures. He feared that passage of an act making permanent the pay raises for executive administrative personnel first enacted in 1799 would hurt his party in the upcoming elections, especially in the House, but the act passed and there was no significant backlash at the polls. Robert Wright's measure adjourning Congress to Baltimore, Maryland, in protest of legislators' poor accommodations in Washington, D.C., was defeated by a vote of 9–19, but Breckinridge considered the issue <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> U.S. capital worthy of further study. Breckinridge supported the successful impeachment of federal judge John Pickering and also served on the Senate committee that prepared the rules governing the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase. The latter impeachment was widely seen as politically motivated, and some Democratic-Republicans joined the Federalist minority in voting for acquittal. Majorities were obtained on only three of the eight articles of impeachment, and each of those fell at least three votes short of the required two-thirds majority. Breckinridge and three other Democratic-Republicans voted to convict on every article except the fifth, on which every senator sided with Chase.|$|E
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-40 (NATO {{reporting}} name: Brawny) was a two-seat Soviet jet-engined armored ground-attack aircraft. The first prototype flew in 1953 and {{was very}} successful except when it fired its guns, as their combustion gasses disturbed the airflow into the engines and caused them to flameout or hiccup. Remedying this problem took over a year and involved the radical change <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> engine air intakes {{all the way to}} the very front of the aircraft and repositioning the guns from the tip of the nose to the bottom of the fuselage, just behind the nosewheel. The aircraft, now resembling a double-barreled shotgun from the front, was ordered into production in 1955. Only five production aircraft had been completed before the entire program was canceled in early 1956 when the VVS discarded its close air-support doctrine in favor of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield.|$|E

Furthermore we have estimated the local cluster energy (LCE) to compare the energy change in <b>the</b> different <b>moving</b> path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Li ion. The total bond overlap population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> Li ion along the conduction path changed smaller than those of the other paths. On the other hand, the changes of the net charges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> Li ions were similar in any paths. The change of the LCE in the model cluster of the conduction path was much smaller than that in another model cluster. As the results, the smaller change of the total bond overlap population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> Li ions played an important role for the fast ion movement in the Li ion conductors, rather than the change of the net charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> Li ions.

A survey by the Edinburgh Evening News found that 37 of 58 councillors favoured Murrayfield, with nine favouring Hampden. Supporters <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> game to Murrayfield cited its greater capacity, convenience {{for the majority of}} fans and the precedent of the 1896 Scottish Cup Final. The Scottish Football Association stated that no venue other than Hampden would be considered. Supporters of keeping the game at Hampden cited that the players would prefer to play at the national football stadium and that some fans had already begun to make arrangements for the tie being in Glasgow. First ScotRail provided additional capacity on their routes between Edinburgh and Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|Douglas' cottage, {{located in}} Coconut Grove at 37443754 Stewart Avenue, {{was built in}} 1924. She wrote all of her major books and stories in the cottage, and the City of Miami {{designated}} it an historic site in 1995, {{not only for its}} famous owner but also for its unique Masonry Vernacular architecture. After Douglas' death, Friends of the Everglades proposed making the house part of an education center about Douglas and her life, but neighbors protested, citing issues with parking, traffic, and an influx of visitors to the quiet neighborhood. The house, which had an exterior floodwater line from the 1926 Miami Hurricane and some damage from an infestation of bees, had fallen further into disrepair. For a while, the idea <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> house to Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Coral Gables, which Douglas helped to develop and where there is a life size bronze statue to commemorate her efforts, was considered. The State of Florida owns Douglas' house and in April 2007 placed it in the care of the Florida Park Service, a division of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Restoration of the floors and counters took place in the following months. Water service was reconnected to the house and the electrical system was updated for safety purposes. All work was approved by the Department of Historic Resources. A park ranger was placed as a resident in the Douglas house to help maintain the structure and property.|$|E

On the other hand, the changes of the net charges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moving</b> cations were similar in any paths. Furthermore the relationship between ionic conductivity and the differential total bond overlap population (DBOP) was discussed in the lithium sulfide superionic conducting glasses. The cluster models were constructed by the coordination number reported by experimental methods and the bond length estimated from the ionic radii of each ion. Especially the relationship between ionic conductivity and the differential bond overlap population were discussed for the sulfide-based lithium ion conducting glasses in the systems Li 2 S-SiS 2 -Al 2 S 3 and Li 2 S-SiS 2 -P 2 S 5. In these glasses, the DBOP with the movement of the lithium ion had good negative correlations with the ionic conductivities and positive correlations with the activation energies obtained by the experimental measurements.
