5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> {{string theory}} or M-theory on an anti-de Sitter background. This {{means that the}} {{geometry}} of spacetime is {{described in terms of}} a certain vacuum solution of Einstein's equation called anti-de Sitter space.|$|E
5|$|The Blonde Bear {{was one of}} the world's {{greatest}} football players, {{who never}} missed an open field block.

5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, <b>one</b> <b>considers,</b> in {{addition}} to a theory of quantum gravity, a certain kind of quantum field theory called a conformal field theory. This is a particularly symmetric and mathematically well behaved type of quantum field theory. Such theories are often studied in the context of string theory, where they are associated with the surface swept out by a string propagating through spacetime, and in statistical mechanics, where they model systems at a thermodynamic critical point.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} this progress, the {{relationship}} between strings and five-dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable to quantize the branes. Starting in 1991, {{a team of researchers}} including Michael Duff, Ramzi Khuri, Jianxin Lu, and Ruben Minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions curl up. If <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> a five-dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions, then the brane looks just like a one-dimensional string. In this way, the conjectured relationship between strings and branes was reduced to a relationship between strings and strings, and the latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies were {{slightly}} more effective rushing the ball. In the ground game, seven different players carried {{the ball at}} least once, netting 135rushing yards. Branden Ore finished the game with 116yards, leading all rushers on both teams. That total put him just eightyards short of his second-straight 1,000-yard season. Ore's total is even more impressive when <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> {{that he had been}} suspended for the entire first quarter of the game, his place taken by backup rusher Kenny Lewis, Jr. Lewis finished the game with four carries for 22yards, and did not see much action after Ore entered the game {{at the beginning of the}} secondquarter.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastal erosion}} and {{salinization}} affecting {{the west of}} Senegal are also a source of concern on the island; signs of erosion have been observed in Carabane since 1849. The house of the government representative on the island has burned down twice; each time it was rebuilt, {{the site of the}} building had to be moved further and further inland. The island's erosion is evident when <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> that the original location of the house eventually became flooded, even at low tide. During the dry season the river has a tide-dominated delta, with tidewater reaching 200km upstream, while it is being concentrated 50% by evaporation.|$|E

25|$|As examples, any {{function}} or any functional (right-unique) relation is difunctional; {{the converse}} doesn't hold.

25|$|The algebra of {{continuous}} (real or complex) functions on a compact Hausdorff space is a commutative C*-algebra, and conversely by the Banach–Stone theorem one can recover the topology {{of the space}} from the algebraic properties of its algebra {{of continuous}} functions.

25|$|Chern–Simons {{theories}} {{are related to}} many other field theories. For example, if <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> a Chern–Simons theory with gauge group G on a manifold with boundary then all of the 3-dimensional propagating degrees of freedom may be gauged away, leaving a 2-dimensional conformal field theory known as a G Wess–Zumino–Witten model on the boundary. In addition the U(N) and SO(N) Chern–Simons theories at large N are well approximated by matrix models.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{difference}} between these systems is what makes analog computing useful. If <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> a simple mass–spring system, constructing the physical system would require making or modifying the springs and masses. This would be followed by attaching them to each other and an appropriate anchor, collecting test equipment with the appropriate input range, and finally, taking measurements. In more complicated cases, such as suspensions for racing cars, experimental construction, modification, and testing is both complicated and expensive.|$|E
25|$|When {{the base}} field is an algebraically closed field of {{characteristic}} p, the n-torsion is still isomorphic to (Z/nZ)2g when n and p are coprime. When n and p are not coprime, {{the same result}} can be recovered provided one interprets it {{as saying that the}} n-torsion defines a finite flat group scheme of rank 2g. If instead of looking at the full scheme structure on the n-torsion, <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> only the geometric points, one obtains a new invariant for varieties in characteristic p (the so-called p-rank when n = p).|$|E
40|$|The {{electoral cycle}} {{literature}} has developed in two clearly distinct phases.

In this sense, <b>one</b> may <b>consider</b> perceptrons as learning mechanisms used by voters to perform a classification of the incumbent in order to distinguish opportunistic (electorally motivated) from benevolent (non-electorally motivated) behaviour of the government. The paper explores precisely {{the problem of how}} to classify a government showing in which, if so, circumstances a perceptron can resolve that problem. This is done by considering a model recently considered in the literature, i. e. one allowing for output persistence, which is a feature of aggregate supply that, indeed, may turn impossible to correctly classify the government...|$|R
