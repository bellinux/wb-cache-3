5|$|<b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> this {{camera system}} {{is that it allows}} the game {{designers}} to use the language of film. Indeed, like filmmakers, they have the possibility to create a mood through camerawork and careful selection of shots. Games that use this kind of technique are often praised for their cinematic qualities.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> {{this design}} {{was that the}} diodes created light around the same {{frequency}} as the laser glass' output, {{as compared to the}} white light flashtubes where most of the energy in the flash was wasted as it was not near the active frequency of the laser glass. This change increased the energy efficiency to about 10%, a dramatic improvement.|$|E
5|$|The Firefight game mode was a late {{addition}} to the game. Staffer Tim Williams built a prototype shortly after Halo 3 shipped, placing the player in {{a portion of a}} Halo 3 campaign map and fighting enemies. When development commenced on ODST, William's concept was adopted for the game and refined. Designer Lars Bakken described <b>one</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the game mode as providing a more friendly multiplayer environment than hardcore players online. The designers reused the campaign scoring and medal system from Halo 3 to add a competitive edge.|$|E

5|$|Deliveries of 1972 stock enabled 1938 {{stock to}} be withdrawn, and several cars were {{converted}} {{for use as}} ballast motor cars. The task was more complicated than for earlier stock, as 1938 units had compressors mounted on the trailer cars. The motor cars therefore had to be fitted with compressors, and the couplings were changed from Wedgelock to Ward type. The first four were numbered L140 to L143, and the conversion was carried out at Acton Works in 1972. Another six were converted, two in 1975, two in 1976, and the final two in 1977, which were numbered L144 to L149. L151 and L152 were converted in 1978, and were additionally fitted with weed killing equipment. Another four were added in the same year, numbered L153 to L156. Although the ballast motor cars were normally worked in pairs, some engineering trains had a ballast motor car {{at one end and}} a battery locomotive at the other. <b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the ballast motor cars over battery locomotives was that the interiors could be used by personnel and for storing small tools, although they were less powerful, and could only work when the traction current was switched on. By 2002, all except the weed killing pair had been withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|The American Psychiatric Association (APA) {{guidelines}} note that, in general, benzodiazepines {{are well}} tolerated, {{and their use}} for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy {{should be based on}} the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. <b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of substance abuse. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> {{photodiode}} arrays (PDAs) is {{that they}} allow for high speed parallel read out since the driving electronics may not be built in like a traditional CMOS or CCD sensor.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> {{overglaze}} china painting {{compared to}} oil or watercolor is the paint may be removed {{with a slightly}} wetted brush while the color is still moist, bringing back the original ground.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> limited gimbal {{movement}} such as Skylab's is that singularities {{are less}} of a problem. If Skylab's inner gimbals {{had been able to}} reach 90 degrees or more away from zero, then the 'North and South poles' could have become singularities; the gimbal stops prevented this.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> methane {{is that it}} is {{abundant}} {{in many parts of the}} solar system and it could potentially be harvested on the surface of another solar-system body (in particular, using methane production from local materials found on Mars or Titan), providing fuel for a return journey.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> this {{alternative}} realization is that equality is identity, not an inductively defined relation. Unlike Conway's {{realization of the}} surreal numbers, however, the sign-expansion requires a prior construction of the ordinals, while in Conway's realization, the ordinals are constructed as particular cases of surreals.|$|E
25|$|An {{absolute}} reference {{includes all}} directory levels. In some systems, a filename reference {{that does not}} include the complete directory path defaults to the current working directory. This is a relative reference. <b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> using a relative reference in program configuration files or scripts is that different instances of the script or program can use different files.|$|E

Although the schools were segregated, black and white teachers were paid on an equal scale. The system attracted highly qualified teachers, especially for the M Street School (later called Dunbar High School), the academic high school for African Americans.|$|E
25|$|Interpreters {{are used}} to execute source code from a {{programming}} language line-by-line. The interpreter decodes each statement and performs its behavior. <b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> interpreters {{is that they can}} easily be extended to an interactive session. The programmer is presented with a prompt, and individual lines of code are typed in and performed immediately.|$|E
25|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that intermodulation distortion is not present in the live audio and so it represents an artificial coloration to the live sound. <b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> higher sampling rates {{is that they can}} relax the low-pass filter design requirements for ADCs and DACs, but with modern oversampling sigma-delta converters this advantage is less important.|$|E
50|$|<b>One</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> {{rechargeable}} metal-air batteries is use {{of oxygen}} {{from the atmosphere}} as oxidant in the battery. The absence of a stored solid oxidant within the cell means that, in principle, the energy density of these cells can be quite large. The use of low cost and abundant metals, such as zinc, at the anode {{and the absence of}} hermetic packaging means that the cost of metal-air batteries can be very low.|$|R

We experimented with metonymy interpretation and obtained a precision rate of 66 % when using this method. Comment: 8 pages. Computation and Languag...|$|R
25|$|In the {{language}} of tensor algebra, a particular tensor {{is associated with a}} particular shape with many lines projecting upwards and downwards, corresponding to abstract upper and lower indices of tensors respectively. Connecting lines between two shapes corresponds to contraction of indices. <b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> this notation is that one does not have to invent new letters for new indices. This notation is also explicitly basis-independent.|$|E
25|$|John Conrad Waterlow {{established}} a new classification for malnutrition. Instead of using just weight for age measurements, the classification established by Waterlow combines weight-for-height (indicating acute episodes of malnutrition) with height-for-age {{to show the}} stunting that results from chronic malnutrition. <b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the Waterlow classification over the Gomez classification is that weight for height can be examined even if ages are not known.|$|E
25|$|Multi-scale {{approach}} is a multiple resolution approach in vessel segmentation. At low resolution, large-diameter vessels can first be extracted. By increasing resolution, smaller branches from the large vessels can be easily recognized. Therefore, <b>one</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> using this technique is the increased analytical speed. Additionally, this approach {{can be used with}} 3D images. The surface representation is a surface normal to the curvature of the vessels, allowing the detection of abnormalities on vessel surface.|$|E
