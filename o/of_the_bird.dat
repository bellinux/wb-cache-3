5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable individual identification. This helps in {{keeping track of the}} movements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Some early {{travellers}} found dodo meat unsavoury, {{and preferred}} to eat parrots and pigeons; others {{described it as}} tough but good. Some hunted dodos only for their gizzards, as this was considered the most delicious part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird.</b> Dodos were easy to catch, but hunters {{had to be careful}} not to be bitten by their powerful beaks.|$|E
5|$|Subfossils {{were also}} {{recovered}} during the 1860s, but more complete remains were found during the 1874 transit of Venus, since an observation station was {{located on the}} island. Many of these excavations were requested by brothers Alfred and Edward Newton, who used them to describe the osteology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> in detail. Thousands of bones were excavated, and mounted skeletons were composed from the remains of several specimens. It {{has been suggested that}} the skeleton of this species is the best described after that of humans. In spite of this, some later scholars doubted Leguat's story, and the existence of the Rodrigues solitaire. In 1955, George Evelyn Hutchinson doubted aspects of the bird's biology mentioned by Leguat, and in 1921, G. Atkinson claimed the memoir was merely a novel, and that the man had never even existed. Today, it is widely accepted that Leguat's memoirs are credible observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> in life.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{other birds}} on the island, {{the species is}} not hunted, and is {{protected}} under Schedule 1 of Nauru's Wild Birds Preservation Ordinance 1937.

5|$|A {{nematode}} (Myrmeconema neotropicum) that infects canopy ants (Cephalotes atratus) {{causes the}} black-coloured gasters of workers to turn red. The parasite also alters the behaviour of the ant, {{causing them to}} carry their gasters high. The conspicuous red gasters are mistaken by birds for ripe fruits, such as Hyeronima alchorneoides, and eaten. The droppings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> are collected by other ants and fed to their young, leading to further spread of the nematode.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{names for}} crow or raven species include very {{possibly}} gbgb/gbg3; this bird is once called 3pd km or 'black bird', while its eggs could apparently be gathered {{according to a}} medical papyrus, and therefore points to a breeding bird of Egypt.

5|$|Brown {{pelicans}} and double-crested cormorants {{are mainly}} found on cliffs {{along the coast}} and on seastacks, while sandpipers and gulls inhabit the seacoast and inland areas.

5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{are both}} monogamous and polygamous; although broods are generally {{brought up by}} one male and one female, occasionally the pair may have an extra helper.

5|$|Its growing rarity {{increased}} interest from European museums and private collectors in obtaining skins and eggs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird.</b> On 3 June 1844, {{the last two}} confirmed specimens were killed on Eldey, {{off the coast of}} Iceland, ending the last known breeding attempt. Later reports of roaming individuals being seen or caught are unconfirmed. A record of one great auk in 1852 is considered by some to be the last sighting of a member of the species. The great auk is mentioned in several novels and the scientific journal of the American Ornithologists' Union is named The Auk in honour of this bird.|$|E
5|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through {{evaporation}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a reason for}} this behavior, but it does not make any sense in the cold Andean habitat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird.</b> Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Major nest predators include Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbirds (Cracticus spp.), {{laughing}} kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) {{as well as}} introduced mammals such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), cat (Felis catus) {{and black}} rat (Rattus rattus). Like other species of fairywrens, splendid fairywrens may use a 'rodent-run' display to distract predators from nests with young birds. While doing this, the head, neck and tail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> are lowered, the wings are held out and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.|$|E

5|$|Most birds can fly, which distinguishes {{them from}} almost all other {{vertebrate}} classes. Flight {{is the primary}} means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird)</b> and the supracoracoideus, {{as well as a}} modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.|$|E
5|$|Orientation {{behaviour}} {{studies have}} been traditionally carried out using variants of a setup known as the Emlen funnel, which consists of a circular cage with the top covered by glass or wire-screen so that either the sky is visible or the setup is placed in a planetarium or with other controls on environmental cues. The orientation behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> inside the cage is studied quantitatively using the distribution of marks that the bird leaves {{on the walls of}} the cage. Other approaches used in pigeon homing studies make use of the direction in which the bird vanishes on the horizon.|$|E
