500|$|Although Marshall was not {{frequently}} {{active in}} {{debate on the}} Senate floor, he was a strong advocate of nearly every Federalist measure considered in that body. Many of these were unpopular in Kentucky, including the Alien and Sedition Acts. Marshall's {{vote in favor of}} the Jay Treaty was particularly unpopular with his constituents, and when he returned home after the vote, a mob of angry citizens in Frankfort stoned him. Next, the mob tried to throw Marshall into the Kentucky River. Marshall appealed to the Baptists in the crowd, declaring, [...] "Now allow me to say that according to Baptist rules, it is irregular to administer baptism before the receiver gives his experience. If you are determined to proceed, let the exercise be performed in decent order. Let me give my experience first." [...] The thought of hearing a religious testimony from Marshall, a noted atheist, so humored the mob that it disbanded in a fit <b>of</b> <b>laughter,</b> <b>and</b> Marshall escaped. In the subsequent senatorial election, however, Breckinridge defeated Marshall for his seat.|$|E

However, one day Maeda was struck by inspiration, where he thought up the initial idea of a story set in the afterlife. Furthermore, with everyone already dead, Maeda conceived of flashy battles where the combatants go all out without fear of death. According to Maeda, the theme of the series is [...] "life", which in Angel Beats! is depicted as a precious and wonderful thing, despite the characters in Angel Beats! who fight against their fate.|$|E
