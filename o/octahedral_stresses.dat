We test these criteria against molecular dynamics simulations of deformation in amorphous polymer glasses under triaxial loading conditions that are difficult to realize in experiments. Difficulties and ambiguities in extending several standard definitions of the yield point to triaxial loads are described. Two definitions, the maximum and offset <b>octahedral</b> <b>stresses,</b> are then used to evaluate the yield stress {{for a wide range of}} model parameters. In all cases, the onset of shear is consistent with the pressure-modified von Mises criterion, and the pressure coefficient is nearly independent of many parameters.

The primary objective of this work is to investigate the resilient modulus of four typical Victorian fine-grained subgrade soils under traffic-like repeated loading and to suggest empirical predictive models incorporating physical properties and/or strength of the soils along with the stress state. A repeated load triaxial testing procedure was developed, which is capable of collecting resilient and permanent deformation data from the same specimen. Stress levels for testing were defined as percentages of the confined and/or unconfined soil static strengths. Stress dependency of resilient modulus was studied through the models (such as bilinear model, power model, deviatoris stress model and octahedral stress model) {{found in the literature}} and other possible combinations of deviator, confining and <b>octahedral</b> <b>stresses.</b> A semi-logarithmic model was proposed for the prediction of resilient modulus of the fine-grained subgrade soils. Calibration of model constants by soil properties was investigated. An altervative prediction model was also developed based on unconfined compressive strength and deviator stress. Resilient modulus values were back calculated using both the semi-logarithmic model and the model based on unconfined compressive strength and deviator stress. Predicted values were compared with the measured values. Predictive capability of the proposed models were proven for use in flexible pavement design...|$|E
40|$|Over {{a period}} of time, {{railroad}} track will settle {{as a result of}} permanent deformation in the ballast and underlying soil layers produced by traffic loading. After track settlement is produced, maintenance will be needed to resurface and line the track. Maintenance is desired as soon as the loss of surface and line reaches a degree that interferes with proper vehicle operation or affects safety. The period of time between maintenance surfacing and lining operations is designated as 2 ̆ 2 maintenance life 2 ̆ 2 of the track. The purpose of this dissertation was to develop a methodology to calculate the elastic and cumulative inelastic behavior of the railroad track structures under traffic loading as a basis for maintenance life prediction. ^ The methodology involves a three-dimensional computer model to estimate the stress state in the roadbed materials caused by train loading, and laboratory testing on the ballast under static and repeated loading conditions equivalent to those in the field. Available field measurements from the U. S. Department of Transportation test track in Pueblo, Colorado were used to validate the predictions obtained with the proposed methodology. The predicted results were in approximate agreement with the field results. ^ The methodology developed appears to provide a reasonable and rational approach to predict the elastic and permanent deformation of railroad track systems. The method can take into account the main factors influencing the deformation behavior, including axle load and number of cycles, rail and tie characteristics, and properties and thickness of the ballast and underlying layers. ^ A review of analytical methods developed to design and predict the elastic performance of track structures was presented. Also, the available information about static and cyclic behavior of roadbed materials was summarized. ^ Field ballast density measurements were presented. It was found that the boundary condition in ballast materials plays a crucial role in determining the accuracy of the calculated sample density. A sample preparation method for the laboratory samples was developed. ^ The analytical model GEOTRACK was chosen to determine the stress paths to which the ballast samples were subjected in the laboratory property tests. In the model, the two rails are designated as beams supported by eleven ties. The ties rested on a series of elastic layers of infinite horizontal extent representing the ballast, sub-ballast and subgrade. The model for the layers was adapted from the Burmister 2 ̆ 7 s theory. An iteration scheme was included to represent the stress-dependent nature of the roadbed materials. The approach taken to determine <b>octahedral</b> <b>stresses</b> in the field and their equivalent triaxial stresses in the laboratory was presented. ^ Static and cyclic tests were performed on granite ballast following the stress paths previously determined. All the tests were isotropically consolidated, drained tests with saturated samples. A large triaxial cell was built and special preparation methods and testing techniques were developed. From the static tests, Mohr-Coulomb strength parameters and hyperbolic stress-strain curves were determined. Two sets of properties were obtained from the cyclic tests: first, the elastic behavior in terms of a stress-dependent, resilient modulus; and second, the permanent strain accumulation as a function of stress state, physical state and number of cycles of load application. ^ A step-by-step application of the method of predicting elastic and inelastic deformations for ballast layers was presented. The results were compared with the measured values from the field experiments. ^ Finally, conclusions and recommendations from the study were presented. ...|$|E

MethodsTen females with PFP and ten gender, age, and activity-matched pain-free controls participated. Patella and femur stress profiles were quantified utilizing subject-specific finite element (FE) models of the patellofemoral joint at 15 ° and 45 ° of knee flexion. Input parameters for the FE model included: (1) joint geometry, (2) quadriceps muscle forces, and (3) weight-bearing patellofemoral joint kinematics. Using a nonlinear FE solver, quasi-static loading simulations were performed to quantify each subject’s patellofemoral joint stress profile during a static squatting maneuver. The patella and femur peak and mean hydrostatic pressure {{as well as the}} peak and mean <b>octahedral</b> shear <b>stress</b> for the elements representing the chondro-osseous interface were quantified.

Seismic waves may reveal {{the presence of the}} transition but a proper characterization is required. We first obtain a stress–strain relation, including the effects of shear seismic attenuation and ductility due to shear deformations and plastic flow. The anelastic behavior is based on the Burgers mechanical model to describe the effects of seismic attenuation and steady-state creep flow. The shear Lamé constant of the brittle and ductile media depends on the in situ stress and temperature through the shear viscosity, which is obtained by the Arrhenius equation and the <b>octahedral</b> <b>stress</b> criterion.

It {{is the object of}} this investigation to determine the effect of the axial compression on the maximum stresses created by the shear load. As a preliminary objective, the stress distribution along the shear plane will be determined using photoelastic techniques. The distortion energy theory of failure, and its corollary the <b>octahedral</b> shear <b>stress</b> theory, establish a relationship between the combined applied loads and the yield stress of the material and will be used in this investigation.

The normal stress distributions at the shear plane were determined and the effect of axial compression established. The shear stress was found to be a maximum near the edges of the beam. Under axial compression the shear stresses near the edges were reduced and the minimum stresses (at the midsection) were increased somewhat. The normal stresses perpendicular to the plane of investigation were found to be compressive near the edges and tensile in the midsection.

40|$|Evaluation {{of recent}} {{advances}} in tire technologies such as advanced deflection agricultural tires (Firestone IF and VF) and precision tire inflation technologies on soil compaction, traction, fuel economy and crop yield responses are important. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the effects of field and transport (road) tire inflation pressure settings of row-crop agricultural tractor and planter tires on soil compaction. A randomized complete block design experiment was conducted at the Iowa State University farm at Boone, Iowa for two tire inflation pressure levels on Dual Front (Firestone IF 420 / 85 R 34) and Dual Rear (Firestone IF 480 / 80 R 50) tires on a John Deere 8310 R MFWD tractor, and transport tires (Super single 445 / 50 R 22. 5) on a John Deere DB 60 planter. Soil compaction was measured using Stress State Transducers (SSTs) buried at 15 -cm and 30 -cm depths beneath the untrafficked soil surface. The soil cone index depth profile was measured at tire-centerline, tire-edge and 20 cm laterally outboard of the tire edge before and after tractor-planter tire passes. Peak <b>Octahedral</b> Normal <b>Stress</b> (ONS) and the corresponding <b>Octahedral</b> Shear <b>Stress</b> (OSS) values in soil were calculated from the SST data. The peak ONS and corresponding OSS values from the road tire inflation pressure settings were statistically higher (p-value 3 ̆c 0. 05) than the field tire inflation pressure settings. The maximum ONS was observed at 15 cm soil depth from the road tire inflation pressure setting of the rear tractor tires (179 kPa tire inflation pressure and 33 kN load per tire). The ONS from the front tractor tires (138 kPa tire inflation pressure and 17 kN load per tire) and planter transportation tires (620 kPa tire inflation pressure and 16. 5 kN load per tire) were similar. Cone index data also showed significant differences, comparing before and after tires passes, at the tire-centerline. The peak cone index values for the 0 to 100 mm soil depth range were 1. 3 MPa and 1. 2 MPa from the road and field tire inflation pressure settings, respectively...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the tarmat behavior {{at the moment of}} geomechanical failure, tarmat deformation analysis should be coupled with a failure criterion. There are a number of theories that predict failure as a function of prevailing stresses. For example, the maximum shear stress failure theory, as originally developed by Charles Coulomb and Henry Tresca, indicates that the failure point is reached when the maximum shear stress in the material becomes equal to the value of the shear stress at yielding. This point, which indicates the occurance of failure is referred as yield strength. Yield strenght is a property of the material which needs to be experimentally determined by uniaxial compression or uniaxial tension test. The Mohr–Coulomb failure (internal friction) criterion is another common way of evaluating failure by relating shearing resistance to contact forces, friction and cohesion that is present among the rock grains and it is deemed to be appropriate for the prediction of failure in brittle materials. Other failure criteria include the maximum normal stress failure criterion, Hoek–Brown failure criterion, Von Mises failure criterion, and the <b>octahedral</b> shear <b>stress</b> theory, among others.|$|R
40|$|The {{unique and}} complex {{deformation}} behaviour of ductile polymers has received considerable {{attention in the}} polymer field. Much {{research has been conducted}} to study the yielding and post-yielding behaviour of polymers. In the case of two-phase polymer alloy systems, however, the deformation behaviour near the interface between the two phases has rarely been studied. The present paper describes the use of two-dimensional (2 -D) finite element methods (FEM) to simulate the deformation behaviour of a polycarbonate plate with a circular hole as a special case of two-phase polymer alloys. The FEM model involves consideration of the non-linear behaviour of the material. The FEM simulation results reveal that the maximum <b>octahedral</b> shear <b>stress</b> ([tau]oct) shifts from the equatorial region toward the 45 [deg] region at the interface between the hole and the ductile matrix phase. How far the maximum [tau]oct shifts along the interface depends on the stress concentration near the interface and the strain increment between the yield and the strain hardening regions. The shift in maximum [tau]oct is due to the yield and strain softening character of ductile polymers. These results are verified by polycarbonate/hole (PC/hole) experiments...|$|R
