5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{bonus of}} the Bruneval raid was the Germans' {{efforts to improve}} defences at Würzburg stations and prevent similar attacks. The radars were surrounded by rings of barbed wire which increased their visibility from the air, making them easier to target prior to Operation <b>Overlord.</b>|$|E
5|$|COSSAC {{was charged}} with {{planning}} three operations: Operation Cockade, a deception operation to keep German forces pinned to the coast; Operation Rankin, a plan for measures {{to be taken in}} the case of a sudden German collapse; and Operation <b>Overlord,</b> a plan for a full-scale assault on north western Europe. Morgan and his staff worked on the <b>Overlord</b> plan throughout June and the first half of July 1943. He presented it to the Chiefs of Staff Committee on 15 July. The plan set forth in detail the conditions under which the assault could be made, the area where a landing would be feasible, and the means by which a lodgement on the continent would be developed.|$|E

25|$|In 1858, the Maronite peasants, {{stirred by}} the clergy, revolted against their Druze feudal <b>overlords</b> and {{established}} a peasant republic. In southern Lebanon, where Maronite peasants worked for Druze <b>overlords,</b> Druze peasants sided with their <b>overlords</b> against the Maronites, transforming the conflict into a civil war. Although both sides suffered, about 10,000 Maronites were massacred {{at the hands of}} the Druze.|$|R

5|$|For most of {{the eighth}} century, Mercia was {{dominant}} among the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms south of the river Humber. Æthelbald, {{who came to the}} throne in 716, had established himself as the <b>overlord</b> of the southern Anglo-Saxons by 731. He was assassinated in 757, and was briefly succeeded by Beornred, but within a year Offa ousted Beornred and took the throne for himself. Offa's daughter Eadburh married Beorhtric of Wessex in 789, and Beorhtric became an ally thereafter. In Kent, Offa intervened decisively in the 780s, and at some point became the <b>overlord</b> of East Anglia, whose king, Æthelred, was beheaded at Offa's orders in 794.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{embroidery}} of 1965 {{commemorating the}} 900th {{anniversary of the}} Battle of Hastings the following year, and the <b>Overlord</b> embroidery of 1968 commemorating the D-Day invasion of France during World War II, now in the D-Day museum in Southsea, Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{generally}} accepted Bede's report of Coenred's and Offa's abdications, but Barbara Yorke {{has suggested that}} they may not have relinquished their thrones voluntarily. There are instances of kings being forcibly removed and placed in holy orders to make them ineligible for kingship; one such was King Osred II of Northumbria, who was forced into a monastery. On the other hand, if Coenred went willingly, as Bede relates, then the apparently friendly relationship between Offa and Coenred, his <b>overlord,</b> makes it clear that the relationship between an <b>overlord</b> and his underking was not hostile in every case.|$|E

5|$|Humankind {{enters a}} golden age of {{prosperity}} {{at the expense of}} creativity. Five decades after their arrival, the Overlords reveal their appearance, resembling the traditional Christian folk images of demons: large bipeds with cloven hooves, leathery wings, horns, and tails. The Overlords are interested in psychic research, which humans suppose is part of their anthropological study. Rupert Boyce, a prolific book collector on the subject, allows one <b>Overlord,</b> Rashaverak, to study these books at his home. To impress his friends with Rashaverak's presence, Boyce holds a party, during which he makes use of a Ouija board. Jan Rodricks, an astrophysicist and Rupert's brother-in-law, asks the identity of the Overlords' home star. George Greggson's future wife Jean faints as the Ouija board reveals a star-catalog number consistent with the direction in which <b>Overlord</b> supply ships appear and disappear. With the help of an oceanographer friend Jan Rodricks stows away on an <b>Overlord</b> supply ship and travels 40 light-years to their home planet. Due to the time dilation of special relativity at near-light speeds, the elapsed time on the ship is only a few weeks, and he arranges to endure it in drug-induced hibernation.|$|E
5|$|In April 1944, Loring and {{the group}} moved to England to fly {{missions}} against Nazi German targets. The 36th Fighter Group flew out of RAF Kingsnorth in Kent, England flying reconnaissance, fighter escort and interdiction missions. The missions involved striking military strongpoints in northern Europe in preparation for Operation <b>Overlord.</b> Following the success of <b>Overlord,</b> Loring continued to fly air support missions {{for the remainder of}} the conflict. By December, he had flown 55 combat missions. He had been awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions under fire on June 12, 1944 that destroyed ten enemy armored vehicles in the area of Coutances, France while on a dive-bombing mission.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944 Fleming {{oversaw the}} {{distribution}} of intelligence to Royal Navy units in preparation for Operation <b>Overlord.</b> He was replaced as head of 30AU on 6 June 1944, but maintained some involvement. He visited 30AU in the field during and after <b>Overlord,</b> especially following an attack on Cherbourg {{for which he was}} concerned that the unit had been incorrectly used as a regular commando force rather than an intelligence-gathering unit. This wasted the men's specialist skills, risked their safety on operations that did not justify the use of such skilled operatives, and threatened the vital gathering of intelligence. Afterwards, the management of these units was revised. He also followed the unit into Germany after it located, in Tambach Castle, the German naval archives from 1870.|$|E

50|$|There {{is a minor}} {{interlude}} {{in which}} the Delgonian <b>Overlords</b> seem to have returned. Because he had fought the <b>Overlords</b> before, Kinnison is asked to lead the expedition to hunt them down, and the reptilian Worsel comes along. The Delgonians are dispatched in fairly short order, but only after the loss of many good men. Kinnison agonizes over the casualties that they suffered because, although he and Worsel were mentally strong enough to resist the <b>Overlords,</b> his men were not.|$|R
5|$|Operation <b>Overlord</b> {{finally ended}} on 14 June and 1 ATF {{returned}} to Nui Dat. Overall, despite the heavy contact experienced early on, it had yielded little for the Australians although neither D445 or 33 NVA Regiment were encountered in Phuoc Tuy again. <b>Overlord</b> {{was one of}} the larger task force operations of the war, while it was also the last joint US-Australian battalion-sized operation. Indeed, although the fighting continued, Australian operations began to wind down. On 18 August 1971, Prime Minister William McMahon announced that 1 ATF would cease operations in October, commencing a phased withdrawal. Ultimately, the last Australian forces were withdrawn from Vietnam by 1973.|$|E

5|$|After 616, Rædwald, {{who ruled}} East Anglia {{during the first}} quarter of the seventh century, was the most {{powerful}} of the southern Anglo-Saxon kings. In the following decades, from the reign of Sigeberht onwards, East Anglia became increasingly dominated by Mercia. Raedwald's son Eorpwald was murdered by a pagan noble soon after he was baptised in around 627, after which East Anglia reverted into paganism for three years. In the void left by the death of Rædwald, the first <b>overlord</b> who originated north of the Thames, the pagan Penda of Mercia, emerged to challenge the pre-eminence of the new <b>overlord</b> (or bretwalda), Edwin of Northumbria. The reversion of East Anglia to rule by Eorpwald's successor, the pagan Ricberht, possibly due to Mercian influence, temporarily overthrew an important pillar of Edwin's authority.|$|E
50|$|Ancient English deeds {{subsequently}} {{refer to}} many lands across Sussex as 'Levetts,' indicating family possession of broad swaths of Sussex countryside. Among the family's holdings was the manor of Catsfield Levett, today {{known simply as}} Catsfield. Like most medieval Norman families, the Levetts depended on the web of feudal hierarchy. They held their lands as <b>overlords</b> in return for knight's service (commonly called Knight's fees). As their feudal <b>overlords</b> thrived, so did they; conversely, their fate was tied to the unpredictable fortunes of those same <b>overlords.</b>|$|R

50|$|The tenant family {{holding the}} manors of Powderham and Whitestone under the <b>overlords,</b> as did Ranulf in 1086, later adopted the surname de Powderham from their seat (as was usual) and {{continued}} to hold under the de Bohun <b>overlords</b> until they lost the lands by escheat (see below).|$|R
5|$|After delays due to both {{logistical}} {{difficulties and}} poor weather, the D-Day of <b>Overlord,</b> the largest amphibious operation ever, was postponed 24 hours to 6 June 1944. Eisenhower and Montgomery, commander of 21st Army Group, aimed to capture Caen {{within the first}} day, and liberate Paris within 90 days.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of John Sigismund, the Diet of Transylvania elected Christopher's younger brother, Stephen Báthory, voivode (or ruler) on 25 May 1571. Stephen made Christopher captain of Várad (now Oradea in Romania). The {{following}} year, the Ottoman Sultan, Selim II (who was the <b>overlord</b> of Transylvania), acknowledged the hereditary right of the Báthory family to rule the province.|$|E
5|$|Although Motul de San José {{had begun}} to refer to Tikal as its <b>overlord</b> in the late 4th century, by the 7th century various hieroglyphic texts mention that it was under the {{dominion}} of Calakmul, Tikal's greatest enemy, before again coming under the power of Tikal in the early 8th century.|$|E

5|$|Aristagoras {{had been}} {{approached}} by exiled Naxian aristocrats, who were seeking {{to return to their}} island. Seeing an opportunity to bolster his position in Miletus, Aristagoras sought the help of his <b>overlord,</b> the Persian king Darius the Great, and the local satrap, Artaphernes to conquer Naxos. Consenting to the expedition, the Persians assembled a force of 200 triremes under the command of Megabates.|$|E
5|$|Berkshire {{appears to}} have passed from Mercian to West Saxon control during Beorhtwulf's reign. The Welsh are {{recorded}} to have rebelled against Beorhtwulf's successor, Burgred, shortly after Beorhtwulf's death, suggesting that Beorhtwulf had been their <b>overlord.</b> Charters from Beorthwulf's reign show a strained relationship with the church, as Beorhtwulf seized land and subsequently returned it.|$|E
5|$|In April 1944, 2e DB {{was shipped}} to Britain to {{participate}} in Operation <b>Overlord,</b> the Allied invasion of northern France. Leclerc and his staff travelled by air in a converted B-24 Liberator bomber. The division moved to training areas in Yorkshire, where Leclerc established his headquarters on the estate of Henry Frederick Hotham, 7th Baron Hotham, at Dalton Hall, Beverley. Training was conducted in concert with Maczek's 1st Polish Armoured Division.|$|E
5|$|Although {{humanity}} and the <b>Overlords</b> have peaceful relations, some believe human innovation is being suppressed and that culture is becoming stagnant. One {{of these groups}} establishes New Athens, an island colony {{in the middle of}} the Pacific Ocean devoted to the creative arts, which George and Jean Greggson join. The <b>Overlords</b> conceal a special interest in the Greggsons' children, Jeffrey and Jennifer Anne, and intervene to save Jeffrey's life when a tsunami strikes the island. The <b>Overlords</b> have been watching them since the incident with the Ouija board, which revealed the seed of the coming transformation hidden within Jean.|$|R
50|$|The game {{offers several}} {{multiplayer}} modes. Slaughter pits two <b>Overlords</b> {{against each other}} in a head to head combat with potentially hundreds of minions.
