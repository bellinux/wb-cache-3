25|$|It {{is useful}} to compare the {{situation}} to the classical case. In both cases, the particle behaves as a free particle outside of the barrier region. A classical particle with energy E larger than the barrier height V0 will be slowed down but never reflected by the barrier, while a classical particle with E < V0 incident on the barrier from the left would always be reflected. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> found the quantum-mechanical result we {{will return to the}} question of how to recover the classical limit.|$|E

25|$|Although {{much effort}} {{has gone into}} {{restoring}} salt marshes worldwide, further research is needed. There are many setbacks and problems associated with marsh restoration that requires careful long-term monitoring. Information on all components of the salt marsh ecosystem should be understood and monitored from sedimentation, nutrient, and tidal influences, to behaviour patterns and tolerances of both flora and fauna species. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{a better understanding of}} these processes and not just locally, but over a global scale, we can then suggest more sound and practical management and restoration efforts {{that can be used to}} preserve our valuable marshes and put them back to their original state.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposing}} argument {{posits that}} terraforming {{would be an}} unethical interference in nature, and that given humanity's past treatment of Earth, other planets may {{be better off without}} human interference. Still others strike a middle ground, such as Christopher McKay, who argues that terraforming is ethically sound only <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> completely assured that an alien planet does not harbor life of its own; but that if it does, we should not try to reshape it to our own use, but we should engineer its environment to artificially nurture the alien life and help it thrive and co-evolve, or even co-exist with humans. Even this would be seen as a type of terraforming to the strictest of ecocentrists, who would say that all life has the right, in its home biosphere, to evolve without outside interference.|$|E
25|$|<b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{found the}} {{augmented}} shortest path, {{we want to}} make sure we ignore any other paths that are longer than this shortest paths. BFS algorithm marks nodes in path with distance with source being 0. Thus, after doing BFS, we can start at each unmatched vertex in U, follow the path by following nodes with distance that increments by 1. When we finally arrive at the destination vDummy, if its distance is 1 more than last node in V then we know that the path we followed is (one of the possibly many) shortest path. In that case we can go ahead and update the pairing for vertices on path in U and V. Note that each vertex in V on path, except for the last one, is non-free vertex. So updating pairing for these vertices in V to different vertices in U is equivalent to removing previously matched edge and adding new unmatched edge in matching. This is same as doing the symmetric difference (i.e. remove edges common to previous matching and add non-common edges in augmented path in new matching).|$|E

500|$|This argumentation is rejected, {{on the one}} hand, by the compatibilists. Those who {{adopt this}} {{position}} suggest that the question [...] "Are we free?"

The opposite of [...] "free" [...] is not [...] "caused" [...] but [...] "compelled" [...] or [...] "coerced". It is not appropriate to identify freedom with indetermination.
