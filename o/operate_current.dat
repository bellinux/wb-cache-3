40|$|To {{cope with}} the {{exponential}} traffic growth, increasingly diverse traffic mix including voice, video, machine-to-machine(M 2 M), and the spectrum shortage, wireless networks have to get densely deployed and dynamically adapt to meet the distinct requirements of diverse traffic classes. However, current network architectures are ill-equipped to support a dense and dynamic wireless infrastructure. First, since {{it will be impossible}} to obtain regularly placed cell sites for an infrastructure with higher density, basestations will be deployed wherever possible in a chaotic fashion. However, a chaotic and dense wireless deployment will be very complex to manage, since it will experience highly variable loads and unpredictable inter-cell interference among other things. Further since spectrum is limited, very likely all the basestations will be operating on the same frequency (referred to as frequency reuse factor of one). This leads to a tremendous amount of inter-cell interference, and that becomes the limiting factor for network capacity. Second, a dense infrastructure is very expensive to deploy and <b>operate.</b> <b>Current</b> deployments are unaffordable except to the largest operators, so a deployment with significantly higher density will likely be enormously expensive even for the largest operators, preventing smaller operators from expanding and offering consumers the choices they need. Rather than looking at the radio access layer as a collection of independent base stations, SoftRAN [1] proposes that all base stations deployed in a geographical area should be abstracted as a virtual big-base station which is made up of radio elements (the individual physical base stations).

40|$|As {{a result}} of twentieth century {{advances}} in medicine and standard of living there is {{a dramatic increase in}} the number of older people in the U.

Moreover, the fastest-growing subgroup within the older cohort is the “oldest old ” (85 years and older) [4]. The aging of the population has vast implications for designers of information systems. Currently, use of computer technology has become an integral component of work, education, communication, and entertainment. Technology is also being increasingly used within the health care realm for service delivery, inhome monitoring, interactive communication (such as between patient and physician), transfer of health information, and peer support. To function independently and successfully interact with the environment, people of all ages must interact with some form of technology on a regular basis.

Furthermore, although older adults represent one of the fastest-growing groups of Internet users, there is still a digital divide, especially for lower socioeconomic status older adults or those with physical impairments.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} social media on organisations, and in particular focuses on the way firms are using social media to construct “online celebrity” and the way social movement organisations acquire legitimacy through a blending of offline and online illegitimate actions. This thesis embraces a perspective at the intersection between institutional theory, communications theory and strategy to deeply understand the impact of social media that enables and constrains organisational actions. The study finds that social media are affecting the information-intensive environment where organisations <b>operate.</b> <b>Current</b> shifts in communication technology, such as new patterns and modes of communication, provide a useful natural experiment to analyse how different types of organisations, including firms and social movement organisations, are strategically adopting social media to help maintain or acquire social approval assets. This research into social media strategy in one large technology firm and in one social movement organisation shows how social media may enable firms to achieve valuable strategic positions {{in ways that are}} underexplored by current organisation literature, ultimately leading to celebrity and legitimacy acquisition. This thesis makes several contributions to organisational strategy and institutional theory. First, it introduces and develops the concept of online celebrity, which is a firm’s ability to attract public attention and affective investment from networked publics through social media. Second, it expands our understanding of legitimacy acquisition by including a blending of illegitimate offline and online actions by social movement organisations that challenge taken for granted cultural norms, dominant frames and powerful actors. Third, it outlines key social media tactics which focus on shaping the external organisational environment and the cognition and perception of key audiences. This thesis also presents future paths of research that organisation and management scholars should consider in order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how shifts in communication strategies facilitate larger shifts in social institutions and in the way organisations construct their interaction with stakeholder audiences.
