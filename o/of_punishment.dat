5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviet {{authorities}} {{began the}} widespread use of psychiatric treatment as a form <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> and deterrence for the independent-minded. This involved unlimited detention in a psikhushka, as such places were popularly known, which might be conventional psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric prison-hospitals set up (e.g. the Leningrad Special Psychiatricl Hospital) as part of an existing penal institution. Healthy individuals were held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients; they were forced to take various psychotropic drugs; they might also be incarcerated in prison-type institutions under overall control of the KGB.|$|E
5|$|Penelope's {{story is}} an attempt at {{narrative}} justice to retribute Helen for her erroneously idealised image in the Odyssey as the archetypal female. Penelope acts like a judicial arbiter, a position she held in Ithaca {{as the head of}} state and, during Odysseus' absence, as head of the household. The ancient form of justice and punishment, which was swift and simple {{due to the lack of}} courts, prisons, and currency, is tempered by more modern concepts of balanced distributions of social benefits and burdens. Penelope's chosen form <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> for Helen is to correct the historical records with her own bias by portraying her as vain and superficial, as someone who measures her worth by the number of men who died fighting for her.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} punish free-riders can {{increase}} the provision of public goods. However, sometimes the benefit of increased public good provision is outweighed by the costs <b>of</b> <b>punishments.</b> One reason a group may punish {{to the point that}} net welfare is reduced is that punishment can express anger about free-riding. If this is the case, then tools that regulate emotions could decrease the use <b>of</b> <b>punishments</b> while keeping welfare high, possibly depending on pre-existing levels of aggression. In this lab experiment, we find that adopting an objective attitude (Objective), through a form of emotion regulation called cognitive reappraisal, decreases the use <b>of</b> <b>punishments</b> and makes a statistically insignificant improvement to both net earnings and self-reported emotions compared to a control condition (Natural). Although the interaction between the emotion regulation treatment and level of aggression is not significant, only low aggression types reduce their punishments; the results are of the same direction but statistically insignificant for high aggression types. Overall, our findings suggest that pairing emotion regulation with punishments can decrease the use <b>of</b> <b>punishments</b> without harming monetary and mental welfare...|$|R

5|$|The {{number and}} names of hells, {{as well as}} the type of sinners sent to a {{particular}} hell, varies from text to text; however, many scriptures describe 28 hells. After death, messengers of Yama called Yamadutas bring all beings to the court of Yama, where he weighs the virtues and the vices of the being and passes a judgement, sending the virtuous to Svarga (heaven) and the sinners to one of the hells. The stay in Svarga or Naraka is generally described as temporary. After the quantum <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> is over, the souls are reborn as lower or higher beings as per their merits. In a few texts, hell is described as a bottomless pit of darkness where souls are trapped for eternity and deprived of rebirth.|$|E

Those condemned to death often were subjected to endure torture and later hanged outside Valletta, in the whereabouts of the Bastion of St. Jacob. According to , the historian of the Order, amid {{the last three days}} of the Maltese carnival the locals used to recite a Roman tradition at the Castellany by dangling a stone above the pillory (instead of a human) and hit it which symbolised a temporal halt <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> during those days.|$|E
5|$|After a short halt {{to leave}} their baggage train behind and form a battle line the Persian army quickly {{advanced}} on the Byzantines, shooting arrows as they approached. The Byzantines responded in kind and then sallied forth to meet the oncoming enemy. On the Byzantine right Vitalius was quickly victorious, his heavy cavalry breaking through the Persian flank and pushing his opponents to the left behind their own main line. At this point, however, disaster threatened as many of Vitalius' troopers broke formation and headed towards the enemy camp, intending to loot it. Philippicus, however, saw {{what had happened and}} reacted quickly. He gave his distinctive helmet to one of his bodyguards, Theodore Ilibinus, and sent him to rally the cavalry on pain <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> by the army commander himself. The ruse worked: the men recognized the helmet and returned to order just in time to stop the Persians, who had regrouped in the centre and were pushing the numerically inferior Byzantines back.|$|E
