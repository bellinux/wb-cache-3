Together they play Twister, which was all Pandora had wanted to do, along with {{learning}} from her friends about human sexuality. Cook offers to have sex with her, and they spend the night together. Effy visits Pandora the next morning, and sees Cook share a kiss with her as he leaves. Feeling hurt, she confronts Pandora, but to no avail, as Pandora is slightly empowered after losing her virginity. Pandora defiantly tells Effy that Cook, due to his promiscuity and impulsive, carnal behavior, belongs to no one. Effy appears to understand, and makes no rebuttal. Suddenly, Thomas appears and runs up to Pandora, and she sobs in his arms as a thoughtful Effy looks on.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor {{many years}} <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> {{dampness}} has assumed alarming dimensions {{in public and}} private buildings in Ghana. This paper presents a case study of a three bedroom residential bungalow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Urban Roads in Kumasi which suffers from <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> dampness since four years after the building was constructed and occupied. The study adopted a holistic approach to dampness surveying involving a two-stage protocol of damp investigation to identify the areas in the walls severely affected by dampness. Results from the visual survey (site inspection) identified symptoms such as blistering of paints, flaking of mortar, damp patches in horizontal bands, surface efflorescence and in some cases mold growth to be associated with <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. The findings showed that dampness in the building could be due to a combination of several sources including plumbing leakages, rain water splash back, lateral penetration and rising dampness. Results from the non-destructive tests revealed higher moisture contents in <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> (externally and internally), living room and bedrooms. The moisture content recorded in <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> were unusually higher than the other rooms and a detailed analysis revealed that plumbing leakage was a contributory factor, especially in the internal walls. Though the study identified plumbing leakages and water penetration as contributory factors to the dampness experienced in <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms,</b> further destructive tests are recommended for <b>the</b> confirmation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> true source(s) <b>of</b> dampness in <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bedrooms and living room to greatly assist in targeting the correct remediation to manage or cure the problem...|$|R

5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who apparently has ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that {{he had nothing to}} do with it, they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On the way out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E

40|$|Background: Liquefied {{petroleum}} gas geysers are used very frequently for heating water {{in developing countries}} such as India. However, these gas geysers emit various toxic gases; one among them is colorless, odorless carbon monoxide (CO). In the past few years, {{there were reports of}} unexplained loss <b>of</b> consciousness in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b> However, <b>the</b> exact cause for these episodes has been recognized as toxic encephalopathy due to toxic gases inhalation mainly CO. Objective: To analyze the clinical profile and outcome of patients brought with loss <b>of</b> consciousness in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> while bathing using gas geyser. Materials and Methods: Case records <b>of</b> patients with <b>the</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> gas geyser syndrome from 2013 to 2015 were retrieved and analyzed. Twenty-four cases were identified and included in the study. This was a retrospective, descriptive study. Results: Twenty-four patients were brought to our Emergency Department with loss <b>of</b> consciousness in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> while bathing. Twenty-one cases had loss of consciousness during bathing and recovered spontaneously. Two cases were found dead in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> and were brought to <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Forensic Medicine for postmortem. One case was brought in deep altered state of consciousness and succumbed to illness within 1 week. Conclusion: Awareness regarding CO intoxication due to usage of ill-fitted, ill-ventilated gas geyser is necessary as they are entirely preventable conditions...|$|R
500|$|Light and {{darkness}} feature prominently in Psycho. The first shot after the intertitle is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures.

The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness. Bright lights are also [...] "the ironic equivalent of darkness" [...] in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam's and Marion's hotel room, vehicle headlights at night, the neon sign at the Bates Motel, [...] "the glaring white" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar's exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman's mother.
