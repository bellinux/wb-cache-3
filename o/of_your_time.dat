500|$|Reviewers {{thought the}} {{expansion}} {{would be worth}} the player's investment if they enjoyed Fallout 4. Kirk McKeand (Eurogamer) said there are no real choices to make in Nuka-World, though it still may be worthy <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>time.</b> Kat Bailey (USgamer) liked the expansion, and {{thought there was a}} lot to do in it, but not all of it is interesting. She said the expansion [...] "could be worse, but it could also be a whole lot better", but if you enjoyed Fallout 4, then [...] "there's good reason to pick up Nuka-World." [...] Nic Rowen (Destructoid) noted fans of the genre will probably enjoy Nuka-World, but others will be left unsatisfied. [...] Tassi believed it was worth the $20. Andrew Webster finished his review by saying Nuka-World was only for dedicated players.|$|E
500|$|Despite Khan's {{enthusiasm for}} the idea of a sequel, the film {{industry}} expressed mixed opinions regarding it. Filmmaker Rajkumar Gupta commented, [...] "It would be challenging to take forward a story that has not worked earlier." [...] Producer Ramesh Taurani responded negatively to the idea, saying, [...] "It is important for the film to be appreciated so that a sequel can be made." [...] Trade analyst Atul Mohan called the sequel [...] "a bad idea." [...] Conversely, others were supportive of the sequel. Producer Goldie Behl brushed aside arguments about the success of the first film, saying, [...] "If the people think that they can earn some more, then it doesn't matter how big or small the hit was." [...] Director Kunal Kohli also reacted positively, saying, [...] "Certain ideas naturally lend themselves to sequels. So why not use that investment <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> and effort to make a sequel that will take the brand further?" ...|$|E
500|$|Maurice Tan of Destructoid {{highlighted}} the pacing and combat intensity, which requires players {{to pay attention}} to the flow of the battle more than usual. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot stated similar pros, especially during the second portion of the mission. According to him, [...] "enemies attack at just the right pace, so individual battles never drag on too long, nor are they over so quickly that they end up being unsatisfying." [...] He also {{highlighted the}} vehicle chase scene, comparing it favorably to Blade Runner and The Fifth Element, but criticize the controls in the Xbox 360 version for not being very precise. The bosses received similar praise, with Steimer stating that both of them [...] "have unique traits that make them a formidable opponent." [...] The Shadow Broker's base was highlighted as a valuable addition to the game. Whitehead noted that marking mineral-rich planets alleviates the scanning, which was seen as a tedious feature in the main game. VanOrd concluded that [...] "Lair of the Shadow Broker" [...] is [...] "worthy <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> (more than two hours) and your money." [...] The pack was nominated for Best DLC (downloadable content) at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, but lost to [...] It won the Inside Gaming Award for Best DLC.|$|E

2500|$|GameBoomers rated it an A-. They {{felt that}} {{although}} {{it was more of}} a straight [...] "horror game" [...] than either of the two previous Dark Fall games, it wasn't sufficiently scary. They also felt some of the puzzles were repetitive, although they praised the sound and plot. They concluded [...] "Dark Fall: Lost Souls is an excellent adventure game, worthy <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> and your money." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Seconds" [...] is a serious, sombre mood {{piece on}} the {{assassination}} of John F. Kennedy in 1963, {{and its impact on}} the wider world. [...] Where Oakey berates (the unnamed) Lee Harvey Oswald, characterised by the lyrics [...] "it took seconds <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> to take his life" [...] and [...] "a shot that was heard around the world". When played live the song is often accompanied by background slides of Kennedy. The song makes a feature of the voice assignment modes on the Roland Jupiter-4 synthesiser, alternating between strident two-note chords, with 2 VCOs per note, and thinner three note chords with 1 VCO per voice.|$|E
2500|$|Josh Rosenblatt of The Austin Chronicle {{enjoyed the}} film, calling it [...] "good, manic fun plus a {{heavy dose of}} {{political}} intrigue adding up to two hours of clamorous, mind-numbing nonsense," [...] calling it [...] "The Transporter 2 on crack." [...] William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer also gave Eagle Eye a positive review, remarking that it's [...] "engrossing as an intellectual puzzle" [...] and [...] "a solid thriller." [...] Mark Bell of Film Threat said: [...] "the film isn't a complete waste <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> [...] but don't expect anything brilliant." [...] Neely Tucker of The Washington Post said that Eagle Eye is [...] "sometimes entertaining" [...] but [...] "doesn't have much to say." [...] Robert Koehler of Variety felt that the film's [...] "first 35 minutes sizzle" [...] but [...] "the story [...] near-parody in the final act." ...|$|E

2500|$|Edge gave {{it one of}} {{its lowest}} scores, a 3 out of 10, saying [...] "The notion that playing games is a waste <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> is nonsense, of course, but... stuffed with a {{procession}} of long-winded loading sequences, protracted menu flipping and unskippable cutscenes, it often feels like there’s as much watching [...] as there is playing. Time wasted, in other words." [...] They criticized the many technical and graphical glitches, saying [...] "sometimes the lighting effects [...] mix textures into strange oily swirls, while at other times it feels like you’re driving one big polygon." [...] However, in the post script, they did concede that, while flawed, the game does have a clever concept and occasionally delivers those rare feelings of escapism that many arcade-style racers strive for: [...] "The Run may not have much else going for it, but in its unusual approach to the genre it at least tries to do something new." ...|$|E
