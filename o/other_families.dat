5|$|Dreyfus {{writes that}} after the Phagmodrupa lost its centralizing power over Tibet in 1434, several {{attempts}} by <b>other</b> <b>families</b> to establish hegemonies failed {{over the next two}} centuries until 1642 with the 5th Dalai Lama's effective hegemony over Tibet.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the {{inclusion}} of genera within Liliaceae has been extremely broad. Of the various published systems, {{one of the best}} known and also the broadest modern circumscription is the Cronquist system (1981), which included nearly 300 genera in Liliaceae. Most of these have been reassigned to <b>other</b> <b>families,</b> as shown in the following collapsed list, following ITIS, together with their disposition as APG III transfers to <b>other</b> <b>families</b> and subfamilies, within Liliales and three other orders, Alismatales, Asparagales and Dioscoreales. Current members of Liliaceae are shown in bold.|$|E

5|$|While the {{previous}} grouping had good morphological support, molecular studies do not corroborate the monophyly of this group. Previously Mysida included two <b>other</b> <b>families,</b> Lepidomysidae and Stygiomysidae, but these {{have now been}} placed in a separate order, Stygiomysida.|$|E

5|$|Blue {{whales are}} {{rorquals}} (family Balaenopteridae), {{a family that}} includes the humpback whale, the fin whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke whale. The family Balaenopteridae {{is believed to have}} diverged from the <b>other</b> <b>families</b> of the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Oligocene (28 Ma ago). It is not known when the members of those families diverged from each other.|$|E
5|$|Game of Thrones {{is roughly}} {{based on the}} storylines of A Song of Ice and Fire, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the {{continent}} of Essos.

It opens with additional threats in the icy North and Essos in the east.|$|E
5|$|Humpback {{whales are}} {{rorquals}} (Balaenopteridae, {{a family that}} includes the blue, fin, Bryde's, sei and minke whales).

5|$|On the one hand, {{there is}} little {{question}} that they are most closely related to three <b>other</b> <b>families</b> of streamlined, surface water fishes: the flyingfishes, needlefishes, and sauries. Traditionally, these four families {{have been taken to}} together comprise the order Beloniformes. The halfbeaks and flyingfishes are considered to form one group, the superfamily Exocoetoidea, and the needlefishes and sauries another, the superfamily Scomberesocoidea.|$|E
5|$|Planar graphs, and <b>other</b> <b>families</b> of sparse graphs, {{have been}} {{discussed}} above: they have linearly many maximal cliques, of bounded size, that can be listed in linear time. In particular, for planar graphs, any clique can have at most four vertices, by Kuratowski's theorem.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} {{most commonly}} adopted is that proposed by Beier in 1968. He divided the order into eight families. Klass, in 1997, studied the external male genitalia and postulated that the families Chaeteessidae and Metallyticidae diverged from the <b>other</b> <b>families</b> {{at an early}} date. However, the Mantidae and Thespidae are both polyphyletic, so the Mantodea {{will have to be}} revised.|$|E

5|$|All the {{families}} were formerly treated {{as part of}} a single order, Mecoptera. The relationships between {{the families}} are however a matter of debate. The cladogram, from Cracraft and Donoghue 2004, places the Nannochoristidae as a separate order, with the Boreidae, sister to the Siphonaptera, also as its own order. The Eomeropidae is suggested to be sister {{to the rest of the}} Mecoptera, with the position of the Bittacidae unclear. Of those <b>other</b> <b>families,</b> the Meropeidae is the most basal, and the relationships of the rest not completely clear.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs are {{abundant}} {{and can be}} found throughout the Americas and Eurasia. The common earwig was introduced into North America in 1907 from Europe, but tends to be more common in the southern and southwestern parts of the United States. The only native species of earwig found in the north of the United States is the spine-tailed earwig (Doru aculeatum), found as far north as Canada, where it hides in the leaf axils of emerging plants in southern Ontario wetlands. However, <b>other</b> <b>families</b> can be found in North America, including Forficulidae (Doru and Forficula being found there), Spongiphoridae, Anisolabididae, and Labiduridae.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying {{takes two}} {{different}} forms {{depending on the}} species. The female in some families has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant {{on or near the}} water, so she can push her eggs inside. In <b>other</b> <b>families</b> such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping {{the surface of the water}} repeatedly with her abdomen, by shaking the eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation. In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water, and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.|$|E

5|$|Fixed {{gender roles}} began to become less {{prominent}} in the Western world starting in the late 20th century, allowing men {{to make their own}} choice of career without regard to traditional gender-based roles. Some men who choose this role may do so because they enjoy being an active part of their children's lives, while in <b>other</b> <b>families,</b> the mother wants to pursue her career. For example, of the 187 participants at Fortune Magazine's Most Powerful Women in the Business Summit, one third of the women's husbands were stay-at-home dads.|$|E
5|$|In April 1784, the Rowans {{and five}} <b>other</b> <b>families</b> {{set out for}} a tract of land on the Long Falls of the Green River that Rowan had {{purchased}} before leaving Pennsylvania. The party arrived on May 11, 1784, and constructed a fort which they dubbed Fort Vienna. The fort, then located approximately 100 {{miles from the nearest}} white settlement, is the present-day town of Calhoun. The settlers at Fort Vienna frequently clashed with the Shawnee who used the area as a hunting ground. The Rowans would remain at Fort Vienna for six years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>families</b> {{claiming}} {{descent from}} his nephews are spread through Stara Raška and Šumadija in Serbia. There was a tale that Pivljanin put a curse {{on his family}} after seven of his brothers and cousins declined {{to join him in}} the hajduks. The Markovići brotherhood in Ljuljaci, Serbia, with the slava of St. John, settled {{in the first half of}} the 18th century, descending from one of Pivljanin's children. The Bajić brotherhood in Takovo, with the slava of St. George, numbering 30 households in 1960, also claim descent from him.|$|E
