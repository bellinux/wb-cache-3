5|$|At dawn on August 11, one 300-man {{battalion}} of the 766th Regiment entered {{the village of}} P'ohang, creating a state <b>of</b> <b>alarm</b> among its populace. The village was only protected by a small force of South Korean Navy, Air Force and Army personnel comprising the rear guard of the ROK 3rd Division. The South Korean forces engaged the 766th forces around the village's middle school with small-arms fire until noon. At that point, North Korean armored vehicles moved in to reinforce the 766th troops and drove the South Koreans out of the village.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{produce a}} number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, {{grunting}} or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times <b>of</b> <b>alarm,</b> excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{overwhelming}} number <b>of</b> <b>alarms</b> {{generated by}} rule-based network intrusion detection systems makes {{the task of}} network security operators ineffective. Preliminary results on an approach called EXOLAP shows that false positives alarms can be avoided by detecting changes on the stream <b>of</b> <b>alarms</b> using a data cube and median polish procedure. A data cube aggregates alarms by hierarchical time frames, rule number, target port number and other feature attributes. The median polish procedure is used on materialized relational views of the data cube to detect changes on the stream <b>of</b> <b>alarms.</b> EXOLAP shows promising results on labeled and unlabeled test sets by focusing on exceptions on the normal stream <b>of</b> <b>alarms,</b> diverting the attention away from false positives. ...|$|R

5|$|Red wattlebirds utter {{two types}} <b>of</b> <b>alarm</b> calls, {{alternating}} between them while mobbing other animals. One is a harsh call {{over a wide}} frequency (1.3 to 5.9kHz) that is louder at lower frequencies. The other a lower-pitched staccato call with a frequency of 1.1–2.2kHz. They give a harsh call when trying to distract intruders from {{the vicinity of the}} nest or when picked up, often trying to flap or peck the handler.|$|E

5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have a wide range <b>of</b> <b>alarm</b> calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of}} the precise threat. The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E
5|$|On July 29 the 1st Battalion {{suffered}} {{about 60}} casualties from North Korean mortar fire.

He had to personally reorganize the battalion as many of his officers were unable to get the men to listen to them. As White tried to rally his men, the field artillery maintained a sustained barrage of fire to slow the North Koreans advance. That night alone the artillery fired 3,000 rounds in holding back the North Koreans.|$|E

5|$|All lemurs {{experience}} some predation pressure. Common defenses against predation {{include the use}} <b>of</b> <b>alarm</b> calls and predator mobbing, mostly among diurnal lemurs. The leaping abilities of lemurs may have evolved for predator avoidance rather than for travel, {{according to a study}} in kinematics. Nocturnal lemurs are difficult to see and track at night and decrease their visibility by foraging alone. They also try to avoid predators by using concealing sleeping locations, such as nests, tree holes, or dense vegetation, Some may also avoid areas frequented by predators by detecting the smell of their feces. and alternating between multiple sleeping locations. Even torpor and hibernation states among cheirogaleids may be partly due to high levels of predation. Infants are protected while foraging by either leaving them in the nest or by stashing them in a hidden location, where the infant remains immobile {{in the absence of the}} parent.|$|E

5|$|The {{antelope}} is shy and elusive. When alarmed, {{it stands}} motionless and may nervously leap {{away from the}} danger or even sprint. It often conceals itself in tall grasses to escape predators. The use <b>of</b> <b>alarm</b> calls to alert others is not common because the antelope tries to avoid the attention of predators. However, in extreme cases, these calls {{may be used to}} warn predators that they have been identified. Adults mark vegetation in their territories with a colourless secretion of preorbital glands, that soon condenses to form a white film. They maintain multiple latrine sites where piles of their pellet droppings are formed by regular use. Latrine sites can be confused with those of the barking deer but the pellets are longer and larger in four-horned antelopes. Submissive display consists of shrinking the body, lowering the head and pulling the ears back. Predators of four-horned antelopes include tigers, leopards, and dholes.|$|E

5|$|Polistes exclamans exhibit {{an alarm}} response, {{typical of many}} higher level eusocial Hymenoptera. Although it has been {{previously}} indicated that nest mates may alarm {{the rest of the}} nest through jerky movement and buzzing of wings, Polistes exclamans is capable of alarming the rest of the nest and attracting attacking wasps through chemical means by releasing a non-species-specific venomous alarm pheromone. Although a chemical signal to warn against attack would be evolutionarily adaptive, the Polistes exclamans only releases a response post the initial attack from and on the predator, as the venom is only released during the sting. This venom is capable of warning and coordinating a response from the nest and attracting nearby heterospecific or conspecific females from nearby colonies to attack the predator. This helps deter the predator from further attacking and is especially adaptive for the defense of the nest. Although certain other insects have been able to adapt the release of the pheromone to other means of communicating alarm, Polistes exclamans has yet to do so, indicating that it is still in its “primitive state in evolution of the complex systems of communication <b>of</b> <b>alarm</b> seen in higher social insects.” In one experiment, pheromones were extracted from female glands and sacs and were spread onto venom paper. It was then found that females were attracted upwind of the venom paper and some even attempted to sting it. This also had a heterospecific response where others also reacted to it. While it was found that one wasp couldn’t release enough pheromones to elicit a response, if many individuals were alarmed they would elicit a response {{from the rest of the}} nest. However, this scent is not strong enough to reach other nests, and so neighboring nests must be alarmed by physical movements and wing flapping.|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: Febrile {{children}} {{in primary care}} have a low risk for serious infection. Although several alarming signs and symptoms are proposed to have predictive value for serious infections, most are based on research in secondary care. The frequency <b>of</b> <b>alarming</b> signs/symptoms has not been established in primary care; however, in this setting differences in occurrence may influence their predictive value for serious infections. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency <b>of</b> <b>alarming</b> signs/symptoms in febrile {{children in}} primary care. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. Clinical information was registered in a semi-structured way and manually recoded. SETTING: General practitioners' out-of-hours service. SUBJECTS: Face-to-face patient contacts concerning children (aged ≤ 16 years) with fever were eligible for inclusion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency <b>of</b> 18 <b>alarming</b> signs and symptoms {{as reported in the}} literature. RESULTS: A total of 10, 476 patient contacts were included. The frequency <b>of</b> <b>alarming</b> signs/symptoms ranged from n =  1 (ABC instability; 40 °C as reported by the parents; 12. 9 %) to 8, 647 contacts (parental concern; 82. 5 %). CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence <b>of</b> specific <b>alarming</b> signs/symptoms is low in primary care, ≥ 50 % of children have one or more alarming signs/symptoms. There is a need to determine the predictive value <b>of</b> <b>alarming</b> signs/symptoms not only for serious infections in primary care, but as well for increased risk of a complicated course of the illness...|$|R

Methods : A risk analysis was performed before implementation. Alarms from patient monitors recorded for a year were identified, classified and counted. The first alarms, which went to the nurse responsible for the patient, were distinguished from the repeat alarms that were generated if the nurse failed to respond within 45 sec. Results : The alarm handling protocol was changed as staff felt they needed a greater overview <b>of</b> the NICU <b>alarms</b> to avoid risks. In 1 year, 222 751 critical alarms including 12 309 repeat alarms were generated by patient monitors, equivalent to two alarms per patient per hour.

40|$|An {{alarm system}} is a vital {{component}} of any accelerator, as it provides a warning that some element {{of the system is}} not functioning properly. The severity and age <b>of</b> the <b>alarm</b> may sometimes signify whether urgent or deferred attention is required. For example, older alarms may be given a lower priority if an assumption is made that someone else is already investigating it, whereas those of higher severity or alarms that are more current may indicate the need for an immediate response. The alarm history also provides valuable information regarding the functionality of the overall system, thus careful tracking of these data is likely to improve response time, remove uncertainty about the current status and assist in the ability to promptly respond to the same warning/trigger in the future.
