40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a kit for converting a spark-ignition engine installed on small-size generators in order to allow their functioning with multiple fuels, with particular reference to low-boiling-point fuels. The kit can be easily added to technological systems which have been on the market for a long time. In addition, depending on the local conditions of use, operation in cogeneration is also possible, which increases the total efficiency of such generators. The solution developed is technically simple, robust, reliable and versatile, since it can be fed with different fuels, and it can be used both for grid-connected and off-grid applications, with particular reference to the developing Countries. The results of the first phase of technical development of the system and the experimental tests carried out with LPG and bioethanol are hereby presented. They attest the feasibility of using the conversion kit in a commercial power unit and they demonstrate that the actual performances are broadly consistent with the calculated results. The overall efficiency (electric and thermal) of the prototype system reaches a value close to 40 % in conditions of rated load, almost doubling the generation efficiency of the system before its conversion. Any further developments of the research will be dedicated to better investigate also the environmental and economic aspects of the kit in different operating contexts, as well as to test <b>other</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>fuels...</b>|$|E
40|$|Transient {{modeling}} {{and analysis of}} advanced Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustion (PFBC) systems is a research area that is currently {{under investigation by the}} US Department of Energy`s Federal Energy Technology Center (FETC). The object of the effort is to identify key operating parameters that affect plant performance and then quantify the basic response of major sub-systems to changes in operating conditions. PC-TRAX{trademark}, a commercially available dynamic software program, was chosen and applied in this {{modeling and}} analysis effort. This paper describes the development of a series of TRAX-based transient models of advanced PFBC power plants. These power plants burn coal or <b>other</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>fuel</b> in a PFBC, and the high temperature flue gas supports low-Btu fuel gas or natural gas combustion in a gas turbine topping combustor. When it is utilized, the low-Btu fuel gas is produced in a bubbling bed carbonizer. High temperature, high pressure combustion products exiting the topping combustor are expanded in a modified gas turbine to generate electrical power. Waste heat from the system is used to raise and superheat steam for a reheat steam turbine bottoming cycle that generates additional electrical power. Basic control/instrumentation models were developed and modeled in PC-TRAX and used to investigate off-design plant performance. System performance for various transient conditions and control philosophies was studied...|$|R

50|$|An Oxyliquit, {{also called}} liquid air {{explosive}} or liquid oxygen explosive, is an explosive material {{which is a}} mixture of liquid oxygen (LOX) with a <b>suitable</b> <b>fuel,</b> such as carbon (as lampblack), or an organic chemical (e.g. a mixture of soot and naphthalene), wood meal, or aluminium powder or sponge.

5000|$|Panclastites are a {{class of}} Sprengel {{explosives}} similar to oxyliquits. They were first suggested in 1881 by Eugène Turpin, a French chemist. They are a mixture of liquid dinitrogen tetroxide serving as oxidizer with a <b>suitable</b> <b>fuel,</b> e.g. carbon disulfide, in the 3:2 volume ratio. http://www.webref.org/geology/p/panclastite.htm Other fuel being used is nitrobenzene.

40|$|Due to {{the toxic}} nature of common {{high-performance}} rocket propellant combinations (such as monomethyl-hydrazine/di-nitrogen tetroxide), {{there is now}} growing interest in so-called 'green' propellants. In response to this, and in the continuation of existing research, a small demonstration bi-propellant rocket-engine was designed, built and tested using homogeneous catalysis of highly stabilised hydrogen peroxide. An investigation into <b>suitable</b> <b>fuels</b> was conducted, and candidates selected. Auto-ignition was successfully achieved, demonstrating the robustness of the propellant combination...|$|R

50|$|The {{envelope}} of the dirigible was rendered airtight {{by means of}} an internal rubber coating, with a thinner film on the outside. Syngas, used for inflation, formed a <b>suitable</b> <b>fuel</b> for the engine, but limited the height to which the dirigible could ascend. Such trials as were made were carried out with the dirigible held captive. A full experiment was prevented because funds ran low, but Haenlein's work constituted a distinct advance on all that had been done previously.|$|R
