5000|$|<b>Overhead</b> <b>cabling</b> - cables are {{installed}} on the ceiling. Cable drop downs give users access to outlets.|$|E
5000|$|Some power cabling is also direct-buried. This kind of cabling {{must follow}} strict {{regulatory}} procedures regarding installation [...] and backfilling. This is usually used for undergrounding {{in areas where}} <b>overhead</b> <b>cabling</b> is impractical or dangerous.|$|E
50|$|A few {{isolated}} tram rails {{remain in}} place, {{along with some}} of the <b>overhead</b> <b>cabling.</b> Many of the supporting poles have found alternative uses as mounting posts for street lights. A few of the historical tramcars are used as street cafes.|$|E

50|$|Within the Telecom Solutions {{business}} unit, Prysmian Group {{also produces}} copper cables for underground and <b>overhead</b> <b>cabling</b> solutions and for both {{residential and commercial}} buildings.

50|$|It {{occupies}} a sand-filled area of approximately 1,630,000 square metres and {{is divided into}} 536 plots (of between 1000 and 4000 square metres in size) mainly arranged along cul-de-sacs, so designed to enhance the historically residential nature of Ikoyi. Residents are provided with world class utilities including underground electrical systems (versus the <b>overhead</b> <b>cabling</b> common throughout Lagos), an underground water supply network, a central sewage system and treatment plant, and street lighting and satellite telecommunications networks.|$|E
50|$|Although Werner von Siemens {{demonstrated}} the electric tram in 1881 at the International Electrical Exhibition in Paris, {{it was not}} until 1890 that the first électric tram was opened in Clermont-Ferrand, and in 1895 the Tramway de Versailles was converted from steam power to electric power. While electricity offered considerable benefits including ease of operation, many municipalities were reluctant to bring <b>overhead</b> <b>cabling</b> into their city centres. Nevertheless, over the next 15 years, well over 100 standard and small gauge electric tram networks came into operation.|$|E

5000|$|A new {{approach}} to the inter-rack cabling was taken. A false ceiling was built above {{the top of the}} racks, creating a cable loft. The cables were just pushed through holes in the cable loft and taken to where they were going by the shortest route. The holes were sealed after all the cables had been put in place, as a fire precaution. The result was a complete mess of a cable loft, but all cables were labelled; it was quicker and easier than the normal way of lacing all the cables. The exchange was housed in a prototype K-type single-story building having a special provision reinforced ceiling for the <b>overhead</b> <b>cabling</b> already mentioned. The construction included thermal insulation panels and double-glazing to minimise heat loss, and heating was by under-floor electrical heaters operated on off-peak supplies. Ventilation arrangements were by eight ventilating units, each handling 600 cu. ft. per min, and a series of [...] "hit-and-miss"-type louvers above the windows {{on each side of the}} building provided outlets for heated air.|$|E

50|$|Technically, {{the ferry}} is a {{reaction}} ferry, which is propelled {{by the current}} of the water. An <b>overhead</b> <b>cable</b> is suspended from towers anchored on either bank of the river. The ferry is attached to this <b>overhead</b> <b>cable</b> by bridle cables and pulleys. To operate the ferry, it is angled into the current, causing {{the force of the}} current to move the ferry across the river.|$|R

25|$|The Nord-Sud company {{lines were}} powered through <b>overhead</b> <b>cables,</b> whereas the third rail system was in {{use on the}} CMP's network. With the {{ownership}} transition, the CMP standard was adopted on the lines 12 and 13. As a result, the <b>overhead</b> <b>cables</b> of the Nord-Sud were decommissioned in 1932, one year after those of line 13. Pantographs continued {{to be used in}} the Vaugirard workshop. To improve the connection of the lines and facilitate the transfer of the carriages, a new link was built in 1935, between the Montparnasse station and the Vavin station of line 4.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{reaction}} ferries operate {{using an}} <b>overhead</b> <b>cable</b> suspended from towers anchored on either {{bank of the}} river. Others use a floating cable attached to a single anchorage that may be on one bank or mid-channel. Where an <b>overhead</b> <b>cable</b> is used a [...] "traveller" [...] is usually installed on the cable and the ferry {{is attached to the}} traveller by a bridle cable. To operate the ferry either the bridle cable is adjusted or a rudder is used, causing the ferry to be angled into the current, and the force of the current moves the ferry across the river.|$|R
50|$|Twenty {{miles of}} <b>overhead</b> <b>cable</b> were also erected from Cranstal south to Ramsey, {{and on to}} Douglas. In England, the {{telegraph}} was connected to Whitehaven and the circuits of the Electric Telegraph Company.|$|R
50|$|Continuous {{welded rail}} is {{generally}} {{used to reduce}} track vibrations and misalignment. Almost all high-speed lines are electrically driven via <b>overhead</b> <b>cables,</b> have in-cab signalling, and use advanced switches using very low entry and frog angles.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this theses is arch bridge design over the expressway. Bridge is consist of bridge deck, which has three pillars and composite arc. The Bridge deck is on the edges fixed into the foundations {{and in the middle}} adherent on <b>overhead</b> <b>cables.</b> The bridge is carried by combination of strands and aerial cables mounted on reinforced concrete arch. <b>Overhead</b> <b>cables</b> are slant due to the transverse direction of the bridge in the longitudinal direction is {{in the direction of the}} arc.

50|$|In heavily {{populated}} {{regions of the}} UK, the only <b>overhead</b> <b>cable</b> that would be visible is the telephone line. Power cables and fiber-optic cables that deliver television and broadband services are buried underground. The lesser populated regions of the UK, the countryside for example, will have <b>overhead</b> power <b>cables.</b> Although it is safer to keep the cables underground, {{it would be difficult}} to repair a line if a fault was to develop.|$|R
