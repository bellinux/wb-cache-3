5|$|Impala feed <b>on</b> <b>soft</b> and nutritious grasses such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall grasses, such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are {{typically}} avoided. Impala {{on the periphery}} of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E
5|$|The Kerry Bog Pony is a {{mountain}} and moorland breed of pony that originated in Ireland. Possibly {{descended from the}} Irish Hobby horse, it originally lived a mainly feral existence in the peat bogs {{of what is now}} County Kerry in southwestern Ireland. Local inhabitants used the ponies as pack and cart horses for transporting peat and kelp to the villages. The breed developed physical characteristics including a low weight-to-height ratio and an unusual footfall pattern, which helped it move <b>on</b> <b>soft</b> ground such as peat bogs. The ponies were known for hardiness and an ability to survive in harsh conditions.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop {{lives on}} the seabed in the sublittoral zone between low tide mark and a depth of , <b>on</b> <b>soft</b> {{sediment}} or on rock, particularly in areas with a strong current. It is a filter feeder, sieving microscopic algae from water that passes through its gills. It is preyed on by starfish, octopuses and sea otters. It can detect predators by smell and by sight and can swim away from them by opening and closing its valves. Other organisms often grow on the exterior of its shell and it often forms a symbiotic relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on the upper valve and helps protect it from predators.|$|E

5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more energy {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient <b>on</b> <b>soft</b> terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} new keeps {{constructed}} in France, these Anglo-Norman designs were informed both by military thinking and by political drivers. The keep at Orford has been particularly extensively analysed in this regard, and although traditional explanations suggested that its unusual plan {{was the result of}} an experimental military design, more recent analysis concludes that the design was instead probably driven by political symbolism and the need for Henry to dominate the contested lands of East Anglia. The architecture would, for mid-12th century nobility, have summoned up images of King Arthur or Constantinople, then the idealised versions of royal and imperial power. Even formidable military designs such as that at Château Gaillard were built with political effect in mind. Gaillard was designed to reaffirm Angevin authority in a fiercely disputed conflict zone and the keep, although militarily impressive, contained only an anteroom and a royal audience chamber, and was built <b>on</b> <b>soft</b> chalk and without an internal well, both serious defects from a defensive perspective.|$|E
5|$|Often {{considered}} by commentators {{to be the}} benchmark against which other batsmen are compared for attractive, graceful batting, Palairet won many plaudits for his style. In his book, The Jubilee Book of Cricket, Ranjitsinhji includes a number of staged photographs of Palairet playing his shots, and describes his methods in places, using them as the model which young players should adopt. He played predominantly off the front foot, and tended to be less effective <b>on</b> <b>soft</b> pitches. He favoured shots on the off side, particularly the off drive and cover drive. During Palairet's career, bowlers favoured a tactic, known as off theory, of bowling the ball just outside the off stump. The strength of Palairet's off side strokes helped him to score effectively against this tactic. Fry suggests that the early practice that Palairet gained against Attewell and Martin, who bowled accurately at the stumps, was {{a key factor in}} limiting his range of leg side shots. He favoured lofted shots which were often compared to golf strokes.|$|E

40|$|B cells use B-cell receptors (BCRs) {{to sense}} antigens {{that are usually}} {{presented}} on substrates with different stiffness. However, {{it is not known}} how substrate stiffness affects B-cell proliferation, class switch, and in vivo antibody responses. We addressed these questions using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates with different stiffness (20 or 1100 kPa). Live cell imaging experiments suggested that antigens on stiffer substrates more efficiently trigger the synaptic accumulation of BCR and phospho-Syk molecules compared with antigens <b>on</b> <b>softer</b> substrates. In vitro expansion of mouse primary B cells shows different preferences for substrate stiffness when stimulated by different expansion stimuli. LPS equally drives B-cell proliferation <b>on</b> stiffer or <b>softer</b> substrates. Anti-CD 40 antibodies enhance B-cell proliferation on stiffer substrates, while antigens enhance B-cell proliferation <b>on</b> <b>softer</b> substrates through a mechanism involving the enhanced phosphorylation of PI 3 K, Akt, and FoxO 1. In vitro class switch differentiation of B cells prefers softer substrates. Lastly, NP 67 -Ficoll <b>on</b> <b>softer</b> substrates accounted for an enhanced antibody response in vivo. Thus, substrate stiffness regulates B-cell activation, proliferation, class switch, and T cell independent antibody responses in vivo, suggesting its broad application in manipulating the fate of B cells in vitro and in vivo...|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{member of}} the family Equidae was the Hyracotherium, which lived between 45 and 55million years ago, during the Eocene period. It had 4toes on each front foot, and 3toes on each back foot. The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the Mesohippus, which lived 32 to 37million years ago. Over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished. All that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee, known informally as splint bones. Their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed. By about 5million years ago, the modern Equus had evolved. Equid teeth also evolved from browsing <b>on</b> <b>soft,</b> tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of Eurasia and the Great Plains of North America.|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking <b>on</b> <b>soft</b> surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to walking over metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{the spotted}} green pigeon was not recorded, but theories {{have been proposed}} based on its physical features. Gibbs found the delicate, part-feathered legs and long tail indicative of at least partially arboreal habits. After noting that the wings were not short after all, van Grouw stated that the bird {{would not have been}} terrestrial, unlike the related Nicobar pigeon. He pointed out that the overall proportions and shape of the bird (longer tail, shorter legs, primary feathers probably reaching the middle of the tail) was more similar to the pigeons of the genus Ducula. It may therefore have been ecologically similar to those birds, have likewise been strongly arboreal, and kept to the dense canopy of forests. By contrast, the mainly terrestrial Nicobar pigeon forages on the forest floor. The dark eyes of the Nicobar pigeon are typical of species that forage on forest floors, whereas the coloured bill and presumably coloured eyes of the spotted green pigeon {{are similar to those of}} frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons. The feet of the spotted green pigeon are also similar to those of pigeons that forage in trees. The slender bill indicates that it fed <b>on</b> <b>soft</b> fruits.|$|E

5|$|All fifteen Hamilcars which {{participated in}} the first lift on 17 September arrived over the landing zones safely, but {{problems}} were experienced {{when they came in}} to land. Two of the gliders landed <b>on</b> <b>soft</b> ground, which caused them to rapidly decelerate; this, combined with the majority of their equipment being {{in the front of the}} gliders, resulted in them flipping onto their backs. Three of the pilots were killed and the fourth was badly wounded and later taken prisoner, and several passengers were wounded; the 17-pounder anti-tank guns on board the gliders were damaged beyond repair. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully, although one overran the landing zone and hit a railway embankment; this damaged the two Universal Carriers being carried by the glider, although both were later salvaged. The lift on 18 September was delayed for several hours due to poor weather conditions, and the glider force did not take off until approximately 11:00. En route to the landing zones, one Hamilcar was forced to cast off and land at an airfield in England after its tow aircraft developed engine trouble, and another ditched in the English Channel when its tug developed engine troubles as well; both had been carrying 17-pounder anti-tank guns. The rest of the Hamilcars encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire as they landed, with several being hit. As a result, one Hamilcar landed short of the landing zone after being hit in the wing, and another was forced to make an emergency landing far from the landing zone after being hit; the stores, pilots and passengers were captured by German forces shortly after the glider landed. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully. The third lift on 19 September did not take place due to weather problems, and because several of 1st Airborne Division's landing zones had been overrun. Finally on 21 September the weather cleared, but due to 1st Airborne Division's deteriorating situation it was decided that the 878th Aviation Engineer Battalion would not be delivered. As such, only a single Hamilcar accompanied 1st Polish Independent Parachute Brigade when it set off for its drop near the town of Driel; this was the same Hamilcar which had been forced to land in England on 19 September when its tug had experienced engine trouble. However, the tow rope between the glider and tug snapped over Belgium, and it was forced to land near Ghent.|$|E
