5|$|By Tuesday, {{the storm}} was rapidly moving across eastern Canada. Without the warm lake waters, it lost power quickly. This also meant less snowfall, both because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> motion of the storm {{and the lack of}} lake effect snow. All {{shipping}} was halted on Monday and part of Tuesday along the St. Lawrence River around Montreal, Quebec.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the general}} method {{to compute the}} inverse square root was to {{calculate}} an approximation for , then revise that approximation via another method until it came within an acceptable error range of the actual result. Common software methods in the early 1990s drew approximations from a lookup table. The key <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> inverse square root was to directly compute an approximation by utilizing the structure of floating-point numbers, proving faster than table lookups. The algorithm was approximately four times faster than computing the square root with another method and calculating the reciprocal via floating point division. The algorithm was designed with the IEEE 754-1985 32-bit floating point specification in mind, but investigation from Chris Lomont showed {{that it could be}} implemented in other floating point specifications.|$|E

5|$|Fast Five is {{the ninth}} highest-grossing 2011 film, the third highest-grossing film <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> and Furious {{franchise}} (behind Fast 6 and Furious 7) {{and the fifth}} highest-grossing Universal film. It was initially released in Australia on Wednesday, April 20, 2011– nine days before the release date in North America– followed by releases in the UK, South Korea and New Zealand. The earlier start in these countries was timed to coincide with their Easter holidays and avoided competition from forthcoming summer films, although this placed it in direct competition with Thor in some countries. By {{the end of its}} opening weekend, the film had accrued a total of $23.4 million from these countries. On its second weekend, Fast Five earned $46.3 million across 3,139 theaters in 14 countries, ranking first at the box office in each of its ten new markets. For the overall weekend, it ranked second behind Thor. In the third weekend of release, Fast Five topped the box office in a further 44 countries, playing in a total of 6,979 theaters across 58 countries. It ranked first during the weekend with $85.8 million. It set an opening-weekend record in the United Arab Emirates ($1.65 million), holding this record for two weeks before being out-grossed by Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides ($2.24 million).|$|E
5|$|For MacArthur's long-awaited {{return to}} the Philippines in October 1944, the Seventh Fleet was massively {{reinforced}} by Nimitz's Pacific Fleet. Kinkaid commanded the assault personally, with Barbey's VII Amphibious Force as Task Force 78, joined by Vice Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson's III Amphibious Force from the Pacific Fleet as Task Force 79. Kinkaid was also given Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's Task Force 77.2, a bombardment force built around six old battleships that had survived the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague's Task Force 77.4, a force of escort carriers. However, Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's Task Force 38, the covering force <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> carriers and battleships, remained part of Admiral Halsey's Third Fleet, which was not under MacArthur or Kinkaid's command.|$|E

25|$|The {{result was}} a ten-year capital plan which had been crafted by the government. It {{bypassed}} leasing a fast ferry for trials in BC waters and went directly to implementation. Several other projects previously considered essential, such as replacing one of the northern ferries, were deferred in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> ferries. In addition, the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> ferries {{would be used to}} revitalise the province's shipbuilding industry, furthering policy goals beyond merely improving ferry service to Nanaimo. The BC Ferries board, which was required to rubberstamp the plan, noted several concerns about the fast ferry aspect when asking the cabinet to give it final approval.|$|E
