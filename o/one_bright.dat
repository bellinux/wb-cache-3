5|$|Nixon {{wanted to}} get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been {{appointed}} by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who might win the seat. Nixon did not want to be seen as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he made it clear he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign trail for the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, <b>one</b> <b>bright</b> spot was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.|$|E

25|$|There is <b>one</b> <b>bright</b> {{planetary}} nebula in Centaurus, NGC 3918, {{also known as}} the Blue Planetary. It has an overall magnitude of 8.0 and a central star of magnitude 11.0; it is 2600 light-years from Earth. The Blue Planetary was discovered by John Herschel and named for its color's similarity to Uranus, though the nebula is apparently three times larger than the planet.|$|E
25|$|The 2008–09 season saw the Oilers {{finish with}} a record of 38–35–9, but that was only good enough for 11th in the West. <b>One</b> <b>bright</b> spot during the season, however, was Oilers goaltender Dwayne Roloson, as he became the oldest goalie to play 60 NHL games in one season. After the season, the Oilers fired Head Coach Craig MacTavish and hired Pat Quinn as his replacement.|$|E

25|$|The 1991–92 season {{turned out}} to be one to forget for the Centennials and their fans as the team {{stumbled}} to a record of 19–36–5 and fell to last place in the Interior Division and the BCJHL with 43 points. It was the first time in seven years that Merritt missed the BCJHL playoffs. <b>One</b> <b>bright</b> spot for the Cents was the play of rookie Mike Josephson, who was rewarded with the Interior Division rookie of the year award.|$|E
25|$|NGC 6193 is an {{open cluster}} {{containing}} approximately 30 stars with an overall magnitude of 5.0 and a size of 0.25 square degrees, about {{half the size of}} the full Moon.

NGC 6193 is surrounded by NGC 6188, a faint nebula only normally visible in long-exposure photographs.|$|E
25|$|Canada {{finished}} second in Round 4 of the Americas 1999 Rugby World Cup qualifying, losing only to Argentina, and qualify for the World Cup. Canada finished third in their pool (with France, Fiji and Namibia), winning their match against Namibia but losing their other two fixtures. The victory against Namibia was uncharacteristic for Canada, as they ran the score up to 72–11, {{one of their most}} lopsided victories, as there was a very slight statistical chance that they could have advanced on points scored. This trashing was the <b>one</b> <b>bright</b> light in an otherwise gloomy and disappointing 1999 World Cup performance.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>bright</b> {{spot in the}} {{otherwise}} bleak job market was Kaiser Permanente's decision to relocate some administrative offices near the Burbank airport. The relocation from Kaiser's Glendale and Pasadena administrative offices to Burbank was completed in 2009. More recently, eSolar moved offices from Old Town Pasadena to Burbank and continues to add positions. In 2011, General Electric agreed to invest $40 million in the solar company. Additionally, KCET television announced plans in 2012 to relocate to Burbank's Media District. KCET is a former PBS station and the nation's largest independent station in southern and central California.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{departure}} of Don Jonas, Sam Weir, who was the head coach at Lake Howell High School, became UCF's new head coach and led the Knights in their move up to Division II in 1982. Another change to the university's athletic programs in 1982 was {{the departure}} of O'Leary as athletic director, and the hiring of Bill Peterson, who was the Florida State head coach from 1960–70. In their first season playing Division II ball, the Knights went 0–10, and Weir decided not to return for the 1983 season. <b>One</b> <b>bright</b> spot of the season was that Mike Carter became the first Knight to sign with an NFL team, the Denver Broncos.|$|E
25|$|Mike Brearley, {{the captain}} Botham had replaced, resumed the reins {{for the third}} Test, at Headingley. This started out very badly: Australia scored 401 (John Dyson 102; Kim Hughes 89; but Botham took 6–95), and asked England to follow on after bowling them out for 174 (Lillee took 4 for 49; Lawson 3 for 32). The <b>one</b> <b>bright</b> point in the innings came from Botham, who top scored with 50 (his first since he had been made captain 13 matches earlier). In the second innings, Botham came to the crease with England on 105 for 5, still 126 behind. Matters did not improve: Geoffrey Boycott and Bob Taylor soon followed, and with England 135 for 7 and still 92 runs behind an innings defeat looked likely.|$|E

25|$|Boötes is {{in a part}} of the {{celestial}} sphere facing away from the plane of our home Milky Way galaxy, and so does not have open clusters or nebulae. Instead, it has <b>one</b> <b>bright</b> globular cluster and many faint galaxies. The globular cluster NGC 5466 has an overall magnitude of 9.1 and a diameter of 11 arcminutes. It is a very loose globular cluster with fairly few stars and may appear as a rich, concentrated open cluster in a telescope. NGC 5466 is classified as a Shapley-Sawyer Concentration Class 12 cluster, reflecting its sparsity. Its fairly large diameter means that it has a low surface brightness, so it appears far dimmer than the catalogued magnitude of 9.1 and requires a large amateur telescope to view. Only approximately 12 stars are resolved by an amateur instrument.|$|E
25|$|Chelsea {{were unable}} to build on their title success, and {{finished}} a disappointing 16th the following season. The team was aging and there followed a succession of uninspiring mid-table finishes; <b>one</b> <b>bright</b> spot in this period was {{the emergence of the}} prolific goalscorer Jimmy Greaves, who scored 122 league goals in four seasons. Along with Greaves, a series of other promising youngsters, informally known as Drake's Ducklings, emerged in the first team, though their inexperience ensured that performances remained erratic. One of the lowest points for the club in this period was being knocked out of the FA Cup in the 3rd round by Fourth Division side, Crewe Alexandra, in January 1961. When Greaves was sold to Milan in June 1961 the writing was on the wall and, without his goals, results slumped. Drake was sacked in September after a 4–0 loss to Blackpool with Chelsea bottom of the league table. He was replaced by 33-year-old player-coach Tommy Docherty.|$|E
25|$|Hydra has <b>one</b> <b>bright</b> binary star, Epsilon Hydrae, {{which is}} {{difficult}} to split in amateur telescopes; it has a period of 1000 years and is 135 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 3.4 and the secondary is a blue star of magnitude 6.7. However, there are several dimmer double stars and binary stars in Hydra. 27 Hydrae is a triple star with two components visible in binoculars and three visible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a white star of magnitude 4.8, 244 light-years from Earth. The secondary, a binary star, appears in binoculars at magnitude 7.0 but is composed of a magnitude 7 and a magnitude 11 star; it is 202 light-years from Earth. 54 Hydrae is a binary star 99 light-years from Earth, easily divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 5.3 and the secondary is a purple star of magnitude 7.4. N Hydrae (N Hya) {{is a pair of}} stars of magnitudes 5.8 and 5.9. Struve 1270 (Σ1270) consists of a pair of stars, magnitudes 6.4 and 7.4.|$|E
