25|$|The {{value of}} a {{resistor}} can be measured with an <b>ohmmeter,</b> which may be one function of a multimeter. Usually, probes {{on the ends of}} test leads connect to the resistor. A simple <b>ohmmeter</b> may apply a voltage from a battery across the unknown resistor (with an internal resistor of a known value in series) producing a current which drives a meter movement. The current, in accordance with Ohm's law, is inversely proportional to the sum of the internal resistance and the resistor being tested, resulting in an analog meter scale which is very non-linear, calibrated from infinity to 0 ohms. A digital multimeter, using active electronics, may instead pass a specified current through the test resistance. The voltage generated across the test resistance in that case is linearly proportional to its resistance, which is measured and displayed. In either case the low-resistance ranges of the meter pass much more current through the test leads than do high-resistance ranges, in order for the voltages present to be at reasonable levels (generally below 10 volts) but still measurable.|$|E
2500|$|An {{instrument}} for measuring resistance is called an <b>ohmmeter.</b> [...] Simple ohmmeters cannot measure low resistances accurately because {{the resistance of}} their measuring leads causes a voltage drop that interferes with the measurement, so more accurate devices use four-terminal sensing.|$|E
2500|$|A {{multimeter}} is {{a combination}} of a multirange DC voltmeter, multirange AC voltmeter, multirange ammeter, and multirange <b>ohmmeter.</b> An un-amplified analog multimeter combines a meter movement, range resistors and switches; [...] VTVMs are amplified analog meters and contain active circuitry.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>ohmmeters</b> include Kelvin bridges {{in order}} to obtain large {{measurement}} ranges. Instruments for measuring sub-ohm values are often referred to as low-resistance <b>ohmmeters,</b> milli-ohmmeters, micro-ohmmeters, etc.|$|R

50|$|Four-terminal sensing (4T sensing), 4-wire sensing, or 4-point probes {{method is}} an {{electrical}} impedance measuring technique that uses separate pairs of current-carrying and voltage-sensing electrodes {{to make more}} accurate measurements than the simpler and more usual two-terminal (2T) sensing. Four-terminal sensing is used in some <b>ohmmeters</b> and impedance analyzers, and in wiring for strain gauges and resistance thermometers. Four-point probes are also used to measure sheet resistance of thin films.|$|R

5000|$|A faulty {{short-circuited}} capacitor will incorrectly {{be identified}} by an ESR meter as having ideally low ESR, but an <b>ohmmeter</b> or multimeter can easily detect this case, which is much rarer in practice than high ESR. It is possible to connect the test probes to an ESR meter and <b>ohmmeter</b> in parallel to check for both shorts and ESR in one operation; some meters both measure ESR and detect short-circuits.|$|E

5000|$|He invented two alloys, {{constantan}} and manganin. Weston developed measurement {{instruments for}} electric current—the modern {{foundation for the}} voltmeter, ammeter and wattmeter. In 1888 he formed the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation which would become famous for its voltmeters, ammeters, wattmeters, <b>ohmmeters,</b> frequency meters, transformers, and transducers. Weston developed a method for producing a [...] "true" [...] permanent magnet. Weston conceived of and built a magnetic speedometer. Weston also developed the dashboard ammeter for Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Also in 1888, Weston {{became president of the}} American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) until 1889.|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{resistance}} meters can {{be thought}} of as similar to the <b>Ohmmeters</b> used to test electrical circuits. Archaeological features can be mapped when they are of higher or lower resistivity than their surroundings. A stone foundation might impede the flow of electricity, while the organic deposits within a midden might conduct electricity more easily than surrounding soils. Although generally used in archaeology for planview mapping, resistance methods also have a limited ability to discriminate depth and create vertical profiles (see Electrical resistivity tomography). Further applications include the measurement of the electrical resistivity of concrete to determinate the corrosion potential in concrete structures.|$|R
50|$|While {{there are}} {{specialised}} instruments to detect short-circuits between adjacent PCB tracks, an ESR meter is useful {{because it can}} measure low resistances while injecting a voltage too low to confuse readings by switching on semiconductor junctions in the circuit. An ESR meter {{can be used to}} find short-circuits, even finding which of a group of capacitors or transistors connected in parallel by printed circuit tracks or wires is short-circuited. Many conventional <b>ohmmeters</b> and multimeters are not usable for very low resistances, and those that are often use too high a voltage, risking damage to the circuit being tested.|$|R

5000|$|Subsequent {{designs of}} <b>ohmmeter</b> {{provided}} a small battery {{to apply a}} voltage to a resistance via a galvanometer to measure the current through the resistance (battery, galvanometer and resistance all connected in series). The scale of the galvanometer was marked in ohms, because the fixed voltage from the battery assured that as resistance is increased, the current through the meter (and hence deflection) would decrease. Ohmmeters form circuits by themselves, therefore they cannot be used within an assembled circuit. This design is much simpler and cheaper than the former design, and was simple to integrate into a multimeter design and consequently {{was by far the}} most common form of analogue <b>ohmmeter.</b> This type of <b>ohmmeter</b> suffers from two inherent disadvantages. First, the meter needs to be zeroed by shorting the measurement points together and performing an adjustment for zero ohms indication prior to each measurement. This is because as the battery voltage decreases with age, the series resistance in the meter needs to be reduced to maintain the zero indication at full deflection (assuming it's adjustable). Second, and consequent on the first, the actual deflection for any given resistor under test changes as the internal resistance is altered. It remains correct at the centre of the scale only, which is why such <b>ohmmeter</b> designs always quote the accuracy [...] "at centre scale only".|$|E
50|$|Measuring low-value resistors, such as fractional-ohm resistors, with {{acceptable}} accuracy requires four-terminal connections. One pair of terminals applies a known, calibrated {{current to}} the resistor, {{while the other}} pair senses the voltage drop across the resistor. Some laboratory quality <b>ohmmeters,</b> especially milliohmmeters, {{and even some of}} the better digital multimeters sense using four input terminals for this purpose, which may be used with special test leads. Each of the two so-called Kelvin clips has a pair of jaws insulated from each other. One side of each clip applies the measuring current, while the other connections are only to sense the voltage drop. The resistance is again calculated using Ohm's Law as the measured voltage divided by the applied current.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>ohmmeters</b> {{were based}} on a type of meter {{movement}} known as a 'ratiometer'. [...] These were similar to the galvanometer type movement encountered in later instruments, but instead of hairsprings to supply a restoring force they used conducting 'ligaments'. These provided no net rotational force to the movement. Also, the movement was wound with two coils. One was connected via a series resistor to the battery supply. The second was connected to the same battery supply via a second resistor and the resistor under test. The indication on the meter was proportional to the ratio of the currents through the two coils. This ratio was determined by the magnitude of the resistor under test. The advantages of this arrangement were twofold. First, the indication of the resistance was completely independent of the battery voltage (as long as it actually produced some voltage) and no zero adjustment was required. Second, although the resistance scale was non linear, the scale remained correct over the full deflection range. By interchanging the two coils a second range was provided. This scale was reversed compared to the first. A feature of this type of instrument was that it would continue to indicate a random resistance value once the test leads were disconnected (the action of which disconnected the battery from the movement). <b>Ohmmeters</b> of this type only ever measured resistance as they could not easily be incorporated into a multimeter design. Insulation testers that relied on a hand cranked generator operated on the same principle. This ensured that the indication was wholly independent of the voltage actually produced.|$|R

50|$|Electrical {{resistance}} meters can {{be thought}} of as similar to the <b>Ohmmeters</b> used to test electrical circuits. In most systems, metal probes are inserted into the ground to obtain a reading of the local electrical resistance. A variety of probe configurations are used, most having four probes, often mounted on a rigid frame. Capacitively coupled systems that do not require direct physical contact with the soil have also been developed. Archaeological features can be mapped when they are of higher or lower resistivity than their surroundings.

40|$|Very low {{frequency}} (VLF) military communications systems provide a primary field {{that can be}} used for shallow geophysical surveys to locate ground water contamination and vertical geologic contacts. Useful properties that can be easily obtained from the interaction of the earth and the primary field are the magnitude of the vertical secondary magnetic field, the surface impedence, and the phase angle between the electrical and magnetic horizontal components. The variations in the secondary magnetic field can be related to vertical geologic contacts, such as the edges of landfill trenches. The surface impedence yields an apparent terrain conductivity, which can be used to locate low-resistivity anomalies often associated with contaminated ground water. The phase angle gives information on vertical variations in resistivity, phase angles less than 45 ° indicating increasing resistivity with depth. The depth of penetration of the VLF field is about one skin depth. For a frequency of 20 kHz, the skin depth in meters is approximately equal to 3. 67 inline image where p is terrain resistivity in <b>ohmmeters...</b>|$|R
