40|$|Introduction: In {{the chronic}} rhinosinusitis (CRS) {{definition}} of the RhinoSinusitis Task Force (RSTF) of the American Academy <b>of</b> <b>Otolaryngology-Head</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neck</b> Surgery,fever {{is one of the}} minor symptoms. In the EP 3 OS definition fever is not Mentioned as a contributing factor. The main aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the role of fever in CRS. Patients and methods: Patients with CRS, scheduled for surgery were compared with a control group consisting of patients without CRS, suffering from esthetic complaints or obstruction of the nose. Temperature prior to surgery was measured and analyzed. Results: In both groups, hundred patients were included. In the CRS group the mean temperature was 36 94 degrees C, with a maximum of 37. 8 degrees C The control group revealed a mean temperature of 36. 87 degrees C Analysis demonstrated no significant difference between the mean temperatures of the CRS patients and the controls (p = 0. 306). Additional analysis, correcting for possible confounders, did not reveal significant differences between both groups either. Discussion: There have been several attempts to define CRS in the past, hill all all including definition or classification system for this disorder does not currently exist. Fever is a factor under discussion. We found no significant difference between the preoperative hod, temperature in CRS patients and controls. These results suggest that fever is not a relevant symptom in CR...|$|R

The surgical management of inverted papillomas of the maxillary sinus {{has evolved from}} large en block excisions requiring external incisions to the minimally invasive endoscopic and endoscopic-as-sisted techniques used today. The traditional endoscopic approach involves resection of the inferior turbinate to perform an endoscopic medial maxillectomy, which can cause atrophic rhinitis and shrinking of the maxillary sinus, resulting in difficulty following these patients for recurrence in the office. In this article, we present a series of patients who underwent a modified endoscopic surgical approach for the excision of maxillary sinus inverted papillomas. In our approach, we preserve the inferior turbinate to preserve nasal mucosa physiol-ogy. Patient characteristics, recurrence rates, and complications asso-ciated with this approach are reviewed. © 2010 American Academy <b>of</b> <b>Otolaryngology–Head</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neck</b> Sur-gery Foundation. All rights reserved. Inverted papillomas are histologically benign, but locallyaggressive, lesions with a high recurrence rate and a small risk of malignant conversion. They account for approximately 0. 5 to seven percent of all nasal tumors. Approximately 34 to 49 percent of lesions originate in the maxillary sinus. 1 - 5 Be-cause of their locally aggressive behavior, five to 15 percent risk of malignant conversion, and propensity for recurrence, surgical resection is the mainstay of therapy. 2, 4 Over the last 15 years, endoscopic and endoscopic-assisted techniques have been described for removal of inverted pap-illomas. Traditionally, this involves resection of the inferior turbinate to perform an endoscopic medial maxillectomy. We present a modification to the previously described endoscopic techniques in which the inferior turbinate is spared to preserve {{as much of the}} physiology of the nose as possible...|$|R

Previously, we reported that the blockage of store-operated Ca 2 + entry inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF) -stimulated migration and distant metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. However, the effects of pharmacological blocker on other Ca 2 + signaling-regulated malignant characteristics in NPC cells remained poorly understood. Methods: We {{examined the effects of}} SKF 96365, an inhibitor of store-operated Ca 2 + channel, on EGF-launched Ca 2 + signaling in two NPC cell lines. We determined the effects of SKF 96365 on cell proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis, and cell-cycle status in vitro. We further elucidated the antitumor activity of SKF 96365 in xenograft-bearing mice. Results: It was found that SKF 96365 disturbed the thapsigargin (TG) -stimulated Ca 2 + release from endoplasmic reticulum and the subsequent Ca 2 + influx. SKF 96365 alone stimulated Ca 2 + responses merely due to endoplasmic reticulum-released Ca 2 +. SKF 96365 promoted cell mortality, inhibited colony formation, and induced apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest, while blunting the EGF-evoked Ca 2 + signaling. Furthermore, we confirmed that SKF 96365 reduced NPC xenograft growth while activating caspase- 7 -related apoptotic pathway. Conclusion: SKF 96365 exerts multiple antitumor activities through the distraction on the oncogenic Ca 2 + signaling transduction in NPC cells.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} scar outcome of video-assisted parathyroidectomy (VAP) with {{traditional}} bilateral cervical exploration (BCE) using previously validated scar assessment scales, {{and to examine}} the feasibility of introducing VAP into a general <b>otolaryngology-head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> practice. DESIGN: A retrospective review of medical records from a prospectively obtained database of patients and long-term follow-up of scar analysis. PATIENTS: The records of 60 patients undergoing parathyroidectomy were reviewed: 29 patients underwent VAP and 31 patients underwent an open procedure with BCE. The groups were matched for age and sex. A total of 46 patients were followed up to assess scar outcome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was a comparison of patient and observer scar satisfaction between VAP and traditional BCE using validated scar assessment tools: the Patient Scar Assessment Scale and the Manchester Scar Scale. The secondary outcomes were to retrospectively evaluate our results with VAP and to assess the suitability of introducing this technique into a general <b>otolaryngology-head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> practice. RESULTS: The average scar length in the VAP group was 1. 7 cm, and the average scar length in the BCE group was 4. 3 cm. The patients in the BCE group scored higher than the patients in the VAP group on the Manchester Scar Scale (P <. 01) and on the Patient and Observer Scar Scales (P =. 02), indicating a worse scar outcome. The mean operative time in the VAP group was 41 minutes compared with 115 minutes in the open procedure BCE group. There {{was no difference between}} the 2 groups in terms of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Video-assisted parathyroidectomy is a safe and feasible procedure in the setting <b>of</b> a general <b>otolaryngology-head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> practice, with outcomes and complication rates that are comparable to those of traditional bilateral neck exploration.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{clinically}} {{evaluate a}} new photosensitizer, m-tetra(hydroxyphenyl) chlorin (m-THPC), for the photodynamic therapy of early squamous cell carcinomas {{of the upper}} aerodigestive tract. DESIGN: Phase 1 included evaluation of the innocuousness of the compound after intravenous injection (control of vital parameters and blood analysis before and after injection) and evaluation of the duration of skin photosensitization. Phase 2 included assessment of optimal conditions for treatment (injected dose, drug-light interval, light dose, wavelength, etc), on 33 early squamous cell carcinomas of the mouth, esophagus, and bronchi, with a mean follow-up of 14 months; irradiation tests on healthy and neoplastic mucosae to determine the irradiation conditions that lead to tumor eradication with minimal damage to the surrounding normal mucosa and muscle layers; and localization of the dye in various tissue compartments and cells at different time intervals after the injection of the photosensitizer, by using a fluorescence microscope to analyze 46 biopsy specimens taken during the treatment sessions and 8 resected specimens of early cancers, excised with the carbon dioxide laser. SETTING: Endoscopic medical center <b>of</b> an <b>otolaryngology-head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> surgery department. PATIENTS: Twenty-five patients treated previously for a head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> cancer with a synchronous or metachronous early second primary cancer. Patients with porphyria {{were excluded from the}} trial. RESULTS: The best results in the bronchi and mouth were obtained with an injected dose of 0. 15 mg of m-THPC per kilogram of body weight 4 days before irradiation. The fluence was 7 to 16 J/cm 2, and the fluence rate was between 100 and 150 mW/cm 2 using red light at 652 nm. In the esophagus, green light at 514 nm is preferred to the red light to avoid fistulas. Optimal irradiation conditions at this wavelength, which was also used in the trachea, were found at a fluence of 75 to 100 J/cm 2 and a fluence rate between 70 and 100 mW/cm 2. Of 33 lesions treated thus far by photodynamic therapy with m-THPC, 28 show no recurrence with a mean follow-up of 14 months. Photosensitivity to sunlight does not exceed 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: m-Tetra(hydroxyphenyl) chlorin is a second-generation photosensitizer that has several significant advantages as compared with the first-generation porphyrin mixtures hematoporphyrin derivative and porfimer sodium (Photofrin II). It is a pure compound that is 100 times more phototoxic at 652 nm and 10 times more photoxic at 514 nm, has better selectivity for early carcinomas, and a shorter duration of skin photosensitivity. The therapeutic results indicate a recurrence rate that is similar to that obtained with Photofrin II, ie, about 15...|$|R
