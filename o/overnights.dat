5|$|Germany is {{the seventh}} most visited {{country in the}} world, {{with a total of}} 407 million <b>overnights</b> during 2012. This number {{includes}} 68.83 million nights by foreign visitors. In 2012, over 30.4 million international tourists arrived in Germany. Berlin has become the third most visited city destination in Europe. Additionally, more than 30% of Germans spend their holiday in their own country, with the biggest share going to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Domestic and international travel and tourism combined directly contribute over EUR43.2 billion to German GDP.

5|$|The sixth set of episodes also stayed {{below the}} 4 million mark, {{but in an}} evening that saw ITV beat BBC One's {{audience}} share in the evening by 19.6% to 19%, including the earlier episode of Red of Black? gaining 3.8m viewers, while the later show was viewed by slightly more with 3.9m. However, in direct competition with the later show was BBC One's Would I Lie to You? which had slightly more viewers, with 4m tuning in. On the return of Red or Black? to Saturday night, the show climbed above 4 million {{for the first time}} in three days, to 4.63m for the first show and then up to 5.67m for the second. This enabled ITV to beat BBC One in the primetime ratings overall, by 23.3% to 21%, even though the first episode of series 8 of Strictly Come Dancing was broadcast on BBC. However Red or Black? individually placed behind both Strictly and Doctor Who, with the <b>overnights</b> for the BBC shows being 7.6 and 6.0 million, respectively. Overall through the week the main ITV channel had a higher share of the ratings during primetime than BBC One on five out of the seven occasions, a turnaround from the previous week where it only won on a single evening.|$|E

We provide a plausible interpretation for these findings, and show that our Intra-Day/Overnight model significantly outperforms the standard ARCH framework based on daily returns for Out-of-Sample predictions...|$|R

The average captain's earnings were about $90,000 vs $120,000 per year for a theoretical first year Captain at airlines like United Airlines (there is no first year pay at United) {{but in the case}} of Skybus this included a significant stock options and profit share package unique in the airline industry. Additionally unusual for Skybus flight crew was that there were very few if any overnight trips thus giving the crew far fewer hours away from home (known as TAFB or time away from base) and higher crew utilization rates for more efficient work schedules. Typical Skybus pilot workdays were 8–10 hours long (FAA maximum is 16 hours), which was lower than the industry average of 12–14 hours. Typical pilot work months were 14–15 days with no <b>overnights.</b> The average pilot in the US has a work month of 16–17 days, and the average airline pilot wage is approximately $135,000 averaged between first officer and captain pay.|$|E

40|$|<b>Overnight</b> futures {{trading is}} {{available}} in the US, France and Australia. This study investigates the efficiency of Australian <b>overnight</b> futures prices and shows how <b>overnight</b> trading offers new opportunities for short-term risk management. We find that the <b>overnight</b> futures traders are very much focussed on simultaneous US daytime trading with US returns and Australian <b>overnight</b> returns having a correlation of 83 %. The <b>overnight</b> prices seem to overreact to the US market since subsequent early morning futures prices move in the opposite direction from the <b>overnight</b> return. The <b>overnight</b> prices can be used to compute 24 -hour returns for the US and Australia over exactly the same time interval. These synchronous returns can then be used to compute correlation measures. Daily data leads to large samples, hence smaller standard errors, and more flexibility when modeling dynamic correlations. They are also a vital input for short-term risk management, including daily Value-at-Risk. ...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{examine the}} {{duration}} of <b>overnight</b> fast and the significance of having an <b>overnight</b> fast below or above 11 hrs with respect to nutritional status among elderly nursing home residents. Background: Elderly nursing home residents are in high risk of malnutrition. In Norway {{it is recommended that}} the <b>overnight</b> fast should not exceed 11 hrs for elderly nursing home residents. Methods: <b>Overnight</b> fast and nutritional status was examined for 342 long-term nursing home residents. Nutritional status was evaluated by the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool, body mass index (BMI), weight loss during the last 3 - 6 months, triceps skinfold thickness, upper arm muscle circumference, and hand-grip strength. Findings: For 98. 5 % of the participants the <b>overnight</b> fast was > 11 hrs. Median <b>overnight</b> fast was 15 hrs. Among the participants for whom the <b>overnight</b> fast exceeded 11 hrs, 35. 6 % were in middle or high risk of malnutrition, and 20 % were underweight with BMI < 20 kg/m 2. No differences in <b>overnight</b> fast were observed between the different categories of nutritional status in this group. Conclusion: For many participants the <b>overnight</b> fast exceeded recommended length.
