2500|$|Ponds and Lakes are {{artificial}} {{bodies of}} open water {{that are usually}} created by constructing a dam wall with a weir <b>outlet</b> <b>structure.</b> Similar to constructed wetlands, {{they can be used}} to treat runoff by providing extended detention and allowing sedimentation, absorption of nutrients and UV disinfection to occur. In addition, they provide an aesthetic quality for recreation, wildlife habitat, and valuable storage of water that can potentially be reused for e.g. irrigation. Often, artificial ponds and lakes also form part of a flood detention system. Aquatic vegetation plays an important role for the water quality in artificial lakes and ponds in respect of maintaining and regulating the oxygen and nutrient levels. [...] Due to a water depth greater than 1.5m, emergent macrophytes are usually restricted to the margins but submergent plants may occur in the open water zone. Fringing vegetation can be useful in reducing bank erosion. Ponds are normally not used as stand-alone WSUD measure but are often combined with sediment basins or constructed wetlands as pretreatments.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} simulation {{model has been}} developed to simulate the hydraulic and heat transfer properties of a stormwater detention pond. The model is dynamic (unsteady) and based on basic principles of hydraulics and heat transfer. It is driven by hourly climate and weather data. To calibrate and validate the pond model field data were collected on a commercial site (State Farm Insurance Company) in Woodbury, Minnesota. The relationship between pond inflow and outflow rates to precipitation was effectively calibrated using continuously recorded pond level. Algorithms developed for surface heat transfer in lakes {{were found to be}} applicable to the pond with some modification. A significant diurnal thermal stratification was simulated and measured in the pond which had 2. 4 m depth. Temperature differences from top to bottom were as high as 13 oC during daytime hours. The outflowing water temperature was essentially equal to the pond surface temperature because the outlet was located near the pond surface. Outflow water temperatures were calculated with a RMSE of 1. 4 oC. Water clarity had little effect on the pond outflow temperatures but the pond bottom temperature was found to be highly sensitive to water clarity. For pond designs with <b>outlet</b> <b>structures</b> that take subsurface water, water clarity will introduce uncertainty to simulations of the pond temperature profile and the pond outlet temperature. Further work is required to consider other pond designs with alternate <b>outlet</b> <b>structures,</b> significant shading, and wind sheltering. Surface shading should include consideration of terrestrial vegetation (trees), emergent, submerged, and floating leaf aquatic vegetation, Algae need {{to be included in the}} water clarity. Wet ponds with subsurface outlet withdrawal and high surface shading from emergent or floating leaf plants may yield significantly lower outlet temperatures than typical wet pond designs.

40|$|AbstractLarge {{cost savings}} have been {{achieved}} {{in the production of}} food fish with the use of larger systems and enhanced production management strategies. These trends have also included the use of large circular culture tanks because of their many advantages for food fish production. Circular tanks make good culture vessels because they can provide a uniform culture environment, can be operated under a wide range of rotational velocities to optimize fish health and condition, and can be used to rapidly concentrate and remove settleable solids. The flow inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>structures</b> and fish grading and/or removal mechanisms should be engineered to reduce the labor requirements of handling fish and to obtain effective tank rotational characteristics, mixing, and solids flushing. This paper reviews and discusses the rationale and criteria needed to design circular culture tanks. In addition, the implementation of continuous production and satiation feeding strategies within circular culture tanks is discussed because of their large and often under-emphasized effect on overall system productivity...|$|R

40|$|In 2015 Georgetown, Guyana {{suffered}} from major flooding due to heavy rainfall. The {{use of a}} centuries-old agricultural drainage system for the urban drainage of the largest urbanized area of Guyana, poses problems considering flood safety. In 2016 a report was published by a ‘Dutch Risk Reduction Team’ (DRR Team) with recommendations on how to reduce the current flood vulnerability. Based on the recommendations from this DRR report. A team of seven students from the Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands, went to Georgetown and analysed the drainage system in more detail. Several methods were developed in collaboration with local students and experts {{which can be used}} to analyse the system.

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents a}} review of the often contradictory literature describing the effects of release waters on the tailwater environment and biota. The physical and chemical conditions found in tailwaters downstream from warmwater and coldwater discharge impoundments are compared and contrasted to those found in natural streams. Reservoir discharges modify the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the stream ecosystem. Physical and chemical characteristics in tailwaters are primarily determined by the depth, volume,and schedule of water releases. The magnitude of change is related to the type of reservoir and to the design and operation of <b>outlet</b> <b>structures.</b> The structure of the biotic community reflects the physical and chemical conditions existing in a particular tailwater. The community is composed of organisms, including nonnative species, that are adapted to this environment.

5000|$|In the 1950s, the USGS studied Lake San Cristobal as a {{possible}} site for an artificial embankment dam. Such a dam would have been built near the present outlet and spanned the entire valley.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} and ranks restoration {{alternatives for}} improving fish habitat by evaluating tradeoffs between fish production and restoration costs. Optimization modelling {{is used to}} maximize out‐migrating coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) from a natal stream and is applied {{as a case study}} in California’s Shasta River. Restoration activities that alter flow and water temperature conditions are the decision variables in the model and include relocating a major diversion, increasing riparian shading, increasing instream flow, restoring a cool‐water spring and removing a dam. A budget constraint limits total restoration expenditures. This approach combines simple fish population modelling with flow and water quality modelling to explore management strategies and aid decision making. Previous fish habitat optimization research typically uses single restoration strategies, usually by altering reservoir releases or modifying <b>outlet</b> <b>structures.</b> Our method enlarges the solution space to more accurately represent extensive and integrated solutions to fish habitat problems. Results indicate that restoration alternatives can be prioritized by fish habitat improvement and restoration cost. For the Shasta River case study, considerable habitat restoration investments were required before fish productivity increased substantially. This exercise illustrates the potential of ecological optimization for highlighting promising restoration approaches and dismissing poor alternatives. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley &...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} a modeling {{study of}} heat loading and stream temperature in Miller Creek {{in support of}} the MPCA Miler Creek temperature TMDL. The MINUHET surface runoff modeling tool was used to characterize runoff temperatures for typical residential and commercial watersheds for the continuous period June 15 to September 15, 2008. These results were then generalized to the entire Miller Creek watershed using runoff volumes from a SWMM model developed at SAFL. These simulated runoff temperatures and volumes were then used to estimate point source heat loadings to Miller Creek for the same time period. Separate models for wet detention ponds, infiltration basins, and underground stormwater vaults were used to estimate possible reductions in heat loading from surface runoff. Standard wet ponds were found to increase overall heat inputs, but reduce peak heat loading rates and maximum stream temperature increases due to stormwater. The use of wet ponds with bottom <b>outlet</b> <b>structures</b> and underground vaults gave some reductions in effluent temperature for smaller rainfall events (< 1 cm), but were of little benefit for larger events. Infiltration practices give the greatest benefit in reducing temperature impacts of runoff, by direct reduction in runoff volume, however, widespread implementation of infiltration practices in the Miller Creek watershed may be difficult.
