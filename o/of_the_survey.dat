5|$|The king sent St-Calais on {{diplomatic}} {{missions to}} the French royal court and to Rome. After the king's imprisonment of Odo of Bayeux, Pope Gregory VII complained to him. The pope was {{also concerned about}} the king's refusal to allow the delivery of papal letters to the English bishops unless royal permission was secured. To placate the pope, the king dispatched St-Calais to Rome, possibly with Lanfranc, to explain to the pope the reasons for imprisoning Odo. St-Calais also served as a commissioner in the south-western part of England for the Domesday Book, which aimed to survey the whole of England and record who owned the lands. Some historians, including David Bates, have argued that St-Calais was {{the driving force behind the}} organization of the entire Domesday survey, although other candidates have been put forward, including Samson, Bishop of Worcester, before he became bishop. Pierre Chaplais, who argues for St-Calais being the main organizer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey,</b> argues the bishop's exile in 1088 interrupted work on the Little Domesday Book, a subproject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> which was left uncompleted.|$|E

30|$|Specifically, none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{algorithms}} in the “Methods {{which require}} no target labels” section compare <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> their algorithm {{to others in}} the same category. Currently, the issue is that one cannot directly compare <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surveyed</b> algorithms using <b>the</b> data provided. This is because there are little commonalities observed in <b>the</b> experimental testbeds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surveyed</b> methods in each category. Comparing these methods using the little overlap that may exist would not provide meaningful conclusions due to <b>the</b> varied nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studies. Thus, these are shortcomings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current research. This is also <b>the</b> limitation <b>of</b> current research in this domain as we cannot provide a direct performance comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surveyed</b> methods. It would be insightful to have a comparative study conducted to evaluate <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surveyed</b> algorithms on a common, fair experimental testbed. To do this, a standardized test framework could be developed for heterogeneous transfer learning algorithms, as was done for homogeneous transfer learning algorithms [111, 112].|$|R

The battle ends with Zeke retreating, and the Colossal Titan defeated and killed by Armin, who became a Titan Shifter like Eren, but at the cost of the lives of almost {{all the members of the}} expedition, including the commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Survey</b> Corps, Erwin Smith.|$|E

Promoted lieutenant in the Citizens Military Force in July 1915, he transferred to the Australian Imperial Force on 1 February 1916 with the substantive rank of second lieutenant, and was placed in command of C Company of the 34th Battalion. In May, the battalion embarked from Sydney for the United Kingdom, with Jeffries aboard HMAT Hororata. Arriving in late June, the battalion spent the next five months training in England, during which time Jeffries was promoted to lieutenant.|$|E

5|$|In 1598 Alfonso Criado de Castilla became {{governor}} of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Owing to the poor state of Puerto de Caballos on the Honduran coast and its exposure to repeated pirate raids he sent a pilot to scout Lake Izabal. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey,</b> and after royal permission was granted, Criado de Castilla ordered {{the construction of a}} new port, named Santo Tomás de Castilla, at a favourable spot on the Amatique Bay not far from the lake. Work then began on building a highway from the port to the new capital of the colony, modern Antigua Guatemala, following the Motagua Valley into the highlands. Indigenous guides scouting the route from the highlands would not proceed further downriver than three leagues below Quiriguá, because the area was inhabited by the hostile Toquegua.|$|E

The castle passed into the care of central government in 1973, and is now controlled by English Heritage, who operate the site as a tourist attraction. An archaeological survey was commissioned by English Heritage in 1984, carried out by Rachel Newman of Lancaster University; the findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> led to a program of restoration work, completed in 1991. It is protected by law as a grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|Risley's survey {{task was}} aided when {{research}} papers of a recently deceased Indian Medical Service doctor, James Wise, {{were given to}} him by the doctor's widow. Wise had researched the people of Eastern Bengal and it was agreed that, after ascertaining the accuracy of his work, his research should be incorporated into Risley's survey results. In return, those volumes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> dealing with ethnographic matters would be dedicated to Wise. Further assistance came from the research of Edward Tuite Dalton into the jungle tribes of Chhotanagpur and Assam. Dalton, like Wise, had previously published his efforts but now they would be integrated {{as a part of a}} larger whole. Risley was able to deal with the remaining areas of Bengal by making use of a large staff of correspondents who came from disparate backgrounds, such as missionaries, native people and Government officials.|$|E

5|$|Sociological {{reasoning}} pre-dates {{the foundation}} of the discipline. Social analysis has origins in the common stock of Western knowledge and philosophy, and has been carried out from {{as far back as the}} time of ancient Greek philosopher Plato, if not before. The origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey,</b> i.e., the collection of information from a sample of individuals, can be traced back to at least the Domesday Book in 1086, while ancient philosophers such as Confucius wrote on the importance of social roles. There is evidence of early sociology in medieval Arab writings. Some sources consider Ibn Khaldun, a 14th-century Arab Islamic scholar from North Africa (Tunisia), to have been the first sociologist and father of sociology (see Branches of the early Islamic philosophy); his Muqaddimah was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on social cohesion and social conflict.|$|E
5|$|The bristle-faced free-tailed bat {{appears to}} be {{extremely}} rare across its range. It has been detected at {{a limited number of}} localities and at these sites it {{appears to be}} uncommon, often comprising less than 2% of the bats captured during surveys. In NSW it has only been recorded at a small number of locations despite recent extensive surveys at over 300 sites in suitable habitat. Its preferred mode of foraging by flying at low levels along stream corridors suggests that the low numbers captured in surveys using mist nets and harp traps are an indication of rarity and are not an artifact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> methodology. Long-term monitoring of known populations is required to determine changes in population status of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the Outer Solar System Survey (OSSOS) {{suggests}} that the observed clustering {{is the result of}} a combination of observing bias and small number statistics. OSSOS, a well-characterized survey of the outer Solar System with known biases, observed eight trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU with orbits oriented on a wide range of directions. After accounting for the known observational biases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey,</b> no evidence for the arguments of perihelion (ω) clustering identified by Trujillo and Sheppard was seen and the orientation of the orbits of the objects with the largest semi-major axis was statistically consistent with random. A previously released paper by Mike Brown analyzed the discovery locations of eccentric trans-Neptunian objects. While identifying some biases he found that even with these biases the clustering of longitudes of perihelion of the known objects would be observed only 1.2% of the time if their actual distribution was uniform.|$|E
