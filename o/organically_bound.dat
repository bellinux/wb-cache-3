40|$|International audienceThe Roussillon {{sedimentary}} Basin (South France) is {{a complex}} multi-layered aquifer, close to the Mediterranean Sea facing seasonally increases of water abstraction and salinization issues. We report geochemical and isotopic vertical variability in this aquifer using groundwater sampled with a Westbay System® at two coastal monitoring sites: Barcarès and Canet. The Westbay sampling allows pointing out and explaining the variation of water quality along vertical profiles, both in productive layers and in the less permeable ones {{where most of the}} chemical processes are susceptible to take place. The aquifer layers are not equally impacted by salinization, with electrical conductivity ranging from 460 to 43, 000 μS·cm− 1. The δ 2 H–δ 18 O signatures show mixing between seawater and freshwater components with long water residence time as evidenced by the lack of contribution from modern water using 3 H, 14 C and CFCs/SF 6. S(SO 4) isotopes also evidence seawater contribution but some signatures can be related to oxidation of pyrite and/or <b>organically</b> <b>bounded</b> S. In the upper layers 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios are close to that of seawater and then increase with depth, reflecting water–rock interaction with argillaceous formations while punctual low values reflect interaction with carbonate. Boron isotopes highlight secondary processes such as adsorption/desorption onto clays in addition to mixings. At the Barcarès site (120 m deep), the high salinity in some layers appear to be related neither to present day seawater intrusion, nor to Salses-Leucate lagoonwater intrusion. Groundwater chemical composition thus highlights binary mixing between fresh groundwater and inherited salty water together with cation exchange processes, water–rock interactions and, locally, sedimentary organic matter mineralisation probably enhanced by pyrite oxidation.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the role of S- and P-mobilizing bacteria in plant growth promotion in biochar-amended soil, which has been rarely investigated so far. Pot experiments of Lolium perenne were established on S and P limited soil with 1 % or 2 % biochar (Miscanthusxgiganteus) or without biochar (control) for a period of 126 days. Both biochar amendments resulted in significant plant growth promotion. Rhizobacteria capable of growing with (1) S from aromatic sulfonates, (2) P from phosphate esters, (3) P from phosphonates, and (4) P from tri-calcium phosphates as sole source of S or P, respectively, were significantly more abundant in the biochar treatments. 16 S rRNA gene-based rhizobacteria community analysis revealed a significant biochar treatment effect. Abundance of nematodes feeding on bacteria was also significantly increased in the biochar treatments. Diversity analysis of rhizospheric asfA and phnJ genes revealed broad sequence diversities in bacterial sulfonate and phosphonate-mineralizing capabilities.

We investigated micro-scale P distribution and binding forms in siliceous soil aggregates by combining advanced spectrometric and spectroscopic techniques to introduce new insights on P accessibility and availability in soils.

40|$|Inadequate diet {{can result}} in a series of {{undesired}} occurrences in cattle production, marked as nutritive diseases. In a certain number of cases there is a clearly defined deficiency of certain nutritive matter, with a typical clinical picture and recognizable symptoms. In a far greater number of cases, chronic conditions occur as a result of so-called graphic deficits, when the deficiency of certain components is so small that signs of deficiency develop over a longer time period. Such cases are at first accompanied by non-specific symptomatology, detection and prevention are much more difficult, while resulting damages in cattle production are substantial. The work gives a brief survey of the most important microelements added to cattle diet - iron, copper, manganese, zinc, iodine selenium, cobalt, and chromium. In addition to elementary data in connection with the contents of certain microelements in the organism of the animal the physiological role, natural sources, manner and place of resorption in the organism, and mechanisms of elimination, special attention is paid to symptoms of deficiency and sufficiency, and daily requirements in the ruminant diet. The conclusions direct the reader to several possible sources of mineral matter, with special emphasis on <b>organically</b> - <b>bound</b> microelements in the form of chelates - complexes swith one or more stable heterocyclic amino acid rings. Commercial mineral additives are described as proteinates, and bioplexes are mixes of amino acids and peptides. Chelate forms have been demonstrated aas very successful in stress situations and in diseased animals, when the organism exhibits increased needs, and the ability of feed utilization is reduced. Contrary to non-organic forms, which only temporarely increase concentration in blood, chelate forms secure considerably longer maintenance of the necessary concentration. Having in mind also the increased need of damaged tissue for certain amino acids their correct selection as a chelate agent can additionally stimulate the resorption of mineral matter. Moreover, the fact that retention and the biological half-life of mineral matter taken in through chelates are considerably longer than with conventional supplementation, {{it is clear that the}} end consumers have at their disposal a powerful and reliable method of securing the necessary microelements. By following theoretical knowledge about the necessary quantities in certain stages of breeding and production the problems of microelement deficiency, and thus consequently the resulting negative effects, can be prevented and avoided by choosing chelate forms...|$|R

Animal food products represent {{a potentially}} important source of tritium in the human diet {{and a number of}} transfer coefficient values for tritium transfer to a limited number of animal products are available. In this paper we present an approach for the derivation of tritium transfer coefficients which is based on the metabolism of hydrogen in animals. The derived transfer coefficients separately account for transfer to and from free (i. e. water) and <b>organically</b> <b>bound</b> tritium. A novel aspect of the approach is that tritium transfer can be predicted for any animal product for which the required metabolic input parameters are available. The predicted transfer coefficients are compared to available independent data. Agreement is good (R 2 = 0. 97) {{with the exception of the}} transfer coefficient for transfer from tritiated water to <b>organically</b> <b>bound</b> tritium in ruminants.

It is possible to derive concentration ratio values from the estimated transfer coefficients which relate the concentration of tritiated water and <b>organically</b> <b>bound</b> tritium in an animal product to their respective concentrations in the animals diet.

Dissolved interstitial phosphate from fish debris is revealed by an excess amount of phosphate over that predicted from a simple stoichiometric oxidative regeneration model and by anomalously high dissolved interstitial fluoride concentrations. Phosphate flux estimates based on diffusion from the sediment suggest that this mechanism may generate up to 10...|$|E
40|$|The {{ash yield}} and {{concentrations}} of twenty-four minor and trace elements, including twelve potentially hazardous trace elements were determined in Mukah coal from Sarawak, Malaysia. Comparisons {{made to the}} Clarke values show that Mukah coal is depleted in Ag, Ba, Be, Cd, Co. Mn, Ni, Se, U, and V. On the other hand, it is enriched in As, Cr, Cu, Pb, Sb, Th, and Zn. Among the trace elements studied, V and Ba are associated predominantly with the clay minerals. Manganese, Cr, Cu, Th, and Ni are mostly bound within the aluminosilicate, sulphide and/or carbonate minerals in varying proportions, though a portion of these elements are also <b>organically</b> <b>bound.</b> Arsenic, Pb and Sb are mostly <b>organically</b> <b>bound,</b> though some of these elements are also associated with the sulphide minerals. Zinc is associated with both the organic and inorganic contents of the coal. Among the potentially hazardous trace elements, Be, Cd, Co, Mn, Ni, Se, and U may be of little or no health and environmental concerns, whereas As, Cr, Pb, Sb and Th require further examination for their potential health and environmental concerns. Of particular concern are the elements As, Pb and Sb, which are mostly <b>organically</b> <b>bound</b> and hence cannot be removed by physical cleaning technologies. They escape during coal combustion, either released as vapours to the atmosphere or are adsorbed onto the fine fly ash particles. (C) 2011 Elsevier ay. All rights reserved...|$|E
