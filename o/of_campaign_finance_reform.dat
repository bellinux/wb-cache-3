5|$|At {{the end of}} {{his term}} as governor, Jones retired to Airdrie Stud. He started Commonwealth Broadcasting and joined with {{partners}} to purchase several radio and television stations in Kentucky and Tennessee. He remained a public advocate <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> and health care reform and was a supporter of posting the Ten Commandments in public schools.|$|E
5|$|At the {{expiration}} {{of his term}} as lieutenant governor in 1995, Patton announced his candidacy for governor. The 1995 gubernatorial election was novel in several ways, following a 1992 constitutional amendment. It was the first election in Kentucky history in which the governor and lieutenant governor were elected as a ticket. Another new provision stated that if no candidate received at least 40percent {{of the vote in}} his or her party's primary, a runoff election would occur between the top two candidates. Most significantly, {{for the first time in}} Kentucky history the winners of each race would be allowed to succeed themselves in office and serve another term. Also, as a result <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> passed under Governor Jones, candidates would receive public campaign financing and would have their campaign spending capped, negating the advantage of wealthy candidates.|$|E

25|$|Boniface II {{attempted}} to re-entrench {{the practice of}} appointing his successor, but the public outcry was too great, resulting in a highly disputed election in 532 characterized by widespread accounts of bribery and coercion, which resulted in Pope John II (the first to take a papal name). Athalaric, the Ostrogoth king, forced John II to approve decrees that banned any private agreements to elect a pope and enacting limits {{on the amount of}} money that could be spent during a papal election (an early example <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform).</b> In fact, Athalaric himself was able to engineer the election of Pope Silverius, the son of Pope Hormisdas, upon John II's death.|$|E
500|$|McCain and Bush {{argued over}} their {{proposals}} for tax cuts; McCain criticized Bush's plan as too large and too {{beneficial to the}} wealthy. [...] McCain preferred a smaller cut that would allocate more of the surplus towards the solvency of Social Security and Medicare. [...] McCain pushed his signature issue <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform,</b> and was the only candidate to talk much about foreign policy and defense issues.|$|E

2500|$|Campaign finance expert Jan Baran, {{a member}} of the Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform, agreed with the decision, writing that [...] "The history <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> is the history of {{incumbent}} politicians seeking to muzzle speakers, any speakers, particularly those who might publicly criticize them and their legislation. It is a lot easier to legislate against unions, gun owners, 'fat cat' bankers, health insurance companies and any other industry or 'special interest' group when they can't talk back." [...] Baran further noted that in general conservatives and libertarians praised the ruling's preservation of the First Amendment and freedom of speech, but that liberals and campaign finance reformers criticized it as greatly expanding the role of corporate money in politics.|$|E

40|$|Scholars have {{proposed}} many routes by which <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> laws may impact turnout. For instance, laws restricting campaign spending may decrease mobilization, resulting in lower turnout. Alternatively, such laws might increase {{the competitiveness of}} elections, resulting in higher turnout. Existing studies {{tend to focus on}} only one causal pathway, ignoring the net effects <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reforms</b> on voter turnout. We exploit the variation in state <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> laws from 1950 to 2000 in order to estimate the reduced-form relationships between reform and turnout. Using both aggregate and individual-level data, we find that <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> laws on net have little impact on turnout in gubernatorial elections. There are two exceptions to this finding: Limits on organizational contributions are shown in an individual level analysis to increase turnout prior to a sea change in <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> ushered in by the Buckley v. Valeo decision in 1976, while public financing laws are shown to have an equally large negative impact on turnout in the post-Buckley era. These results strengthens the existing literature, which finds similarly perverse effects of public financing on the “quality of democracy,” and demonstrates the advantages of reduced-form analysis for understanding the influence of laws on behavior...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a long-standing}} {{scholarly}} {{literature on the}} electoral effects <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> spending; nevertheless, the academic research offers only limited guidance for policy makers interested in <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform.</b> In part, this is because existing studies have focused narrowly on some vexing statistical issues, while ignoring many others. But it is also because political scientists have not devoted enough effort conducting evaluation studies of how regulatory policies impact the intermediate goal of competition, let alone the ultimate policy goals of reduced corruption, increased citizen participation and improved public policy. Consequently, {{there is a great}} need for updated and improved analyses of the treatment effect <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> spending on political competition in a variety of electoral contexts, but an even greater need for the application of modern evaluation methods to the more basic question <b>of</b> whether <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reforms</b> “work ” as advertised...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{argues that}} the U. S. Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion in McConnell v. FEC {{illustrates}} three important lessons about judicial review in the distinct context <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> finance: (1) precedent counts; (2) pragmatism beats platitudes; and (3) legislative judgments deserve respect. According to early critics of McConnell, the Court abdicated its responsibilities in upholding the major provisions <b>of</b> the Bipartisan <b>Campaign</b> Reform Act. Critics claimed that the Court did not sufficiently explain its decisions, abandoned free speech principles, and ignored the self-entrenching motives of incumbents who passed the law. This Essay responds to these claims and asserts {{that they must be}} balanced against the gains that stem from tight language that emphasizes precedent, pragmatic consideration of competing interests and context, and congressional expertise in the political landscape <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance.</b> In light <b>of</b> the limited competence and authority of judges to address political questions unique to <b>campaign</b> <b>finance,</b> adherence to precedent in deciding <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> cases enhances judicial credibility and provides legislatures a more stable framework for lawmaking. At the same time, however, <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> features evolving political practices, coalitions, organizations, and technologies that courts often cannot anticipate. When Congress identifies emerging practices that threaten democracy, a court should apply past cases pragmatically to the facts before it and avoid sweeping dogma that may grow dated and contribute to bad results in future cases. <b>Campaign</b> <b>finance</b> is a complex area that involves competing considerations rather than absolutes. As a result, textured and multifaceted judicial review <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reforms</b> is preferable to review that is either one-dimensionally deferential or one-dimensionally skeptical...|$|R
