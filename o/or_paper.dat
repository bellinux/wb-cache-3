5|$|X. bracteatum and its {{relatives}} {{belong to}} the Gnaphalieae <b>or</b> <b>paper</b> daisies, a large tribe within the daisy family, Asteraceae. However, a 2002 molecular study of the Gnaphalieae has indicated the genus Xerochrysum is probably polyphyletic, as the two species sampled, X.bracteatum and X.viscosum, were not closely related to each other. X. bracteatum has been recorded hybridising with X.viscosum and X.papillosum in cultivation, and possibly also Coronidium elatum and C.boormanii.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{voted to}} address the {{platform}} before deciding on nominees, and debate began when they reconvened at 8:45p.m. Many fights and compromises had been hashed out in the Resolutions Committee already, but the delegates insisted on debating several provisions. On many planks, there was widespread agreement among the delegates. On the monetary issue, the platform declared that all money, whether metal <b>or</b> <b>paper,</b> should be issued by the government, not by banks (as was common for paper money at the time). They also called for the unlimited coinage of silver and the repayment of the national debt in bonds, rather than gold dollars. Other planks of the platform called for a graduated income tax, laws to mandate safe working conditions in factories, the regulation of interstate commerce, {{and an end to}} child and convict labor; all of these were familiar parts of Greenback platforms from earlier elections, and provoked no serious dissent.|$|E
5|$|The fan crest {{was later}} {{developed}} by cutting out the figure displayed on it, {{to form a}} metal outline; this evolved in the late 13th and early 14th centuries into a three-dimensional sculpture. These were usually made of cloth, leather <b>or</b> <b>paper</b> over a wooden or wire framework, and were typically {{in the form of}} an animal; also popular were wings, horns, human figures, and panaches of feathers. These were probably worn only in tournaments, not battle: not only did they add to the already considerable weight of the helm, they could also have been used by opponents as a handle to pull the wearer's head down.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{service was}} operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty-two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage, which had longitudinal bench seating and sliding {{doors at the}} ends, leading onto a platform for boarding and alighting. It was reasoned {{that there was nothing}} to look at in the tunnels, so the only windows were in a narrow band high up in the carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Because of their claustrophobic interiors, the carriages soon became known as padded cells. Unlike other railways, the C had no ticket classes <b>or</b> <b>paper</b> tickets; when the railway began operations, a flat fare of two pence, collected at a turnstile, was charged. Despite the cramped carriages and competition from bus and tram services, the railway attracted 5.1million passengers in 1891, its first year of operation. To alleviate overcrowding, the fleet of rolling stock was enlarged.|$|E
5|$|All figures quoted for {{the losses}} of the cavalry brigades {{as a result}} of this charge are estimates, as {{casualties}} were only noted down after the day of the battle and were for the battle as a whole. Some historians, Barbero for example, believe the official rolls tend to overestimate the number of cavalrymen present in their squadrons on the field of battle and that the proportionate losses were, as a result, considerably higher than the numbers on paper might suggest. The Union Brigade lost heavily in both officers and men killed (including its commander, William Ponsonby, and Colonel Hamilton of the Scots Greys) and wounded. The 2nd Life Guards and the King's Dragoon Guards of the Household Brigade also lost heavily (with Colonel Fuller, commander of the King's DG, killed). However, the 1st Life Guards, on the extreme right of the charge, and the Blues, who formed a reserve, had kept their cohesion and consequently suffered significantly fewer casualties. On the rolls the official, <b>or</b> <b>paper</b> strength, for both Brigades is given as 2,651 while Barbero and others estimate the actual strength at around 2,000 and the official recorded losses for the two heavy cavalry brigades during the battle was 1,205 troopers and 1,303 horses.|$|E
5|$|In Bengal, on {{the night}} of the sixth day after childbirth, a number of items may be placed in the lying-in chamber in {{deference}} to Shashthi, such as an earthen pitcher of water covered with a napkin, offerings of husked rice, cooked rice, bananas and sweets, bangles, and pieces of gold and silver. A pen and paper are also kept in the room, because it is believed that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on the paper with invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). A lump of cow dung dressed in red cloth <b>or</b> <b>paper</b> and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in room. Here, the new-born baby is oiled and dressed in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony. Childless people may perform a vrata (ritual) in worship of Shashthi, called either Chati Mata or Shashthi Vrata, in an effort to conceive.|$|E

25|$|Porous {{absorbers}} {{are most}} commonly made from fiberglass, mineral wool or {{open cell foam}} that resists the passage of air molecules through the interstitial space.

Facing also improves low bass absorption by translating the physical compression of air at the facing into physical compression of the fibers that are {{in contact with the}} facing while also maintaining the resistive loss of air as it is driven through the bulk of the fiber by the facing.|$|E
