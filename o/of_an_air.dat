5|$|If after 2–4days {{there is}} still {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> leak, various options are available. Negative pressure suction (at low pressures of –10 to –20cmH2O) at a high flow rate may be attempted, particularly in PSP; {{it is thought that}} this may accelerate the healing of the leak. Failing this, surgery may be required, especially in SSP.|$|E

To hide construction of the facility from the public, the East Wing was built on top of the bunker. This facility would later become the Presidential Emergency Operations Center.|$|E

5|$|A {{scheme was}} devised during the Second World War to protect major cities from enemy bombing by {{lighting}} decoy fires on nearby open land. Manchester {{was protected by}} four of these Starfish sites as they were known, two of them on Chat Moss. RAF Balloon Command {{was responsible for the}} administration and manning of the sites, which were fully operational by 23January 1941. Each consisted <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> raid shelter for the crew along with various devices to simulate street lighting and the explosions of incendiary bombs. The effectiveness of the decoy sites is uncertain, and they were closed in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Between 1991 and 1995, the 102d {{deployed}} to Panama {{as part of}} Operation Coronet Nighthawk, which was a drug interdiction operation. In 1992 the wing became simply the 102d Fighter Wing as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Air</b> Force-wide renaming of units. The wing was deployed from 1995 to 1998 to Iceland for periodic 45-day deployments. In 1998, the wing's members also trained and {{deployed to}} Iceland, Canada, Korea, and Europe. The next year, the 102d participated in Operation Northern Watch and was deployed to Turkey in order to enforce the no-fly zone over Iraq north of the 36th Parallel. In 2000, personnel were deployed to the Middle East and Europe in order to participate in Operation Southern Watch.|$|E
5|$|German {{ground forces}} {{crossed the border}} at 05:15 on 6 April, and the Reich Minister of Propaganda, Reichsleiter Joseph Goebbels, {{announced}} the declaration of war at 06:00.

The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air. At first, no aircraft could be seen approaching Belgrade.|$|E

5|$|Posted to Britain in April 1944, Barr went ashore at Omaha Beach {{two days}} after D-Day as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> support control unit. During the {{campaign}} in Normandy, he flew rocket-armed Hawker Typhoons on operations against V-1 flying bomb launch sites. After his return to Australia on 11September, Barr was promoted to acting wing commander and appointed chief instructor at No.2 Operational Training Unit in Mildura, Victoria, taking over from Bobby Gibbes. He also went to New Guinea and flew some ground-attack missions in the Kittyhawk to gain experience in the South West Pacific theatre. Following the end of hostilities in August 1945, Barr was treated for recurring fever and underwent two operations on his limbs in No.6 RAAF Hospital, Heidelberg. He was discharged from the Air Force on 8October.|$|E
5|$|The Command {{was kept}} {{busy in the}} late 1940s. Units {{were sent to the}} Middle East and Palestine as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> {{policing}} policy, in co-operation with the Israeli Air Force and Egyptian Air Force to prevent conflict between the two countries owing to the formation of the state of Israel in 1948. While there, they undertook a major operation, Operation Bobcat, to prevent illegal Jewish migrants coming into Palestine. In May 1948 the variety of aircraft was reduced despite increasing demand for operations. In May, Palestinians began attacking British military installations throughout the region. In the largest British post-war action, Operation Dawn (13 to 14 May 1948) was launched with the support of Coastal Command.|$|E

5|$|The {{mission of}} the Swiss Air Force {{historically}} has been to support ground troops (erdkampf) in repelling invasions of neutral Swiss territory, with a secondary mission of defending the sovereignty of Swiss airspace. During World War II this doctrine was severely tested when Switzerland was literally {{caught in the middle}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> war and subjected to both attacks and intrusions by aircraft of all combatants. Its inability to prevent such violations of its neutrality led for a period to a complete cessation of air intercepts, followed by a practice of coercing small numbers of intruders to submit to internment.|$|E
5|$|This brought Kenney into {{conflict}} with the Chief of the Air Staff of the RAAF, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, who felt that an opportunity had been lost to simplify {{the administration of the}} RAAF. Kenney preferred to have Bostock in command, and while he regarded the antipathy between Jones and Bostock as a nuisance, was happy to leave arrangements the way they were. However, Kenney deviated from the normal structure <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> force by creating the Advanced Echelon (ADVON) under Whitehead. The new headquarters had the authority to change the assignments of aircraft in the forward area, where fast-changing weather and enemy action could overtake orders drawn up in Australia. Kenney was promoted to lieutenant general on 21 October 1942.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Cold War era, {{radar and}} antenna related {{applications}} remained a prominent research activity in EES' {{contracts with the}} Defense Department. Millimeter wave radar research, in particular, was prominent in EES' defense activities from the late 1950s, when the first military-designation millimeter wave radar was built at Georgia Tech, to the 1980s, when GTRI developed {{what was then the}} world's highest frequency microwave radar. EES' high-frequency radar research found applications in radio astronomy, meteorology and climate studies, which improved weather forecasting and climate models and assisted in NASA's planning of the Cassini and Galileo missions. Expansion of EES' antenna research in the 1970s, in particular, the development <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> defense antenna for the U.S. Army Missile Command, resulted in the establishment of the Huntsville Research Laboratory, GTRI's oldest off-campus research center.|$|E

5|$|XXI Bomber Command {{arrived on}} Saipan on October 12, 1944, {{and from the}} start Hansell was beset {{by a host of}} serious command problems, the worst of which were {{continued}} teething problems with the B-29, tardy delivery of aircraft, aircrews untrained in high altitude formation flying, primitive airfield conditions, lack <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> service command for logistical support, no repair depots, a total absence of target intelligence, stubborn internal resistance to daylight operations by his sole combat wing, subordinates in the XXI Bomber Command who lobbied for his removal, and Hansell’s inferiority in rank in dealing with other AAF commanders in the theater. Furthermore, Hansell was soon prohibited from flying combat missions with his command, possibly because of limited knowledge of the atomic bomb or the perception that he knew the existence of Ultra.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the early nuclear arms control work, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which {{suggested}} that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Air</b> Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.|$|E
5|$|Between 1993 and 1994, Vikram {{appeared}} {{in a series of}} films where he portrayed supporting roles.

Furthermore, Joshi cast him again alongside Mammooty in the action drama Sainyam in the role <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> cadet. During the period, Vikram also appeared in the small budget Telugu film Chirunavvula Varamistava in the lead role and as Akkineni Nageswara Rao's eldest son in the family drama Bangaru Kutumbam with both films failing commercially. A brief return to Tamil films also proved unsuccessful, with his role in Vikraman's multistarrer Pudhiya Mannargal with music composed by A. R. Rahman turning out to be a commercial failure.|$|E

5|$|Forrest Mims was {{interested}} in science and electronics as a youth and even built an analog computer while in high school. Mims graduated from Texas A University in 1966 (major in government with minors in English and history) then became a commissioned officer in the U.S. Air Force. While serving in Vietnam as an intelligence officer, Mims continued his model rocket hobby. At Texas A, Mims developed an infrared obstacle-sensing device and he experimented with it at the Saigon School for Blind Boys and Girls. Launching model rockets in an area accustomed to rocket attacks and working with blind children resulted in {{a story in the}} military newspaper, Stars and Stripes. This caught the attention <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>Air</b> Force Colonel, who arranged for Mims to be assigned to the Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland AFB even though Mims lacked an engineering degree.|$|E
5|$|The French {{would use}} the lessons learned at Muong Khoua {{and those of the}} 1952 Battle of Na San in their defence plans at Điện Biên Phủ, while the Viet Minh in turn would employ similar tactics of encirclement and {{strangulation}} there. The importance <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> bridge to maintain supply lines, strong artillery support to stave off human-wave Viet Minh attacks, and the need for isolated emplacements to mutually support each other, were also important tactics taken on board by the French from both conflicts. The disappearance of local civiliain populations previously friendly towards the French, which served as a precursor to Viet Minh attack, was also remembered by the Điện Biên Phủ troops. For the Viet Minh, their abilities to isolated and smother individual strongpoints while maintaining hidden artillery and support weapon emplacements {{out of the reach of}} French airstrikes and artillery were honed at both battles, as were their practicies of using human-wave attacks.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opens with}} Mangte Chungeijang Kom (Priyanka Chopra) in labour, walking towards the {{hospital}} with her husband, Onler Kom (Darshan Kumaar). Due to a curfew, they have difficulty finding a public transport and Onler is mistaken for an insurgent and beaten {{when he tries to}} find a vehicle. The film then shifts to a flashback in which Kom found boxing gloves in the remains <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>air</b> crash in 1991, which prompted her interest in boxing despite her father's disapproval. During an early fight, she chases a boy and ends up in a boxing gym. After realising that the coach of the gym, Narjit Singh (Sunil Thapa), was also the coach of the Asian champion Dingko Singh, Kom tells him about her boxing aspirations. He asks her to visit the gym for the next thirty days and says that he will only teach her if she is deserving enough. She starts visiting the gym, informing her mother but not her father. Days pass but her coach does not enquire about her. Due to Kom's dedication and stubbornness, Singh starts training her. Later, he suggests changing her name to Mary Kom.|$|E
