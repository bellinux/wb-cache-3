As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.|$|E

5|$|In February 1959, Hawker had {{completed}} practically {{all of the}} design work and thus passed the entirety of its manufacturing design work to the company's Experimental Design Office at Kingston, London. In April 1959, the Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Supply</b> formally issued a contract for {{the completion of a}} pair of P.1127 prototypes. However, there were critics amongst the Air Staff of the project, typically disliking the P.1127 for its subsonic speeds, favouring supersonic-capable aircraft instead; Mason attributes this as having caused considerable delay in the issuing of a contract to Hawker. On 23 July 1959, Hawker authorised the application of maximum effort to complete the development of the P.1127.|$|E
5|$|In September 1943, the Chief of Army Service Forces, Lieutenant General Brehon B.

In September 1957 the Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Supply</b> informed the heads of the aviation companies that the only acceptable proposals would be those issued from teams consisting of more than one company. There were a large number of competing aircraft manufacturing companies in the UK while orders were decreasing, thus the government intended to foster cooperation between certain companies and encourage mergers.|$|E
5000|$|Supplying the 270,000 men {{trapped in}} the [...] "cauldron" [...] {{required}} 700 tons <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> a day. That would mean 350 Ju52 flights a day into Pitomnik.

The outcome of the airlift was the Luftwaffe's failure to provide its transport units with the tools they needed to maintain an adequate count of operational aircraft - tools that included airfield facilities, supplies, manpower, and even aircraft suited to the prevailing conditions. These factors, taken together, prevented the Luftwaffe from effectively employing the full potential of its transport forces, ensuring that {{they were unable to}} deliver the quantity <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> needed to sustain the 6th Army.|$|R
