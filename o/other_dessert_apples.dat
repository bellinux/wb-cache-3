40|$|Understanding the {{processes}} that occurred during domestication {{remains one of the}} central questions in genetics. In addition to fundamental importance, it can indeed provide knowledge on the genetic bases for further crop improvement. As an example, apple {{is one of the most}} important fruit crops in temperate regions, having both an economic and a cultural value. <b>Dessert</b> <b>apples</b> are used for consumption as fruits while cider apples are used to produce cider. Yet few traits are known to be different, despite overlapping between <b>dessert</b> and cider <b>apples,</b> namely fruit size and bitterness. A population genomics approach was used for detecting loci involved in the differentiation between cider and <b>dessert</b> <b>apples,</b> on two core collections of old cultivars, one for <b>dessert</b> <b>apples</b> and one for cider apples. A set of 96 gene fragments, localized in 6 areas of the apple genome bearing QTLs for traits of agronomic interest, was re-sequenced and the Illumina 8 K SNP chip was used to genotype these two collections. The low estimates of per locus differentiation (ie Fst) between <b>dessert</b> and cider <b>apples</b> indicated that these two pools recently derive from common ancestors, except for 2 genomic regions exhibiting higher Fst values and potentially involved in selective processes. Departure from neutrality was also tested for each “population” using Tajima’s D and Fu and Li’s D and several areas of the genome were found to have significant decrease of both. Such knowledge could be helpful in new selection programs, bringing their efficiency to a higher level...|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} Unravelling the genomic processes at play during variety diversification is {{of fundamental}} interest for understanding evolution, {{but also of}} applied interest in crop science. It can indeed provide knowledge on the genetic bases of traits for crop improvement and germplasm diversity management. Apple {{is one of the}} most important fruit crops in temperate regions, having both great economic and cultural values. Sweet <b>dessert</b> <b>apples</b> are used for direct consumption while bitter cider apples are used to produce cider. Several important traits are known to differentiate the two variety types, in particular fruit size, biennial versus annual fruit bearing and bitterness, caused by a higher content in polyphenols. Here, we used an Illumina 8 K SNP chip on two core collections, of 48 dessert and 48 cider apples, respectively, for identifying genomic regions responsible for the differences between cider and <b>dessert</b> <b>apples.</b> The genome-wide level of genetic differentiation between cider and <b>dessert</b> <b>apples</b> was low, although 17 candidate regions showed signatures of divergent selection, displaying either outlier FST values or significant association with phenotypic traits (bitter versus sweet fruits). These candidate regions encompassed 420 genes involved in a variety of functions and metabolic pathways, including several colocalizations with QTLs for polyphenol compounds. </p...|$|R
