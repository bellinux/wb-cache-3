The interrelation {{of the arts}} is also stressed. All students take at least <b>one</b> <b>course</b> in each major area. A dancer, for example, {{will be required to}} study visual art, drama, and music.|$|E
5|$|Before leaving office, Mahathir had {{condemned}} Malays who {{relied on}} their privileges. Abdullah continued this, warning Malays {{to learn to}} live without crutches or end up in wheelchairs. His administration began the practice of meritocracy, which Mahathir had tentatively proposed, and university admissions quotas were eliminated. However, some charged that this did not eliminate discrimination in education. The pre-university stream was divided into two; <b>one</b> <b>course</b> prepared students for the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM) standardised examination, lasting two years, while the other comprised various matriculation courses graded by individual lecturers, typically lasting a year.|$|E

50|$|The general {{principle}} was, when the Sun {{is to the}} right or left of <b>one's</b> <b>course</b> <b>one</b> can check <b>one's</b> <b>course</b> but not <b>one's</b> distance to the destination.

This technique allowed him to find tiny islands in the Pacific. He was awarded the inaugural Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators Johnston Memorial Trophy for this trip.

At {{the time of the}} bombing, Vonnegut had not appreciated the sheer scale of destruction in Dresden; his enlightenment came only slowly as information dribbled out, and based on early figures he came to believe that 135,000 had died there.|$|E

If they wish to study further for at MBA they must take it from a university in Denmark, i.e. the Aarhus University.|$|E
5|$|No.5 SFTS began flight {{training}} in February 1942 using 28 Wirraways. The unit grew {{over the next}} two years, and by early 1944 was operating 128 Wirraways, two de Havilland DH.84 Dragons, two de Havilland Moth Minors and a CAC Wackett. It typically graduated <b>one</b> <b>course</b> of pilots each month, although the wastage rate sometimes exceeded 40 per cent. Among its graduates was Len Waters, the first Aboriginal Australian military aviator, and the only one to serve as a fighter pilot in the RAAF during World WarII. As a training facility, No.5 SFTS regularly suffered flying accidents. Forty-two of its students died during the war, an average of around one per month. A near miss involving more experienced pilots occurred at the school in December 1943, when aces Clive Caldwell and John Waddy, then instructors at No.2 Operational Training Unit in Mildura, almost collided when they crossed paths during an aerobatics display over the base.|$|E

Kannan took over the first position on the 171st lap, before Junqueira passed him on the next lap. A section of front wing became disloged from Moreno's car while entering turn three on lap 176, which triggered the fourth caution. During the caution, CART Chief Stewart Chris Kneifel announced the distance of the event would be reduced from 250 to 230 laps because of fading sunlight, and the leaders elected to make pit stops. Moreno remained the leader at the lap-183 restart but was overtaken by Junqueira in turn one. After restarting third, Tagliani fell to sixth.
