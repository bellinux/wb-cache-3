The present study aimed to investigate the volumetric development of the human bulb and the olfactory function during childhood and youth. Furthermore, the present study aimed to investigate a possible correlation between <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> specific olfactory functions including odor threshold, odor discrimination and odor identification. A total of 87 subjects (46 boys, 41 girls), aged 1 - 17  years (mean age 8  years), participated in this study. None of them reported olfactory dysfunction or had signs of a dysfunctional sense of smell. Whenever possible, participants received a volumetric scan of the brain and lateralized olfactory tests. Volumetric measurements of the right and left OB were taken by manual segmentation of the coronal slices through the OB. Significant correlations between <b>OB</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>and</b> olfactory function were observed. Both, <b>OB</b> <b>volumes</b> <b>and</b> olfactory function increased with age, although the correlation between structure and function was not mediated by the subjects' age. In conclusion, for the first time, the present study showed a correlation between <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> olfactory functions in children...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether differences in olfactory function between healthy individuals and patients with olfactory loss could be detected by various diagnostic tests. DESIGN: Psychophysical testing of orthonasal and retronasal olfactory functions, {{magnetic resonance imaging}} of olfactory bulb (<b>OB)</b> <b>volume,</b> <b>and</b> chemosensory event-related potential (ERP) measurement performed between January 1, 2005, and October 31, 2005. SETTING: Academic tertiary referral medical center. PATIENTS: Eleven healthy individuals with normal olfactory function (NL) and 11 patients with nasal polyposis (NP), 11 with posttraumatic olfactory loss (PT), and 11 with postinfectious olfactory loss (PI) were included in this study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Orthonasal and retronasal olfactory test results, magnetic resonance imaging-based <b>OB</b> <b>volume,</b> <b>and</b> ERPs to both olfactory and intranasal trigeminal stimulation. RESULTS: Orthonasal and retronasal testing revealed that NL individuals had higher scores than patients with NP, PT, or PI. Retronasal scores were higher in NP patients compared with PT and PI patients. The <b>OB</b> <b>volumes</b> were higher in NL individuals compared with NP, PT, and PI patients. The <b>OB</b> <b>volumes</b> in PT patients were significantly lower than those from NP and PI patients. Olfactory ERPs were different between NL individuals and NP, PT, and PI patients, and trigeminal ERPs were significantly different when comparing NL individuals with NP patients. For the entire cohort, a significant correlation was found between orthonasal testing <b>and</b> <b>OB</b> <b>volume,</b> between retronasal testing <b>and</b> <b>OB</b> <b>volume,</b> <b>and</b> between both orthonasal and retronasal testing and olfactory ERP amplitudes. Olfactory ERPs were recorded in the 11 NL individuals and in 3 NP, 3 PT, and 4 PI patients, defined as responders. Orthonasal and retronasal test scores, <b>OB</b> <b>volume,</b> <b>and</b> olfactory ERPs were significantly larger in responders compared with nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in various tests that evaluate olfactory function were detectable in a cohort of NL individuals and NP, PT, and PI patients. This finding suggests that these diagnostic tools provide information {{in terms of the}} clinical assessment of olfactory function. Future studies will investigate their combined use in terms of the prognosis of olfactory function in patients with olfactory loss...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the olfactory bulb (OB) and sulcus (OS) in a large group of patients who have been well-characterized in terms of olfactory function, with a specific focus on the comparison between patients with olfactory loss due to chronic rhinosinusitis, head trauma, or acute infections. A retrospective study of 378 patients with olfactory loss was performed. Orthonasal olfactory function was assessed with the"Sniffin' Sticks" test kit, including tests for odor threshold, odor discrimination, and odor identification. Magnetic resonance imaging analyses were focused on <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> OS depth. Major results of the present study included the (1) demonstration of a correlation between olfactory function <b>and</b> <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> across the various pathologies in a very large group of subjects; (2) the three functional tests exhibited a similar degree of correlation with <b>OB</b> <b>volume.</b> (3) The right, but not the left OS correlated with olfactory function; in addition, (4) OS was negatively correlated with age. In contrast to OS, (5) no side differences were found for the OB. Finally, (6) the three different causes of olfactory loss exhibited different patterns of results for the three olfactory tests. The present data suggest that the morphological assessment of the <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> OS depth produces useful clinical indicators of olfactory dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether the degree of postinfectious olfactory loss is reflected in volume of the olfactory bulb (OB). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of 26 patients with postinfectious olfactory loss. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Olfactory function was assessed with the "Sniffin' Sticks" test kit, and the magnetic resonance imaging study focused on <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> the olfactory sulcus. RESULTS: The study revealed that 1) <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> varies with regard to olfactory function, 2) <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> decreases with duration of olfactory loss, and 3) patients with parosmia had smaller <b>OB</b> <b>volumes</b> than patients who did not report such smell distortions, although their overall olfactory function was {{not significantly different from}} each other.

40|$|The human {{olfactory}} bulb (OB) {{is the first}} relay station of the olfactory pathway and may {{have the potential for}} postnatal neurogenesis in early childhood. In animals, chronic stress affects the OB and olfactory functioning. For humans, {{it has been shown that}} major depressive disorder is accompanied by reduced <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> reduced olfactory function. However, it is not clear if major stress in childhood development also affects olfactory functioning <b>and</b> <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> in humans. <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> was measured <b>and</b> olfactory function was tested in 17 depressive patients with and 10 without a history of severe childhood maltreatment (CM). CM patients exhibited a significantly reduced olfactory threshold and identification ability. The <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> of the CM patients was significantly reduced to 80 % of the non-CM patients. In conclusion, postnatal neurogenesis might be by reduced in CM, which may affect olfactory function of the brain in later life. Alternatively, a reduced <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> may enhance psychological vulnerability in the presence of adverse childhood conditions although other areas not analyzed in this study may also be involved...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the volume of the {{olfactory}} bulb (OB) changes with function. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> the olfactory function in early blind (EB) subjects increase compared with controls. Psychophysical testing of olfactory performances and OB volumetric measurements assessed by an MRI scan were studied. Quantitative olfactory function expressed in the odor discrimination and odor-free identification scores was higher in EB subjects compared with controls. The mean of right, left <b>and</b> total <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> was 65. 40, 75. 48, and 140. 89 [*]mm, respectively for the EB subjects and 54. 47, 52. 11, and 106. 60 [*]mm, respectively for the controls, with these differences being significant. EB subjects have superior olfactory abilities and presented with significantly higher <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> than the sighted controls.

40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between olfactory function, rhinencephalon and forebrain changes in Kallmann syndrome (KS) {{have not been}} adequately investigated. We evaluated a large cohort of male KS patients using Sniffin' Sticks and MRI in order to study olfactory bulb (<b>OB)</b> <b>volume,</b> olfactory sulcus (OS) depth, cortical thickness close to the OS, and olfactory phenotype. Methods: Olfaction was assessed administering Sniffin' Sticks®, in 38 KS patients and 17 controls (by means of Screening 12 test®). All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study <b>OB</b> <b>volume,</b> sulcus depth, <b>and</b> cortical thickness. Results: Compared to controls, KS patients showed smaller <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> (p< 0. 0001), reduced sulcus depth (p< 0. 0001), and thicker cortex in the region close to the OS (p< 0. 0001). Anosmic KS patients had smaller OB than controls and hyposmic KS patients; {{there was no difference}} between hyposmic KS patients <b>and</b> controls. <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> correlated with Sniffin' Sticks score (r = 0. 64; p < 0. 001), OS depth (p< 0. 0001) and, inversely, with cortical thickness changes (p< 0. 0001). Sniffin' Sticks showed an inverse correlation with cortical thickness (r = - 0. 5; p< 0. 0001) and a trend toward a statistically significant correlation with OS depth. Conclusion: The present study provides further evidence of the strict {{relationship between}} olfaction <b>and</b> <b>OB</b> <b>volume.</b> The strong correlation between <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> the overlying cortical changes highlights the key role of rhinencephalon in forebrain embryogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{olfactory}} bulb (<b>OB)</b> <b>volume,</b> olfactory brain <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> the number <b>and</b> <b>volume</b> of MS lesions were assessed by MRI. Aim {{of the study}} was to explore reasons for and optimize the detection of olfactory dysfunction in MS patients. Olfactory function was tested using the Threshold-Discrimination-Identification-Test (TDI), gustatory function was tested using Taste Strips (TST). Objective olfactometry was performed by measuring olfactory evoked potentials. 57 patients (36 MS patients, 12 patients with optic neuritis, 9 patients with neuromyelitis optica) and 30 control persons were examined. MS patients displayed more frequently hyposmia in the subjective and objective olfactometry compared with the control group. There was a correlation between the <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> the number <b>and</b> <b>volume</b> of MS lesions in the olfactory brain. In patients with a decreased <b>OB</b> <b>volume,</b> there was a correlation between volumetry of the OB and the olfactory function. The olfactory brain volumes of MS patients with primary and secondary progressive form were lesser than those with relapsing-remitting form. We could detect a correlation between olfactory function and physical disability in MS patients. <b>OB</b> <b>volumes</b> may provide valuable information about MS patients with olfactory dysfunction. The correlation between a higher number <b>and</b> <b>volume</b> of MS lesions with a decreased <b>OB</b> <b>and</b> olfactory brain <b>volume</b> could help to explain olfactory dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the volume of the {{olfactory}} bulb (OB) in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (without nasal polyposis at the endoscopic evaluation) and to evaluate the correlation between this measure and the degree of sinonasal inflammation. METHODS: Patients with sinonasal disease (SND; n = 22) were compared with healthy controls (n = 16) using orthonasal and retronasal olfactory test results <b>and</b> <b>OB</b> <b>volumes</b> measurement calculated by planimetric manual contouring using standardized methods. The Lund-Mackay score (originally described for CT scan) was also used to gauge sinonasal inflammation (SND score). RESULTS: The two groups were not significantly different in terms of age or distribution of sex. Patients had significantly higher right- and left-sided SND scores than controls. There was no significant group difference between patients and controls with regard to <b>OB</b> <b>volume.</b> However, patients with an SND score < or = 12 had larger <b>OB</b> <b>volumes</b> than patients with higher SND scores (p < 0. 001). Even when controlling for the subjects' age, a significant correlation was present between <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> SND score (r = - 0. 52; p = 0. 001) with smaller <b>OB</b> <b>volumes</b> being associated with a higher degree of sinonasal pathology. CONCLUSION: <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> correlated with the SND score, which is an indicator of the degree of sinonasal inflammation. SND patients with a slight decrease or even normal olfactory function may already exhibit changes in their <b>OB</b> <b>volume.</b> This study also seems to emphasize the idea that <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> changes are more sensitive to subtle changes in the olfactory system than results from psychophysical testing...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} olfactory function with orthonasal and retronasal testing in patients with posttraumatic olfactory loss and to investigate the relation between residual olfactory function <b>and</b> olfactory bulb (<b>OB)</b> <b>volume.</b> METHOD: A retrospective study of 25 patients with posttraumatic olfactory loss was performed. Orthonasal olfactory function was assessed with the Sniffin' Sticks test kit; retronasal olfactory function was assessed with intraorally applied odors. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> cortical damage in the frontal and temporal areas. RESULTS: The main outcomes of the present study were the demonstration of a correlation between olfactory function <b>and</b> <b>OB</b> <b>volume,</b> which was more pronounced for retronasal than for orthonasal olfactory function; retronasal olfactory function was most affected in the patients with the most extensive cerebral damage and was least compromised in patients without such damage; <b>OB</b> <b>volumes</b> were smaller in patients with parosmia compared with those without; and the presence of parosmia was clearly associated with the presence of cerebral damage. CONCLUSION: The data confirm that <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> is an indicator of olfactory function but, interestingly, in this study, it is largely determined by retronasal olfactory sensitivity. In addition, these results emphasize the role of higher cortical centers in olfactory function, and especially in parosmia, which may, at least in some cases, be related to lesions in the fronto-orbital and anterior temporal cortices. It would be of interest to investigate <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> further in relation to the prognosis of the disorder...|$|R
40|$|Background: Olfactory {{dysfunction}} in MS {{patients is}} {{reported in the}} literature. MRI of the olfactory bulb (OB) is discussed as a promising new testing method for measuring olfactory function (OF). Aim {{of this study was}} to explore reasons for and optimize the detection of olfactory dysfunction in MS patients with MRI. Materials and Methods: <b>OB</b> <b>and</b> olfactory brain <b>volume</b> was assessed within 34 MS patients by manual segmentation. Olfactory function was tested using the Threshold-Discrimination-Identification-Test (TDI), gustatory function was tested using Taste Strips (TST). Results: 41 % of the MS patients displayed olfactory dysfunction (8 % of the control group), 16 % displayed gustatory dysfunction (5 % of the control group). There was a correlation between the <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> the number <b>and</b> <b>volume</b> of MS lesions in the olfactory brain. Olfactory brain volume correlated with the volume of lesions in the olfactory brain and the EDSS score.

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to explore whether the <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> was significantly different between PD patients and healthy controls. PubMed and Embase were searched up to March 6, 2015 with no language restrictions. Two independent reviewers screened eligible studies and extracted data on study characteristics <b>and</b> <b>OB</b> <b>volume.</b> Additionally, a systematic review and meta-analysis using a random-effects model were conducted. Publication bias was determined by using funnel plots and Begg's and Egger's tests. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess possible sources of heterogeneity. Six original case-control studies of 216 PD patients and 175 healthy controls were analyzed. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) in the <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> between the PD patients and the healthy participants was - 8. 071 for the right OB and - 10. 124 for the left OB; these values indicated a significant difference among PD patients compared with healthy controls. In addition, {{a significant difference in the}} lateralized <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> was observed in PD patients, with a pooled WMD of 1. 618; these results indicated a larger right <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> than left <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> in PD patients. In contrast, no difference in the lateralized <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> was found in healthy controls. No statistical evidence of publication bias among studies was found based on Egger's or Begg's tests. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the results were consistent and robust.

40|$|The {{volume of}} the {{olfactory}} bulb (OB) is strongly reduced in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and this group exhibits markedly decreased olfactory function. It {{has been suggested that}} olfactory input is important for maintaining balance in limbic neurocircuits. The aim of our study was to investigate whether reduced <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> is associated with response to therapy in MDD. Twenty-four inpatients (all women, age 21 - 49  years, mean 38 [*]±[*] 10  years SD) with MDD and 36 healthy controls (all women, age 20 - 52  years, mean 36 [*]±[*] 10  years SD) underwent structural MRI. <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> was compared between responders (N[*]=[*] 13) and non-responders (N[*]=[*] 11) to psychotherapy.

40|$|Ebf 1 is a {{transcription}} factor essential for B cell fate specification and function and {{important for the}} development of olfactory sensory neurons. We show here that Ebf 1 also {{plays an important role in}} regulating osteoblast and adipocyte development in vivo. Ebf 1 mRNA and protein is expressed in MSCs, in OBs at most stages of differentiation, and in adipocytes. Tibiae and femora from Ebf 1 −/− mice had a striking increase in all bone formation parameters examined including the number of <b>OBs,</b> osteoid <b>volume,</b> <b>and</b> bone formation rate. Serum osteocalcin, a marker of bone formation, was significantly elevated in mutant mice. The numbers of osteoclasts in bone were normal in younger (4 week-old) Ebf 1 −/ − mice but increased in older (12 week-old) Ebf 1 −/ − mice. This correlated well with in vitro osteoclast development from bone marrow cells. In addition to the increased osteoblastogenesis, there was a dramatic increase in adipocyte numbers in the bone marrow of Ebf 1 −/ − mice. Increased adiposity was also seen histologically in the liver but not in the spleen of these mice, and accompanied by decreased deposition of adipose to subcutaneous sites.

40|$|Repeated {{exposure}} to odors modifies olfactory function. Consequently, "olfactory training" plays {{a significant role}} in hyposmia treatment. In addition, numerous studies show that the olfactory bulb (<b>OB)</b> <b>volume</b> changes in disorders associated with olfactory dysfunction. Aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether and how olfactory bulb volume changes in relation to lateralized olfactory training in healthy people. Over a period of 4  months, 97 healthy participants (63 females and 34 males, mean age: 23. 74  ±  4. 16  years, age range: 19 - 43  years) performed olfactory training by exposing the same nostril twice a day to 4 odors (lemon, rose, eucalyptus and cloves) while closing the other nostril.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Post-traumatic {{olfactory}} loss (PTOL) is {{the third}} most common aetiology for olfactory disorders. Mechanisms that lead to post-traumatic olfactory disorders include sinonasal affections, damage to the olfactory nerve and lesions of the cerebral olfactory centres. The purpose of this review is to present an update of this condition and to present a cohort study of 90 patients. METHODOLOGY: A {{review of the literature}} was made on Medline Pubmed up to May 2009 and a review was also conducted of patients with post-traumatic olfactory loss. RESULTS: The degree of olfactory impairment was related to the severity of head trauma and was particularly frequent in cases of occipital impact. Typically, patients experienced a sudden onset of olfactory symptoms and were more severely affected than in other aetiologies. Results from orthonasal and retronasal testing, chemosensory event-related potentials <b>and</b> olfactory bulb (<b>OB)</b> <b>volume</b> confirmed previous findings: patients are usually anosmic, <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> correlates with the degree of olfactory loss (better correlation with retronasal scores than with orthonasal scores) and olfactory event-related potentials were recorded in only 18 patients.

Failing treatment, complete evaluation of the PTOL patients may help in counselling for the recovery prognosis, and appropriate counselling must be given to secure the environment and alimentation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Possibly due to {{the small}} size of the {{olfactory}} bulb (OB) as compared to rodents, it was generally believed that songbirds lack a well-developed sense of smell. This belief was recently revised by several studies showing that various bird species, including passerines, use olfaction in many respects of life. During courtship and nest building, male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) incorporate aromatic herbs that are rich in volatile compounds (e. g., milfoil, Achillea millefolium) into the nests and they use olfactory cues to identify these plants. Interestingly, European starlings show seasonal differences in their ability to respond to odour cues: odour sensitivity peaks during nest-building in the spring, but is almost non-existent during the non-breeding season. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study used repeated in vivo Manganese-enhanced MRI to quantify for the first time possible seasonal changes in the anatomy and activity of the OB in starling brains. We demonstrated that the OB of the starling exhibits a functional seasonal plasticity of certain plant odour specificity and that the OB is only able to detect milfoil odour during the breeding season. Volumetric analysis showed that this seasonal change in activity is not linked to a change in <b>OB</b> <b>volume.</b> By subsequently experimentally elevating testosterone (T) in half of the males during the nonbreeding season we showed that the <b>OB</b> <b>volume</b> was increased compared to controls.

Cell death of olfactory receptor neurons and proliferation of stem cells in the olfactory epithelium were immediately increased following lesion. New olfactory receptor neurons repopulated the olfactory epithelium and once again showed functional responses to natural odorants within 1 week after transection. Reinnervation of the olfactory bulb (OB) by newly formed olfactory receptor neuron axons also began at this time.

Trading <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> open interest represent market information for investors. This study uses three different definitions of volatility: (1) daily volatility measured by close-to-close returns, (2) non-trading volatility measured by close-to-open returns, and (3) trading volatility measured by open-to-close returns. The impact of trading <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> open interest on price volatility is investigated. Following Bessembinder <b>and</b> Seguin (1993), <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> open interest are divided into expected and unexpected components. The GARCH (1, 1) model is employed using expected and unexpected components of trading activity (<b>volume</b> <b>and</b> open interest) as explanatory variables. The results show a positive contemporaneous relationship between expected <b>and</b> unexpected trading <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> volatility, while open interest mitigates volatility.

40|$|Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) {{is closely}} {{associated}} with olfactory loss. Deficits {{in the sense of}} smell may precede clinical motor symptoms by years. Although there is more and more evidence from recent studies to support this view, it remains unclear which substrates would cause the olfactory deficit. Studies based on biopsies from the olfactory epithelium did not reveal specific changes in the nasal mucosa of PD patients compared to patients who were hyposmic for other reasons. Thus, PD-related olfactory impairment seems not to be directly associated with specific changes in the olfactory epithelium. With regard to volumetrics of the olfactory bulb (OB) results indicated that {{there is little or no}} difference between PD patients and healthy controls in terms of <b>OB</b> <b>volume.</b> Again, these data support the idea that olfactory loss in PD is not a consequence of damage to the olfactory epithelium but rather results from central-nervous changes. Finally, studies based on functional MRI suggested that neuronal activity in the amygdala and hippocampus is reduced in PD patients compared to controls which may specifically impact on olfactory function. In addition, neuronal activity in components of cortico-striatal loops appears to be up-regulated indicating compensatory processes involving the dopaminergic system. Thus, it seems that cerebral changes, and not changes at the level of the olfactory epithelium, are the basis of the olfactory loss observed in PD patients...|$|R

The <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> variance tests are conducted on the S&P 500 and NASDAQ from January 1990 to March 2008 (n= 4, 558). The {{results suggest that the}} profitability of the CSA is enhanced when employing either volume or variance into the trading model. Jointly employing <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> variance was not able to provide a significant improvement in profits over the employment of volume or variance alone; this is partially the result of the correlation between <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> variance...|$|R

40|$|The {{empirical}} evidence on investor disagreement <b>and</b> trading <b>volume</b> {{is difficult to}} reconcile in standard rational expectations models. We develop a dynamic model in which investors disagree about the interpretation of public information. We obtain a closed-form linear equilibrium {{that allows us to}} study which restrictions on the disagreement process yield empirically observed <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> return dynamics. We show that when investors have infrequent but major disagreements, there is positive autocorrelation in <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> positive correlation between <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> volatility. We also derive novel empirical predictions that relate the degree and frequency of disagreement to <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> volatility dynamics.

40|$|Trading <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> {{the number}} of trades are both used as proxies for market activity, with {{disagreement}} as to which is the better proxy for market activity. This paper investigates this issue using high frequency data for Cisco and Intel in 1997. A number of econometric methods are used, including GARCH augmented with lagged trading <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> number of trades, tests based on moment restrictions, regression analysis of volatility on <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> trades, normality of returns when standardized by <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> number of trades, and Correlation analysis using volatility generated from GARCH and realized volatility. Our results show that {{the number of}} trades is the better proxy for market activity. ...|$|R

30|$|The modeled {{deflation}} <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> rate {{associated with}} each sub-Plinian eruption act as good indicators of eruption scale and effusion rate. Since {{the data were collected}} in real time, rapid estimations of the deflation volume can be used as immediate constraints on the <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> scale of an eruption, which will aid hazard assessment and disaster response. We note that the deflation <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> rate are not equal to erupted <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> rate of discharge of lava from the vent, respectively; such relations depend on the elastic properties and bubble content of magma. Precise estimation of erupted <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> discharge rate of each eruption was conducted by Kozono et al. (2013). They combined the temporal volumetric change of the magma chamber estimated by the geodetic data during the eruption with that of accumulating lava in the crater measured by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images during the continuous lava effusion. Based on the comparison of these estimated temporal changes of volume, they estimated dense-rock equivalent <b>volumes</b> <b>and</b> discharge rates of magma during the three sub-Plinian eruptions considering magma compressibility <b>and</b> <b>volume</b> variation of a bubble-bearing magma.|$|R
