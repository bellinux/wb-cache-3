Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage. There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45cm) cabinets in a typical concert system. Just as consumer subwoofer enclosures can be made of Medium-density fibreboard (MDF), <b>Oriented</b> <b>strand</b> <b>board</b> (<b>OSB),</b> plywood, plastic or other dense material, professional subwoofer enclosures can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28mm birch-faced oak plywood. Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18–20mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) plywood from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures. Not naturally weatherproof, Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the subwoofer enclosures greater durability.|$|E

In the construction industries, they have the potential to replace the wood and <b>oriented</b> <b>strand</b> <b>boards</b> (<b>OSB)</b> laminates in the structural insulated panels (SIPs). They possess numerous advantages over traditional OSB SIPs such as being environmental friendly, recyclable, energy efficient, inherently flood resistant, and having higher strength and wind resistance. This paper mainly focuses on the manufacturing feasibility and structural characterization of natural fiber reinforced structural insulated panels (NSIPs) using natural fiber reinforced polymeric (NFRP) laminates as skin. To account for the use of natural fibers, the pretreatments are required on natural fibers prior to use in NFRP laminates, and, to address this issue properly, the natural fibers were given bleaching pretreatments. To this end, flexure test and low-velocity impact (LVI) tests were carried out on NSIPs in order to evaluate the response of NSIPs under sudden impact loading and uniform bending conditions typical of residential construction. The paper also includes a comparison of mechanical properties of NSIPs with OSB SIPs and G/PP SIPs. The results showed significant increase in the mechanical properties of resulting NSIP panels mainly a 53 % increase in load-carrying capacity compared to OSB SIPs. The bending modulus of NSIPs is 190 % higher than OSB SIPs and 70 % weight reduction compared to OSB SIPs...|$|R
40|$|Research {{to improve}} {{dimensional}} stability of <b>oriented</b> <b>strand</b> <b>boards</b> (<b>OSB)</b> through thermal treatment has been done. It aims {{to reduce the}} higroscopicity of the wood particles {{as well as to}} relieve the compression stresses generated during pressing process. In spite of the advantages, the thermal treatment above 160 ºC can inactive the surface of the wood, reducing the penetration of the adhesive and, this way, reducing the quality of the adhesion. The sanding of the surface of OSB panels can remove this effect, increasing the quality of the adhesion and the glue line strength. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the thermal treatment on the glue-line shear strength of OSB panels and the effect of the sanding process on this strength, as well. Commercial OSB were thermally treated according to two temperature levels (190 and 220 ºC), three times (12, 16 and 20 minutes). Eighty-four samples were cut, both of them were sanded before the gluing (resorcinol-formaldehyde, 360 g/m²). The glue-line shear strength testing was conducted according to ASTM D 1037 standard. The results reveled that the proposed thermal treatment reduced slightly the shear strength The interaction factor between temperature and time on these results wasidentified.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine the sensory and irritative effects caused by emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from pine wood and <b>oriented</b> <b>strand</b> <b>boards</b> (<b>OSB)</b> using a controlled human exposure trial. Methods: 15 volunteers were investigated for effects caused by pine wood and 24 volunteers for effects caused by OSB. Each subject was exposed in a 48 m³ test chamber under various exposure conditions 5 times, each for the period of 2 h. The air exchange rate was 1 /h. The volunteers exercised on a cycle ergometer at 50 W throughout the entire experiment. Temperature, relative humidity, CO 2 and VOC concentrations were measured continuously. Sensory effects and irritation of eyes, nose and throat, lung function (FVC, FEV), exhaled nitrogen oxide (NO) concentration, eve blinking frequency, and smell evaluation were recorded before, during and after exposure. Standardized visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to record the volunteer´s subjective physical state. Psychometric questionnaires were used [Freiburger Persönlichkeitsinventar (FLZ) ] to exclude influence of personality traits on the subjective VAS ratings. Odour perception was studied by the "semantic differential (SD) " questionnaire. Results: No evidence for adverse effects on eye, nose, throat, upper airway irritation or lung function was found after 2 -h exposure to VOC levels of up to 13, 000 µg/m³. In addition eye blinking frequency as a parameter for mucosal irritation was not affected during or after exposure. The only detectable effect caused by exposure to pine wood and OSB emissions was a significant perception of odour. However, using SD, the odour of both pine wood and OSB was rated as being more "pleasant" than "unpleasant". Conclusions: The result of our study showed that exposure to rather high VOC concentrations (9000 - 13000 µg/m³) released from pine wood or OSB does not elicit sensory irritation or pulmonary effects in healthy humans. On the basis of our study, adverse health effects on eyes and airways are not to be expected under ordinary indoor air conditions and given appropriate wood and OSB installation...|$|R
40|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) {{estimates}} that buildings account for 40 % {{of the global}} energy use. The IPCC believes substantial improvements to building efficiency can be implemented easily by improving building enclosures through increased levels of insulation, optimizing glazing areas and minimizing infiltration of outside air. Building enclosure design encompasses {{a wide range of}} parameters but the transport of heat, air and moisture through the enclosure is of primary importance. In predominantly cold Canadian climates, adequate thermal insulation, effective air barriers, and proper moisture control are crucial for energy savings and durability of the structure. For decades, standard construction practice in Canada dictated a polyethylene sheet behind the interior drywall layer to serve as a vapour barrier for assemblies with traditional fibre-based cavity insulation. If the polyethylene sheet was sealed carefully enough it had the added benefit of reducing air leakage. Unfortunately, vapour barriers place the emphasis on the wrong moisture transport mechanism; air leakage can have 10 times or greater the wetting potential than vapour diffusion. Regardless, code enforcement personnel continued (and continue in some areas) to require vapour barriers in all climates, all assemblies, and all occupancies. To do so, they overrule the provision in Part 5 of The National Building Code of Canada that states vapour barriers are not required if it can be shown that the uncontrolled vapour diffusion will not affect the operation of the building and systems, or {{the health and safety of}} the occupants. Foam plastic insulations perform better than fibre-based insulation in terms of the combined resistance to transmission of heat, air and vapour. This research investigated several types of open cell and closed cell spray polyurethane foam insulation in a variety of assembly configurations both in lab tests and hygrothermal simulations. The simulations were extrapolated to seven Canadian climate categories and three levels of interior relative humidity. The goal was to determine which spray polyurethane foam applications required the addition of a dedicated vapour barrier layer beyond what the foam itself could provide. The moisture content of the <b>oriented</b> <b>strand</b> <b>board</b> sheathing layer (<b>OSB)</b> in the tested and modelled assemblies was used as the performance evaluation point because during wintertime vapour drives, the wood sheathing is the most likely condensing surface. Prolonged high moisture content (greater than 20 %) in wood and wood products in wall assemblies leads to mould growth and decay. By this measure, if the wood sheathing moisture contents stay within the safe range (less than 19 %) a vapour barrier is not necessary. The results are presented in Table 7 - 4. The performance of assemblies containing closed cell spray foam was excellent for all climates and humidity levels. Their performance was equivalent to traditional wall assemblies incorporating a polyethylene sheet vapour barrier. The performance of assemblies with open cell spray foam was equivalent to traditional wall assemblies containing no vapour barrier. Open cell spray foam and fibreglass batt both require additional vapour control layers with all but the mildest Canadian climates with the lowest interior humidities. However, in those mild climates with low interior humidities, the only vapour control layer required was a medium permeance latex paint with primer. <br...|$|R
