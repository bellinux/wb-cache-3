30|$|The {{impacts of}} natural hazard-induced {{disasters}} have significant macroeconomic consequences. Numerous {{studies have been}} conducted to understand the influence of social, political, financial, and policy-related factors <b>on</b> the <b>economic</b> growth of countries. Headey and Hodge (2009) analyzed the effect of population growth <b>on</b> country-level <b>economic</b> growth. Momota (2009) developed a theoretical population-macroeconomic growth model to study the effects of fertility, child education, and education policies <b>on</b> the future <b>economic</b> growth of developing countries. Tang and Abosedra (2014) conducted a panel data analysis on 24 Middle East and North African countries to analyze the impacts of tourism, energy consumption, and political instability <b>on</b> their <b>economic</b> growth. Qayyum and Haider (2012) extended the neoclassical growth model of Solow–Swan (Dowrick and Rogers 2002) to investigate the effect of institutional quality, that is, governance, financial debt, and foreign aid <b>on</b> the <b>economic</b> growth of low-income countries. Aisen and Veiga (2013) and Jong-A-Pin (2009) investigated the effects of political instability <b>on</b> the <b>economic</b> growth of countries using a panel data analysis approach and found that a higher degree of political instability is associated with a lower growth rate. Although this literature is not exhaustive, it is evident that the study of growth econometrics is an important topic that needs further attention.|$|R
