5|$|From 1643 to 1659, {{he served}} as master mason for the {{construction}} of Heriot's Hospital (now a school), succeeding William Aytoun. The building had been started in 1628 by William Wallace, and would not be finally completed until 1700; Mylne rebuilt <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the towers in 1648. Also in 1648, Mylne was engaged to repair the crown steeple of St. Giles'.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{of those}} two {{companies}} actually did the construction work. That job was handed off {{to a series of}} subcontractors, each of whom had responsibility on <b>one</b> (<b>or</b> <b>two)</b> <b>of</b> six sections of the pipeline (seven, if the marine terminal is included). Bidding on the subcontracting jobs opened at the end of March, and the contracts were announced on June 12, 1974.|$|E
5|$|The OBRC Checklist {{divides the}} {{province}} into the Lowlands, Central, and South review zones and requests documentation of sightings of birds which are rare or accidental in one, two, {{or all of}} the zones. Of the 496 species on the list, 167 are noted as rare anywhere in the province and another 108 are rare in <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the zones. Eight species have been introduced to North America. One species has been extirpated, one is extinct, and another might be.|$|E

5|$|During this time, Patterson {{engaged in}} a gun duel with the Japanese column. Patterson {{received}} a shell hit aft, causing moderate damage and killing 10 crew members. Patterson continued to pursue and fire at the Japanese ships and may have hit Kinugasa, causing moderate damage. Patterson then {{lost sight of the}} Japanese column as it headed northeast along the eastern shore of Savo Island. Bagley, whose crew sighted the Japanese shortly after Patterson and Canberra, circled completely around to port before firing torpedoes {{in the general direction of}} the rapidly disappearing Japanese column; <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> which may have hit Canberra. Bagley played no further role in the battle. YÅ«nagi exchanged non-damaging gunfire with Jarvis before exiting the battle area to the west with the intention of eventually rejoining the Japanese column north and west of Savo Island.|$|E
5|$|Evolution of the {{adaptive}} immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates. Many of the classical molecules of {{the adaptive}} immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates. However, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates, such as the lamprey and hagfish. These animals possess a large array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced from {{only a small number}} (<b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two)</b> <b>of</b> genes. These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity.|$|E
5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack by <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the opponent's pieces, {{it is said}} to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E

5|$|Andy assembles three applicants: a {{bodybuilder}} from Oscar Martinez's (Oscar Nunez) gym, Dwight's building handyman Nate (Mark Proksch), and a PhD {{candidate who}} can only work {{two days a}} week. Darryl demands anew to be fired, then switches gears: he tells Andy {{to give him the}} manager job, saying he deserves it and wants that or a pink slip. Andy then steps up and bluntly tells Darryl he not only {{is not going to do}} that, but Darryl was not even the runner-up to Andy in the selection process. As he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glenn, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board, and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> Andy's applicants.|$|E

25|$|Fakhr-al-Din {{was taken}} to Constantinople and kept in the Yedikule (Seven Towers) prison for two years. He was then summoned before the sultan.

25|$|After {{the engine}} and {{aircraft}} were in production there were several incidents where <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the high pressure turbine blades failed, forcing the aircraft to make emergency landings. An investigation revealed that the turbine section was suffering from a vibration resonance problem, leading to the turbine blade failures. The blades were strengthened and modified to dampen the vibrations. The engine, and the aircraft, returned to service in 1990.|$|E

The new tower was designed to look as similar as possible to its predecessor, using the salvaged and renovated lantern house, and a new lower section.

25|$|Their tactic was {{to advance}} {{simultaneously}} {{from all sides}} targeting a single central objective. This {{would lead to the}} dispersion of enemy forces and prevent their concentration on any one front. Another important reason for this tactic was that even if <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the attacking columns faced stiff resistance and became unable to break through, then the attack could continue from other flanks. This would also prevent any of the Quresh from escaping.|$|E
25|$|Scientists do {{not know}} the minimum number of {{parameters}} for determination of habitability potential, but they are certain it is greater than <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> the factors in the table below.

25|$|Frames are a {{morphological}} {{device that}} may be unique to sign languages (Liddell 2004).

It is the frame which specifies the number and nature of segments in the resulting sign, while the basic signs it combines with lose all but <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> their original features.|$|E
