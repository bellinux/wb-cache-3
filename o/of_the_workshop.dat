40|$|<b>The</b> {{main subject}} <b>of</b> this thesis is <b>the</b> {{research}} <b>of</b> traditional pottery workshops in present-day Egypt. Pottery workshops producing pottery {{in a traditional}} way are disappearing due to several factors discussed in this thesis. The author decided to study a selection of workshops in Egypt, covering a large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nile Valley: in the Fustat area in Cairo, in the Fayum, at Deir Mawas, and in the Qena-Ballas area. The research is intended to document one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heritage <b>of</b> Egypt on <b>the</b> one hand. On the other hand, <b>the</b> description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> also serves ethnoarchaeological research. By creating a general view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshops,</b> <b>the</b> information gathered with the descriptions, {{can be used to}} interpret archaeological remains of pottery workshops. As a framework to <b>the</b> description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> a chapter is devoted to <b>the</b> production technologies <b>of</b> pottery, <b>the</b> so-called chaîne d’opératoire, to understand the activities usually occurring in a <b>workshop.</b> After that, <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> studying pottery is discussed with special focus on ethnoarchaeological research as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possible study methods. <b>The</b> description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> covers <b>the</b> largest part <b>of</b> this thesis. Every area is described in a separate chapter and per <b>workshop</b> <b>the</b> production technologies and <b>the</b> spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> activities within <b>the</b> <b>workshop</b> are described. <b>The</b> layout and architecture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> are treated as well. After that, one chapter is concerned with <b>the</b> comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> {{in order to create a}} general view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> and <b>the</b> activities therein. From this general discussion it becomes clear that the activities are conducted in the most convenient location in or outside <b>the</b> <b>workshop.</b> Also, certain features and activities appear to have a fixed location within a workshop, while others are not allocated in a specific area. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> this general view of workshops in present-day Egypt to interpret archaeological remains is tested in a case study of site O 45. 1 in el-Amarna. The remains in this area have been identified as pottery workshops and will be compared to <b>the</b> general plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> created in this thesis. As the archaeological remains appeared to be scarce, it proved to be difficult to interpret the architecture and layout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> and <b>the</b> activities conducted in <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> as well as their distribution. <b>The</b> general description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present-day <b>workshops</b> can then be used to fill in <b>the</b> gaps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past as will become clear after the evaluation. Therefore, in <b>the</b> opinion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> author, <b>the</b> description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshops</b> is necessary to document <b>the</b> heritage <b>of</b> Egypt as well as to aid archaeologists in interpreting <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> their research...|$|R
5|$|Late 20th-century {{technical}} examination has shown {{significant differences in}} technique and style between the panels of individual diptychs. The technical inconsistencies {{may be the result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshop</b> system, in which the more prosaic passages were often completed by assistants. A change in style between panels can be seen, according to historian John Hand, because the divine panel was usually based on general designs sold on the open market, with the donor panel added after a patron was found.|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{attended}} the summer workshop at the San Francisco Ballet School in 1998. She and Bradley selected the workshop over offers from the Joffrey Ballet, ABT and Dance Theater of Harlem, among others. Of the programs she auditioned for, only New York City Ballet declined {{to make her}} an offer. San Francisco Ballet, ABT and New York City Ballet are regarded as the three preeminent classical ballet companies in the US. During the six-week workshop at San Francisco, Copeland {{was placed in the}} most advanced classes and was under a full tuition plus expenses scholarship. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshop,</b> she received one of the few offers to continue as a full-time student at the school. She declined the offer because of the encouragement from her mother to return home, the prospect of continuing personal training from the Bradley family and dreams of a subsequent summer with ABT.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} an {{immediate}} success when published– by Beilby and Bewick themselves– in 1797. Just prior to its publication, Bewick published an anthology in 1795 {{on the study of}} character in the Kings and Queens of England. Given the success of the 1797 publication of his bird illustrations, Bewick started work at once on the second volume, Water Birds, but the disagreement over authorship led to a final split with Beilby. Bewick was unable to control his feelings and resolve issues quietly, so the partnership ended, turbulently and expensively, leaving Bewick with his own workshop. Bewick had to pay £20, equivalent to about £20,400 in 2011, in lawyer's fees, and more than £21 for Beilby's share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshop</b> equipment.|$|E

25|$|Vasari {{says that}} Raphael {{eventually}} had a workshop of fifty pupils and assistants, {{many of whom}} later became significant artists in their own right. This was arguably the largest workshop team assembled under any single old master painter, and {{much higher than the}} norm. They included established masters from other parts of Italy, probably working with their own teams as sub-contractors, as well as pupils and journeymen.

High-level pressure from Dee and others followed, and X7579 was quickly adapted, arriving at Christchurch in September 1941. At the time the Mk. VII consisted {{of a large number of}} fairly large equipment boxes that were entirely unsuitable for production use, and Hodgkin expressed his surprise at how well the work progressed in spite of this. The aircraft was ready for testing on 2 October.|$|E

Soon after, team members from the company participated and lead a delegation to 4th International Convention of SPIC MACAY held in IIT Guwahati, Assam, India. In September, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences hosted a three-days theatrical workshops program called 'Dramaship', which featured lectures from the group team members including Azeem Hamid and Faiz Rasool.

25|$|Fred Lip {{tried to}} smooth down the growing discontent. He {{spoke to the}} union workers of {{taylorism}} (scientific management), and proposed {{to increase the number}} of representatives on the comité d'entreprise (works council, the workers' representation in the factory), in order to have younger representatives. Although this was illegal, the union workers agreed, and elections were organized. Although Fred Lip had believed this would allow him more control of the workers, in less than a year all the young representatives joined the CFTC. Fred Lip then submitted a proposal to the inspection du travail (government labor inspection office) which would eliminate all of the sector of the company to which most of the union workers belonged, including Charles Piaget. However, he offered Piaget a promotion, naming him head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshop.</b> For the next year, the workers blocked attempts to eliminate the department, opposing those who tried to move the machines out of the factory.|$|E
25|$|After {{the closure}} of the main works, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshop</b> was used for the {{building}} of Isetta microcars between 1957 and 1964 and some of the land remained in railway use, associated with the stabling of electric multiple unit trains and other maintenance functions. Much of the land later became a large open car park, and was used for a popular market every Sunday morning. Some land on the eastern side was given over to an assortment of retail units including a number of car dealers with temporary structures being the predominant building type, and a strip below the yard was used for retail premises; behind these remained the stone and brick columns over which the yard had been extended when space was at a premium. Much of the land which was not suitable for use either by lock-up traders or for car parking or still in use by British Rail was left derelict. The final traces of the locomotive works vanished with the demolition of the elevated 1930s Southern Railway signal box in the mid-1980s, the signal box having used part of the main locomotive erecting-shop wall as support.|$|E
500|$|Disorganized {{groups of}} prisoners ran in every direction. Ada Lichtman, a {{survivor}} of the escape recalls: [...] "Suddenly we heard shots... Mines started to explode. Riot and confusion prevailed, everything was thundering around. The doors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshop</b> were opened, and everyone rushed through... We ran out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workshop.</b> All around were {{the bodies of the}} dead and wounded." [...] Pechersky was able to successfully escape into the woods. At the end of the uprising, 11 German SS personnel and an unknown number of Ukrainian guards were killed. Out of approximately 550 Jewish prisoners at the Sobibor death camp, 130 chose not to participate in the uprising and remained in the camp; about 80 were killed during the escape either by machine gun fire from watchtowers, or while getting through a mine field in the camp's outer perimeter; 170 more were recaptured by the Nazis during large-scale searches. All who remained in the camp or caught after the escape were executed. 53 Sobibor escapees survived the war. Within days after the uprising, the SS chief Heinrich Himmler ordered the camp closed, dismantled and planted with trees.|$|E
