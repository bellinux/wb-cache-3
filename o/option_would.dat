5|$|Interventions {{to prevent}} a road {{requiring}} reconstruction, the most costly <b>option,</b> <b>would</b> save money.|$|E
5|$|Three {{construction}} {{options were}} evaluated during the project's Environmental Impact Study for {{the portion of}} the line between 11th Street and Hanover Square. One option known as the Shallow Chrystie <b>Option</b> <b>would</b> mainly use cut and cover, while the Deep Chrystie Street and Forsyth Options would use a combination of tunneling by Earth Pressure Balance Machines (EPBMs) and cut and cover. The Shallow Chrystie <b>Option</b> <b>would</b> have used the existing Confucius Plaza tunnel section between Canal and Division Streets, and like the plan from the 1970s, {{there would have been a}} cross-platform transfer to the existing Grand Street station, with the transfer expected to be heavily used. However, this <b>option</b> <b>would</b> require digging up Sara Delano Roosevelt Park to the east as Chrystie Street is not wide enough to fit four tracks. Under this option, a track connection would be built to allow trains from Second Avenue to run via the Manhattan Bridge north tracks to allow service to Brooklyn. The Forsyth <b>Option</b> <b>would</b> curve below the park to Forsyth Street and the station would be built under Forsyth Street, requiring a 200-foot transfer passageway that would be less convenient than the other options. The Deep Chrystie <b>Option</b> <b>would</b> have the Second Avenue Subway run deeper underground, running underneath the existing Grand Street station, with a mezzanine in between the two stations. In order to allow for sufficient room for stairways to transfer to the Second Avenue Line, the Grand Street station would be widened to have twenty foot wide platforms. No track connection would be built under this option, and the Confucius Plaza tunnel section would not be used for subway service, but it instead might be used for ancillary subway facilities. Currently, this is the preferred option.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>option</b> <b>would</b> be to {{implement}} fiscal devaluation, {{based on an}} idea originally developed by John Maynard Keynes in 1931. According to this neo-Keynesian logic, policy makers can increase the competitiveness of an economy by lowering corporate tax burden such as employer's social security contributions, while offsetting the loss of government revenues through higher taxes on consumption (VAT) and pollution, i.e. by pursuing an ecological tax reform.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>options</b> <b>would</b> {{include a}} major {{interchange}} {{in the port}} precinct.|$|R
50|$|All Higher Education <b>options</b> <b>would</b> be {{provided}} by nearby Guildford, Farnham and Farnborough.|$|R
50|$|According to Network Rail, these <b>options</b> <b>would</b> cause massive {{disruption}} to passengers {{for limited}} improvement.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} option, the North Vietnamese could avoid the {{outlying}} South Vietnamese installations and strike directly at their primary target of Ban Me Thuot. For the first option to be successful, the North Vietnamese had to secure Highways 14, 19, and 21 to isolate Ban Me Thuot, and stop potential South Vietnamese reinforcements. The North Vietnamese favoured the first option, {{because it would}} give the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division and other support units little or no time to respond. At the same time, the first <b>option</b> <b>would</b> have enabled a quick victory without inflicting large-scale damage on the civilian population of Ban Me Thuot.|$|E
5|$|Leigh {{appeared}} with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in A Yank at Oxford (1938), {{which was the}} first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends. After dealing with the threat of a lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her <b>option</b> <b>would</b> not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in Sidewalks of London, also known as St. Martin's Lane (1938), with Charles Laughton.|$|E
5|$|The Sedan bridgeheads {{were still}} not safe. French forces were massing to the south. Guderian {{decided it was}} better to mount an {{aggressive}} defence given the lack of any suitable anti-tank weapons for a defensive battle. The better <b>option</b> <b>would</b> be to attack rather than defend. The advance of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions had assisted his progress. They ran into and defeated elements of X Corps near Chemery. The French Corps was heading towards Sedan, but withdrew southward after the engagement. Any potential threat on the German western flank had been removed.|$|E
5000|$|Further plans {{announced}} for certification <b>options</b> <b>would</b> {{include a}} [...] "secured online examination" [...] as {{a less expensive}} alternative to the in-person proctored exams.|$|R
5000|$|Both <b>options</b> <b>would</b> see {{the present}} hourly [...] "all stations" [...] {{stopping}} service between Bletchley and Bedford reduced to {{every two hours}} (apparently conflicting with the stated aim of improving stopping services), but with an additional hourly semi-fast service stopping only at Woburn Sands. Both <b>options</b> <b>would</b> provide two services per hour over the Oxford-Bletchley section: under the Regional <b>option,</b> both services <b>would</b> serve Milton Keynes Central via the West Coast Main Line; under the Local <b>option</b> there <b>would</b> be more stops than the semi-fast Regional Rail service, and one service would continue semi-fast to Bedford instead, with an additional Milton Keynes Central train serving Aylesbury via Bletchley. A further possible hybrid option was identified based on the Regional Rail option, but with the additional hourly train serving Aylesbury working through to Bedford.|$|R

5|$|Fonseca chose both. First, the Brazilian Congress began {{negotiating}} with the mutineers, although this was not Fonseca's preferred solution—he and the Minister of the Navy Marques Leão began plotting a military solution. At the behest of Congress, José Carlos de Carvalho was appointed as a liaison to the rebels. Carvalho, a federal deputy and former naval captain, talked with the crew on all four ships and reported to Congress that the rebels were well led and organized—and their main armament was fully functional. His report showed that the sailor's complaints, especially about the lash, were well-justified and that a military <b>option</b> <b>would</b> be unlikely to succeed. By the afternoon on 23 November, the Brazilian Congress had begun work on {{a bill that would}} grant amnesty to all involved and end the use of corporal punishment in the navy.|$|E
5|$|One way of {{addressing}} carbon leakage {{is to give}} sectors vulnerable to international competition free emission permits (Carbon Trust, 2009). This acts as a subsidy for the sector in question. Free allocation of permits was opposed by the Garnaut Climate Change Review as it considered there were no circumstances that justify it and that governments could deal with market failure or claims for compensation more transparently with the revenue from full auctioning of permits. The economically efficient <b>option</b> <b>would,</b> however, be border adjustments (Neuhoff, 2009; Newbery, 2009). Border adjustments work by setting a tariff on imported goods from less regulated countries. A problem with border adjustments is {{that they might be}} used as a disguise for trade protectionism. Some types of border adjustment may also not prevent emissions leakage.|$|E
5|$|The hostility {{between rival}} Spanish factions in Trujillo continued, and Vasco de Herrera {{was unable to}} unite the colonists behind him. He decided the best <b>option</b> <b>would</b> be to found a new town, and {{possibly}} abandon Trujillo. Cerezeda opposed him at every turn, believing this {{would lead to the}} ruin of the Spanish enterprise in Honduras. Natives working the mines near Trujillo rebelled against their excessive tax burden, killing several Spaniards. Vasco de Herrera seized this opportunity as an excuse to launch a punitive expedition, but instead marched inland in an attempt to found another colony. The Nahuas of Papayeca rebelled against the excessive cruelty of Andrés de Cereceda under their leader Picecura, and fled to the wilds. In 1531, Vasco de Herrera attempted to bring them back to their settlements.|$|E

5000|$|The {{project is}} still in the {{planning}} stages and there are several options under discussion. The Austevoll option is considered the most useful possibility, but it is the most expensive as it requires two long and deep tunnels. Other <b>options</b> <b>would</b> route the road through Tysnes municipality (with ferry) or Fusa (a long bridge, a detour, no ferry). Other <b>options</b> <b>would</b> build bridges over the Bjørnafjorden or Fusafjorden. The project is not finalised, but it is hoped construction will commence around 2018. The project may cost about [...]|$|R

5|$|The {{line would}} cost $1billion, if build in its full length with a {{connection}} to the IND Queens Boulevard Line, and would stretch across , providing connections to several subway services as well as the LIRR. Another possible <b>option</b> <b>would</b> have Long Island Rail Road service restored with service to seven stations along the right-of-way, with service ending in Howard Beach. The line would serve upwards of 250,000 passengers per day and would provide access to JFK Airport from Midtown Manhattan. In February 2015, the Regional Plan Association suggested having some F trains, after running through the 63rd Street Tunnel, be rerouted to operate over the Lower Montauk Branch of the LIRR running through underserved Maspeth and Glendale and then meeting up with the Rockaway Beach Branch in Rego Park.|$|E
5|$|Extending {{the line}} through the Sunnyside Yard and onto the LIRR Montauk Branch, running {{directly}} to the lower level of the Archer Avenue Line in Jamaica. The Montauk Branch in Queens is currently used for freight service, last seeing passenger service in 1998, {{and would have been}} rebuilt and electrified. The Montauk line would merge with the BMT Jamaica elevated at Lefferts Boulevard just west of 121st Street, using the BMT approach to the Archer Avenue subway. The Jamaica El would truncated to Crescent Street in Brooklyn and replaced by bus service. New stations would be built at Thomson Avenue within the Sunnyside Yard, and at Fresh Pond Road (the site of the former Fresh Pond station) and Woodhaven Boulevard (at the former Ridgewood station site) along the Montauk Branch. The now-closed Richmond Hill station on the Montauk Branch would be renovated and lengthened for subway service. The LIRR would have exclusive use of the tracks during overnight hours for freight service. This $594 million <b>option</b> <b>would</b> be open by 1997, but people living around the Montauk Branch opposed the proposal due to fears of increased traffic and danger from the Montauk Branch's multiple grade crossings, though plans called for new overpasses and access roads to eliminate these crossings.|$|E
25|$|After using longer {{trains and}} running trains at 75 second headways, the next <b>option</b> <b>would</b> be to {{lengthen}} the station platforms to accommodate longer trains. This expansion <b>option</b> <b>would</b> {{be the most}} expensive as it would require heavy construction at all Expo Line stations.|$|E
50|$|The Gateway Corridor Commission {{has dropped}} the {{commuter}} rail option, leaving only possible {{bus rapid transit}} or light rail routes. All of the bus rapid transit route <b>options</b> <b>would</b> run on Interstate 94.|$|R

25|$|The Draft Environmental Impact Study (DEIS) for {{the project}} was issued in June 2017. Four {{alternatives}} for alignments under the Hudson River and the Palisades. Option 1 would have the new tunnels run close to the existing tunnels with a ventilation site near the Lincoln Tunnel Helix. This <b>option</b> <b>would</b> have required a construction staging site within the Lincoln Tunnel Helix, thus displacing New Jersey Transit's Weehawken bus storage site, which would {{have a negative impact}} on the operation of buses to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Option 2 would have the new tunnels run further south than the first option, with a shaft site north of 19th Street near JFK Boulevard East. This <b>option</b> <b>would</b> require the acquisition and demolition of an existing multi-story office building to build the shaft site. The third <b>option</b> <b>would</b> be further south with a shaft site south of 19th Street. This <b>option</b> <b>would</b> preclude the development of a portion of a planned residential development under construction at 800 Harbor Boulevard. The fourth <b>option</b> <b>would</b> be further south with a shaft site south of 18th Street–following the same horizontal alignment identified in the ARC FEIS. Alignment Option 4 was chosen for the build alternative even though it would have a slightly longer tunnel than in the other alternatives. Because of the additional length, there would be additional tunneling costs for this option. However, the first three options have greater pre-construction risks, meaning that if construction was delayed the cost difference would be minimized. In addition, Option 4 does not have the issues that the first three options have.|$|E
25|$|The Water Street {{option was}} chosen {{even though it}} would cost $360 million more because of the {{additional}} benefits it would provide. The Nassau Street <b>option</b> <b>would</b> have required the reorganization of the existing services on the Nassau Street Line, and passengers entering via the Williamsburg Bridge would not have direct service to destinations {{in other parts of}} Brooklyn. Additionally, over a period between two and three years long, service on the Nassau Street Line would have been required to be shut down during late nights and/or weekend hours. The Nassau Street <b>option</b> <b>would</b> not have the capacity for future Queens service via the 63rd Street Tunnel.|$|E

25|$|In the {{preliminary}} {{planning for the}} new line between Ebensfeld and Erfurt, a total of seven different options were examined. Three different options were introduced into the route selection process for the Coburg and southern Thuringia areas. In February 1992, Deutsche Bundesbahn presented three options: one running from the existing section north of Lichtenfels, via Rödental and Stadtilm to Erfurt. The second <b>option</b> <b>would</b> have branched off north of Staffelstein, parallel to the planned Autobahn through Coburg and {{would have taken a}} route via Großbreitenbach and Stadtilm to Erfurt. The third <b>option</b> <b>would</b> have branched from a junction north of Ebensfeld and run via Coburg, Eisfeld, Großbreitenbach and Arnstadt to connect with the existing Eisenach–Erfurt line at Möbisburg.|$|E
25|$|Bolivians began campaigning {{against the}} Chilean option, arguing instead that the {{pipeline}} should be routed north through the Peruvian port of Ilo, 260km {{further from the}} gas fields than Mejillones, or, better yet, first industrialized in Bolivia. According to Chilean estimates, the Mejillones <b>option</b> <b>would</b> be $600 million cheaper.|$|E
25|$|A model {{similar to}} one {{proposed}} by the late Senator Ted Kennedy would bring in between 21.5 million and 67.5 million according to the group. A 2008 report by the Urban Institute stated the public <b>option</b> <b>would</b> probably settle into a 'niche' in the insurance market with other firms still able to compete.|$|E
50|$|On 9 February 2006 President Stephen Jennings {{announced}} that the offer would be rejected, giving administration time to evaluate and change the way that WUEV has been managed on campus.
