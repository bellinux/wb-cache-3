[...] Mrs. Bunker flushed and paled at the thought. She could see him! The letter would be sufficient excuse, the distrust suggested by her husband would give color to her delivering it in person. There was perhaps a brief twinge of conscience in taking this advantage of Zephas' kindness, but the next moment, with that peculiar logic known only to the sex, she made the unfortunate man's suggestion a condonation of her deceit. SHE hadn't asked to go; HE had offered to take her. He had only himself to thank.|$|E
6000|$|Whether or not Mrs. McGee DID follow him, she {{exhibited}} neither concern, solicitude, nor {{the least}} embarrassment. An experienced lover might have augured ill from this total absence of self-consciousness. But Madison {{was not an}} experienced lover. He accepted her amused smile as a recognition of his feelings, trembled {{at the touch of}} her cool hands, {{as if it had been}} a warm pressure, and scarcely dared to meet her maliciously laughing eyes. When he had followed Mr. McGee to the little gallery, the previous occupation of Mrs. McGee when they arrived was explained. From that slight elevation there was a perfect view over the whole landscape and river below; the Bar stretched out as a map at her feet; in that clear, transparent air she could see every movement and gesture of Wayne's brother, all unconscious of that surveillance, at work on the Bar. For an instant Madison's sallow cheek reddened, he knew not why; a remorseful feeling that he ought to be there with Arthur came over him. Mrs. McGee's voice seemed to answer his thought. [...] "You can see everything that's going <b>on</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> without being seen yourself. It's good fun for me sometimes.

6000|$|At {{this the}} Spirit, with a sigh, lets his eyes travel {{on to the}} city walls, and now he dwells on the change there with wonder at these modern times. Why have five out of the eleven {{convenient}} gates been closed? And why, above all, should the towers have been levelled that were once a glory and defence? Is the world become so peaceful, then, and do Florentines dwell in such harmony, {{that there are no}} longer conspiracies to bring ambitious exiles home again with armed bands at their back? These are difficult questions: it is easier and pleasanter to recognise the old than to account for the new. And there flows Arno, with its bridges just where they used to be--the Ponte Vecchio, least like other bridges in the world, laden with the same quaint shops where our Spirit remembers lingering a little on his way perhaps to look at the progress of that great palace which Messer Luca Pitti had set a-building with huge stones got from the Hill of Bogoli [now Boboli] close behind, or perhaps to transact a little business with the cloth-dressers in Oltrarno. The exorbitant line of the Pitti roof is hidden from San Miniato; but the yearning of the old Florentine is not to see Messer Luca's too ambitious palace which he built unto himself; it is to be down among those narrow streets and busy humming Piazze where he inherited the eager life of his fathers. Is not the anxious voting with black and white beans still going <b>on</b> <b>down</b> <b>there?</b> Who are the Priori in these months, eating soberly--regulated official dinners in the Palazzo Vecchio, with removes of tripe and boiled partridges, seasoned by practical jokes against the ill-fated butt among those potent signors? Are not the significant banners still hung from the windows--still distributed with decent pomp under Orcagna's Loggia every two months? ...|$|E

6000|$|As Scott said to Terry, [...] "If a {{man will}} paint from nature, {{he will be}} likely to amuse those who are daily looking at it." [...] The years which saw the first {{appearance}} of [...] "Guy Mannering" [...] also witnessed that of [...] "Emma." [...] By the singular chance, or law, which links great authors closely in time, giving us novelists in pairs, Miss Austen was [...] "drawing from nature" [...] {{at the very moment}} when Scott was wedding nature with romance. How generously and wisely he admired her is familiar, and it may, to some, seem curious that he never deliberately set himself to a picture of ordinary life, free from the intrusion of the unusual, of the heroic. Once, looking down at the village which lies on the Tweed, opposite Melrose, he remarked that under its roofs tragedies and tales were doubtless being lived. 'I undertake to say there is some real romance at this moment going <b>on</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> that, if it could have justice done to it, would be well worth all the fiction that was ever spun out of human brains.' But the example he gave was terrible,--"anything more dreadful was never conceived by Crabbe;" [...] yet, adds Lockhart, [...] "it would never have entered into his head to elaborate such a tale." [...] He could not dwell in the unbroken gloom dear to some modern malingerers. But he could easily have made a tale of common Scotch life, dark with the sorrow of Mucklebackit, and bright with the mirth of Cuddie Headrigg. There was, however, this difficulty,--that Scott cared not to write a story of a single class. [...] "From the peer to the ploughman," [...] all society mingles in each of his novels. A fiction of middle-class life did not allure him, and he was not at the best, but at his worst, as Sydney Smith observed, in the light talk of society. He could admire Miss Austen, and read her novels again and again; but had he attempted to follow her, by way of variety, then inevitably wild as well as disciplined humour would have kept breaking in, and his fancy would have wandered like the old knights of Arthur's Court, [...] "at adventure." [...] "St. Ronan's Well" [...] proved the truth of all this. Thus it happens that, in [...] "The Antiquary," [...] with all his sympathy for the people, with all his knowledge of them, he does not confine himself to their cottages. As Lockhart says, in his admirable piece of criticism, he preferred to choose topics in which he could display [...] "his highest art, that of skilful contrast." ...|$|E

50|$|George Armitage {{had made}} a few films for Roger Corman, acting in Von Richtofen and Brown and writing and acting in Gas-s-s-s. He wanted to direct. Armitage:Peter Bogdanovich and Francis Coppola had left working with Roger, so there was an opening there for directors, I asked him if I could direct, and he said sure. He said: “Would {{you like to do}} a nurse movie or a {{stewardess}} move?” I said I’d like to do a stewardess movie, and he said: “Okay, well then you can do the nurse movie.” Okay! Anyways, I got into it, and I wrote the script, and I got Everett Chambers, from Peyton Place, a crew of some TV guys that I’d worked with, and some young commercial crew. This fellow called Fouad Said had invented this thing called Cinemobile... and I used it to film on location. I did everything on location... I shot the whole movie in the South Bay, Manhattan Beach—it’s exactly the same place and time period that Paul Thomas Anderson used in Inherent Vice.Armitage said the film had to feature sex but he put in a let-down sex scene at the beginning.I was talking to the girls and they said: “Hey, why don’t you do a guy who’s just a lousy lay. Sometimes you run into that.” And I thought that’d be perfect for the South Bay, because it was a pretty crazy culture going <b>on</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> at the time, so that’s what we did.Armitage heard about the band Sky, went to see them perform at a high school, and cast them in the film.|$|E
