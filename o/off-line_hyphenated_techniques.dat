40|$|Traditional {{analytical}} approaches including HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatograph), GC (Gas Chromatograph), UV (Ultraviolet) detection, etc., {{have become}} insufficient to effectively handle {{the growing number}} of challenges in analyses of species- specificity and sensitivity. Modern analytical technique referred to as <b>hyphenated</b> <b>techniques,</b> originate from the traditional use of molecule or element specific detection in electrophoresis or chromatography. Currently the most common techniques for trace element speciation include a combination of separation technique coupled with a detection technique that is more sensitive. Earlier such <b>hyphenated</b> <b>techniques</b> were the coupling of separation of a special sample preparation off-line and later adding a detection <b>technique.</b> Presently, the <b>hyphenated</b> <b>technique</b> is developed from the coupling of a separation technique (Chromatography) and an on-line spectroscopic detection technology. <b>Hyphenated</b> <b>techniques</b> combine chromatographic and spectral methods to exploit the advantages of both. Chromatography produces pure or nearly pure fractions of chemical components in a mixture. Spectroscopy produces selective information for identification using standards or library spectra. These <b>hyphenated</b> <b>techniques</b> offer shorter analysis time, higher degree of automation, higher sample throughput, better reproducibility, reduction of contamination because it is a closed system, Enhanced combined selectivity and therefore higher degree of information. The remarkable improvements in hyphenated analytical methods {{over the last two decades}} have significantly broadened their applications in the analysis of biomaterials, especially natural products. In this article, recent advances in the applications of various <b>hyphenated</b> <b>techniques,</b> e. g., GC-MS, LC-MS, LC-FTIR, LC-NMR, CE-MS, etc. in the context of pre-isolation analyses of crude extracts or fraction from various natural sources, isolation and on-line detection of natural products, chemotaxonomic studies, chemical fingerprinting, quality control of herbal products, dereplication of natural products, and metabolomic studies are discussed with appropriate examples...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that metals and {{metalloids}} have a strong impact on the environment, the methods of their determination and speciation have received special attention in recent years. Arsenic, antimony, and thallium are important examples of such toxic elements. Their speciation is especially important in the environmental and biomedical fields because of their toxicity, bioavailability, and reactivity. Recently, speciation analytics has been playing a unique role in the studies of biogeochemical cycles of chemical compounds, determination of toxicity and ecotoxicity of selected elements, quality control of food products, control of medicines and pharmaceutical products, technological process control, research on the impact of technological installation on the environment, examination of occupational exposure, and clinical analysis.

40|$|A review with 22 refs. Higher plants {{represent}} {{a rich source}} of new mols. with pharmacol. properties, which are lead compds. for the development of new drugs. During the last decades, the renewed interest in investigating natural products has led to the advent of several important drugs, such as the anticancer substances vinblastine, vincristine and taxol, or the antimalarial agent artemisinin. Success in natural products research is conditioned by a careful plant selection, based on various criteria such as chemotaxonomic data, information from traditional medicine, field observations or even random collection. One main strategy in the isolation of new leads consists of the so-called bioactivity-guided isolation, in which pharmacol. or biol. assays are used to target the isolation of bioactive compds. One major drawback of this strategy is the frequent isolation of known metabolites. Therefore, <b>hyphenated</b> <b>techniques</b> (LC-UV/DAD, LC-MS, LC-NMR) have been developed, in order to detect as early as possible potential original structures. These compds. can then be tested in various bioassays.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{discover}} new bioactive compounds from plant sources which could become new leads or new drugs, extracts should be submitted {{at the same}} time to chemical screening and to various biological or pharmacological targets. Metabolite profiling using <b>hyphenated</b> <b>techniques</b> such as LC/UV, LC/MS and more recently LC/NMR, quickly provides plenty of structural information, leading to a partial or a complete on-line de novo structure determination of the natural products of interest. As a complement to this approach, bioassays performed after LC/microfractionation of the extracts allow efficient localisation of the bioactive LC-peaks in the chromatograms. The combination of metabolite profiling and LC/bioassays provides the possibility of distinguishing between already known bioactive compounds (dereplication) and new molecules directly in crude plant extracts. Thus, the tedious isolation of compounds of low interest can be avoided and targeted isolation of new bioactive products or constituents presenting novel or unusual spectroscopic features can be undertaken. Several examples of rapid localisation of bioactive compounds, based on post-chromatographic bioautographic testing of LC/NMR microfractions and subsequent on-line identification will be illustrated. Application of <b>hyphenated</b> <b>techniques</b> for the efficient characterisation of labile constituents or constituents difficult to separate at the preparative scale will also be mentioned.
