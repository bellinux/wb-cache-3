2500|$|Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc. (2000) is {{a further}} example of this {{temporary}} trend in which plaintiffs {{did not have to}} demonstrate any real interference. [...] Register.com, a domain name registry service, sued competitor Verio for using Register.com's proprietary WHOIS look-up service to find potential leads among its customer base. The court found that, by continuing to access Register.com's <b>online</b> <b>customer</b> database after being told to stop, Verio was trespassing on Register.com's WHOIS server. Register.com had specifically withdrawn its consent to Verio's use of search robots to review Register.com's customer list. The court held that Verio caused harm to Register.com's files through the use of these search robots and that the searches improperly taxed Register.com's server capacity.|$|E

30|$|Savelsbergh and Van Woensel [44] {{discuss the}} case of Walmart which {{contemplate}} the involvement of its in-store customers (occasional drivers) to deliver items that <b>online</b> <b>customers</b> order. It aims at guaranteeing same-day delivery to <b>online</b> <b>customers</b> and uses company drivers only in addition to perform occasional unforeseen deliveries. From a city logistics perspective, offering such a service {{is likely to increase}} the number of freight movements further, making coordination and consolidation of direct-to-consumer deliveries even more challenging. Furthermore, Mak [26] studies a novel crowdshipping service strategy foreseeing the use of in-store customers to deliver orders to <b>online</b> <b>customers,</b> looking at its potential impact on retailers’ operational and marketing strategies.

40|$|A fully {{connected}} Internet business environment will introduce {{a high level}} of dynamics to the business process. It may result in very frequent changes in business decision, and thus, information of various items may undergo constant changes. In addition, there could be a flood of similar shopping sites. In such a highly dynamic environment, ordinary <b>online</b> <b>customers</b> may feel that online shopping is not comfortable. Existing service models or systems cannot effectively reflect such a dynamic environment and support ordinary <b>online</b> <b>customers.</b> We propose a new E-commerce service called the CIGMA. The CIGMA provides catalog comparison and purchase mediation services over multiple shopping sites for ordinary <b>online</b> <b>customers.</b> The service is based on up-to-date information by reflecting the frequent changes in catalog information in real-time. It also matches the desire of the <b>online</b> <b>customers</b> for fast response since the service is provided based on the data cached in a high performance caching system. An important and challenging issue in realizing the CIGMA service is the design of merchant-side interface. This paper presents the CIGMA along with its merchant-side interface including service setup and deployment procedure. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study is to propose a framework of intention to continuously adopt online financial services.

The research findings showed that: 1. website trust influences on the intention to continuous adoption of online financial services; 2. cognitive trust of <b>online</b> <b>customers</b> influences on affective trust; 3. factors of transaction security, website and company awareness, prior Internet experience, and navigation functions directly influence on cognitive trust of <b>online</b> <b>customers,</b> and; 4. transaction security is the only factor that influences on affective trust of <b>online</b> <b>customers.</b> This research provides a theoretical foundation for academics and also practical guidelines for service providers in dealing with the trust aspects of online financial service. </p...|$|R
