40|$|In an uncontrolled, open trial, 182 outpatients {{suffering}} from either <b>overuse</b> <b>syndromes</b> (n = 68) or minor traumas (n = 114) resulting from soccer practice received proglumetacin, a prodrug of indomethacin, for 10 days, at {{a dose of}} 600 mg/d from day 1 to day 5 and 450 mg/d from day 6 to day 10. After 2 days and at 5 and 10 days, a highly significant reduction in symptoms (pain, edema, redness, and local heat) and improvement of function were observed (P < 0. 001). The incidence of side effects (11. 5 %) - mainly gastrointestinal (9. 3 %) - was low, especially compared with that usually described for indomethacin. More than 50 % of the patients who developed side effects were able to continue taking proglumetacin without any specific treatment for the adverse reactions. Seven patients (ie, 3. 8 % of all patients in the study) had to discontinue the treatment. For the treatment of sport injuries (both <b>overuse</b> <b>syndromes</b> and minor traumas) due to soccer practice, proglumetacin {{appears to be a}} safe, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory compound that is associated with a reduction in pain, edema, redness, and local heat, and improvement in function in treated patients.

We used PNF muscle strengthening exercises to help the patient regain continence, while taking care to prevent <b>overuse</b> <b>syndrome.</b> This therapy was performed in 7 stages and we assessed the results in each stage.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} ways in which embodiedness has become {{problematic}} for New Zealand sufferers of occupational <b>overuse</b> <b>syndrome</b> (OOS). While successful rehabilitation could lead back to employment, this was based on the biographical continuity of a bodily hexus that ignored persistent pain. The reality of OOS involved a liminal fragility associated with social isolation, loss of identities, pain and functional disability that was incorporated into re-negotiated identities and biographies with the result that respondents became exquisitely self-absorbed, exercising constant bodily surveillance and discipline in order to manage their symptoms. Keywords chronic illness and disability, experiencing illness and narratives, narrative analysis Occupational <b>overuse</b> <b>syndrome</b> (OOS) enjoyed a brief period of media and medical notoriety that peaked between the mid- 1980 s and mid- 1990 s in Australia and New Zealand. Several reasons have been put forward to explain why interest in OOS waned during the late 1990 s; these include increasing medical scepticism; improvements in workplace ergonomics; improvements in workplace relationships; and limiting access to compensation (Hall and Morrow, 1988; McEachen, 2005). The apparent resolution of OOS as a workplace problem may also explain the relative dearth of sociological and anthropological attention to the personal and social consequences of OOS. However, despite decreasing epidemiological incidence, injury compensation data suggest that many New Zealand workers are still affected by chronic OOS injuries that prevent their return to full participation in the workforce...|$|E

40|$|In {{comparison}} to other mammals, humans are not especially strong, swift or supple. Nevertheless, despite these apparent physical limitations, we are among Natures most superbly well-adapted endurance runners. Paradoxically, however, notwithstanding this evolutionary-bestowed proficiency, running-related injuries, and <b>Overuse</b> <b>syndromes</b> in particular, are widely pervasive. The term ‘coordination’ is similarly ubiquitous within contemporary coaching, conditioning and rehabilitation cultures. Various theoretical models of coordination exist within the academic literature. However the specific neural and biological underpinnings of ‘running coordination’, {{and the nature}} of their integration, remain poorly elaborated. Conventionally running is considered a mundane, readily mastered coordination skill. This illusion of coordinative simplicity, however, is founded upon a platform of immense neural and biological complexities. This extensive complexity presents extreme organizational difficulties yet, simultaneously, provides a multiplicity of viable pathways through which the computational and mechanical burden of running can be proficiently dispersed amongst expanded networks of conditioned neural and peripheral tissue collaborators. Learning to adequately harness this available complexity, however, is a painstakingly slowly emerging, practice-driven process, greatly facilitated by innate evolutionary organizing principles serving to constrain otherwise overwhelming complexity to manageable proportions. As we accumulate running experiences persistent plastic remodeling customizes networked neural connectivity and biological tissue properties to best fit our unique neural and architectural idiosyncrasies, and personal histories: thus neural and peripheral tissue plasticity embeds coordination habits. When, however, coordinative processes are compromised —under the integrated influence of fatigue and/or accumulative cycles of injury, overuse, misuse and disuse— this spectrum of available ‘choice’ dysfunctionally contracts, and our capacity to safely disperse the mechanical ‘stress’ of running progressively diminishes. Now the running work burden falls increasingly on reduced populations of collaborating components. Accordingly our capacity to effectively manage, dissipate and accommodate running-imposed stress diminishes, and vulnerability to <b>Overuse</b> <b>syndromes</b> escalates. Awareness of the deep underpinnings of running coordination enhances conceptual clarity, thereby informing training and rehabilitation insights designed to offset the legacy of excessive or progressively accumulating exposure to running-imposed mechanical stress...|$|R

The lower leg, {{foot and}} ankle form a functional {{unit of the}} locomotor system with an important static and dynamic function. Injury or loss of function of any muscle group of the lower leg and the foot influences normal gait or impedes standing. Increased or frequent loads on the muscle group may lead to pain <b>syndromes</b> known as <b>overuse</b> <b>syndromes</b> or <b>overuse</b> injuries. Athletes and certain professions involving standing or walking {{for a long time}} are especially susceptible to increased muscle strains. This article describes and clarifies the causes and the development of the pain syndromes in the lower leg, foot and ankle associated with certain professions or sports. The description of anatomical relationships and functions of individual muscle groups is here to clarify the occurrence of overuse injuries which may involve the muscle itself, the tendon, or the point of their attachment to the bone. The article describes observations and experiences from everyday clinical practice, but it also summarises results described in recent publications. The focus is also put on the therapy, which is usually conservative. Particular mention is given to new non-invasive surgical techniques.

In order to make the approach easier, three age groups can and should be considered.

Prevention involves education of staff and students about the overuse process, rationalisation of practice habits and repertoire, abolition or reduction of static loading of the weight of the instruments, and earlier reporting when the problem is most easily corrected.

30|$|Most {{theories}} consider overloading {{to be the}} aetiology for inguinal pathologies.

Furthermore, the <b>overuse</b> <b>syndrome</b> resulting from this biomechanical stress may cause the disruption of the insertion of the rectus abdominis muscle at the symphysis level [68, 77].
