Moreover, efficiency can further be realized as functional organizations integrate their activities vertically so that products are sold and distributed quickly and at low cost.

25|$|Platforms like LinkedIn {{create an}} {{environment}} for companies and clients to connect online. Companies that {{recognize the need for}} information, originality/ and accessibility employ blogs to make their products popular and unique/ and ultimately reach out to consumers who are privy to social media. Studies from 2009 show that consumers view coverage in the media or from bloggers as being more neutral and credible than print advertisements, which are not thought of as free or independent. Blogs allow a product or company to provide longer descriptions <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> services, can include testimonials and can link to and from other social network and blog pages. Blogs can be updated frequently and are promotional techniques for keeping customers, and also for acquiring followers and subscribers who can then be directed to social network pages. Online communities can enable a business to reach the clients of other businesses using the platform. To allow firms to measure their standing in the corporate world, sites enable employees to place evaluations of their companies.|$|E

2500|$|Such {{organizations}} seldom involve sales <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> {{services with}} value. Without creating any goods or services, the only revenue streams for the scheme are recruiting more members or soliciting {{more money from}} current members. The behavior of pyramid schemes follows the mathematics concerning exponential growth quite closely. Each level of the pyramid is {{much larger than the}} one before it. For a pyramid scheme to make money for everyone who enrolls in it, it would have to expand indefinitely. [...] This is not possible because the population of Earth is finite. When the scheme inevitably runs out of new recruits, lacking other sources of revenue, it collapses. Because in a geometric series, the biggest terms are at the end, most people will be in the lower levels of the pyramid (and indeed the bottom level is always the biggest single layer).|$|E
40|$|The classic {{definition}} of quality is “the ability <b>of</b> a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service to consistently meet or exceed a customer’s expectations. ” An {{important element of}} the definition, customer’s expectations, requires further defining since cus-tomers value certain aspects <b>of</b> a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service and they therefore associate those aspects with its quality. <b>Product</b> <b>or</b> service quality has many facets. Quality might include the following elements: • Performance or the main characteristic <b>of</b> the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service. • Aesthetics, which include the “look and feel ” <b>of</b> the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service. • Special features <b>of</b> the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service. • Conformance or how well the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service aligns with the customer’s expectations. • Safety, which includes the element of risk of injury or harm. • Reliability {{or the ability to}} consistently deliver the intended results. • Durability or the useful life of the prod-uct or service. • Reputation <b>of</b> the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service. Different customers will have differ-ent expectations <b>of</b> a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service based on the relative value they place on these components at a given moment in time. To make a determination of the quality of an educational program, one must identify the customers and their expectations of the program as they relate to the facets they deem most important. This is particularly true when a program, such as technology education, purports a significant change in it focus, content, and importance. In essence, the perceived quality of the new program will be influ-enced by the reputation of the program it has replaced, its academic home, and the faculty associated with the program...|$|R
