40|$|Oats {{are unique}} among the cereals {{due to its}} high content of mixed-linked (1 - 3),(1 - 4) ß-D-glucan (ß-glucan), a highly viscous dietary fibre {{component}} which may have several physiological effects. The aims of the thesis were to study the glycemic response and gastric emptying rate of an <b>oat</b> fibre test <b>meal</b> in diabetic subjects, to elucidate the mechanisms behind the serum cholesterol lowering effects of oat fibre, and to study the small bowel excretion of energy supplying nutrients as well as iron absorption from diets with oat bran, barley fibre and wheat bread. The specific effect of oat bran ß-glucan was studied by comparing the physiological effects of oat bran bread with added ß-glucanase {{with the effects of}} normal oat bran bread. Controlled diets were served in two-day periods to ileostomy subjects or as test meals with postprandial blood sampling. Ileostomy effluent was frequently sampled and immediately frozen. Radioisotope-technique was used for measurement of gastric emptying rate and of cholesterol and iron absorption. A portion of oat bran porridge (4 g ß-glucan) did not influence glycemic and insulinemic responses or gastric emptying rate compared to a low-fibre control meal in NIDDM subjects. Oat bran ß-glucan (8. 7 g/d) increased 24 -h bile acid excretion by 83 %, and by 93 % after the <b>oat</b> bran test <b>meal</b> (6 g ß-glucan), high in fat and cholesterol. Cholesterol absorption was unchanged while the excretion of endogenous cholesterol decreased after the <b>oat</b> fibre test <b>meal.</b> The changes in serum lathosterol concentration, reflecting cholesterol synthesis, correlated with changes in sterol excretion. Fat excretion increased and {{there seemed to be a}} delay in the lipid solubilization process observed as a reduced increase in serum chylomicron lipids. The oat ß-glucan did not influence small bowel nutrient excretion. Less than 50 % of the energy excreted with the oat and barley diets was supplied by the fibre per se. Iron absorption was lower from the oat bran diets compared to a low-fibre, low-phytate wheat diet. The iron absorption was related to the phytate content of the oat, barley and wheat diets independent of the amount of ß-glucan. In conclusion, the main physiological effect of oat fibre is an increase in bile acid excretion mediated by the ß-glucan. This induces several changes in cholesterol metabolism which most probably explains the cholesterol lowering effect of oat fibre. Oat fibre does not seem to decrease nutrient absorption from the small intestine but may delay the lipid absorption process...|$|R

Aim of the study: To evaluate {{the impact of}} fermented whole grain cereal kernels with high content of amylose (40 %) and/or β-glucan (4. 6 %) on postprandial glucose and insulin responses in healthy adults. Methods: Thirteen healthy volunteers (4 men and 9 women) were given 25 g available carbohydrate portions of: glucose solution; tempe fermented whole-grain barley and tempe fermented whole-grain oat. Blood samples were collected directly before the meal (fasting) and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min {{after the start of}} the meal. The GI (glycemic index) and II (insulin index) of meals were calculated for each subject according to FAO/WHO standards. Results: Peak glucose response was lowest after the tempe meal with high-amylose/ high-ß-glucan barley tempe while insulin response was lowest after the meal with high β-glucan oat tempe. The mean blood glucose responses for both the barley and the <b>oat</b> tempe <b>meals</b> were significantly lower than from the reference glucose load (P < 0. 0001) during the first 60 min.

These people subjected this <b>oat</b> or wheat <b>meal</b> to prolonged cooking, it being a historical fact that the porridge pot was always on the stove. It constituted their main article of food and with milk it formed a balanced dietary. When some of these people immigrated to this country, they introduced their food here.

For the implementation of these maximum levels more data on occurrence and behaviour of T- 2 - and HT- 2 -toxins in primary agricultural products as well as during cleaning treatment and food processing are needed. In the current work we determined the T- 2 /HT- 2 concentrations in four oat cultivars (Aragon, Dominik, Ivory, Pergamon) from 10 different agricultural sites in Germany, grown in cultivar studies in 2007. The grains were de-hulled, <b>oat</b> <b>meal</b> was prepared and bread with 20 % <b>oat</b> <b>meal</b> and 80 % wheat flour was baked. In the cereal processing chain, samples were taken at various steps and subsequently analysed for their T- 2 /HT- 2 content. We employed a chromatographic system with a mass spectrometer as the detector (LC-MS) and an immunological screening method (ELISA) for T- 2 /HT- 2 determination. Detection limits were between one and 10 µg kg- 1 in different matrices. T- 2 /HT- 2 concentrations analysed with ELISA in the available oat samples from ten different agricultural sites in Germany were between 9 and 623 µg kg- 1.

40|$|This thesis {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} the tempe fermentation {{process as a}} means to develop nutritionally improved vegetarian products from barley and oats. The work was designed to assess relationships between selection of raw material and processing conditions in correlation to nutrient content and availability. Whole grains of high amylose/high ß-glucan barley and high ß-glucan oats were tempe fermented with Rhizopus oligosporus, in order to: reduce phytate content to increase iron absorption, obtain low glycemic responses, and increase formation and accessibility of folates. The barley and oat tempe were evaluated in human studies. Corresponding meals were also in vitro digested in order to evaluate the potential of estimating human nutrient bioavailability in a computer controlled gastrointestinal model. Pearling, soaking and returning of pearling fractions before tempe fermentation was found to degrade the phytate content by 97 % and to increase human iron absorption from 3. 0 % to 5. 5 %. In vitro digestion of similar meals showed an increase in iron availability from 1. 7 % to 4. 9 %, indicating that the tendency of the iron absorption could be predicted. The glucose response was lower from the barley tempe while the insulin response was lowest after intake of oat tempe. The calculated glycemic and insulinemic indices (GI and II) were 30 and 55 from barley tempe and 63 and 21 from oat tempe, respectively. In vitro starch digestion rate of barley and <b>oat</b> tempe <b>meals</b> were consistent with the human glycemic response, and by combining the determination of in vitro starch hydrolysis with microscopy studies of starch granules, a possible correlation between structural changes during digestion and the rate of starch hydrolysis was observed. Furthermore, tempe fermentation of barley increased folate content by 2. 5 times, and the in vitro folate accessibility was 46 - 86 % in boiled barley tempe. This work shows the nutritional potential of tempe fermented whole-grain cereal products with a range of health benefits, such aslow glycemic responses and high availability of iron and folate.

Feeds, feces, and digesta were analyzed for DM, inorganic matter, CP, ether extract, and crude fiber. Dietary NDO did not significantly affect apparent fecal and small intestinal digestion of nutrients in growing pigs. After being fed a NDO-free diet through d 10 after weaning, 38 -d-old weanling pigs (n = 20), averaging 10. 4 /-. 8 kg on d 0 of the experiment, were fed a control diet (based on cornstarch, casein, and <b>oat</b> husk <b>meal)</b> or the control with 10 or 40 g of FOS or TOS/kg (four pigs per diet). Feces and urine were collected on d 13 to 17, and ileal digesta were collected via a postvalve T-cecum cannula on d 33 to 37 of the experiment. Feeds, feces, and digesta were analyzed for DM, inorganic matter, CP, ether extract, starch, NDF, ADF, ADL, Ca, P, Mg, Fe, Cu, and Zn. Nonstarch neutral-detergent soluble carbohydrates (NNSC) completed the mass balance for the carbohydrates. Urine was analyzed for N and minerals. The apparent fecal digestion of NNSC increased in the NDO-supplemented diets. The TOS-fed pigs tended (P<. 10) to have a higher apparent fecal digestion of CP than the FOS-fed and control pigs but excreted more N via the urine (P<. 01). Nitrogen and mineral balances were not affected. The FOS was nearly completely degraded prececally. Mean fiber digestion was lower at the fecal compared with the ileal level, as was the extent of NDO effects. This indicates that fiber digestion requires more than 2 wk to adapt to dietary NDO. Apparent ileal digestion of hemicellulose increased for the NDO-supplemented diets (P<. 05), but that of NNSC decreased (P<. 001). Thus, under the well-controlled conditions of this experiment, dietary NDO hardly affected nutrient digestion in well-kept growing and weanling pigs. However, digestion of dietary nonstarch carbohydrates may be affected...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The study {{aimed to}} assess the nutritive value in vitro of 4 feeds (grains and forages) {{commonly}} used in horses nutrition in Mexico, in the absence or presence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 4 mg/g DM. Fecal inoculum was obtained from 4 adult English Thoroughbred horses fed on restricted amount of concentrate and oat hay ad libitum. The incubated substrates included were corn gluten <b>meal,</b> soybean <b>meal,</b> <b>oat</b> grain and alfalfa hay. Gas production was recorded at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 24, 48 and 70 h using the Pressure Transducer Technique. Some ingredient × yeast interactions were observed (P <. 020) for the asymptotic gas production (GP) and GP at 48 and 70 h of incubation. Yeast addition increased (P <. 001) the asymptotic GP of concentrates compared to forages. Concentrate feeds had higher (P <. 05) GP and lower (P <. 001) rate of GP compared to forages without yeast. From 24 to 70 h of incubation, forages with or without yeast had lower (P <. 05) GP compared to concentrates with yeast addition. Forages had higher fermentation pH compared to concentrates, but lower (P <. 05) metabolizable energy (ME), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) and microbial protein production (MBP) compared to concentrates. Yeast addition increased (P <. 05) the asymptotic GP of oat grain and soybean meal, without affecting the rate of GP or lag time of both. Yeast treatment improved fermentation of feeds with higher effects on concentrates compared to forage.

40|$|Growth for Pistillaria micans was {{greatest}} at 25 ˚C while maximum {{and minimum}} temperatures for vegetative growth were about 30 °and 10 ° respective 1 y. Under slightly anaerobic conditions, the optimum temperature was somewhere between 15 ˚C and 20 ˚C. Changing the photoperiod (continuous dark or alternating light/dark) after 8 days {{did not produce}} changes in growth. Relative humidity {{had little or no}} effect on growth or reproduction. Pistillaria micans was unable to tolerate acidic conditions and growth was favored neutral to alkaline conditions (pH 7. 1 - 7. 5). Light was inhibitory to fruit body production and a minimum of 48 hours in continuous darkness was required tor basidiocarp development. Fruit body production was specifically inhibited in the blue region (395 nm). When the blue light region was omitted, (as in red light, in NUV light, and in dark treatments), fruit body production was stimulated in the-near-ultraviolet region (313 nm). Growth occurred when dextrose, fructose, sucrose, galactose, soluble starch, cellulose was the sole carbon source. The best growth occurred when sucrose was the sole carbon source while growth on galactose was significantly poor. No growth occurred when ammonium sulfate or potassium nitrate was the sole nitrogen source, while growth was slight on asparagine and glycine. Casein hydrolysate, urea and peptone were good nitrogen sources. Vegetative growth occurred on the following media: rabbit food agar (RF), corn meal+malt and yeast extract (CMMY), corn <b>meal,</b> <b>oat</b> agar, Hau leaves in agar, V- 8, corn meal+yeast extract + dextrose (CMYD), potato dextrose agar (PDA), Blakeslee's malt extract (ME(Bl.)), and Czapek agar.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that dietary fibre, especially soluble dietary fibre, has beneficial effects and can prevent diseases associated with the modern lifestyle. This has been explained by the viscous effects of soluble fibre, which can reduce or delay the absorption of carbohydrates and fat in the small intestine, resulting in lower blood concentrations of glucose, insulin and cholesterol. Oats, rye, sugar beet fibre and barley, all recognised for their high content of soluble fibre, were investigated in this work. The ability of fibres to form viscous solutions {{is determined by the}} concentration, solubility, the polymer molar mass and aggregate formation. The fibre releasability (solubility) and solution behaviour were analysed under physiological conditions {{to examine the effects of}} processing, the surrounding matrix and gastrointestinal conditions. Less than half of the β-glucans was released from oat bran when analysed with an in vitro method imitating gastrointestinal digestion, and the same was found regarding the release of pectin from coarse particles of sugar beet fibre. Reducing the particle size by milling improved the releasability, while mixing the milled fractions with a solid food matrix (protein, fat or starch) decreased or delayed it. The effect of food processing on barley β-glucan aggregation was studied using asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation. Boiling was shown to disrupt the largest aggregates, while higher temperatures also seemed to degrade the polymer chain. Freeze-thaw cycles resulted in cryogelation, which could lead to reduced viscosity. The low pH in the in vitro gastric digestion phase also disrupted the aggregates, but this was followed by re-aggregation/gelation at the neutral pH mimicking the conditions in the small intestine. This may entrap nutrients in the aggregate or gel matrix, thereby reducing absorption. A human study was performed with oats, rye and sugar beet fibre, and mixtures of these three. Fibre-rich meals were optimised to promote high releasability of fibre and retention of aggregates. Changes in traditional biomarkers, as well as in the transcriptome, in response to the fibre-rich meals, were examined in healthy men and women. The postprandial glucose levels were lowered by rye bran, while oat bran lowered the insulin concentrations. The lowering effects may be related to fibre source, the amount of soluble and insoluble fibre and pre-processing of the fibre. In contrast, a spray-dried oat drink increased the postprandial levels of insulin, possibly due to its low fibre content in combination with certain amino acids and a high amount of carbohydrates in the liquid matrix. Women showed, on average, a more pronounced glucose lowering response than men, indicating that different amounts of dietary fibre should be recommended for men and women. Changes in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after the intake of oat bran were investigated with microarray analysis. Gene sets and pathways related to insulin secretion were significantly suppressed in response to the <b>oat</b> bran <b>meal</b> compared with the control meal. In conclusion, many factors may influence the properties of dietary fibre. It is therefore valuable to use in vitro methods to simulate gastrointestinal digestion to characterise and optimise fibre functionality prior to testing their effects on human metabolism and the transcriptome...|$|R

40|$|Cereal {{products}} {{are the most}} important source of dietary fibre (DF). The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate physiological effects of DF-rich oatbased extrudates from the whole-grain type in vivo. A series of extrudates was prepared from whole-grain <b>oat</b> <b>meal,</b> oat bran and Novelose 330. These products differed in their contents of soluble and insoluble DF as well as of â-glucan and resistant starch. Rats (10 per group) were fed a control diet or test diets containing 50 % of these extrudates for 6 weeks. Further, 12 healthy human subjects consumed 100 g/day of an extrudate from <b>oat</b> <b>meal</b> and Novelose 330 (80 / 20) additionally to their habitual diet for 4 weeks. In dependence on the DF composition and concentration, higher formation and absorption of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were found in rats as a result of DF fermentation in the caecum and colon. Under the oat-based diets, the composition of the microflora and plasma lipid parameters were slightly changed. Caecum weights and caecal contents were higher in the test groups. In contrast to control, concentrations of bile acids (BA) and neutral sterols (NS) were greater in caecal and colonic contents as well as their excretion. The amount and proportion of secondary BA decreased as a result of lower pH values in intestinal contents of the experimental groups. Weight gain was not changed but rats of test groups consumed more water. The extrudate was well accepted by the human subjects. After 4 weeks of extrudate intake, concentrations of SCFA, including of butyrate, were increased in faeces. The higher DF consumption correlated with higher BA and NS concentrations in faeces. Most of these parameters reached their original levels 2 weeks after the experiment. Administration of DF-rich extrudates from whole-grain oatbased products results in beneficial physiological effects and may be helpful to increase the DF intake in humans.

The effects of dietary fiber type (cellulose, pectin or <b>oat</b> bran) and <b>meal</b> frequency (gorge or nibble) on colonic short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in vivo colonic pH and epithelial cell proliferation were examined in male Sprague-Dawley rats. In vivo cell proliferation was measured by [3 H]-thymidine incorporation into DNA. Luminal SCFAs were determined by gas chromatography. ber t e. The pectin and oat bran diets produced higher concentrations of all types of SCFAs and of total SCFA than did the cellulose diet at all sites. The higher the concentration of total SCFA in colonic contents, the lower the pH in cecum, proximal and distal colon (r=- O. 92, - 0. 97, - 0. 88; p= 0. 01, 0. 001, 0. 02 respectively). Dry fecal weights were lowest with pectin supplementation and the highest with cellulose. The oat bran diet resulted in an intermediate fecal weight. There were significant negative correlations between pH and crypt height (HC) (r=-O. 833, p= 0. 04); total cells per crypt (TC) (r=-O. 817, p= 0. 05); labeling index (LI) (r=-O. 926, p= 0. 008); and proliferation zone (PZ) (r=-O. 981, p= 0. 0005) in the cecum. There were significant positive correlations between the concentration of total SCFA and HC, TC and PZ (r= 0. 961, 0. 963, 0. 845; p= 0. 01, 0. 002, 0. 03) in the cecum. No correlation was found between pH or SCFA and cell proliferation in the distal colon, although there were effects of fiber type on H(@, LI and PZ (p= 0. 03, 0. 03, 0. 07). The pectin diet produced a higher HC, TC, and PZ in the cecum and LI in the distal colon than did the cellulose diet (p < 0. 05). The oat bran diet resulted in higher HC, TC, LI and PZ than the cellulose diet in the cecum., but lower LI and PZ and higher HC than the pectin diet in the distal colon (p< 0. 05). Meal frequency. Effect of meal pattern was observed on HC and TC (p= 0. 0003, 0. 0086) in the distal colon. HC and TC were larger in the gorging group than in the nibbling group (p < 0. 05). The results indicate that dietary fiber type affects the concentrations of SCFAS, pH, and cell proliferation throughout the large intestine; that effects of pH and concentrations of SCFAs on cell proliferation are found predominately in the cecum.

40|$|Com o objectivo de avaliar a influência do alimento nas características da carne de porco da raça Alentejana, para produção de carne fresca, testaram-se três alimentos: alimento {{comercial}} com 3200 kcal de Energia Digestível (ED) /kg e 18, 1 % de Proteína Bruta (PB), cereal (triticale) com 3300 kcal ED/kg e 13 %PB, e mistura de cereais (triticale e aveia) com bagaço de soja com 3200 kcal ED/kg e 17, 4 % PB. Cada alimento foi distribuído de modo a fornecer 4250 kcal/dia entre os 30 e os 40 kg de peso vivo, aumentando posteriormente até às 6800 kcal/dia dos 60 aos 70 kg, diminuindo progressivamente até às 4800 kcal/dia dos 90 aos 100 kg de peso vivo. O ensaio foi delineado em 2 blocos casualizados com 3 parques por bloco e 8 animais em cada parque. Os animais, de raça Alentejana, iniciaram o estudo com 35 kg de peso vivo (PV) e foram abatidos aos 100 kg. Após o abate foram desmanchadas (desmacha comercial) 4 carcaças de cada parque e recolhidas amostras do músculo Longissimus dorsi (LD), posteriormente congeladas a – 20 ºC até ao momento da análise. Sobre as amostras de lombo, em laboratório procederam-se às seguintes determinações: pH, CRA (capacidade de retenção de água), cor (CIE LAB), humidade, teor de gordura intramuscular e teor de pigmentos totais. Os resultados relativos ao pH, CRA, cor, teor de gordura intramuscular e teor de pigmentos totais não apresentaram diferenças significativas. Quanto aos teores de humidade, os animais alimentados com triticale apresentaram valores significativamente mais baixos (68, 8 %) do que os do alimento comercial e da mistura (71, 1 % e 71, 3 % respectivamente), o que está de acordo com o maior teor em lípidos intramusculares presentes no lombo dos animais alimentados com triticale, apesar de as diferenças serem não significativas. Concluímos que os três alimentos testados tiveram pouca influência na variação das características físicoquímicas analisadas, mas influenciaram significativamente quer a quantidade de músculo produzido, quer o seu peso relativo na carcaça. With the aim {{of evaluating}} the influence of foodstuff in the meat characteristics of the Alentejano pig, bred for fresh meat production, we tested three different foodstuffs: a commercial foodstuff with 3200 kcal of Digestible Energy (DE) per kg and 18, 1 % Crude Protein (CP), a cereal grain (triticale) with 3300 kcal DE per kg and 13 % CP and a mixture of cereal (triticale and <b>oat)</b> with soybean <b>meal</b> with 3200 kcal DE per kg and 17, 4 % CP. Each foodstuff was fed to the animals in order to supply 4250 kcal/day of DE to animals between 30 and 40 kg of live weight, and then the amount fed increased gradually, up to 6800 kcal/day, when animals weighted between 60 and 70 kg; finally, the supplied energy decreased down to 4800 kcal/day, to animals from 90 to 100 kg of live weight. The experiment was delineated in 2 randomized blocks, with 3 parks per block and 8 animals in each park. The Alentejana breed animals began the experiment weighting 35 kg, and were sacrificed when they reached 100 kg of live weight. After slaughter, samples from the Longissimus dorsi muscle of 4 animals from each park were taken and frozen at - 20 ºC. These samples were kept frozen until the analytical procedures took place. The laboratorial determinations were pH, Water Holding Capacity (WHC), colour (CIE LAB), moisture, percentage of intramuscular fat, and total pigments. The results for pH, WHC, colour, intramuscular lipids and total pigments did not present significant differences among themselves. As for moisture, animals fed with triticale showed significantly lower values (68, 8 %) than animals fed with commercial foodstuff and cereal grain (71, 1 % and 71, 3 %, respectively), which agrees with their higher percentage of intramuscular fat (even though not statistically different). We concluded that the 3 tested foodstuffs were of little or no influence in the variation of the analysed physicochemical characteristics, but significantly influenced both the amount of muscle and its relative weight in the carcass...|$|R
