5|$|In Dearborn, US12 intersects US24 (Telegraph Road) at an {{interchange}} on {{the western}} side of the city, and M-39 (Southfield Freeway) on the eastern side near the River Rouge crossing and Greenfield Village. On the Dearborn–Detroit city border, US12 pass through a complex interchange with I-94 (Edsel Ford Freeway) and M-153 (Ford Road/Wyoming Avenue). Michigan Avenue continues northeasterly parallel to I-94 for a short distance before it turns due east. Once it makes the direction change, it forms the 0 Mile of Detroit's Mile Road System. US12 continues through residential areas on Detroit's West Side, passing through the interchange that connects I-75 with I-96's eastern terminus near the Ambassador Bridge. The highway runs through Corktown, Detroit and beside the site of the former Tiger Stadium at the corner <b>of</b> <b>Michigan</b> <b>and</b> Trumbull. East of the former stadium, US12 crosses M-10 (Lodge Freeway) near the MGM Grand Detroit casino. East of M-10, Michigan Avenue enters Downtown Detroit.

5|$|According to a 2011 study {{conducted}} at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California Berkeley, the currently estimated reserve base of lithium {{should not be}} a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles, as the study estimated that on the order of 1 billion 40 kWh Li-based batteries (about 10kg of lithium per car) could be built with current reserves, as estimated by the U.S. Geological Survey. Another 2011 study by researchers from the University <b>of</b> <b>Michigan</b> <b>and</b> Ford Motor Company found that there are sufficient lithium resources to support global demand until 2100, including the lithium required for the potential widespread use of hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles. The study estimated global lithium reserves at 39 million tons, and total demand for lithium during the 90-year period analyzed at 12–20 million tons, depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates.|$|E

5|$|After the loss, MacShara {{withdrew from}} the case but Rudzewicz appealed the {{decision}} to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In the filing, Rudzewicz claimed that since they were residents <b>of</b> <b>Michigan,</b> <b>and</b> because the claims did not arise within the Southern District of Florida, that District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. Additionally Rudzewicz argued that the long-arm statute violated the 14th Amendment and was unconstitutional. Citing a similar case, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, the Appeals court agreed with the defendants and overturned the lower court's decision. The court also agreed with Rudzewicz's assertion of the constitutionality of Florida's long arm statute in its application to the case.|$|E

5|$|Elcor sat atop {{a bed of}} {{taconite}} {{consisting of}} a uniform mixture of about 30% iron, interspersed with pockets of high-grade ore, {{a part of the}} Biwabik iron formation. The Biwabik iron formation is a large sheet of iron-bearing sediment deposited during the Precambrian era {{on the bottom of the}} Animikie Sea. This iron-bearing rock extends under Lake Superior from the Mesabi and Vermilion Iron Ranges, to the Gogebic Iron Range from northern Wisconsin into the Marquette Range of the upper peninsula <b>of</b> <b>Michigan,</b> <b>and</b> west to the manganese-rich ore of the Cuyuna Iron Range. Michigan's steel-blue high grade ores were quite different from the Mesabi ore, which was soft brown hematite. There is iron in other areas of Minnesota, but no longer in quantities that are practical to mine.|$|E

Also in 1994, the school began offering a minor in management. By 1998, the school's endowment had reached $40million and the Institute of Public Management was renamed in honor of George W.

5|$|In {{the age of}} {{the auto}} trail, the roads that later formed US2 through the UP were given a few {{different}} highway names. When the original roadways between Ironwood and Iron River were completed in late 1915, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau (UPDB) named the area Cloverland and the highway the Cloverland Trail. Later the name was extended over the highway to Escanaba, and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s; the name was phased out by the UPDB completely in 1927. The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, by way <b>of</b> <b>Michigan</b> <b>and</b> the Canadian province of Ontario. Through the UP, the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US2, including the section through Florence County, Wisconsin.|$|E
