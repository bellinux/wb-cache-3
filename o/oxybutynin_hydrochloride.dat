40|$|The {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} <b>oxybutynin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> was studied on 21 patients with neurogenic bladder or unstable bladder complaining of urinary frequency, urgency and urgent incontinence. <b>Oxybutynin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (1 mg/tablet) was administered orally for 26. 7 days, on average, 3 mg {{per day in}} 3 and 6 mg per day in 18 patients and the usefulness of this drug was assessed subjectively and objectively. Of 21 patients treated, 9 had neurogenic bladder and 10 had unstable bladder. Urinary frequency was normalized in 6 out of 16 (37. 5 %), urgency ceased in 6 out of 17 (35. 7 %) and urgent incontinence disappeared in 9 out of 14 (50 %) patients. The mean volume at the first desire to void and the maximum cystometric capacity increased significantly on the cystometrogram after the administration of <b>oxybutynin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (p less than 0. 01). Furthermore, the maximum vesical pressure decreased significantly (p less than 0. 05). The maximum urinary flow rate increased slightly (p less than 0. 1) and the residual urine volume significantly increased (p less than 0. 05) after medication, although no changes were observed in tidal voiding volume or mean urinary flow rate. Of 20 patients, 9 showed improvement globally (45 %), although no subjective or objective improvement was observed in 4 (20 %) patients. Marked side effects were observed in 5 cases (two of acute urinary retention, each of increased urgency, residual urine and liver dysfunction), and side effects were seen in 10 of the 21 (47. 6 %) patients.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} long-term administration of <b>oxybutynin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> in patients with neurogenic bladder and unstable bladder, who complained of urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence, and whose bladder was proved to be uninhibited, reflex, and/or low compliant, were studied at the multi-center hospitals, and the following results were obtained. This study comprised 149 cases but 8 of them {{were excluded because of}} the incomplete protocol. Thus, 141 cases (104 neurogenic bladder patients, 33 unstable bladder patients and 4 others) were investigated. The daily dosage of <b>Oxybutynin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> ranged from 1 to 18 mg, and averaged at 6. 6 mg. Since a small daily dosage of 3 mg was administered in 32 cases to examine the minimum effective dosage of the drug, the low average dosage possibly resulted. The clinical optimal dosage seemed to be more than 6. 6 mg. The average period of administration in all cases was 161. 7 days (1 - 336 days), and the drug was discontinued in 46 cases (33. 6 %) on average 62. 1 days (1 - 141 days). The rate of global improvement by this drug estimated at the time of completion was found to be 65. 6 % with excellent and good and 87. 8 % with excellent, good and fair. The efficacy of this drug was stable and not decreased during the long-term test period. As to the objective findings studied before, during and after the drug administration, cystometric bladder capacity was significantly increased both first desire to void and the total capacity. Voided volume and residual urine were also increased, but there was no change in the rate of residual urine. Side effects were observed in 37 (26. 2 %) of 141 cases, and mainly gastrointestinal signs such as dry mouth and constipation. Urological signs such as dysuria and urinary retention were experienced in 8 cases. Regarding the findings of laboratory tests, there were no abnormality except for small changes of some items in normal range. Six children who were younger than 15 years old were subjected to this study. The results of evaluation were similar to those obtained on adults and no side effects were observed. From these findings, <b>oxybutynin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> is considered an effective and useful drug in patients suffering from neurogenic bladder and unstable bladder with over active bladder condition...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{effects and}} {{therapeutic}} usefulness of <b>oxybutynin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> were evaluated {{in a long-term}} clinical trial on patients with unstable bladders and neurogenic bladders. Of the 46 patients entered into the trial, 37 were those diagnosed with an unstable bladder and 9 with a neurogenic bladder with overactive detrusor. In 37 of the cases (80 %), the period of drug administration reached up to 12 weeks and in 16 cases (34 %) the drugs were administered for more than 24 weeks. The average administration period was 165. 9 days. The average total given dose was 1776. 9 mg and average dose per day was 10. 7 mg. Excellent and good responses were obtained in 76. 3, 88. 9 and 69. 6 % at 12 and 24 weeks after start of administration {{and at the time}} of discontinuing the drug, respectively. The cystometric changes at pre- and post-administration were evaluated on 23 cases and revealed a significant increase in volume at first sensation and maximum desire to void. Maximum resting intravesical pressure was significantly declined and uninhibited detrusor contractions were significantly suppressed. Side effects were noted in 11 of the 46 cases (23. 9 %), most of which were well tolerated by the patients. In 4 cases the drug had to be discontinued because of the side effects. Dry mouth was the most common side effect, occupying almost half of the incidents. No significant abnormality was noted on blood laboratory data, blood pressure or heart rate, following the drug administration. In one case slight increase in serum glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase was encountered, but its relationship with the drug was obscure. The clinical usefulness of this drug (excellent and good) was 78. 9, 88. 9 and 69. 6 % at 12 and 24 weeks after start of administration, and at the time of drug discontinuation, respectively. The present long-term trial proved that <b>oxybutynin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> is an exceedingly effective and safe agent for clinical management of unstable bladder and overactive neurogenic bladder...|$|E
40|$|<b>Oxybutynin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (Oxy), {{the first}} choice drug used for the {{management}} of urinary incontinence, is available in different types of formulations. However, due to its better lipophylicity and permeability, Oxyfree base was used in the new topical formulations such as transdermal patch and gel. The presence of an unprecedented impurity (Oxy-EK) in transdermal patches led to reinvestigate the chemical stability of Oxyfree base in oxidative conditions assigning, to Oxy-EK, the structure of (3 E) - 4 -(N,N-diethylamino) - 2 -oxo- 3 -buten- 1 -yl 1 -cyclohexyl- 1 -phenylglycolate. Oxy-EK arises from the prototropic rearrangement of oxybutynin N-oxides leading to the formation of an enamino ketone function which shows a long-wavelength UV-absorption. The total synthesis of Oxy-EK was performed, allowing to propose it as the indicator of stability for oxidative degradation of Oxy free base in transdermal formulations. The presence in the structure of Oxy-EK of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl function, a potential Michael acceptor, suggested the need of evaluating its possible mutagenic power. Accordingly, the Ames test was performed: at nontoxic concentrations, Oxy-EK did not increase the number of revertant colonies in all strains tested both in the absence and presence of the exogenous metabolic activator S 9...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{relationship}} between {{inflammatory bowel disease}} and MS {{is supported by a}} higher than expected coexistence of these diseases among families and individuals. A 32 year-old male with Crohn&# 146;s disease of the terminal ileum diagnosed 4 years earlier and HLA-B 27 bilateral sacroiliitis diagnosed two years earlier, was admitted to our hospital because of an acute episode of blurred vision. In addition the patient complained of urine incontinence. Before this admission the patient had been elsewhere administered three doses of Remicade and 16 mg of methylprednisolone p. os. During admission the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was made (MRI and IgG Index) and Remicade was discontinued. The patient was started on therapy with interferon-beta for MS, <b>oxybutynin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (10 mg/day) for urine incontinence, prednizolone (10 mg/day), methotrexate (10 mg/week) and azathioprine (100 mg/day) for Crohn&# 146;s disease and is now in excellent clinical status.

40|$|The oral osmotic {{oxybutynin}} {{release system}} (Oros), allowing once-daily administration, improves the oxybutynin tolerability over the immediate-release formulation. However, Oros manufacture requires a specialized technology. Therefore an {{attempt was made}} to design oxybutynin matrix tablets for once-daily administration in the treatment of urinary incontinence. Matrices (weight, 50 mg; diameter, 6 mm; dose, 5 mg) were prepared by compression, and the drug release kinetics in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids (SGF and SIF, respectively) were measured in vitro. Matrices intended to release the drug by diffusion were based on glycerol palmitostearate. This matrix type released the drug only in SGF. In SIF release stopped, due to the conversion, inside the matrix, of the freely water-soluble <b>oxybutynin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> into the virtually insoluble free base form. Erodible matrices were based on Eudragit L 100 (EUD L) or on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). Release in SIF from the former was either too slow or non-reproducible, depending on the EUD L fraction in matrix. Erosion-controlled oxybutynin release in SIF from matrices-based on PEO hydrogel was time-independent and depended on polymer MW and on dissolution medium hydrodynamics. A gastroprotected tablet based on a PEO of MW 5000 kDa released the dose in SIF at the rate of about 6 %/h, appropriate for once-daily administration...|$|E
40|$|Clean {{intermittent}} (self) catheterisation (CIC) {{in combination}} with oral anticholinergic drugs (<b>oxybutynin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> [OH] is the present standard therapy for neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NBD) with detrusor hyperactivity. However, complete suppression of detrusor contractions and complete urinary continence is not always obtained despite maximal dosage, and {{the high incidence of}} severe systemic anticholinergic side-effects often impairs therapeutic compliance, resulting in dose reduction or even discontinuation of therapy. The intravesical administration of OH has been shown recently to be an effective alternative for treating persistent detrusor hyperactivity, and occurrence and severity of systemic side-effects appeared to be significantly decreased. However, available data are limited from a paediatric view. Furthermore, it is our belief that the use of crushed OH tablets with consequent problems of impracticability accounts for the variable long-term patient compliance reported to be the only disadvantage to intravesical OH. Using an optimized drug preparation we demonstrate the superiority of intravesical OH for treatment of NBD in 15 children (range 0. 6 - 13. 75 years, mean 6. 1) with incomplete detrusor activity suppression and/or intolerable systemic side-effects on oral OH therapy. Since the previous reported problems of impracticability and variable long-term patient compliance can be resolved by optimized drug preparation, we therefore conclude that the era of crushing OH tablets should be over in order to allow the intravesical OH therapy on a long-lasting and large-scale basis. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Summary. A {{method to}} obtain and {{guarantee}} a multidose sterile oxybutynin solution useful in treating pediatric neurogenic bladder. Objective. <b>Oxybutynin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> {{represents one of}} the anticholinergic drugs used in pediatric neurogenic bladder, and it is available either orally in generic formulation as tablets and syrup, or as a transdermal patch and as a topical gel. Despite the efficacy of oxybutynin, these systemic delivery systems present significant side effects, and therefore {{a number of studies have}} explored an intravesical oxybutynin solution as an alternative. Since a commercial intravesical oxybutynin solution for use in pediatric neurogenic bladder is currently not available, it could be useful to find a method to guarantee the sterility of prepared oxybutynin solution in order to prevent bacterial growth in the urinary tract after catheterization. Methods. A simple method to prepare a stable and sterile multidose solution of oxybutynin for pediatric neurogenic bladder was developed. The stability of the solution was evaluated using two techniques: ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometry and spectrometric Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) ”. In order to maximize the sensitivity of both the proposed methods solvent system, wavelength of detection, and mass spectrometry conditions were optimized. Results. No spectrum changes have been observed with UV/Vis method and no quantitative modification has been noticed in the NMR method. The solution after six months conforms perfectly with that calculated on the same solution when initially prepared. Conclusions. It was concluded that both methods that were developed are equally accurate, sensitive, precise, reproducible, and efficient, and both could be applied directly and easily to evaluate the pharmaceutical preparation of oxybutynin. The stability and sterility of the oxybutynin solution were determined to last six months...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Flexible dosing of anticholinergics {{used for}} overactive bladder (OAB) {{treatment}} {{is a useful}} strategy in clinical practice for achieving a maximum effective and maximum tolerated level of therapeutic benefit. In this post hoc analysis we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of trospium chloride treatment for urinary urge incontinence (UUI) with focus on flexible dosing. Methods The data came from a 12 -week, randomised, double-blind, phase IIIb study in which 1658 patients with urinary frequency plus urge incontinence received trospium chloride 15 mg TID (n = 828) or 2. 5 mg <b>oxybutynin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> TID (n = 830). After four weeks, daily doses were doubled and not readjusted in 29. 2 % (242 / 828) of patients in the trospium group, and in 23. 3 % (193 / 830) in the oxybuytnin group, {{until the end of}} treatment. We assessed the absolute reduction in weekly UUI episodes and the change in intensity of dry mouth, recorded in patients' micturition diaries. Adverse events were also evaluated. Statistics were descriptive. Results Dose escalation of either trospium or oxybutynin increased reduction in UUI episodes in the population studied. At study end, there were no relevant differences between the "dose adjustment" subgroups and the respective "no dose adjustment" subgroups (trospium: P = 0. 249; oxybutynin: P = 0. 349). After dose escalation, worsening of dry mouth was higher in both dose adjusted subgroups compared to the respective "no dose adjustment" subgroups (P P Conclusions Flexible dosing of trospium was proven to be as effective, but better tolerated as the officially approved adjusted dose of oxybutynin.

Methods: Using electronic medication records from 142 community pharmacies, outpatients older than 40 years of age taking DPZ, with or without other prescription medicines, were assessed over 6 years, beginning in 2007. We estimated the number of medicines administered along with DPZ, the number of anticholinergics administered along with DPZ, and the medicines&# 39; anticholinergic cognitive burden (ACB) scale cumulative score {{based on data from}} the top four pharmacies that filled the highest number of prescriptions for DPZ for outpatients with dementia in 2010. Data were gathered from records of 431 patients; only three patients were younger than 60 years. Results: There was a 1. 94 -fold {{increase in the number of}} prescriptions including DPZ over 6 years. The proportion of patients to whom other medicines were administered along with DPZ was 65. 6 % (n= 283) and the proportion of those taking at least one anticholinergic agent was 24. 1 % (n= 104). The mean number of medicines among subjects taking at least one anticholinergic was 5. 7, and the mean cumulative ACB score for anticholinergics contained in these medicines was 2. 6. Among 104 patients to whom the anticholinergics were administered along with DPZ, two outpatients taking urologic medicines such as <b>oxybutynin</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> or tolterodine tartrate were found. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that it is necessary to pay attention to a decline in cognitive function when prescribing multiple medicines, especially to elderly patients who have already been prescribed DPZ.
