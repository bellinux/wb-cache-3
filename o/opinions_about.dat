40|$|The {{accident}} at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011 greatly affected attitudes toward nuclear energy in many countries, including Switzerland. In this study, we analyzed {{the evolution of}} public <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> nuclear energy in Switzerland from 2012 to 2014 to determine how different dimensions of attitudes toward nuclear energy changed {{in the years following}} the accident and which factors influenced general <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> nuclear energy. The primary findings show that public <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> nuclear energy became only slightly more positive as time passed and that the most important predictor of the general <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> nuclear energy was the individual assessment of its benefits and risk...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to look at the common <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> {{children}} in Cambodia. By interviewing the professionals in different help organizations we studied the common <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> children in general and the common <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> children who are exposed to sexual trafficking. The ambition of the study was also to see if the common <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> children in Cambodia affects the help that is available for the children who are exposed to sexual trafficking. This is a qualitative study including semi structured interviews with seven professionals who work with vulnerable children. The interview guide focused on the themes: children’s needs, sexual trafficking, children’s rights, childhood, children’s sexuality and gender. The study shows that the cultural context is a substantial factor when looking at the common <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> children in Cambodia. The result indicates that children almost have an invisible position in the society and that children are looked upon as a passive individual in relation to its family. There’s little understanding of the concept of children’s needs and children’s rights in the Cambodian society. If children’s needs are mentioned, the psychical needs and the need of education are mostly discussed. The result also shows how the common <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> children to some extent affects the help interventions of the organizations. Other factors that influence the help are the values of the professionals and the organization’s basic values. The result of the study indicates significant differences when it comes to the common <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> girls and boys. This becomes clear when looking at how the social roles of the girls and boys differ in the household and in the society. The gender differences are distinct in the common <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> sexuality. The representation of childhood in Cambodia, many times deviates from the common <b>opinion</b> <b>about</b> childhood in the western countries. The stories of the professionals show tendencies of how the common <b>opinion</b> is <b>about</b> to change into a more western approach on how to think about children and that many organizations work with the problem of sexual trafficking...|$|R

In his autobiography, Baggio stated Lippi had dumped him after Baggio refused to point out which of Inter's players had expressed negative <b>opinions</b> <b>about</b> the coach, also highlighting an incident during a training session where he called out Christian Vieri and Christian Panucci for applauding Baggio for a notable assist.|$|E
5|$|Suillus spraguei {{grows in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with several pine species, particularly eastern white pine, and the fruit bodies grow on the ground, appearing from early summer to autumn.

The mushroom is edible, although <b>opinions</b> <b>about</b> its quality vary. The mushroom bears a resemblance to several other Suillus species, including the closely related S.decipiens, although the species can be differentiated by variations in color and size.|$|E

David lambasts the mother and society in general; the two embrace in a kiss before going to bed together.

Many other parallels and inversions abound, including: the difference of <b>opinions</b> <b>about</b> the ease of getting what is sought from the underworld (the Sibyl says only the initial descent to the underworld will be easy, whereas Erichtho says necromancy is simple), the opposing manner in which those seeking information from the underworld are described (the Sibyl urges Aeneas to be courageous, whereas Erichtho criticizes Sextus Pompeius for being cowardly), and the inverted {{manner in which the}} supernatural rites proceed (the Sibyl sends Aeneas underground to gain knowledge, whereas Erichtho conjures a spirit up out of the ground to learn the future).|$|E

5|$|Throughout 1915 and 1916, Kropotkin, {{who lived}} in Brighton, England, was often in poor health. He was unable to travel during the winter, having been ordered {{not to do so}} by doctors in January 1915, and {{underwent}} two operations to his chest in March. As a result, he was confined to a bed for the majority of 1915 and to a wheeled bath-chair in 1916. During this time, Kropotkin kept a steady correspondence with other anarchists, including fellow Russian anarchist Marie Goldsmith. Goldsmith and Kropotkin clashed often on their <b>opinions</b> <b>about</b> the World War, the role of internationalism during the conflict, and whether it was possible to advocate antimilitarism during that period (early 1916). As explained above, Kropotkin took firmly pro-war positions during these communiques, as he was predisposed to frequently criticize the German Empire.|$|E
