40|$|Abstract. Vehicle {{stability}} in 4 wheel drive(4 WD) vehicles has been pursued by torque split based technology and brake based technology. The brake based methods are essentially brake maneuver strategies using the active {{control of the}} individual wheel brake. By comparison, the torque split based technologies realize stability by varying the traction torque split through powertrain to create an <b>offset</b> yaw <b>moment.</b> In the 4 WD hybrid electric vehicle adopting separate front and rear motor, the vehicle stability enhancement algorithm using the rear motor control has some advantages such as faster response, braking energy recuperation, etc. However, since {{the left and right}} wheels are controlled by the same driving and regenerative torque from one motor, stability enhancement only by the front and rear motor control has a limitation in satisfying the required <b>offset</b> yaw <b>moment.</b> Therefore, to obtain the demanded <b>offset</b> yaw <b>moment,</b> a brake force distribution at each wheel is required. In this paper, a vehicle stability control logic using the front and rear motor and electro-hydraulic brake(EHB) is proposed for a 4 WD hybrid electric vehicle. A fuzzy control algorithm is suggested to compensate the error of the sideslip angle and the yaw rate by generating the direct yaw moment. Performance of the vehicle stability control algorithm is evaluated using ADAMS and MATLAB Simulink co-simulation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A hybrid {{technique}} {{for the analysis}} of pyramidal and conical horn antennas is presented based on an exact vector Dirichlet to Neumann (DtN) mapping mathematical formalism. The transition from the feeding waveguide to the radiating aperture is analyzed by using the mode matching technique (MMT) employing a steppedwaveguide approach. Love’s field equivalence principle is employed for the definition of equivalent electric and magnetic current densities at the horn aperture. Explicitly, these currents are located at a plane parallel to the aperture but slightly shifted inwards in order to implement an <b>offset</b> <b>Moment</b> Method for their discretization, which is free of integral singularities. The unbounded area field generated by these sources is enforced to be continuous with the internal mode matching field by strictly following DtN principles. Besides that, this procedure mimics a By-moment approach ensuring the decoupling of the required number of modes from that of the sources discretization degrees of freedom. Finally, the implemented hybrid method is validated against published experimental and numerical results for a number of pyramidal and conical horn antennas including various corrugated geometries. 1...|$|R

40|$|We report {{magnetic}} measurements up to 1200 K on three different multi-walled carbon nanotube mat samples using Quantum Design vibrating sample magnetometers. Three different samples prepared from arc discharge or {{chemical vapor deposition}} contain magnetic impurities ranging from about 100 ppm to about 1. 5 %. Our precise magnetic data clearly show two superconducting transitions, one at temperatures between 533 K and 700 K, and another at about 1200 K. The first transition temperature T_cJ, which coincides with the transition temperature seen in the resistance data, depends very strongly on the magnetic field, as expected from the onset of intergrain Josephson coupling in granular superconductors. The strong field dependence of T_cJ also excludes magnetic contaminants as {{the origin of the}} first transition. We also present direct and inferred diamagnetic Meissner fractions of 2 and 14 %, respectively.

Fifty-five subjects grouped by age (pre-pubescent (8 - 11 yrs); post-pubescent (19 - 29 yrs)) and gender jumped for a ball set at 50 % of their maximum VJ height then landed on two feet with only their dominant foot on the force plate. Statistical analyses of motion analysis (3 -D) and GRF data showed that children had greater valgus angles (p =. 003) and moments (p =. 026) at MGRFz compared to adults. Females had greater (p =. 016) valgus moments than males, but similar valgus angles at MGRFz.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} a four-storey building. The {{main part of the}} steel load-baring {{construction}} is represented by moment resisting frames that carry the entire vertical load and the horizontal load in the transverse direction. The secondary beams, together with the moment resisting frame columns form the four frames in the longitudinal direction. For the transfer of the horizontal loads in the longitudinal direction, three centric brace systems are placed on both outer frames. The internal forces for the ultimate limit states and displacements for the serviceability limit states are determined by the elastic global analysis, taking into account the second order analysis. The global imperfection is taken into account by a horizontal <b>offset</b> of the <b>moment</b> resisting frame. Seismic analysis is performed using latheral force method. The design is carried out in accordance with the rules for earthquake-resistant. The construction achieves a high ductility level. Fire resistance of the composite floor is defined with MACS+.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{two main}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{uncertainty in the}} measurement of paleoseismic offsets used to estimate fault activity and paleoearthquake magnitudes on normal faults: (1) That variations in fault geometry {{have a significant effect}} on throw-rates and fault offsets; and (2) that postseismic deformation can be a significant component of the total fault slip for moderate magnitude earthquakes. These hypotheses are tested using high resolution terrestrial laser scan datasets of normal fault topographic offsets and surface ruptures. The first hypothesis is addressed by studying the crustal scale Campo Felice active normal fault in the Central Apennines, Italy. Variation in throw-rate along strike since the last glacial maximum (15 ka ± 3) is measured from an offset periglacial surface at two hundred and fifty sites using cross sectional data derived from a high resolution terrestrial laser scan (TLS) dataset. The measurements are used to create a detailed throw-rate profile. Field measurements of fault geometry (strike, dip and kinematic slip direction) are also gathered. Variation in fault throw-rate is found to correlate with fault strike. A study of weathered band thickness on the exposed Miocene limestone bedrock fault scarp, thought to have been created by single past slip events on the fault also appears to correlate with fault strike. A strain-rate profile is calculated using the throw-rate profile and the field measurements of kinematic slip. In contrast to throw-rate, strainrate is independant of changes in fault strike and dip. It is suggested that strain-rate in comparison to throw-rate provides a more robust measure of fault activity as it is unaffected by changes in fault geometry. The outcome of this study is that paleoseismic studies on active faults should take into account fault geometry before choosing sites which may have anomalously high or low paleoseismic offsets. Fault geometry introduces significant uncertainty into the estimation of inferred paleoearthquake magnitudes from paleoseismic offsets and hence seismic hazard analysis. The second hypothesis is addressed through the study of near-field postseismic deformation (surface rupture afterslip) following the 6 th April 2009 6. 3 Mw L’Aquila earthquake, created by slip on the Paganica normal fault in the Central Italian Apennines. A novel use of TLS technology allowed the postseismic deformation at four sites along the L’Aquila surface rupture to be measured between 8 – 126 days after the earthquake. Complimentary measurements of postseismic deformation at a fifth site using a robotic total station were combined with the TLS datasets to describe the along strike variation in postseismic deformation. The near-field postseismic deformation measured occurred mostly in the immediate hangingwall of the surface rupture and increased with decreasing rate over time. The postseismic deformation measured is comparable to theoretical and empirical models which have been used to describe afterslip for previous earthquakes. The magnitude of near-field postseismic deformation was up to 60 % that of the coseismic offset in the near-field and suggests that postseismic deformation can form a significant component of paleoseismic offsets of moderate magnitude. Postseismic deformation was also found to be greatest above regions of the fault zone where a high coseismic slip gradient existed, suggesting that postseismic deformation occurs at the periphery of the coseismic slip patch within the fault zone. Regression relationships which relate surface <b>offset</b> to <b>moment</b> magnitude are populated by field observations of surface offsets where earthquake magnitude is known. These regression relationships are then used to infer paleoearthquake magnitudes from paleoseismic offsets. The field studies used to populate regression relationships do not routinely take into account the potential effects of fault geometry and significant postseismic slip. As a result paleoearthquake magnitudes inferred from such regression relationships are maybe over estimated. It is suggested that future regression relationships of surface <b>offset</b> and <b>moment</b> magnitude should factor in the effects of fault geometry and postseismic deformation in order to produce a relationship in which surface offset (both coseismic and postseismic) is described for a range of magnitudes and, where possible, any local effects of fault geometry are removed from the input dataset. The production of such a relationship will allow paleoseismologists to measure combined coseismic and postseismic offsets from field studies and to infer paleoearthquake magnitude with decreased uncertainty.

40|$|International audienceThe {{interaction}} of the solar wind (SW) with the magnetic field of Mercury is investigated {{by means of a}} three dimensional parallelized multispecies hybrid model. A comparison between two mathematical representations of Mercury's intrinsic magnetic field is studied. The first model is an Offset Dipole (OD) having the <b>offset</b> and dipolar <b>moment</b> reported by Anderson et al. (2011). The second model is a combination of a Dipole and a Quadrupole (DQ), the total field is fitted to the offset dipolar field, for northern latitudes greater than 50 °. Simulations reproduce the features which characterize Mercury's interaction with the SW, encompassing the Bow Shock (BS), the magnetosheath, the magnetotail, the "cusps" region and the neutral current sheet. Global hybrid simulations of the Hermean magnetosphere run for the OD and DQ models demonstrate that the southern parts of the magnetospheres produced by the OD and DQ models differ greatly in topology and volume meanwhile their northern parts-are quite similar. In particular the DQ model exhibits a dome of closed field lines around the south pole in contrast to the OD. Without further information on the intrinsic magnetic field of the planet in the southern region which should be provided by BepiColombo after year 2020, we can only speculate on the influence of the different magnetic topologies on the magnetospheric dynamics...|$|R
40|$|A {{small body}} {{rendezvous}} mission requires accurate gravity field characterization for safe, accurate navigation purposes. However, the current techniques of gravity field modeling around small bodies are not achieved {{to the level}} of satisfaction. This thesis will address how the process of current gravity field characterization can be made more robust for future small body missions. First we perform the covariance analysis around small bodies via multiple slow flybys. Flyby characterization requires less laborious scheduling than its orbit counterpart, simultaneously reducing the risk of impact into the asteroid 2 ̆ 7 s surface. It will be shown that the level of initial characterization that can occur with this approach is no less than the orbit approach. Next, we apply the same technique of gravity field characterization to estimate the spin state of 4179 Touatis, which is a near-Earth asteroid in close to 4 : 1 resonance with the Earth. The data accumulated from 1992 - 2008 are processed in a least-squares filter to predict Toutatis 2 ̆ 7 orientation during the 2012 apparition. The center-of-mass <b>offset</b> and the <b>moments</b> of inertia estimated thereof can be used to constrain the internal density distribution within the body. Then, the spin state estimation is developed to a generalized method to estimate the internal density distribution within a small body. The density distribution is estimated from the orbit determination solution of the gravitational coefficients. It will be shown that the surface gravity field reconstructed from the estimated density distribution yields higher accuracy than the conventional gravity field models. Finally, we will investigate two types of relatively unknown gravity fields, namely the interior gravity field and interior spherical Bessel gravity field, in order to investigate how accurately the surface gravity field can be mapped out for proximity operations purposes. It will be shown that these formulations compute the surface gravity field with unprecedented accuracy for a well-chosen set of parametric settings, both regionally and globally...|$|R
