40|$|International audienceThe {{coking process}} is {{composed}} of two main stages: drying process and pyrolysis of coal. A heat and mass transfer model was developed to simulate the drying process of coal. The mechanisms of heat and mass transfer described in the model are: conduction through the coal cake; conduction and convection through the gas in pores; generation, flux and condensation of water vapor. The model has been implemented in finite element software. It requires basic data on the coke <b>oven</b> <b>charge</b> properties and <b>oven</b> dimensions as input. These input data were obtained by experiments or from the literature. The proposed model includes condensation and evaporation allowing us to reproduce the temperature plateau observed experimentally...|$|R

40|$|The Reflux Classifier (RC) is a {{separation}} technique {{which has been}} used in the coal and mineral processing industries. It uses water as a medium, and is therefore a suitable preparation device for studies on coking coal as other separation techniques may change coking properties. The separation process was conducted by using a channel spacing of 3 mm between two adjacent plates (a deviation from the previous 1. 77 -mm spacing which promoted laminar flow). The 3 -mm channel gap which equated to nominal particle size of coking coal in coke <b>oven</b> <b>charge</b> could lead to a transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the separation process. By changing water flow rate in the separation system, two coals, one coking coal and one thermal coal with particle size of − 210 + 100 μm, were separated into different fractions. The fractions contained vitrinite-rich and inetinite-rich concentrates with vitrinite concentration between 28 – 84 % for the coking coal and 20 – 75 % for the thermal coal. In both coals, telovitrinite and semifusinite were the two maceral components of which concentration varied the most. The products relative density and ash yield both decreased with increasing vitrinite content without any apparent changes in the particle size distribution. The mineral content {{had a significant impact on}} maceral separation, especially in vitrinite-rich concentrates obtained at low water flow rates...|$|R

The carbonization of some low volatile matter coals {{for the production of}} metallurgical coke in slot type ovens is accompanied by the exertion of pressures on the walls which can be dangerous and destroy the walls. It is generally accepted that coking pressure originates from the volatile matter released from the coal being retained as pressurized vapours trapped within the plastic layer of the carbonizing coal charge. Pressure during carbonization also influences the nature of the carbon texture and the porous structure of coke is strongly dependent on volatile matter release during the plastic stage of the carbonization process. There is therefore a possible association of coking pressure, coke porous structure and coke carbon texture. Seven coals giving a variety of wall pressures, as measured in a movable-wall oven,ranging from safe to dangerously coking, were carbonized in a small laboratory oven. The textural compositions of the resultant cokes were assessed by polarized light microscopy while pore structural parameters were measured by computerized image analysis. The textural compositions varied with volatile matter content of the coals while the porosities varied linearly with the internal gas pressures measured in a single plastic layer. In an attempt to investigate possible relations between the pore structure development and internal gas pressures generated in a single plastic layer, polished surfaces showing the coal-to-coke transformation were prepared after quenching carbonized single-wall <b>oven</b> <b>charges.</b> These surfaces were studied by image analysis techniques to obtain measurements of the pore sizes as carbonization proceeded. Pore sizes generally rose to a maximum within the plastic temperature range before falling to the almost constant value seen in the semicoke. No systematic variation between the pore structure development and the internal gas pressures could be established...|$|R

50|$|Coke <b>ovens</b> were <b>charged</b> {{and emptied}} {{in a set}} pattern. Coal was shovelled into an empty oven to a height of {{approximately}} 0.6 metres and ignited. The door was bricked up or closed with an iron plate and plastered with a small hole left for the temporary admission of air. The upper layer of the coal burnt and initiated the distillation of volatile material from the ovens as they met the air supply drawn in through {{the top of the}} charging door. The dome was heated to a high temperature and assisted in carbonizing the charge by radiating its heat to the coal. The operation of the distillation and immediate combustion proceeded until the whole of the volatile matter in the coal had been evolved, which took about three days. The coke was then cooled by inserting a water sprinkler through the air hole in the door and was withdrawn manually with rakes. Almost two tonnes of coal was required to produce one tonne of coke.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Metallurgical coke for blast furnace and foundry use, and for some domestic boiler cokes are produced by carbonising coals in slot-type ovens. The coal is heated by heat transferred from the hot oven walls (usually 1250 °C) so that a temperature gradient is set up within the <b>oven</b> <b>charge.</b> A layer of plastic coal is formed (350 - 500 °C) which moves progressively towards the oven centre as carbonisation proceeds. Immediately after re-solidification, and again near 700 °C, the semi-coke suffers shrinkage as the carbon structure reorganises The post re-solidification shrinkage is the more severe and results in large, horizontal and vertical primary fissures being formed which allow breakage of the charge into lumps as it is pushed from the oven. A large central fissure, formed when the two plastic layers meet, divides the charge into two. Further breakage occurs at primary fissures on handling the coke after pushing. Smaller secondary fissures present in the resultant coke lump {{are believed to be}} a result of the shrinkage near 700 °C. Coke has three roles in the blast furnace: as a source of heat, a source of reducing agents and as a support for the burden. The latter function is particularly important {{at the bottom of the}} stack when coke is the only solid material present. The blast furnace output is dependent on the quantity of air that can be pushed up the stack. This depends on the permeability of the coke bed in the lower reaches of the stack. To maintain permeability, the coke should not suffer size degradation as it progresses down the stack; a mixture of large and small coke particles is disastrous. Thus coke quality tends to be assessed in terms of resistance to size degradation in a drum test. Size degradation occurs as a result of volumetric breakage at fissures and abrasion of surfaces. Brittle fracture theory suggests that volumetric breakage should occur as a result of the propagation of secondary fissures in coke lumps [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Coke is {{produced}} by heating finely crushed coal charge in air tight coke <b>ovens.</b> The coal <b>charge</b> mostly consists of blends of different coking coals {{and in some cases}} also partially briquetted charge coal. After carbonization, the coke is pushed from the ovens and quenched with water/inert gas (dry quenching). This hard and porous carbonaceous product acts mainly as a source of reductant for the reduction of iron ore, provides thermal energy and provides a permeable support for the burden materials in the blast furnace. Although coke is expensive, it is still indispensable for the production of liquid iron through Blast Furnace (BF) route. The Major functions of coke in BF are to provide heat for different endothermic reactions inside the BF and for melting of slag and metal, reducing gases required for the reduction of iron oxides, support and permeable bed during counter current flow of materials and gases in BF. Coke is the only solid material in the furnace that supports the iron bearing burden and provides a permeable bed necessary for slag and metal to pass down into the hearth and for hot gases to pass upwards in BF. Of the above mentioned three roles of BF coke, the first two can be substituted by oil, gas, plastics and non-coking coals. These are injected through tuyeres to generate heat and reducing gases. Such a substitution brings reduction in coke rates for the blast furnace (coke rate is the weight of coke required to produce one tonne of hot metal). However, there is no other satisfactory material available, which can replace, fully or partially, metallurgical coke as a permeable support of blast furnace charge materials (burden). Over the last few decades, coke quality requirements have become more stringent due to development of large capacity blast furnaces (>[*] 3500  m 3) and high pulverized coal injection (PCI)/coal dust injection (CDI) rates.|$|R
