5|$|Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game {{viewed from}} the third-person perspective. The playable {{character}} is visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> the camera can be freely rotated around him. The player controls Batman as he traverses Arkham Asylum, a secure facility for the criminally insane located {{off the coast of}} Gotham City. The opening areas of the game are linear, serving as a tutorial for the moves and approaches available to the player. Once the player emerges onto the island he can freely explore the game world, although some areas remain inaccessible until certain milestones in the main story. Batman can run, jump, climb, crouch, glide from heights using his cape, and use his grapple gun to climb low structures or escape to higher ledges.|$|E
5|$|Players {{navigate}} the witch protagonist through the 2D game world from a side-view perspective. Cauldron {{is divided into}} two modes of play: shooting while flying and jumping along platforms. Areas of the game world set on the surface feature the witch flying on a broom stick, while underground segments require the witch to run and jump in caverns. In the flying segments, players must search for four randomly scattered coloured keys to access underground areas that contain six ingredients. The objective is to collect the ingredients and return them to the witch's cottage to complete a spell that can defeat the Pumpking. While traversing the game world, the witch encounters Halloween-themed enemies such as pumpkins, ghosts, skulls, and bats, as well as other creatures like sharks and seagulls. A collision with an enemy causes the witch's magic meter (which is also used to fire offensive projectiles at enemies) to decrease. The character dies once the meter is depleted. After dying, the character reappears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> the meter is refilled. Players are given limited opportunities for this to occur, and the game ends once the number of lives reaches zero.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to the original The Legend of Zelda for the NES: the world is viewed from a top-down camera angle, it is divided up into many different squares that can fit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> <b>and</b> the main character can move up, down, left, and right across the screen. The player can interact with individuals within towns by gathering information and buying or selling items and equipment. A variety of enemies can be battled on a field screen to gain experience, GP, and items. Within dungeon areas, a number of puzzles may be present and required to be solved in order for the player to advance. The player can also save at any point. A number of weapons can be found throughout the game to maneuver through obstacles such as cutting through trees and thorns.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, Alexander S. Douglas created OXO, a {{software}} program for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC {{was one of the}} first stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human–computer interaction, Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game. The player entered input using a rotary telephone controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> <b>and</b> then the computer's move would follow. The game was not available to the general public, and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved. Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded. Around the same time, Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer, the Manchester Mark 1, culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a CRT display. Like OXO, the display was mostly static, updating only when a move was made. OXO and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen.|$|E
5|$|The designers' {{goal was}} to create a visual bridge between comic and video game graphics. Gibbons drew the {{backgrounds}} in pencil, starting with roughs, which were sent to Revolution to see if they were technically feasible. Once agreed upon, Gibbons would then make the final sketch. The pencil sketches were then colored, mainly by Les Pace. The backgrounds were scanned on a Macintosh as 24-bit, 1000x1000 pixel images with 16 million colors, and then transformed to 8-bit, 320x200 pixel images with 256 colors for the PC version. The backgrounds were designed so that the sprites would appear clear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> wouldn't mix with the backgrounds. Gibbons created the sprites using Deluxe Paint on an Amiga. Steve Ince, who joined the team in February 1993, created a number of sprite animations, also painting some backgrounds based on Gibbons's sketches. Gibbons also designed the characters, although he found it challenging to get a character's personality and expression in a face that was only around seven pixels wide and nine pixels high with a limited palette. He would have liked to design a character in a similar manner to Prince of Persia or Flashback, but Revolution wanted something more detailed, so the result became a compromise. All character sprites are smoothly animated with around 20 positions each. According to Gibbons, about 75% of the backgrounds and characters he designed were used in the game.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills walking {{around on a}} bridge, as she reminisces about her {{relationship}} with her boyfriend. As the song builds up to the first verse, they are depicted {{in the living room of}} a hazy-looking apartment, and Kills smiles at him, who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as opposed to what she is actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a short-haired man who is watching her performance smiles at her and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a bottle of vodka on the ground. After looking at him, she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of a leopard with glowing blue eyes (later {{revealed}} to be Kesha) walking down an alleyway. The song's title flashes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> the video pans to Kesha. She walks down the alleyway with two men who grab another man. Kesha spray-paints a dollar sign on his chest. They come to a party {{where she and her}} friends flash their tattooed dollar signs on their wrists and forearms in order to enter. As they enter, everyone starts dancing and the party-goers' faces are shown changing into different animals'. In the following scene, Kesha is seen sitting on a chair with two men by her side. Jeffree Star then approaches Kesha. Kesha and Star engage in a choreographed dance battle; Star then shoots Kesha with a laser chain saw which she deflects with her bracelet, Kesha responds by shooting lasers out of her hands, killing Star. After the battle the party-goers crawl around Kesha and she is seen holding a gold cup with a blue foaming liquid spilling {{over the top of the}} glass. As Kesha gives the party goers a drink, their faces turn into different kinds of animals. The video ends with everyone dancing and turning into half animal humans, Kesha however, drinks from the cup and turns back into a leopard.|$|E

25|$|In Move Mode, {{the player}} may advance or {{backtrack}} (limited) to previous screens. In {{a similar fashion}} to Look Mode, triggers will appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> a corresponding directional button must be pressed to move to them, adding a turn to the count. Unlike Look Mode, however, triggers in Move Mode do not require Trigger Points, so one may move {{as much as one}} likes, assuming there is no turn limit. Once the player has exited the final screen of a stage, the player will be prompted to save and then {{move on to the next}} stage.|$|E
25|$|Hayashida {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} NES Remix should be completely authentic to its vintage roots. To this end, the compilation is based entirely on accurate emulation of the NES's hardware and on the original game software. This includes hardware glitches such as frame rate slowdown when too many characters are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> <b>and</b> software bugs. Hayashida stated that these were intricate parts of the original and directly affect the difficulty {{and so they were}} not changed. Hayashida also spoke similarly about the controls; even if they were not considered ideal, he understood that they had been conceived that way for a reason and so they were unaltered for NES Remix.|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with acute}} {{exacerbated}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (AECOPD) and concurrent depression suffer significant psychological stress and decreased quality of life. The {{aim of this}} study was to collate data, guidelines and recommendations from publications <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> management of depressive mood disorders in patients hospitalised with AECOPD. We systematically searched four databases for publications reporting screening or management of depression in patients hospitalised for AECOPD. The identification of articles was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Out of 1494 original articles screened, 35 met all inclusion criteria. These report a prevalence of depression in AECOPD ranging between 9. 5 % and 85. 6 %. Some studies report high postadmission mortality rates for depressive AECOPD patients, and higher readmission rates in depressive versus nondepressive AECOPD patients. Importantly, none of the 35 publications included suggestions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> <b>and</b> management of depression in AECOPD. Depression and AECOPD frequently co-occur, and this worsens outcomes. Yet we did not find recommendations on management, and few interventional studies. Patients hospitalised with AECOPD should be systematically <b>screened</b> for depression <b>and</b> treatment recommendations should be developed for these patients. Randomised studies on how to <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> treat depression in hospitalised AECOPD are necessary...|$|R

25|$|Many techniques, collectively called dithering, {{have been}} {{developed}} to approximate a wider range of colors with a small color palette by using pixels of two or more colors to approximate in-between colors. These techniques sacrifice spatial resolution to approximate deeper color resolution. While not part of the GIF specification, dithering can of course be used in images subsequently encoded as GIF images. This is often not an ideal solution for GIF images, both because the loss of spatial resolution typically makes an image look fuzzy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> <b>and</b> because the dithering patterns often interfere with the compressibility of the image data, working against GIF's main purpose.|$|E

Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too.
