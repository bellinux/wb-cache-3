Unfortunately, the relatively low mortality rate, large body size, wide range of species preyed upon, and success as a predator has resulted in the blue catfish being considered a problematic invasive species in Virginia. Since their introduction in Virginia waters in the 1970s, blue catfish populations have exploded.

The present stand had above-ground biomass of 154.8  Mg∙ha− 1 ∙yr− 1, and above-ground net primary production {{during the study period}} was estimated to be 17.2  Mg∙ha− 1 ∙yr− 1. Those values were lower to those of AGB (159  Mg∙ha− 1 ∙yr− 1) and AGNPP (27  Mg∙ha− 1 ∙yr− 1) for R. apiculata dominated mangrove forest at Southern Thailand (Christensen 1978). Our estimates of AGNPP (17.2  Mg∙ha− 1 ∙yr− 1) were near {{the high end of the}} range of values reported in mangrove forests at Florida, USA (8.1 – 26.1  Mg∙ha− 1 ∙yr− 1; Ross et al. 2001). The present value of NPP was higher than those reported for R. apiculata dominated forest at Matang mangrove forest, Malaysia (17.7  Mg∙ha− 1 ∙yr− 1; Putz and Chan 1986). The study area is located in the <b>oligohaline</b> zone of the Sundarbans mangrove forest and the area is flushed frequently by tides that may cause higher NPP of this mangroves. Similar findings were observed by Day et al. (1989), who reported that mangrove forest flushed frequently by tides and exposed to high nutrient concentrations have higher net primary production. There are three ecological zones in the Sundarbans such as <b>oligohaline,</b> mesohaline, and polyhaline zone based on the degree of salinity and floristic composition. The floristics composition of Sundarbans is defined by the distribution of three species: H. fomes, E. agallocha, and C. decandra. All three species occur throughout the Sundarbans but in different proportions depending on salinity. H. fomes is the characteristics of the <b>oligohaline</b> zone, E. agallocha of the mesohaline zone, and C. decandra of the polyhaline zone (Rahman and Islam 2015). Depending on the site of mangroves along the salinity gradient of an estuary and with distance inland from the shore, the properties of mangrove communities vary within an environmental setting (Chen and Twilley 1999). So in the present study, mangrove communities in the <b>oligohaline</b> zone may have higher productivity and turnover than other ecological zones of Sundarbans, Bangladesh.|$|E

40|$|The Imboassica lagoon, {{located in}} the Municipality of Macaé (RJ), is {{separated}} from the sea by a sand bar, and its surroundings are partially occupied by residential areas. This coastal lagoon has undergone environmental degradation due to sewage input and artificial sand bar openings. The temporal and spatial variation of environmental variables and zooplankton were studied monthly for four years. There were five artificial openings of the sand bar {{during the period of}} study, mostly in the rainy season. Besides osmotic changes, these events caused the drainage of the water of the lagoon into the sea, loss of total organic nitrogen, and an increase of total phosphorus. The zooplankton community of Imboassica lagoon included freshwater and marine taxa, holoplanktonic, meroplanktonic and nectobenthonic forms. Polychaeta, Bivalvia and Gastropoda larvae, and the taxa of Rotifera Hexarthra spp., Lecane bulla, Synchaeta bicornis, nauplii of Cyclopoida and Calanoida copepods were considered constant taxa. Distinct zooplankton assemblages were found during zooplankton spatial surveys in <b>oligohaline</b> and mesohaline conditions.

40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{removal from}} {{estuaries}} is driven {{in part by}} sedimentary microbial processes. The processes of denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) remove N from estuaries by producing di-nitrogen gas, and each can be coupled to N recycling pathways such as nitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Environmental conditions in estuaries influence sedimentary N cycling processes; therefore, seawater intrusion may affect the coupling of N cycling processes in the freshwater portions of estuaries. This study investigated the potential effects of seawater intrusion on these process couplings through a comparative modeling approach. We applied environ analysis, a form of ecological network analysis, to two N cycling mass-balance network models constructed at freshwater (<b>oligohaline)</b> and saltwater (polyhaline) sites in the Cape Fear River Estuary, North Carolina. We used a space-for-time substitution to predict the effects of seawater intrusion on the sedimentary N cycle. Further, we conducted an uncertainty analysis using linear inverse modeling to evaluate the effects of parameterization uncertainty on model results. Nitrification coupled to both denitrification and anammox was 2. 5 times greater in the <b>oligohaline</b> model, while DNRA coupled to anammox was 2. 7 times greater in the polyhaline model. However, {{the total amount of}} N 2 gas produced relative to the nitrogen inputs to each network was 4. 7 % and 4. 6 % at the <b>oligohaline</b> and polyhaline sites, respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Monthly {{samples of}} nutrients, {{phytoplankton}} and zooplankton {{were taken in}} the Columbia River estuary {{over a period of}} 16 months in order to determine distribution with season and salinity, and interrelationships between plankton and nutrients. Nitrate and phosphate levels in the river water entering the estuary are high in the winter and show depletion during the summer. Silicate levels are high in the river water at all seasons. Nitrate and phosphate levels are high in the entering ocean water during summer offshore upwelling. The nutrient levels in the estuary generally show a linear relationship with salinity, resulting from the levels of nutrients in the entering river and ocean water. Superimposed upon this linear relationship is a tendency for the nutrients to be enriched in the bottom waters of {{the central part of the}} estuary. The estuary phytoplankton are primarily composed of freshwater forms, and probably represent a downstream extension of the river flora. Regression analysis of phytoplankton levels vs. light, nutrients, and river flow indicates that light probably limits phytoplankton abundance on most dates. The zooplankton of the estuary are composed of three groups, preferring fresh, <b>oligohaline,</b> and polyhaline waters respectively. Regression analysis indicates a strong correlation between abundance of the freshwater group and river temperature. The factors controlling the abundance of the <b>oligohaline</b> and polyhaline groups are less obvious. The <b>oligohaline</b> group, principally Eurytemora affinis, reaches the greatest population density (100, 000 /m³ or more).

40|$|In the {{framework}} of rehabilitation efforts to enhance the ecological value of closed-off estuaries, we studied the effects of restoring a tidal movement and seawater incursion on soil nitrogen conversion rates and vegetation response of semi-natural and agricultural grasslands in an outdoor mesocosm experiment. Intact soil monoliths including vegetation were collected in June 2004 on two locations {{on the shores of}} the Haringvliet lagoon in the south-western part of the Netherlands, which used to be a well-developed estuary before closure in 1970. For more than 1 year, soil monoliths were continuously subjected to a full-factorial combination of tidal treatment [stagnant/tidal (0. 20 m amplitude) ] and water type [(freshwater, <b>oligohaline</b> (salinity = 3) ]. Soil, soil moisture and water nitrogen concentrations were monitored for a year, as well as vegetation response and nitrogen conversion rates in the soil. As expected, nitrogen mineralization rates were enhanced by the tidal treatment in comparison with the stagnant treatment. Denitrification rates however, were much less affected by tide and were even lower in the tidal treatments after 3 months in the agricultural grassland soils, implying that in general, soils were more oxic in the tidal treatments. <b>Oligohaline</b> treatments had virtually no effect on soil nitrogen conversion rates compared to freshwater treatments. Vegetation performance, however, was lower under saline conditions, especially in the semi-natural grassland. No further significant differences in response to the tidal and <b>oligohaline</b> treatments were found between the two soils although they differed strongly in soil characteristics. We conclude that if the rehabilitation measures in the former Haringvliet estuary are carried out as planned, drastic changes in soil nitrogen processes and vegetation composition will not occur. ...|$|E

Geometric-morphometric analysis was carried out on different populations of C. torosa collected in <b>oligohaline</b> (Massaciuccoli marsh, Tuscany, and Lake Trasimeno, Umbria) and hyperhaline waterbodies (Trapani-Paceco salt pans, Sicily). The results indicate that the species displays two morphotypes: a dominant one, characterized by a straight ventral border; and a morphotype with a sigmoidal profile ventral border. This latter morphotype seems to be related to higher salinity: the <b>oligohaline</b> waters are characterized only by C. torosa individuals with straight ventral outline, while the hyperhaline environments are marked by the occurrence of 17. 6 % of sigmoidal individuals. Furthermore, the sigmoidal ventral border is more emphasized in males than in females...|$|E
40|$|Studies on the occurrence, {{abundance}} {{and diversity of}} free living nematodes of the Bonny and New Calabar estuaries were carried out to provide baseline information {{on the nature of}} petroleum activity. Twenty-one sample stations were established to cover the polyhaline, mesohaline and <b>oligohaline</b> ecological zones of both rivers. At each station, sediments were collected and processed for the extraction of nematodes. The nematodes extracted were identified, counted and the data obtained were computed using diversity indices to determine and compare nematode abundance/density, species similarity, evenness and faunal dominance within and between ecological zone in each river system and between the two river systems as well as the petroleum and municipal waste input stations. A total of 36 species were encountered in the Bonny estuary, 31 in the New Calabar estuary and 29 species in the human activity input areas. The highest densities were obtained in the <b>oligohaline</b> zone of both rivers and the human activity input areas. Dominant species in both Bonny and New Calabar rivers were Anoplostoma sp; Teristus pertenuis, Belbolla sp.; Geomonhystera and Oncholaimus paralangrunensis, Sabatieria lonispinosasp, Terschellingia longicudate, Sabatieria vugaris, Sphaerolaimus albidum an...|$|E
40|$|Physocypria kliei Schäfer, 1934, {{was found}} in water-bodies near Maarssen and Simonshaven (The Netherlands). It can be {{characterized}} as an <b>oligohaline</b> species occurring all the year round. The species is new to the Dutch fauna. It is concluded that Physocypria perlata Rome, 1943, is a junior synonym of P. kliei Schäfer, 1934. Potamocypris unicaudata Schäfer, was collected in a water-body near Rockanje (The Netherlands). Evidence is provided that Potamocypris vanoyei De Vos, 1946, is a junior synonym of P. unicaudata Schäfer, 1943...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} value of flounder from shore angling around Ireland was assessed. Flounder catches from shore angling tournaments around Ireland {{were related to}} domestic and overseas shore angling expenditure {{in order to determine}} an {{economic value}} for the species. Temporal trends in flounder angling catches, and specimen (trophy) flounder reports were also investigated. Flounder was found to be the most caught shore angling species in competitions around Ireland constituting roughly one third of the shore angling competition catch although this did vary by area. The total value of flounder from shore angling tourism was estimated to be of the order of € 8. 4 million. No significant temporal trends in flounder angling catches and specimen reports were found. Thus there is no evidence from the current study for any decline in flounder stocks. The population dynamics of 0 -group flounder during the early benthic stage was investigated at estuarine sites in Galway Bay, west of Ireland. Information was analysed from the March to June sampling period over five years (2002 to 2006). Spatial and temporal variations in settlement and population length structure were analysed between beach and river habitats and sites. Settlement of flounder began from late March to early May of each year, most commonly in April. Peak settlement was usually in April or early May. Settlement was recorded earlier than elsewhere, although most commonly was similar to {{the southern part of the}} UK and northern France. Settlement was generally later in tidal rivers than on sandy beaches. Abundance of 0 -group flounder in Galway Bay did not exhibit significant inter -annual variability. 0 -group flounder were observed in dense aggregations of up to 105 m' 2, which were patchy in distribution. Highest densities of 0 -group flounder were recorded in limnetic and <b>oligohaline</b> areas as compared with the lower densities in polyhaline and to a lesser extent mesohaline areas. Measurements to of salinity allowed the classification of beaches, and tidal river sections near the mouth, into a salinity based scheme for length comparisons. Beaches were classified as polyhaline,the lower section of rivers as mesohaline, and the middle and upper sections as <b>oligohaline.</b> Over the March to June sampling period 0 -group flounder utilised different sections at different length ranges and were significantly larger in more upstream sections. During initial settlement in April, 0 -group flounder of 8 - 10 mm (standard length, SL) were present in abundance on polyhaline sandy beaches. By about 10 mm (SL), flounder were present in all polyhaline, mesohaline and (<b>oligohaline)</b> sections. 0 -group flounder became absent or in insignificant numbers in polyhaline and mesohaline sections in a matter of weeks after first appearance. From April to June, 0 -group flounder of 12 - 30 mm (SL) were found in more upstream locations in the <b>oligohaline</b> sections. About one month (May or June) after initial settlement, 0 -group flounder became absent from the <b>oligohaline</b> sections. Concurrently, flounder start to reappear in mesohaline and polyhaline areas at approximately 30 mm (SL) in June. The results indicate 0 -group flounder in the early benthic stage are associated with low salinity areas, but as they grow, this association diminishes. Results strongly suggest that migration of 0 -group flounder between habitats takes place during the early benthic phase...|$|E
