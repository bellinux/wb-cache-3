5|$|Two main {{aspects of}} adult {{attachment}} have been studied. The organization {{and stability of}} the mental working models that underlie the attachment styles is explored by social psychologists interested in romantic attachment. Developmental psychologists interested in the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment generally explore how attachment functions in relationship dynamics and impacts relationship outcomes. The organization of mental working models is more stable while the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment fluctuates more. Some authors have suggested that adults do not hold a single set of working models. Instead, on one level they {{have a set of}} rules and assumptions about attachment relationships in general. <b>On</b> <b>another</b> <b>level</b> they hold information about specific relationships or relationship events. Information at different levels need not be consistent. Individuals can therefore hold different internal working models for different relationships.|$|E

Despite disagreeing with some analysis, Bird felt it gratifying for his work to be considered on many different levels, which was his intention: [...] "The fact that it was written about in the op/ed section of The New York Times several times was really gratifying to me.

40|$|The {{title of}} Zbigniew Herbert’s poem “Fra Angelico: Martyrdom of Saints Cosmas and Damian” {{suggests}} that the poem is a typical ekphrasis. Such descriptiveness seems to be confirmed by the author's segmentation of the text (and {{at the same time}} of the presented world) into the left side, background and {{the right side of the}} picture. Such division is characteristic for verbal description of a picture as a work of painting and is used by historians of art. But by reading more attentively it reveals that Herbert's poem should be treated not only as a description of the picture, but its interpretation. Herbert refers not only to the picture, but to external information (hagiology). Division of the world in the poem causes stratification <b>on</b> <b>another</b> <b>levels</b> of the text such as narrators. While “left side of the picture” is presented from external perspective indefinite in details, “right side of the picture” deals with the presented world from the viewpoint of the characters from the described picture.

500|$|For {{the ancient}} Greeks, {{the tale of}} the Trojan War and the {{surrounding}} events appeared in its most definitive form in the Epic Cycle of eight narrative poems from the archaic period in Greece (750 BC – 480 BC). The story of Troilus is {{one of a number of}} incidents that helped provide structure to a narrative that extended over several decades and 77 books from the beginning of the Cypria to the end of the Telegony. The character's death early in the war and the prophecies surrounding him demonstrated that all Trojan efforts to defend their home would be in vain. His symbolic significance is evidenced by linguistic analysis of his Greek name [...] "Troilos". It can be interpreted as an elision of the names of Tros and Ilos, the legendary founders of Troy, as a diminutive or pet name [...] "little Tros" [...] or as an elision of Troië (Troy) and lyo (to destroy). These multiple possibilities emphasise the link between the fates of Troilus and of the city where he lived. <b>On</b> <b>another</b> <b>level,</b> Troilus' fate can also be seen as foreshadowing the subsequent deaths of his murderer Achilles, and of his nephew Astyanax and sister Polyxena, who, like Troilus, die at the altar in at least some versions of their stories.|$|E
