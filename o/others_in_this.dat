5|$|A {{variety of}} psychoactive {{drugs and alcohol}} have notable effects on consciousness. These range from a simple dulling of {{awareness}} produced by sedatives, to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants, cannabis, empathogensâ€“entactogens such as MDMA ("Ecstasy"), or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics. LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, Dimethyltryptamine, and <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> group can produce major distortions of perception, including hallucinations; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality. The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol, but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role.|$|E

5|$|Alkan's {{attachment}} {{to the music of}} his predecessors is demonstrated throughout his career, from his arrangements for keyboard of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony (1838), and of the minuet of Mozart's 40th Symphony (1844), through the sets Souvenirs des concerts du Conservatoire (1847 and 1861) and the set Souvenirs de musique de chambre (1862), which include transcriptions of music by Mozart, Beethoven, J. S. Bach, Haydn, Gluck, and <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> context should be mentioned Alkan's extensive cadenza for Beethoven's 3rd Piano Concerto (1860), which includes quotes from the finale of Beethoven's 5th Symphony. Alkan's transcriptions, together with original music of Bach, Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Couperin and Rameau, were frequently played during the series of Petits Concerts given by Alkan at Erard.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{leadership}} style {{was to give}} contradictory orders to subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently. Hitler typically did not issue written orders, but gave them orally at meetings or in phone conversations; he also had Bormann convey orders. Bormann used his position to control {{the flow of information}} and access to Hitler, earning him enemies, including Himmler.|$|E

Possessed of a fine intellect, and extremely fond of the game, he is apt to lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike. Chess is his very life and soul, the one thing for which he lives.|$|E

25|$|Social {{psychology}} is the {{scientific study of}} how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> definition, scientific refers to the empirical method of investigation. The terms thoughts, feelings, and behaviors include all psychological variables that are measurable in a human being. The statement that others' presence may be imagined or implied suggests that we are prone to social influence even when no other people are present, such as when watching television, or following internalized cultural norms.|$|E

25|$|The moral {{influence}} {{doctrine of}} atonement is typically taught within a paradigm of salvation {{which focuses on}} positive moral change as the core of Christianity. God is depicted as concerned with whether a person's inner character is good or evil (where 'good' refers primarily to unselfish love toward <b>others).</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> system, God works to bring positive moral change within the hearts of individuals and to transform societies to become more loving. He acted to bring such change through {{the teachings of the}} Old Testament Law, the Jewish Prophets, and the teaching and example of Jesus. The inspiring power of Jesus' martyrdom and subsequent resurrection are also often cited as catalysts for moral change. Many holding a moral influence view also believe that the Holy Spirit works to help people toward moral change. In the moral influence view, it is generally believed that God will judge the souls of the dead in the afterlife based on their moral character, attested to by their conduct (a belief that many Evangelical Protestants reject). Most advocates of the view strongly endorse the concept of Free Will, insisting that humans are responsible for their actions and capable of change. However, some advocates (e.g. Augustine) have held the view that humans are incapable of moral change themselves and require God to radically alter their psychology through the Holy Spirit's working in them. The moral influence model of atonement is usually associated with a minimal doctrine of Original Sin or complete denial thereof, although not always (again Augustine is a notable exception).|$|E
25|$|Johanna Beyer {{was born}} in Leipzig, Germany, but very {{little is known about}} her life prior to her move to the United States in 1923. She sang for three years at the Leipziger Singakademie and {{graduated}} from the Deutscher Konservatorien and Musikseminare, having studied piano, harmony, theory, counterpoint, singing, and dancing. Colleagues in New York recalled that her pianism and musicianship were excellent and that her musical training seemed traditional and solid. She spent 1911â€“1914 in America, though nothing is known of her activities during those years. Returning to the U.S. in 1923 (according to the biographical notes she provided in a Composers' Forum concert program), she studied at the Mannes College of Music, receiving two degrees by 1928. She taught piano to support herself, and may have taught at Greenwich House Music School, but struggled to make ends meet, resorting at times to WPA work and Ladies Home Aid. In the late 1920s or early thirties she began studying with Ruth Crawford, Charles Seeger, and Dane Rudhyar and in 1934 took Henry Cowell's percussion class at the New School for Social Research. Her musical life during these years was intertwined with Seeger, Crawford, Cowell, John Cage, and <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> modernist circle such as Jessie Baetz, a now-forgotten composer and painter who studied with Beyer. Her most intimate friendship was with Cowell; surviving correspondence reveals a tumultuous, and possibly romantic, relationship between the two composers. Beyer acted as Cowell's informal agent and secretary from 1936 to 1941 on a voluntary basis (only receiving partial compensation in 1941).|$|E
500|$|Lemoine {{has been}} {{described}} by Nathan Altshiller Court as a co-founder (along with Henri Brocard and Joseph Neuberg) of modern triangle geometry, a term used by William Gallatly, among <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> context, [...] "modern" [...] is used to refer to geometry developed from the late 18th century onward. Such geometry relies on the abstraction of figures in the plane rather than analytic methods used earlier involving specific angle measures and distances. The geometry focuses on topics such as collinearity, concurrency, and concyclicity, as they do not involve the measures listed previously.|$|E

He received training initially from William Woodman Graham and then William Cecil Slingsby. According to an article in The Times, he was well regarded by his peers as [...] "a climber of great skill and daring". He was a very experienced alpine climber, and often climbed without guides, ascending Aiguille du Dru, Fletschhorn, Ober Gabelhorn amongst <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> fashion. With guides, he climbed {{some of the toughest}} mountains in the Alps, such as the Matterhorn and the Eiger.|$|E
500|$|Bonass {{completed}} the 1939â€“40 season with QPR in the wartime league, which although not regarded as competitive was certainly taken seriously: against Chelsea in December, he was stretchered {{off with a}} suspected broken leg, victim of a tough tackle [...] "like many <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> pacy, no-quarter struggle" [...] where the [...] "war of words between rival fan factions on the terrace reminded [...] of the Glasgow Rangersâ€“Celtic match". He played some 30 times for QPR thereafter, and guested {{for a number of}} clubs including Aldershot, Brentford, Chesterfield, Fulham, Luton Town, Southampton, Watford and York. Bonass served with the Metropolitan Police as a War Reserve Constable for four years, and apart from his war-related duties, played for their football team, scored as the Police Professionals beat the Police Amateurs 5â€“2 in September 1942, and also represented the national police team.|$|E
500|$|Their {{bodies were}} left in a heap, and by 9:00a.m. a {{considerable}} crowd had gathered. The corpses were pelted with vegetables, spat at, urinated on, shot at and kicked; Mussolini's face was disfigured by beatings. An American eye witness described the crowd as [...] "sinister, depraved, out of control". After a while, the bodies were hoisted up on to the metal girder framework of a half-built Standard Oil service station, and hung upside down on meat hooks. This mode of hanging {{had been used in}} northern Italy since medieval times to stress the [...] "infamy" [...] of the hanged. However, the reason given by those involved in hanging Mussolini and the <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way was to protect the bodies from the mob. Movie footage of what happened appears to confirm that to be the case.|$|E
