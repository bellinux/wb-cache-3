40|$|Abstract: The {{quality of}} the printed screen {{elements}} made by the application of two types of offset rubber blankets (ORB) have been investigated in this work. The force in the contact zone between the <b>offset</b> <b>cylinder</b> (ORB) and the printing cylinder (printing substrate) is decisive for making the prints. With the different structure of ORB the different deformation zone is created, which results in forming the different sizes of the screen elements. The printing substrate has also influence, {{and because of that}} 5 characteristic papers (fine art paper gloss, fine art paper mat, offset paper, calendered offset paper and recycled paper) have been analyzed. The results show that on the tested printing substrates, the both ORBs form the greatest dot gains in the following order: offset paper, recycled paper, calendered offset paper, fine art paper mat and fine art paper gloss.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation was}} conducted to analyze the unsteady flow and heat transfer characteristics for cylinders of square cross-section in a laminar channel flow The study focuses on differences in the drag, lift, and heat transfer coefficients for a single and tandem pair of cylinders due to the proximity to a channel wall. Both uniform and parabolic inlet velocity profiles are considered. The cases are calculated for a fixed cylinder Reynolds number of 500 and a Prandtl number of 0. 7. The heated cylinder is held at a constant temperature and is initially centered in the channel. The eddy promoter has side dimensions one-half of the downstream cylinder and is placed at a fixed distance upstream. The upstream cylinder is either located midway between {{the top and bottom}} cylinder surfaces (inline) or it is centered on the top or bottom edges (offset) of the primary cylinder. The results show that the cylinder Nusselt number decreases for both single and inline tandem cylinders as they approach the wall in a parabolic flow but remain almost constant in a uniform flow. This is primarily due to the reduced mean velocity near the wall. The time-averaged drag coefficient decreases for both single and inline tandem cylinders as they approach the wall in a parabolic flow. The presence of the upstream cylinder significantly reduces the drag on the downstream cylinder when compared to that of a single cylinder but has little affect on the cylinder lift. Additionally, the overall cylinder Nusselt number increases slightly in both uniform and parabolic flows. The Strouhal number is much larger for an inline tandem pair than for a single cylinder for all cylinder positions. The amplitude of eddy-shedding induced oscillations is significantly dampened as the cylinder(s) approach the channel wall. Offsetting the eddy promoter causes a significant reduction in the heat transfer and a large increase in the drag coefficient for the channel-centered cylinder when compared to the inline tandem case. The <b>offset</b> <b>cylinder</b> is found to slightly reduce the overall heat transfer and increase the drag from the downstream heated cylinder for the other two cross-stream locations. The study also indicates that placing the eddy promoter in higher velocity fluid increases the Strouhal number of the downstream cylinder...|$|E

40|$|Partial {{differential}} equations (PDEs) are often dependent on input quantities which are inherently uncertain. To quantify this uncertainty, these PDEs must be solved {{over a large}} ensemble of parameters. Even for a single realization this can a computationally intensive process. In the case of flows governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, an efficient method has been devised for computing an ensemble of solutions. To further reduce the computational cost of this method, an ensemble proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method was recently proposed. The main contribution of this work is the introduction of POD spatial filtering for ensemble-POD methods. The POD spatial filter makes possible {{the construction of the}} Leray ensemble-POD model, which is a regularized reduced order model for the numerical simulation of convection-dominated flows. The Leray ensemble-POD model employs the POD spatial filter to smooth (regularize) the convection term in the Navier-Stokes equations and greatly diminishes the numerical inaccuracies produced by the ensemble-POD method in the numerical simulation of convection-dominated flows. Specifically, for the numerical simulation of a convection-dominated two-dimensional flow between two <b>offset</b> <b>cylinders,</b> we show that the Leray ensemble-POD method yields accurate results, whereas the ensemble-POD is highly inaccurate. The second contribution of this work is a new numerical discretization of the variable viscosity ensemble algorithm in which the average viscosity is replaced with the maximum viscosity. It is shown that this new numerical discretization is significantly more stable than those in current use. Furthermore, error estimates for the novel Leray ensemble-POD algorithm with this new numerical discretization are also proven. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1709. 0642...|$|R

He later developed the induction swirl chamber, which was an attempt to achieve orderly air motion in a diesel engine, the swirl being initiated by inclined ports and accentuated by forcing the air into a small cylindrical volume. Finally he developed the compression swirl chamber for diesel engines. This design embodied intense swirl with a reasonable rate of pressure rise and good fuel consumption.|$|R
