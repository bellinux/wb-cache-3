40|$|The coolest dwarf stars {{targeted}} by the Kepler Mission constitute a relatively small but scientifically valuable subset of the Kepler target stars, and provide a high-fidelity, nearby sample <b>of</b> <b>transiting</b> planetary systems. Using archival Kepler data spanning the entire primary mission, we perform a uniform analysis to extract, confirm, and characterize the transit signals discovered by the Kepler pipeline toward M-type dwarf stars. We recover {{all but two of}} the signals reported in a recent listing from the Exoplanet Archive resulting in 163 planet candidates associated with a sample of 104 low-mass stars. We fitted the observed light curves to transit models using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and we have made the posterior samples publicly available to facilitate further studies. We fitted empirical transit times to individual transit signals with significantly non-linear ephemerides for accurate recovery <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> parameters and precise measuring <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> timing variations. We also provide the physical parameters for the stellar sample, including new measurements of stellar rotation, allowing the conversion <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> parameters into planet radii and orbital parameters.
