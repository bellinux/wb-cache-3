5|$|It is also {{possible}} to change one's coat of arms, with or without adopting or appending a new surname, by Royal Licence, {{that is to say}} a licence {{in the form of a}} warrant from the Crown directed to the Kings of Arms instructing them to exemplify the transferred arms or a version of them to the licensee in his or her new name. Royal Licences are issued on the advice of Garter King of Arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a testamentary injunction (a requirement in a will) <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reason to wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms. The Royal Licence is of no effect until and unless the exemplification is issued and recorded in the College. Royal Licences are gazetted and make a deed poll unnecessary.|$|E

25|$|Great Calva {{is mainly}} covered in heather, which makes walking {{relatively}} difficult. From the north west an {{approach can be}} made from Orthwaite, following a bridleway between Great Cockup and Little Calva to the col between Knott and the summit. Alternatively Great Calva can be climbed up the pathless south ridge from Skiddaw Forest, which creates a number of options for starting points. The Skiddaw House supply road follows Dash Beck up from Peter House Farm, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> track runs alongside the Caldew from the road at Mosedale. Access is also possible up the Glenderaterra valley from the south, starting either from the Gale Road car park or the vicinity of Threlkeld.|$|E
25|$|Mary {{takes the}} {{children}} to visit their father at the bank where he works ("Precision and Order"). There, George is busy dealing with possible investment clients: firstly, an ambitious man named Herr Von Hussler with an elaborate money-making scheme, and then a middle-class man named John Northbrook with a simple factory project. George is furious when Mary turns up with the children, but an innocent question asked by Jane (What's more important, a good man <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea?) makes him realise how much his values have changed ("A Man Has Dreams") since he was an idealistic young man. He then decides to accept Northbrook's project and rejects Von Hussler's, but unfortunately things take {{a turn for the}} worse afterwards.|$|E
25|$|At Kansas, after a 5th-place {{run in the}} spring, Earnhardt {{was looking}} to repeat this feat to start off the {{contender}} with a solid finish to help his chances to extend his run for the championship. After leading 45 laps in the same car he used to win both Pocono races earlier in the season, a cut right front tire resulted in a 39th-place finish. That finish caused him to fall to 11th place in points, 25 points behind 8th place. He came to Charlotte needing a win <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> finish. He led early but around lap 133, his shifter broke due to a vibration (a similar problem had befallen Jimmie Johnson at Michigan in August). He had to make multiple pit stops {{to fix the problem}} and never recovered, ending up 20th. He fell to last in the Chase standings, 26 points behind 8th.|$|E

500|$|... —is a {{point of}} entry into the psychoanalytical {{interpretation}} of the poem, in which the limestone landscape is a suitable backdrop for narcissism. The poem's [...] "band of rivals" [...] cavorting about the [...] "steep stone s" [...] exists in an aesthetic and spiritual torpor—unable to [...] "conceive a god whose temper-tantrums are moral/ And not to be pacified by a clever line/ <b>Or</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> lay…". Lacking inner conflict, these youth will never [...] "separate" [...] or produce {{a new kind of}} art. Compared to the trait's earlier literary treatments, [...] "Limestone"'s narcissism [...] "bodes not so much the promise of a powerful aesthetic, but an artistic culture which, while it seduces, is ultimately stultified by the gratification of its own desire".|$|E
500|$|... "Once the {{manuscript}} was complete, he [...] sat opposite Richards {{and read the}} entire book aloud to him ... He {{turned out to be}} a really natural editor. He cut according to the sound of it." [...] Rebecca Dana of The Daily Beast said of Life that it [...] "covers all the bases: sex, drugs, guitar riffs, the size of Mick Jagger’s endowment. It also digs down into softer spots, including Richards’ tumultuous relationship with Anita Pallenberg and the death of their son. The book, which already seems to have earned a place in the admittedly small canon of genuinely great rock lit, is dishy but not lurid, technical but not wonky. Richards’ voice, filtered through Fox’s brain, is so relentlessly endearing, no less a critic than Maureen Dowd has declared the prince of darkness a [...] "consummate gentleman." [...] Time's Richard Corliss writes [...] "Confessional autobiographies, unless they're by William Boroughs, tend to have inspirational endings: salvation through strong will <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> woman. Life has both." ...|$|E
500|$|Described by Riley as the album's [...] "most {{derivative}} cut", [...] "Got to Get You into My Life" [...] {{was influenced}} by the Motown Sound and written by McCartney after he had seen Stevie Wonder perform at the Scotch of St James nightclub in February. The horn players on the track included members of Georgie Fame's group, the Blue Flames. To capture the desired sound, microphones were placed in the bells of the brass instruments, and the signals were heavily limited. A month later, a tape copy of these horn parts was superimposed with a slight delay, thereby doubling the presence of the brass contributions. Rodriguez terms the completed track [...] "an R shouter". Although cast {{in the form of a}} love song, McCartney described the lyric as [...] "an ode to pot, like someone else might write an ode to chocolate <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> claret". The initial version of the song, as issued on Anthology 2, featured acoustic backing and organ, and a harmonised refrain of [...] "I need your love", which was replaced by Harrison's guitar break on the more uptempo remake.|$|E

500|$|A {{review for}} the album in The Independent noted {{that none of}} the songs [...] "can really hold a candle to Cave's [...] "Red Right Hand" [...] in {{capturing}} the show's sense of fatalistic futility", adding that there seemed to be [...] "a shared soul thing" [...] between Cave and Carter. Ted Cox, writing for the Daily Herald, described the album as [...] "a who's who of modern rock". Cox rated the album three stars out of five, noting that [...] "most of the material hits the fair-to-middling quality level of a neglected album cut <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> B-side"; adding, however, that the album's overall [...] "atmosphere of paranoia and alienation" [...] helped to tie it together. Writing for The Buffalo News, Anthony [...] rated the album four stars out of five, calling it [...] "a strange, delightful trip". [...] felt that [...] "Star Me Kitten" [...] was the album's best song, and that Danzig's [...] "Deep" [...] was its [...] "weakest cut". Writing for the Los Angeles Daily News, Fred Shuster felt that compared to other television tie-ins that [...] "aren't worth the aluminum they're recorded on", Songs in the Key of X [...] "is a rare exception because of the unusual quality and rarity of the tracks". Shuster rated the album three stars out of five, describing it as [...] "more imaginative than the show that inspired it".|$|E

2500|$|Pubs can {{be traced}} back to Roman taverns, through the Anglo-Saxon alehouse to the {{development}} of the tied house system in the 19th century. In 1393, King Richard II of England introduced legislation that pubs had to display a sign outdoors to make them easily visible for passing ale tasters, who would assess the quality of ale sold. Most pubs focus on offering beers, ales and similar drinks. As well, pubs often sell wines, spirits, and soft drinks, meals and snacks. The owner, tenant or manager (licensee) is known as the pub landlord or publican. Referred to as their [...] "local" [...] by regulars, pubs are typically chosen for their proximity to home or work, the availability of a particular beer or ale <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> selection, good food, a social atmosphere, the presence of friends and acquaintances, and the availability of recreational activities such as a darts team, a skittles team, and a pool or snooker table.
