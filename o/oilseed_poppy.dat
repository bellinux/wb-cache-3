40|$|For {{the past}} few years, a rising {{interest}} {{for the production of}} oil poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) on bigger areas in the Republic of Croatia has been noticed. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine seed yield and other agronomic traits of foreign cultivars and domestic populations of <b>oilseed</b> <b>poppy</b> in the environmental conditions of northwestern Croatia and select the best varieties for this area, considering the obtained results. The research was conducted in 2013 and 2015 at the experimental field of University of Zagreb, Faculty of Agriculture. The research involved four foreign cultivars (Opal, Lazur, Major, and Matis) and two domestic populations of <b>oilseed</b> <b>poppy</b> named after locations where they had been collected: Gornji Bogićevci (IND 00042) and Beli Manastir (IND 00043). According to the obtained results, it can be concluded that the examined cultivars and domestic populations of <b>oilseed</b> <b>poppy</b> differed significantly in seed yield, capsule number per plant, seed weight per capsule, seed weight per plant, and thousand seed weight only in the year of 2013. On average, cultivars/populations with the highest yield were Opal (847 kg/ha), Beli Manastir (834 kg/ha), and Major (816 kg/ha). Oil content in poppy seed ranged from 42. 5 % (Lazur) to 46. 3 % (Opal). Linoleic, oleic, and palmitic acids prevailed in examined cultivars and populations...|$|E
40|$|Downy mildew {{is a major}} {{limiting}} factor of <b>oilseed</b> <b>poppy</b> production in Tasmania. However, little knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease currently exists. The objectives of this project were to taxonomically identify the downy mildew pathogen, characterise the spatiotemporal development of epidemics, analyse the effect of weather variables on epidemic development, and identify the means of overwintering by the pathogen. Phylogenetic analysis of the ribosomal DNA region, including the internal transcribed spacer regions and the 5. 8 S gene, indicated the downy mildew pathogen is Peronospora cristata, not P. arborescens as previously reported. Conidium dimensions were unable {{to distinguish between the}} two species. Under favourable disease conditions epidemics can develop rapidly, with disease incidence increasing in a field trial from 0. 2...|$|E
50|$|Zábřeh is {{situated}} in fertile lowland which is used for agricultural production. Maize, wheat, <b>oilseed</b> rape, <b>poppy</b> and fodder plant are grown. A tall silo {{is situated}} in outskirt {{of the town and}} helps create town panorama.|$|R
50|$|In the Mohelnická Brázda lowlands, corn, barley, wheat, <b>oilseed</b> rape, <b>poppy,</b> sugar beet, alfalfa and flax {{are grown}} and cattle and {{broilers}} raised. The Hanušovická vrchovina hills have a timber industry. Although the Nealko factory is now abandoned, the Agrega factory {{is still in}} operation.|$|R
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, France, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from Bayer CropScience to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance prothioconazole in rape seed, linseed, poppy seed and mustard seed. In order to accommodate the intended uses of prothioconazole, France proposed to raise the existing MRLs from the value of 0. 1 mg/kg for rape seed and 0. 05 mg/kg for the other three oilseeds to 0. 15 mg/kg for these four oilseeds. France drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 0. 15 mg/kg for the proposed uses on <b>oilseed</b> rape, linseed, <b>poppy</b> and mustard. However a data gap is identified for the stability of residues included in the plant risk assessment residue definition (other than prothioconazole-desthio) in plant samples, stored frozen, to be demonstrated. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of prothioconazole in plant matrices at the validated LOQ of 0. 02 mg/kg for prothioconazole-desthio as sum of isomers. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed use of prothioconazole on <b>oilseed</b> rape, linseed, <b>poppy</b> and mustard will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|R
