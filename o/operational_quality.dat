Hypotheses derived from the key features of TQM and IT presented by previous authors are tested using Structural Equation Modelling through field research on a sample of 234 manufacturing companies in Spain. The {{results indicate that the}} sampled firms make considerable use of IT to support their TQM initiatives and that overall such efforts generate significant positive gains on <b>operational</b> and <b>quality</b> performance, the few exceptions to this are noted and discussed. The limitations of the survey include: single key informant, only cross-sectional and limited performance measures. A longitudinal/cross-cultural study including other performance measures (e. g. percentage defect rates, number of customer claims) would add to further understanding. A survey of IT in support of TQM initiatives on <b>operational</b> and <b>quality</b> performance in manufacturing suggests how firms and other organisations should focus their IT investments to improve performance. Both Information Technology and Total Quality Management have had, and continue to have, a significant impact on most organizations.

50|$|Centralized {{traffic control}} (CTC) {{is a form}} of railway {{signalling}} that originated in North America. CTC consolidates train routing decisions that were previously carried out by local signal operators or the train crews themselves. The system consists of a centralized train dispatcher's office that controls railroad interlockings and traffic flows in portions of the rail system designated as CTC territory. One hallmark of CTC is a control panel with a graphical depiction of the railroad. On this panel the dispatcher can keep track of trains' locations across the territory that the dispatcher controls. Larger railroads may have multiple dispatcher's offices and even multiple dispatchers for each operating division. These offices are usually located near the busiest yards or stations, and their <b>operational</b> <b>qualities</b> can be compared to air traffic towers.|$|R

50|$|For example, a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) {{system can}} now {{forecast}} observations with confidence intervals and their <b>operational</b> <b>quality</b> control {{can thus be}} improved. A sudden increase of uncertainty in predicting observations would indicate that important observations were missing (observability problem) or an unpredictable change of weather is taking place (controllability problem). Remote sensing and imaging from satellites may partly be based on forecast information. Controlling stability of such feedback between the forecast and satellite data calls for the theory of optimal Kalman filtering. No suboptimal solution would do a proper job as public safety is usually at stake.|$|E
50|$|Flight <b>operational</b> <b>quality</b> {{assurance}} (FOQA, pronounced PHO-QU-A), {{also known}} as flight data monitoring (FDM) or flight data analysis, is a method of capturing, analyzing and/or visualizing the data generated by an aircraft moving through the air from one point to another.

Several airlines and air forces have initiated FOQA programs to collect, store and analyze recorded flight data. The goal is to improve the organization or unit's overall safety, increase maintenance effectiveness and reduce operational costs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In {{electrified}} railway {{traction power}} supply systems, the <b>operational</b> <b>qualities</b> and reliabilities {{of the main}} traction transformer loop is higher, but ones of bus output units is comparatively low. The traction transformer loop still works when output loops are in failure, and the output loop interrupts working when the main transformer is in failure, and only has residual life when restoring working, the connection formation between them is in series. Traditional reliability analysis methods let their lifetime follow exponential distribution, and reliability is investigated based on the minimal path sets, which lead to a comparatively rough result, consequently. According to Markov theory, in this paper the main loop life is considered as mixed Erlang distribution with order n, and the output unit life follows generic distribution. As compared with conventional series systems, the acquired results are proved to be reliable and sound...|$|R

50|$|A {{quick access}} {{recorder}} (QAR) is an airborne flight recorder {{designed to provide}} quick and easy access to raw flight data, through means such as USB or cellular network connections and/or the use of standard flash memory cards. QARs are typically used by airlines to improve flight safety and operational efficiency, usually in the scope of their flight <b>operational</b> <b>quality</b> assurance plans. Like the aircraft's flight data recorder (FDR), a QAR receives its inputs from the Flight Data Acquisition Unit (FDAU), recording over 2000 flight parameters. The QAR is also able to sample data at much higher rates than the FDR and, in some cases, {{for longer periods of}} time. Unlike the FDR, the QAR usually is not required by a national Civil Aviation Authority on commercial flights and is not designed to survive an accident. Despite this, some QARs have survived accidents and provided valuable information beyond what was recorded by the FDR.|$|E

The customer chooses the airline and the airport that best meets their needs. This dissertation is composed of two essays. The first essay examines the airline choice decision and the second essay investigates the airport choice decision. In the first essay {{the focus is the}} impact of airline <b>operational</b> <b>quality</b> among airline characteristics. This may include nonstop flight services, service frequency, on-time operations, etc. These factors contribute to the overall utility of airline service. Improvements in <b>operational</b> <b>quality</b> can lead to increases in reliability and convenience. As a result customers will choose airlines that offer higher levels of <b>operational</b> <b>quality.</b> Particularly, some customers are more sensitive to <b>operational</b> <b>quality</b> based on their unique characteristics and tend to have stronger preference for the airlines that provide higher levels of <b>operational</b> <b>quality.</b> This essay examines the following three issues; (1) the impact of <b>operational</b> <b>quality</b> on customer's {{choice of a}}irline, (2) the moderating role of operations exposure (i. e., the extent to which customers are exposed to service operations) on customer choice, and (3) the moderating effect of customer characteristics on <b>operational</b> <b>quality.</b> The second essay looks at the impact of Low Cost Carrier (LCC) presence at airports and focuses on the following issues: (1) the impact of LCC presence on a route (after controlling for the impact of fares and service frequencies) on a customer's choice of airport, (2) the moderating effect of customer demographic characteristics on airline characteristics, and (3) the moderating role of the customer's geographical location on a customer's choice of airport.

30|$|The {{utilization}} of molecular beacon (MB) biosensor probes to detect nucleic acid targets has received enormous interest within the scientific community. This interest has been {{stimulated by the}} <b>operational</b> <b>qualities</b> of MB-based probes {{with respect to their}} unique sensitivity and specificity. The design of MB biosensors entails not only optimizing the sequence of the loop to hybridize with the nucleic acid target or optimization of the length of the stem to tune the sensitivity but also the selection of the appropriate fluorophore reporter to generate the signal transduction read-out upon hybridization of the probe with the target sequence. Traditional organic fluorescent dyes are mostly used for signal reporting in MB assays but their optical properties in comparison to semiconductor fluorescent quantum dot (Qdot) nanocrystals are at a disadvantage. This review highlights the progress made in exploiting Qdot as fluorophore reporters in MB-based assays with the aim of instigating further development in the field of Qdot-MB technology. The development reported to date indicates that unparalleled fluorescence signal reporting in MB-based assays can be achieved using well-constructed Qdot fluorophores.|$|R
