40|$|Thymic rudiments from chick {{and mouse}} embryos have been cultured in {{diffusion}} chambers on the chick chorioallantois. In this situation their supply of blood-borne stem cells is cut off. Although rudiments from older embryos become fully lymphoid under these circumstances, primordia from early embryos fail to develop any lymphoid cells. Early chick rudiments will however develop completely {{if they are}} grafted directly to the chorioallantois where they receive a vascular supply. It is concluded that stem cells first enter the chick thymic anlage at between 6 and 7 days' incubation and the mouse thymic rudiment between 10 and 11 days' gestation. During the following few days of development there is a rapid inflow of stem cells to the rudiments. Since {{it is likely that}} stem cells, once they have entered the thymic primordium, are capable of only limited proliferation, it must be concluded that an inflow of stem cells continues once full lymphopoiesis has begun, although perhaps at a reduced rate. Finally, the importance of the interaction between stem cell and <b>organ</b> <b>rudiment</b> to normal thymic development is discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of thymic anomalies...|$|E
40|$|The {{cell cycle}} is {{strictly}} regulated during development and its regulation {{is essential for}} organ formation and developmental timing. Here we observed the pattern of DNA replication in swimming larvae of an ascidian, Ciona intestinalis. Usually, Ciona swimming larvae obtain competence for metamorphosis at about 4 - 5 h after hatching, and these competent larvae initiate metamorphosis soon after they adhere to substrate with their papillae. In these larvae, three major tissues (epidermis, endoderm and mesenchyme) showed extensive DNA replication with distinct pattern and timing, suggesting tissue-specific cell cycle regulation. However, DNA replication did not continue in aged larvae which kept swimming for several days, suggesting that the cell cycle is arrested in these larvae {{at a certain time}} to prevent further growth of adult <b>organ</b> <b>rudiments</b> until the initiation of metamorphosis. Inhibition of the cell cycle by aphidicolin during the larval stage affects only the speed of metamorphosis, and not the formation of adult <b>organ</b> <b>rudiments</b> or the timing of the initiation of metamorphosis. However, after the completion of tail resorption, DNA replication is necessary for further metamorphic events. Our data showed that DNA synthesis in the larval trunk is not directly associated with the organization of adult organs, but it contributes to the speed of metamorphosis after settlement...|$|R
40|$|Bmi- 1 is a {{protooncogene}} of the polycomb {{group that}} has important functions in self-renewal of adult stem cells and maintenance of anterior identity along the embryonic body axis. Despite these important functions, surprisingly {{little is known about}} its distribution pattern in the embryo. Here, we have isolated the chick homologue of bmi- 1 and examined its expression pattern from gastrulation through neurulation and establishment of <b>organ</b> <b>rudiments.</b> During gastrulation, bmi- 1 transcripts were expressed in the epiblast cells adjacent to the primitive streak. During early nervous system development, robust expression was observed in the open neural plate and later in the dorsal neural tube and much of the brain. Bmi- 1 expression was also present in the developing heart primordia and the sensory placodes. The data show that bmi- 1 is present in, but not restricted to, tissue containing multipotent precursor cells...|$|R
40|$|The sub-renal capsule graft {{site for}} in vivo growth and {{development}} of developing organs {{can be used to}} great advantage in the "rescue" of <b>organ</b> <b>rudiments</b> from "embryonic" or "birth" lethal mutant mice, which permits examination of the full impact of gene knockout in all phases of development from morphogenesis to adult functional differentiation. Another use of the sub-renal capsule graft site is the examination of normal and "chemically perturbed" development of human fetal organs. Tissue recombinants composed of various types of epithelium and mesenchyme, when grafted under the renal capsule undergo normal development and in 3 - 4 weeks achieve full adult functional cytodifferentiation. The investigator can control many of the developmental parameters of the graft such as endocrine status of the host and treatment of the host with a variety of biologically active agents to assess their effects on development and differentiation...|$|R
40|$|The {{retinoblastoma}} (Rb) {{gene product}} is a prototypic tumor suppressor. Mice lacking the Rb gene are not viable {{and die in}} utero at � 13 days of gestation. In this study, we have rescued Rb �/ � prostates by grafting pelvic <b>organ</b> <b>rudiments</b> from Rb �/ � mouse embryos under the renal capsule of adult male nude mouse hosts. Grafts of embryonic pelvic organs developed into functional prostatic tissue. Some of the prostatic tissue generated was further used to construct chimeric prostatic tissue recombinants by combining wild-type rat urogenital mesenchyme (rUGM) with Rb �/ � and Rb �/ � prostatic epithelium (PRE). The tissue recombinants were grown as subcapsular renal grafts and treated {{from the time of}} grafting with Silastic capsules containing 25 mg of testosterone plus 2. 5 mg of estradiol. During 5 – 8 weeks of hormone treatment, rUGM�Rb �/ � PRE tissue recombinants developed prostatic hyperplasia, whereas PRE in rUGM�Rb �/ � PRE tissue recombinants developed hyperplasia, atypica...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{vertebrate}} heart arises during gastrulation as cardiac precursors converge {{from the}} lateral plate mesoderm territories toward the embryonic midline and extend rostrally to form bilateral heart fields. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate {{functions of the}} nervous and immune systems; however, their roles in gastrulation remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that the zebrafish homologs of the Agtrl 1 b receptor and its ligand, Apelin, implicated in physiology and angiogenesis, control heart field formation. Zebrafish gastrulae express agtrl 1 b in the lateral plate mesoderm, while apelin expression is confined to the midline. Reduced or excess Agtrl 1 b or Apelin function caused deficiency of cardiac precursors and, subsequently, the heart. In Apelin-deficient gastrulae, the cardiac precursors converged inefficiently to the heart fields and showed ectopic distribution, whereas cardiac precursors overexpressing Apelin exhibited abnormal morphology and rostral migration. Our results implicate GPCR signaling in movements of discrete cell populations that establish <b>organ</b> <b>rudiments</b> during vertebrate gastrulation...|$|R
40|$|Since adult {{epithelial}} {{cells from the}} urogenital tract are unquestionably capable of expressing alternative phenotypes when induced by embryonic or neonatal mesenchymes, we examined the effect of certain inductive mesenchymes on the differentiation and growth of the DT by growing 0. 5 mm 3 fragments of the DT in association with mesenchyme from various embryonic and neonatal rat <b>organ</b> <b>rudiments.</b> Whereas grafts of DT alone contained narrow ducts lined with undifferentiated {{epithelial cells}} characteristic of the DT, the DT derived epithelium of UGM + DT, SVM + DT or BUG-M + DT recombinations differentiated into tall columnar secretory epithelial cells organized into large cystic ducts. These mesenchyme induced changes in histodifferentiation of the DT cells were coupled {{to a loss of}} tumorigenesis since the mesenchyme induced highly differentiated DT cells never formed tumours. This reduction in growth rate and loss in tumorigenesis of mesenchyme induced DT epithelial cells was accompanied by a reduction in [3 H]thymidine labelling index and the expression of a secretory phenotype as demonstrated by both light microscopy and electron microscopy. These findings demonstrate that the connective tissue environment can have profound regulative effects on both normal and neoplastic epithelial cells. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Removing the {{function}} of a specific gene from a developing organ, by making a ‘knockout’ mouse, is a powerful method for analyzing the molecular pathways that control organogenesis. The technique is expensive, though, {{in terms of time}} and money, and complex strategies for producing conditional knockouts are needed for genes that are essential for early development of the embryo, for which an unconditional knockout would be lethal before the organ of interest begins to form. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) offer a method of knocking down the expression of specific genes with no need for genomic manipulation. Almost as soon as they had been discovered, siRNAs began to be used to explore the molecular biology of mammalian cells in conventional, two-dimensional culture. They have now also been applied successfully, by several groups, to knock down specific genes in various <b>organ</b> <b>rudiments</b> developing in <b>organ</b> culture. This article reviews the basic technique of siRNA-mediated gene knockdown and how it is being applied to organ culture. It also reviews some of the current problems and challenges in the field, {{and the ways in which}} these problems are likely to be overcome...|$|R
40|$|Owing to its {{optical clarity}} and rapid rate of development, the {{zebrafish}} embryo {{is an ideal}} model system for studying the cellular mechanics of organogenesis. Unfortunately, extended time-lapse recordings of zebrafish embryos are often disrupted by the extension and straightening of the embryonic axis, as well as movement artifacts associated with developing musculature. In addition, the embryo's massive yolk cell often prevents optical access to tissues of interest. To circumvent these imaging problems, we have developed a procedure to deflate and mechanically remove the yolk cell. A "paralyzing" agent, AMP-PNP (a membrane-impermeant nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP), is first injected into the embryo's contractile yolk cell. The yolk cell is then removed using sharpened tungsten needles. Deyolked embryos, or <b>organ</b> <b>rudiments</b> explanted from them, are then immobilized on a microscope coverslip using a thin plasma clot. This plasma clot immobilization allows novel mountings of the explants so that ventral, lateral, and even cross-sectional fields of views are possible using high numerical aperture objectives. We show that isolated head rudiments undergo normal morphogenesis and gene expression for at least 1 day after being explanted into organotypic culture. These procedures {{can be used to}} study the cellular mechanics of organogenesis in "deyolked" embryos, as well as in tissues explanted from green fluorescent protein transgenic animals. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports the}} effects of the {{nucleoside}} analogs dideoxyinosine (DDI) and 3 '-azido- 3 'deoxythymidine (AZT) on mammalian embryonic development. When administered to pregnant mice (at concentrations ranging from 10 to 300 mg/kg/day), through all or part of gestation, AZT and DDI did not result in any visible effect on mouse embryos nor did they cause any obvious malformation or defect at birth or during postnatal growth. Similarly, when embryonic or fetal mouse or human cells (from brain, limb buds, or different <b>organ</b> <b>rudiments)</b> were exposed to AZT or DDI in vitro, cytotoxicity was observed only in the mM range, with AZT showing slightly higher cytotoxicity and brain cells appearing slightly more sensitive to both nucleosides. However, even in cultures treated with very high concentrations of AZT or DDI, the {{reduction in the number of}} terminally differentiated skeletal myotubes, cardiocytes, neurons, and chondrocytes was similar to the reduction in the total number of cells, indicating that AZT and DDI did not selectively inhibit differentiation of any of the above-mentioned cell types. Finally, preimplantation mouse embryos (at the 2 -cell or 4 -cell stage), treated in vitro with micromolar concentrations of AZT, were arrested at the 4 -cell stage. DDI or other nucleoside analogs tested did not have this effect...|$|R
40|$|The chief {{results of}} the studies here {{reported}} have been (1) the correlation between growth {{as a whole and}} the differentiation of gross form (primary redistributions or simple evolution), and (2) the correlation between internal integration or concentration and the differentiation of chemical form (secondary redistributions or compound evolution). With the latter are also associated the catabolic rate and the latent period or reaction time after implantation in plasma as demonstrated in tissue culture experiments. Moreover, {{it has been shown that}} these two chief developmental processes occur at different rates, and that they undergo their greatest changes in rate at different periods of embryonic life. Corresponding with Robertson's growth acceleration periods there may be three cycles or rhythms of which the embryonic phase is the first, each composed of a period of growth followed by a period of differentiation. This conception is somewhat analogous to Roux's notion of dividing the life span into two chief periods (1) embryonic for the growth of <b>organ</b> <b>rudiments</b> and (2) post-embryonic, characterized by functional development. The first period of total growth and form differentiation seems to cover the time when the main, but bare, outline or scaffolding of the organism is laid down. The second period, correlated as it is with catabolism (function), corresponds, not in time but as a phenomenon, with Roux's period of functional form development...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in developing organisms is well established. Proteoglycans and interstitial collagens are required for the growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation of epithelial organs {{and the distribution of}} these molecules has been described. However, much less is known about other ECM macromolecules in developing epithelial organs. We used confocal microscopy to examine the distribution of laminin, heparan sulfate (BM- 1) proteoglycan, fibronectin, and collagen types I, IV, and V, in mouse embryonic salivary glands. <b>Organ</b> <b>rudiments</b> were isolated from gestational day 13 mouse embryos and cultured for 24, 48, or 72 hours. Whole mounts were stained by indirect immunofluorescence and then examined using a Zeiss Laser Scan Microscope. We found that each ECM component examined had a distinct distribution and that the distribution of some molecules varied with culture time. Laminin was mainly restricted to the basement membrane. BM- 1 proteoglycan was concentrated in the basement membrane and also formed a fine network throughout the mesenchyme. Type IV collagen was mainly located in the basement membrane of the epithelium, but it was also present throughout the mesenchyme. Type V collagen was distributed throughout the mesenchyme at 24 hours, but at 48 hours was principally located in the basement membrane. Type I collagen was distributed throughout the mesenchyme at all culture times, and accumulated in the clefts and particularly at the epithelial-mesenchymal interface as time in culture increased. Fibronectin was observed throughout the mesenchyme at all times...|$|R
40|$|Stem or {{progenitor}} {{cells are}} a promising potential alternative source of pancreatic islets for transplantation {{in the treatment}} of juvenile-onset diabetes. However, to derive islets from such cells, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms of normal pancreatic development. Previous work in our laboratory has shown that, contrary to previous thinking, pancreatic mesenchyme when combined with pancreatic epithelium can contribute cells to islets. However, the signals and role of individual tissues involved in this mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition (MET) have yet to be elucidated. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether MET can occur in the absence of pancreatic epithelium. Chick and quail eggs were incubated for 4 days and the dorsal pancreatic buds and stomach rudiments were microdissected. Mesenchyme and epithelium of the <b>organ</b> <b>rudiments</b> were separated after collagenase treatment. Separated pancreatic mesenchyme were cultured alone and in combination with stomach (nonpancreatic). After 7 days of culture, the specimens were analysed using immunohistochemistry for quail-specific nucleolar antigen (QCPN), insulin, and islet precursor cell marker (ISL- 1). Pancreatic mesenchyme when cultured in the absence of epithelium did not differentiate into islets, but differentiated into fibroblast-like cells. When pancreatic mesenchyme were cultured in combination with stomach epithelium, there was no evidence of mesenchymally derived islets. We have demonstrated that pancreatic mesenchyme require pancreatic epithelium to differentiate into islet cells. These findings further increase our understanding of normal pancreatic islet development and may help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of MET in islet development...|$|R
40|$|N-CAM, {{the neural}} cell-adhesion molecule, has {{previously}} {{been found to be}} expressed during several epochs of development and function, first as an early marker in embryo-genesis, later during organogenesis, and finally in adult life. L-CAM, the liver cell-adhesion molecule, has now been localized in embryonic and adult tissues of the chicken by fluorescent antibody techniques. In the early embryonic epoch, L-CAM and N-CAM appeared in epiblastic and hypoblastic tissues. L-CAM was distributed thereafter across all three germ layers. By the onset of neurulation, however, L-CAM disappeared in the region of the neural plate and N-CAM increased in amount in that region. L-CAM appeared strongly on all budding endodermal structures (liver, pancreas, lung, thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, and bursa of Fabricius) whereas N-CAM appeared most strongly in the neural plate, neural tube, and in cardiac mesoderm but was not found in endodermal derivatives. In placodes, both L-CAM and N-CAM were present until the formation of definitive neural structures, at which time L-CAM disappeared. In kidney precursors, the two CAMs followed a complex reciprocal pattern of appearance and disappearance. For the most part, however, the distributions of the two molecules did not overlap during organogenesis. Like N-CAM, L-CAM persisted in a distinctive pattern of expression in adult tissues. During embryonic development, the two different CAMs were distributed on tissues derived from {{more than two-thirds of the}} early embryonic surface. Interpretation of maps summarizing CAM distributions over a defined developmental epoch suggested a key role for both L-CAM and N-CAM in embryonic induction. Consistent with this interpretation and with the fact that the continuity of germ layers is lost when <b>organ</b> <b>rudiments</b> are formed, neither of the CAMs was limited in distribution to a single germ layer. The regions of the early epochal maps that lacked both L-CAM and N-CAM comprised some portions of the splanchnopleure and somatopleure. Certain adult tissues that derive from this lateral plate mesoderm such as smooth muscle also lacked L-CAM and N-CAM. Such observations suggest that at least one more CAM may exist in these and similarly derived tissues...|$|R

50|$|Teredo navalis is a protandrous hermaphrodite. All {{individuals}} {{start their}} adult life as males, becoming mature {{when they are}} a few centimetres long, releasing sperm into the sea. In warmer areas they change into females about 8 to 10 weeks after settling, but this change may take six months before it occurs in colder climates. The eggs are fertilised when sperm gets sucked into the burrow of a female through the inhalant siphon. More than a million larvae at a time are brooded in the gill chamber, after which they are released into the sea as veliger larvae. By this time they have developed a velum, a ciliated locomotory and feeding <b>organ,</b> and the <b>rudiments</b> of a straight-hinged shell. They eat phytoplankton and disperse with the current for 2 to 3 weeks. During further larval stages they develop siphons and gills.|$|R
40|$|AbstractInduction and {{branching}} morphogenesis of {{the prostate}} are dependent on androgens, which act via the mesenchyme to induce prostatic epithelial development. One mechanism by which the mesenchyme may regulate the epithelium is through secreted growth factors such as FGF- 10. We have examined the male reproductive tract of FGF- 10 −/− mice, and at birth, most of the male secondary sex organs were absent or atrophic, including the prostate, seminal vesicle, bulbourethral gland, and caudal ductus deferens. Rudimentary prostatic buds were occasionally observed in the prostatic anlagen, the urogenital sinus (UGS) of FGF- 10 −/− mice. FGF- 10 −/− testes produced sufficient androgens to induce prostatic development in control UGS <b>organ</b> cultures. Prostatic <b>rudiments</b> from FGF- 10 −/− mice transplanted into intact male hosts grew very little, but showed some signs of prostatic differentiation. In cultures of UGS, the FGF- 10 null phenotype was partially reversed {{by the addition of}} FGF- 10 and testosterone, resulting in the formation of prostatic buds. FGF- 10 alone did not stimulate prostatic bud formation in control or FGF- 10 −/− UGS. Thus, FGF- 10 appears to act as a growth factor which is required for development {{of the prostate}} and several other accessory sex organs...|$|R
60|$|Rudiments {{of muscles}} not {{normally}} found in man occur in many aberrant human individuals. Some people possess {{the power of}} moving their scalps and wagging their ears like dogs and monkeys; others can twitch the skin of their bodies, as horses do when worried by flies. Mr. Woolner, the sculptor, pointed out to Darwin a certain little projecting point or knob on {{the margin of the}} ear, observed by him in the course of modelling, which comparison shows to be the last folded remnant or rudiment of the once erect and pointed monkey-like ear-tip. The nictitating membrane, or third eyelid, once more, which in birds can be drawn so rapidly across the ball of the eye, and which gives the familiar glazed or murky appearance, is fairly well developed in the ornithorhynchus and the kangaroo, as well as in a few higher mammals, like the walrus; but in man, as in the monkey group, it survives only under the degenerate form of a practically useless rudiment, the semilunar fold. Man differs from the other Primates in his apparently hairless condition; but the hair, though short and downy, still remains on close inspection, and in some races, such as the Ainos of Japan, forms a shaggy coat like an orang's or a gibbon's. A few long rough hairs sometimes project from the short smooth down of the eyebrows; and these peculiar bristles, occasional only in the human species, are habitual in the chimpanzee and in many baboons. Internal <b>organs</b> show similar <b>rudiments,</b> of less enthralling interest, it must be candidly confessed, to the unscientific outside intelligence. Even the bony skeleton contributes its share of confirmatory evidence; for in the lower monkeys and in many other mammals a certain main trunk nerve passes through a special perforation in the shoulder-blade, and this perforation, though now almost obsolete, sometimes recurs in man, in which case the nerve in question invariably passes through it, as in the inferior monkeys. What is still more remarkable {{is the fact that the}} perforation occurs far more frequently (in proportion) among the skeletons of very ancient races than among those of our own time. One chief cause why in this and other cases ancient races often present structures resembling those of the lower animals seems to be that they stand nearer in the long line of descent to their remote animal-like progenitors.|$|R
