5|$|The House of Seljuk was {{a branch}} of the Kınık Oğuz Turks who resided <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> of the Muslim world, in the Yabgu Khaganate of the Oğuz confederacy, {{to the north of the}} Caspian and Aral Seas, in the 9th century. In the 10th century, the Seljuks started {{migrating}} from their ancestral homeland into Persia, which became the administrative core of the Great Seljuk Empire, after its foundation by Tughril.|$|E
5|$|The {{availability}} of new cheap land {{led to a}} rapid increase in {{the population of the}} territory, with thousands of new settlers entering the region every year. Large settlements began to spring up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> of the territory around the Great Lakes, the Ohio River, the Wabash River, and the Mississippi River. Much of the interior, though, remained inhabited by the Native American tribes and was left unsettled.|$|E

5|$|The land {{cleared of}} trees largely became pasture. From the 1880s, {{clearing}} {{of land for}} dairy farming increased, especially in the areas around Tahakopa and the Owaka River valley. Considerable sheep and dairy farming continues on the cleared hills <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> of the region, and this accounts {{for much of the}} Catlins' income. A rural polytechnic specialising in agricultural science (Telford Rural Polytechnic) is located south of Balclutha close to the northeastern edge of the Catlins.|$|E
5|$|Adam Mickiewicz {{was born}} on 24 December 1798, either at his {{paternal}} uncle's estate in Zaosie (now Zavosse) near Navahrudak (in Polish, Nowogródek) or in Navahrudak itself {{in what was then}} part of the Russian Empire and is now Belarus. The region was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> of Lithuania proper and {{had been part of the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania until the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1795). Its upper class, including Mickiewicz's family, were either Polish or Polonized. The poet's father, Mikołaj Mickiewicz, a lawyer, was a member of the Polish nobility (szlachta) and bore the hereditary Poraj coat-of-arms; Adam's mother was Barbara Mickiewicz, née Majewska. Adam was the second-born son in the family.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 30 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is whitish cream, whitish costally and suffused brown dorsally and postmedially. The hindwings are cream tinged brownish and brownish <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>peripheries.</b>|$|R

5|$|Impala feed on {{soft and}} nutritious grasses such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall grasses, such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are {{typically}} avoided. Impala <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> of the herds {{are generally more}} vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% {{of the day in}} the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our political and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> of mainstream dialogue in political theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E
5|$|The E-Group {{consists}} {{of a number of}} structures around a small plaza. These include a pyramid at the west side, a long structure on the east side supporting an upper platform and two smaller structures on the north and south sides. The E-Group was first built in the Late Preclassic Period, it was lightly occupied during the Early Classic and was then expanded with the addition of two structures in the Late Classic. By this time major activity at El Chal had been transferred to the area around the acropolis, leaving the once central E-Group <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{success and}} {{expansion}} of Islam brought it into contact with different cultures, societies and traditions, {{such as those of}} Byzantines and Persians. With such contact, new problems emerged for Islamic law to tackle. Moreover, there was a significant distance between Medina, the Islamic capital, and the Muslims <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> on the Islamic state. Thus far off jurists had to find novel Islamic solutions without the close supervision of the hub of Islamic law (back in Medina). During the Umayyad dynasty, the concept of qiyas was abused by the rulers. The Abbasids, who succeeded the Umayyads defined it more strictly, in an attempt to apply it more consistently.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 13 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is yellowish cream with indistinct brownish yellow suffusion and fine brownish strigulation (fine streaks). The markings are brown. The hindwings are cream, but brownish grey <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>peripheries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 19 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is cream orange, sprinkled and strigulated (finely streaked) with rust brown, but yellowish terminally. The hindwings are grey cream, but paler basally and much darker <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>peripheries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 13-15 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is pale creamy ochreous, {{mixed with}} brownish {{at the base}} and dorsum.

5|$|These radars {{have been}} {{installed}} at six different radar stations {{and as of}} 2012 are operational at three – Balkhash, Mishelevka and Olenegorsk. The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty required that early warning radars were located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> of national territory and faced outwards. This caused problems when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 {{as many of the}} radar stations were now in newly independent states. The first station to close was Skrunda, in newly independent Latvia. A 1994 agreement between Russia and Latvia agreed that the two Dnepr radars there would stop working in 1998, and would be fully demolished by 2000.|$|E
5|$|At his new forward {{command post}} at Ben Cat, General Dũng {{prepared}} {{plans for the}} final battle. He encircled Saigon with four North Vietnamese corps and the hastily assembled 232nd Tactical Force, a total of 19 divisions plus supporting artillery and armored units, approximately 130,000 men. His plan was to avoid intensive street fighting within the city itself by first tying down outlying South Vietnamese forces in their defensive positions and then launching five spearheads through them into the city, each of which had a specific target: the Independence Palace, the Joint General Staff headquarters, the national Police headquarters, Tan Son Nhut Air Base, and the Special Capital Zone headquarters. The attacks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> began on 26 April and the main attack on the city center began the following day.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{employ a}} number of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most species are polygynous, where males mate with multiple females. Male pipistrelle, noctule and vampire bats may claim and defend resources that attract females, such as roost sites, and mate with those females. Males that are unable to claim a site are forced to live <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> where they have less reproductive success. Promiscuity, where both sexes mate with multiple partners, exists in species like the Mexican free-tailed bat and the little brown bat. Nevertheless, there {{does appear to be}} bias towards certain males among females in these bats. In a few species, such as the yellow-winged bat and spectral bat, adult males and females form monogamous pairs. Lek mating, where males aggregate and compete for female choice though display, is rare in bats but notably occurs in the highly sexually dimorphic hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus).|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 21 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is grey with whitish grey suffusions and diffuse grey strigulation (fine streaks). The markings are grey with black marks. The hindwings are whitish grey with brownish admixture <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>peripheries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 11 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is white with some refractive scales. The dots {{are black and}} grey and the other markings are black. The hindwings are whitish grey to the middle, but brownish grey <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>peripheries.</b>|$|R
5|$|Byzantium {{used the}} peace to focus its energy on wars against the Abbasid Caliphate in the East, where {{a series of}} campaigns under generals John Kourkouas and Nikephoros Phokas greatly {{expanded}} imperial territory. At the same time, military reforms created a much more effective and offensively-oriented army. The Byzantines did not neglect the Balkans, working steadily to improve their contacts with the peoples {{of central and eastern}} Europe, subtly altering {{the balance of power in}} the peninsula. Their Crimean outpost of Cherson maintained trade with the Pechenegs and the emerging power of the Kievan Rus'; Byzantine missionaries led the Christianization of the Magyars; and the Slavic princes of the western Balkans came to once again acknowledge the suzerainty of the Empire, particularly after Caslav Klonimirovic ended Bulgarian control over Serbia. These relationships <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> of the Bulgarian Empire were an important asset for Byzantine diplomacy: instigating attacks against Bulgaria by the Pechenegs and the Khazars was a time-honoured method of applying pressure on the Bulgarians.|$|E
5|$|Cucumber {{focuses on}} the life of the middle-aged Henry Best (Vincent Franklin) and the fallout from a {{disastrous}} date with his boyfriend of nine years, and is accompanied with Banana, an E4 anthology series featuring younger characters across the LGBT spectrum <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> of the Cucumber narrative, and Tofu, an online documentary series available on 4oD discussing modern sex, sexuality and issues arisen during the show with the cast and public. The three names reference a urological scale categorising the male erection by hardness from tofu to cucumber, and are used to symbolise differences in sexual attitudes and behaviour between the two generations. Although Cucumber was designed as a self-contained serial focusing {{on the life of}} one man, Davies envisioned Banana as open-ended with the potential to continue after its sister series finished.|$|E
5|$|Development for Firewatch {{began with}} a single {{painting}} by Moss. Jane Ng, lead environmental artist at Campo Santo, was tasked with translating Moss' work into 3D environments while maintaining his stylized artistic vision. Moss, who had previously been known primarily for his graphic design work, had joined Vanaman and Rodkin to found Campo Santo after spending many years working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> of game development. In creating the painting, Moss emulated National Park Service posters from the New Deal era in both color palette and iconography. The development team went on a camping trip to Yosemite National Park for inspiration for the game, where they visited a lookout tower built with the same design as its video game counterpart. Further inspiration for the game came from Vanaman and Anderson's experiences growing up in rural Wyoming.|$|E
