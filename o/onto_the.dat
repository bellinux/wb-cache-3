50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ontos,</b> officially <b>the</b> Rifle, Multiple 106 mm, Self-propelled, M50, was a U.S. light armored tracked {{anti-tank}} vehicle {{developed in}} the 1950s, a fast tank killer for airborne forces.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ontos</b> crews liked <b>the</b> vehicle, and its commanders praised it. The {{relatively}} {{light weight}} of the M50s meant that they could also go where tanks got bogged down. <b>The</b> <b>Ontos,</b> with its lower ground pressure, could drag timbers up to the tanks to help get them unstuck. In one operation, <b>the</b> <b>Ontos</b> was <b>the</b> only tracked vehicle light enough to cross a pontoon bridge. In the Battle of Hue, Regimental Commander Colonel Stanley S. Hughes felt <b>the</b> <b>Ontos</b> was <b>the</b> most effective of all Marine supporting arms. Its mobility made it less vulnerable than tanks, which suffered heavy losses, while at ranges of 300 to 500 yd, its recoilless rifles could knock holes in or completely knock down walls. The appearance of an Ontos was sometimes {{enough to make the}} enemy break and run, and anecdotal accounts describe the enemy fleeing occupied buildings when an Ontos's spotting round entered a window. In Operation Desoto, the introduction of the large CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopter made possible moving a platoon 25 mi south of Quan Ngai City carrying Ontos in slings underneath the aircraft.|$|R

To the rear, the supravaginal cervix is covered by peritoneum, which runs <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> back of the vaginal wall and then turns upwards and <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> rectum, forming the recto-uterine pouch.

5|$|Maintenance problems. The chain driven {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} {{expensive}} to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> wheels caused oil to splash <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> boiler lagging in service. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash which provided a combustible material, {{and as a result}} of the heavy braking of the locomotives, sparks would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> wheels when stationary to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would invariably be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming into contact with the hot boiler, causing stress to the casing. Many photographs show an unmodified with 'buckled' (warped) casing, the result of a lagging fire.|$|E
