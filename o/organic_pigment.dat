500|$|Melanin is an <b>organic</b> <b>pigment</b> that {{produces}} {{most of the}} colour seen in mammals. Depending on how it is created, melanin comes in two colour ranges, eumelanin (producing dark browns and blacks) and pheomelanin (producing light reddish tans and blondes). The dark and light melanins have their influence either alone or in conjunction, making either plain or multi-coloured coats. [...] Sometimes, in a condition called agouti, they make multi-coloured individual hairs. [...] The production of melanin occurs in melanocytes in a complex process involving the enzyme tyrosinase. [...] Mammals have a gene that codes {{for the presence of}} tyrosinase in cells – called the TYR gene. [...] If this gene is altered or damaged, melanin cannot be reliably produced and the mammal becomes an albino. Besides the TYR gene, several other genes can cause albinism. [...] This is because other hormones and proteins are involved in melanin production, the presence of which is genetically determined. In mice, a total of 100 genes are known to affect albinism.|$|E

30|$|Whereas these {{techniques}} can produce successful results by using combined instruments {{with the added}} advancements of mobile equipment, it is acknowledged that identifying organic elements on cultural artefacts can be very challenging due to the chromophoric complexities found {{in the structure of}} some <b>organic</b> <b>pigments.</b> Despite the improvements and advancements in current and past analytical practice—which no doubt can be very valuable in particular circumstances—no technique is truly ideal to identify all <b>organic</b> <b>pigments</b> on manuscripts or other irreplaceable artefacts, due to the restrictions imposed by the need for micro-sampling of <b>organic</b> <b>pigments</b> and the limitations in detection associated with some of the scientific equipment used for this purpose [33, 34].|$|R
30|$|Modern <b>organic</b> <b>pigments</b> {{have the}} same {{conservation}} issues as other synthetic paint materials: they have been often chosen by artists {{on the basis of}} their colour hue and brightness, without sound knowledge of their durability and stability.

30|$|<b>Organic</b> <b>pigments</b> and dyes {{differ in}} their {{solubility}} in the medium {{in which they are}} incorporated: <b>organic</b> <b>pigments</b> are often obtained by forming insoluble structures (precipitating them as salts, or adsorbing them onto an inert substrate or even complexing them with suitable metal salts), while dyes are inherently soluble in the medium [3]. Lakes or lake <b>pigments</b> are <b>organic</b> <b>pigments</b> historically prepared as complexes following specific recipes, while the production of synthetic <b>organic</b> <b>pigments</b> started in the late 19 th century and has been flourishing {{since the beginning of the}} 20 th century. The distinction between natural and synthetic materials is complicated by the fact that since the beginning of the 19 th century, the manufacturers experimented with new ways to exploit natural dyes as pigments, by precipitating the natural extracts as salts in alkaline conditions. After the synthesis of alizarin (1868), several synthetic analogues of natural dyes were produced and used to obtain both lake <b>pigments</b> and <b>organic</b> <b>pigments.</b> At first, synthetic and natural pigments were often admixed, and after the 1930 s, synthetic pigments completely dominated the market [4].

40|$|The most {{important}} thermodynamic work performed by life {{today is the}} dissipation of the solar photon flux into heat through <b>organic</b> <b>pigments</b> in water. From this thermodynamic perspective, biological evolution is thus just the dispersal of <b>organic</b> <b>pigments</b> and water throughout Earth's surface, while adjusting the gases of Earth's atmosphere to allow the most intense part of the solar spectrum to penetrate the atmosphere and reach the surface to be intercepted by these pigments. The covalent bonding of atoms in <b>organic</b> <b>pigments</b> provides excited levels compatible with the energies of these photons. Internal conversion through vibrational relaxation to the ground state of these excited molecules when in water leads to rapid dissipation of the solar photons into heat, {{and this is the}} major source of entropy production on Earth. A non-linear irreversible thermodynamic analysis shows that the proliferation of <b>organic</b> <b>pigments</b> on Earth is a direct consequence of the pigments catalytic properties in dissipating the solar photon flux. A small part of the energy of the photon goes into the production of more <b>organic</b> <b>pigments</b> and supporting biomass, while most of the energy is dissipated and channeled into the hydrological cycle through the latent heat of vaporization of surface water. By dissipating the surface to atmosphere temperature gradient, the hydrological cycle further increases the entropy production of Earth. This thermodynamic perspective of solar photon dissipation by life has implications to the possibility of finding extra-terrestrial life in our solar system and the Universe.

It contains the oldest known cave art in Europe. Some researchers argue this might even be the oldest known example of artwork in the world and likely to be a product of Homo neanderthalensis. Hand stencils, claviforms (club shapes) and disks made by blowing paint onto the wall in El Castillo cave were found that date back at least 40,800 years, making them older than those of the Chauvet Cave in central France, which are dated to around 39,000 years BP.As traditional methods such as radiocarbon dating do not work where there is no <b>organic</b> <b>pigment,</b> a team of British, Spanish and Portuguese researchers led by Dr. Alistair Pike of the University of Bristol dated the formation of tiny stalactites on top of the paintings using the Uranium-thorium dating technique, thus obtaining a minimum age for the art.

5000|$|Michael Graetzel {{is one of}} {{developers}} of the so-called Graetzel cell operating {{on the principles of}} photosynthesis- the process similar to biochemical one and used by plants for light energy conversion into carbohydrates. The invention developed by the scientist since 1970th of past century represents profitable alternative for expensive and sophisticated technologies of photovoltaic arrays produced on the basis of silicon (in particular, the latter require expensive silicon of high purity). Compared to silicon-based batteries the Graetzel cells are rather simple and manufactured of low cost materials.First Graetzel cells discovered in 1991 were based upon porous layer of nanoparticles of titanium oxide covered with organic dye. Electrons from organic dye, able to efficiently adsorb solar radiation, migrate into conductive electrode made of titan dioxide and generate the electric flux.Commercial manufacturing of such cells was started just in 2009. At the initial stage, they possessed poor efficiency performances of 3-8% and poor stability due to available unstable liquid electrolyte and organic dye inside the cells. By 2012, the efficiency of cells has been increased by 11.9%.For the period over 20 years, the researchers headed by Graetzel have been working on the increase of efficiency of Graetzel solar cells and simplification of the technology of their production. In 2009, Japanese scientists managed to make a breakthrough and transfer from an <b>organic</b> <b>pigment</b> in the cells to hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite materials, and in 2012, they managed to replace liquid electrolyte by solid organic semiconductor. At that, a new class of devices, the so-called [...] "perovskite solar cells" [...] has emerged. At present, these devices are considered the most intensively studied materials in the world, and their efficiency currently exceeds 22%. Michael Graetzel's laboratories has set several world records with respect to the efficiency of perovskite solar batteries. Michael Graetzel is an ultimate leader in the field of materials for solar power industry and continues his works on development of photovoltaics all over the world; in particular, he actively cooperates with the researchers from Lomonosov Moscow State University in the area of perovskite photovoltaics.|$|E

30|$|While the {{chemical}} characterisation of historical and synthetic dyes {{has been the}} topic of several studies [11], there are few papers that describe the investigation of <b>organic</b> <b>pigments</b> from an analytical chemical point of view.
