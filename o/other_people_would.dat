5|$|The bookwheel, in {{its most}} {{commonly}} seen form, was invented by Italian military engineer Agostino Ramelli in 1588, presented {{as one of the}} 195 designs in Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli (The various and ingenious machines of Captain Agostino Ramelli). To ensure that the books remained at a constant angle, Ramelli incorporated an epicyclic gearing arrangement, a complex device that had only previously been used in astronomical clocks. Ramelli's design is unnecessarily elaborate, as he likely understood that gravity could have worked just as effectively (as it does with a Ferris wheel, invented centuries later), but the gearing system allowed him to display his mathematical prowess. While <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> go on to build bookwheels based on Ramelli's design, Ramelli did not in fact ever construct his own.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is {{it to say that}} he ought to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E
25|$|Yusuf Ziya Özcan, {{president}} of YÖK, announced in March 2008 military service duration would be equal for everyone, holding or not holding a degree would not matter. İlker Başbuğ, then {{president of}} Turkish Armed Forces, said that short term military service and reserve officers system would be abandoned. In this system he proposed, everybody would spend 12 or 15 months in conscription. Instead of reserve officers, officers would be contracted. In October 2010, instead of the system proposed before, shortening the duration of military service is proposed. In this proposition, short-term privates would spend 4 months and <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> spend 9 months in conscription. Conscripted 250000 people would be released early. TSK, refused this system claiming it would create a shortage of soldiers. However, some people argue conscripts are forced to work for officers' private needs. This includes driving, cooking, hairdressing and serving meals in officers' clubs, teaching to officers' children. Some of the conscripts are made officers' personal assistants. Number of these conscripts {{are estimated to be}} 231,000.|$|E

500|$|Moon's {{style of}} {{drumming}} was considered unique by his bandmates, although they sometimes found his unconventional playing frustrating; Entwistle {{noted that he}} tended to play faster or slower according to his mood. [...] "He wouldn't play across his kit," [...] he later added. [...] "He'd play zig-zag. That's why he had two sets of tom-toms. He'd move his arms forward like a skier." [...] Daltrey said that Moon [...] "just instinctively put drum rolls in places that <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> never have thought of putting them." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Neill {{was highly}} {{regarded}} for his style and entertainment values. Teammate Alan Davidson said [...] "once set {{he was the}} most exhilarating player you'd ever want to see—he was dynamite. He'd play attacking shots off balls <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> only think of defending. He had wonderful skill and technique. His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers—you can't really describe how good they were." [...] His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was [...] "one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say [...] "the art of batting, he reminded us, was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant" [...] Wisden opined that [...] "A high innings by O'Neill is a thing of masterful beauty. His stroking is delectable, immense in its power." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 1969, after George Harrison's song [...] "Something" [...] {{had been}} issued on the A-side {{of a single}} by the Beatles – {{the first time that}} one of his {{compositions}} had been given that honour – he remarked in an interview: [...] "There's a lot of songs like that in my head. I must get them down. Maybe even <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> like to sing them." [...] In the summer of 1970, [...] "Something" [...] gave Welsh singer Shirley Bassey her biggest UK hit in nine years, an achievement that led her to tell the press that she and Harrison could become a singer-and-songwriter pairing on the scale of Dionne Warwick and Burt Bacharach. Although he would later be dismissive of Bassey's version of [...] "Something", Harrison wrote a new song for her to record after reading these comments. Originally titled [...] "Whenever", it became [...] "When Every Song Is Sung" [...] and later [...] "I'll Still Love You".|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} was {{fraught with}} tension between band members, as McCartney annoyed others by insisting on a perfect performance. The track {{was the first}} Lennon was invited to work on following his car accident, but he hated it and declined to do so. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, Lennon said it was [...] "more of Paul's granny music" [...] and left the session. He {{spent the next two}} weeks with Ono and did not return to the studio until the backing track for [...] "Come Together" [...] was laid down on 21 July. Harrison was also tired of the song, adding [...] "we had to play {{it over and over again}} until Paul liked it. It was a real drag". Starr was more sympathetic to the song. [...] "It was granny music", he admitted, [...] "but we needed stuff like that on our album so <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> listen to it". Starr played the anvil sound in the chorus. This track also makes use of Harrison's Moog Synthesizer, played by McCartney.|$|E
500|$|Saadiq {{has said}} of his {{creative}} intentions with the follow-up, [...] "I’ve never shut my ears to anything, really. It’s not like I’m always looking for things, either, but I can’t close my ears to any music. Any guitar, any drums, any rhythm section— I’ve always been open to those things, {{trying to understand what}} makes them work in a song". He was influenced by early rock and roll artists such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, and has cited blues musician Howlin' Wolf as an influence on the album's sound, which he described as [...] "bluesy" [...] and [...] "harder" [...] than that of his previous album, with more aggressive tempos. In an interview for BULLETT Magazine, Saadiq explained his idea of the album's title, stating [...] "Stone Rollin basically symbolizes the action of throwing dice and taking chances with life. That's what I've done my whole career—taking chances with different styles of music and making choices that <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be afraid to take. Stone Rollin means I'm going all the way out there this time".|$|E
500|$|Babe {{was billed}} as [...] "a no-nonsense, bustling busybody with a big heart", who is also both shrewd and tough under her bubbly personality. Badland {{described}} Babe as [...] "quite a private person" [...] that would [...] "protect her family", who she was [...] "proud" [...] to be in contact with again. She said she that Babe enjoys keeping [...] "control in a social way" [...] and that despite having a [...] "front of being jolly", Babe could also get [...] "very angry" [...] and be [...] "ruthless". She said that Babe {{is the kind of}} person who, when someone crosses her, just does and says the things that <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> not think of doing or saying until it is too late, and though she had tried to find trigger points that influence Babe's vengefulness, had realised that Babe was [...] "wicked" [...] just [...] "for the joy of it". Rebecca Scroggs, who plays Tosh Mackintosh, described Babe as [...] "a lovely woman" [...] with a darker side that could make her the [...] "most fearsome Carter of all". Badland also revealed that she never wanted Babe to be [...] "modified into a more ordinary person" [...] because she [...] "relished" [...] the character.|$|E

500|$|Chen {{was born}} in Shanghai on October 8, 1981, and lived there until 2003. His parents were [...] "a middle-class family", and his father worked in the {{software}} development industry, having previously worked on [...] "one of the earliest giant computers in China". Although Chen was interested in art and drawing as a young child, his father influenced him towards computers, entering him in programming contests from when he was 10 years old. He found himself interested in video games that he saw there, but was not as enthusiastic about programming. While a teenager, he had deep emotional experiences with games that he played, including The Legend of Sword and Fairy, which he ascribes {{to the fact that}} he was not as exposed to books, films, or life events that <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> have had those experiences with. These experiences drove him to try to create those types of feelings in games as an adult, when more emotional maturity had caused his [...] "standards to rise" [...] in what would move him in a game. It was during high school that he chose the English name Jenova after a character in Final Fantasy VII, wanting a name that would be unique anywhere he used it as there were [...] "thousands of Jason Chens".|$|E
500|$|The Second World War {{demonstrated}} that science, and physics in particular, now required considerable financial and material resources. To avoid a brain drain to the United States, twelve European countries {{banded together to}} create CERN, a research organisation {{along the lines of}} the national laboratories in the United States, designed to undertake Big Science projects beyond the resources of any one of them alone. Questions soon arose regarding the best location for the facilities. Bohr and Kramers felt that the Institute in Copenhagen would be the ideal site. Pierre Auger, who organised the preliminary discussions, disagreed; he felt that both Bohr and his Institute were past their prime, and that Bohr's presence would overshadow others. After a long debate, Bohr pledged his support to CERN in February 1952, and Geneva was chosen as the site in October. The CERN Theory Group was based in Copenhagen until their new accommodation in Geneva was ready in 1957. Victor Weisskopf, who later became the Director General of CERN, summed up Bohr's role, saying that [...] "there were other personalities who started and conceived the idea of CERN. The enthusiasm and ideas of the <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> not have been enough, however, if a man of his stature had not supported it." ...|$|E
500|$|Carey Mulligan {{plays the}} narrator, Kathy, an introverted, observant {{character}} who projects both innocence and knowingness, and who {{over the course}} of the story develops from a passionate, optimistic child to a wise and accepting young woman. Prior to her casting, Mulligan had already read the novel a few times, considering it to be a favourite of hers. She recalled that from when she first read the book three years ago she had wanted to play Kathy. The young actress said that she could not [...] "bear the idea of anyone else" [...] portraying Kathy, although she acknowledged that she thought <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be able to do a better performance. She was certain that someone would make a film adaptation of the novel and had hoped that they would wait until she would be old enough to play the character. Romanek told The Los Angeles Times that he originally was having difficulty finding the right actress to play Kathy; a tight filming deadline loomed prior to Mulligan's casting. Peter Rice, the head of Fox Searchlight (the company financing the film) was watching An Education at the Sundance Film Festival in January. He wrote Romanek a four-word text message: [...] "Hire the genius Mulligan." [...] When later asked why the message was so abrupt, he explained that he was still in the middle of viewing the film. Rice exhibited what was described as a [...] "rare foresight" [...] in greenlighting a film with an almost unknown lead actress. [...] "He just knew that she was it", said Romanek.|$|E

Shaik's lawyers argued in cross-examination that their own forensic auditor showed that payments to Zuma were {{only a small percentage}} of the group's turnover. Van der Walt replied that [...] "one can have a billion rand turnover and still have an overdraft. If you don't have the money, you can't operate."

According to Radford, [...] "No one suggests that those who reported seeing the Miracle of the Sun—or any other miracles at Fátima or elsewhere—are lying or hoaxing. Instead, they very likely experienced what they claimed to, though that experience took place mostly in their minds." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to a {{research}} paper done by Radboud University, creating positive emotions help to build motivation, relationships, {{and cope with}} failure. It also helps to monitor negative emotions such as anger, frustration or anxiety and control these emotions {{in order to achieve}} a goal (Isabela Granic, Adam Lobel, and Rutger C.M.E. Engels). By learning to motivate themselves, students could push themselves to achieve goals and improve their performance academically as they would improve their performance similarly in their video games. Also, social games that rely on interactions with <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> promote healthy relationships and better communication between their fellow students, teachers and others outside of school. This could also benefit the students to work harder in class to achieve better grades and learn from their mistakes and improve rather than become frustrated.
