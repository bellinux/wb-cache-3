It is brilliant, deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to find, <b>on</b> <b>looking</b> for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, that Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E

5|$|The cup {{stayed in}} the convent until 1882 when the nuns were short of funds and wanted to sell it. It was {{at some point during}} this period that the pearl border to the cover and the Tudor finial were removed. The nuns decided they would get a better price in Paris than in Spain, and the cup was {{entrusted}} to Simon Campo, a priest, who took it to Paris and approached several leading dealers and collectors. There had been a spate of forgeries of medieval objects, and the Parisians were suspicious, until one, Baron Jérôme Pichon, researched the second added cylinder and was sufficiently convinced that this was the cup documented in 1604 to make a rather low offer, which was accepted. In the course of his researches the baron had contacted the current Duke of Frías, who had supplied useful information, and then initially congratulated the buyer on his purchase. However, <b>on</b> <b>looking</b> further into the matter the duke realized that the sale was contrary to the 1610 deed of gift he had discovered in the family archives, and sued in the French courts to recover the cup.|$|E

25|$|Nicolas Flamel is a {{well-known}} alchemist, but {{a good example of}} pseudepigraphy, the practice of giving your works the name of someone else, usually more famous. Though the historical Flamel existed, the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612. Flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher's stone. His work spends {{a great deal of time}} describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations. Most of 'his' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosopher's stone. Through the 14th and 15th centuries, alchemists were much like Flamel: they concentrated <b>on</b> <b>looking</b> for the philosophers' stone. Bernard Trevisan and George Ripley made similar contributions. Their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art.|$|E
25|$|From {{the time}} of Genie's {{admission}} doctors saw clearly picked up some nonverbal information, with Kent emphasizing that she seemed very intent <b>on</b> <b>looking</b> at peoples' faces and made decent eye contact from other people, and she showed {{a small amount of}} responsiveness to it {{even in the absence of}} language. Despite this, Kent noted that she could only get across a few very basic needs and neither made facial expressions nor used any discernible body language. When Genie was upset she would engage in silent, expressionless, self-harming tantrums until she had physically tired herself out, after which she immediately reverted to being completely non-expressive. She never cried during these outbursts—according to several firsthand accounts she could not cry at all—and if she wanted to make noise she pushed chairs or other objects. On a few occasions she responded to stimuli with a very soft, high-pitched, shrill laugh, but was otherwise completely undemonstrative.|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been {{multiple}} international groups that have issued reports addressing issues in special education. The United Nations on “International Norms and Standards relating to Disability” in 1998. This report cites multiple conventions, statements, declarations, and other reports such as: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, The Salamanca Statement, the Sundberg Declaration, the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, and many others. One main point that the report emphasizes is the necessity for education {{to be a human}} right. The report also states that the “quality of education should be equal to that of persons without disabilities.” The other main points brought up by the report discuss integrated education, special education classes as supplementary, teacher training, and equality for vocational education. The United Nations also releases a report by the Special Rapporteur that has a focus on persons with disabilities. In 2015, a report titled “Report of the Special Rapporteur to the 52nd Session of the Commission for Social Development: Note by the Secretary-General on Monitoring of the implementation of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities” was released. This report focused <b>on</b> <b>looking</b> at how the many countries involved, with a focus on Africa, have handled policy regarding persons with disabilities. In this discussion, the author also focuses on the importance of education for persons with disabilities as well as policies that could help improve the education system such as a move towards a more inclusive approach. The World Health Organization has also published a report addressing people with disabilities and within this there is a discussion on education in their “World Report on Disability” in 201. Other organizations that have issued reports discussing the topic are UNESCO, UNICEF, and the World Bank.|$|E

[...] In the original script, the village doctor was supposed to flee the village and get trapped in a swamp. <b>On</b> <b>looking</b> for a suitable mire, the crew found a mill where they saw white shadows around the windows and doors.

500|$|In 1938, Goebbels {{wrote that}} <b>on</b> <b>looking</b> {{at the film}} that he was [...] "struck by the {{dullness}} of its portrayal, the coarseness of its construction, and the inadequacy of its acting." [...] Despite Goebbels statement, he would present the film uncensored {{from time to time}} in private screening rooms for close personal friends. On the French release, The New York Times wrote that [...] "It is the French version of Fritz Lang's production, [...] "Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse" [...] ("Dr. Mabuse's Will"). It is a hallucinating and horrifying story, depicted with great power and the extraordinary beauty of photography that Lang has led his admirers to expect." [...] At the Hungarian premiere of the German-language print in 1933, Variety wrote that the film [...] "...certainly shows the influence of American mystery pictures. The story is very long-winded and even an ingenious director like Fritz Lang could not prevent its being rather slow-moving in places." ...|$|E
500|$|Advertisements {{were issued}} {{and placed in}} newspapers. When a {{subscription}} was circulated for a medal to be struck, the copy read: [...] "The encouragers of this great national undertaking will also have the satisfaction to know, that their names will be handed down to Posterity, as the Patrons of Native Genius, enrolled with their own hands, in the same book, {{with the best of}} Sovereigns." [...] The language of both the advertisement and the medal emphasised the role each subscriber played in the patronage of the arts. The subscribers were primarily middle-class Londoners, not aristocrats. Edmund Malone, himself an editor of a rival Shakespeare edition, wrote that [...] "before the scheme was well-formed, or the proposals entirely printed off, near six hundred persons eagerly set down their names, and paid their subscriptions to a set of books and prints that will cost each person, I think, about ninety guineas; and <b>on</b> <b>looking</b> over the list, there were not above twenty names among them that anybody knew".|$|E
500|$|Olivier's acting {{technique}} was minutely crafted, {{and he was}} known for changing his appearance considerably from role to role. By his own admission, he was addicted to extravagant make-up, and unlike Richardson and Gielgud, he excelled at different voices and accents. His own description of his {{technique was}} [...] "working from the outside in"; he said, [...] "I can never act as myself, I {{have to have a}} pillow up my jumper, a false nose or a moustache or wig... I cannot come <b>on</b> <b>looking</b> like me and be someone else." [...] Rattigan described how at rehearsals Olivier [...] "built his performance slowly and with immense application from a mass of tiny details". This attention to detail had its critics: Agate remarked, [...] "When I look at a watch it is to see the time and not to admire the mechanism. I want an actor to tell me Lear's time of day and Olivier doesn't. He bids me watch the wheels go round." ...|$|E

500|$|Many critics {{praised the}} many subtle {{differences}} between the two universes, while others lauded Leonard Nimoy's appearance as William Bell and his scenes with Walter. Website blogger io9 listed both parts of [...] "Over There" [...] as one of the select few [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to understand the show, referring to it as [...] "one of the most epic season finales ever". Another io9 reviewer called the ending one of the [...] "best SF/fantasy cliffhangers ever shown on television" [...] in a September 2010 list. The finale helped propel Fringe onto a number of 2010 [...] "best of television" [...] lists, including Digital Spy, Entertainment Weekly, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, The Daily Beast, The New York Times, TV Squad, the New York Post, and IGN; the last of these named Fringe the best sci-fi series of 2010, beating fellow nominees Lost, Caprica, and Stargate Universe. Some critics predicted that, because of the increased focus <b>on</b> <b>looking</b> into the alternate universe and advancing its mythology, Fringes [...] "monster-of-the-week" [...] episodes would become less frequent.

500|$|When {{asked whether}} the album was thematically {{different}} from Fallen, Lee said that [...] "all of the negative and hard, difficult experiences" [...] that characterized the band's music still came across, but displays a less hopeless attitude. Rather than wallowing in [...] "the hard stuff", the record's theme reflects <b>on</b> <b>looking</b> for solutions and happiness. In an interview with MTV News, Lee said about the album's title: I feel like I {{have the ability to}} do a lot of things I couldn't do before, for a number of reasons......A lot of doors have kind of been opened in my life—not just since everything has happened for us. The singer also felt the band [...] "broke the doors" [...] and tried doing different things, which was also an inspiration for the title. Simon Cosyns of The Sun labelled the record's artwork—which sees Lee in front of an open door—as [...] " [...] the dark Evanescence image intact, with sinister fairytale scenes, elaborate Victorian gothic arches, illuminated typography and elaborate flowing dresses". Dane Prokofiev of PopMatters praised the album cover, calling it [...] " [...] gother-looking piece." ...|$|E
500|$|DeeKay of SoulCulture {{commented that}} [...] "even with the straightforward, hugely {{predictable}} electro-pop on the Swedish House Mafia-produced 'Numb' and 'Euphoria', Usher is operating {{at a level}} above his David Guetta and RedOne-loving peers." [...] Meelz of ThisGoesIn concluded that [...] "Numb" [...] is a single quality track, [...] "which we can see seeping through the radio {{in the latter half}} of 2012– with the mantra of letting your problems go and dance." [...] The Lanterns Alex Antonetz wrote that both [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Euphoria" [...] are future Charlie Bear fare. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush commented that the song is perfect for the clubs. Ryan Hadfield of Consequence of Sound labeled [...] "Numb" [...] together with [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] and [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] as essential tracks <b>on</b> <b>Looking</b> 4 Myself. Andrew Unterberger of Popdust wrote that the single's production is appropriate for an Usher and Swedish House Mafia collaboration, though criticised its lack of originality. Despite this, Unterberger commended the song, writing [...] "it does have the mind-numbing, body-activating effect the song is so explicitly searching for" [...] and even though you can call it [...] "an EDM cash-in [...] Usher was embracing club music way before most of his American pop star peers hopped on the bandwagon".|$|E
