Spamhaus had the case moved from the state court to the U.S. Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and asked to have the case {{dismissed}} for lack of jurisdiction. The court, presided over by Judge Charles Kocoras, proceeded with the case against Spamhaus without considering the jurisdiction issue, prompting British MP Derek Wyatt to call for the judge to be suspended from office. Not having had its <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> examined, Spamhaus refused {{to participate in the}} U.S. case any further and withdrew its counsel. However, Spamhaus was deemed by the court to have [...] "technically accepted jurisdiction" [...] by having initially responded at all, and the judge, angry at Spamhaus having walked out of his court, awarded e360 a default judgement totaling US$11,715,000 in damages. Spamhaus subsequently announced that it would ignore the judgement because default judgements issued by U.S. courts without a trial [...] "have no validity in the U.K. and cannot be enforced under the British legal system".|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we are trying}} to offer those {{practicing}} law a theoretical and practical approach of some dispositions in Law 202 / October 25, 2010 regarding some measures to accelerate the adjudication of matters, known as the Law on the Small Justice Reform, that amended and completed the Code of Civil Procedure. The law on accelerating justice was adopted only three months and 11 days after the New Code of Civil procedure was published. This law is important due to the content of some dispositions regarding certain institutions of civil procedural law, that have the role intended by the Romanian legislator, to accelerate the determination of matters, institutions that are not found in the New Code. The reform (change) in the Romanian civil trials took into consideration the respect of some principles such as the access to justice, equality of the parties in civil lawsuits, the right to due and fair trial as well as the fact that any reform has to guarantee that the judicial system is efficient, answers the necessity of transparency and democracy. Still, the application of the new dispositions of civil procedure, beginning with Law no. 59 / 1993 and until the coming into force of law on accelerating the determination of matters, namely the past 17 years, the amendments brought to the Code of Civil procedure have not always been beneficial for the Romanian litigant {{by the fact that they}} determined different interpretations leading thus to a non unitary judicial practice even within the same institution. The present law is not safe either from critics that some theoreticians and practitioners of law have expressed, being interested in accomplishing the purpose the Romanian legislator has set in that law. In this paper, the authors aim at analyzing the impact of the abovementioned law, regarding the material competence of the tribunal in trials and the requests regarding claims with the object of payment up to 2000 lei; adjudicating the <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the instance and the effect of non invocating it on legal basis; the solutions that the appeal court can issue. At the same time, without getting into theoretical disputes regarding these issues raised in this study (to avoid issuing decisions that could be given in applying the same norm of procedure, obviously with negative effect on the litigant parties), we will try to propose solutions in case they will be transposed into judicial norms of civil procedure (until the coming into force of the New Code of civil procedure) will have a positive effect in the accelerated development of the Romanian civil trial. We assert that “acceleration in adjudicating civil trials” should not remain a collocation empty of content and this is the reason for which the judicial norms of civil procedure have to be characterized by accuracy and flexibility in application, without the necessity of elaborating an application “guide”...|$|E

Any such objections must be ruled upon before the Court can address the merits of the applicant's claim.

Respondents normally file Preliminary <b>Objections</b> <b>to</b> the <b>jurisdiction</b> of the Court and/or the admissibility of the case.

Although inter-provincial representation on a case by case basis is as common in Canada as is inter-state representation in the United States, the reason for Clark's lack of a case license in British Columbia was that the bar association there refused to grant the normal dispensation to Clark.

5000|$|Though the {{district}} court considered it [...] "unfair and a waste of judicial resources" [...] for the defendant to raise the issue after trial had already been conducted, the court nevertheless ordered both parties to conduct post-trial discovery on the issue, because <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> subject matter <b>jurisdiction</b> could be raised at any stage of litigation. [...] After converting the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment, {{the district}} court determined that the employer criteria were not satisfied, because Y&H's delivery drivers, owner-managers, and their shareholder wives were not [...] "employees" [...] for Title VII purposes, and the company could not meet the requirement without their inclusion. The court vacated its prior judgment in favor of Arbaugh, dismissed her Title VII claim with prejudice, and her state-law claims without prejudice.|$|R
5000|$|The Court {{ruled that}} because {{subject-matter}} jurisdiction {{existed at the}} time of judgment, the jurisdictional defect had been cured, and the Sixth Circuit erred in ruling otherwise. But Lewis had preserved his <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> federal <b>jurisdiction</b> by filing a motion to remand the case to state court and then by raising the issue on appeal. Shouldn't the plaintiff be rewarded for his diligent effort to preserve his choice to try the case in state court? Lewis argued that to allow Caterpillar to benefit from the district court's mistake would encourage defendants to seek removal more often in the hopes that the district court will make a mistake they might exploit. [...] "These arguments are hardly meritless but they run up against an overriding consideration. Once a diversity case has been tried in federal court, with rules of decision supplied by state law under the regime of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, , considerations of finality, efficiency, and economy become overwhelming." [...] If the Court were to require that a case that had proceeded through trial to judgment had to be dismissed afterward for lack of jurisdiction, there would be a tremendous waste of judicial resources. In this case, complete diversity, and hence federal jurisdiction, existed {{at the time of}} judgment. [...] "To wipe out the adjudication postjudgment, and return to state court a case now satisfying all federal jurisdictional requirements, would impose an exorbitant cost on our dual court system, a cost incompatible with the fair and unprotracted administration of justice." [...] Furthermore, the Court did not foresee that premature removal requests would prove to be the temptation Lewis envisioned. Instead, the Court trusted district courts to apply the removal rules properly, and observed that the fear of irritating district judges would deter defendants from filing frivolous removal requests.|$|R

40|$|The Brazilian {{arbitration}} law of 1996 {{has greatly}} facilitated the {{recognition and enforcement}} of foreign arbitral awards. Its rules are remarkably more efficient than the previous ones and those still governing the recognition and enforcement of foreign state court decisions. Out of the eighteen requests for recognition of foreign arbitral awards that were made since the constitutional reallocation of the recognition procedure in December 2004 with the Superior Federal Court, only four were rejected. The Superior Federal Court has shown an encouraging level of deference to arbitral awards by limiting its scrutiny to merely formal aspects. A request for recognition {{must be accompanied by}} the award and the written arbitration agreement; the latter is dispensable if the adversary participated in arbitration proceedings without raising an <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> the tribunal's <b>jurisdiction.</b> If the adversary refused to participate in proceedings, the award is not recognized if the adversary had not been correctly summoned to participate. The proceedings for obtaining recognition are free of charge; the prevailing party can recover its legal fees from the unsuccessful party insofar as they are considered reasonable by the Court. The duration of these proceedings varies between 1 and 3 years, depending on the circumstances of the case. Interim measures of protection during this period are granted only in very exceptional cases. All in all, the Court's handling of requests for recognition can be summarized as quite efficient, and even more so if compared to the some of the disappointing tendencies in other Latin-American countries.
