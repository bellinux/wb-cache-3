5|$|The creek flooded in September 1850. It was {{the most}} severe flood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> up to that time. In January 1996, 400 {{buildings}} along Solomon Creek flooded by it due to melting snow. This was one of numerous floods on that area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek.</b>|$|E
5|$|The tributaries Sugar Notch Run and Spring Run lose most {{of their}} {{discharge}} (75% {{in the case of}} Spring Run) when passing over subterranean mine pools.

5|$|A {{gristmill}} {{built at}} the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> {{was one of the}} first manufacturing buildings on the West Branch Susquehanna River upstream of Big Island. In 1864 a large sawmill was constructed on Tangascootack Creek a short distance above the mouth and several years later a shingle mill was built in the area. The sawmill was also expanded and six dams were constructed on the creek. The total cost of this project was $100,000. Agriculture was another industry that was practiced in the area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> in the early 1900s. In 1859 the Sunbury and Erie Railroad went into the creek's valley.|$|E

5|$|A rock {{formation}} {{known as}} the Campbell's Ledge Black Shale occurs {{in the vicinity of}} Leggetts Creek. This rock formation contains shale and coal.

5|$|Areas along Fishing Creek contain pools {{followed}} by riffles, which are further {{followed by}} more pools. This configuration of pools and riffles creates an ideal situation for fly-fishing.

5|$|As of 2003, {{there were}} 581 water rights {{recorded}} in the watershed, with 394 of them related to irrigation. Four hundred sixty-six water diversions were also recorded.

50|$|Salt Creek {{begins in}} a series of small canyons west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Street <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Golden Lantern, an {{arterial}} roadway that connects with Dana Point at the south end. <b>The</b> canyon <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> begins in is protected as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Salt <b>Creek</b> Corridor Regional Park, which covers most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creek's</b> course. <b>The</b> <b>creek</b> winds west through the narrow gorge, picking up runoff from numerous residential communities both north and south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Salt <b>Creek</b> Canyon.
