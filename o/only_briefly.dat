5|$|A {{man named}} Gianni Schicchi is <b>only</b> <b>briefly</b> {{referred}} to in Dante's Inferno Canto XXX. In that canto, Dante visits the Circle of Impersonators and sees a man savagely attacking another.

5|$|This first castle {{was used}} <b>only</b> <b>briefly</b> {{and seems to}} have been {{abandoned}} {{by the middle of the}} 12th century. The grain stores were destroyed by fire, but the reason for this is uncertain. By this period, the town of Lydford as a whole was also in serious economic decline.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the war in November 1918 and the {{dissolution}} of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf was transferred to the fledgling Royal Yugoslav Navy, who renamed her Kumbor. She remained in the Yugoslav inventory <b>only</b> <b>briefly,</b> being broken up for scrap in 1922.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} of the plans of the Governor-General of the Philippines to deport Don Felipe, he sailed to Yokohama, Japan, staying there <b>only</b> <b>briefly</b> until proceeding to Hong Kong where he joined other Filipino exiles who found asylum when the revolution broke out in 1896. Twenty-two months after the departure of Don Felipe for Hong Kong, Agoncillo {{and the rest of}} the family (her last two daughters were not yet born) followed him into exile. They rented a house at 535 Morrison Hill in the Wan Chai district. While in Hong Kong, Agoncillo gave birth to their last child on March 22, 1906.|$|E

5|$|All {{who were}} wounded and {{captured}} recovered {{to return home}} after the war. In 1965, the U.S. Army published a multi-volume history of World War II, including one on The Ardennes: The Battle of the Bulge. Author Hugh M. Cole <b>only</b> <b>briefly</b> mentioned Bouck's platoon, which upset former platoon member William James (who had changed his name from Tsakanikas). James contacted Bouck and encouraged him to get his men proper recognition.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} {{developed}} {{very close to}} shore, it <b>only</b> <b>briefly</b> traveled west-northwest before making landfall near Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico early on June 29 as a weak tropical storm. It continued inland, producing heavy rain over the state of Veracruz until dissipating over the mountains of San Luis Potosí late on June 29. Hundreds of homes were damaged, and several towns, including Naranjos and Chinampa, about 60miles (95km) south of Tampico, were severely flooded, but the only reported fatalities were the two occupants of a car that was swept away by floodwaters in Naranjos.|$|E
5|$|Before Indiana {{became a}} state, the Indiana Territory had two governors. William Henry Harrison, the first governor, built a plantation-style home in Vincennes, and named it Grouseland for its many birds. Built in 1804, {{it was one}} of the first brick {{buildings}} in the territory. The home is still preserved and is a National Historic Landmark. Thomas Posey, the territory's second governor, had a home built in Corydon, but lived there <b>only</b> <b>briefly</b> before moving to Jeffersonville where he rented a room in a boarding house. The Posey House is preserved as part of a National Historic District.|$|E

5|$|Cairano's {{concentration}} on the Caesars is interrupted <b>only</b> <b>briefly</b> by {{the return of}} Tamagnino between 1499 and 1500. Tamagnino, likely based on his lauded works at the Certosa di Pavia, receives a commission for six different Caesars and other sculptures. But in an art scene increasingly monopolised by Cairano, who {{has come a long}} way from his naive expression of the Apostles, Tamagnino does not garner much attention, and, humiliated by the cold reception, he leaves Brescia, probably never to return.|$|E
5|$|Freya {{served in}} the German fleet for the initial years of her career, unlike her sister ships, all of which served abroad on foreign stations. As a result, she led a fairly uneventful career in the fleet. After a {{modernization}} in 19051907, Freya {{was used as a}} school ship for cadets. At the outbreak of World War I, Freya was mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group, but served in front-line duty <b>only</b> <b>briefly.</b> She was used as a barracks ship after 1915, and ultimately sold for scrapping in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Id Software's use of {{texture mapping}} in Catacomb 3-D, a {{precursor}} to Wolfenstein 3D, was influenced by Ultima Underworld. Conflicting accounts exist regarding the extent of this influence, however. In the book Masters of Doom, author David Kushner asserts that the concept was discussed <b>only</b> <b>briefly</b> during a 1991 telephone conversation between Paul Neurath and John Romero. However, Doug Church has said that John Carmack saw the game's summer 1990 software convention demo, and recalled a comment from Carmack that he could write a faster texture mapper. Paul Neurath has recounted the incident similarly, with both Carmack and Romero present.|$|E

5|$|In 1735, George Frideric Handel {{wrote the}} opera Samson, with a {{libretto}} by Newburgh Hamilton, based on Samson Agonistes. The opera {{is almost entirely}} set inside Samson's prison and Delilah <b>only</b> <b>briefly</b> appears in Act II. In 1877, Camille Saint-Saëns composed the opera Samson and Delilah with a libretto by Ferdinand Lemaire in which the entire story of Samson and Delilah is retold. In the libretto, Delilah is portrayed as a seductive femme fatale, but the music played during her parts invokes sympathy for her.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, {{while serving}} on the Texas {{frontier}} after the war, {{he was promoted to}} first lieutenant and then to captain in the 9th Infantry Regiment in 1855. In 1853, Pickett challenged a fellow junior officer, future Union general Winfield Scott Hancock, to a duel; (they had met <b>only</b> <b>briefly</b> when Hancock was passing through Texas). Hancock declined the duel, a response not unlikely as dueling had fallen out of favor at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 he {{was dropped}} from the {{ministry}} but was later elected as the Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1937, holding office until the Mair Government lost power in 1941. Weaver then witnessed {{the death of the}} United Australia Party in 1943 and became the leader of the new Democratic Party in 1944. He was then involved in the negotiations to form the future Liberal Party of Australia, which were ultimately successful, with Weaver becoming the first leader of the Liberal Party in April 1945. He served <b>only</b> <b>briefly</b> until dying {{of a heart attack in}} November 1945.|$|E

5|$|Kolberg saw {{action in}} several engagements with the British during the war, {{including}} the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in December 1914 and the Battle of Dogger Bank the following month. She also saw {{action against the}} Russians on two occasions, during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 and Operation Albion in November 1917. After {{the end of the}} war, she was ceded to France as a war prize and renamed Colmar. She served <b>only</b> <b>briefly</b> in the French Navy, including a deployment to Asia in 1924. She was stricken in 1927 and broken up two years later.|$|E
5|$|One {{result of}} Wallace's early travels {{is a modern}} {{controversy}} about his nationality. Since Wallace was born in Monmouthshire, some sources have considered him to be Welsh. However, some historians have questioned this because neither of his parents was Welsh, his family <b>only</b> <b>briefly</b> lived in Monmouthshire, the Welsh people Wallace knew in his childhood considered him to be English, and because Wallace himself consistently referred to himself as English rather than Welsh (even when writing about his time in Wales). One Wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore {{that he was an}} Englishman born in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Wilde, a {{critical}} study by Arthur Ransome {{was published in}} 1912. The book <b>only</b> <b>briefly</b> mentioned Wilde's life, but subsequently Ransome (and The Times Book Club) were sued for libel by Lord Alfred Douglas. The trial in April 1913 was in a way a re-run of the trials of Oscar Wilde. The trial resulted from Douglas's rivalry with Robbie Ross for Wilde (and his need of money). Douglas lost after a reading of De Profundis refuted his claims.|$|E
