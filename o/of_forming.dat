The results indicate that M. racemosus has two isozymes <b>of</b> pyruvate kinase, <b>form</b> A and form B, which are clearly separable on ion-exchange columns (diethylaminoethyl-cellulose). Addition of glucose to cultures growing on amino acids in air resulted in the induction <b>of</b> <b>form</b> A and the termination <b>of</b> <b>form</b> B synthesis. Cycloheximide added {{at the same time}} as glucose blocked the formation <b>of</b> <b>form</b> A but did not interfere with the termination <b>of</b> <b>form</b> B synthesis.

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the Vietnamese occupation, the Kampuchean {{resistance}} groups had limited contact with each other due to their differences. Even though the Khmer Rouge enjoyed widespread international recognition, by 1980 the organization was under pressure to reform itself from the international community. ASEAN, which had backed the Khmer Rouge throughout their diplomatic confrontations with the PRK regime at the UN General Assembly in 1979, urged the Khmer Rouge leadership to put its blood-stained image behind it in order to join forces with other non-communist movements. However, the idea <b>of</b> <b>forming</b> an alliance with the Khmer Rouge initially caused a certain degree of uneasiness within the leadership circles of the FUNCINPEC and the KPNLF, because both groups were leery about joining with a communist organization well known for its brutality.

5|$|Few {{inorganic}} lead(IV) compounds are known, {{and these}} exist only in highly acidic solutions. Lead(II) oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation, Pb3O4. It {{is described as}} lead(II,IV) oxide, or structurally 2PbO·PbO2, and is the best-known mixed valence lead compound. Lead dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas. This is because the expected PbCl4 that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to PbCl2 and Cl2. Analogously to lead monoxide, lead dioxide is capable <b>of</b> <b>forming</b> plumbate anions. Lead disulfide and lead diselenide are only stable at high pressures. Lead tetrafluoride, a yellow crystalline powder, is stable, but less so than the difluoride.
