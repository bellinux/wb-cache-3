5|$|After several {{seasons of}} {{struggling}} for runs, Kippax returned {{to form in}} 193334. Against Queensland at New Year, he hit 125 and shared a stand of 363 in only 135minutes with Bradman. Altogether, he made four centuries and averaged almost 72 to earn selection for the 1934 tour of England. Passed <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> vice-captaincy of the team in favour of Bradman, Kippax had the confidence of knowing that the Australian Board of Control had reached {{an agreement with the}} MCC that the Australians would not have to face Bodyline during the tour.|$|E
5|$|Bean {{has done}} {{voice-over}} work, {{mostly in the}} British advertising industry. He has featured in television adverts for O2, Morrisons and Barnardos {{as well as for}} Acuvue and the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States. He also does the voice <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> National Blood Service's television and radio campaign. For the role playing video game, , he voiced Martin Septim.

5|$|Early in {{the first}} half, by much rushing, forcing, snapbacks and {{vigorous}} bullyragging Riggs, the huge Hopkins quarterback, crashed over the goal line for 4 points. Paul Dashiell converted. Riggs repeated his performance but Dashiell missed conversion. Navy then adopted the Hopkins rushing tactics and Stone went <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first score.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, he {{returned}} to Vanderbilt as {{head coach of the}} basketball team and assistant football coach. In his second stint as Vanderbilt's basketball coach, Cody went 51–50. In 1934, when McGugin retired, Cody was passed <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> head coaching job in favor of former Vanderbilt quarterback and SMU coach Ray Morrison. Morrison brought his own staff from SMU and neglected Cody's coaching abilities, but Cody remained basketball coach through the 1935–1936 season. His Commodores basketball teams tallied 51–50 in five seasons.|$|E
5|$|Jupp Heynckes {{was hired}} as coach in 1987, but after two {{consecutive}} championships in 1988–89 and 1989–90, Bayern's form dipped. After finishing second in 1990–91, the club finished just five points above the relegation places in 1991–92. In 1993–94, Bayern was eliminated in the UEFA Cup second round to Premier League side Norwich City, who remain the only English club to beat Bayern at the Olympiastadion. Success returned when Franz Beckenbauer took <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{second half of the}} 1993–94 season, winning the championship again after a four-year gap. Beckenbauer was then appointed club president.|$|E
5|$|North Vietnamese {{attention}} then {{shifted to}} Ranger South, where 400 South Vietnamese troops, including the 109 survivors of Ranger North, held the outpost {{for another two}} days before General Lãm ordered them to fight their way five kilometers southeast to FSB 30. Another casualty of the battle, although an indirect one, was South Vietnamese General Đỗ Cao Trí, commander of III Corps and hero of the Cambodian campaign. Ordered by President Thieu to take <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> outclassed Lãm, Trí died in a helicopter crash on 23 February while en route to his new command.|$|E

50|$|Cake Mania 3 is {{the sequel}} to Cake Mania 2. New {{features}} include mini-games and power-ups {{as well as the}} introduction of voice <b>overs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> different storyboards throughout the game.|$|R
5|$|On March 18, 2014 {{following}} {{a review of}} 23 other Citations of Hispanic, and Jewish soldiers {{that may have been}} passed <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Medal of Honor due to their race or religion, former Special Forces soldier Melvin Morris, an African American was selected to be included into the review in order to allow his Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) Medal, which is the United States Army's second highest award for combat valor to be upgraded to the Medal of Honor (MOH) the Nation's highest decoration for courage in combat.|$|E
5|$|Other genre {{productions}} {{that have}} been compared with the serial include the 1970 Doctor Who story Spearhead from Space.

5|$|The 102d Fighter Interceptor Wing {{lost its}} F-106s on 5 January 1988. Between January and April 1988, the wing {{converted}} to the F-15A Eagle, which it {{received from the}} 5th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron which was inactivating at Minot Air Force Base. It then resumed its alert commitment at Otis, and also established a new Detachment 1 at Loring Air Force Base, taking <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> inactivating 5th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. The 102d was the first Air National Guard unit to be equipped with the F-15.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} not yet <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand Division as it was ordered to {{continue}} to chase the Germans and secure the Bancourt Ridge, in front of which the villages of Bancourt and Frémicourt lay. The advance was renewed on 30 August, with two battalions of the 1st Infantry Brigade tasked with capturing Bancourt while the New Zealand Rifle Brigade was to take Frémicourt. They were then to push onto Bancourt Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Writer Christos Gage took <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Secret Invasion tie-in stories, which {{end with}} Osborn taking {{credit for the}} defeat of the Skrulls after he kills the Skrull queen Veranke. This allowed the {{character}} to be placed into an influential position in the aftermath Dark Reign. Although the dark turn at the end was always part of the plan for the storyline, Brian Michael Bendis, Secret Invasions writer, says that Osborn was picked for the leading role because of the changes implemented by Ellis.|$|E
5|$|By the 7th century Reculver {{had become}} a landed estate of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Kent. The site of the Roman fort was given <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{establishment}} of a monastery dedicated to St Mary in 669AD, and King Eadberht II of Kent was buried there in the 760s. During the Middle Ages Reculver was a thriving township with a weekly market and a yearly fair, {{and it was a}} member of the Cinque Port of Sandwich. The settlement declined as the Wantsum Channel silted up, and coastal erosion claimed many buildings constructed on the soft sandy cliffs. The village was largely abandoned in the late 18th century, and most of the church was demolished in the early 19th century. Protecting the ruins and the rest of Reculver from erosion is an ongoing challenge.|$|E
50|$|Blackheath's {{sporting}} {{claim to}} fame is that Don Bradman hit a century off three <b>overs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Blackheath team in November 1931 at Blackheath Oval in a social match against Lithgow. He went on to make 256.|$|R

5|$|Due to Nelsen's injury, Gault {{was given}} the start in next week's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, facing off against fellow rookie and first overall draft pick, Terry Bradshaw. In his only career start, he {{completed}} one pass for 44 yards in 16 attempts, threw two interceptions, and finished {{the game with a}} 0.0 passer rating. He also led the Browns to only three first downs during the first half, and as a result Phipps took over at quarterback; the Browns {{went on to win the}} game, 15-7. Nelsen recovered from the injury the following week and turn back <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Browns at quarterback; Gault did not play another snap that season. Entering the 1971 season, Gault modified his throwing style after discussion with new head coach Nick Skorich, and was throwing better in training camp as a result. After training camp ended, however, he was placed on the practice squad, where he remained throughout the season.|$|E
5|$|Following William's {{return to}} Jerusalem in 1165, King Amalric {{made him an}} {{ambassador}} to the Byzantine Empire. William became tutor to the king's son, the future King Baldwin IV, whom William discovered to be a leper. After Amalric's death, William became chancellor and archbishop of Tyre, two of the highest offices in the kingdom, and in 1179 William led the eastern delegation to the Third Council of the Lateran. As {{he was involved in}} the dynastic struggle that developed during Baldwin IV's reign, his importance waned when a rival faction gained control of royal affairs. He was passed <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> prestigious Patriarchate of Jerusalem, and died in obscurity, probably in 1186.|$|E
5|$|From December 1978 to May 1980, Braniff International Airways leased 11 Concordes, five from Air France and six from British Airways. These {{were used}} on subsonic flights between Dallas-Fort Worth and Washington Dulles International Airport, flown by Braniff flight crews. Air France and British Airways crews then took <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{continuing}} supersonic flights to London and Paris. The aircraft were registered {{in both the}} United States and their home countries; the European registration was covered while being operated by Braniff, retaining full AF/BA liveries. The flights were not profitable and typically less than 50% booked, forcing Braniff to end its tenure as the only US Concorde operator in May 1980.|$|E
50|$|He {{made his}} One Day International (ODI) debut against England on 20 June 2015. With his first delivery, he removed Jason Roy {{for his first}} ODI wicket, and {{finished}} with figures of 1 for 40 in 4 <b>overs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> match.|$|R
5000|$|Looking to be <b>over</b> [...]500 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{second time}} this season, Washington {{returned}} home to face the 4-0 Atlanta Falcons, in hopes of snapping a 7-game home losing streak, as well as, as previously mentioned, be <b>over</b> [...]500 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time since Week 1.|$|R
25|$|Pakistan {{declared}} after Inzamam got his century, {{shortly before}} {{lunch on the}} fifth day, and in the sixth over they fell to 20/4.

5|$|He was {{appointed}} {{as the military}} secretary to Sir John Byng, the Commander-in-Chief, Ireland, and in July 1831 became the State Secretary to the Marquess of Anglesey, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He was promoted to colonel on 22 July 1830. In 1834 he became the Inspector-General of Police in Ulster, but was passed <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> position of Inspector-General of the Irish constabulary in 1836; the possibility of his appointment to the latter post had caused some concern among Irish Tories, who felt he was too critical of the Orange Order. He was later rumoured to {{be a candidate for}} the governorship of Dominica, in the West Indies, though this post {{does not seem to have}} materialised. In 1838 he was ordered to Canada to act as adjutant-general for the force garrisoned there after the Rebellions of 1837. When Lord Hill was retiring from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1839, Anglesey was suggested as a replacement to succeed him, although he eventually turned down the job; had he taken it up, Stovin was widely expected to become his personal secretary, the same capacity he had served in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Waters {{suggested}} a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With {{the onset of}} the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.|$|E
5|$|In 294, Narseh, {{a son of}} Shapur who {{had been}} passed <b>over</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sassanid succession, {{came to power in}} Persia. Narseh {{eliminated}} Bahram III, a young man installed in the wake of Bahram II's death in 293. In early 294, Narseh sent Diocletian the customary package of gifts between the empires, and Diocletian responded with an exchange of ambassadors. Within Persia, however, Narseh was destroying every trace of his immediate predecessors from public monuments. He sought to identify himself with the warlike kings Ardashir (r. 226–41) and Shapur I (r. 241–72), who had defeated and imprisoned Emperor Valerian (r. 253–260) following his failed invasion of the Sasanian Empire.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, through {{sales of}} copies of his {{cartoons}} about the space shuttle Challenger accident, Ohman raised <b>over</b> $30,000 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> families of the astronauts.
