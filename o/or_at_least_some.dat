The prayers, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> of them, {{can be traced back to}} a very early date from occasional references in letters of the Church Fathers: the prayers beginning Te igitur, Memento Domine and Quam oblationem were already in use, even if not with quite the same wording as now, by the year 400; the Communicantes, the Hanc igitur, and the post-consecration Memento etiam and Nobis quoque were added in the 5th century.|$|E

25|$|Many {{aspects of}} {{structural}} quality can be evaluated only statically through {{the analysis of}} the software inner structure, its source code, at the unit level, the technology level and the system level, which is in effect how its architecture adheres to sound principles of software architecture outlined in a paper on the topic by OMG. But some structural qualities, such as usability, can be assessed only dynamically (users or others acting in their behalf interact with the software <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>some</b> prototype or partial implementation; even the interaction with a mock version made in cardboard represents a dynamic test because such version can be considered a prototype). Other aspects, such as reliability, might involve not only the software but also the underlying hardware, therefore, it can be assessed both statically and dynamically (stress test).|$|E
25|$|PAC, {{with its}} {{operational}} headquarters in Iquitos, dominated {{the city and}} the region. The area was separated from the main population of Peru by the Andes, and it was 1900 miles from the Amazon's mouth at Pará. The British-registered company was effectively controlled by the archetypal rubber baron Julio Cesar Arana and his brother. Born in Lima, Arana had climbed out of poverty to own and operate a company harvesting great quantities of rubber in the Peruvian Amazon, which was much in demand on the world market. The rubber boom had led to expansion in Iquitos as a trading center, as all the company rubber was shipped down the Amazon River from there to the Atlantic port. Numerous foreigners had flocked to the area seeking their fortunes in the rubber boom, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> piece of the business. The rough frontier city, both respectable businesses and the vice district, was highly dependent on the PAC.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems that}} {{on the level of}} the organ, the leaf may be the {{ancestor}} of the flower, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> floral organs. When we mutate some crucial genes involved in flower development, we end up with a cluster of leaf-like structures. Thus, sometime in history, the developmental program leading to formation of a leaf must have been altered to generate a flower. There probably also exists an overall robust framework within which the floral diversity has been generated. An example of that is a gene called LEAFY (LFY), which is involved in flower development in Arabidopsis thaliana. The homologs of this gene are found in angiosperms as diverse as tomato, snapdragon, pea, maize and even gymnosperms. Expression of Arabidopsis thaliana LFY in distant plants like poplar and citrus also results in flower-production in these plants. The LFY gene regulates the expression of some gene belonging to the MADS-box family. These genes, in turn, act as direct controllers of flower development.|$|E

25|$|It is {{apparent}} that Adi's traditional rivals within the Tayy from the Banu Nabhan (led by Zayd's son Muhalhil) and Banu La'm (led by Thumama ibn Aws), <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> of their members, joined Tulayha in Buzakha (in northern Najd), while their other members also defected but remained in Jabal Tayy. Adi persuaded the latter to return to Islam, which they agreed to. However, they refused to abandon their tribesmen in Buzakha, fearing Tulayha would hold them hostage if he discovered they joined the Muslims. Thus, Adi and the Muslim Tayyids devised a strategy to lure the Tayy in Tulayha's camp to return to Jabal Tayy by issuing a false claim that the Muslims were attacking them. When the apostate Tayyids reached their tribesmen in Jabal Tayy, far from Tulayha's reach, they discovered the false alarm and were persuaded to rejoin Islam. With this, {{the entirety of the}} Al al-Ghawth had returned to the Muslim side. However, the Al Jadila remained in revolt and the Muslim commander Khalid ibn al-Walid was set to move against them. He was stopped by the intercession of Adi, who was able secure the Al Jadila's allegiance through diplomacy.|$|E

You do see some ingenious daredevil feats, but they're crowded {{together}} and, the way they're set up, they don't give you the irresponsible, giddy tingle you're hoping for." [...] Kael also singled out the dispirited direction and the hopeless script. [...] "Director John Glen stages the slaughter scenes so apathetically that the picture itself seems dissociated. (I don't think I've ever seen another movie in which race horses were mistreated and the director failed to work up any indignation. If Glen has any emotions about what he puts on the screen, he keeps them to himself.)" ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{reconstruction}} {{was given}} by Buckland himself. He considered Megalosaurus to be a quadruped. He {{thought it was an}} [...] "amphibian", i.e. an animal capable of both swimming in the sea and walking on land. Generally, in his mind Megalosaurus resembled a gigantic lizard, but Buckland already understood from the form of the thighbone head that the legs were not so much sprawling as held rather upright. In the original description of 1824, Buckland repeated Cuvier's size estimate that Megalosaurus would have been forty feet long with the weight of a seven foot tall elephant. However, this had been based on the remains present at Oxford. Buckland had also been hurried into naming his new reptile by a visit he had made to the fossil collection of Mantell, who during the lecture announced to have acquired a fossil thighbone of enormous magnitude, twice as long as that just described. Today, this is known to have belonged to Iguanodon, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> iguanodontid, but at the time both men assumed this bone belonged to Megalosaurus also. Even taking into account the effects of allometry, heavier animals having relatively stouter bones, Buckland was forced in the printed version of his lecture to estimate the maximum length of Megalosaurus at sixty to seventy feet. The existence of Megalosaurus posed some problems for christian orthodoxy, which typically held that suffering and death had only come into the world through Original Sin, which seemed irreconcilable with the presence of a gigantic devouring reptile during a pre-Adamitic phase of history. Buckland rejected the usual solution, that such carnivores would originally have been peaceful vegetarians, as infantile and claimed in one of the Bridgewater Treatises that Megalosaurus had played a beneficial rôle in creation by ending the lives of old and ill animals, [...] "to diminish the aggregate amount of animal suffering".|$|E

2500|$|Critics of this {{typically}} {{argue that}} some of the proposed criteria for personhood would disqualify two classes of born human beings – reversibly comatose patients, and human infants – from having a right to life, since they, like fetuses, are not self-conscious, do not communicate, and so on. [...] Defenders of the proposed criteria may respond that the reversibly comatose do satisfy the relevant criteria because they [...] "retain all their unconscious mental states". <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> higher brain function (brain waves). Warren concedes that infants are not [...] "persons" [...] by her proposed criteria, and on that basis she and others, including the moral philosopher Peter Singer, conclude that infanticide could be morally acceptable under some circumstances (for example if the infant is severely disabled or in order to save the lives of several other infant's.) [...] Critics may see such concessions as an indication that the right to life cannot be adequately defined by reference to developed psychological featured.|$|E

2500|$|Savoy Theatre audiences {{were not}} {{enthusiastic}} about the piece. [...] "The Savoy is {{in the minds of}} the public so essentially identified with a light after-dinner entertainment that romantic opera is not to the taste of its patrons". [...] Reviewers noted that the opera was [...] "mounted with the artistic finish, completeness, and liberality customary at this popular theatre. [...] Sir Arthur has had to deal with a subject differing widely from those which, at the Savoy, his dainty and humorous muse is so thoroughly identified. This, and the inferiority of the lyrics … must be taken into account. … [...] Speaking for ourselves, we confess freely to disappointment." [...] They found it too long, disjointed and dull, disliked the pseudo-archaic dialogue and nearly all condemned the lyrics. [...] They noted its lack of humour and the satire for which Savoy pieces had been famous. [...] A few critics found much to like in the story, and many praised most of the cast (except for Philip and Guntran) and Sullivan's music, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> of it.|$|E
2500|$|Aristotle {{attempted}} {{to demonstrate the}} unity of God; but from the view which he maintained, that matter was eternal, it followed that God could not be the Creator of the world. To assert that God's knowledge extends only to the general laws of the universe, and not to individual and accidental things, is tantamount to denying prophecy. One other part of Aristotle's theory shocked {{the faith of the}} Mutakallamin [...] the Aristotelian theory of the soul. According to Aristotelianism, the human soul is simply man's substantial form, the set of properties that make matter into a living human body. This seems to imply that the human soul cannot exist apart from the body. Indeed, Aristotle writes, [...] "It is clear that the soul, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> parts of it (if it is divisible), cannot be separated from the body. [...] And thus, those have the right idea who think that the soul does not exist without the body." [...] In Aristotelianism, at least one psychological force, the active intellect, can exist apart from the body. However, according to many interpretations, the active intellect is a superhuman entity emanating from God and enlightening the human mind, not a part of any individual human soul. Thus, Aristotle's theories seem to deny the immortality of the individual human soul.|$|E
2500|$|Hughes {{met with}} the Victorian Political Executive of the Labor Party, chaired by Executive President E.J. Holloway. [...] "For an hour, he {{addressed}} members, trying by {{every one of his}} many oratorical, logical and political tricks to convert all, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some,</b> of the Executive members to support his referendum campaign". Arguing on points of morale and maintaining Australian honour, Hughes concluded that he [...] "was going to fight for a 'Yes' vote as though he were fighting for his very life". Holloway and his supporters were unconvinced, and were not moved by the speech. Hughes would have a similar lack of success at other state Labor organisations. Days later he spoke before the New South Wales Labor executive and then a special meeting convened of the New South Wales Trades and Labor Council. No records are kept of those meetings; however, motions were passed at their conclusion reaffirming opposition to conscription. Some prominent Labor politicians, though, including New South Wales Premier William Holman and South Australian Premier Crawford Vaughan, backed Hughes and rejected the party line. Ultimately, Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria declared themselves against the proposal in state caucuses. South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania did not take a position, and supported the principle of the referendum for the people to decide. Hughes had been unsuccessful in taking the bulk of his party along with him.|$|E
