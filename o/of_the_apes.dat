5|$|Development for a Planet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apes</b> remake {{started as}} far back as 1988 with Adam Rifkin. His project nearly reached the {{pre-production}} stage before being canceled. Terry Hayes's script, titled Return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apes,</b> would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, under the direction of Phillip Noyce. Oliver Stone, Don Murphy, and Jane Hamsher were set to produce. Creative differences ensued between Hayes and financier/distributor 20th Century Fox.

It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash-landing on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes. The apes treat humans as slaves, but {{with the help of an}} ape named Ari, Leo starts a rebellion.|$|E

5|$|With William Broyles, Jr.'s script, Burton {{was hired}} as director, and the film was put into active development. Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal rewrote the script, and filming took place from November 2000 to April 2001. Planet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apes</b> was {{released}} to mixed reviews, but was a financial success. Much criticism focused on the confusing plot and ending, although Rick Baker's prosthetic makeup designs were praised. Despite its financial success, 20th Century Fox chose not to produce a sequel, and later rebooted the franchise in 2011 with Rise of the Planet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Burton {{had never}} been {{particularly}} close to his parents, but his father's death in October 2000 and his mother's in March 2002 affected him deeply. Following the production of Planet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apes</b> (2001), the director {{wanted to get back}} to making a smaller film. Burton enjoyed the script, feeling that it was the first unique story he was offered since Beetlejuice (1988). Burton also found appeal in the story's combination of an emotional drama with exaggerated tall tales, which allowed him to tell various stories of different genres. He signed to direct in April 2002, which prompted Richard D. Zanuck, who worked with Burton on Planet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apes,</b> to join Big Fish as a producer. Zanuck also had a difficult relationship with his own father, Darryl F. Zanuck, who once fired him as head of production at 20th Century Fox.|$|E

40|$|Ape {{language}} {{research has}} typically employed cognitive descriptions of ape competencies. Recently, Epstein, Lanza, and Skinner (1980) attempted to simulate some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ape</b> findings with pigeons. They also used cognitive terms {{to describe their}} results, but with “tongue-in-cheek. ” In <b>the</b> hope <b>of</b> bringing about a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ape</b> research, this paper describes <b>the</b> main aspects <b>of</b> one ape language project, using a behavior-analytic framework. It then briefly compares and contrasts, from that perspective, the training programs used with pigeons and with apes. It is concluded that the behavior-analytic framework, and the procedures devised to produce language skills in apes, provide strong support for several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major positions set forth in Skinner's (1957) Verbal Behavior...|$|R
5|$|To {{compose the}} film score, Burton hired regular {{collaborator}} Danny Elfman, {{who had previously}} been set as composer when Adam Rifkin was to do his remake in 1989.

5|$|On February 23, 2011, Franco made a cameo {{appearance}} on NBC's Minute to Win It where the real-life Ralston was participating as a contestant playing for charity. After having an uncredited cameo {{in the opening}} scene of The Green Hornet (2011), he starred opposite Natalie Portman and Danny McBride in the Medieval fantasy comedy Your Highness. In the film, he plays Fabious, a prince who teams up with his brother (McBride) to rescue the soon to be bride of Fabious (played by Zooey Deschanel). In May 2010, he was cast to star in Rupert Wyatt's $93million budgeted Rise of the Planet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apes,</b> a reboot of the Planet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apes</b> series which was released on August 5. Franco starred alongside Winona Ryder in The Letter, originally entitled The Stare, directed by Jay Anania. He was cast as a drug-addicted lawyer in About Cherry, also starring Heather Graham, which started shooting the following month in California. He {{dropped out of the}} indie film While We're Young to star in Oz the Great and Powerful, a Disney prequel to L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900). Filming began in July 2011, and the film was released on March 8, 2013. He has signed to do a sequel to it.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{score was}} {{composed}} by John Mark Painter, {{who along with}} his wife Fleming McWilliams, constituted the rock duo Fleming and John in the 1990s.

The score was inspired by music from the 1960s and the soundtracks to Planet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apes,</b> Dark Shadows, and The Untouchables have been cited as influences, as well as the works of Henry Mancini.|$|E

5|$|After {{playing one}} of the titular roles in the romantic drama Tristan & Isolde (2006), Franco starred in the Tony Bill-directed war drama Flyboys (2006).

For the former, he {{was nominated for a}} Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Comedy. Franco portrayed the trapped canyoneer Aron Ralston in 127 Hours (2010), a survival drama, which earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. Franco appeared in four films in 2011, including the poorly-received fantasy film Your Highness, and the science fiction film Rise of the Planet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apes</b> (2011), a critical and commercial success.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, after 20th Century Fox had greenlit James Cameron's {{version of}} the film remake, the company's video game division, Fox Interactive, started {{planning}} a video game tie-in. The film project went on hold when Cameron pulled out, but Fox Interactive remained confident a remake would progress eventually and continued with the game. Fox contracted French company Visiware as developer; with the film on hold, the creators developed their own story inspired by Boulle's novel and the original films. The game is an action-adventure in which the player controls astronaut Ulysses after he crashes on the Planet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apes.</b> The game was developed for PC and PlayStation.|$|E
40|$|Miscibility and intermol. {{interactions}} of novel blends of poly(N-vinyl- 2 -pyrrolidone) (PVP) and acid functional polyester resins (APE) were studied {{by use of}} Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform IR (ATR-FTIR), Cross-Polarization Magic Angle Spinning (CPMAS) 13 C NMR spectroscopy and 1 H NMR relaxometry. The miscibility {{is found to be}} correlated to <b>the</b> no. <b>of</b> acid end groups (acid value, AV) <b>of</b> <b>APE</b> and <b>the</b> molar mass (M) of PVP. Blends of APE with high AV and PVP with high M exhibit single-phase behavior in DSC and 1 H NMR. Both ATR-FTIR and 13 C NMR of these blends show compn. -dependent displacements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>APE</b> and PVP signals, which confirms that the two polymers are close together in the blend. In particular, FTIR spectra reveal a systematic blue shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stretch vibrations <b>of</b> both PVP and APE carbonyl groups. This indicates dipole-dipole interactions between a carbonyl group of PVP and a carbonyl <b>of</b> <b>APE.</b> <b>The</b> spectra contain a broad peak at about 1630 cm- 1, which appears as a shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carbonyl stretch vibration of PVP. This band is ascribed to hydrogen bonding between <b>the</b> carbonyls <b>of</b> PVP and <b>the</b> hydrogen atoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end groups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>APE</b> resins.

40|$|Why would Ben Jonson want {{to portray}} Volpone {{as having a}} dwarf called Nano? What is <b>the</b> {{significance}} <b>of</b> reading <b>the</b> dwarf as a comic figure? Through <b>the</b> discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ape</b> as an anamorphic figure (as an image of distortion and deformity, constantly changing shape, as well as challenging the reader 2 ̆ 7 s perspective), this article argues that the dwarf is an important character in the play {{as it can be}} related to ideas such as imitation, death, castration, and <b>the</b> Lacanian concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gaze.
