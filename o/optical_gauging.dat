We evaluated the trackability, flexibility, and conformability of 17 coronary stents using specific mechanical bench tests. The quantifications used a dynamometer for assessment of trackability (maximal strength) and flexibility (stiffness) and a 3 D <b>optical</b> <b>gauging</b> machine for assessment of conformability (distance between stent and arterial wall in a curvature). The maximal strength (measuring the trackability) ranged respectively from 0. 24 ± 0. 06 and 0. 38 ± 0. 03 N (Seaquest) to 1. 31 ± 0. 42 and 1. 34 ± 0. 35 N (Carbostent), concerning respectively curvatures of 90 ° (P < 0. 0001) and 135 ° (P < 0. 0001). The stiffness (measuring the flexibility) ranged from 0. 53 ± 0. 16 (Seaquest) to 1. 28 ± 0. 10 N/mm (NIR Royal; P < 0. 0001).

This was done {{as a means of}} detecting any calibration changes that might have occurred while deployed. Although it was known that the artificial rain in the simulator did not contain the required exponential distribution for accurate <b>optical</b> rain <b>gauge</b> rate measurements, use of the facility was necessary {{because it was the only}} means available for taking controlled observations with instruments that were received, tested, and shipped out in groups over a period of months.

40|$|The <b>optical</b> rain <b>gauge</b> (ORG) by ScTI is {{designed}} to be tolerant to reduction of infrared beam intensity due to a dirty lens. Recently there is interest in long term use of <b>optical</b> <b>gauges</b> onboard buoys at sea. Because of logistics, these systems are serviced infrequently, i. e., every several months. Due to the proximity of the gauges to the sea surface, salt can be expected to be deposited on the lens. To obtain an indication of the potential for dirty lens to affect the ORG calibration, two simple experiments were conducted. In the control experiment, a sample ORG was compared to three other ORG's during natural rain events. Next a translucent mask was placed on the transmitter lens of the sample ORG and again data were collected under natural rain conditions. The mask reduced the gain of the perturbed ORG by about 30 %. The perturbed ORG operated rather well in that the mask only causes a change in the gain and does not cause data drop out at low rain rates. However, the reduced gain would seriously impact an assessment of rain statistics...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} {{studies show}} {{the possibility of}} generating <b>optical</b> <b>gauge</b> potentials in neutral atoms using laser beams carrying orbital angular momentum. This is interesting {{not only because the}} gauge field is related to a variety of important quantum phenomena in physics, such as the Aharonov-Bohm effect, geometric phases, and the quantum Hall effect, but also {{due to the fact that}} a vector-potential type of interaction on the center of mass of neutral atoms cannot be achieved directly by applying a magnetic field. With the versatility of cold atomic systems and advanced experimental techniques available in atomic and optical physics, the generation of gauge fields in neutral atoms makes cold atomic systems an ideal playground for investigating numerous single- or many-body effects related to magnetic fields. In this thesis, we study optically generated gauge potentials and their effects in cold atoms. We show that gauge potentials well known in condensed matter physics, such as the “flux tube” magnetic field and the quasi-constant magnetic field, can be generated by two Laguerre-Gaussian beams. The “flux tube” magnetic field can be used to engineer both the phase and amplitude pattern of atomic wave functions, and drive atoms to a vortex state or a non-vortex state determined by its flux. Especially, with wisely chosen trapping potential and laser parameters, the atomic wave function is identical to phasor amplitude of the Laguerre-Gaussian beams. This is a remarkable result since all information of the optical modes is fully stored in the atomic wave, hence providing a possible means for storage of quantum qubits. Another intriguing application of these <b>optical</b> <b>gauge</b> potentials is spin current generation. We show that a persistent spin current, a static spin accumulation, and the atomic spin Hall effect, can all be generated in cold atoms...|$|R

40|$|Three <b>optical</b> <b>gauges</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} for guiding the assembly and measuring precisely the reflecting surfaces of a compound mirror that comprises a corner-cube retroreflector glued in a hole on a flat mirror. In the specific application for which the gauges were developed, the compound mirror is part of a siderostat in a stellar interferometer. The flat-mirror portion of the compound mirror is the siderostat mirror; the retroreflector portion of the compound mirror is to be used, during operation of the interferometer, to monitor the location of the siderostat mirror surface relative to other optical surfaces of the interferometer. Nominally, the optical corner of the retroreflector should lie precisely on the siderostat mirror surface, but this precision cannot be achieved in fabrication: in practice, there remains some distance between the optical corner and the siderostat mirror surface. For proper operation of the interferometer, it is required to make this distance as small as possible and to know this distance within 1 nm. The three gauges make it possible to satisfy these requirements...|$|R

A complete set of experimental data has been obtained by Clowes [4] on insulin and protamine. He studied the effects of pH and time of exposure on the thickness of layers of protamine and insulin adsorbed onto slides covered with barium stearate and conditioned with uranyl acetate. He found that the pH was responsible for large variations in the thickness of the adsorbed layers and that the thickness of insulin layers adsorbed onto a protamine base was dependent on the concentration of the insulin.

40|$|Empirical {{studies using}} {{satellite}} data and radiosondes {{have shown that}} precipitation increases with column water vapor (CWV) in the tropics, and that this increase is much steeper above some critical CWV value. Here, eight years of 1 -min-resolution microwave radiometer and <b>optical</b> <b>gauge</b> data at Nauru Island are analyzed {{to better understand the}} relationships among CWV, column liquid water (CLW), and precipitation at small time scales. CWV is found to have large autocorrelation times compared with CLW and precipitation. Before precipitation events, CWV increases on both a synoptic-scale time period and a subsequent shorter time period consistent with mesoscale convective activity; the latter period is associated with the highest CWV levels. Probabilities of precipitation increase greatly with CWV. Given initial high CWV, this increased probability of precipitation persists at least 10 – 12 h. Even in periods of high CWV, however, probabilities of initial precipitation in a 5 -min period remain low enough that there tends to be a lag {{before the start of the}} next precipitation event. This is consistent with precipitation occurring stochastically within environments containing high CWV, with the latter being established by a combination of synoptic-scale and mesoscale forcing...|$|R

All the spectra have a similar shape, with a maximum near 5 Hz, and with a more rapid decay towards higher frequencies than towards lower frequencies.
