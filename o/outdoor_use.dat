5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited for <b>outdoor</b> <b>use</b> such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E
5|$|The true {{number of}} cases of carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning is unknown, since many non-lethal exposures go undetected. From the available data, carbon monoxide poisoning is {{the most common cause of}} injury and death due to poisoning worldwide. Poisoning is typically more common during the winter months. This is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces, gas or kerosene space heaters, and kitchen stoves during the winter months, which if faulty and/or used without adequate ventilation, may produce excessive carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide detection and poisoning also increases during power outages, when electric heating and cooking appliances become inoperative and residents may temporarily resort to fuel-burning space heaters, stoves, and grills (some of which are safe only for <b>outdoor</b> <b>use</b> but nonetheless are errantly burned indoors).|$|E

25|$|The {{enhanced}} performance {{may arise from}} a decrease in solvent permeation across the sealant due to {{the application of the}} polymer gel electrolyte. The polymer gel electrolyte is quasi-solid at room temperature, and becomes a viscous liquid (viscosity: 4.34 mPa·s) at 80°C compared with the traditional liquid electrolyte (viscosity: 0.91 mPa·s). The much improved stabilities of the device under both thermal stress and soaking with light has never before been seen in DSCs, and they match the durability criteria applied to solar cells for <b>outdoor</b> <b>use,</b> which makes these devices viable for practical application.|$|E

25|$|Maintenance of {{the eternal}} flame is an ongoing issue. Arlington National Cemetery experts said in 2001 that it cost about $200 a month to keep the flame burning. As of 2010, Fenwal Controls, a gas {{equipment}} manufacturer based in Boston, was the contractor responsible for maintaining the flame. The eternal flame's original, custom-manufactured ignition system was contained in a weather-proof box buried {{a few feet from}} the grave site. The system controlled the flow of gas and oxygen to the flame and kept it lit via a high-voltage cable and 20,000-volt spark ignition electrode near the gas burner. No longer constantly sparking to keep the flame lit, the system monitored the flame and activated the ignition system only when the flame was extinguished. The electrode was specially designed for <b>outdoor</b> <b>use.</b> Oversight of the flame's maintenance was provided by the Army Corps of Engineers, which contracted with Fenwal Controls to ensure the eternal flame was maintained and upgraded as needed. According to Arlington National Cemetery historian Tom Sherlock, when the gas burner required maintenance the flame was shut off. But maintenance needs were so minimal that no living Fenwal Controls employee had seen the interior of the ignition system. An on-site visit was planned by Fenwal Controls for early 2010 to inspect the eternal flame and conduct a review of the ignition and burner systems.|$|E

40|$|Wood has a {{long history}} of use in {{familiar}} products, and even now wood is the staple material for buildings and furniture. Recently, new applications of wood have been decks, garden furniture, house fences, play equipment, boardwalks, and signboards. Wood products are also widely used in public construction works on river and roads such as bridges, sound-insulating fence, and guard-rail. The increase in the <b>outdoor</b> <b>uses</b> of wood products arises from their warmth and amenity properties, good design characteristics and natural harmony with the surrounding scenery. The environmental friendliness of wood is due to its renewability as a natural resource, to the low energy consumption in processing, and because it is easy to recycle or dispose. As proven by Horyuji Temple in Japan, which is the oldest wooden structure in the world, wood is almost an everlasting material. However, exterior wood, wood for <b>outdoor</b> <b>uses</b> is always exposed to weathering such as light or rainfall, and to biological deterioration by decay fungi or termites. For high-performance utilization of exterior wood products, not only structural reliability, but also durability and weathering resistance are highly required. We are conducting the research projects on the high-performance utilization of wood for <b>outdoor</b> <b>uses,</b> which are the characterization of the wood surfaces exposed to sunshine and rainfall, the non-destructive detection of decay and insect attacks in wood, the development of maintenance system to provide the long-life to wood, and so on.
