6000|$|We {{had written}} for a boat—a double {{sculling}} skiff; {{and when we}} went down with <b>our</b> <b>bags</b> to the yard, and gave our names, the man said: ...|$|E
60|$|And so Tom awoke, and we {{rose in the}} dark, And got with <b>our</b> <b>bags</b> and our brushes to work. Though {{the morning}} was cold, Tom was happy and warm: So, if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.|$|E
60|$|Not seldom in this life, when, on {{the right}} side, fortune's {{favorites}} sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the rushing breeze, and joyfully feel <b>our</b> <b>bagging</b> sails fill out. So seemed it with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor, whales were seen and four were slain; {{and one of them}} by Ahab.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} much on underneath, Roger; and your bareness, in such weather as this, {{would be as}} {{noticeable}} as your gown. Mind, before it gets light, get the ladies up, and carry <b>our</b> <b>bag</b> of victuals and the water skin over the crest. You may be sure that, {{as soon as it}} is light, there will be many sharp eyes watching the hillside, all along here." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{felt about}} in the small {{enclosure}} round the house, and gathered juniper and birch-twigs, and kindled a fire upon the open stove built {{in the corner of}} the room. Fortunately, we had some dried reindeer and bread in <b>our</b> <b>bag,</b> and on that and the ryper and the contents of our flasks we supped. Afterwards, to while away the time, we made an inspection of the strange eyrie we had lighted on.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} may as well leave <b>our</b> <b>bags</b> on check at this depot and look around here," [...] was the answer. [...] "Tom started from here and maybe we'll be lucky enough to meet {{somebody}} who saw and remembered him." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{tall man}} had {{stepped from the}} shadow of the porch to open the door of the wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow light of the hall. She came out and helped the man to hand down <b>our</b> <b>bags.</b>|$|E

60|$|On inquiry, {{we found}} that the head men resided at the other Gani on the western side of the peninsula, and it was {{necessary}} to send messengers across (about half a day's journey) to inform them of my arrival, and to beg them to assist me. I then succeeded in buying a little sago, some dried deer-meat and cocoa-nuts, which at once relieved our immediate want of something to eat. At night we found <b>our</b> <b>bag</b> of atones still held us very well, and we slept tranquilly.|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{we had all}} the {{pheasants}} that {{we think}} fall dead <b>our</b> <b>bags</b> would be much bigger than they are," [...] remarked Van Koop, with a look of great relief upon his face, adding in his horrid, patronizing way: [...] "Still, you shot uncommonly well, Quatermain. I'd no idea you would run me so close." ...|$|E
60|$|Towards mid-day, {{on looking}} out, we see two tiny spires {{standing}} {{side by side}} against the sky. They seem to be twins, and grow taller as we approach. I describe them to B., and he says they are the steeples of Cologne Cathedral; and we all begin to yawn and stretch, and to collect <b>our</b> <b>bags</b> and coats and umbrellas.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present an}} Alzheimer’s {{detection}} study {{based on a}} global shape description of hippocampal surface models. With global descriptors forming <b>our</b> <b>bag</b> of features, Support Vector Machine classification of 49 Alzheimer(AD) and 63 elderly control subjects yielded 75. 5 % sensitivity and 87. 3 % specificity with 82. 1 % correct overall in a leave-one-out test. We show that our description contributes new information to simpler shape measures. Armed with a rigid shape registration tool, we also present a way to visualize variation in global shape description as a local displacement map, thus clarifying the descriptors’ anatomical meaning.

6000|$|TRIP. Why yes--here {{are three}} or four of us pass our time agreeably enough--but then our wages are {{sometimes}} a little in arrear--and not very great either--but fifty Pounds a year and find <b>our</b> own <b>Bags</b> and Bouquets---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hang it!" [...] he cried; [...] "I'm {{worse off}} than ever; let me have some breakfast!" [...] We lowered <b>our</b> slender <b>bag</b> of ship-stores from a rafter, and handed him a biscuit. While this was being munched, he went on and told us his story.|$|R
60|$|We {{lay there}} seven hours, to deliver and {{exchange}} the mails. At length, having collected all <b>our</b> <b>bags</b> {{and all our}} passengers (including two or three choice spirits, who, having indulged too freely in oysters and champagne, were found lying insensible on their backs in unfrequented streets), the engines were again put in motion, and we stood off for Boston.|$|E
6000|$|... "We do {{not belong}} to the Mahdi," [...] Ben Ibyn said, [...] "but are {{peaceful}} travellers. We desire only to fill <b>our</b> <b>bags</b> with grain for the animals, for which we will pay you the full value. For ourselves we need nothing, although, if you have peradventure a kid or a sheep left among you we will gladly purchase it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When all our {{horses were}} saddled up, the word 'on packs' was given. Dr. Mueller and I {{used to work}} together, and had our packs laid out in pairs; so that when each horse was led between his bags, we hooked them on at the same moment. When we halted, we laid <b>our</b> <b>bags</b> {{on a couple of}} poles, to keep them from the ground, as in the drawing.|$|E
6000|$|... "We could if we {{were sure}} {{we were going to}} return this way," [...] {{answered}} Jack. [...] "But we had better take them along, for we may return to the Hall by an entirely different route. We'll place our skates in <b>our</b> game <b>bags</b> for the present;" [...] and this advice was followed.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for density estimation using Bayesian networks when faced with scarce and partially observed data. Our approach relies on Efron’s bootstrap framework, and replaces the standard model selection score by a bootstrap aggregation objective aimed at sifting out bad decisions during the learning procedure. Unlike previous bootstrap or MCMC based approaches that are only aimed at recovering specific structural features, we learn a concrete density model {{that can be used}} for probabilistic generalization. To make use of our objective when some of the data is missing, we propose a bagged structural EM procedure that does not incur the heavy computational cost typically associated with a bootstrap-based approach. We compare <b>our</b> <b>bagged</b> objective to the Bayesian score and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), as well as other bootstrap-based model selection objectives, and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving generalization performance for varied real-life datasets. ...|$|R

6000|$|Then I quietly, but firmly, {{take the}} book away from him, and dress him for going out; {{and we take}} <b>our</b> <b>bags</b> and walk to the station, and tell a porter that, [...] "Please, {{we want to go}} to Heidelberg." [...] And the porter takes us one by each hand, and leads us to a seat and tells us to sit there and be good, and that, when it is time, he will come and fetch us and put us in the train; and this he does.|$|E
60|$|We are late. It is {{a quarter}} to twelve. And I {{have to go out}} and change money, and I hope to find my two friends.--The q-b and I dash down the platform--no friends at the barrier. The station {{moderately}} empty. We bolt across to the departure platforms. The Naples train stands ready. In we pitch <b>our</b> <b>bags,</b> ask a naval man not to let anyone steal them, then I fly out into town while the q-b buys food and wine at the buffet.|$|E
6000|$|No {{sooner had}} the porter left us than we both {{stretched}} out on the bed, in such relief and ecstasy of returning confidence as only weary youth and honest poverty can know.--It was heavenly sweet, this sense of safety in the heart of a tempest of human passion but as we rested, our hunger to explore returned. [...] "Time is passing. We shall probably never see New York again," [...] I argued, [...] "and besides <b>our</b> <b>bags</b> are now safely cached. Let's go out and see how the city looks by night." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dodd was in {{only four}} {{theatrical}} movies. She first {{appeared as a}} beautician in Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958) starring James Stewart and Kim Novak. She also appeared as Mrs. Rigg in What's the Matter with Helen? (1971), which was written by her husband, writer Henry Farrell, and starred Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters. [...] In 1965, Dodd and actor/writer Robert Lansing formed the State Repertory Theatre as a rallying ground for professional actors who wanted to do plays {{outside the realm of}} commercial theatre. They did various productions - Spoon River Anthology, a concert titled From <b>Our</b> <b>Bag,</b> Pirandello's As You Desire Me, and a double-bill titled Those Mad Victorians, which the company took to Caltech in the late 1960s. When they returned to Caltech the following season, they performed An Evening With Oscar Wilde, a concert reading based on Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray and The House of Pomegranates, with Dodd as one of the players.|$|R
60|$|By getting ashore {{half a mile}} {{above the}} creek, there was a farm-road {{that would lead to}} the house by a cut so short, as nearly to bring us there as soon as Neb could {{possibly}} arrive with his dire, but false intelligence. The place was pointed out to the captain, who had extracted our secret from us, and who good-naturedly consented to do all we asked of him. I do think he would have gone into the creek itself, had it been required. But we were landed, with <b>our</b> <b>bag</b> of clothes--one answered very well for both--at the place I have mentioned, and, taking turn about to shoulder the wardrobe, away we went, as fast as legs could carry us. Even Rupert seemed to feel on this occasion, and I do think he had a good deal of contrition, as he must have recollected the pain he had occasioned his excellent father, and dear, good sister.|$|R

60|$|So {{here was}} the explanation. We were in a honeymoon district, in June--the most popular month in the whole year for marriage. Every {{two out of three}} couples found {{wandering}} about the New Forest in June are honeymoon couples; the third are going to be. When they travel anywhere it is to the Isle of Wight. We both had on new clothes. <b>Our</b> <b>bags</b> happened to be new. By some evil chance our very umbrellas were new. Our united ages were thirty-seven. The wonder would have been had we NOT been mistaken for a young married couple.|$|E
60|$|The canoes {{were carried}} into the boat-house; they were washed down for {{us by the}} Club servants, the sails were hung out to dry, and {{everything}} made as snug and tidy as a picture. And in the meanwhile we were led upstairs by our new-found brethren, for so {{more than one of}} them stated the relationship, and made free of their lavatory. This one lent us soap, that one a towel, a third and fourth helped us to undo <b>our</b> <b>bags.</b> And all the time such questions, such assurances of respect and sympathy! I declare I never knew what glory was before.|$|E
60|$|Now it is {{sometimes}} {{the case that the}} birds of which I write are so tame that they will sit still on a tree till they are all shot, one by one, if only the hunter is careful to fire at the lowest bird first, and so proceed upwards. If he should kill the top bird first, its fluttering fall disturbs the rest, causing them to take wing. Fully aware of this fact, Big Otter and I fired alternate shots, and in a few seconds brought down the whole covey. This quite filled one of <b>our</b> <b>bags.</b>|$|E
40|$|We study resource-limited online learning, {{motivated}} by the problem of conditional-branch outcome prediction in computer architecture. In particular, we consider (parallel) time and spaceefficient ensemble learners for online settings, empirically demonstrating benefits similar to those shown previously for offline ensembles. Our learning algorithms are inspired by the previously published “boosting by filtering ” framework {{as well as the}} offline Arc-x 4 boosting-style algorithm. We train ensembles of online decision trees using a novel variant of the ID 4 online decision-tree algorithm as the base learner (our ID 4 extensions significantly improve ID 4 performance), and show empirical results for both boosting and bagging-style online ensemble methods. Our results evaluate these methods on both our branch prediction domain and online variants of three familiar machine-learning benchmarks. The results indicate poor performance for <b>our</b> <b>bagging</b> algorithm, but significant improvements in predictive accuracy with ensemble size for our boosting-style algorithm. In addition, we show that given tight space constraints, ensembles of depth-bounded trees are often a better use of space than single deeper trees. 1...|$|R

60|$|Doubtless {{the true}} story of how I entered Manhattan will endanger my social position, but as an unflinching realist, I must begin by {{acknowledging}} that I left the Hudson River boat carrying my own luggage. I shudder to think what we two boys must have looked like as we set off, side by side, prospecting for Union Square and the Bowery. Broadway, we knew, was the main street and Union Square the center of the island, therefore we turned north and paced along the pavement, still clamped to <b>our</b> everlasting <b>bags.</b>|$|R
