5|$|The goddess {{carries her}} own severed head– {{sometimes}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> or in a skull-bowl– {{in her left}} hand. Though no legend mentions a specific weapon for the beheading, she holds a scimitar, a knife or a scissor-like object in her right hand. Though generally depicted with two arms, manifestations of the goddess with four arms also exist. While her own severed head and the sword appear in two of her hands, the implements in the remaining arms vary: a scissor-like object, a skull-bowl collecting the dripping blood from her head or blood stream from her neck, or a severed head, sometimes identified {{as that of the}} god Brahma.|$|E

25|$|According to ten {{verses of}} , John was imprisoned for criticizing King Herod Antipas's {{marriage}} to Herodias, the former wife of Antipas's half-brother Herod II. Herod offered his niece a reward of her choice for performing a dance for his guests on his birthday. Herodias persuaded {{her daughter to}} ask for John the Baptist's head <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>platter.</b> Against his better judgment, Herod reluctantly acceded to her request.|$|E
25|$|The Festival of Herod II {{stands out}} among the scenic representations. The fresco shows the king on his throne, {{pointing}} at his wife, Herodias, as she presents him {{with the head of}} John the Baptist <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>platter.</b> Further scenes show the Miracles of Jesus, the Resurrection, and the birth and death of the Virgin Mary. All these paintings are outstanding due to their lively expression and harmonious colouration.|$|E
25|$|Strauss {{wrote the}} opera's libretto, {{in the process}} cutting almost half of Wilde's play, {{stripping}} it down and emphasizing its basic dramatic structure. The structural form of Strauss's libretto is highly patterned, notably {{in the use of}} symmetry and the hierarchical grouping of events, passages, and sections in threes. Examples of three-part structure include Salome's attempt to seduce Narraboth, in order to get him to let her see Jochanaan. She tries to seduce him three times, and he capitulates on the third. When Jochanaan is brought before Salome he issues three prophecies, after which Salome professes love for Jochanaan three times—love of his skin, his hair, and his lips, the last of which results in Jochanaan cursing her. In the following scene Herod three times asks Salome to be with him—to drink, eat, and sit with him. She refuses each time. Later Herod asks her to dance for him, again three times. Twice she refuses, but the third time Herod swears to give her whatever she wants in return and she accepts. After she dances and says she wants Jochanaan's head <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>platter,</b> Herod, not wanting to execute the Prophet, makes three offers—an emerald, peacocks, and finally, desperately, the Veil of the Sanctuary of the Holy of Holies. Salome rejects all three offers, each time more stridently insisting on Jochanaan's head. Three-part groupings occur elsewhere on both larger and smaller levels.|$|E

500|$|Emperor Han Wudi was a superstitious man, and {{believed}} that he could attain good health and immortality through spiritual means.

500|$|Justin Chang of Variety wrote Iñárritu [...] "increasingly succumbs {{to the air}} of grim overdetermination {{that has}} marred much of [...] past work" [...] and it was [...] "an {{imposing}} vision... but also an inflated and emotionally stunted one." [...] Stephanie Zacharek, writing for TIME magazine, gave a positive review to the film stating: [...] "Inarritu may have fashioned The Revenant as the ultimate endurance test, but as Glass, DiCaprio simply endures. He gives the movie a beating heart, offering it up, figuratively speaking, alive and bloody <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>platter.</b> It—he—is the most visceral effect in the movie: revenge served warm. Bon Appetite." [...] Richard Brody of The New Yorker was critical of the film, and said that Emmanuel Lubezki's images were mere [...] "pictorial ornament to [...] bland theatrical stagings.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{composition}} of the scene juxtaposes the prim and proper Huguenot man and his immaculately dressed wife and son with these three, as they form their own [...] "family group" [...] across {{the other side of}} the gutter. The head of John the Baptist <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> is the advertisement for the pie shop, proclaiming [...] "Good eating". Below this sign are the embracing couple, extending the metaphor of good eating beyond a mere plate of food, and still further down the street girl greedily scoops up the pie, carrying the theme to the foot of the picture. I. R. F. Gordon sees the vertical line of toppling plates from the top window downwards as a symbol of the disorder on this side of the street. The man reduced to a head on the sign, in what is assumed to be the woman's fantasy, is mirrored by the [...] "Good Woman" [...] pictured on the board behind who has only a body, her nagging head removed to create the man's ideal of a [...] "good woman". In the top window of the [...] "Good Woman", a woman throws a plate with a leg of meat into the street as she argues, providing a stark contrast to the [...] "good" [...] woman pictured on the sign below. Ronald Paulson sees the kite hanging from the church as part of a trinity of signs; the kite indicating the purpose of the church, an ascent into heaven, just as the other signs for [...] "Good Eating" [...] and the [...] "Good Woman" [...] indicate the predilections of those on that side of the street; but he also notes it as another nod to the pastoral tradition: here instead of soaring above the fields it hangs impotently on the church wall.|$|E

2500|$|Flemish waffles, or Gaufres à la Flamande, are a {{specialty}} of northern France and portions of western Belgium. The original recipe, published in 1740 by Louis-Auguste de Bourbon in Le Cuisinier Gascon, is as follows: Take [...] "deux litrons" [...] (1.7 liters or 7 cups) of flour and mix it {{in a bowl}} with salt and one ounce of brewer's yeast barm. Moisten it completely with warm milk. Then whisk fifteen egg whites and add that to the mixture, stirring continuously. Incorporate [...] "un livre" [...] (490 grams or 1.1 pounds) of fresh butter, and let the batter rise. Once the batter has risen, take your heated iron, made expressly for these waffles, and wrap some butter in a cloth and rub {{both sides of the}} iron with it. When the iron is completely heated, make your waffles, but do so gently for fear of burning them. Cooked, take them out, put them <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>platter,</b> and serve them with both sugar and orange blossom water on top.|$|E
2500|$|Reading the words, [...] "love the stranger, {{in giving}} him food and {{clothing}}," [...] in [...] Akilas the proselyte asked Rabbi Eliezer whether {{food and clothing}} constituted all the benefit of conversion to Judaism. Rabbi Eliezer replied that food and clothing are no small things, for in [...] Jacob prayed to God for [...] "bread to eat, and clothing to put on," [...] while God comes and offers it to the convert <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>platter.</b> Akilas then visited Rabbi Joshua, who taught that [...] "bread" [...] refers to the Torah (as in [...] Wisdom – the Torah – says, [...] "Come, eat of my bread") while [...] "clothing" [...] means the Torah scholar's cloak. A person privileged to study the Torah is thus privileged to perform God's precepts. Moreover, converts' daughters could marry into the priesthood, so that their descendants could offer burnt-offerings on the altar. The Midrash offered another interpretation: [...] "Bread" [...] refers to the showbread, while [...] "clothing" [...] refers to the priestly vestments. The Midrash offered yet another interpretation: [...] "Bread" [...] refers to challah, while [...] "clothing" [...] refers to the first shearings of the sheep, both of which belong to the priests.|$|E

2500|$|By September 1943, Disney {{assigned}} Dick Huemer and Joe Grant {{to begin}} work on Cinderella as story supervisors and given a preliminary budget of $1 million. However, by 1945, their preliminary story work was halted. During the writing stages of Song of the South, Dalton S. Reymond and Maurice Rapf entered into a personal dispute, in which Raft was reassigned to write for Cinderella. In his version, Cinderella was written to be a less passive character than Snow White, and more rebellious against her stepfamily. Raft explained, [...] "My thinking was you can't have somebody who comes in and changes everything for you. You can't be delivered it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>platter.</b> You've got to earn it. So in my version, the Fairy Godmother said, 'It's okay till midnight but from then in it's up to you.' I made her earn it, and {{what she had to}} do achieve it was to rebel against her stepmother and stepsisters, to stop being a slave in her own home. So I had a scene where they're ordering her around and she throws the stuff back at them. She revolts, so they lock her up in the attic. I don't think anyone took (my idea) very seriously." ...|$|E
