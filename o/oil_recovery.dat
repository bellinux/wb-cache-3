In Saganoseki, a {{motorist}} died after a roadway collapse landed his vehicle {{in a nearby}} river. On Shikoku, Zeb destroyed roads and farmlands and eroded lands along waterways. Three people died due to a landslide in Matsuyama. In Okayama Prefecture along Honshu, Zeb left six people missing or killed and was the costliest typhoon since Typhoon Fran in 1976. Landslides killed three people in Hiroshima Prefecture. Power outages and landslides affected much of Honshu, while strong winds damaged many fields. A cargo freighter washed aground amid high waves in Shizuoka Prefecture, causing oil to leak and requiring assistance from the Coast Guard; <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> equipment {{was sent to the}} area to clean the spill. Lastly, Zeb affected the northern island of Hokkaido, causing one landslide, damaging 152buildings, and knocking 152,000apples to the ground. Nationwide, Zeb destroyed 770homes and flooded another 12,548, with thousands forced to evacuate their homes due to flooding. Overall, there were 14deaths and 67injuries, with damage estimated at $335.5million (1998USD).|$|E

40|$|The {{wettability}} {{behavior of}} the matrix block {{is one of the}} major factors controlling the effectiveness of the employed EOR methods in NFRs. Water injection in NFRs with mixed-wet or effectively oil-wet matrix blocks usually results in low <b>oil</b> <b>recoveries.</b> In this case, gas injection is considered to be an alternative process, where the process benefits from the gravity forces and the process is called gas-oil gravity drainage. In this study, the effect of matrix wettability on the efficiency of gravity drainage by CO 2 injection is addressed. Laboratory experiments and numerical simulation were performed to analyze the process under different wettability conditions of the matrix. It is concluded that for a system with an effectively oil-wet matrix, water is the most non-wetting phase while CO 2 is the intermediate-wetting phase. In the three phase setting, which includes carbon dioxide, this is considered favorable for oil production. However, with a strongly water-wet matrix, CO 2 is always the least wetting phase. For this condition, it turns out that when water is displaced by the gravity drainage process part of the oil is also produced. It is observed that higher <b>oil</b> <b>recoveries</b> are achieved by CO 2 injection in an oil-wet matrix block. Geoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the largest}} oil {{reserves}} {{in the world is}} not in the Middle East or in Alaska, but in Canada. This fuel exists in the form of bitumen in Alberta's oil sands. While it takes a tremendous amount of energy to recover this bitumen and refine it into petroleum products, with oil prices nearing all time highs, it is profitable to do so. <b>Oil</b> sands <b>recovery</b> involves either strip mining the sands and extracting the oil, or pumping large quantities of steam into the ground in order to free the bitumen from the sand.

25|$|In 2011, a {{provision}} {{was added to}} the LCFS that allows refiners to receive credits for the deployment of innovative crude production technologies, such as carbon capture and sequestration or solar steam generation. Solar thermal enhanced <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> is a form of enhanced <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> (EOR), which is key to harvesting California’s heavy crude. Currently, California uses EOR to help produce about 60% of its crude output. By using solar power instead of natural gas to create steam for EOR, solar steam generation reduces the amount of emissions produced during oil extraction, thus lowering the overall carbon intensity of crude. California currently has two solar EOR projects in operation, one in McKittrick, operated by LINN Energy (formerly Berry Petroleum) using enclosed trough technology from GlassPoint Solar, and another in Coalinga operated by Chevron Corporation using BrightSource Energy power tower technology. CARB is currently considering an amendment to allow upstream operators to receive credits for deploying innovative crude production technologies.|$|E

40|$|Utilizing {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) for stabilizing CO 2 -foams {{has recently}} become an interesting subject among petroleum engineers. It {{has been proven}} that silica (SiO 2) NP is a good agent for stabilizing CO 2 -foams. Investigating the role {{of other types of}} NPs is ongoing and this research attempted to determine and compare the effects of three hydrophilic metal oxide NPs, namely aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3), titanium dioxide (TiO 2), copper oxide (CuO) as well as the effect of SiO 2 on the stability of CO 2 -foams. For this aim, the listed NPs in concentrations from 0. 002 to 0. 1 wt% were dispersed in de-ionized water to make suspensions. These suspensions were utilized in a chromatography column to produce foam. The stability of the generated NPs-CO 2 -foams was determined by measuring the half-life time. The results revealed that the highest stability of NPs-CO 2 -foams was reached at an optimum concentration of 0. 008 wt% for all NP types. Moreover, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, and CuO NPs-CO 2 foams half-life times were obtained 28. 1, 24. 6, 20. 1, and 17. 9 min, respectively. In addition, the applicability of generated NPs-CO 2 foams on oil displacement through quartz sand porous media was determined.
