40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a cost-effectiveness study concerning the effects of an <b>overtaking</b> prohibition on two lane rural roads. <b>Overtaking</b> prohibitions are being implemented in the Netherlands aiming to improve safety. <b>Overtaking</b> frequency on road sections with and without <b>overtaking</b> prohibition are measured by means of camera observations <b>Overtaking</b> frequencies were determined by comparing the order of vehicles at the start and end of a road segment without junctions. <b>Overtaking</b> actions were assessed by means of changes in the order of the vehicles.

It turns out that up to ten percent of drivers performs <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvres on normal road sections. On sections with prohibition, about one percent of drivers disobey this traffic rule. Additionally, a questionnaire was sent to drivers of one of the observed roads, with questions about the <b>overtaking</b> prohibition. 28 percent {{of the respondents indicated that}} they will not always comply with an overidable <b>overtaking</b> prohibition.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the UK Department of Transport's Highway Link Design (HLD) guidelines for single carriageway roads was to develop layouts, making it clear to drivers where <b>overtaking</b> is possible and where it is undesirable. This paper presents recent <b>overtaking</b> data, and reassesses the <b>overtaking</b> sight distances specified in HLD. Data were collected on a 1175 m <b>overtaking</b> section, forming part of a 7. 3 m wide standard single carriageway with a design speed of 80 kph; the section was almost straight and level. For each <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvre, many parameters of <b>overtaking</b> behaviour were measured from video recordings; the 30 hours of recorded data provided 1143 <b>overtaking</b> manouevres of different types. It was found that the HLD values for full <b>overtaking</b> sight distance (FOSD) and abort <b>overtaking</b> sight distance (ASD), for design speeds ranging from 80 kph to 120 kph, were less than the values calculated by applying the observed data to models previously developed by the authors. These methods were substantially different from those used for deriving and calculating the HLD values. The authors consider that the HLD values' apparent underestimates may lead to increased accident risk on <b>overtaking</b> sections, and reduce the efficiency of single carriageway roads, because their <b>overtaking</b> sections provide too few <b>overtaking</b> opportunities.

40|$|This driving {{simulator}} study investigated how mandatory and voluntary ISA might affect a driver's <b>overtaking</b> decisions on rural roads, by presenting drivers {{with a variety}} of <b>overtaking</b> scenarios designed to evaluate both the frequency and safety of the manoeuvres. In half the <b>overtaking</b> scenarios, ISA was active and in the remainder ISA was switched off. A rural road was modelled with a number of 2 + 1 road sections, thus allowing drivers a protected <b>overtaking</b> opportunity. The results indicate that drivers became less inclined to initiate an <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvre when the mandatory ISA was active and this was particularly so when the <b>overtaking</b> opportunity was short. In addition to this, when ISA was activated drivers {{were more likely to have}} to abandon an <b>overtaking,</b> presumably due to running out of road. They also spent more time in the critical hatched area - a potentially unsafe behaviour. The quality of the <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvre was also affected when mandatory ISA was active, with drivers pulling out and cutting back in more sharply. In contrast, when driving with a voluntary ISA, <b>overtaking</b> behaviour remained mostly unchanged: drivers disengaged the function in approximately 70 % of <b>overtaking</b> scenarios. The results of this study suggest that mandatory ISA could affect the safety of <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvres unless coupled with an adaptation period or other driver support functions that support safe <b>overtaking...</b>|$|R

30|$|In summary, {{the above}} studies {{did not involve}} the minimum time {{handling}} problem while <b>overtaking</b> in a dynamic environment, that is, the lateral and longitudinal safety distances in the minimum time handling problem while <b>overtaking</b> were not considered. The longitudinal safety distance refers {{to the idea that}} the <b>overtaking</b> vehicle should keep a certain distance with the <b>overtaken</b> vehicle during the <b>overtaking</b> process, thereby avoiding traffic accidents such as a rear-end collision. The lateral safety distance refers to the lateral lane constraint, as well as the constraint of the vehicle width variation caused by a roll. The lateral safety distance is used to ensure the vehicle completes the <b>overtaking</b> behavior only within its own lane and the left adjacent lane; this can avoid the scraping of two vehicles owing to variations in body width. Therefore, considering the influence of the longitudinal and lateral safety distances, with the aim of <b>overtaking</b> the front vehicle as quickly as possible, the optimal <b>overtaking</b> trajectory and the shortest <b>overtaking</b> time are figured out using the inverse dynamics method.|$|R

In this paper, based on the traffic rules of driving on the right lane unless <b>overtaking</b> happen, the study first establish the car-following and <b>overtaking</b> model. In car-following model, analyzing the traffic features to obtain the function relationship between the safety distance and speed change; in the <b>overtaking</b> model, TWOPAS stimulation model is adopted to analyze the traffic capacity of highway, and obtain the speed-flow relation graph, <b>overtaking</b> ratio—flow relation scatter graph. It is known through the graph analysis that: (1) when the traffic is sparse, most drivers tend to do free driving with less <b>overtaking,</b> and the traffic rules have no obvious facilitation function on traffic smooth; (2) with the increase of the car flow, the lane becomes narrower, and the <b>overtaking</b> rate decreases continually until it becomes zero. In the process of changing, when the <b>overtaking</b> rate is 4 % 14 % ，, <b>overtaking</b> stimulates the traffic flow; when the <b>overtaking</b> rate is 0 4 % ，, <b>overtaking</b> has a decreasing facilitation effect on traffic flow until it becomes zero.

40|$|Abstract—Overtaking is {{a complex}} and {{hazardous}} driving maneuver for intelligent vehicles. When to initiate <b>overtaking</b> and how to complete <b>overtaking</b> are critical issues for an <b>overtaking</b> intelligent vehicle. We propose an <b>overtaking</b> control method based on the estimation of the conflict probability. This method uses the conflict probability as the safety indicator and completes <b>overtaking</b> by tracking a safe conflict probability. The conflict probability is estimated by the future relative position of intelligent vehicles, and the future relative position is estimated by using the dynamics models of the intelligent vehicles. The proposed method uses model predictive control to track a desired safe conflict probability and synthesizes decision making {{and control of the}} <b>overtaking</b> maneuver. The effectiveness of this method has been validated in different experimental configurations, and the effects of some parameters in this control method have also been investigated.

40|$|At {{the start}} of the 21 st century <b>overtaking</b> on two-lane rural roads is a major traffic safety problem. However, this {{dissertation}} research demonstrates that most drivers are perfectly able to safely perform these manoeuvres. Their time spent in the left lane is about eight seconds. Preparing subtasks of the manoeuvre, such as checking surrounding vehicles' behaviours, changing gear and starting accelerations are started in the right lane. In this way, available <b>overtaking</b> gap in the oncoming traffic stream are optimally used. This anticipative behaviour is accounted for in the proposed <b>overtaking</b> assistant design, which informs the driver about <b>overtaking</b> gaps three seconds before they become available. This system is developed to assist less daring drivers with <b>overtaking</b> and to prevent risk-taking drivers to perform <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvres in unsafe situations. A driving simulator experiment demonstrated that this assistant does not much affect <b>overtaking</b> efficiency, drivers' comfort or safety, as long as the threshold for a safe gap is chosen such that the safety margin with the first oncoming vehicle remains above three seconds. A microscopic traffic simulation study shows that when this threshold is eleven seconds, traffic system efficiency remains similar or increases slightly due to increased number of <b>overtaking</b> manoeuvres. Drivers' safety during <b>overtaking</b> increases, because the time-to-collision with oncoming vehicles will not become smaller than three seconds. And, drivers' comfort is improved in terms of higher <b>overtaking</b> frequencies and less time spent following. To introduce the proposed <b>overtaking</b> assistant to the market, vehicle-to-vehicle communication is necessary. This technology enables vehicles to localise all other surrounding vehicles. The automotive industry works hard on the development of vehicle-to-vehicle communication, however, it will take at least another ten years before the first <b>overtaking</b> assistant as proposed in this dissertation, will become available.
