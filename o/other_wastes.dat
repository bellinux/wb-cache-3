5|$|Horseshoe crabs convert {{nitrogenous}} wastes to ammonia {{and dump}} it via their gills, and excrete <b>other</b> <b>wastes</b> as feces via the anus. They also have nephridia ("little kidneys"), which extract <b>other</b> <b>wastes</b> for excretion as urine. Ammonia is so toxic {{that it must}} be diluted rapidly with large quantities of water. Most terrestrial chelicerates cannot afford to use so much water and therefore convert nitrogenous wastes to other chemicals, which they excrete as dry matter. Extraction is by various combinations of nephridia and Malpighian tubules. The tubules filter wastes out of the blood and dump them into the hindgut as solids, a system that has evolved independently in insects and several groups of arachnids.|$|E
5|$|Rockwell workers mixed {{hazardous}} and <b>other</b> <b>wastes</b> {{with concrete}} to create one-ton solid blocks called pondcrete. These were {{stored in the}} open under tarps on asphalt pads. The pondcrete {{turned out to be}} weak storage, an outcome that had been predicted by Rockwell's own engineers. Relatively unprotected from the elements, the blocks began to leak and sag. Nitrates, cadmium and low-level radioactive waste began to leach into the ground and run downhill toward Walnut Creek and Woman Creek.|$|E
25|$|Old, used {{cutting fluid}} must be {{disposed}} of when it is fetid or chemically degraded and has lost its usefulness. As with used motor oil or <b>other</b> <b>wastes,</b> {{its impact on the}} environment should be mitigated. Legislation and regulation specify how this mitigation should be achieved. Modern cutting fluid disposal involves techniques such as ultrafiltration using polymeric or ceramic membranes which concentrates the suspended and emulsified oil phase.|$|E

25|$|Another {{recently}} developed source of rare earths is electronic waste and <b>other</b> <b>wastes</b> that have significant rare-earth components. New advances in recycling technology have made extraction of rare earths from these materials more feasible, and recycling plants are currently operating in Japan, {{where there is}} an estimated 300,000 tons of rare earths stored in unused electronics. In France, the Rhodia group is setting up two factories, in La Rochelle and Saint-Fons, that will produce 200 tons of rare earths a year from used fluorescent lamps, magnets and batteries.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of urban runoff is on watercourses that historically contained little or no water during dry weather periods (often called ephemeral streams). When an area around such a stream is urbanized, the resultant runoff creates an unnatural year-round streamflow that hurts the vegetation, wildlife and stream bed of the waterway. Containing little or no sediment relative to the historic ratio of sediment to water, urban runoff rushes down the stream channel, ruining natural features such as meanders and sandbars, and creates severe erosion—increasing sediment loads at the mouth while severely incising the stream bed upstream. As an example, on many Southern California beaches {{at the mouth of}} a waterway, urban runoff carries trash, pollutants, excessive silt, and <b>other</b> <b>wastes,</b> and can pose moderate to severe health hazards.|$|E

Chemicals found in limited testing in bay mud and in the old Navy slips include hydrocarbons, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene, and xylene. [...] <b>Other</b> <b>wastes</b> identified include paint, oil, batteries, thinner, adhesives, herbicides, acids, and unknown [...] drums. The two major owners of the filled land in the Potrero are the Port of San Francisco and PG, before selling out to Mirant. The environmental liabilities still belong to PG.|$|E
2500|$|Despite its {{relatively}} short length, the Gowanus Canal was a hub for Brooklyn's maritime and commercial shipping activity. At its busiest, {{as many as}} 100 ships a day transported cargo through the canal. In addition, the industrial sector around the canal grew substantially over time to include stone and coal yards; flour mills; cement works, and manufactured gas plants; tanneries, factories for paint, ink, and soap; machine shops; chemical plants; and sulfur producers, all of which emitted substantial water and airborne pollutants. Chemical fertilizers were manufactured along the canal soon after the Civil War. Coal processing was a dominant industry along the Gowanus Canal since 1869. Coal plants along the upper canal used large amounts {{of water in the}} conversion of coal to coke, liquids and gases. Coal gas was soon used for heating, light, and factory power. Coke was used to make steel. Wastewater and coal tar (now known {{to be a source of}} carcinogens) were dumped back into the canal. [...] Brooklyn's slaughterhouses dumped blood and <b>other</b> <b>wastes</b> in the canals.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{earliest}} days of MGP operations, coal tar was considered a waste and often disposed into the environment in and around the plant locations. While uses for coal tar developed by the late-19th century, the market for tar varied and plants that could not sell tar at a given time could store tar for future use, attempt to burn it as fuel for the boilers, or dump the tar as waste. Commonly, waste tars were disposed of in old gas holders, adits or even mine shafts (if present). Over time, the waste tars degrade with phenols, benzene (and other mono-aromatics – BTEX) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons released as pollutant plumes that can escape into the surrounding environment. <b>Other</b> <b>wastes</b> included [...] "blue billy", which is a ferroferricyanide compound—the blue colour is from Prussian blue, which was commercially used as a dye. Blue billy is typically a granular material and was sometimes sold locally with the strap line [...] "guaranteed weed free drives". The presence of blue billy can give gas works waste a characteristic musty/bitter almonds or marzipan smell which is associated with cyanide gas.|$|E
