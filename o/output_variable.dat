50|$|The Function Block Diagram (FBD) is a {{graphical}} {{language for}} {{programmable logic controller}} design, that can describe the function between input <b>variables</b> and <b>output</b> <b>variables.</b> A function {{is described as a}} set of elementary blocks.

25|$|If {{the input}} {{function}} is in closed-form and the desired output function {{is a series}} of ordered pairs (for example a table of values from which a graph can be generated) over a specified domain, then the Fourier transform can be generated by numerical integration at each value of the Fourier conjugate variable (frequency, for example) for which a value of the <b>output</b> <b>variable</b> is desired. Note that this method requires computing a separate numerical integration for each value of frequency for which a value of the Fourier transform is desired. The numerical integration approach works on a much broader class of functions than the analytic approach, because it yields results for functions that do not have closed form Fourier transform integrals.|$|E
25|$|If {{the input}} {{function}} {{is a series}} of ordered pairs (for example, a time series from measuring an <b>output</b> <b>variable</b> repeatedly over a time interval) then the output function must also be a series of ordered pairs (for example, a complex number vs. frequency over a specified domain of frequencies), unless certain assumptions and approximations are made allowing the output function to be approximated by a closed-form expression. In the general case where the available input series of ordered pairs are assumed be samples representing a continuous function over an interval (amplitude vs. time, for example), the series of ordered pairs representing the desired output function can be obtained by numerical integration of the input data over the available interval at each value of the Fourier conjugate variable (frequency, for example) for which the value of the Fourier transform is desired.|$|E

40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of slice-based software metrics. It brings together information about the development of the metrics from Weiser???s original idea that program slices may be used in the measurement of program complexity, with alternative slice-based measures proposed by other researchers. In particular, it details two aspects of slice-based metric calculation not covered elsewhere in the literature: <b>output</b> <b>variables</b> and worked examples of the calculations. First, <b>output</b> <b>variables</b> are explained, their use explored and standard reference terms and usage proposed. Calculating slice-based metrics requires a clear understanding of ???<b>output</b> <b>variables???</b> because they form the basis for extracting the program slices on which the calculations depend. This report includes a survey of the variation in the definition of <b>output</b> <b>variables</b> used by different research groups and suggests standard terms of reference for these variables. Our study identifies four elements which are combined in the definition of <b>output</b> <b>variables.</b> These are the function return value, modified global variables, modified reference parameters and variables printed or otherwise output by the module. Second, slice-based metric calculations are explained with the aid of worked examples, to assist newcomers to the field. Step-by-step calculations of slice-based cohesion and coupling metrics based on the vertices output by the static analysis tool CodeSurfer (R) are presented and compared with line-based calculations...|$|R
