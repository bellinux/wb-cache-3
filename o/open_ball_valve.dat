50|$|A pig is a {{tool that}} fits closely into the bore of a pipe and is driven along {{the inside of a}} {{pipeline}} by a pressure differential and used to perform a specific task for which it is specially designed. Pigging is done to inspect the bore, scrape off deposits, sediment or corrosion products, or separate two different product batches. Access to the pipeline for inserting or removing pigs must be done by divers when the access point is underwater. The diver may also connect pressure hoses, open and close valves, and monitor progress of the pig past indicator stations. Pigs are designed to pass through fully <b>opened</b> gate and <b>ball</b> <b>valves,</b> and round bends, but the negotiable bend radius depends on the pig design.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{the field}} of competition, all {{companies}} should supply their goods and services with high quality, in shortest period with lower prices than its competitors {{in order to survive}} the competitive environment. A <b>ball</b> <b>valve</b> is a form of quarter-turn valve which uses a hollow, perforated and pivoting ball (called a "floating ball") to control flow through it. It is <b>open</b> when the <b>ball's</b> hole is in line with the flow and closed when it is pivoted 90 -degrees by the valve handle. Reduced flow and excessive pressure drop are some of the common problems in <b>ball</b> <b>valve.</b> Angle backlash in the ball position is one of the causes for reduced flow and excessive pressure drop. This paper discusses on creating various alternatives for eliminating the angle backlash in the ball position, evaluating them and choosing the best alternative followed by CFD analysis of the <b>ball</b> <b>valve</b> before and after adjusting the backlash is made in ANSYS FLUENT and the results are compared.

This work presents the flow characteristics of fluid flowing through the conventional and modified <b>ball</b> <b>valves</b> for feasibility of a “linear” <b>ball</b> <b>valve.</b> Theoretical studies are discussed for determining explicit and implicit factors on the valve coefficient, which modulates the flow rate of fluid when the <b>ball</b> <b>valve</b> is operated in flow control processes. In experiment, the cross- sectional opening area at various opening degrees, the shape, {{and the location of}} the hole passage in <b>valve</b> <b>ball</b> are examined for complicated relations dependent to the flow rate of fluid. It can be concluded that those factors cause the modulation of flow rate when the ball is turned at different opening degree.
