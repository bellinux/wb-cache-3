5|$|After the First World War, the {{population}} of the west London suburbs continued to grow, thanks to improved rail transport links and the growth in ownership of automobiles. In 1925, the Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Transport</b> convened a conference between Surrey and Middlesex county councils with the aim of reaching a solution to the congestion problem, and the Great Chertsey Road scheme was revived. In 1927, the Royal Commission on Cross-River Traffic approved the scheme to relieve the by then chronic traffic congestion on the existing, mostly narrow, streets in the area, and on the narrow bridges at Richmond Bridge, Kew and Hammersmith. The Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Transport</b> agreed to pay heavy subsidies towards the cost.|$|E

The low number of walking commuters compared to the north metropolitan average of 1.5% and the Perth Statistical Region average of 1.81% is most likely due to {{the limited number of}} workplaces within walking distance.|$|E

5|$|One {{specific}} {{failure in}} the massive operation was the critical lack <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> aircraft for the operation, an unsolved flaw that had dogged every large-scale airborne operation the Allies had conducted. In the original planning for Varsity, an extra airborne division, the 13th, had been included; however, a lack <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> aircraft to drop this division led to it being excluded from the final plan. Thus, the unsolved problem of a shortage <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> aircraft meant {{that a third of}} the planned troops to be used were discarded, weakening the fighting power of the airborne formation. In the event, the airborne troops actually employed were sufficient to overwhelm the defenders.|$|E
