25|$|The high heel {{has been}} a central battleground of sexual {{politics}} ever since {{the emergence of the}} women's liberation movement of the 1970s. Many second-wave feminists rejected what they regarded as constricting standards of female beauty, created for the subordination and <b>objectifying</b> of women and self-perpetuated by reproductive competition and women's own aesthetics.|$|E
25|$|A forniphilic gag {{is a type}} of gag {{that has}} the primary purpose of <b>objectifying</b> and/or humiliating the wearer. The term forniphilic comes from the word forniphilia, which is the {{incorporation}} of a bound person into furniture or other objects. The gag becomes a mounting point for a tool or other device which allows a slave to perform a task or service for their master or mistress. When employing the gag, the slave's hands are usually bound behind them so they have no other option than to control the tool with the gag. In order to provide stability and to allow the slave to control the tool, a muzzle gag with a mouthpiece is commonly used as a base for attaching the tool.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} a study by Deborah Tolman and her colleagues {{indicated}} that adolescent exposure to sexuality on television in general does not directly affect their sexual behaviors, rather it {{is the type of}} message they view that has the most impact. Gender stereotypes enacted in sexual scenes on TV were seen to have a large affect on adolescents. Girls felt they had less control over their sexuality when they saw men <b>objectifying</b> women and not valuing commitment. The study discussed the risk of women internalizing this message and spreading the idea that it is okay to be weak and answer to men all the time. However, girls who saw women on TV who refuted men’s sexual advances usually felt more comfortable talking about their own sexual needs in their sexual experiences as well as standing up for themselves. They were comfortable setting sexual limits and therefore held more control over their sexuality. Findings for boys were less clear; those who saw dominant and aggressive men actually had less sexual experiences.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the extent to which women who self-objectify also <b>objectify</b> other women. One hundred thirty-two university students and their friends (64 women and 68 men) completed three questionnaires: (1) Noll and Fredrickson’s (1998) Self-Objectification Questionnaire, (2) a modified version of that questionnaire that measured individuals’ objectification of others, and (3) Slade, Dewey, Newton, and Brodie’s (1990) Body Cathexis scale. Women were {{more likely than men to}} self-objectify. Self-objectification was negatively related to body satisfaction for women but not for men. Both women and men <b>objectified</b> women more than they <b>objectified</b> men, although women’s objectification of other women was not significantly different than their objectification of men. Men <b>objectified</b> women more than women did, and women <b>objectified</b> men more than men did. Women were more likely to <b>objectify</b> other women than to <b>objectify</b> themselves. Higher self-objectification among both women and men was related to increased objectification of other women and men, but the relationships were stronger for women. Results indicate that women also <b>objectify</b> women, although not to the degree exhibited by men...|$|R

25|$|Othering is {{the process}} by which a person or a group is placed outside of the norm, into the margins. It is a system of {{discrimination}} whereby the characteristics of a group are used to distinguish them as separate from the norm. Othering plays a fundamental role in the history and continuance of racism and other forms of discrimination. For example, by <b>objectifying</b> culture as something different, exotic or underdeveloped is to generalise {{that it is not the}} same as 'normal' society. Europe's colonial attitude towards the Orient exemplifies through the attitude that the East was the opposite of the West; feminine where the West was masculine, weak where the West was strong and traditional where the West was progressive. By making these generalisations and othering the East, Europe was simultaneously defining herself as the norm, further entrenching the perceived gap. Much of the process of othering relies on imagined difference, or the expectation of difference. Spatial difference can be enough to conclude that 'we' are 'here' and the 'others' are over 'there', making 'here' normal and 'there' foreign. Imagined differences serve to categorise people into groups and assign them characteristics that suit the imaginer's expectations and desires.|$|E

500|$|According to Rhonda Wilcox and J. P. Williams in [...] "What Do You Think? The X-Files, Liminality, and Gender Pleasure", [...] "Humbug" [...] {{is about}} [...] "difference, sex, and looking". Regarding The X-Files as a whole, {{they say that}} the {{relationship}} between Mulder and Scully is non-sexual and [...] "quasi-marital". Although sharing a degree of intimacy that allows them to share each other's space, they avoid a sexual or <b>objectifying</b> gaze: [...] "They look into each other's eyes and argue ideas, rather than gazing at each other's bodies." [...] This status quo is challenged in this episode as the <b>objectifying</b> gaze is highlighted and deconstructed, although not between the partners themselves. According to Wilcox and Williams, a key scene involves Agent Scully and Lanny. When Lanny goes to wake Scully in her trailer one morning, he catches a glimpse of her breasts; she inadvertently exposes herself as she in turn catches sight of Lanny's uncovered parasitic twin; [...] "each gaze involves the objectification of difference". This objectification is emphasized by the fact that Scully's body is not normally revealed in this way.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} {{comparing the}} effects of breast reconstructive surgery, breast-conserving surgery, and mastectomy on body image and mental health yields conflicting results. <b>Objectified</b> body consciousness may be a factor that influences the psycho-logical well-being of breast cancer survivors. Women with average time of 19 months from breast cancer surgery were approached in outpatient clinics to participate in our study. Using structural equation modeling, we tested and verified a model that included self-reported <b>objectified</b> body consciousness, cancer-related body image discomfort, and depression among 193 breast cancer survivors in Taiwan. Our results provided support for the hypothesized indirect relation of <b>objectified</b> body consciousness with depression through the mediating role of cancer-related body image discomfort. Specifically, women with higher <b>objectified</b> body consciousness levels reported more cancer-related body image discomfort, which in turn was related to greater depression. Additionally, the degree of this mediation relationship across surgery types was different. These findings are significant to clinicians who should be cognizant of the potential role of <b>objectified</b> body consciousness in promoting cancer-related body image discomfort and depression in breast cancer survivors. Encouraging women to clarify their percep-tions of their new bodies and providing care combined with psychological counseling after breast cancer surgery are critical.

40|$|The {{current study}} sought to explain how gender {{socialization}} occurs within the mother-daughter relationship, and attempted to illuminate the devastating consequences of traditional feminine standards. The maternal role model was explored as a cultural transmitter, enforcer, and potential protector from {{the impact of these}} feminine standards on her daughter. To examine these relationships two models were tested: first, a mediation model examined the mediating role of mothers’ <b>objectified</b> body consciousness between mothers’ gender ideology and daughters’ gender ideology and <b>objectified</b> body consciousness; second, a moderation model investigating the moderating affect {{of the quality of the}} mother-daughter relationship between mothers’ gender ideology and daughters’ gender ideology and <b>objectified</b> body consciousness was also examined. Overall, these models appear to be poor fits for the data. Interestingly, there were significant direct effects for both mothers’ gender ideology on daughters’ perceptions of mother’s <b>objectified</b> body consciousness, as well as daughters’ gender ideology on daughters’ <b>objectified</b> body consciousness, as hypothesized. Whereas most of the significant correlations were in the expected directions, there were not as many significant correlations as originally hypothesized. ...|$|R

Andre Brock from Games and Culture opined that Alomar was a [...] "videogame equivalent of Pocahontas: {{a woman of}} color coerced into 'guiding' White explorers across a foreign land", and also said that her alternate costumes [...] "make {{it clear that she}} is window-dressing; a sexualized mule". Anita Sarkeesian said the tribal outfit was particularly disconcerting, as it combined sexualizing a female character [...] "with the racist tradition of exotifying women of color". Writing for the Digital Games Research Association, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that the first shot of Alomar in the game is a close up of her buttocks, immediately <b>objectifying</b> and characterising her. Eurogamers Whitehead said that Alomar [...] "neatly fits the approved Hollywood model of the light-skinned black heroine"; Geyser and Tshabalala similarly stated that her skin tone, outfit and job all conform to Western ideals. Writing for The Philosophy of Computer Games Conference, Harrer and Martine said that Alomar was given the role of a [...] "decorative side character", also stating that [...] "gendered and racialized hierarchies" [...] exist between Alomar and Redfield; Redfield's character is placed in charge of Alomar's resources, said to be reminiscent of [...] "an abusive heteronormative relationship".|$|E
500|$|Kesha's second studio album Warrior used {{considerably}} less autotune, although it still showed {{in a number}} of songs. The album's piano and guitar-driven ballads such as [...] "Love Into The Light", [...] "Wonderland" [...] and [...] "Past Lives" [...] display Kesha's vocal ability. Kesha also uses a trademark talky [...] "white-girl" [...] rapping style with exaggerated discordant phrasing and enunciation. Her vocal technique has led her to be credited as a rapper, a topic she disagreed with until fellow rappers André 3000, Wiz Khalifa, and Snoop Dogg endorsed her. On the subject, she said: [...] "The first time someone called me a rapper, I started laughing. I was shocked, and thought it was hilarious. It's crazy and funny to me." [...] The New York Times said Kesha [...] "threatens to become the most influential female rapper of the day, or at least the most popular. Pretending Kesha isn't a rapper is no longer feasible." [...] "Crazy Kids" [...] and [...] "C'Mon" [...] took greater shifts into [...] "party rap". Most of her lyrics chronicle her relationships and partying; the lighthearted subject matter of the latter and her unfiltered language saw many critics criticizing her for releasing frivolous and crass music. Jonah Weiner of Slate, however, stated that her jarring lyrics allowed her songs to become more memorable. In [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] and [...] "Boots & Boys", she objectifies men to poke fun at how male fronted rock bands and rappers can get away with <b>objectifying</b> women and not vice versa. The title track to her debut, [...] "Animal", is more aspirational and is intended to inspire people to embrace their individuality. Much more experimental than Animal, her second album, Warrior, contains dubstep elements and explores erotic experiences Kesha encountered with ghosts on the song [...] "Supernatural". Overall, Kesha said the theme of Warrior is magic.|$|E
