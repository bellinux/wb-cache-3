5|$|Inspired {{by their}} own daughters, Schooley and McCorkle {{conceived}} Kim as a teenage girl capable <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>anything,</b> basing the character on their own childhood hero James Bond. Upon noticing the lack of strong female leads in children's animated television, they decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the show's action hero accompanied by a male comedic sidekick {{in the form of}} best friend-turned-boyfriend Ron Stoppable. Devoid of both superpowers and a secret identity unlike traditional superheroes, the character's crime-fighting abilities are instead drawn from her cheerleading experience, thus making her more relatable to young viewers. Originally designed as a bombshell based on video game character Lara Croft, Kim's appearance was ultimately altered to resemble a teenage girl instead.|$|E

25|$|A report {{published}} in January 2011 by the Diário de Notícias, a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated {{that in the}} period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010, the democratic Portuguese Republic governments have encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This has funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable slippage in state-managed public works, inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of redundant public servants. The economy has also been damaged by risky credit, public debt creation and mismanaged European structural and cohesion funds for almost four decades. Apparently, the Prime Minister Sócrates's cabinet {{was not able to}} forecast or prevent any of this when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and later was incapable <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> to ameliorate the situation when the country {{was on the verge of}} bankruptcy in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Thus {{the final}} Confederate {{surrender}} {{of the war}} did not occur until November 6, 1865, when Waddell's ship reached Liverpool and was surrendered to Capt. R. N.

[...] Ultimately, after {{an investigation by the}} British Admiralty court, Waddell and his crew were exonerated <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> that violated the laws of war and were unconditionally released. Shenandoah herself was sold to Sultan Majid bin Said of Zanzibar in 1866 and renamed El Majidi.

500|$|So far, {{changes to}} the {{original}} had been of a minor nature, but when the opera reappeared in June 1869 it had been entirely restructured. Although the musical numbers were still linked by dialogue, the first act had been divided in two, to create a three-act opera. Various numbers, including the drinking song and the new polka, were repositioned, and the polka was now followed by a furiant. A [...] "March of the Comedians" [...] was added, to introduce the strolling players in what was now Act III. A short duet for Esmeralda and the Principal Comedian was dropped. In September 1870 The Bartered Bride reached its final form, when all the dialogue was replaced by recitative. Smetana's own opinion of the finished work, given much later, was largely dismissive: he described it as [...] "a toy ... composing it was mere child's play". It was written, he said [...] "to spite those who accused me of being Wagnerian and incapable <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> in a lighter vein." ...|$|E
