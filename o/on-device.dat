2500|$|On July 2, 2014, HTC Germany {{announced}} a Dual SIM variant via a press release. The phone was made available in Germany, Austria and Switzerland in calendar week 28 {{of that year}} for a price of €679 (799CHF) which {{at that time was}} slightly higher than the MSRP of €649 for the single SIM version but some €100 higher than typical retail prices which had already begun to drop for the regular model. Other selected markets followed. In Germany the release was limited with only METRO-owned electronics store chains Media Markt and Saturn carrying the phone in small quantities. The only color option is [...] "Gunmetal Grey". The hardware is mostly identical to the regular model without the option to double the 16GB of <b>on-device</b> storage {{as is the case with}} the single SIM variant. Also, the radio supports less LTE-bands, most notably omitting band 20 which reduces LTE-usability in countries like Germany where providers prefer the 800MHz frequency outside of downtown areas. Both SIM-slots are of nano-size and the device retains the additional microSD-slot.|$|E
50|$|<b>On-Device</b> Portals (ODPs) allow {{mobile phone}} users to easily browse, {{purchase}} and use mobile content and services. An ODP platform enables operators {{to provide a}} consistent and branded <b>on-device</b> experience across their broadening portfolio of services and typically provides <b>on-device</b> catalogs of content for purchase, deep links to WAP portals, customer care functionality and rich media services such as full track music, TV and video.|$|E
50|$|<b>On-Device</b> Portals can be {{targeted}} {{to a specific}} mobile operating system or provide multi-platform support allowing operators to achieve a consistent, branded experience across of all devices whether they run on Symbian (Symbian OS), Microsoft (Windows Mobile), BREW (Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless), Java or Research in Motion (RIM) platforms. Some vendors have server-side components to their <b>On-Device</b> Portal offerings which are tied into operator billing systems that deliver features such as usage tracking and lifecycle management. <b>On-Device</b> Portals are not intended to replace the operating system (OS) or {{other aspects of the}} phone’s interface.|$|E

50|$|The <b>On-device</b> portal is {{also not}} without complications, {{supporting}} wide handset lists is {{a lot harder to}} manage than mobile web content, and updating major components is not just a case of re-publishing, but of redistributing applications. At the same time, while it is generally easy to test web content on a handful of browsers, portals need to be tested on nearly every handset which will be expected to use the <b>on-device</b> portal.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>On-Device</b> Portal {{was coined}} by the London-based ARCchart Research in 2001. In 2005, ARCchart {{estimated}} 10 million ODP-enabled units {{were in the}} marketplace.|$|E

The app store is often shared with smartphones {{that use the}} same operating system.|$|E
50|$|<b>On-Device</b> Portal {{technology}} {{emerged in}} 2000, as operating systems and Java {{were beginning to}} be deployed on mobile handsets. One.Tel launched smart on device applications {{using a combination of}} Java and SIMtoolkit technology in May 2000. In 2002, four vendors — ActiveSky, SurfKitchen, Action Engine and Trigenix - began developing ODP offerings. In March 2003 at CeBIT O2 demonstrated an ActiveSky powered O2 branded <b>On-Device</b> portal that was both user and operator (remotely) reconfigurable, that same year KDDI deployed an ActiveSky based solution. In 2003, operators including O2, Sonofon and ONE began to deploy ODP solutions. From 2001 to 2005, it was central to many MVNO solutions, as a more cost effective and customer-centric alternative to handset software variants or SIM toolkits, Virtuser developed many trials of these, including a pre-blackberry email service that used Bluetooth in buildings.|$|E
50|$|ARCchart {{expects that}} number of <b>On-Device</b> Portals {{licenses}} {{to grow to}} 1.1 billion by 2009.As the ODP market matures {{it is expected to}} move beyond mass market services such as mobile TV, music and content catalogs to provide an experience where the subscriber can choose from a broad range of services and content, personalized to their needs.|$|E

Playphone is based in Silicon Valley, California with offices in San Jose, California; Brooklin, Sao Paulo; Beijing, China; and United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|A {{key benefit}} of <b>on-device</b> portals {{is the ability}} to target the user rather than the device itself. This {{personalized}} service delivery, coupled with the ability to be updated on a frequent basis by the operator - refining services or adding new content - makes ODPs an attractive proposition that has already proven successful in encouraging users to access mobile content. By enhancing the user experience, ODPs improve customer satisfaction, reduce churn and in turn, drive higher data revenues.|$|E
50|$|Most {{security}} {{products have}} historically been point solutions deployed as hardware appliances, Zscaler is very different being a cloud-based Security for a Service platform, that requires no on-premises and <b>on-device</b> hardware or software. Zscaler is a broad platform integrating for many different security applications - from web-security to next generation firewall, SSL decryption and inspection, data leakage protection, intrusion detection, and advanced threat protection, thus {{it can also be}} considered a cloud-based, carrier-grade, globally deployed Unified Threat Management system.|$|E
50|$|The {{online store}} {{contains}} albums and tracks (MP3 with 30 second preview), tones (delivered to device 'over the air' or {{straight to the}} mobile phone from web). The site features re-download (within 5 days) features and dual-download for purchase <b>on-device</b> (see below). The main driver for the re-launch and MP3 was to broaden the attractiveness and accessibility due to the difficulties of DRM/Windows Media issues on the old store, which were featured in many negative reviews.|$|E

Hughes {{went on to}} produce the first EEPROM devices.In 1978, George Perlegos at Intel developed the Intel 2816, which was built on earlier EPROM technology, but used a thin gate oxide layer enabling the chip to erase its own bits without a UV source. Perlegos and others later left Intel to form Seeq Technology, which used <b>on-device</b> charge pumps to supply the high voltages necessary for programming EEPROMs.|$|E
