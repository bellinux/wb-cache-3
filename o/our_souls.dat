5|$|The third book {{continues}} along {{a similar}} vein, condemning cosmetics {{on the grounds}} that it is <b>our</b> <b>souls,</b> not our bodies, that we should seek to beautify. Clement also opposes the dyeing of men's hair and male depilation as effeminacy. He advises choosing one's company carefully, to avoid being corrupted by immoral people, and while arguing that material wealth is no sin in itself, it is too likely to distract one from the infinitely more important spiritual wealth which is found in Christ. The work finishes with selections of scripture supporting Clement's argument, and following a prayer, the lyrics of a hymn.|$|E

25|$|And so, {{in modern}} times, when liberties {{are to be}} taken, and the {{intrusive}} passions of men to be indulged, precedent and permission, or what sounds like them, may be easily found and quoted for everything. But Samuel, in God's Name, silenced all this, giving them to understand, that in His sight the whole {{was a question of}} motive and purpose, not of ostensible and colourable argument;—in His sight, I say, to Whom we, as well as they, are nationally responsible for much more than the soundness of our deductions as matter of disputation, or of law; we are responsible for the meaning and temper in which we deal with His Holy Church, established among us for the salvation of <b>our</b> <b>souls.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Alexandrian {{contribution}} to Christian mysticism centers on Origen and Clement of Alexandria. Clement {{was an early}} Christian humanist who argued that reason {{is the most important}} aspect of human existence and that gnosis (not something we can attain by ourselves, but the gift of Christ) helps us find the spiritual realities that are hidden behind the natural world and within the scriptures. Given the importance of reason, Clement stresses apatheia as a reasonable ordering of our passions in order to live within God's love, which is seen as a form of truth. Origen, who had a lasting influence on Eastern Christian thought, further develops the idea that the spiritual realities can be found through allegorical readings of the scriptures (along the lines of Jewish aggadah tradition), but he focuses his attention on the Cross and on the importance of imitating Christ through the Cross, especially through spiritual combat and asceticism. Origen stresses the importance of combining intellect and virtue (theoria and praxis) in our spiritual exercises, drawing on the image of Moses and Aaron leading the Israelites through the wilderness, and he describes our union with God as the marriage of <b>our</b> <b>souls</b> with Christ the Logos, using the wedding imagery from the Song of Songs. Alexandrian mysticism developed alongside Hermeticism and Neoplatonism and therefore share some of the same ideas, images, etc. in spite of their differences.|$|E

In a review in the Coventry Herald Eliot wrote that in reading The Nemesis of Faith [...] "we {{seem to be in}} companionship with a spirit who is transfusing himself into <b>our</b> <b>souls,</b> and so vitalising them by his superior energy, that life, both outward and inward, presents itself to us in higher relief, in colours brightened and deepened." ...|$|E
500|$|By July 1665, plague was {{rampant in}} the City of London. [...] King Charles II of England, {{his family and}} his court left the city for Salisbury, moving on to Oxford [...] in September when some cases of plague {{occurred}} in Salisbury. The aldermen and most of the other city authorities opted to stay at their posts. The Lord Mayor of London, Sir John Lawrence, also decided to stay in the city. Businesses were closed when merchants and professionals fled. Defoe wrote [...] "Nothing was to be seen but wagons and carts, with goods, women, servants, children, coaches filled with people of the better sort, and horsemen attending them, and all hurrying away". As the plague raged throughout the summer, {{only a small number of}} clergymen, physicians and apothecaries remained to cope with an increasingly large number of victims. Edward Cotes, author of London's Dreadful Visitation, expressed the hope that [...] "Neither the Physicians of <b>our</b> <b>Souls</b> or Bodies may hereafter in such great numbers forsake us".|$|E

500|$|With the Lords of the Welsh Marches now in rebellion, Montfort {{solicited}} {{the aid of}} Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the Prince of Wales. Llywelyn {{agreed to}} help, in return for full recognition of his title and the promise that he could keep all military gains. Whatever benefits this alliance might have brought Montfort, the large concessions cost him popularity at home. Meanwhile, Edward laid siege {{to the town of}} Gloucester, which fell on 29 June. Montfort's goal now became to unite with the forces of his son Simon, and engage with the royal army, but the younger Simon moved much too slowly westwards from London. Eventually Simon made it to the baronial stronghold of Kenilworth, but [...] Edward managed to inflict great losses on Simon's forces, many of whom were quartered outside the castle walls. From there the Prince moved south, where on 4 August, using many banners captured at Kenilworth to deceive Montfort into thinking his reinforcements were arriving, he managed to trap the older Montfort in a loop of the Avon, blocking off the only bridge and thereby forcing Montfort to fight without his son's reinforcements. When Montfort realized this, he allegedly commented: [...] "May the Lord have mercy upon <b>our</b> <b>souls,</b> as our bodies are theirs." ...|$|E

The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, [...] "" [...] (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that {{was present at the}} Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn [...] "", which is based on the Latin hymn [...] "Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium". Movement 6 is a chorale, verse four of Philipp Nicolai's hymn [...] "". Nicolai's [...] "Geistlich Brautlied" [...] (Spiritual bridal song) continues the theme of unity between Soul and Spirit.|$|E
