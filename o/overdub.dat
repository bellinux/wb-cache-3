5|$|Erinys– The {{daughter}} of Thanatos. After {{the destruction of}} Atlantis, Erinys searched for Kratos, killing various Spartans as a warning for Kratos to stop his quest to find Deimos. Erinys eventually found Kratos in the Mounts of Aroania, and after a land battle, an aerial battle ensued as Erinys shape shifted into an enormous bird before being killed by Kratos, after which, Kratos took her power, the Scourge of Erinys. The character was <b>overdub</b> voiced by Jennifer Hale and Erin Torpey in Ghost of Sparta.|$|E
25|$|On 30 April 1969, Harrison overdubbed a new guitar solo on {{the best}} take from 31 January. He overdubbed another solo on 4 January 1970. The first <b>overdub</b> solo {{was used for the}} {{original}} single release, and the second <b>overdub</b> solo was used for the original album release. Some fans mistakenly believe that there were two versions of the basic track – based mostly on the different guitar solos, but also on other differences in overdubs and mixes.|$|E

500|$|On March 17, 1970, at Columbia Recording Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, {{instrumental}} <b>overdubs</b> {{were recorded}} for [...] "Wigwam" [...] {{and several other}} songs. Dylan was not present for the <b>overdubs,</b> and they were overseen by Johnston.|$|R
50|$|The lead vocal was {{recorded}} {{at the same}} time as the rhythm track, a change from the Beatles' post-1964 approach of <b>overdubbing</b> the vocal. <b>Overdubs</b> were added to this recording on 21 February 1967 at EMI Studios.|$|R
5000|$|Electrical {{recording}} {{made it more}} {{feasible to}} record one part to disc and then play that back while playing another part, recording both parts to a second disc. This and conceptually related techniques, known as <b>overdubbing,</b> enabled studios to create recorded [...] "performances" [...] that feature one or more artists each singing multiple parts or playing multiple instrument parts and that therefore could not be duplicated by the same artist or artists performing live. The first commercially issued records using <b>overdubbing</b> were released by the Victor Talking Machine Company in the late 1920s. However <b>overdubbing</b> was of limited use until the advent of audio tape. Use of tape <b>overdubbing</b> was pioneered by Les Paul in the 1940s.|$|R
25|$|Ray Manzarek {{played the}} song's bass line {{with his left}} hand on a Fender Rhodes Piano Bass, while {{performing}} the other keyboard parts on a Vox Continental using his right hand. After the recording session, producer Paul A. Rothchild brought in session musician Larry Knechtel to <b>overdub</b> a Fender Precision Bass guitar to double the keyboard bass line. When the Doors played the song at live concerts, Manzarek used the Fender Rhodes Piano Bass without augmentation.|$|E
25|$|Harry Edward Nilsson III (June 15, 1941 – January 15, 1994), usually {{credited}} as Nilsson, was an American singer-songwriter who {{achieved the}} peak of his commercial success in the early 1970s. His work is characterized by pioneering <b>overdub</b> experiments, returns to the Great American Songbook, and fusions of Caribbean sounds. A tenor with a three-and-a-half octave range, Nilsson {{was one of the few}} major pop-rock recording artists of his era to achieve significant commercial success without ever performing major public concerts or undertaking regular tours.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} ways to create techno, but the {{majority}} will depend upon the use of loop-based step sequencing as a compositional method. Techno musicians, or producers, rather than employing traditional compositional techniques, may work in an improvisatory fashion, often treating the electronic music studio as one large instrument. The collection of devices found in a typical studio will include units that are capable of producing many different sounds and effects. Studio production equipment is generally synchronized using a hardware- or computer-based MIDI sequencer, enabling the producer to combine in one arrangement the sequenced output of many devices. A typical approach to using this type of technology compositionally is to <b>overdub</b> successive layers of material while continuously looping a single measure or sequence of measures. This process will usually continue until a suitable multi-track arrangement has been produced.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, 1969, Nilsson and Newman {{began to}} record the album. After basic tracks were laid down, Nilsson spent six weeks <b>overdubbing</b> his voice to create layers and harmonies, line by line. As many as 118 <b>overdubs</b> were laid down for a single song.|$|R
5000|$|The {{invention}} of magnetic tape opened up new possibilities for <b>overdubbing,</b> {{particularly with the}} development of multitrack recording with sel-sync.
