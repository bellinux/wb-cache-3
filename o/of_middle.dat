Rocks brought down the Tamar from Dartmoor include ores containing tin, copper, tungsten, lead and other minerals. There is evidence that the middle Devonian limestone belt at the south edge of Plymouth and in Plymstock was quarried at West Hoe, Cattedown and Radford.|$|E

5|$|According to Hossein Nasr, the {{earliest}} European literature often refers to Muhammad unfavorably.

They interpreted the biography through a Christian religious filter; one that viewed Muhammad {{as a person}} who seduced the Saracens into his submission under religious guise. Popular European literature of the time portrayed Muhammad as though he were worshipped by Muslims, similar to an idol or a heathen god.|$|E

5|$|Buell quickly {{assigned}} Garfield {{the task}} of driving Confederate forces out of eastern Kentucky, giving him the 18th Brigade for the campaign, which, besides his own 42nd, included the 40th Ohio Infantry, two Kentucky infantry regiments and two cavalry units. They departed Catlettsburg, Kentucky, in mid-December, advancing through {{the valley of the}} Big Sandy River. The march was uneventful until Union forces reached Paintsville, Kentucky, on January 6, 1862, where Garfield's cavalry engaged the rebels at Jenny's Creek. Confederate troops under Brigadier General Humphrey Marshall held the town in numbers roughly equal to Garfield's own, but Garfield positioned his troops so as to deceive Marshall into believing that rebel forces were outnumbered. Marshall ordered his troops to withdraw to the forks <b>of</b> <b>Middle</b> Creek, on the road to Virginia; Garfield ordered his troops to pursue the Confederates. They attacked the rebel positions on January 9, 1862, in the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Middle</b> Creek, the only pitched battle Garfield personally commanded. At the end of the fighting, the Confederates withdrew from the field, and Garfield sent his troops to Prestonsburg to reprovision.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the size <b>of</b> the <b>middle</b> class in developing Asia across countries and over time. Based on an absolute measure <b>of</b> the <b>middle</b> class <b>of</b> $ 2 -$ 20 (2005 purchasing power parity United States dollars), it finds that between 1990 and 2008, the size <b>of</b> the <b>middle</b> class in developing Asia has grown dramatically in percentage share, absolute size, and purchasing power. However, {{there are large}} variations in the size and growth <b>of</b> the <b>middle</b> class across countries, with the primary growth <b>of</b> the <b>middle</b> class largely driven by the People's Republic of China (PRC). Considerably smaller growth has occurred in many countries including Nepal and Sri Lanka. Still, a large portion <b>of</b> the <b>middle</b> class residing in the $ 2 -$ 4 range are extremely vulnerable, {{and many of the}} poor in Asia remain in the PRC and India. This suggests that it may be good for policymakers to not only focus on countries that have lagged behind in terms of growth <b>of</b> the <b>middle</b> class, but that it should also concern itself with focusing on countries where there is still considerable room to build, and bolster the absolute size <b>of</b> the <b>middle</b> class in Asia...|$|R
