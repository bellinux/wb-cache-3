The energy is generated by the Egger factory from waste heat and biomass in conjunction with an absorption heat pump and is transferred at the boundary of the factory site into the district heating network. At the end of 2009 around 400 buildings and 1,300 households in St. Johann were heated by district heating. These include the district hospital, the barracks, the schools, traders, single and multi-family homes. A total of about 28 km of routing, or 56 km (double) of piping has been laid. In 2009, [...] of heating was purchased, that corresponds to an oil consumption of about [...] per year. In the medium term the introduction of district heating in St. Johann will save about 12,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually in the village centre. To read the heat meters and to visualize the individual house systems, an optical fibre was laid as part of the installation of the heating district network.|$|E

More residents start to install their <b>own</b> <b>energy</b> <b>generation</b> sources such as photovoltaic cells. The introduction of distributed generation in the low-voltage network can have effects that were unexpected when the network was designed and {{could lead to a}} bad power quality. These developments ask for better insight in the effects of a planning for a fleet of households in a network. This paper presents the results of adding network models to planning strategies. Forward-backward load-flow calculations for a three phase low-voltage network are implemented to simulate the network. The results from load-flow calculations are used as feedback for demand side management. The results in this paper show that the implementation is both fast and accurate enough for integration purposes. Combining load-flow feedback and demand side management leads to improved worst-case voltage levels and cable usage whilst peakshaving optimization performance does not degrade significantly. These results indicate that load-flow calculations should be integrated with demand side management methodologies to evaluate whether networks support the effects of steering production and consumption. More sophisticated integration of network models are left for future work...|$|E

Minimizing the cost is not only of interest to the consumers but is also socially desirable because it reduces the consumption at times of peak demand (since differential pricing mechanisms like time-of-use pricing is usually used by electricity companies to discourage consumption at times of peak demand). We develop an iterative coordination algorithm in which the coordinator makes the storage decision and shapes the demands of the consumers by designing a virtual price signal for the agents.

40|$|System {{changing}} innovations for sustainability transitions {{are proposed}} {{to emerge in}} radical innovative niches. ‘Strategic Niche Management’ theory predicts that niche level actors and networks will aggregate learning from local projects, distilling and disseminating best practice. This should lower the bar for new projects to form and establish, thereby encouraging the innovation to diffuse through replication. Within this literature, grassroots innovations emerging from civil society are an under researched site of sociotechnical innovation for sustainable energy transitions. We consider the emerging community energy sector in the UK, in order to empirically test this model. Community energy is a diverse grassroots led sector including both demand and supply side initiatives for sustainable energy such as community <b>owned</b> renewable <b>energy</b> <b>generation,</b> village hall refurbishments, behaviour change initiatives and energy efficiency projects. Our analysis draws on in depth qualitative case study research with twelve local projects, and a study of how intermediary organisations aim to support local projects and encourage replication. This rich data allows us to examine the extent and nature of interactions between projects and intermediary actors in order to evaluate the utility of niche theories in the civil society context. In particular, we investigate which types of knowledge, support and resources were needed by our case study projects to become established and thrive, and compare and contrast this with those offered by the emerging community energy niche. Our findings indicate that while networking and intermediary organisations can effectively collate and spread some types of learning and information necessary for replication, this is not sufficient: tacit knowledge, trust and confidence are essential to these projects’ success, but {{are more difficult to}} abstract and translate to new settings. We draw out the implications of our findings for niche theory, for community energy and other grassroots practitioners aiming to build robust influential niches, and for policymakers eager to harness civil society’s innovative potential for sustainability...|$|R
