5|$|As much as 80% <b>of</b> <b>therapeutic</b> {{doses of}} {{salicylic}} acid is metabolized in the liver. Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact {{is referred to}} as the acyl glucuronide; the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important.|$|E

5|$|Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolo{{benzodiazepine}}: a benzodiazepine with a triazole ring {{attached to}} its structure. As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces a variety <b>of</b> <b>therapeutic</b> and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor {{site on the}} GABAA receptor and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. The GABAA receptor {{is made up of}} 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines like triazolam that have a triazol ring attached to their structure appear to have antidepressant properties, since the structure resembles that of tricyclic antidepressants, which also have rings. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} ability to quickly grow and the {{relative}} ease with which they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms. This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. This is achievable in some well-studied bacteria, with models of Escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and tested. This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to bioengineer bacteria for the production <b>of</b> <b>therapeutic</b> proteins, such as insulin, growth factors, or antibodies.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of emotionality during the psychotherapeutic hour {{has been extensively}} documented in the psychotherapy theory and research literature. Prominent theorists and researchers have advocated {{that the degree of}} client's emotionality is an important therapeutic variable that facilitates therapeutic and personality change. The {{purpose of this study was}} to (a) examine the relationship between client level and type of emotionality as measured by the Experiencing, Strength of Feeling-Revised, and Vocal Quality Scales and the occurrence <b>of</b> in-session <b>therapeutic</b> phenomena as measured by the Category System of Client Good Moments scale, and (b) what levels and types of emotionality occur with specific categories <b>of</b> in-session <b>therapeutic</b> phenomena. Trained judges from Master's and Ph.

The findings indicated that: (a) as the level of experiencing and strength of feeling increased, so did the occurrence <b>of</b> in-session <b>therapeutic</b> phenomena; (b) when the client's vocal quality was Focused or Emotional, the occurrence <b>of</b> in-session <b>therapeutic</b> phenomena significantly increased; and (c) there are optimal levels and types of emotionality associated with particular categories <b>of</b> in-session <b>therapeutic</b> phenomena. These findings have implications for refining and extending counselling theory, for process research, and for clinical practice and training. Future directions are also outlined...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Following two {{randomized}} controlled trials that demonstrated reduced mortality and better neurological outcome in cardiac arrest patients, mild therapeutic hypothermia was implemented in many intensive care units. Up to now, no large observational studies have confirmed the beneficial effects <b>of</b> mild <b>therapeutic</b> hypothermia. DESIGN: Internet-based survey {{combined with a}} retrospective, observational study. PATIENTS: All patients admitted to an intensive care unit in The Netherlands after cardiac arrest from January 1, 1999 until January 1, 2009. DATA SOURCE: Dutch National Intensive Care Evaluation database. METHODS: The moment of implementation <b>of</b> mild <b>therapeutic</b> hypothermia for each hospital participating in the Dutch National Intensive Care Evaluation database was determined with an Internet survey. To compare mortality before and after implementation <b>of</b> mild <b>therapeutic</b> hypothermia, the odds ratio adjusted for Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score, age, gender, propensity score, and in- or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was calculated. Patients were excluded if 1) they were admitted to an intensive care unit that {{did not respond to}} the survey, 2) they were admitted within 3 months after implementation <b>of</b> mild <b>therapeutic</b> hypothermia, 3) they had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of > 8, or 4) they did not satisfy the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II inclusion criteria. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 13, 962 patients were admitted to an intensive care unit following cardiac arrest. In total 8, 645 patients were excluded, 5, 544 because of a Glasgow Coma Scale score of > 8. Of the resultant 5, 317 patients, 1, 547 patients were treated before and 3, 770 patients after implementation <b>of</b> mild <b>therapeutic</b> hypothermia. Patients admitted after implementation <b>of</b> mild <b>therapeutic</b> hypothermia had lower minimal and maximal temperatures (p <. 0001) during the first 24 hrs on the intensive care unit compared to patients admitted before implementation <b>of</b> mild <b>therapeutic</b> hypothermia. The adjusted odds ratio of the hospital mortality of patients treated after implementation <b>of</b> mild <b>therapeutic</b> hypothermia was 0. 80 (95 % confidence interval of 0. 65 - 0. 98, p =. 029). CONCLUSION: The results of this retrospective, observational survey suggest that implementation <b>of</b> mild <b>therapeutic</b> hypothermia in Dutch intensive care units is associated with a 20 % relative reduction of hospital mortality in cardiac arrest patients...|$|R

40|$|Title: The {{influence}} of professionals’ perceived ‘difficulty’ with {{patients with a}} depressive disorder and these patients’ needs on the quality <b>of</b> the <b>therapeutic</b> relationship. Background: The strength <b>of</b> the <b>therapeutic</b> relationship correlates with patient outcomes, for example: improved quality of life, reduced symptom severity, improved global functioning, satisfaction with treatment, higher community living skills, and better medication adherence. Previous studies have demonstrated the {{influence of}} patients’ needs and professionals’ perceived ‘difficulty’ with patients on the quality <b>of</b> the <b>therapeutic</b> relationship. There is uncertainty about the therapeutic relationship between patients with a depressive disorder, specifically in depressive patients with severe mental illness, and mental health care professionals. Aim: In order to improve patient outcomes, the influence of professionals’ perceived difficulty with patients and patients’ needs on the therapeutic relationship was explored. Research question: “What is the influence of professionals’ perceived ‘difficulty’ with patients with a depressive disorder and these patients’ needs on the quality <b>of</b> the <b>therapeutic</b> relationship?” Method: An exploratory, cross-sectional design was {{used to describe the}} relationship among professionals’ perceived difficulty with patients and patients’ needs on the quality <b>of</b> the <b>therapeutic</b> relationship at baseline. Results: In regards to the quality <b>of</b> the <b>therapeutic</b> relationship, patients appreciated positive collaboration with respect to emotional difficulties and positive clinician input. In 92 % of the patients there were ‘no’ or ‘met’ health and social needs. In 8 %, patients reported ‘unmet’ needs. Professionals rated 40 % of the patients as ‘difficult’. Conclusion: This study showed a significant contribution of professionals’ perceived ‘difficulty’ with patients on the quality <b>of</b> the <b>therapeutic</b> relationship, in contrast to patients’ needs. Recommendations: To improve patient outcomes, it is recommended that professionals focus on: providing more information about treatment, psychological distress, company, being stern, and mutually agreement upon goals...|$|R
