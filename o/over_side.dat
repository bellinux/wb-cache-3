500|$|On {{the album}}'s initial release, the album {{received}} very positive reviews from rock critics. Writing for Creem, Joe Fernbacher called the Before and After Science [...] "the perfect Eno album", while Mitchell Schneider wrote a positive review in Crawdaddy!, stating that he couldn't [...] "remember {{the last time}} a record took such a hold of —and gave [...] such an extreme case of vertigo, too". In Down Beat, Russel Shaw wrote that [...] " [...] is another typically awesome, stunning and numbing Brian Eno album—the record Pink Floyd could make if they set their collective mind to it." [...] Tom Carson of Rolling Stone noted that the album [...] "is less immediately ingratiating than either Taking Tiger Mountain or Here Come the Warm Jets. Still, the execution here is close to flawless, and despite Eno's eclecticism, the disparate styles he employs connect brilliantly." [...] Critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A− rating, stating that he [...] "didn't like the murkiness of the quiet, largely instrumental reflections that take <b>over</b> <b>side</b> two", but didn't find that it [...] "diminishes side one's oblique, charming tour of the popular rhythms of the day". In 1979, Before and After Science was voted 12th best album of the year on the Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1978.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the earlier}} shrine had been {{oriented}} from {{west to east}} in the medieval tradition, the new church was oriented south to north, across the older building. The plan of church is simple and spacious – a wide single nave, a shallow squared apse, virtually no transept, and raised pulpits between recessed galleries <b>over</b> <b>side</b> chapels. This style, the “auditorium-church” ideal for preaching, became popularly known as the “Jesuit style” and was widely copied by the order throughout Portugal and in the Portuguese colonial towns in Brazil and the Far East. The simple and sober exterior of the church, characteristic of the Portuguese “plain style” (estilo chão) contrasts with the highly decorated Baroque interior with its glazed tiles, gilt woodwork, multi-colored statues [...] and oil paintings.|$|E

5000|$|On the {{original}} {{release of the}} album, as well as {{the original}} CD release, side one of the album ends in the middle of [...] "The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles". The sound at the end of side one was a nod to children storytelling records which signaled the child or parent to flip the record <b>over.</b> <b>Side</b> two begins where it left off. However, on the 2003 remastered CD, the second part begins with the full story so that it does not get cut off in the middle.|$|E
5000|$|To throw a gyroball, {{a pitcher}} holds {{the side of}} the ball with a fastball grip. The pitcher's hips and {{throwing}} shoulder must be in near-perfect sync, something the book refers to as [...] "double-spin mechanics." [...] As the pitcher rotates his shoulder, he snaps his wrist and pulls down his fingers rather than flipping them over the ball, as happens with curveballs. The rotation is side <b>over</b> <b>side.</b> When the pitcher lets go, he must pronate his wrist, or turn it so the palm faces third base. It's like a right-hander throwing a screwball, only instead of the ball last touching the middle finger, it spins off the index finger.|$|E
5000|$|Chi-Sound Records is an {{independent}} record label set up in 1976 by established Chicago record producer Carl Davis.

He produced Gene Chandler's number One hit, [...] "Duke Of Earl" [...] for Vee-Jay. Later, as A&R chief for Okeh, he produced a run of hits with writer/singer Curtis Mayfield, for another Chicago artist, Major Lance, including [...] "The Monkey Time" [...] and [...] "Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um".

It was almost identical to Side Glances, continuing to offer essentially {{the same sort of}} middle-class family humor. He soon added a Sunday strip, Our Neighbors, the Ripples, a title eventually shortened to The Ripples. The Sunday strip was dropped in 1948, but his daily panel continued until 1971. Stephen Becker (Comic Art in America) commented, [...] "He has never attempted to induce the belly laugh; he feels that a gently humorous reminder of something that has probably happened to his reader will suffice." ...|$|E
5000|$|Squier had {{a unique}} {{broadcasting}} style; he often described NASCAR drivers in his era as [...] "common men doing uncommon things" [...] and describing wrecks as [...] "side <b>over</b> <b>side,</b> end over end" [...] for flips and for calling wrecked racecars {{with the phrase}} [...] "all torn up". A battle for position involving a large pack of cars would periodically {{be referred to as}} [...] "an Oklahoma land rush."He was also known for the ability to switch between the [...] "radio" [...] style of broadcasting and [...] "TV" [...] styles. One of the biggest examples was the 1981 Talladega 500, when video went out and only the audio remained and he called the final laps when Ron Bouchard won.|$|E

50|$|In 1983 Astra withdrew its neuropharmacological drug Zelmid, {{which had}} only {{introduced}} the year before, {{because of concerns}} <b>over</b> <b>side</b> effects. Zelmid was a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and although Astra was {{a pioneer in the}} SSRI area, they did not follow up with another drug using the same mechanism. Instead, it was the US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company which later introduced the bestselling SSRI drug Prozac, which lead Astra to realise that they would probably had been able to beat Lilly to this lucrative market if they had continued their SSRI drug development. Despite losing out in the SSRI area, in the 1990s, Astra had become one of the heaviest companies on the Stockholm stock exchange, to a large extent due to profits from Losec.|$|E
50|$|The mosque has an {{octagonal}} {{base with}} a central dome. Its plan is a variant of that of the Rüstem Pasha Mosque, but variations such as its corner domes give it a more classical character than the Rüstem Pasha Mosque. It {{is also one of}} the earliest examples of the 18th-century trend towards domes that were proportionally higher and narrower. The cross vault over the central opening is an innovation first seen in this mosque. Rather than the five domes over the entrance portico - typical for Ottoman mosques - the Yeni Valide employs a cross vault over a central bay and cloister vaults <b>over</b> <b>side</b> bays. The interior decoration consists of stone carvings including muqarnas - intricate stone carvings with floral motifs - and tiles with repetitive floral patterns.|$|E
50|$|As {{time went}} on the Alpine passes were {{improved}} to make travel easier.

Most of the carriage roads across the great alpine passes were thus constructed in the first half of the 19th century, largely due to the Napoleon's need for such roads as modes of military transport. As late as 1905, the highest pass over the main chain that had a carriage road was the Great St Bernard (8111 ft), but three still higher passes <b>over</b> <b>side</b> ridges have roads—the col de l'Iseran, the Stelvio Pass (9040 ft), the Col du Galibier (8721 ft), in the Dauphiné Alps, and the Umbrail Pass (8242 ft).|$|E
