40|$|Soil {{samples from}} a Louisiana Barataria Basin {{brackish}} marshes were fractionated into acid-volatile sulfides (AVS), HCl-soluble sulfur, elemental sulfur, pyrite sulfur, ester-sulfate sulfur, and carbon-bonded sulfur. Inorganic sulfur composed 13 % <b>of</b> total <b>sulfur</b> in brackish marsh soil with HCl-soluble sulfur representing 63 – 92 % <b>of</b> the inorganic <b>sulfur</b> fraction. AVS represented less than 1 % <b>of</b> the total <b>sulfur</b> pool. Pyrite sulfur and elemental sulfur together accounted for 8 – 33 % <b>of</b> the inorganic <b>sulfur</b> pool. Organic sulfur, in the forms <b>of</b> ester-sulfate <b>sulfur</b> and carbon-bonded sulfur, {{was the most}} dominant pool representing the majority <b>of</b> total <b>sulfur</b> in brackish marsh. Results were compared to values reported for fresh and salt marshes.

Along a salinity gradient, HCl-soluble sulfur represented 78 – 86 % <b>of</b> the inorganic <b>sulfur</b> fraction in fresh, brackish, and salt marsh. Organic sulfur in the forms <b>of</b> ester-sulfate <b>sulfur</b> and carbon-bonded sulfur was the major constituent (76 – 87 %) <b>of</b> total <b>sulfur</b> in all marshes.

40|$|The {{decrease}} in the reflectivity of Venus in the near-UV can be explained if the clouds contain particles <b>of</b> elemental <b>sulfur</b> in addition to sulfuric acid.

5|$|Although {{overall the}} shape of Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} resembles that of the Earth's, closer to the planet its structure is very different. Jupiter's volcanically active moon Io is a strong source of plasma in its own right, and loads Jupiter's magnetosphere with as much as 1,000kg of new material every second. Strong volcanic eruptions on Io emit huge amounts <b>of</b> <b>sulfur</b> dioxide, {{a major part of}} which is dissociated into atoms and ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, producing ions <b>of</b> <b>sulfur</b> and oxygen: S+, O+, S2+ and O2+. These ions escape from the satellite's atmosphere and form the Io plasma torus: a thick and relatively cool ring of plasma encircling Jupiter, located near Io's orbit. The plasma temperature within the torus is 10–100eV (100,000–1,000,000K), which is much lower than that of the particles in the radiation belts—10keV (100millionK). The plasma in the torus is forced into co-rotation with Jupiter, meaning both share the same period of rotation. The Io torus fundamentally alters the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E
