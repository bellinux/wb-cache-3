40|$|The {{problem of}} {{producing}} <b>off-graded</b> cottonseed oil using locally produced commercial hexane as extracting solvent has explored this research. It was aimed {{in this work}} to investigate whether this problem can be solved by controlling the boiling range of the extracting solvent. Four different hexane fractions of different boiling ranges were prepared from commercial hexane. The boiling range of commercial hexane was 62 - 68 &# 194;&# 186;C while the boiling ranges of the four fractions were 62 - 64, 64 - 65, 65 - 66 and 66 - 68 &# 194;&# 186;C. Commercial hexane and the prepared four hexane fractions were then used to extract cottonseed oil from a fixed seed sample. The five crude oil samples were then refined and bleached and their colours were measured. The results {{have shown that the}} heaviest hexane fraction (b. r 66 - 68 &# 194;&# 186;C) produced the lightest coloured oils. The colour index of the bleached oil using this heavy cut was 190 compared to 350 using the original commercial hexane. However, the production of a commercial hexane cut having a narrow boiling range will be costly. Therefore, this research has been extended to investigate the suitability of a heavy petroleum cut which has a boiling range as wide as that of commercial hexane to extract cottonseed oil. The boiling range of this cut was 66 - 72 &# 194;&# 186;C. The obtained results proved that the extraction of cottonseed oil using that heavy petroleum fraction produces much lighter oil than the use of conventional hexane solvent. En esta investigaci&# 243;n se ha examinado el problema de producir aceite de semilla de algod&# 243;n sin-clasificar usando hexano comercial producido localmente como disolvente. El objetivo de este trabajo fue investigar si este problema puede ser solucionado controlando el rango de ebullici&# 243;n del disolvente extractante. Cuatro fracciones diferentes de hexano de diversos rangos de ebullici&# 243;n fueron preparadas del hexano comercial. El rango al que ebull&# 237;a el hexano comercial era 62 - 68 &# 194;&# 186;C mientras que los rangos que ebull&# 237;an las cuatro fracciones eran 62 - 64, 64 - 65, 65 - 66 y de 66 - 68 &# 194;&# 186;C. El hexano comercial y las cuatro fracciones de hexano preparadas, fueron luego utilizados para extraer el aceite de semilla de algod&# 243;n de una muestra de semilla concreta. Las cinco muestras de aceite crudo fueron posteriormente refinadas y decoloradas, y medidos sus colores. Los resultados han mostrado que la fracci&# 243;n m&# 225;s pesada del hexano (b. r. 66 - 68 &# 194;&# 186;C) produjo los aceites m&# 225;s claros. El &# 237;ndice del color del aceite decolorado que usaba esta fracci&# 243;n pesada era 190 comparado al 350 obtenido usado por el hexano comercial original. Sin embargo, la producci&# 243;n de una fracci&# 243;n de hexano comercial que tenga un estrecho rango de ebullici&# 243;n ser&# 225; costosa.

Plant with a capacity of 30 tones of FFB yield 7 - 10 % <b>off-grade</b> palm oil or 2 - 3 tons per hour. The catalyst used is potassium hydroxide because it has smaller ionization energy, making it faster to form a product when used as a catalyst. This research aims to produce biodiesel from low-quality raw materials and determine the effectiveness of the process by looking at the effect of process conditions such as reaction temperature, molar ratio and catalyst concentration on the yield of biodiesel. The biodiesel making process was carried out with two stages of the reaction, esterification and transesterification reactions due to high content of free fatty acid in the raw material.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to produce high grade silicon from <b>off-grade</b> {{materials}} like sculls and process slags from Elkem Thamshavn. The methods investigated are dense medium separation, optical separation, flotation and metallurgical separation by remelting. Dense medium separation trials are conducted using magnetite suspended in water and aim to find the suspension density where only one phase will float. Optical separation experiments are done to identify light intensity thresholds between refractories, silicon and slag. The viability of flotation without surface activators and at neutral pH are investigated by measuring the zeta potential of each phase. Remelting experiments are done, building on previous work by the author, {{with the aim of}} investigating whether adding CaO or MgO to the slag will increase the settling efficiency. No results were obtained in the DMS experiments, because the viscosity of the suspension increased to infinity before the density of either slag or silicon was reached. The flotation experiments showed that flotation is not viable at neutral pH without surface activators, as the zeta potential of slag and silicon is nearly identical. The optical separation experiments were a success. The product fraction had an average silicon content of 74 wt%, compared to 52 wt% in the original <b>off-grade</b> material, while the waste fraction contained 7. 5 wt% silicon. The separation efficiency was best for coarser grains, which is the expected result based on theory. The remelting experiments concluded that adding CaO or MgO to the slag will increase the settling efficiency. This was established both by chemical analysis and by surface area analysis of slag samples from each experiment. MgO seemed to contribute more to the settling efficiency than CaO, but because of the large variance between samples, this is not conclusive. The quality of the produced silicon was unaffected or improved by adding CaO, but additions of MgO increased the magnesium content slightly. </p...|$|E

This research investigated the morphology, mechanical behaviors and thermal stability of the blends compared with its virgin materials. The results showed that both impact modifiers could enhance the impact strength of PS. The addition of SEBS resulted in relatively better performances than the SBS counterparts for impact strength and tensile strength. In term of tensile modulus, PS blended with SBS at the content of more than 20 % wt. would be higher than SEBS. From TGA data, both PS/SBS and PS/SEBS blends exhibited better thermal stability than PS itself. PS/SBS blend systems possessed higher thermal stability than the PS/SEBS blend systems...|$|E

The objective {{is to reduce the}} moisture variability in a continuous neutralization reactor by implementing a model-predictive control (MPC) to manipulate the water addition. The acid-base reaction takes place in right balance of raw materials. The moisture control is essential to the reaction yield and avoids downstream process constraints. The first modeling step was to define variables that have statistical correlation and high effect on the predictable one (moisture). Then, it was selected enough historical data that represents the plant operation in long term. Outliers like plant shutdowns, downtimes or non-usual events were removed from the database. The VOA model was built by training the digital control system neural block using those historical data. The MPC was implemented considering constraints and disturbances variables to establish the process control strategy. Constraints were configured to avoid damages in equipments. Disturbances were defined to cause feed forward action. The MPC receives the predictable moisture from VOA and anticipates the water addition control.

40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} processes of high value-added {{products in the}} pharmaceutical, fine chemical polymer and food industry, insufficient control might produce <b>off-grade</b> products. This can cause significant financial losses, or in the pharmaceutical industry, it can result in an unusable batch. In these industries, batch reactors are commonly used, the control of which is essentially a problem of temperature control. In the industry, {{an increasing number of}} heating-cooling systems utilising three different temperature levels can be found, which are advantageous from an economic point of view. However, it makes the control more complicated. This paper presents a split-range designing technique using the model of the controlled system with the aim to design a split-range algorithm more specific to the actual sys- tem. The algorithm described provides high control performance when using it with classical PID-based cascade temperature control of jacketed batch reactors; however, it can be used with or as part of other types of controllers, for ex- ample, model-based temperature controllers. The algorithm can be used in the case of systems where only two as well as where three temperature levels are used for temperature control. Besides the switching between the modes of opera- tion and calculating the value of the manipulated variable, {{one of the most important}} functions of the split-range algo- rithm is to keep the sign of the gain of the controlled system unchanged. However, with a more system-specific split-range solution, not only can the sign of the gain be kept unchanged, but the gain can also be constant or less de- pendent on the state of the system. Using this solution, the design of the PID controller becomes simpler and can be implemented in existing systems without serious changes...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{examined the}} practice of relying on field test item calibrations {{in advance of the}} operational administration of a large scale assessment for purposes of equating and scaling. Often termed âpre-equating,â the effectiveness of this method is explored for a statewide, high-stakes assessment in grades three, five, and seven for the content areas of language arts, mathematics, and social studies. Pre-equated scaling was based on item calibrations using the Rasch model from an <b>off-grade</b> field test event in which students tested were one grade higher than the target population. These calibrations were compared to those obtained from post-equating, which used the full statewide population of examinees. Item difficulty estimates and Test Characteristic Curves (TCC) were compared for each approach and found to be similar. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the theta estimates for each approach ranged from. 02 to. 12. Moreover, classification accuracy for the pre-equated approach was generally high compared to results from post-equating. Only 3 of the 9 tests examined showed differences in the percent of students classified as passing; errors ranged from 1. 7 percent to 3 percent. Measurement equivalence between the field test and operational assessment was also explored using the Differential Functioning of Items and Tests (DFIT) framework. Overall, about 20 to 40 percent of the items on each assessment exhibited statistically significant Differential Item Functioning (DIF). Differential Test Functioning (DTF) was significant for fully 7 tests. There was a positive relationship between the magnitude of DTF and degree of incongruence between pre-equating and post-equating. Item calibrations, score consistency, and measurement equivalence were also explored for a test calibrated with the one, two, and three parameter logistic model, using the TCC equating method. Measurement equivalence and score table incongruence was found to be slightly more pronounced with this approach. It was hypothesized that differences between the field test and operational tests resulted from 1) recency of instruction 2) cognitive growth and 3) motivation factors.

40|$|This thesis study {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of model-based control and optimization for optimal grade transitions in polyethylene solution polymerization processes. To meet the operational need of this particular process and to reduce transition time and <b>off-grade</b> production for economic benefit, four major topics are taken into account: 1) model development, 2) optimization formulations and solution strategies, 3) handling uncertainties, and 4) online implementation. These four parts cover two layers, the real time optimization layer and the advanced control layer, in the decision-making hierarchy of chemical processes. Both of them require detailed mathematical models that are representative of the process and efficient dynamic optimization strategies. First, a detailed mathematical model is developed to capture the dynamic behavior of the process. This includes time delay models for vapor and liquid recycle streams as well as a reduced, yet accurate, vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) model derived from rigorous VLE calculations. Next, two optimization formulations, single stage and multistage, are developed to deal with single-value target and specification bands of product properties, respectively. The results show significant reduction in grade transition time and off-spec production. However, the performance can deteriorate in the presence of uncertainties, disturbances and model mismatch, which calls for robust optimization strategies. In our work, a flowchart is proposed and back-off constraints calculated from Monte Carlo simulations are incorporated in the original optimization problemto generate optimal control policies that can be applied at different uncertainty levels. As an extension of this work, nonlinear model predictive control and state estimation are then considered. An online implementation framework is built up for grade transitions in such processes and can be further extended to other similar processes. For dynamic optimization, simultaneous collocation method is applied to discretize the differential-algebraic equations, and the resulting nonlinear programming (NLP) problems are solved using NLP solvers. Because of the characteristics of the problem, singular control problems are considered and the influence of regularization is discussed for both offline dynamic optimization and optimization under uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|In Scandinavia, sawlogs are {{typically}} sorted upon {{arrival at the}} sawmill. Presorting of sawlogs according to dimension, e. g., using an optical three-dimensional (3 D) scanner, is {{used to make the}} sawing process more efficient. However, since wood is a biological material with large variability, there will be large differences in the quality of wood sawn from different logs of similar size. For some dimensions of sawn goods, wood quality is very important and low grade products will be difficult to sell, while for other dimensions, grade is less important. This means that if the quality of the sawn goods may be predicted before actual sawing takes place, the production of <b>off-grade</b> products, i. e., products not meeting customer demands, may be reduced. Some quality information may be obtained using the outer shape information from a 3 D scanner and more detailed information on the internal quality of the log can be obtained using an X-ray log scanner. Today, the use of X-ray log scanners is becoming increasingly common and most sawmills installing an X-ray scanner already have a 3 D scanner present. This raises the question of possible benefits from combining the X-ray and 3 D scanning techniques. In this thesis, a method has been developed where the log shape measured by the 3 D scanner is utilized to estimate the X-ray path lengths through the wood. This allows the calculation of green density profiles of the log, which may in turn be used to calculate quality variables such as heartwood content and heartwood density. The hypothesis of this project has been that the precision in these variables will be improved by the 3 D path length compensation of the X-ray data. The method has been tested on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sawlogs, using both simulated and industrial log scanner data. Scanners with one and two X-ray directions have been used. The most important conclusions from the project are that: - Heartwood diameter predictions are significantly improved by the combination of 3 D and X-ray data. - Dry and green heartwood densities can be calculated with improved precision relative to scanning using X-ray only. - The method was found suitable for application with both one- and two-directional X-ray scanners. - For a sawmill already using both 3 D and X-ray scanners, there is a large improvement potential available using existing equipment. For sawmills thinking about investing in an X-ray scanner, the possibility of connecting it to the 3 D scanner should make the rate of return of the equipment higher and encourage more sawmills to make this investment.

40|$|Graduation date: 1935 This {{investigation}} was undertaken to determine, from a dietetic standpoint, the amounts and proportions of dextrose, levulose and sucrose present in Bosc pears, and to furnish information {{that might be}} of value {{in the development of}} by-products from the <b>off-grade</b> fruit of this variety. The attempt was made to carry out this work {{in such a way that}} fundamental information might be obtained concerning the physiological changes occuring during growth, storage, and ripening. Such information, it was hoped, might lead to a better understanding of the physiology of pears, and. in addition, shed some light on the dynamics of carbohydrate changes in fruit. The investigation has been carried on for two seasons and may be divided, into three general parts: (1) a study of the physical and chemical changes occuring during the latter stages of growth; (2) a study of the chemical changes occuring during storage; and. (3) a study of the chemical changes occuring during the ripening process. (1) The results of the study of the physical and chemical changes during one growing season show that the amounts of dextrose remain approximately constant during growth while the amounts of levulose increase steadily during most of this period, but decrease markedly during the last week on the tree. Sucrose is present in increasing amounts during the last seven weeks on the tree and increases very rapidly during the last week. (2) The results of the study of the chemical changes as observed during two storage seasons, show that there are marked differences between pears of two successive seasons and that the sugar content of fruit may show quite different changes during storage, depending upon the time of picking. It is apparent, however, that levu 1 ose increases during storage, in most cases, and that dextrose either remains constant or increases slightly. The behavior of sucrose appears to depend, to a considerable extent, upon the time of picking. (3) The results of the study of the ripening of pears show that chemical changes took place during ripening of fruit that attained prime eating condition, which are quite different than those which were observed during the ripening of fruit which developed mediocre eating quality. These changes were studied during two seasons and indicate that the conditions associated with the inversion of sucrose during ripening are correlated with the physical and. chemical changes involved in attaining good. eating quality. The chemical changes involved in ripening include a hydrolysis of some undetermined carbohydrate to yield sucrose which may or may not be inverted. Levulose increases in all cases, while dextrose either remains constant or increases, depending upon the extent of inversion of sucrose. The identity of the material yielding the increasing amounts of sugars, observed in ripening, was not determined. It is suggested that the substance is a soluble non-sugar carbohydrate which is transformed into sugar during the ripening process...|$|E

RISK FACTORS AND STRUCTURE OF OBSTETRIC AND PERINATAL COMPLICATIONS IN WOMAN, WHICH ILL OF PYELONEPHRITIS (Review of literature and results of own researches) M. Yu. Golubenko Odesa National Medical University Abstract Actuality. Morbidity on a pyelonephritis and complication of motion of pregnancy is the important indicators of the state of health of woman population and baby that determines social meaningfulness of this problem. Research aim. To learn data of anamnesis of illness, life, professional features, domestic and surrounding environment, data of somatic status and to set forth leading risk of origin of placenta disfunction factors for pregnant, patients with a pyelonephritis. Material and methods. On the basis of retrospective analysis there are 20779 histories of illnesses of women, patients with a pyelonephritis, the study of risk of forming of somatic pathology of women and development of placenta disfunction factors is conducted with the aim of warning of complications of pregnancy and pathology of fetal and child. Results of researches. Research of the somatic state of pregnant that are ill a chronic pyelonephritis showed the presence of concomitant pathology in 100 % cases, from that the diseases of the cardiovascular system laid down 61, 5 %, endocrine violations 50, 2 %, the dyspepsia phenomena and gastroenterology pathology 40, 5 %. The structure of obstetric, perinatal complications for women with a chronic pyelonephritis (20779 supervisions) included: early toxicosis (65, 5 %), placental dysfunction (73, 3 %), an eclampsia (78, 3 %), threat of abortion (76, 1 %) and premature luing-ins (56, 2 %), subzero placentation (76, 1 %), high water-level (76, 7 %), gestational anaemia (67, 8 %), delay of height of fetal (17, 1 %), chronic fetal distress (21, 3 %), premature removing layer by layer of placenta (26, 3 %); in luing-ins: premature outpouring of near of fetal waters (22, 4 %), weakness of childbirth (72, 3 %), obstetric bleeding (47, 1 %); in a puerperium: subinvolution of uterus (26, 3 %). Conclusion. Thus, executed by us research in relation to the study of morbidity and prevalence of pyelonephritis among pregnant allowed to set the following: placenta disfunction in the period of pregnancy registered oneself in 100 % habitants of districts with a row by quality of drinking-water, in 90 % patients with cardiovascular pathology, in 62, 1 % with passion to smoking and on a background considerable gas is muddy air contamination of environment, in 41, 9 % pregnant, that abuse of alcohol, in 37, 9 % with an <b>off-grade</b> feed, in 27, 6 % as a result of chronic stress, chronic fatigueability, influence of microwave irradiation. The above-stated factors are leading risk of origin of placenta disfunction factors for pregnant, with ill of pyelonephritis. Ðey words: pyelonephritis, risk of origin of placenta disfunction factors for pregnan...|$|E
