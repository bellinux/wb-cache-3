40|$|New {{double-glazed}} window systems {{based on}} the possibility of reversing the window through its sash could be in a short time a reality. Actually, the windows on the market are normally reversible to a partly open position for cleaning purposes, lowering the maintenance costs. But they could also have a fundamental role in the energy performance of buildings, if realised with two different panes, an absorbing one and clear one, and if they could operate as closed windows in both normal and reversed positions. The position of the absorbing pane influences their thermal behaviour, saving a quantity of energy if the tinted pane faces indoor in the heating season and outdoor in the cooling season. The solar filtering behaviour in fact is required in summer, to reduce the penetration of solar radiation to the indoor environment, while the solar heat gain behaviour is required in winter to minimize the heating consumption, making use of the solar energy. The problem linked to the "new" system is the winter overheating due to the solar gain behaviour: indoor temperatures could become uncomfortable if not <b>controlled.</b> But the <b>overheating</b> <b>control</b> could reduce the expected energy savings in a manner that depends on the used systems and strategies. This paper analyses the energy savings connected to the potential use of the reversible windows in several Italian locations, representatives of Mediterranean climate, for buildings with no-prevalent cooling or heating requirements. Different strategies to <b>control</b> indoor winter <b>overheating</b> are analysed with their implications in energy consumption and room thermal comfort for reversible windows.

40|$|Abstract- Turnout {{equipment}} plays a {{vital role}} in the safe operation of railroad systems. It is of great importance in ensuring safety and punctuality, and in the smooth operation of point switching mechanisms. Failure of switching gear due to climatic conditions at their site of installation is a frequent occurrence, in particular, breakdown resulting from the effects of snow and ice or of piled-up snow. To prevent this happening, heating equipment can be installed {{to get rid of the}} ice and snow. Generally speaking, a point heater comprises a heating system, an electricity supply unit, and various kinds of sensor. However, overheating sometimes occurs owing to failures caused by inadequate sensor installation, resulting in the heater becoming unusable. Therefore, a converter is proposed to prevent this <b>overheating</b> by <b>controlling</b> the electricity supply to the heater while detecting the ambient temperature without the use of such sensors...|$|R
40|$|Pneumatic clear foil cushion systems, notably as ETFE foil {{cushions}} {{have been}} developed as an alternative technology to large-scale glass glazing systems for wide-span buildings. The systems display better thermal performance and have advantages of extremely low dead-weight constructions compared to conventional glazing systems, and thereby the increasing popularity of foil cushion cladding systems have been witnessed in the last decades. However due to their lightweight and thinness, the thermal behaviour of architectural foil membranes exhibits a high responsiveness to variations in external conditions. For this reason, {{it is argued that}} the reliable prediction of the thermal environment experienced in a space enclosed by a tensile membrane skin construction would require a bespoke modelling of the dynamic thermal behaviour of such a construction at first. Building envelopes clad with such cushions, such as the famous Eden project in the UK, need a dynamic system to <b>control</b> <b>overheating</b> in summer. A cooling liquid layer constructed within a clear multi-layer toil cushion envelope is proposed in this thesis. It enables rapid cooling effects on the building envelope. The system is based on an evaporative cooling mechanism and is integrated with the inflated cushion to provide desired cooling effect eco-friendly. The implications of the forms and configurations of clear foil cushion constructions with and without a cooling liquid layer in the <b>overheating</b> <b>control</b> were evaluated in this research project. Data were collected from a series of experiments to ascertain the effects of the additional cooling water layer on heat transfer processes within the foil skin construction. The results demonstrated that the thermal behaviour of a foil penal depended mainly on surface convection and radiation heat transfer and the cooling performance of the water layer within the foil skin constructions was evident. The initial experimental outcomes were valuable for the design of such novel dynamic cooling systems. In order to assess the effect that different pneumatic foil skin constructions with a water layer might have on thermal conditions inside the enclosed space, the thermal behaviour of full-scale indoor double-layer foil cushion enclosure and triple-layer foil skin construction, with varying evaporative cooling integrative ways and foil skin constructions, were tested {{during the course of this}} research. The test datasets were compared according to the research objectives and with the environmental control strategy proposed at the initial design stages. The investigated thermal behaviour of the foil skin constructions incorporating a water layer serves as a reference basis for the analytic modelling of the tested double and triple-layer foil skin constructions in order to predict their surface temperatures and the solar radiation directed into the space they enclose. The approach is based on a detailed modelling of the radiative and convective heat transfer processes affecting the membrane surfaces. These prediction results derived from the model were compared against the environmental data obtained on the test rigs. The developed analytical model is only tentative, as some thermal transfer processes, such as long wave radiation exchanges between the foil sheets, have not been accounted for in this model. Further work is required to develop this model in order to appreciate the thermal performance of such novel foil cushion constructions more precisely and extend their building applications.

40|$|Food {{security}} is a significant issue in the remote, high altitude areas of Nepal. Malnutrition is common because the harsh climate restricts production and access to fresh food. Humla is a province in north-west Nepal where the severe weather conditions and limited arable land restrict the growing season of vegetables to only 4 - 5 months a year. Passive solar greenhouses are a technology {{that can be used}} to extend the growing period of vegetables. For the greenhouse to be effective in Humla, the design must be appropriate to the climatic conditions, available resources and the social requirements of the community. This paper describes the design and evaluation of a family-sized solar greenhouse proposed for Humla. Three solar greenhouses built in other high altitude areas have initially been reviewed to see what techniques might be replicated in Humla. The thermal performance of the proposed family-sized greenhouse has been predicted using the solar simulation software, TRNSYS, and compared against an existing design in the area.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{buildings}} following sustainable criteria comprehends several aspects {{focusing on a}} worldwide vision of rational energy use. From {{this point of view}} lowering HVAC energy demand and pollutant emissions are fundamental. These targets can be reached by using renewable energy sources or high efficiency heat pumps and chillers, and by the adoption of bio-materials. This paper describes the design study underlying three sustainable buildings under construction in Arzignano (Vicenza), Italy. These buildings are characterized by an energy efficient HVAC system, and an high-insulation building envelope. The building has a net air-conditioned and heated area and volume of 310 m 2 and 830 m 3 respectively. The envelope opaque components are designed according to national law criteria, the thermal transmittance towards external environments are lower than 0. 30 W/(m 2 •K); the windows have a U-value lower than 1. 5 W/(m 2 •K) (two-panes glasses with Argon cavity gas). These values are obtained adopting innovative and bio-sustainable materials like the foam-glass. The heating/cooling system consists in an air-to-water heat pump coupled with a floor radiant system and a mechanical ventilation system provided with an active energy recovery from exhaust air coupled with a earth-to-air heat exchanger. The building solar passive characteristics have also been considered in the design phase to allow the highest heat gains during wintertime while the summer <b>overheating</b> is <b>controlled</b> by shading systems.

40|$|A smart heating {{controller}} has a twofold objective: to save as {{much energy}} as possible while maintaining an acceptable comfort level in the building. Due to very large time constants in the building response, it has to anticipate internal and external disturbances. In the case of a passive solar commercial building, the need for anticipation is reinforced by important solar and internal gains. Indeed, large solar gains increase the energy savings potential but also the <b>overheating</b> risk. Optimal <b>control</b> theory presents an ideal formalism to solve this problem : its principle is to anticipate the building behaviour using a model and a forecasting of the disturbances in order to compute the control sequence that minimises a given cost function over the optimisation horizon. This cost function can combine comfort level and energy consumption. This paper presents the application of optimal control to auxiliary heating of a passive solar commercial building. Simulation-based and experimental results show that it can lead to significant energy savings while maintaining or improving the comfort level in this type of building. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{empirical}} {{evidence on the}} factors that motivated emerging economies to change their capital outflow controls in recent decades. Liberalization of capital outflow controls can allow emerging-market economies (EMEs) to reduce net capital inflow (NKI) pressures, but may cost their governments the fiscal revenues that external financial repression generates. Our results indicate that external repression revenues in EMEs declined substantially in the 2000 s compared with the 1980 s. In line with this decline in external repression revenues and their growth accelerations in the 2000 s, concerns related to net capital inflows took predominance over fiscal concerns in the decisions to liberalize capital outflow <b>controls.</b> <b>Overheating</b> and foreign exchange valuation concerns arising from NKI pressures were important, but so were financial stability concerns and concerns about macroeconomic volatility.

Two laboratories and a ‘control ward’ were applied. Lab- 2 was a renovation of an existing room in a manner that could correct an existing nursery. Lab- 1 was an entirely new building idea.

30|$|The {{opposite}} {{use case}} {{in the area of}} thermal comfort is cooling of a space during summer season. With an intelligent control system considering knowledge of weather data as well as building design and shape, the existing energy savings potentials in the field of artificial air cooling can be exploited. If, for example, the weather forecast for the night predicts cool temperatures, the system could drop an artificial cooling strategy in favor of ambient air cooling, in order to lower the temperature in the building. This technique, also known as night purge, of course has to be performed in accordance to the occupancy of the building. The temperature of unoccupied rooms can be brought down to a reasonable level while keeping it on a comfortable value in occupied rooms. Also in this case the thermal inertia can be considered by cooling down the room to a lower temperature than necessary and counterbalance this with stored day-heat in the building hull. This activity therefore also performs a natural chilling of the building envelope. If the night WeatherSituation in addition is calm (e.g., no thunderstorms, wind), also natural ventilation can be taken into account by opening windows. Of course an appropriate security policy has to be followed in order to avert burglary. Another possibility to prevent the building from summer <b>overheating</b> is intelligent <b>control</b> of shutters and blinds: closing shutters in unoccupied rooms can create an additional layer of insulation against sun-rays and therefore lower the sun's impact on room temperature.|$|R

Thus, overheating is a paramount problem in residential buildings. Although air conditioning can solve this problem, it will consume {{a large amount of}} electricity and also causes environmental problems. Moreover, the concern of sick building syndrome has resulted in a resurgence of interest in naturally ventilated rooms. The action of opening a window is the most intuitive and simple response to <b>controlling</b> <b>overheating</b> in a room. Even so, if the window opening dimension is not properly designed, direct sunlight through the window will contribute by far the largest heat gain in houses. The survival of vernacular houses especially in the tropics should be reviewed to identify window design strategies that had been applied for natural ventilation and daylight. This study provides an evaluation on the window design performance in urban area and evaluation of impact of microclimate on indoor thermal comfort of the inhabitants based on case study on a selected British Colonial residences in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The result suggests optimum window design for similar residences in urban area. The evaluation was conducted based on the calculation of window to wall ratio, field measurement, and simulation test using AIOLOS. Architecture and window design approaches of the selected residences were analyzed and the data collected from each residence were applied in the calculation of window to wall ratio. The validations of the window to wall ratio were then examined by field measurement and simulation using AIOLOS software.

Angesichts dieser Tatsachen wurde in dieser Untersuchung ein Konzept zu einer Typenprüfung von Lichtpolymerisationsgeräten erarbeitet.

ENGLISH: With {{the spread}} of light polymerisation in dentistry for curing light-activated filling and luting materials the visible-light curing unit has become a standard device in the dental office. The light intensity is the main factor for the degree of polymerisation. However, {{there are other factors}} like comfort, handling and intensity control influencing daily use. The light curing unit industry is large and always changing. Consumer information is rare and often out of date. Considering these facts the present study presents a concept of investigating light curing units. In a further study all light curing units available on the Swiss market will be investigated using this protocol. Newly released light curing units should be investigated in this manner to actualize the existing results. Initially specifications and features are summarised using a questionnaire. Several tests are performed to investigate the parameters of the units. The light intensity emitted from the curing tip is analysed by the radiant power, the radiance and the light distribution across the face of the light curing tip as a function of time. Precise radiometers and a camera for picture processing are used for these measurements. Density filters are used to reduce the radiant power. The measurements of the precise radiometer are compared with those of the integrated radiometer of the light-curing unit. In this way the precision of integrated radiometers is controlled at maximum and reduced output. For evaluating the presence and the quality of integrated voltage stabilizer, the line voltage is varied from 230 V down to 207 V and up to 244 V and the radiant power is measured. The integrated timer is measured for its accuracy in each unit. The time intervals are controlled using a stopwatch. Finally the cooling device is tested. Using a phonometer the noise of the cooling fan is measured. Furthermore, the <b>overheating</b> protector is <b>controlled</b> by recording the activating and resetting time...|$|R

The main objective is to face the discomfort, consequent to the heat island effect and heavy traffic, acting both on private and public spaces with environmentally sustainable strategies. The two main topics are: At urban level, the use of an Italian prescriptive tool: the "Environmental Island" for improving sustainability and liveability of Testaccio public spaces and streets. Strategies aimed at eliminating through traffic, at reducing local traffic flow and at taming its speed, at increasing permeable surfaces and “green and blue” features, at promoting sustainable transport modes help to increase besides accessibility and safety, comfort. They indeed reduce atmospheric, acoustic and visual pollution as well as overheating, making thus pedestrian and bike networks become attractive even to older and vulnerable people, otherwise threatened by health problems and stress. At block level, the upgrading of semi-public and private spaces by deep energy retrofit and use of bioclimatic solutions in order to improve buildings efficiency and thence to reduce their environmental impact on outdoor spaces. Strategies aimed at decreasing gas consumptions and emissions and at increasing evaporative cooling and green features help to <b>control</b> <b>overheating</b> and air pollution. The research was carried out by academic staff together with students of the Course “City & Environment”, of the Master Degree in Urban Design (first topic) and with architects attending a post degree course in Eco-sustainable Design (second topic). At urban level, after in depth analyses and assessments, made using methods developed and tested in previous European research, applied also in other areas of Rome, maps were drawn showing were and how to act in order to solve problems detected both as experts and by residents. Connections were made among different aspects in order to study their interrelation with the aim to find solutions solving more problems at one time: traffic and activities in relation to air pollution and noise, to materials used on streets and façades, to green features, to the most used pedestrian paths etc. For the assessment specific thresholds were used with reference to laws, standards and recommendations. Congruent interventions were proposed focusing on innovative technological devices and natural materials.
