As the role of part-time faculty {{in colleges and universities}} has evolved and gained prominence, it is increasingly important to gain a deeper understanding of their perceptions of job involvement considered as potential predictor of turnover and absenteeism. There are very few studies focusing on part-time faculty. Available research tends to be concerned with inequality in terms of income, benefits, working conditions, and opportunities for career advancement compared to full-time faculty, while perceptions of how distributive justice among part-time faculty members might be associated with their perceived levels of job involvement remain comparatively neglected. This study focused on exploring relationships between job involvement and <b>other</b> <b>job-related</b> variables, including perceived levels of distributive justice; whether or not part-time work status was voluntary or involuntary, or the position was primary or non-primary. Perceived levels of overqualified underemployment and perception of empowerment were also considered. The study population was drawn from an existing database.

40|$|Understanding {{labor market}} dynamics, {{especially}} {{in developing countries}} has become a central issue {{in light of the}} global financial crises of 2008. This study analyzed labor markets in four developing countries: China, Colombia, Egypt and Sierra Leone to estimate determinants of the labor force participation, wages, and willingness to pay for job-related benefits. It then quantified the monetary values of job benefits through the contingent valuation (CV) method. For the analysis, logistic, OLS, and Tobit models were used. The results of the logistic regression analysis revealed that gender, age, age-squared, marriage, household head, and difficult health were statistically significant determinants of the labor force participation in all countries. The study confirmed the findings of previous literature that women tend to have lower labor force participation than men. The impact of tertiary education on labor force participation was also positive and significant in Colombia and Egypt. Moreover, chronic and prolonged health problems precluded labor force participation in all the countries. The study unsurprisingly has shown that heads of household had extremely higher participation in all the countries. On the other hand, marriage only increased labor force participation in China and Sierra Leone, whereas it actually decreased in Egypt and Colombia. Location played a role in labor force participation as urban areas had significantly lower participation in China and Sierra Leone. Furthermore, results from the OLS regression analysis showed that gender, wealth and higher educational attainment were main determinants of wages. There was a gender pay differential between women and men in all countries, except Sierra Leone. Higher education significantly and positively affected wages in Colombia, Egypt and Sierra whereas it was insignificant in China. The results also demonstrated that the impact of wealth on wages was significant and positive in all countries, supporting the hypothesis that individuals with higher status are able to garner higher wages. Similarly, results from the Tobit model revealed that income, household size, location, gender and education played a role in determining willingness- to-pay (WTP) for social security and <b>other</b> <b>job-related</b> benefits. The impact of income on WTP for health insurance, pension benefits, and permanent contract was significant and positive for most countries. Men were also found to have slightly greater WTP for social benefits. The impact of education on WTP differed among countries and the types of benefits, and no clear patterns emerged. Finally, the analysis of contingent valuation data showed that China consistently had a lower mean WTP for social benefits than Sierra Leone and Egypt; 2 - 5 % and 4 - 20 % of monthly income, respectively. The same pattern emerged for their willingness-to-accept (WTA) loss for job-related benefits. The study has also illustrated that individuals in all the countries, who participate in social security programs, as well as <b>other</b> <b>job-related</b> benefits, demanded a substantial increase in income, in terms of WTA compensation for losing access to social benefits. On the other hand, those, without social security systems and benefits were willing to contribute a significant amount of their monthly income to participate. M-ECO...|$|R

We assessed the accuracy of intravaginal swabs transported by mail in a wet versus a dry state for PCR (Amplicor CT/NG test) detection of chlamydia and gonorrhea infections in a cross-sectional study of 793 active-duty military women attending an STD clinic. PCR tests of vaginal swabs (wet and dry) were compared to local clinical methods used on cervical swabs. Standard wet vaginal swab PCR testing detected more chlamydia (11. 6 %) than cervical enzyme immunoassay (9. 3 %). For detection of chlamydia using wet swabs, the sensitivity and specificity compared with adjudicated true positives were 94. 6 % (87 of 92) and 99. 3 % (696 of 701), respectively. Comparing dry swabs to true-positives for chlamydia, the sensitivity was 91. 3 % (84 of 92) and the specificity was 99. 3 % (696 of 701). Standard wet vaginal swab PCR detected more gonorrhea (3. 3 %) than routine cervical culture (2. 1 %).

40|$|On {{the basis}} of its main {{theoretical}} premise: that the form of ownership makes a difference for economic performance because its imposes a system of ownership-specific incentives, the property rights theory argues that the fundamental difference in ownership rights between {{the public and private sectors}} lies in the inability of a public owner to sell his share of public ownership, and, consequently, the relationship between one person's wealth and his activities is much weaker under public ownership. As a consequence, the incentive of any individual public owner to monitor the behaviour of decision makers in public enterprises is weaker as compared with the incentive in private firms. The dissipation of value through slack attention and <b>other</b> <b>job-related</b> perks is therefore a characteristic phenomenon in the public sector. In addition, efficiency incentives for public enterprise managers are bound to be feeble due to the difficulty in linking their compensation to financial performance. However, there is little evidence to suggest a correlation between share prices and performance of companies. The argument of the property rights theory bases on the role of the capital market. In a number of highly successful, advanced market economies (such as Japan or Germany), however, both the stock market and the mechanism of hostile takeovers play a relatively minor role as instruments of monitoring the managers by shareholders. These models of market economy are not far from the model of efficient bureaucratic control exercised by the state. More broadly, it might be argued that separation of ownership from control (and management) is just as advanced in largely privately owned corporations as in public enterprises.

The {{aim of this study}} was thus to evaluate the two-semester university course for health and hospital management offered by the University of Innsbruck since 1994. METHODS: A structured telephone survey was conducted to poll the participants (n = 184) of previous courses concerning time invested, cost-benefit ratio, quality of the course as well as implementation of course content. RESULTS: The university courses (n = 7) for health and hospital management of the University of Innsbruck evaluated in this study were rated in the upper half of the of the five-part scale (scores 2 to 3) for overall quality, cost-benefit ratio and implementation of course content. Only approx. 25 % of the course participants reported that the course had a positive influence on their career. The relatively high course fee was borne in part by the local hospital operator, a fact that had a certain influence on the selection of course participants. Participation in the course was largely made possible by exemptions from job duties (approx. 75 %) {{and to a lesser extent}} by vacation time (approx. 20 %) or time off for overtime (approx. 5 %). Of total absences from the course (3. 18 +/- 3. 41 d) 75 % was for <b>job-related</b> <b>reasons,</b> 6 % for illness and 19 % for other reasons. Overall, participants were absent more often, the larger the number of personnel in their department or clinic. CONCLUSION: All in all, the courses were considered important and recommendable, particularly with regard to communication, organization, time management and cost awareness. Streamlining (i. e. more content in less time), stronger practical orientation and a switch from mainly local to more international speakers would be important steps toward improving course quality. Thanks to its demonstrated quality, it can be said that the university course for health and hospital management held by the University of Innsbruck and evaluated in this study is certainly a worthwhile course offered in a still emerging market, namely one that will come under increasing pressure from the candidates for executive positions in the health professions to provide what is best for their careers and the health services industry in genera...|$|R
