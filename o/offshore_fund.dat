David Cameron argued that the fund was set up in Panama so that people who wanted to invest in dollar-denominated shares and companies could do so, and because full UK tax was paid on all profits he made there was no impropriety. Thousands of protesters held two marches in London in April 2016 to demand Cameron's resignation.|$|E

50|$|Similarly, {{although}} {{the reference to}} fund {{can be taken to}} include any sort of collective investment, within offshore jurisdictions themselves, the term <b>offshore</b> <b>fund</b> is often limited to purely open-ended investment funds (i.e. a fund where the investor can redeem his investment during the life of the fund) where the investment is by way of equity (rather than by debt). This is often because closed-ended investment funds (where the investor cannot redeem out), and funds where the investment is structured by way of debt, are not normally subject to the usual regulatory requirements for investments funds, and so are not treated as funds in the stricter sense of that word.|$|E
