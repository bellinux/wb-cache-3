5|$|Most fungi {{have both}} a haploid and a diploid stage {{in their life}} cycles. In sexually {{reproducing}} fungi, compatible individuals may combine by fusing their hyphae together into an interconnected network; this process, anastomosis, {{is required for the}} initiation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> cycle. Many ascomycetes and basidiomycetes go through a dikaryotic stage, in which the nuclei inherited from the two parents do not combine immediately after cell fusion, but remain separate in the hyphal cells (see heterokaryosis).|$|E

Groups of Han set upon Uyghur co-workers, leading to at least two Uyghurs being killed (although other reports indicate a higher death toll), and some 118 people injured, most of them Uyghurs.|$|E

The same rules are applied in these cases as the existing body of law on incitement.|$|E

5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E

40|$|A {{long term}} study on <b>the</b> {{reproductive}} strategies <b>of</b> Formica lugubris (Formica rufa group) has revealed many new important facts. Within a supercolony the sex-ratio is strongly female biased. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexuals</b> mate on <b>the</b> nest surface, whereas others fly from <b>the</b> nest. Those <b>sexuals</b> participating in flights aggregate in particular meadow sites (mating places). On these places females attract males by releasing a sex pheromone...|$|R
5|$|House sparrows can {{breed in}} the {{breeding}} season immediately following their hatching, and sometimes {{attempt to do}} so. Some birds breeding {{for the first time}} in tropical areas are only a few months old and still have juvenile plumage. Birds breeding for the first time are rarely successful in raising young, and reproductive success increases with age, as older birds breed earlier in the breeding season, and fledge more young. As the breeding season approaches, hormone releases trigger enormous increases in the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> organs and changes in day length lead males to start calling by nesting sites. The timing of mating and egg-laying varies geographically, and between specific locations and years because a sufficient supply of insects is needed for egg formation and feeding nestlings.|$|E
5|$|The most {{extensive}} early study of female homosexuality {{was provided by}} the Institute for Sex Research, who published an in-depth report <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> experiences of American women in 1953. More than 8,000 women were interviewed by Alfred Kinsey and the staff of the Institute for Sex Research in a book titled Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report. The Kinsey Report's dispassionate discussion of homosexuality as a form of human sexual behavior was revolutionary. Up to this study, only physicians and psychiatrists studied sexual behavior, and almost always the results were interpreted with a moral view.|$|E
5|$|While Vali's {{acquisition}} of Ruma— elder brother taking his younger sister-in-law as wife—is universally condemned; however as in Tara's case, elder brother's widow marrying her younger brother-in-law {{seems to be}} a social norm. Ramashraya Sharma considers that Rama's silence on marriage of Tara and Sugriva does not signal non-acceptance of the act, but rather that he is not concerned with the issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> relations of the loose charactered vanaras, in which Tara and Ruma exchange hands between the brothers. Ramayana mentions that Sugriva indulges in sexual pleasures of women, including Ruma and Tara, who he coveted. In Ramayana however, Angada criticizes Sugriva for his lustful marriage to his elder sister-in-law Tara, who is like a mother to him. Though a political marriage, Tara serves Sugriva loyally.|$|E

5|$|Writing in {{the journal}} Social Problems, Jessica Fields {{characterized}} Not in Front of the Children as a significant monograph which effectively criticized the rhetoric of protection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> purity of youths {{as a form of}} ideology. Cynthia A. McDaniel wrote in a piece for the journal Counterpoints assessing that Heins had put forth a thesis that attempting to shield youths from events led to negative unintended consequences. McDaniel emphasized that rationale debate is key to a functional society which values freedom of choice. She wrote that debate and introspection were critical to growth in this area, {{in order to determine the}} need to modify behavior patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{witnesses}} took {{ten hours}} to testify, {{during which time}} the court sat continuously. After a short break, the judge began his summing up, taking two hours to charge the jury. The judge urged the jury to put their prejudice at hearing that Thornton had sex with Ashford out of their heads; they were here to determine if Thornton was guilty of the offence charged. He pointed out to the jury the lack of concealment exhibited by Thornton, his admission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexual</b> act and of being with Ashford until 4a.m. The judge told them {{it was not possible}} for Thornton to have committed the acts alleged by the prosecution and still have made it to the Holden farm {{by the time he was}} seen by Heydon, and stressed that Thornton did not act like a man who ran. The judge concluded by reminding the jury that it was better a murderer go free than an innocent man be convicted.|$|E
