To define the clusters, a mixed hierarchical and non hierarchical (K-means) procedure was used and <b>the</b> similarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants was measured by Euclidean distance. Because this distance is considered sensitive to <b>the</b> scale measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variables,</b> standardized <b>variables</b> were therefore used.
