Taking advantage of this ability, it grants overseas organizations to increase better quality services at practical costs. [...] The Indian National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) estimated the total market size of the KPO sector in India in 2006 to be $1.5 billion. The year before, 2005, it had been $1.3 billion, with Evalueserve predicting that by 2010 it would be some $10 to $15 billion. The Indian government was predicting that by 2010 India would have 15% of the global KPO market. However, the global financial crisis, coupled with domestic economic problems such as the IPO of Reliance Power in 2009, caused people to re-evaluate these predictions, incurring worries that India's IT, BPO, and KPO sectors [...] - [...] which by then, combined, were $8.4 billion in export revenues [...] - [...] would be greatly affected by these factors.

Latham Street through the town of Clarkton, where the highway intersects NC 211 (Green Street) and CSX's Wilmington Subdivision.

The highway continues north to Elizabethtown, on the southern edge <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>US</b> 701 intersects and becomes concurrent with NC 242 and has a junction with NC 87, which bypasses the town to the south. The U.S. Highway passes through town as Poplar Street, which intersects NC 87 Business in the center of town; there, NC 41 joins US 701 and NC 242 as they exit the town on a four-lane divided highway that crosses the Cape Fear River. North - south NC 242 splits from US 701 and NC 41 at the same three-way intersection east - west NC 53 joins the highways to pass through Bladen Lakes State Forest, which is named for several Carolina Bays known collectively as the Bladen Lake Group. US 701, NC 41, and NC 53 head east as a two-lane road to the town of White Lake, which surrounds the namesake lake.

In contrast to chemokine receptors, many vGPCRs signal in a ligand-independent (constitutive) manner. Such constitutive signaling is of major significance because various pathologies {{are associated with}} activating GPCR mutations. Constitutive activity of the human herpesvirus 8 -encoded GPCR (ORF 74), for example, is essential for its oncogenic potential to cause angioproliferative Kaposi's sarcoma-like lesions.

This article utilizes interviews with former Australian policy-makers to analyze {{the credibility of the}} United States to defend Australian forces during the 1999 INTERFET intervention in East Timor. While there was no direct threat to Australian sovereignty, the episode stoked concerns in Canberra regarding the willingness of Washington to come to Australia's assistance. The Howard government coveted a US tripwire force presence, and the Clinton administration's unwillingness to provide this raised serious concerns among Australian political elites about the alliance. While this says little about the separate question of whether Washington would use nuclear or conventional weapons in defense of Australian sovereignty, the Timor case indicates the existence of an extended deterrence credibility deficit regarding the more probable low-intensity conflicts that Australia finds itself in. 26 page(s...|$|E
