5|$|Kulintang {{music was}} also crucial in {{relation}} to courtships due to {{the very nature of}} Islamic custom, which did not allow for unmarried men and women to intermingle. Traditionally, unmarried daughters were kept in a special chamber in the attic called a lamin, off-limit to visitors and suitors. It was <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was allowed to play during kulintang performances that suitors were allowed to view her. Because of this, kulintang music was rare socially approved vehicles for interaction among the sexes.|$|E

After only a month playing the sport, Taylor was selected for the New South Wales team that competed at the 2009 National Championships, where she was the second leading scorer in what was her first major competition. Playing again for New South Wales, she competed in the 2011 National Championships, and was named the tournament's MVP.

5|$|While {{traveling}} in Mexico, Scripps met María Pilar Arellanos, of Cancún, and married her in 1980. They travelled together {{for two years}} until 1982, when {{he was sentenced to}} a three-year jail term for theft, burglary and resisting arrest. His imprisonment upset María, and their relationship was further soured when he ran away from jail during home leave in June 1985—just months short of completing his term—and burgled again. He was sentenced to another three years' imprisonment, during which she filed for divorce and married Police Constable Ken Cold, an officer in the Royal Protection Squad. This angered Scripps, who acted in revenge, stealing some of Cold's clothing while released on home leave. He was appeased <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> divorced her new husband and returned to her hometown. After he was released, Scripps legally changed his name to John Martin.|$|E

25|$|Colonel Maurice Buckmaster {{ignored the}} message as {{unreliable}} {{because he did}} not know who Olschanezky was. As a result, German transmissions from Inayat Khan’s radio continued to be treated as genuine, leading to the unnecessary deaths of SOE agents, including Olschanezky herself, who was executed at Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp on 6 July 1944. When Vera Atkins investigated the deaths of missing SOE agents, she initially confused Inayat Khan with Olschanezky (they were similar in appearance), who was unknown to her, believing that Inayat Khan had been killed at Natzweiler, correcting the record <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> discovered Inayat Khan’s fate at Dachau.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Wong {{graduated}} from the school and was soon successfully enrolled at the University of Hong Kong studying social work.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s {{the work of}} Emily Kngwarreye, from the Utopia {{community}} north east of Alice Springs, became very popular. Although she {{had been involved in}} craftwork for most of her life, it was <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was in her 80s that she was recognised as a painter. Her works include Earth's Creation. Her styles, which changed every year, have been seen as a mixture of traditional Aboriginal and contemporary Australian. Her rise in popularity has prefigured that of many Indigenous artists from central, northern and western Australia, such as Kngwarreye's niece Kathleen Petyarre, Minnie Pwerle, Dorothy Napangardi, Lena Pwerle, Angelina Ngale (Pwerle) and dozens of others, all of whose works have become highly sought-after. The popularity of these often elderly artists, and the resulting pressure placed upon them and their health, has become such an issue that some art centres have stopped selling these artists' paintings online, instead placing prospective clients on a waiting list for work.|$|E

25|$|Petrović quickly {{noticed that}} Stublić's slight build and running {{efficiency}} made her naturally suited to competing over longer distances, rather than middle-distance events she had focused on. In particular, Stublić {{had already started}} to develop back problems, caused by the strain of running 3000 meters steeplechase, her favorite event. At first, she was very reserved towards Petrović's suggestion to try the marathon. Still, in December 2008, after only {{three and a half}} months of work with her new coach, she set a national record in half marathon. She was finally convinced <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> tried to run for three straight hours in a training session, and found that it was not as difficult or tedious as she expected. Already the top Croatian female distance runner by the end of 2008, having set the season's best marks in 3000 meters, 3000 meters steeplechase, 5000 meters, 10,000 meters and half marathon, Stublić made an agreement with her coach to maintain the focus on the track events in 2009, but to start preparing for the marathon in the autumn of 2009, with the goal of qualifying for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The 2009 season was successful for Stublić, as she topped the national year rankings in the same five events again, setting national records over 3000 meters steeplechase and 5000 meters in the process.|$|E
25|$|Once {{a devoted}} and bright faerie, she {{questioned}} the King {{as to why}} a faerie like herself was not permitted to visit him as often and freely as Oran. The King responds by saying that she and Oran are different by birth, and faery as lowly as Seraphina can not possibly compare herself with Oran. This left Seraphina jealous and determine to best Oran, {{no matter what it}} took, and constantly strove towards what ever goal Oran was headed to. She tricks Oran into staying on Earth by ordering Goodfellow to lead Sindo to the bathing spring, then altering the barrier that was supposed to hide them from humans so that Oran's gown was exposed for stealing. Seraphina uses the opportunity to achieve her ambitions and become the Queen of Avalon. Unfortunately, she is rejected again and again by the King, who constantly reminds Seraphina that no matter how hard she works, even after she becomes a 1st class faerie, she will never compare to Oran because Seraphina simply tries too hard to be something Oran comes by naturally. When Pain and Fanta arrive in Avalon, Seraphina appears again to eliminate Pain only to find that he is powerful enough to detect her spells with ease. Oreadia eventually masterminds Seraphina's downfall by using Fanta, Pain, and Syndra; Seraphina is punished for her attempt to get rid of Oreadia and reborn as a human on earth who would remember her heavenly origins <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> turned fifteen.|$|E

It was <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was halfway through Shikasta that she {{realised}} that she had [...] "created a marvelous format" [...] that she could use for other books, and it was this format, Canopus in Argos, that made The Marriages possible. Shikasta was originally intended to be a single self-contained book, but Lessing's fictional universe developed, and she ended up writing a series of five.|$|E

As the final chorus breaks into dance grooves, Madonna comes out of the theater and gives the boy a quick kiss on his lips. Both are clad in loose-fitting gray suits, which gives Madonna an androgynous look. They stroll away playfully in the sunrise, reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Jack Coogan in The Kid with the old boss pursuing them and shouting [...] "Come back, come back, we still need you" [...] in Italian. The tension between the visual and the musical dimensions of the video is extremely unsettling according to author Nicholas B.

500|$|Victoria {{had long}} wished {{to have an}} {{imperial}} title, reflecting Britain's expanding domain. [...] She was irked when Czar Alexander II held a higher rank than her as an emperor, and was appalled that her daughter, the Prussian Crown Princess, would outrank her when her husband came to the throne. She also saw an imperial title as proclaiming Britain's increased stature in the world. The title [...] "Empress of India" [...] had been used informally with respect to Victoria {{for some time and}} she wished to have that title formally bestowed on her. The Queen prevailed upon Disraeli to introduce a Royal Titles Bill, and also told of her intent to open Parliament in person, which during this time she did <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> wanted something from legislators. Disraeli was cautious in response, as careful soundings of MPs brought a negative reaction, and declined to place such a proposal in the Queen's Speech.|$|E
500|$|While {{filming the}} scenes {{where the family}} pushes the van to get it started, a stunt {{coordinator}} was used {{to ensure the safety}} of the actors. In an interview, actor Greg Kinnear jokingly described how the scenes were filmed when he was driving: [...] "I was going like 50 miles an hour in this '71 VW van that doesn't have side air bags. Basically you'd wait for this huge camera truck to come whizzing in front of us with the camera. 'Okay, go!' I mean, it was insanity; it's the most dangerous movie I've ever made." [...] While filming the scenes in the van, the actors would at times remain in the vehicle for three or four hours a day. For scenes in which Alan Arkin's character was swearing excessively, Breslin had her headphones on and could not hear the dialogue, just like her character in the film. <b>Only</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> saw the film did she know what was being said. On July 25, 2006 Fox Searchlight Pictures invited VW bus owners to a screening at Vineland Drive-In theater in Industry, California. Over 60 of the vans were present at the screening.|$|E

500|$|Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times was {{disappointed}} with almost everything, {{and said the}} episode [...] "felt more like a long, slow letdown after a season of gleeful highs". She added, [...] "New Directions' sectionals performance wasn't a total fumble, but it wasn't the touchdown you might've hoped for either", and of the long-awaited opportunity to see other members featured in competition: [...] "the anticipated shining moment {{turned out to be}} so dull." [...] Reiter was one of a very few critics to note the absence of cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester in the episode, and <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> lamented the [...] "relative lack of humor". Futterman merely remarked on Sue's non-appearance in passing; she {{came to the conclusion that}} [...] "we got a spazzy, unfocused hour at the expense of emotional investment", and though Anthony Benigno of the Daily News complimented the [...] "solid acting", he also wrote that [...] "this is the first time the show's started to feel genuinely boring as opposed to, you know, gleeful." [...] He made a general complaint as well: [...] "This show is starting to suffer in a big way from making the music secondary to the plot." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating. He said that the show [...] "tried to make it all work, and while the hour was enjoyable enough, each storyline felt just a little bit shy of going from good to great." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the British Regency {{lasted only}} from 1811 to 1820, Heyer's romances were set between 1752 and 1825. As noted by {{literary}} critic Kay Mussell, the books revolved around a [...] "structured social ritual — the marriage market {{represented by the}} London season" [...] where [...] "all {{are in danger of}} ostracism for inappropriate behavior". Her Regency romances were inspired by the writings of Jane Austen, whose novels were set in the same era. Austen's works, however, were contemporary novels, describing the times in which she lived. According to Pamela Regis in her work A Natural History of the Romance Novel, because Heyer's stories took place amidst events that had occurred over 100years earlier, she had to include more detail on the period in order for her readers to understand it. While Austen could ignore the [...] "minutiae of dress and decor", Heyer included those details [...] "to invest the novels... with 'the tone of the time'". Later reviewers, such as Lillian Robinson, criticized Heyer's [...] "passion for the specific fact without concern for its significance", and Marghanita Laski pointed out that [...] "these aspects on which Heyer is so dependent for her creation of atmosphere are just those which Jane Austen... referred to <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> wanted to show that a character was vulgar or ridiculous". Others, including A. S. Byatt, believe that Heyer's [...] "awareness of this atmosphere — both of the minute details of the social pursuits of her leisured classes and of the emotional structure behind the fiction it produced — is her greatest asset".|$|E

Ganger Jennifer becomes furious at this display and rages off; the other Gangers agree {{to work with the}} humans to escape the facility. They free the humans trapped in the acid storage room, and race off through the crypts below the monastery, chased by a savage Ganger Jennifer who has transformed herself into a monster. Both Ganger and human sacrifice themselves to stall the monster while letting {{the rest of the group}} escape. They eventually come onto a room where the TARDIS, having been trapped in a pool of acid outside, has fallen into the crypt. Ganger Cleaves offers to hold the door to allow the rest to escape, and the Doctor soon joins her, stunning Amy. To Amy's surprise, the Doctor reveals that he and his Ganger had switched shoes long ago; Amy's distrust of the Ganger was completely misplaced. Amy apologizes to the Ganger Doctor, who accepts but warns her to [...] "push, Amy, but <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> tells you to". As the surviving humans and Gangers escape to the TARDIS, the Cleaves and Doctor Gangers together face the monster, triggering a sonic screwdriver at the right moment to cause them and the monster to dissolve back into liquid.|$|E
