5|$|The {{decisions}} reached {{during this}} period vary, however, mostly due to the differing judicial philosophies of the time. While A.V. Dicey maintained that the prevalent philosophy was one of laissez faire thanks {{to the influence of}} philosophers and economists such as Adam Smith, Michael W. Flinn asserted that: Another common error... has been the assumption that the classical economists were the only effective influence on social and economic policy in the early and mid-nineteenth century. This is a curiously perverse view, since it ignores powerful voices like those of Bentham, Chadwick, the social novelists, many by no means inarticulate members of the medical profession, the humanitarians, the Christian Socialists and most sections of the many working class movements. There was in short, nothing approaching a consensus of opinion concerning laissez-faire and state intervention, even in the very narrow social sector represented by governments, Parliament, and the press. In practice the ears of ministers were assaulted by a confused babble <b>of</b> <b>voices</b> rather than bewitched by the soft whisper of a single plea for inaction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Voice {{disorders}} {{are a major}} problem among teachers. However, the reported prevalence of these disorders have a wide range, and the natural variation <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> disorders among teachers is unknown {{due to the lack}} of longitudinal studies. Moreover, there is not a consensus about the best approach for assessing voice disorders among teachers at work. Results on prevalence <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> disorders in this occupational group are based on different sources (questionnaires, perceptual assessment, clinical assessment, acoustical assessment), which make difficult the comparison of these results. On the other hand, associated factors <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> disorders among teachers include individual factors, such as sex and age; and work-related conditions, such as acoustic and noise conditions, topic of teaching and using loud voice. Yet, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the determinants <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> disorders among teachers. In addition, voice disorders have a big impact on quality of life and daily performance <b>of</b> teachers. Moreover, <b>voice</b> disorders may interfere with the productivity at work, and thus generate economic costs to the schools and the teachers due to the voice-related absenteeism, reduction in productivity at work, and use of health services. This thesis focuses on the occurrence, causes and consequences <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> disorders among teachers with four aims: 1. To assess the presence <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> disorders among teachers. 2. To evaluate the agreement between different methods <b>of</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> disorders among teachers. 3. To distinguish work-related determinants <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> disorders among teachers. 4. To identify the socio-economic consequences <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> disorders among teachers. The main results of this thesis were: 1. Teachers had a significantly increased occurrence <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> disorders compared with other occupations. 2. Self-report <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> complaints, perceptual assessment <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> and objective assessment <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> show large differences and may offer different information about voice quality and functioning. Therefore, it is recommended to include in the assessment <b>of</b> work-related <b>voice</b> disorders information concerning these three assessment methods. 3. Noise and acoustics might play a role in the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> symptoms among teachers. Therefore, it is advisable to include physical measurements of the working environment in studies that measure the impact of noise and acoustics on vocal health. 4. The increase on health care use, absenteeism, and productivity loss at work due to voice disorders among teachers represent an important burden of these disorders...|$|R
25|$|Lysaker & Lysaker {{explained}} that Bakhtin theorized {{of human beings}} as entities composed of a multiplicity <b>of</b> <b>voices</b> (self-as-father, self-as-son, self-as-student, self-as-teacher, self-as-sad, self-as-happy, self-as-pro-life) that are in constant flux within him as he dialogues with and relates to the world around him. These voices constantly arrange and re-arrange themselves in hierarchies that are not governed by an overarching ego. Each hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>voices</b> (roles and dispositions) constitutes a dialogical position. Lysaker & Lysaker use the term dialogical positions because they are exactly the positions (roles and dispositions) Dasein takes {{up in the world}} when interacting with and relating to others—-and are constituted by his polyphonic nature. The flux, or re-arrangement, occurs from situational contexts that tells Dasein which dialogical position, or set <b>of</b> <b>voices,</b> must come to the foreground. The flux is also based on increased understanding of the world around human beings and their respective roles in it. Hermeneuts {{say that this is a}} stark contrast to mainstream paradigms in psychotherapy. Instead of a single ego, or voice, that makes up a person's identity and stands above and against the world, a constantly-rearranging hierarchy of multiple voices dialogues with others and co-constitutes a person's identity, and that this is the reason that Taylor writes that we should abandon paradigms such as the self as a highly autonomous individual and re-conceptualize that self as a dialogical self that is always-already a relational being constantly engaged in multiple ongoing conversations.|$|E

25|$|Certon wrote eight masses that survive, motets, psalm settings, chansons spirituelles (chansons with {{religious}} texts, {{related to the}} Italian madrigali spirituali), and numerous secular chansons. His style is relatively typical of mid-century composers, except that he was unusually attentive to large-scale form, for example framing longer masses (such as his Requiem) with very simple movements, with the inner movements showing greater tension and complexity. In addition he was skilled at varying texture between homophonic and polyphonic passages, and often changing the number and register <b>of</b> <b>voices</b> singing at any time.|$|E
25|$|La Rue {{wrote one}} of the {{earliest}} polyphonic Requiem Masses to survive, and it is one of his most famous works.

This was the normal liturgical practice in gallican France and the region of northern Europe in which he worked. This mass, more than many others, emphasises the low registers <b>of</b> <b>voices,</b> and even the lowest voices themselves.|$|E
