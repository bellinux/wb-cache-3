40|$|In {{northern}} Italy {{the base}} of the Tesero Oolite Horizon represents the lithological boundary between the Bellerophon and Werfen Formations and marks {{one of the most dramatic}} environmental perturbations in Phanerozoic time. The marl, which directly underlies the Tesero Horizon, contains many indicators of environmental change during the end-Permian mass extinction. At Vigo Meano, near Trento, the marl is relatively thermally immature and contains abundant terrestrially-sourced <b>oxygen</b> containing <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> such as xanthones, dibenzofurans and dibenzo-p-dioxin as well as abundant alkylated naphthalenes...|$|R
30|$|The {{reactivity}} of <b>oxygen</b> towards O-heterocyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> {{is quite different}} for furan and it derivatives {{compared to that of}} benzofuran and its benzologs. Oxidation of furan readily ring opens the structure, whereas oxidation of benzofuran leads to addition products. The most common outcome is the formation of heavier products by oxygen-mediated addition reactions.|$|R
40|$|The white-rot fungus Phlebia radiata preferably degrades lignin {{and is thus}} a {{potential}} fungus for biopulping and other applications in the pulp and paper industry. To elucidate important factors involved in the degradation of lignin carbohydrate complex (LCC) by this fungus, the metabolism of [U-^ 14 C]-labelled wheat straw, [^ 14 C]-labelled cellulose and [^ 14 C]-labelled wheat straw hemicellulose was studied. The degradation of hemicellulose and lignin were apparently linked together and controlled by some common factors (e. g. oxygen, the effect of supplemented <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds)</b> whereas the degradation of cellulose usually occurred under different conditions. In most cases the amount of nutrient nitrogen did not influence the evolution of ^ 14 CO_ 2 from carbohydrates. Addition of {{a small amount of}} glucose (0. 05 %, 2. 8 mM) strongly decreased the degradation of cellulose but enhanced lignin degradation. Under oxygen atmosphere the degradation of hemicellulose was not influenced by added glucose (low nutrient nitrogen), which implied that low amounts of glucose could be used to specifically promote lignin degradation by P. radiata. The accelerating effect was most prominent under 100 % <b>oxygen</b> atmosphere. <b>Aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> strongly repressed the degradation of cellulose. In contrast, the degradation of hemicellulose was not influenced by <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> in air but under 100 % oxygen the fungus degraded 35. 70 % more hemicellulose (to ^ 14 CO_ 2) when <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> were present than without them. The degradation of lignin was either stimulated or repressed by <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds,</b> {{depending on the type of}} the compound used...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} {{chemical ionisation}} (APCI) of chlorinated benzene derivatives was studied {{to develop a}} mass spectrometry technique for qualitative and quantitative determination of their aerobic and anaerobic microbial degradation products. Using conventional reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) eluents, such as methanol, water or acetonitrile, non-polar <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> showed very low response factors both in electrospray (ES) and in APCI either in positive or negative ion mode. Use of dichloromethane solvent in positive ion APCI showed high sensitivity both for polar and for apolar <b>aromatics,</b> <b>Oxygen</b> containing <b>compounds</b> gave [M + H](+) ions while ionisation of aromatic hydrocarbons and their chlorinated derivatives {{was found to be}} a complex process, generating mainly [M + 13](+) ions.

In this experiment Pyrex glass reactor was use and sample was using total 75 gm. Waste tyre was 25 gm by weight and polypropylene was 50 gm by weight. 5 % Zinc Oxide catalyst was {{use in this}} experiment to accelerate the reaction. Product fuel density is 0. 75 gm/ml and fuel color is light yellow. Waste tyre and polypropylene waste plastic to fuel conversion percentage was 63. 47 %, light gas percentage was 12. 27 %, and solid black residue percentage was 24. 26 %. Product fuel was analysis by using Perkin Elmer GC/MS and GC/MS chromatogram showed carbon chain range C 3 to C 21.

40|$|The thermal {{effects of}} three (one major and two minor) Miocene diabase {{intrusions}} on Cretaceous black shales from DSDP site 41 - 368 have been analyzed. A concentration gradient was observed, {{especially for the}} hydrocarbons, decreasing towards the major intrusion and between the three sills. The thermally-altered samples in the proximity of and between the sills contained elemental sulfur and an excess of thermally-derived pristane over phytane. whereas, the unaltered sediments contained no elemental sulfur, and more phytane than pristane. A maximum yield of the extractable hydrocarbons was observed {{at a depth of}} 7 m below the major sill. Two classes of molecular markers were present in this bitumen suite. The first was sesqui-, di- and triterpenoids and steranes. which could be correlated with both terrigenous and autochthonous sources. They were geologically mature and showed no significant changes due to the thermal stress. The second class was found in the altered samples, which contained only polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons with low alkyl substitution and sulfur and <b>oxygen</b> heterocyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds.</b> These compounds were derived from pyrolytic reactions during the thermal event. Kerogen was isolated from all of these samples, but only traces of humic substances were present. The H/C, N/C, d 13 C, d 34 S and dD all exhibit the expected effects of thermal stress. The kerogen becomes more aromatized and richer in 13 C, 34 S and D in the proximity of and between the sills. Maturation trends were also measured by the vitrinite reflectance and electron spin resonance, where the thermal stress could be correlated with an elevated country rock temperature and an increased degree of aromaticity. The effects of in situ thermal stress on the organic-rich shales resulted in the generation and expulsion of petroliferous material from the vicinity of the sills...|$|R

40|$|<b>Aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> are an {{important}} component of the organic matter in some of the anaerobic environments that hyperthermophilic microorganisms inhabit, but the potential for hyperthermophilic microorganisms to metabolize <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> has not been described previously. In this study, aromatic metabolism was investigated in the hyperthermophile Ferroglobus placidus. F. placidus grew at 85 degrees C in anaerobic medium with a variety of <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> as the sole electron donor and poorly crystalline Fe(III) oxide as the electron acceptor. Growth coincided with Fe(III) reduction. <b>Aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> supporting growth included benzoate, phenol, 4 -hydroxybenzoate, benzaldehyde, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and t-cinnamic acid (3 -phenyl- 2 -propenoic acid). These <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> did not support growth when nitrate was provided as the electron acceptor, even though nitrate supports the growth of this organism with Fe(II) or H 2 as the electron donor. The stoichiometry of benzoate and phenol uptake and Fe(III) reduction indicated that F. placidus completely oxidized these <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> to carbon dioxide, with Fe(III) serving as the sole electron acceptor. This is the first example of an Archaea that can anaerobically oxidize an <b>aromatic</b> <b>compound.</b> These results also demonstrate for the first time that hyperthermophilic microorganisms can anaerobically oxidize <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> and suggest that hyperthermophiles may metabolize <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> in hot environments such as the deep hot subsurface and in marine and terrestrial hydrothermal zones in which Fe(III) is available as an electron acceptor...|$|R
40|$|The {{anaerobic}} metabolism of phthalate and other <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> by the denitrifying bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain P 136 was studied. Benzoate, cyclohex- 1 -ene-carboxylate, 2 -hydroxycyclohexanecarboxylate, and pimelate were detected as predominant metabolic intermediates during the metabolism of three isomers of phthalate, m-hydroxybenzoate, p-hydroxybenzoate, and cyclohex- 3 -ene-carboxylate. Inducible acyl-coenzyme A synthetase activities for phthalates, benzoate, cyclohex- 1 -ene-carboxylate, and cyclohex- 3 -ene-carboxylate were {{detected in the}} cells grown on <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Simultaneous adaptation to these <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> also occurred. A similar phenomenon was observed in the aerobic metabolism of <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> by this strain.

40|$|The {{short-term}} {{effect of}} several <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> (o-cresol, p-nitrophenol, o-chlorophenol and quinoline) was evaluated over granular anammox sludge cultivated over 2 {{years in a}} Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR). The anammox granular sludge had an average size of 1. 0 ± 0. 2 mmand was enriched in Brocadia sp. Specific Anammox Activity (SAA) batch tests with this granular biomass were {{carried out in the}} presence of o-cresol, p-nitrophenol, o-chlorophenol, quinoline and their mixtures. The anammox biomass was never exposed to the tested <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds,</b> prior to the SAA tests. The concentration and the mixture of <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> had a strong effect over the loss of the anammox activity. The higher the concentrations of the <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds,</b> the higher the reduction of the SAA. Quinoline and p-nitrophenol have a lower negative effect compared to o-cresol and o- chlorophenol. The Luong inhibition model seems to adjust better the inhibition of anammox biomass by the tested <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Depending on the <b>aromatic</b> <b>compound,</b> toxic or inhibitory effect was measured. o-Cresol and o-chlorophenol caused a toxic effect whereas p-nitrophenol and quinoline produced an inhibitory effect. In general, synergistic effects were observed when mixtures of <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> were studied...|$|R
40|$|A soil bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain P 136, was {{isolated}} by selective enrichment for anaerobic utilization of o-phthalate through nitrate respiration. o-Phthalate, m-phthalate, p-phthalate, benzoate, cyclohex- 1 -ene-carboxylate, and cyclohex- 3 -ene-carboxylate were utilized by this strain under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. m-Hydroxybenzoate and p-hydroxybenzoate were utilized only under anaerobic conditions. Protocatechuate and catechol were neither utilized nor detected as metabolic intermediates during the metabolism of these <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Cells grown anaerobically {{on one of}} these <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> also utilized all other <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> as substrates for denitrification without a lag period. On the other hand, cells grown on succinate utilized <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> after a lag period. Anaerobic growth on these substrates was dependent on the presence of nitrate and accompanied by the production of molecular nitrogen. The reduction of nitrite to nitrous oxide and the reduction of nitrous oxide to molecular nitrogen were also supported by anaerobic utilization of these <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> in this strain. Aerobically grown cells showed a lag period in denitrification with all substrates tested. Cells grown anaerobically on <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> also consumed <b>oxygen.</b> No lag period was observed for oxygen consumption during the transition period from anaerobic to aerobic conditions.
