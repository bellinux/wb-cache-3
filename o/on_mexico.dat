The remnants of Pauline triggered showers over the southwest United States and may have been responsible for a damaging tornado which occurred near Glendale, Arizona.|$|E

5|$|Electricians had power {{restored}} to the Freeport area by {{the day after the}} storm, and had power {{restored to}} most of the western portion of the island within three weeks after the hurricane. Work crews quickly removed road debris and tree limbs, and by the day after the passage of Wilma most roads were cleared. The passage of the hurricane left 1,000–4,000people and hundreds of animals homeless. In response, the Grand Bahama Humane Society distributed about 340kg (750lb) of dog food and treated or euthanized injured animals, depending on their condition. The earlier effects of Wilma <b>on</b> <b>Mexico</b> left many tourist areas in that country closed, leading to a 10% increase in tourism in the Bahamas in December 2005. By about three weeks after the hurricane, the airport on Grand Bahama Island was reopened, and all but one resort were also reopened; the remaining resort was reopened about two months after the hurricane.|$|E
