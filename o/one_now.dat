5|$|He was {{replaced}} by former player Billy Bonds. In Bonds' first full season, 1990–91, West Ham again secured promotion to Division <b>One.</b> <b>Now</b> back in the top flight, Bonds saw West Ham through {{one of their most}} controversial seasons. With the club planning to introduce a bond scheme, there was crowd unrest. West Ham finished last and were relegated back to Division Two after only one season. However, they rebounded strongly in 1992–93. With Trevor Morley and Clive Allen scoring 40 goals, they guaranteed themselves second place {{on the last day of}} the season with a 2–0 home win against Cambridge United, and with it promotion to the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003–04 season Sunderland {{finished}} third in Division One, and only a penalty shoot-out defeat {{at the hands of}} Crystal Palace prevented them from reaching the play-off final for a promotion place. In the 2004–05 season, Sunderland finished {{at the top of the}} table in Division <b>One,</b> <b>now</b> rechristened the Football League Championship, and thus returned to the Premier League. The 2005–06 season was poor for Sunderland, as they failed to win a home game before Christmas and were eventually relegated with a new record lowest points tally of 15, breaking their own previous record of 19. McCarthy was sacked in March and replaced by caretaker manager Kevin Ball. He took Sunderland to their first home win of the season, a 2–1 victory over Fulham.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders' {{franchise}} area {{consists of}} the regions controlled by the Buller, Canterbury, Mid-Canterbury, South Canterbury, Tasman and West Coast rugby unions. Before 2006, when the NPC was reorganised, Canterbury was the only union playing division <b>one</b> (<b>now</b> ITM Cup) within the Crusaders' catchment. As a result, the majority of Crusaders players were also listed with Canterbury. Today, the Crusaders' catchment contains two Mitre 10 Cup sides – Canterbury and Tasman.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} a root system was {{originally}} introduced by Wilhelm Killing around 1889 (in German, Wurzelsystem).

25|$|Watford {{is home to}} {{professional}} football team Watford F.C., who reached the 1984 FA Cup Final, also finishing as league Division <b>One</b> (<b>now</b> the Premier League) runners-up in 1983. They were relegated from Division One in 1988. In 1996, Watford was relegated from the new Division <b>One</b> (<b>now</b> the Football League Championship). Watford won the then Nationwide Division Two championship in 1998, then the following season (1998–99) reached the Premier League. The club was relegated the next season. After five years of uncertainty, Watford won the Football League Championship Play-Off Final achieving promotion to the Premier League in 2006, this time beating Leeds United A.F.C. by three goals to nil. The club was relegated to the Football League Championship after a single season (2006–2007) in the Premier League. They were promoted to the Premier League in 2015, after finishing 2nd in the Championship. Singer-songwriter Sir Elton John is a keen, long-term supporter of Watford F.C. and a former club chairman. He still maintains his links with Watford as Honorary Life President. Between 1997 and 2013 the club shared its ground, Vicarage Road, with Saracens Rugby Football Club.|$|E

He made his return on 31 March 1990 against Port Vale. By this time West Ham were 10th in the league and ultimately finished in 7th place missing out on the playoffs.|$|E

25|$|The {{city centre}} {{is laid out}} on a grid plan, {{a result of the}} westward {{expansion}} from the old medieval core during the Georgian era, initially into the area now called the Merchant City. Much of the initial grid can be credited to a surveyor named James Barry. The desire to create a regular layout of streets fits in well with the Enlightenment ideas about rationality: at the same time, similar developments were taking place in Edinburgh, with the creation of the New Town. Despite this, the layout is not very regular, due to the awkward topography, with numerous drumlins, as well as the generation of point de vues out of the existing Palladian mansions in the Merchant City, all but <b>one</b> <b>now</b> demolished.|$|E
25|$|Called {{in by the}} Imperial Continental Gas Association in 1863 {{to replace}} a failed roof over a {{telescoping}} gas holder, Schwedler devised a workable solution but thinking further about the problem, in 1866 published an article describing {{a new type of}} iron cupola that was simpler, lighter, and as sturdy: it takes the form of an unsupported spheroidal steel vault, rather than beams, and was normally used to span distances of 2545m. He used Schwedler cupolas in designing four new gas holders for Berlin's street lighting, of which the <b>one</b> <b>now</b> known as the Fichte-Bunker (1874) survives, and the only deterrent to their use today is the cost of labour.
