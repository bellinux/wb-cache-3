5|$|Across {{the entire}} {{width of the}} background, a darkening sky and <b>oncoming</b> storm clouds presage the {{destruction}} that the dancers are unwittingly about to bring upon themselves.|$|E
5|$|England and MCC captain Norman Yardley later {{admitted}} Barnes's close proximity {{throughout the season}} had a psychological effect on his batsmen, although the Australian did miss catches {{because he was too}} close to react to the <b>oncoming</b> ball.|$|E
5|$|A {{portion of}} subway-related deaths in New York {{consists}} of suicides committed by jumping {{in front of}} an <b>oncoming</b> train. Between 1990 and 2003, 343 subway-related suicides have been registered out of a citywide total of 7,394 (4.6%) and subway-related suicides increased by 30%, despite a decline in overall suicide numbers.|$|E
5|$|After the accident, the CNR {{installed}} block signals on {{the stretch}} of track on which the crash occurred. The railway later realigned the main line in that area, eliminating a sharp curve that prevented crews from seeing <b>oncoming</b> trains. Diefenbaker's successful defence of Atherton became an asset in his political rise. A number of monuments honour the dead.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} approached Texas, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings for potentially affected areas beginning on July18. Ships and ports were also continuously notified on the <b>oncoming</b> storm, which helped to keep offshore shipping accidents to a minimum. Inland, as a precautionary measure, rail operations {{along the coast}} were halted for a duration of the storm's passage.|$|E
5|$|Clips from Last Clear Chance are {{featured}} in 2004's Panorama Ephemera, a film created by Rick Prelinger which compiles clips from 64 short films {{in order to}} form a cohesive narrative. The clip used from Last Clear Chance is the scene where Frank Jr. and Betty drive {{into the path of}} an <b>oncoming</b> train. Panorama Ephemera can be downloaded or streamed for free at the Internet Archive.|$|E
5|$|In Fairfield, Idaho, two janitors witness an {{invisible}} force storm down a city street; a road worker is later {{killed by the}} force on the highway. The next day, an elephant suddenly materializes {{in front of an}} <b>oncoming</b> big rig. The driver manages to stop in time, but the elephant soon collapses and dies, over forty miles away from where it disappeared the night before at the Fairfield Zoo.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the storm, 150vehicles evacuated out of Freeport, while water craft were taken up the Brazos River as far inland as possible. 100families in Caplen and Gilchrist were also evacuated. The 38th division of the Texas National Guard, stationed in Palacios, was alerted due to the <b>oncoming</b> storm.|$|E
5|$|Morgan sets {{sail for}} Florida, hoping {{to beat the}} Spanish there, but his fleet is damaged by an <b>oncoming</b> {{hurricane}} and he is forced to dock in Cuba, where he leaves his ship in Havana. There he earns the respect of Lizzie the Pirate and strikes a deal, promising Lizzie the gold from the Spanish treasure fleet if she takes him to Florida.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{arrived in}} Paris on 20 March and governed {{for a period}} now called the Hundred Days. By the start of June the armed forces {{available}} to him had reached 200,000, {{and he decided to}} go on the offensive to attempt to drive a wedge between the <b>oncoming</b> British and Prussian armies. The French Army of the North crossed the frontier into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, in modern-day Belgium.|$|E
5|$|National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) {{investigations}} {{determined that}} evasive maneuvers undertaken by Flight 663 {{to avoid an}} <b>oncoming</b> Pan Am Boeing 707 caused the pilot to suffer spatial disorientation and lose control of the aircraft. The accident is the third-worst accident involving a DC-7.|$|E
5|$|The Vandals {{were also}} {{weakened}} by the hostility of their Roman subjects, the continued existence among the Vandals of a faction loyal to Hilderic, and by the ambivalent position of the Moorish tribes, who watched the <b>oncoming</b> conflict from the sidelines, ready to join the victor and seize the spoils.|$|E
5|$|With {{discipline}} breaking down, Spartacus {{turned his}} forces around and brought his entire strength {{to bear on}} the <b>oncoming</b> legions. In this last stand, the Battle of the Siler River, Spartacus' forces were finally routed completely, with {{the vast majority of them}} being killed on the battlefield. All the ancient historians stated that Spartacus was also killed on the battlefield. However, his body was never found.|$|E
5|$|A weather {{phenomenon}} known as the f√∂hn (with an identical effect to the chinook wind) can occur at all {{times of the year}} and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing air of very low relative humidity {{to the north of the}} Alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the Alps. This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for <b>oncoming</b> wind from the south. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the season, Underwood is trying to erase all links to Russo's death. Thus, he kills Barnes by shoving her in front of an <b>oncoming</b> Washington Metro train, and frames her colleague and lover Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian Arcelus) for cyberterrorism. Another early task for newly promoted Underwood is finding his own replacement as House Majority Whip. He supports Jacqueline Sharp (Molly Parker), a military veteran and third-term Representative from California, although he refrains from offering public backing.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the <b>oncoming</b> trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Colonel William E. Peters {{was able}} to get his 21st Virginia Cavalry Regiment ready for the <b>oncoming</b> Union cavalry, but was driven back across the river. Earlier, Peters had refused to burn Chambersburg and General McCausland had him arrested. However, the arrest was revoked a short time later, and Peters led the rear guard when they left the burning town. He {{performed}} relatively well at Moorefield, leading portions of his regiment while they slowed the Federal advance {{on the south side of}} the river.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle {{was located}} {{on one of}} the main frontiers of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. From 1434 until its {{annexation}} by the Russian Empire in 1793, the castle {{played a major role in}} the defense against the <b>oncoming</b> Cossack, Ottoman and Tatar invasions; from the 15th through 17th centuries, the castle was attacked by Tatar hordes a total of 51 times. The Tatar invasions of 1448, 1451, 1509 and 1528, as well as the Ottoman siege of 1533, caused damage to both the castle and the city but all of these invasions were successfully repelled.|$|E
5|$|His father William H. McCudden took a {{post at the}} Air Ministry at {{the rank}} of warrant officer after the Great War, but would die tragically at Clapham Junction railway station on 7 July 1920. When he stood up to offer a woman his seat the {{compartment}} door flew open, knocking him {{into the path of}} an <b>oncoming</b> train. Maurice Vincent became a pilot and served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) until he retired through illness in 1933. He died of colitis the following year, leaving a widow and small daughter.|$|E
5|$|In a later scene, Marcus {{encounters}} Sal. Marcus {{wants to}} apologize for his misbehavior, and chases Sal when he flees. Sal runs onto a street right ahead of an <b>oncoming</b> truck. Before the truck can hit Sal, the laughing man kicks Sal out of the way, sacrificing his own life for Sal's. Miranda finds the fourth note in Richard's shoe and learns that the laughing man came from the future to save Sal's life. The note asks Miranda to prepare a chronicle of recent events and deliver it by hand, {{but she does not}} know who to give it to.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March 2016, 2 SMRT {{maintenance}} trainees {{were run}} over {{and killed by}} an <b>oncoming</b> C151 train (trainset 073/074) reportedly travelling at 60km/h, 150 metres from Pasir Ris MRT Station, at approximately 11.10 am. The maintenance staff were a group of 15 personnel tasked to investigate a possible signalling system fault on the tracks near the Pasir Ris MRT Station. This incident had led to a 2.5 hour train service disruption and at least 10,000 commuters were affected.|$|E
5|$|Research on {{the drug}} given to the trial {{participants}} reveals {{it to be a}} chiral chemical, with two enantiomer forms; one is the harmless and beneficial Proloft, the other is the dangerous hallucinogen which Black and the others ingested. Dr Miller tells Black that he had been working on drugs to cure his own visions, which he believes are similar to Black's. One night, years earlier, Miller's left him after he ran into the road amidst <b>oncoming</b> traffic, almost killing himself in a hallucinatory state. After Black leaves, Hans Ingram (Gregory Itzin), the doctor responsible for the trial, breaks into Miller's room.|$|E
5|$|Ryse: Son of Rome {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} version of Rome. The game's tutorial section depicts Marius (voiced by John Hopkins) leading the defense of Rome against <b>oncoming</b> Celtic barbarians led by Boudica (Rachel McDowall). Marius hands a small, nondescript sack to a subordinate with the instructions to display it from an elevated position, then helps secure the Roman emperor, Nero (Sebastian Abineri), in a private safe room. At the emperor's behest he begins to tell his story; {{the rest of the}} game is an extended flashback depicting Marius' story up to this point.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 16:56:54 BRT at FL370, {{and it was}} confirmed that neither Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) system had activated or alerted its respective crew, nor did any crew see the <b>oncoming</b> traffic visually or initiate any evasive action prior to the collision. While both planes were equipped with TCAS, it was later determined that the Embraer's transponder had ceased operating almost an hour earlier, at 16:02, rendering both planes unable to automatically detect each other.|$|E
5|$|Townshend {{took charge}} of the British forces and {{realised}} that Bougainville's column was approaching from the British rear, having taken some time to arrive from Cap Rouge. He quickly formed up two battalions from the confused troops on the field and turned them to meet the <b>oncoming</b> French, a day-saving manoeuvre; instead of attacking with a well rested and ready force, Bougainville retreated while the rest of Montcalm's army slipped back across the St. Charles.|$|E
5|$|Writer/artist Alison Bechdel's book Fun Home, {{a memoir}} in comics format, was {{published}} in 2006 to critical acclaim. Its subject is Alison Bechdel's coming of age, with particular emphasis on her relationship to her father, Bruce Bechdel. Alison's coming out as a lesbian {{is complicated by the}} revelation that Bruce was a closeted homosexual whose extra-marital affairs included underage men. Four months after Alison comes out to her parents, Bruce is killed by an <b>oncoming</b> truck; although the evidence is equivocal, Alison concludes that he committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|After reports {{confirmed}} {{the existence of}} a hurricane in the eastern Atlantic, the Weather Bureau warned shipping lanes in the storm's path. Small craft warnings were issued for offshore areas from Block Island, Rhode Island south to Savannah, Georgia on September7 due to the threat of rough seas. After Carrie stalled on September11, the Weather Bureau gave Florida a slight chance of being affected by the storm, but the possibilities of the storm affecting the peninsula decreased after the hurricane curved northwards. After the storm was forecast to potentially impact Bermuda, schools were closed in preparation for Carrie, while vessels were warned of the <b>oncoming</b> hurricane. Most planes in Kindley Air Force Base on the island were evacuated, with the remaining planes weighted down by sandbags. After passing Bermuda, the storm was forecast to strike Nova Scotia, but instead Carrie curved towards the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Alan begins {{driving the}} car down the road, and sees Frank Jr. and Betty in front of him. They look behind to wave to Alan, and he waves back. However, the pair keep driving while looking backwards. Observing that a {{railroad}} with an <b>oncoming</b> train is near, Alan desperately tries to signal to them to stop waving and look ahead. When they do not pay attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields his eyes as the two drive right {{into the path of}} the train and are killed. Back in the present, at the funeral, Hal enters his police car, and decides to go back on the road in order to prevent more traffic accidents from occurring.|$|E
5|$|Around 7,000people in Cuba were {{evacuated}} {{to avoid the}} <b>oncoming</b> hurricane. Several shelters were opened by the Montserrat Red Cross on Montserrat, but few people sought refuge in them. Over 40shelters were ready for use in Nassau, Bahamas, even though Debby never affected the island. A total of 889people in the northern coastal plains {{were evacuated}} and placed in shelters out of Debby path. Three shelters were opened for the coming of Debby in Saint Thomas, and another two in Saint John. The total {{number of people in}} all five shelters only reached64. An additional 17people took refuge in an unknown number of shelters on St. Croix.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{depression}} turned northeast into a warm sector ahead of an <b>oncoming</b> cold front, and strengthened into a subtropical storm. The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) as it approached the Azores that evening. After tracking through the Azores, the storm weakened slightly {{as it moved}} to the north-northeast. Through an interaction with the cold front early on October5 the subtropical storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day. The newly absorbed system would separate from the dissolving frontal system and become Subtropical Storm Vince on October8.|$|E
5|$|As the Japanese ships {{continued}} to pound the Tsesarevich, the battleship , followed shortly afterward by Peresvet, boldly charged T≈çg≈ç's battleline {{in an attempt}} to divert the Japanese shellfire. The Japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to the <b>oncoming</b> ships, badly damaging both and forcing them to turn away. Ukhtomsky signaled the other Russian ships to follow him back to Port Arthur, but the signal was hard to discern because the flags had to be hung from the bridge railings without the topmasts and were only gradually recognized. Peresvet received a total of 39 hits of all sizes that killed 13 men and wounded 69. Her forward 12-inch turret was knocked out and several hits near the waterline caused flooding; compartments of the double bottom had to be counterflooded to restore some of her stability. Repairs took until late September.|$|E
5|$|At {{the edge}} of town, the 55th Regiment {{received}} orders from Mawhood to fall back and join the 40th Regiment in town. The 40th had taken up a position just outside town, {{on the north side}} of a ravine. The 55th formed up to the left of the 40th. The 55th sent a platoon to flank the <b>oncoming</b> Americans, but it was cut to pieces. When Sullivan sent several regiments to scale the ravine, they fell back to a breastwork. After making a brief stand, the British fell back again, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Alexander Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them blast away at the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, broke it down, and the British put a white flag outside one of the windows. Exactly 194 British soldiers walked out of the building and laid down their arms.|$|E
5|$|Dominant bulls follow {{groups of}} cows during the rut, from August into early winter. A bull will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from {{competing}} bulls and predators. Only mature bulls have large harems and breeding success peaks at {{about eight years}} of age. Bulls between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems, and {{spend most of the}} rut on the periphery of larger harems. Young and old bulls that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime. A bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight. Bulls that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive the rigors of the <b>oncoming</b> winter.|$|E
5|$|During the 1999 Marlboro 500 CART race, Canadian driver Greg Moore {{died in a}} crash {{along the}} backstretch of the track. It was {{determined}} that after sliding along the infield grass, Moore's car hit the edge of <b>oncoming</b> pavement, which caused the car to flip into a concrete retaining wall. The incident prompted the track owners, ISC, to pave the backstretch of both Auto Club Speedway and its sister track Michigan International Speedway {{in an attempt to}} prevent a similar accident. Shortly after the crash, CART mandated the use of a head-and-neck restraint system on all ovals. The rule eventually became mandatory on all tracks.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the book, the memoir exhibits Bruce Bechdel's obsession with restoring the family's Victorian home. His obsessive need to restore the house is connected to his emotional distance from his family, which he expressed in coldness and occasional bouts of abusive rage. This emotional distance, in turn, is connected with his being a closeted homosexual. Bruce Bechdel had homosexual relationships in the military and with his high school students; some of those students were also family friends and babysitters. At the age of 44, two weeks after his wife requested a divorce, he stepped into the path of an <b>oncoming</b> Sunbeam Bread truck and was killed. Although the evidence is equivocal, Alison Bechdel concludes that her father committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the <b>oncoming</b> lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E
