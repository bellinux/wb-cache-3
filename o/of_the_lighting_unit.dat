40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> microhardness <b>of</b> resin-based materials polymerized with a LED (light-emitting diode) light-curing unit (LCU) and a halogen LCU. Twenty cylindrical specimens (3. 0 mm in diameter and 2. 0 mm high) were prepared for each tested material (Z 100, Definite and Dyract). Specimens were light-cured with two LCUs (Ultraled and Curing Light 2500) for either 40 or 60 s on their top surfaces. Hardness was measured on top and bottom surfaces of each specimen. Statistical analysis was done by ANOVA and Tukey's test (p< 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference in}} hardness between LED LCU and halogen LCU for Z 100 and Dyract on top surface. Conversely, lower hardness was recorded when Definite was light-cured with the LED LCU than with the halogen lamp. On bottom surface, hardness was significantly lower for all materials light-cured with LED LCU. Z 100 was harder than Dyract and Definite regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> curing <b>unit.</b> There was no significant difference in hardness between the exposure times on top surface. Higher hardness was obtained when the materials were light-cured for 60 s on bottom surface. The tested LED was not able to produce <b>the</b> same microhardness <b>of</b> resin-based materials as the halogen LCU...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> curing <b>unit,</b> exposure time and absence <b>of</b> light-curing in <b>the</b> microhardness <b>of</b> two resin cements of dual polymerization. Materials and MethodsDisc-shaped samples were prepared for each resin cement. The samples were light-cured with Visilux 2500 or with Elipar FreeLight 2 for 20 or 40 seconds. In addition, samples that had not been light cured were prepared for each cement studied. Measurements of Knoop microhardness were made after 15 minutes and 24 hours. <b>The</b> average value <b>of</b> Knoop microhardness was determined to each group and the results were submitted to analysis of variance ANOVA and Tukey test (α= 0. 05). ResultsDifferences have been detected between light-cured and non light-cured samples, with these showing significantly lower results. Samples with 20 seconds exposure time and measurements undertaken 15 minutes post-exposure showed statistically significant lower values, compared to samples with 40 seconds exposure time and measurements made 24 hours post-exposure time. No statistically significant difference was found between the results obtained with the two light-curing units. ConclusionsLight-curing with second generation LED systems did not show higher results, comparatively to conventional Halogen <b>light</b> <b>units.</b> For both cements, microhardness was significantly higher when light-curing was undertaken and there was a significant increase in microhardness after light exposure. Dental practitioners should consider that a LED whit high intensity doesn’t mean a short polymerization time nor a better polymerization in regard to a conventional halogen...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} [self. ], an {{open source}} art installation that embodies artificial intelligence (AI) {{in order to}} learn, react, and respond to stimuli from its immediate environment. Biologically inspired models are implemented to achieve this behavior, and Csound is used for most parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> audio processing involved in the system. The artificial intelligence is physically represented by a robot head, built on a modified moving head for stage <b>lighting.</b> Everything but <b>the</b> motors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage <b>lighting</b> <b>unit</b> was removed and a projector, camera and microphones added. No form of knowledge or grammar have been implemented in the AI, the system starts in a ``tabula rasa state and learns everything via its own sensory channels, forming categories in a bottom-up fashion. The robot recognizes sounds and faces, {{and is able to}} recognize similar sounds, link them with the corresponding faces, and use <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> past experiences to form new sentences. Since <b>the</b> utterances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AI is solely based on audio and video items it has learned from the interaction with people, an insight into the learning process (i. e. what it has learned from who) can be glimpsed.

40|$|Background and Aim: Light cured {{composites}} {{and other}} restorative materials are quite common in dentistry today. Successful restorations {{are dependent on}} efficiency <b>of</b> curing <b>light</b> <b>unit,</b> eg. <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> emitted <b>light</b> and its wave length. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} evaluate <b>the</b> efficiency units <b>of</b> curing, in private dental offices in Tehran. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive cross sectional study, light curing devices in 240 private dental offices were evaluated randomly. Light intensity was measured by radiometer, debris on the fan and cracks and scratches on the filter were directly observed and <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> device, frequency <b>of</b> changing <b>the</b> bulb and satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dentist with regard to <b>the</b> <b>light</b> curing <b>unit</b> were recorded in a questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Spearman and t test, with p&lt; 0. 05 as <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> significance. Results: <b>The</b> results showed that 53. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> units had intensities more than 300 mW/cm 2. <b>The</b> intensity <b>of</b> 30. 4 % of curing <b>light</b> <b>units</b> were between 20 and 300 mW/cm 2 and 15. 8 % had intensities lower than "n 200 mW/cm 2. There was a negative relation between <b>light</b> intensity and <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unit, frequency <b>of</b> bulb changing or scratches on the filter and debris on the fan. Conclusion: <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this study showed that <b>the</b> <b>light</b> intensities <b>of</b> about 46 % of <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> used in private dental practices and clinics were inadequate. Since factors like aging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curing <b>light</b> <b>unit,</b> frequent bulb changing, increasing <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> debris on <b>the</b> fan and scratches on the filter reduce <b>the</b> <b>light</b> intensity, regular quality control of these devices is essential...|$|R
