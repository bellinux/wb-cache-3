This can be reduced to the non-magnetic Schrödinger operator through a gauge transformation. The main contribution of this paper lies <b>in</b> generalizing this <b>operator</b> <b>in</b> three different ways: to also include matrix-valued potential functions as in Eq. (1.5), to the more general <b>operator</b> <b>in</b> Eq. (1.4), and lastly to settings where the operator acts on functions defined on subsets of the real line.

A troop comprises four patrols with five or six <b>operators</b> <b>in</b> each patrol, and is commanded by a captain with each patrol commanded by a sergeant. For surveillance operations the SASR usually operates in patrols; however, for CT operations it usually employs larger force elements. Support personnel include signallers, mechanics and technicians, medical staff, storemen, drivers, caterers and various specialists. It was reported in 2012 that six female soldiers were being trained in the United States. As of 2003, 152 Signal Squadron comprised four troops.
