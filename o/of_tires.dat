Food remained unrationed during the war, with only the sales <b>of</b> <b>tires</b> and automobiles restricted by the government. One {{of the consequences of}} the Congo's economic mobilisation during the war, particularly for the black population, was significant urbanisation.

5|$|Electric vehicle {{warning sounds}} are {{a series of}} sounds {{designed}} to alert pedestrians to the presence of electric drive vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) travelling at low speeds. Warning sound devices were deemed necessary by some government regulators because vehicles operating in all-electric mode produce less noise than traditional combustion engine vehicles and can {{make it more difficult for}} pedestrians, the blind, cyclists, and others, to be aware of their presence. Warning sounds may be driver triggered (as in a horn but less urgent) or automatic at low speeds; in type, they vary from clearly artificial (beeps, chimes) to those that mimic engine sounds and those <b>of</b> <b>tires</b> moving over gravel.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s, the American Budd Company, at {{the time}} a {{relatively}} obscure auto-frame supplier, developed an extensive working relationship with the French firm Michelin, which was best known for its tires.

The company claimed that its application <b>of</b> <b>tires</b> on its rail cars afforded both a substantially more cushioned ride and increased the cars' traction by 35%. The design of Michelin's tired wheels included an aluminum safety ring and a flange that were only used {{in the event of a}} puncture or other type of tire failure; during normal operation, only the rubber tire made contact with the rail.|$|E

5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands <b>of</b> <b>tires</b> have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E

40|$|Use <b>of</b> <b>tire</b> shred–soil {{mixtures}} as backfill {{materials in}} mechanically stabilized earth walls has several advantages over other backfill materials: (1) good drainage, (2) high shear strength, and (3) low compacted unit weight. This paper {{presents the results}} of laboratory pullout tests performed on uniaxial geogrid embedded in tire shred–sand mixtures. The effects <b>of</b> <b>tire</b> shred size, tire shred–sand mixing ratio and confining pressure on the interaction between the geogrid and tire shred–sand mixtures are evaluated. Three sizes <b>of</b> <b>tire</b> shreds are considered: tire chips (with 9. 5 mm nominal size), tire shreds 50 -to- 100 mm long and tire shreds 100 -to- 200 mm in length, with mixing ratios of 0, 12, 25 and 100 % <b>of</b> <b>tire</b> shreds in the mixtures (by weight). Based on compaction testing of a number of mixtures, the optimal mixing proportion <b>of</b> <b>tire</b> shreds and sand was found to lie between 25 / 75 and 30 / 70 (by weight <b>of</b> <b>tire</b> shred and sand); this is equivalent to approximately 40 / 60 and 50 / 50, respectively, by volume <b>of</b> <b>tire</b> shreds and sand. The pullout resistance of a geogrid embedded in tire shred–sand mixtures is significantly higher than that of the same geogrid embedded in tire shreds only. The size <b>of</b> the <b>tire</b> shreds has negligible effect on the pullout resistance of a geogrid embedded in mixtures prepared with either low (12 / 88 mix) or high (100 / 0 mix) tire shred content.
