40|$|High-yielding {{variety is}} one of the targets in soybean {{breeding}} program. High-yielding variety could be developed through simultaneous selection. Simultaneous selection using selection index was more efficient than selection based on an individual trait only.

40|$|The issue {{addressed}} {{in this study is}} whether there are differential effects <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> letters on word and nonword naming latency. Experiment 1 examined the effect <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> letters on latency for naming high-frequency words, low-frequency words, and nonwords. <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> letters affected latency for low-frequency words and nonwords but did not affect latency for high-frequency words. <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> letters was also negatively correlated with <b>number</b> <b>of</b> orthographic neighbours, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> friends, and average grapheme frequency. <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> letters continued to affect nonword naming latency, but not low-frequency word naming latency, after the effects of orthographic neighbourhood size, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> friends, and average grapheme frequency had been accounted for. Experiment 2 found that <b>number</b> <b>of</b> letters had no effect on the latency of delayed naming of the same words and nonwords. It is concluded that the effect <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> letters on nonword naming reflects a sequential, non-lexical reading mechanism. © 1997 The Experimental Psychology Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
