25|$|Fresh air {{for both}} the crew and engine was drawn into the tank via an 18m long rubber hose to which a float was {{attached}} to keep one end above the waterâ€™s surface. A radio antenna was also attached to the float to provide communication between the tank crew and the transport barge. The tank's engine was converted to be cooled with seawater, and the exhaust pipes were fitted with <b>overpressure</b> <b>valves.</b> Any water seeping into the tank's hull could be expelled by an internal bilge pump. Navigation underwater was accomplished using a directional gyrocompass or by following instructions radioed from the transport barge.|$|R
25|$|If a {{shut-off}} valve is fitted {{between the first}} and second stages, as is found on scuba bailout systems used for commercial diving and in some technical diving configurations, the demand valve will normally be isolated and unable to function as a relief valve.

25|$|The bailout {{block is}} a small {{manifold}} fitted either to the harness where {{it is in a}} convenient but protected position, commonly on the right side on the waist strap, or on the helmet, also usually {{on the right side of}} the temple, with the valve knob to the side to distinguish it from the free-flow or defogging valve which is commonly to the front. The bailout block has a connection for the main gas supply from the umbilical through a non-return valve. This route can not be closed and supplies the helmet demand valve and free flow valve under normal circumstances. The bailout gas from the back mounted cylinder passes through a conventional scuba first stage at the cylinder valve, to the bailout block, where it is normally isolated by the bailout valve. When the diver needs to switch over to bailout gas he simply opens the bailout valve and the gas is supplied to the helmet or mask. As the valve is normally closed, a leak in the first stage regulator seat will cause the interstage pressure to rise, and unless an <b>overpressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> is fitted to the first stage the hose may burst. Aftermarket <b>overpressure</b> <b>valves</b> are available which can be fitted into a standard low-pressure port of most first stages.|$|R
25|$|A Stirling engine uses a {{single-phase}} {{working fluid}} that maintains an internal pressure {{close to the}} design pressure, and thus for a properly designed system the risk of explosion is low. In comparison, a steam engine uses a two-phase gas/liquid working fluid, so a faulty <b>overpressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> can cause an explosion.|$|R
50|$|Most {{pressurized}} lubrication systems incorporate an <b>overpressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> {{to allow}} oil {{to bypass the}} filter if its flow restriction is excessive, to protect the engine from oil starvation. Filter bypass may occur if the filter is clogged or the oil is thickened by cold weather. The <b>overpressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> is frequently incorporated into the oil filter. Filters mounted such that oil tends to drain from them usually incorporate an anti-drainback valve to hold oil in the filter after the engine (or other lubrication system) is shut down. This is done to avoid a delay in oil pressure buildup once the system is restarted; without an anti-drainback valve, pressurized oil would have to fill the filter before travelling onward to the engine's working parts. This situation can cause premature wear of moving parts due to initial lack of oil.|$|R
50|$|During ascent the {{gas in the}} {{breathing}} circuit will expand, and must have some way of escape before the pressure difference causes injury to the diver or damage to the loop. The simplest {{way to do this}} is for the diver to allow excess gas to escape around the mouthpiece or through the nose, but a simple <b>overpressure</b> <b>valve</b> is reliable and can be adjusted to control the permitted overpressure. The <b>overpressure</b> <b>valve</b> is typically mounted on the counterlung and in military diving rebreathers it may be fitted with a diffuser.|$|E
50|$|A low {{pressure}} diving air compressor usually has a delivery pressure {{of up to}} 30 bar, which is regulated to suit {{the depth of the}} dive.A high pressure diving compressor has a delivery pressure which is usually over 150 bar, and is commonly between 200 and 300 bar.

5000|$|The BWR is {{specifically}} designed to respond to pressure transients, having a [...] "pressure suppression" [...] type of design which vents <b>overpressure</b> using safety-relief <b>valves</b> to {{below the surface of}} a pool of liquid water within the containment, known as the [...] "wetwell", [...] "torus" [...] or [...] "suppression pool". All BWRs utilize a number of safety/relief <b>valves</b> for <b>overpressure,</b> up to 7 of these {{are a part of the}} Automatic Depressurization System (ADS) and 18 safety <b>overpressure</b> relief <b>valves</b> on ABWR models, only a few of which have to function to stop the pressure rise of a transient.

2500|$|Development of space-suits in the 1960s {{led to the}} pressure-tight zipper, first {{manufactured}} by B.F. Goodrich, and first used on a dry suit by Bev Morgan in 1956. The suit was in expanded neoprene and had an oral inflator and latex seals. This {{was followed by the}} Unisuit, by Poseidon Industri AB of Sweden, also in neoprene, and which included a low pressure inflator valve and exhaust valves. The zipper ran from mid-back to mid-chest via the crotch. This design became the industry standard for a while and use was widespread. <b>Overpressure</b> <b>valves</b> were installed in the ankles, wrists and neck of dry suits to remove excessive air introduced [...] through the face mask to prevent discomfort created by squeeze, which also increased the insulation capacity of the undergarments. These were called constant volume dry suits. Also in Sweden, Stig InsulÃ¡n and Jorn Stubdal developed a vulcanised rubber drysuit, and InsulÃ¡n patented the semi-automatic variable volume drysuit exhaust valve in 1971 which combined with the low pressure inflator valve gave the diver precise and trouble-free buoyancy control, in the variable volume dry suit.|$|R

50|$|The fresh gas {{addition}} is made {{by controlling}} the pressure in a dosage chamber proportional to the counterlung bellows volume. The dosage chamber is filled with fresh gas to a pressure proportional to bellows volume, with the highest pressure when the bellows is in the empty position. When the bellows fills during exhalation, the gas is released from the dosage chamber into the breathing circuit, proportional to the volume in the bellows during exhalation, and is fully released when the bellows is full. Excess gas is dumped to the environment through the <b>overpressure</b> <b>valve</b> after the bellows is full.|$|E

25|$|The two first stages {{are mounted}} on {{independently}} closable valves, {{as a first}} stage freeze free-flow can only be stopped by shutting off the air supply from the cylinder until the valve has thawed out. The second regulator is there to supply the remaining gas when the first regulator is shut off. A second-stage isolation valve {{used in conjunction with}} a first-stage <b>overpressure</b> relief <b>valve</b> may be effective as a quick method to manage demand valve free-flow.|$|R
40|$|Forwarding {{decisions}} in classical IP-based networks are predetermined by routing. This {{is necessary to}} avoid loops, inhibiting opportunities to implement an adaptive and intelligent forwarding plane. Consequently, content distribution efficiency is reduced {{due to a lack}} of inherent multi-path transmission. In Named Data Networking (NDN) instead, routing shall hold a supporting role to forwarding, providing sufficient potential to enhance content dissemination at the forwarding plane. In this paper we design, implement, and evaluate a novel probability-based forwarding strategy, called Stochastic Adaptive Forwarding (SAF) for NDN. SAF imitates a self-adjusting water pipe system, intelligently guiding and distributing Interests through network crossings circumventing link failures and bottlenecks. Just as real pipe systems, SAF employs <b>overpressure</b> <b>valves</b> enabling congested nodes to lower pressure autonomously. Through an implicit feedback mechanism it is ensured that the fraction of the traffic forwarded via congested nodes decreases. By conducting simulations we show that our approach outperforms existing forwarding strategies in terms of the Interest satisfaction ratio in the majority of the evaluated scenarios. This is achieved by extensive utilization of NDN's multipath and content-lookup capabilities without relying on the routing plane. SAF explores the local environment by redirecting requests that are likely to be dropped anyway. This enables SAF to identify new paths to the content origin or to cached replicas, circumventing link failures and resource shortages without relying on routing updates.

Expansion and contraction of balloon accommodates expansion or contraction of gas during operational heating or cooling in working volume, maintaining pressure in working volume at ambient or constant differential above or below ambient. Gas lost from system due to leakage or diffusion, low-pressure sensor responds, signaling valve actuators to supply more gas to working volume.

5000|$|Inflator valve {{malfunction}} can {{inflate the}} bladder when the buoyancy is not needed, {{and if not}} recognized and dealt with promptly, can result in uncontrolled ascent with associated risk of decompression illness. This can happen more quickly with inflators combined with alternative demand valves as they must use a larger bore hose connector. However, the standard <b>overpressure</b> and dump <b>valves</b> provided are able to vent air faster than the inflator valve can fill the bladder. This can be mitigated by the ability to disconnect the inflator hose under pressure, a skill which is trained by some agencies.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to digital pumps and motors with electronic controlled valves for each working chamber in positive displacement machines. The approach is focused on low speed operation of hydraulic pumps and motors. When applied to High Torque Low Speed radial piston units with eccentric shaft it offers increased efficiency, increased power capacity, more compact design, displacement control {{and a number of}} other control features. The proposed valve system has out-wards opening poppet-type valves on both the high- and low pressure side. This solution allows for a symmetric valve arrangement, enabling the units to operate as traditional motors/pumps with traditional distributor valves as well as to be used in simplified system layouts where full advantage is taken of the technology. This is opposed to current solutions having poppet type valves opening inwards on the low-pressure side and outwards on the high-pressure side, requiring dedicated high-and low pressure ports, also on motors. New opportunities and challenges are discussed, among which are four quadrant operation, displacement variation, start and stop, <b>valve</b> timing, <b>overpressure</b> protection and <b>valve</b> actuators...|$|R
50|$|Nitrogen is {{generally}} preferred over carbon dioxide {{for a few}} reasons. Nitrogen will not liquefy and leak into the marker, while if the CO2 tank doesn't have an anti-siphon tube installed, or {{if there is no}} expansion chamber or regulator, liquid CO2 can leak into the marker, causing damage to O-rings and dangerous <b>overpressures.</b> The solenoid <b>valves</b> on electro-pneumatic markers are particularly sensitive to this, and thus many manufacturers will specify to use only nitrogen or HPA with their electro-pneumatic markers. Nitrogen generally has a more consistent shot than CO2. This is because when the playing area is warm, the CO2 will expand more rapidly from the liquid form, causing the marker to fire at a higher velocity. But when the temperature is lower, the expansion occurs more slowly, causing a decrease in the velocity of the shot. This is especially apparent during rapid firing while using CO2. The rapid discharge of CO2 causes the temperature of the liquid CO2 to drop dramatically, resulting in a significant loss in pressure. The effect of temperature on HPA or nitrogen, on the other hand, is negligible. However, CO2 tanks are significantly cheaper than nitrogen tanks. The nitrogen tanks traditionally cost slightly less to be filled than the CO2 tanks at approximately three to five US dollars. Also, many fields offer better rates for HPA fills due to the lower cost to the field; HPA {{is generally}} cheaper to procure as it has myriad industrial applications, and the field can even purchase the equipment to pressurize their own cylinders on-site. CO2, on the other hand, must be separated from other gases before bottling, usually through super-cooling air to the condensation point of each gas, a process that requires far more sophisticated and expensive equipment.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{flammable}} gas and high voltage in detector systems {{is common in}} many experiments at Fermilab. To mitigate the hazards associated with these systems, Fermilab Engineering Standard SD- 45 B (Ref. 1) was adopted. Since this note {{is meant to be}} a guide and not a mandatory standard, each experiment is reviewed for compliance with SD- 45 B by the {{flammable gas}} safety subcommittee. Currently, there are only two types of flammable gas in use, ethane (Appendix A) and methane (Appendix B). The worst flammable-gas case is C 2 H 6 (ethane), which has an estimated flow rate that is 73 % of the CH 4 (methane) flow but a heat of combustion (in kcal/g-mole) that is 173 % of that of methane. In the worst case, if ethane were to spew through its restricting orifice into its gas line at 0 psig and then through a catastrophic leak into Room 215 (TRD) or Room 511 (CDC/FDCNTX), the time that would be required to build up a greater than Class 1 inventory (0. 4 kg H 2 equivalent) would be 5. 2 hours (Ref. 2). Therefore a worst-case flammable gas leak would have to go undetected for over 5 hours in order to transform a either mixing room to an environment with a Risk Class greater than Class 1. The mixing systems, gas lines, and detectors themselves will be thoroughly leak checked prior to active service. All vessels {{that are part of the}} mixing systems will be protected from <b>overpressure</b> by safety <b>valves</b> vented outside the building. Both the input and output of all detector volumes are protected from overpressure in the same way. The volume immediately outside the central tracking detectors is continuously purged by nitrogen from boiloff from the main nitrogen dewar at the site. However, if flammable gas were to build up in the mixing rooms or particular detector areas, no matter how unlikely, flammable gas detectors that are part of the interlock chain of each gas mixing system will shut down the appropriate system. This includes shutting off the output of flammable gas manifolds within the gas shed. Similarly, if a fire were to break out anywhere in the D-ZERO Hall, fire sensors would stop the output of all flammable gas manifolds within the gas shed, by unpowering electrically controlled solenoid valves that are normally closed in the event of a power failure. Fire sensor contacts have not yet been installed...|$|R
