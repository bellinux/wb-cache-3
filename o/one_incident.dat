5|$|Sportswriter Fuzzy Woodruff, {{a witness}} to the game, wrote:Under Heisman's tutelage, Auburn played with a {{marvelous}} speed and dash that couldn't be gainsaid and which fairly swept Sewanee off its feet.

I recall vividly <b>one</b> <b>incident</b> of the game, which demonstrates clearly just how surprising was Sewanee's victory.|$|E
5|$|At 18:18 night {{began to}} fall. The Luftwaffe sent bombers from KG 1, 2, 3, 27 and 53 to bomb targets at Sheffield, Leeds, Hull, Colchester, Canvey Island, Manningtree and Sealand. British records {{mentioned}} damage only at Sealand. Most bombs were scattered over rural districts. In <b>one</b> <b>incident,</b> a KG 27 He 111, shortly before midnight, attacked the flying and training school at Windrush, in Gloucestershire, where night flying was in progress. The bomber, piloted by Alfred Dreher, crashed into an Avro Anson piloted by Sergeant Bruce Hancock. Both aircraft crashed, killing all five men involved.|$|E

5|$|No threats {{came upon}} the embassy during the day, {{although}} truckloads of armed Somalis frequently drove by the embassy along Afghoy Road. Only <b>one</b> <b>incident</b> seemed to directly target the embassy.

In <b>one</b> <b>incident,</b> black street repairmen received pay for two hours when they were sent home because of bad weather, but white employees were paid for the full day.|$|E
5|$|The birds aggressively {{defend their}} nests and {{surrounding}} areas against other birds and animals. When a predator is persistent, mockingbirds from neighboring territories may be summoned by distinct calls {{to join the}} defense. Other birds may gather to watch as the mockingbirds harass the intruder. In addition to harassing domestic cats and dogs that they consider a threat, mockingbirds will at times target humans. The birds are unafraid and will attack much larger birds, even hawks. <b>One</b> <b>incident</b> in Tulsa, Oklahoma involving a postal carrier resulted {{in the distribution of}} a warning letter to residents.|$|E

The news item reported that a portion of Kentuckians crew went on strike in protest against unsafe working conditions. The ship's master had ordered the deckhands to rig one of the cargo booms after the ship docked in Los Angeles, but they refused because the deck was slippery and therefore, in their opinion, unsafe.|$|E
5|$|Worle {{has had a}} {{large number}} of {{incidents}} of railway vandalism and antisocial behaviour, and the stretch of line through Worle {{is considered one of the}} most vandalised in the United Kingdom– obstructions have been left on the line and stones have being thrown at railway staff. There have been several incidents of train guards being attacked by passengers who refused to pay their fares, including <b>one</b> <b>incident</b> where the guard was dragged from the train and knocked to the ground. Vandals have also damaged the station's ticket machines, attacked passengers and slashed the tyres of cars parked at the station.|$|E
5|$|Allen's {{exploits}} {{in those}} years {{introduced him to the}} wrong side of the justice system, which would become a recurring feature of his life. In <b>one</b> <b>incident,</b> he and his brother Heman went to the farm of a neighbor, some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land, and seized the pigs. The neighbor sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen pleaded his own case, and lost. Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings, and the neighbor was awarded another five shillings in damages. He was also called to court in Salisbury for inoculating himself against smallpox, a procedure that at the time required the sanction of the town selectmen.|$|E

5|$|Clemmons {{was accused}} {{multiple}} times of displaying violent behavior during court appearances. In <b>one</b> <b>incident,</b> he dismantled a metal door stop and hid {{it in his}} sock {{to use as a}} weapon. It was discovered and confiscated by a court bailiff. In another incident, he took a lock from his holding cell and threw it at a bailiff, but missed and accidentally hit his mother instead. Clemmons was once accused of reaching for a guard's pistol while being transported to court. During one trial, he was shackled in leg irons and seated next to a uniformed officer because the presiding judge ordered extra security, claiming Clemmons had threatened him. At age 16, Clemmons' charges were committed from juvenile court to adult court due to the extremely violent nature of his crimes and demeanor.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez {{tried to}} put the {{frontier}} fortresses in the hands of his adherents but failed. Miaczinski botched the attempted seizure of Lille and was later executed. Dumouriez believed that he could control the regular infantry and cavalry regiments. On the other hand, the volunteers and the artillery remained devoted to the National Convention. In <b>one</b> <b>incident,</b> Dumouriez was fired on and nearly arrested by Louis-Nicolas Davout's volunteer battalion. He then made the mistake of being seen with an Austrian escort and the gunners took the lead in refusing to obey him. Seeing that his plot had fallen apart, Dumouriez defected to the Austrians on 5 April 1793. He was accompanied by the Duke of Chartres, Valence, several more generals and some cavalry. No longer bound by the previous agreement, Coburg prepared to invade France.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{most cases}} of {{fluoride}} poisoning {{have been caused}} by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides. Most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste. Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause: <b>one</b> <b>incident</b> in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person. Dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste. One regional study examined a year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases, including one death from ingesting insecticide. Most had no symptoms, but about 30% had stomach pains. A larger study across the U.S. had similar findings: 80% of cases involved children under six, and there were few serious cases.|$|E

5|$|In South Korea, {{damage was}} {{heaviest}} in South Gyeongsang Province, where 71people were killed. Damage was particularly heavy in Busan, {{as well in}} as Yecheon, Ulsan, and Daegu. In Busan, strong winds wrecked 11lifting cranes, each weighing about 900tons, which injured five people and killed two in <b>one</b> <b>incident.</b> Many shipyards in the region were closed, and initial reports estimated {{it would take a}} year to fully reopen the Busan port. The estimated damage to the Busan port was about $50million (USD), causing cargo capacity to be cut by 20%. High waves turned a large ship on its side in Busan, and in Ulsan the waves knocked an offshore shipbuilding plant into a petroleum facility, damaging them both. Sixteen people were killed in Busan.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Reno Gang and other criminals, several white cap groups began operating in the state, primarily in the southern counties. They began carrying out lynchings against suspected criminals, leading the state to attempt {{to crack down on}} their practices. By the turn of the 20th century, they had become so notorious that anti-lynching laws were passed and in <b>one</b> <b>incident</b> the governor called out the militia to protect a prisoner. When the white caps showed up to lynch him, the militia opened fire, killing one and wounding eleven. Vigilante activity decreased following the incident, and remained low until the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Large swells {{produced}} by the storm resulted in about 1,000 lifeguard rescues in Orange County, California. High temperatures in southern California, exceeding 100°F (37.7°C) in places, and cool ocean temperatures led to an estimated 575,000 people going to beaches during the Labor Day weekend. <b>One</b> <b>incident</b> required 25 rescues as dozens of people were overwhelmed by 810ft (2.43m) waves. Officials in San Bernardino County advised residents to take precautions {{for the possibility of}} flooding as a result of moisture from the remnants of Howard. Following wildfires in 2003, foothills were highly susceptible to flooding. Residents were advised to have sandbags ready, ensure their emergency supplies were stocked and have an evacuation plan. Despite all the preparations undertaken, Howard did not produced any rainfall in California. The moisture also enhanced rainfall across portions of Arizona. This led to minor rainfall accumulations throughout the state.|$|E
