Every κ-Suslin graph G <b>on</b> <b>reals</b> satisfies one of {{the following}} two requirements: (I) G admits a (κ + 1) -Borel colouring by ordinals below κ; (II) there exists a continuous homomorphism (in some cases an embedding) of a certain locally countable Borel graph G 0 into G. Theorem 2. In the Solovay model, every OD graph G <b>on</b> <b>reals</b> satisfies {{one of the}} following two requirements: (I) G admits an OD colouring by countable ordinals; (II) as above.

40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this work}} is to propose and discuss a {{representation}} of Real Numbers {{in the context of}} Logical Frameworks, i. e. generic interactive proof assistants based on Type Theory. This is a first step towards computer assisted reasoning <b>on</b> <b>reals,</b> and it should provide a workbench for certifying algorithms <b>on</b> exact <b>reals.</b> In recent years there has been growing interest in exact real number computation [PEE 97,Wei 97]. This approach to computation <b>on</b> <b>reals</b> allows to produce results with arbitrary precision, thus avoiding round off errors typical of limited precision practice, without having to carry out any independent error analysis. Since exact computation is among other things motivated by software reliability reasons, it is important to validate algorithms which manipulate exact reals. Logical frameworks are useful to carry out such a purpose, because they permit to represent real numbers and to formalize algorithms which manipulate them, thus allowing to stud...|$|R

Due to technical restraints, bipedal creatures also provided greater flexibility for animation and game dynamics.|$|E

5|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within {{the television and}} entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television licence fee on the programme.

Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an accident and emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.|$|E
