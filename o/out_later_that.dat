25|$|With the {{installation}} of Pakubuwana, the Dutch substantially increased their control over the interior of Central Java. Pakubuwana I was {{more than willing to}} agree to anything the VOC asked of him. In 1705 he agreed to cede the regions of Cirebon and eastern part of Madura (under Cakraningrat II), in which Mataram had no real control anyway, to the VOC. The VOC was given Semarang as new headquarters, the right to build fortresses anywhere in Java, a garrison in the kraton in Kartasura, monopoly over opium and textiles, and the right to buy as much rice as they wanted. Mataram would pay an annual tribute of 1300 metric tons of rice. Any debt made before 1705 was cancelled. In 1709, Pakubuwana I made another agreement with the VOC in which Mataram would pay annual tribute of wood, indigo and coffee (planted since 1696 by VOC’s request) in addition to rice. These tributes, more than anything else, made Pakubuwana I the first genuine puppet of the Dutch. On paper, these terms seemed very advantageous to the Dutch, since the VOC itself was in financial difficulties during the period of 1683–1710. But the ability of the king to fulfil the terms of agreement depended largely on the stability of Java, for which VOC has made a guarantee. It turned <b>out</b> <b>later</b> <b>that</b> the VOC’s military might was incapable of such a huge task.|$|E

500|$|Political {{tensions}} in England began to rise, however, {{and a potential}} conflict between King John and an alliance of rebel barons opposed to his rule began to look likely.

For the remainder of his life, Strummer largely disowned the album, although he did profess that [...] "I really like 'This Is England' [...] 'North and South' is a vibe." [...] In early 1986, the Clash disbanded. Strummer later described the group's end: [...] "When the Clash collapsed, we were tired. There had been a lot of intense activity in five years.
