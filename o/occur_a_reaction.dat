25|$|Nifedipine rapidly lowers blood pressure, and {{patients}} are commonly warned {{they may feel}} dizzy or faint after taking the first few doses.

2500|$|When a {{chemical}} substance is transformed {{as a result}} of its interaction with another substance or with energy, <b>a</b> chemical <b>reaction</b> is said to have <b>occurred.</b> <b>A</b> chemical <b>reaction</b> is therefore <b>a</b> concept related to the [...] "reaction" [...] of a substance when it comes in close contact with another, whether as a mixture or a solution; exposure to some form of energy, or both. It results in some energy exchange between the constituents of the reaction as well as with the system environment, which may be designed vessels—often laboratory glassware.|$|R
50|$|Nucleophilic {{abstraction}} can <b>occur</b> on <b>a</b> ligand of a metal if {{the conditions}} are right.

50|$|Immunosuppression is a {{reduction}} of the activation or efficacy {{of the immune system}}.

5000|$|In {{intramolecular}} organic reactions, two reaction {{sites are}} contained {{within a single}} molecule.

50|$|When {{the body}} is exposed to the cold in {{individuals}} afflicted by the condition, hives appear and the skin in the affected area typically becomes itchy. Hives result from dilation of capillaries which allow fluid to flow out into the surrounding tissue which is the epidermis.They resolve when the body absorbs this fluid. The border of a hive is described as polycyclic, or made up of many circles, and changes as fluid leaks out and then is absorbed. Pressing on a hive causes the skin to blanch distinguishing it from a bruise or papule. Hives can last {{for a few minutes}} or a few days, and vary from person to person. Also, <b>a</b> burning sensation <b>occurs.</b> During <b>a</b> severe <b>reaction,</b> low blood pressure, which can be life-threatening, can <b>occur.</b> <b>A</b> serious <b>reaction</b> is most likely to occur if the hives occur with less than 3 minutes of exposure (during a cold test).|$|R
50|$|Like {{positive}} moods, negative moods {{have important}} implications for human mental and physical wellbeing. Moods are basic psychological states that can <b>occur</b> as <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> to <b>an</b> event or can surface for no apparent external cause. Since there is no intentional object that causes the negative mood, it has no specific start and stop date. It can last for hours, days, weeks, or longer. Negative moods can manipulate how individuals interpret and translate the world around them, and can also direct their behavior.|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} of coralyne with poly(A) •poly(U), poly(A) • 2 poly(U), poly(A) and poly(A) •poly(A) is analysed using spectrophotometric, spectrofluorometric, circular dichroism (CD), viscometric, stopped-flow and temperature-jump techniques. It is shown {{for the first}} time that coralyne induces disproportionation of poly(A) •poly(U) to triplex poly(A) • 2 poly(U) and single-stranded poly(A) under suitable values of the [dye]/[polymer] ratio (CD/CP). Kinetic, CD and spectrofluorometric experiments reveal that this process requires that coralyne (D) binds to duplex. The resulting complex (AUD) reacts with free duplex giving triplex (UAUD) and free poly(A); moreover, ligand exchange between duplex and triplex <b>occurs.</b> <b>A</b> <b>reaction</b> mechanism is proposed and the reaction parameters are evaluated. For CD/CP> 0. 8 poly(A) •poly(U) does not disproportionate at 25 °C and dye intercalation into AU to give AUD is the only observed process. Melting experiments as well show that coralyne induces the duplex disproportionation. Effects of temperature, ionic strength and ethanol content are investigated. One concludes that triplex formation requires coralyne be only partially intercalated into AUD. Under suitable concentration conditions, this feature favours the {{interaction of}} free AU with AUD to give the AUDAU intermediate which evolves into triplex UAUD and single-stranded poly(A). Duplex poly(A) •poly(A) undergoes aggregation as well, but only at much higher polymer concentrations compared to poly(A) •poly(U) ...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} try to assess the extent of {{inhibition}} that <b>occurs</b> in <b>a</b> <b>reaction,</b> <b>a</b> control can be performed by adding a known amount of a template to the investigated reaction mixture (based on the sample under analysis).

Of course, if any part of the inhibition occurring in the sample-derived reaction mixture is sequence-specific, then this method will yield an underestimate of the inhibition as it applies to the investigate sequence(s).|$|R
50|$|The {{geologic}} {{occurrence of}} Iddingsite {{is limited to}} extrusive or hypabyssal rocks, and it is absent from deep-seated rocks.
