5|$|Diệm's {{victory was}} seen as a blow to French stature in Vietnam, as the former colonial power had helped to set up Bảo Đại's State of Vietnam in 1949. They {{consistently}} opposed Diệm and his policies, and unsuccessfully tried to impede him. The U.S. media regarded Diệm's victory as a signal that the United States would be the only Western power in South Vietnam. Some felt that this would enable Diệm to rule effectively without French hindrance, while others felt that this would leave too much <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> on the American government. The French media and diplomatic corps viewed the result as a humiliation. Before the poll, French officials had privately predicted Diệm would dissolve the French High Command and use any victory as justification for scrapping the national reunification elections. The French media viewed the poll as undemocratic and a plot by the Americans to sabotage any prospect of national reunification, but France recognised the Republic of Vietnam soon after.|$|E
5|$|Urobuchi {{stated that}} Sayaka was his {{favorite}} character overall, and remarked that her plotline was the most enjoyable to write. Due to her grim fate {{by the end of}} the series, a destiny that Shinbo believed was slightly unfair, he asked Urobuchi if it was possible to change the plot so that Sayaka could be spared. Urobuchi declined, asserting that her death was too integral to the overarching story. Shinbo then inquired if there were any way that she could be brought back to life, admitting he had become very attached to the character. However, Urobuchi again refused, explaining that this would be impossible with regard to the already-established rules governing the story. Shinbo finally acquiesced to this, but remarked that he believed there may have been too large <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> placed on the characters who were in essence young middle school girls.|$|E

40|$|Caregiver burden {{has been}} studied at length in {{caregivers}} of many populations of chronically ill people. The {{other side of the}} informal caregiving relationship is the recipient's response to aid, especially their perceptions of the burden they pose to their caregiver. This is referred to as self-perceived burden, and has rarely been studied from the patient's point of view. Strong feelings <b>of</b> being <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> may be <b>an</b> important emotional factor influencing adjustment to illness, compliance with physician's orders, utilization of health-care resources and end-of-life decision-making. The current study advances the current understanding of self-perceived burden through the development and preliminary validation of the Self-Perceived Burden Scale. Through the course of this study, we have developed a valuable screening instrument for feelings <b>of</b> being <b>a</b> <b>burden.</b> It is brief, easily self-administered, and reliably identifies individuals in emotional distress due to feelings <b>of</b> being <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> on others.

25|$|The Protestant Reformation in Europe {{that began}} in 1517 with Martin Luther (1483–1546) spread to Estonia in the 1520s. The Reformation in Estonia was {{inspired}} and organized by local and Swedish secular and religious authorities – especially {{after the end of}} the Livonian War in 1582. Lutheranism spread literacy among the young, and it transformed religious art. However, the peasants were traditionalists and were more comfortable with Catholic traditions; they delayed the adoption of the new religion. After 1600, Swedish Lutheranism began to dominate the building, furnishing, and (modest) decoration of new churches. Church architecture was now designed to encourage congregational understanding of and involvement in the services. Pews and seats were installed for the common people to make listening to the sermon less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>burden,</b> and altars often featured depictions of the Last Supper, but images and statues of the saints had disappeared. The Baltic German elite promoted Lutheranism, and language, education, religion and politics were greatly transformed. Church services were now given in the local vernacular, instead of Latin, and the first book was printed in Estonian.|$|E
25|$|Burrolandia, or the Donkey Sanctuary of Mexico, is {{an animal}} shelter {{that specializes in}} donkeys and {{contains}} about twenty animals. Burrolandia was begun by the Flores family on land next to the family's home in 2006. It is not scenic, as donkeys wander around rusting 1940s era cars. Visitors are given donkey ears and tails to wear as they visit a small museum, along with papier-mâché burros. There are puppet shows and burro rides. Burroland is sustained by donations from visitors, local companies and international groups like Donkey Sanctuary in Britain. Despite the animals’ historical importance in Mexico, pick up trucks and tractors are preferred by farmers even in the poorest areas. While the animals may still have their place culturally, the lack of work has made them more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> than an asset. The donkey population plummeted from one million in 1991 to about 581,000 in 2007 as many were killed by their owners or sold to slaughterhouses. Another reason farmers {{get rid of the}} animals is that they are associated with backwardness, and now the animals are not even worth 500 pesos anymore. This has spawned the Otumba effort to create the sanctuary as well as other projects such as free veterinary care for those animals still on farms.|$|E
25|$|In premodern China, {{the need}} for credit and for {{circulating}} a medium that was less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> than exchanging thousands of copper coins led {{to the introduction of}} paper money, commonly known today as banknotes. This economic phenomenon was a slow and gradual process that took place from the late Tang dynasty (618–907) into the Song dynasty (960–1279). It began as a means for merchants to exchange heavy coinage for receipts of deposit issued as promissory notes from shops of wholesalers, notes that were valid for temporary use in a small regional territory. In the 10th century, the Song dynasty government began circulating these notes amongst the traders in their monopolized salt industry. The Song government granted several shops the sole right to issue banknotes, and in the early 12th century the government finally took over these shops to produce state-issued currency. Yet the banknotes issued were still regionally valid and temporary; {{it was not until the}} mid 13th century that a standard and uniform government issue of paper money was made into an acceptable nationwide currency. The already widespread methods of woodblock printing and then Pi Sheng's movable type printing by the 11th century was the impetus for the massive production of paper money in premodern China.|$|E

500|$|Crofts was a {{first team}} regular in the 2004–05 season, making 27 Football League appearances, and scoring his first senior goal for the club in a defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion on 26 December. In January 2005, he signed a new {{contract}} designed to keep him at the club until 2009. He was omitted from the team for most of March and April, but was recalled for the last match of the season, in which a draw with Nottingham Forest led to the [...] "Gills" [...] being relegated from the Football League Championship, the second tier of English football, to Football League One, the third tier. In the 2005–06 season, he made the most appearances of any player in the Gillingham squad, missing {{only one of the}} team's 46 matches in League One. Although the team struggled in the league, finishing in {{the lower half of the}} table, they defeated Premier League team Portsmouth in the League Cup, with Crofts scoring the winning goal. The following season, he again made over 40 appearances and also scored eight goals, his best total for an individual season, but Gillingham again finished the season in the bottom half of the table. He made his 100th start for the club on 18 December 2006 in a match against Bournemouth, and marked the occasion with a goal. At the end of the season, he won four awards at the club's Player of the Year event and was dubbed Mr Gillingham by then-manager Ronnie Jepson. He took over as team captain in the 2007–08 season, but it was an unsuccessful season for the team, who were relegated from League One. The following October he was stripped of the captaincy, which was instead given to Barry Fuller. Manager Mark Stimson stated that he felt that the captaincy might have been too much <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> for Crofts, and had a negative effect on his form. Soon afterwards, the club made Crofts available for transfer.|$|E
500|$|The double {{burden is}} usually {{view as a}} primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less {{recognized}} that men can and often do {{go through the same}} trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family. Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis, Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, [...] "Social science fails to understand men" [...] by tending [...] "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between work and home for men." [...] Married men can avoid the full impact of the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work. Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor. Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women. However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as a woman does. They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities. Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability be a parent, and they are challenged psychologically. [...] "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents. He has to change the way he feels about himself as man." [...] A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career. A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> for them to balance both work and the family. With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.|$|E

[...] Lee stated a few days after the loss that he was relieved <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>burden,</b> and that it was a [...] "luxurious feeling" [...] coming upon problems that he would not have to worry about. [...] However, acquaintances and staff members commented that he seemed melancholic and deflated. [...] Many of his staff shared the same feelings, since the loss was unexpected and most did not have any contingency plans.|$|E

2500|$|Surgery is {{increasingly}} performed via laparoscopic techniques. [...] Commonly {{referred to as}} key hole surgery, this surgery {{does not have the}} large incisions seen in a classically performed radical or partial nephrectomy, but still successfully removes either {{all or part of the}} kidney. Laparoscopic surgery is associated with shorter stays in the hospital and quicker recovery time but there are still risks associated with the surgical procedure. These have the advantage of being less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> for the patient and the disease-free survival is comparable to that of open surgery. [...] For small exophytic lesions that do not extensively involve the major vessels or urinary collecting system, a partial nephrectomy (also referred to as [...] "nephron sparing surgery") can be performed. [...] This may involve temporarily stopping blood flow to the kidney while the mass is removed as well as renal cooling with an ice slush. Mannitol can also be administered to help limit damage to the kidney. [...] This is usually done through an open incision although smaller lesions can be done laparoscopically with or without robotic assistance.|$|E
2500|$|According to Slavieck, the [...] "traditional {{interpretation}} of the treaty's impact on Germany" [...] was that it [...] "plunged the nation into an economic free fall". This view was shared by the German people, who believed the treaty was robbing Germany of its wealth. German banker Max Warburg said {{the terms of the}} treaty were [...] "pillage on a global scale". Niall Ferguson says the German view was incorrect and [...] "not many historians would today agree with Warburg". However, several historians agree with Warburg. [...] Norman Davies writes that the treaty forced Germany to [...] "pay astronomic reparations", while Tim McNeese states, [...] "France and Britain had placed war damages on Germany to the tune of billions of gold marks, which the defeated Germans could not begin to pay in earnest". Ferguson says the reparations were [...] "less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>burden</b> than Keynes and others claimed" [...] and that the [...] "potential burden on national income of the annuity vary from 5 percent to 10 percent". However, he cautions against underestimating the initial German effort to pay. Before the implementation of the Dawes Plan, Germany transferred between eight and 13 billion gold marks, which amounted to [...] "between 4 and 7 percent of total national income". Ferguson says [...] "the annuity demanded in 1921 put an intolerable strain on the state's finances" [...] and that total expenditure between 1920 and 1923 amounted to [...] "at least 50 percent of Reich revenue, 20 percent of total Reich spending and 10 percent of total public spending". Thus, Ferguson says, reparations [...] "undermined confidence in the Reich's creditworthiness" [...] and [...] "were therefore excessiveas the German government claimed".|$|E
