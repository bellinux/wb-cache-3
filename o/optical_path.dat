These problems were attributed to RAN demands that the optical view be the first exposed when a periscope was raised above the water, instead of placing the infrared sensor and single-pulse radar at the head as on other submarines, requiring the <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> to be routed around these components. The periscopes were gradually improved, and were no longer a problem {{by the time the}} fast track submarines entered service.|$|E

25|$|The main {{mechanism}} for sorting is {{the arrangement of}} the optical lattice points. As the cell flow through the optical lattice, there are forces due to the particles drag force that is competing directly with the optical gradient force (See Physics of optical tweezers) from the optical lattice point. By shifting {{the arrangement of the}} optical lattice point, there is a preferred <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> where the optical forces are dominant and biased. With the aid of the flow of the cells, there is a resultant force that is directed along that preferred <b>optical</b> <b>path.</b> Hence, there is a relationship of the flow rate with the optical gradient force. By adjusting the two forces, one will be able to obtain a good optical sorting efficiency.|$|E

25|$|OCT {{delivers}} {{high resolution}} {{because it is}} based on light, rather than sound or radio frequency. An optical beam is directed at the tissue, and a small portion of this light that reflects from sub-surface features is collected. Note that most light is not reflected but, rather, scatters off at large angles. In conventional imaging, this diffusely scattered light contributes background that obscures an image. However, in OCT, a technique called interferometry is used to record the <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> length of received photons allowing rejection of most photons that scatter multiple times before detection. Thus OCT can build up clear 3D images of thick samples by rejecting background signal while collecting light directly reflected from surfaces of interest.|$|E

This design was physically very long, leading to deep receiver chassis, but later versions folded the <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> using mirrors to produce a somewhat more practical system.

25|$|Snell's law can {{be derived}} from Fermat's principle, which states that the light travels the path which takes the least time. By taking the {{derivative}} of the <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> length, the stationary point is found giving the path taken by the light (though {{it should be noted that}} the result does not show light taking the least time path, but rather one that is stationary with respect to small variations as there are cases where light actually takes the greatest time path, as in a spherical mirror). In a classic analogy, the area of lower refractive index is replaced by a beach, the area of higher refractive index by the sea, and the fastest way for a rescuer on the beach to get to a drowning person in the sea is to run along a path that follows Snell's law.|$|E
25|$|Classically, Fermat's {{principle}} can {{be considered}} as a mathematical consequence of Huygens' principle. Indeed, of all secondary waves (along all possible paths) the waves with the extrema (stationary) paths contribute most due to constructive interference. Suppose that light waves propagate from A to B by all possible routes ABj, unrestricted initially by rules of geometrical or physical optics. The various optical paths ABj will vary by amounts greatly in excess of one wavelength, and so the waves arriving at B will have a large range of phases and will tend to interfere destructively. But if there is a shortest route AB0, and the <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> varies smoothly through it, then a considerable number of neighboring routes close to AB0 will have optical paths differing from AB0 by second-order amounts only and will therefore interfere constructively. Waves along and close to this shortest route will thus dominate and AB0 will be the route along which the light is seen to travel.|$|E

25|$|Crystal interferometry, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} X-ray interferometry, {{is the oldest}} but also the most complex method used for experimental realization. It consists of three beam splitters in Laue geometry aligned parallel to each other. (See figure to the right) The incident beam, which usually is collimated and filtered by a monochromator (Bragg crystal) before, is split at the first crystal (S) by Laue diffraction into two coherent beams, a reference beam which remains undisturbed and a beam passing through the sample. The second crystal (T) acts as a transmission mirror and causes the beams to converge one towards another. The two beams meet at {{the plane of the}} third crystal (A), which is sometimes called, the analyzer crystal, and create an interference pattern the form of which depends on the <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> difference between the two beams caused by the sample. This interference pattern is detected with an X-ray detector behind the analyzer crystal.|$|E

500|$|A {{common type}} (used in {{applications}} such as aircraft gun sights) uses a collimating lens and a beam splitter. This type tends to be bulky since it requires at least two optical components, the lens and the beam splitter/glass plate. The reticle collimation optics are situated at 90° to the <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> making lighting difficult, usually needing additional electric illumination, condensing lenses, etc. A more compact type replaces the lens/beam splitter configuration with a half silvered or dichroic curved collimating mirror set at an angle that performs both tasks of focusing and combining {{the image of an}} offset reticle. This type is most often seen as the red dot type used on small arms. It is also possible to place the reticle between the viewer and the curved mirror at the mirror's focus. The reticle itself is too close to the eye to be in focus but the curved mirror presents the viewer with an image of the reticle at infinity. This type was invented by Dutch optical engineer Lieuwe Van Albada in 1932, originally as a camera viewfinder, and was also used as a gunsight on World War II bazookas: the US M9 and M9A1 [...] "Bazooka" [...] featured the D7161556 folding [...] "Reflecting Sight Assembly".|$|E

500|$|The Mach–Zehnder {{interferometer}} is a {{more versatile}} instrument than the Michelson interferometer. Each of the well separated light paths is traversed only once, and the fringes can be adjusted {{so that they are}} localized in any desired plane. Typically, the fringes would be adjusted to lie in the same plane as the test object, so that fringes and test object can be photographed together. If it is decided to produce fringes in white light, then, since white light has a limited coherence length, on the order of micrometers, great care must be taken to equalize the optical paths or no fringes will be visible. [...] As illustrated in Fig.6, a compensating cell would be placed {{in the path of the}} reference beam to match the test cell. Note also the precise orientation of the beam splitters. The reflecting surfaces of the beam splitters would be oriented so that the test and reference beams pass through an equal amount of glass. In this orientation, the test and reference beams each experience two front-surface reflections, resulting in the same number of phase inversions. The result is that light traveling an equal <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference.|$|E
