5|$|Fungi are {{important}} crop pathogens, as they reproduce rapidly, affect {{a wide range}} of crops around the world, cause some 85% of plant diseases, and can create serious economic losses. The range of types of fungi involved is also wide, including Ascomycetes such as Fusarium causing wilt, Basidiomycetes such as Ustilago causing smuts and Puccinia causing cereal rusts, and Oomycetes such as Phytophthora causing potato late blight and the resulting Great Irish Famine of 1845-1849. Where crop diversity is low, and in particular where single varieties of major crops are nearly universal, fungal diseases can cause the loss of an entire crop, as with the potato in Ireland, and as with the monocultured crop <b>of</b> <b>maize</b> (<b>corn)</b> in the USA in 1970, where over a billion dollars' worth of production was lost. Similarly, the 'Gros Michel' seedless banana crop was essentially completely destroyed worldwide in the 1950s by the wild fungus, Fusarium oxysporum. It was replaced by the Cavendish banana, which in turn was in 2015 facing total destruction by the same disease.|$|E
25|$|In the USA {{there are}} tariffs on the {{importation}} of sugar, and subsidies for the production <b>of</b> <b>maize</b> (<b>corn).</b> High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is derived from corn, and significantly cheaper there than sucrose as a sweetener. This has led to sucrose being partially displaced in U.S. industrial food production by HFCS and other non-sucrose natural sweeteners.|$|E

Today The Maize Genetics Cooperation • Stock Center maintains a collection of more than 10,000genetic variations of maize that have arisen by random mutations and chromosomal variations from the original wild type.|$|E
2500|$|Nixtamalization [...] {{typically}} {{refers to}} a process for the preparation <b>of</b> <b>maize</b> (<b>corn),</b> or other grain, in which the corn is soaked and cooked in an alkaline solution, usually limewater (but sometimes wood ash lye) washed, and then hulled. This process, originating in Mexico, is famously known to remove up to 97-100% of aflatoxins from mycotoxin contaminated corn. The term can also refer to the removal via an alkali process of the pericarp from other grains such as sorghum.|$|E
2500|$|A tortilla seller is, in [...] or [...] The {{traditional}} tortilla {{has been}} made <b>of</b> <b>maize</b> <b>corn</b> since pre-Columbian times.

2500|$|Like other Iroquoian peoples, the Huron were {{farmers who}} {{supplemented}} their diet with hunting and fishing. The women cultivated varieties <b>of</b> <b>maize</b> (<b>corn),</b> squash and beans (the [...] "Three Sisters") as {{the mainstay of}} the tribal diet, which was supplemented primarily by fish caught by the men.

This was usually done by the slash-and-burn method of clearing trees and brush. Men did most of the fishing and hunting, and constructed the houses, canoes, and tools.

2500|$|According {{to another}} version of the myth, Quetzalcoatl {{is one of the}} four sons of Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl, the four Tezcatlipocas, each of whom presides over one of the four {{cardinal}} directions.

Over the East presides the Red Tezcatlipoca, Xipe Totec, the god of gold, farming and springtime. And over the North presides the Black Tezcatlipoca, known by no other name than Tezcatlipoca, the god of judgment, night, deceit, sorcery and the Earth. Quetzalcoatl was often considered the god of the morning star, and his twin brother Xolotl was the evening star (Venus). As the morning star, he was known by the title Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, meaning [...] "lord of the star of the dawn." [...] He was known as the inventor of books and the calendar, the giver <b>of</b> <b>maize</b> (<b>corn)</b> to mankind, and sometimes as a symbol of death and resurrection. Quetzalcoatl was also the patron of the priests and the title of the twin Aztec high priests. Some legends describe him as opposed to human sacrifice while others describe him practicing it.|$|E
