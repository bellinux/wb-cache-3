Vanadocene dichloride is a versatile starting reagent and even finds some applications in organic chemistry. Vanadium carbonyl, V(CO)6, is a rare example of a paramagnetic metal carbonyl.

5|$|The {{history of}} <b>organometallic</b> {{chemistry}} includes the 19th-century discoveries of Zeise's salt and nickel tetracarbonyl. These compounds posed {{a challenge to}} chemists as the compounds did not fit with existing chemical bonding models. A further challenge arose {{with the discovery of}} ferrocene, the iron analogue of rhodocene and the first of the class of compounds now known as metallocenes. Ferrocene was found to be unusually chemically stable, as were analogous chemical structures including rhodocenium, the unipositive cation of rhodocene and its cobalt and iridium counterparts. The study of <b>organometallic</b> species including these ultimately {{led to the development of}} new bonding models that explained their formation and stability. Work on sandwich compounds, including the rhodocenium-rhodocene system, earned Geoffrey Wilkinson and Ernst Otto Fischer the 1973 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The lead analog of the {{simplest}} organic compound, methane, is plumbane. Plumbane may be obtained in a reaction between metallic lead and atomic hydrogen. Two simple derivatives, tetramethyllead and tetraethyllead, are the best-known organolead compounds. These compounds are relatively stable: tetraethyllead only starts to decompose if heated or if exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light. (Tetraphenyllead is even more thermally stable, decomposing at 270°C.) With sodium metal, lead readily forms an equimolar alloy that reacts with alkyl halides to form <b>organometallic</b> compounds such as tetraethyllead. The oxidizing nature of many organolead compounds is usefully exploited: lead tetraacetate is an important laboratory reagent for oxidation in organic chemistry and tetraethyllead was once produced in larger quantities than any other <b>organometallic</b> compound. Other organolead compounds are less chemically stable. For many organic compounds, a lead analog does not exist.|$|E
5|$|The major {{advantage}} of this method over addition of <b>organometallic</b> reagents to more typical acyl compounds is that it avoids the common problem of over-addition. For these latter reactions, two equivalents of the incoming group add to form an alcohol rather than a ketone or aldehyde. This occurs even if the equivalents of nucleophile are closely controlled.|$|E

5|$|Weinreb and Nahm {{originally}} {{proposed the}} following reaction mechanism {{to explain the}} selectivity shown in reactions of the Weinreb–Nahm amide. Their suggestion was that the tetrahedral intermediate (A below) formed {{as a result of}} nucleophilic acyl substitution by the <b>organometallic</b> reagent is stabilized by chelation from the methoxy group as shown. This intermediate is stable only at low temperatures, requiring a low-temperature quench.|$|E
5|$|Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums {{may also}} react with N,N-disubstituted amides to give {{aldehydes}} and ketones, and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide. They thermally decompose {{to eliminate a}} β-hydrogen, producing alkenes and lithium hydride: another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as strong bases. In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids (ArCO2H) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'2C(Ar)OH). Finally, they {{may be used to}} synthesise other <b>organometallic</b> compounds through metal-halogen exchange.|$|E
5|$|In {{material}} sciences, many complicated inorganic and <b>organometallic</b> {{systems have}} been analyzed using single-crystal methods, such as fullerenes, metalloporphyrins, and other complicated compounds. Single-crystal diffraction is also used in the pharmaceutical industry, due to recent problems with polymorphs. The major factors affecting the quality of single-crystal structures are the crystal's size and regularity; recrystallization is a commonly used technique to improve these factors in small-molecule crystals. The Cambridge Structural Database contains over 800,000 structures as of September 2016; over 99% of these structures were determined by X-ray diffraction.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of reactive <b>organometallics</b> {{has become a}} vital part synthetic chemistry. Organosilanes potentially represent a cheap, robust, and environmentally benign precursor to reactive <b>organometallics,</b> but {{the nature of the}} very stable C−Si bond has generally prevented their use as precursors to more reactive <b>organometallics.</b> We present investigations into copper fluoride complexes which activate organosilanes in anhydrous media under mild conditions, effecting transmetalation to produce stable and in some cases isolable organocopper species containing sensitive functional groups including carbonyl groups, aryl bromides, benzylic chlorides, and alkyl ketones. This discovery allows us to better understand the fundamental reactivity of presumed intermediates in copper-catalyzed reactions and to develop new catalytic bond-forming processes including allylations of aldehydes, 1, 4 -addition of vinyl epoxides, and intramolecular ring closures...|$|R

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of lithium shows several differences {{from that of}} the rest of the group as the small Li+ cation polarises anions and gives its compounds a more covalent character.

In addition, among their respective groups, only lithium and magnesium form <b>organometallic</b> compounds with significant covalent character (e.g. LiMe and MgMe2).|$|E
