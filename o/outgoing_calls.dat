However, existing modems were simply too expensive and difficult to use or be practical for most users.

25|$|SPIT (SPam over Internet Telephony) is VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) spam, usually using SIP (Session Initiation Protocol). This {{is nearly}} {{identical}} to telemarketing calls over traditional phone lines. When the user chooses to receive the spam call, a pre-recorded spam message or advertisement is usually played back. This is generally easier for the spammer as VoIP services are cheap and easy to anonymize over the Internet, {{and there are many}} options for sending mass amounts of calls from a single location. Accounts or IP addresses being used for VoIP spam can usually be identified by a large number of <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls,</b> low call completion and short call length.|$|E

However, global roaming has to be activated and both incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> are charged to this account, and the call rate is around US$4 per minute; the incoming calls are via the GSM phone number of the account, with country code, etc., prefixed.

Mobile subscribers pay for the connection time (typically using in-plan or prepaid minutes) for both incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls.</b> For <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls,</b> any long distance charges are billed as if they originate at the GMSC, {{even though it is}} the visiting MSC that completes the connection to the PSTN.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} {{exploitation of}} the finite difference method (FDM) to estimate electric fields resulting from an overhead power transmission line. The proposed analysis not only investigates the electric field intensity of the power line, but also examines interference caused by a mobile phone operation, sending an <b>outgoing</b> <b>call.</b> By using the FDM, electric field distribution around a human and his/her mobile phone can be graphically presented. This could reveal comprehensive effects of using the mobile phone underneath the power line on the mobile phone user. For demonstration, A 69 -kV, 50 -Hz overhead power transmission line supported by a H-frame tower is employed for a case study. Area of 8 × 12 m 2 underneath the power line is discretized as a simulation domain. As a result, electric flux lines around a human with sending <b>outgoing</b> <b>call</b> is very steep sloped and have a descent direction towards the human who is using the mobile phone...|$|R
