5|$|The thicker {{end of the}} log, the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance.

At the side of ognjište where the thicker end is situated, the family may place a plowshare, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The cut surface of the thicker end is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak is laid on the fire.|$|E

25|$|The {{centre of}} Yahweh's worship lay in three great annual festivals coinciding with major events in rural life: Passover with the {{birthing}} <b>of</b> <b>lambs,</b> Shavuot with the cereal harvest, and Sukkot with the fruit harvest. These probably pre-dated {{the arrival of}} the Yahweh religion, but they became linked to events in the national mythos of Israel: Passover with the exodus from Egypt, Shavuot with the law-giving at Sinai, and Sukkot with the wilderness wanderings. The festivals thus celebrated Yahweh's salvation of Israel and Israel's status as his holy people, although the earlier agricultural meaning was not entirely lost. His worship presumably involved sacrifice, but many scholars have concluded that the rituals detailed in Leviticus 1–16, with their stress on purity and atonement, were introduced only after the Babylonian exile, and that in reality any head of a family was able to offer sacrifice as occasion demanded. (A number of scholars have also drawn the conclusion that infant sacrifice, whether to the underworld deity Molech or to Yahweh himself, was a part of Israelite/Judahite religion until the reforms of King Josiah in the late 7th century BCE). Sacrifice was presumably complemented by the singing or recital of psalms, but again the details are scant. Prayer played little role in official worship.|$|E
25|$|Sheep are {{sometimes}} eaten in considerable numbers, {{especially in the}} Inner and Outer Hebrides of Scotland (25.9% and 26.8% of nest remains respectively). Differentiating whether a lamb has been caught and killed while alive or scavenged as a carcass is possible if the remains are in good condition. In one examination of 10 such remains in nests in Scotland, {{it was found that}} 3 lambs had been taken alive and 7 after they had died. This suggests the majority <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> are taken as carrion, which is reinforced by the fact that much ungulate carrion found around active nest sites in Scotland is already in a malodorous and putrid state. Domestic goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) are occasionally predated as well. Goats slightly outnumbered sheep in the diet of eagles breeding on Corsica, with both domesticated animals making up 20.5% of the diet there and being the most important food source. In North America, lambs and goats were found to comprise less than 1.4% of all prey items. In Montana, it was found that most predation on lambs by golden eagles was committed by juvenile eagles or eagles that failed to breed (which have no need to carry prey to a nest). There {{it was found that the}} hunting of domestic stock peaks during wet, cold springs that seemed to adversely effect the local abundance of jackrabbits. Pigs (including feral and domestic varieties) are occasionally taken, especially in insular populations. Studies showed pigs (most certainly taken as carrion) made up to 13.3% of the diet in Corsica and 43.1% on Santa Cruz Island, California. Few wild pigs co-exist with golden eagles but wild boar (Sus scrofa) (likely only as piglets or carrion) have been taken in Bulgaria.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the demand and price characteristics for lamb in the US and Oregon. The primary objective was to estimate coefficients for three variables in a demand function for lamb, and these variables were the production <b>of</b> <b>lamb,</b> the production <b>of</b> substitute meats, and an income factor. Two secondary objectives were to determine the influence of imported mutton on the price <b>of</b> <b>lamb,</b> and to consider the future trend in the price <b>of</b> <b>lamb.</b> The analysis consisted of two parts, the development of a single equation demand function for lamb and the formation of a structural model of the sheep industry. In both cases the price <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> was taken as a dependent variable, and price flexibility coefficients were estimated for the other variables. The flexibility coefficient for the production <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> was estimated to be 0. 88 in the single equation and - 1. 22 in the structural model. The structural flexibility was considered to be the best estimate as the validity of this coefficient did not depend on the assumption that the quantity <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> produced was determined independently of the price. There were indications that the current price <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> did influence the quantity produced. The conclusion reached was that the price was slightly flexible to changes in lamb production. The flexibility coefficient for the production of substitute meats was - 1. 11 in the single equation and - 1. 18 in the structural model. The high flexibility coefficient indicates that the level of production of substitute meats is important in determining the price <b>of</b> <b>lamb.</b> The flexibility coefficient for the income variable was + 0. 20 in the single equation and + 0. 42 in the structural model. Both estimates show a positive inflexible relationship with the price. To evaluate the impact of imports on the price <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> it was found necessary to estimate the annual production of mutton in the US, as no data give this information directly. A variable for the total quantity of mutton was included in the single equation demand function. The price decline associated with the increase of imports was estimated to be small. Although the total quantity of mutton increased by 39 percent between 1958 and 1959, over 93 percent of the decline in price was attributed to other variables. The flexibility coefficient for the production <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> in Oregon was estimated to be - 0. 54. This indicates a greater inflexibility <b>of</b> the <b>lamb</b> price than was found for the US. A higher flexibility of the price was associated with the production <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> in California. This indicated that California provides an important outlet for the marketing <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> from Oregon. The production of substitute meats and the income variable have expanded consistently throughout the period of the analysis. The net effect of these two variables was estimated from the structural model to cause a decrease in the price <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> <b>of</b> 0. 67 /cwt each year. However, the model indicates that producers tend to reduce the size of the breeding flock in response to a decline in price. This reduction and the decrease in the size <b>of</b> the <b>lamb</b> crop that would follow are expected to partially offset the price decline. The conclusion reached is that lamb prices can only be maintained at the present level if the size of the breeding flock decreases...|$|R

The dispersion equation <b>of</b> <b>Lamb</b> waves with the liquid loadings is derived. The impact of the liquid loadings is studied on the propagation <b>of</b> <b>Lamb</b> waves. The effect of the characteristic length is also studied on the phase velocity <b>of</b> <b>Lamb</b> waves in the plate for various modes in the presence of liquid loadings...|$|R
