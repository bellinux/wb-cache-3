40|$|Forty-two <b>ovine</b> <b>pestivirus</b> isolates, {{collected}} {{over a period}} of 18 years, were compared by phylogenetic analysis. The viruses were mostly field isolates from Britain; two others originated from Sweden and two from New Zealand. RT–PCR products were obtained from two genomic regions, one within the 5 �noncoding (5 �-NC) region, and the other encompassing parts of the p 20 (N pro) and C coding regions. Direct sequencing of the 5 �-NC PCR products, followed by computer-assisted phylogenetic analysis, divided the <b>ovine</b> <b>pestiviruses</b> into three main genotypes. The results demonstrated that sheep may naturally be infected not only with border disease virus (BDV), but also with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) types I and II. The BDV isolates segregated into two principal subtypes represented by the Moredun strain from Scotland and the 137 / 4 strain from England. The BVDV-I group was composed of three clusters, two of them represented by BVDV reference strains NADL and Osloss, respectively, and the third by ovine isolates D 1120 / 1 and D 1432 /P. The grouping of <b>ovine</b> <b>pestiviruses,</b> based on comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5 �-NC region, was confirmed by comparative analysis of the p 20 (N pro) and C coding regions, performed both at the nucleotide and at the amino acid level. The presence of three genotypes in sheep, including BVDV-I and BVDV-II, indicates the inadequacy of the current hostspecies-based nomenclature and classification of pestiviruses...|$|R

In this work, we compared single dose experimental inoculation of calves with Border disease virus with co-mingling of calves with sheep persistently infected with this virus.

40|$|This Technote {{contains}} {{data from}} an Alice Springs district property, for serum antibody titres to bovine pestivirus. Descriptive {{analysis of the}} data is used to illustrate a discussion about bovine <b>pestivirus</b> <b>infection</b> in cattle herds, and the management implications of this virus in extensive cattle herds of Central Australia. BACKGROUND Bovine pestivirus is the pathogenic agent of bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) and mucosal disease (MD). The virus occurs world-wide (Radostits et al. 2000) including in cattle herds of Australia and New Zealand (Littlejohns and Horner 1990). The epidemiology of bovine pestivirus disease is dependent on pre-natal and post-natal infection of cattle that have not been previously infected with bovine <b>pestivirus</b> (‘naïve’). Post-natal <b>infection</b> of ‘naïve’, pregnant cows is essential for spread of the virus via contamination from infected foetal material or production of persistently infected (PI) calves—sometimes over generations (Cook, Littlejohn and Jessep 1990; Littlejohns and Horner 1990). PI calves are life-long spreaders of the virus. In Australia, post-natal infection of ‘naïve’, non-pregnant cattle is believed to be transient and contributes little to the spread of bovine pestivirus or the profile of bovine pestivirus disease (Littlejohns and Horner 1990). Post-natal infection of ‘naïve’, pregnant cows is a prerequisite for the occurrence of the reported bovine pestivirus disease-syndromes associated with the stage of conception at which pre-natal infectio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCurrently, {{the genus}} Pestivirus {{comprises}} the four approved species Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV- 1), BVDV- 2, Classical {{swine fever virus}} (CSFV), and Border disease virus (BDV) and one tentative fifth species represented by a single strain (H 138) isolated from a giraffe in Kenya more than 30 years ago. To further {{address the issue of}} heterogeneity of pestiviruses we have determined the entire Npro and E 2 coding sequences for several new pestivirus isolates. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis revealed that one pestivirus isolated in the 1990 s in Africa is closely related to strain H 138. Moreover, several novel pestiviruses isolated from sheep group together with the previously described strain V 60 (Reindeer- 1) isolated from a reindeer, whereas one <b>ovine</b> <b>pestivirus</b> strain (Gifhorn) significantly differs from all previously described pestiviruses, including BDV. We propose to term these mainly sheep-derived pestiviruses BDV- 2 (V 60 -like isolates) and BDV- 3 (Gifhorn); consequently, the “classical” BDV isolates should be termed BDV- 1. As an additional criterion for segregation of pestiviruses, the antigenic relatedness of pestivirus isolates covering all observed major genotypes was studied by cross-neutralization assays. Analysis of the antigenic similarities indicated the presence of seven major antigenic groups corresponding to BVDV- 1, BVDV- 2, CSFV, BDV- 1, BDV- 2, BDV- 3, and “giraffe”. Taking into account the host origin, the lack of differences concerning the course of disease, and the results of our genetic and antigenic analyses, we suggest that BDV- 1, BDV- 2, and BDV- 3 should be considered as major genotypes within the species BDV...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the genetic heterogeneity of <b>ovine</b> <b>pestivirus</b> isolates in France, 32 -clinical samples collected between 1985 and 2006, previously detected positive by indirect immuno-fluorescence {{for the presence of}} Border disease virus (BDV), were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Parts of the 5 '-non-coding region (5 '-NCR) and the Npro-coding region were successfully amplified from 23 samples. An internal control was designed and used to assess the validity of negative RT-PCR results, which could be explained by RNA degradation during the storage of samples at - 20 degrees C for at least 16 years. A phylogenetic study was performed by using sequences obtained from the two loci. French isolates clustered into four distinct groups. Six isolates were assigned to the previously described BDV- 3 group. However, some isolates could not be assigned to any existing phylogenetic BDV groups, and therefore, tentative new phylogenetic groups are suggested. The AV strain, isolated in 1984 from sheep showing a severe hemorrhagic syndrome in the rearing region of Aveyron in France and sequenced during this study, should be considered as the strain model of the BDV- 5 group. Nine viral sequences clustered in a set distinct from all other groups were assigned to the BDV- 6 group. Two viral sequences were distinct from the BDV phylum and composed the last set assigned to the group of unclassified pestivirus that had been previously isolated in Tunisia.

The study material consisted of 40 organ materials collected from 13 aborted lambs, which were suspected to have pestiviruses, BDV and Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVDV). Viral nucleic acids were investigated by using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Nine of 13 aborted lambs (69. 2 %) and 24 of 40 organ samples (60 %) obtained from those sheep were BDV RNA positive, whilst all the animals and organ samples were BVDV-RNA negative.

Irrespective of the stage of pregnancy, virus inoculation resulted in reproductive failures, consisting of abortion, stillbirths or birth of weak or persistently infected (PI) lambs. Aborted fetuses, stillborn and dead lambs displayed extensive histopathological changes, consisting of hemorrhages, congestion and mononuclear infiltration in major organs. Pestiviral antigens were detected by immunohistochemistry in most tissues with remarkable signals in lungs and kidneys. PI lambs were constantly viremic, shed the virus through the nasal secretions and feces and, in all cases but one, did not have detectable HoBi-like pestivirus antibodies before the assumption of colostrum. The single seropositive infected lamb showed low-titer viremia and viral shedding that ceased only several weeks after the 3 -month observation period.

However, there is no information regarding any host binding partners for the E 2 proteins. Here, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid system and identified fifty-seven host proteins as positive binding partners which bound E 2 from both CSFV and BVDV with the exception of two proteins that were found to be positive for binding only to CSFV E 2. Alanine scanning of CSFV E 2 demonstrated that the binding sites for these cellular proteins on E 2 are likely non-linear binding sites.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} (Experiment 1, n = 12 Holstein-Friesian heifers; Experiment 11, n = 8 Jersey cows) {{were conducted}} to investigate the pathogenesis of bovine pestivirus-induced ovarian dysfunction in cattle. In both experiments the cattle were superovulated with twice daily injections of, a porcine pituitary extract preparation of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH-P), for 4 days commencing on Day 10 +/- 2 after a presynchronised oestrus. The heifers received a total dose of 30 mg and the cows 32 mg of FSH-P. Prostaglandin F- 2 alpha. (PGF(2 alpha)) was administered 48 h after commencement of superovulation and all cattle were artificially inseminated (AI) between 48 and 66 h after PGF(2 alpha) treatment. In both experiments bovine pestivirus seronegative cattle (Experiment I, n = 6; Experiment 11, n = 4) were inoculated intranasally with an Australian strain of non-cytopathogenic bovine pestivirus (bovine viral diarrhoea virus Type 1) 9 days prior to AI. Bovine <b>pestivirus</b> <b>infection</b> was confirmed by seroconversion and/or virus isolation {{in all of the}} inoculated cattle, consistent with a viremia occurring approximately between Day 5 prior to AI and the day of AI. Ovarian function was monitored in both experiments by daily transrectal ultrasonography and strategic blood sampling to determine progesterone, oestradiol- 17 beta, luteinising hormone (LH) and cortisol profiles. Non-surgical ova/embryo recovery was performed on Day 7 after AI. In Experiment 11 half the cattle were slaughtered on Day 2 and the remainder on Day 8 after Al, and the ovaries submitted for gross and histopathological examination including immunohistochemistry to demonstrate the presence of bovine pestivirus antigen. In both studies, comparisons were made between infected and confirmed uninfected (control) animals. Overall the bovine pestivirus infected cattle had significantly lower (P < 0. 05) ova/embryo recovery rates compared to the control cattle. There was evidence of either an absence (partial or complete) of a preovulatory LH surge or delay in timing of the LH peak in the majority (90 %) of infected heifers and cows, and histologically, there was evidence of non-suppurative oophoritis with necrosis of granulosa cells and the oocyte in follicles from the infected cows. By contrast only 20 % of the control heifers and cows had evidence of absence of a preovulatory LH surge. These experiments collectively demonstrate that bovine <b>pestivirus</b> <b>infection</b> during the period of final growth of preovulatory follicles may result in varying degrees of necrosis of the granulosa cells with subsequent negative effects on oestradiol- 17 beta secretion which in turn negatively affects the magnitude and/or timing of the preovulatory LH surge.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the context}} of the ongoing {{eradication}} campaign for bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in cattle in Switzerland, the role of South American camelids (SAC) as a possible virus reservoir needed to be evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To assess and characterize the prevalence of <b>pestivirus</b> <b>infections</b> in SAC in Switzerland. ANIMALS: Serum samples collected from 348 animals (40 herds) in 2008 and from 248 animals (39 herds) in 2000 were examined for antibodies against pestiviruses and for the presence of BVDV viral RNA. METHODS: Cross-sectional study using stratified, representative herd sampling. An indirect BVDV-ELISA was used to analyze serum samples for pestivirus antibodies, and positive samples underwent a serum neutralization test (SNT). Real-time RT-PCR to detect pestiviral RNA was carried out in all animals from herds with at least 1 seropositive animal. RESULTS: In 2008, the overall prevalence of animals positive for antibodies (ELISA) and pestiviral RNA or was 5. 75 and 0 %, respectively. In 2000, the corresponding prevalences were 3. 63 and 0 %, respectively. The seroprevalences (SNT) for BVDV, border disease virus or undetermined pestiviruses were estimated to be 0, 1. 73, and 4. 02 % in 2008, and 0. 40, 1. 21, and 2. 02 % in 2000, respectively.

40|$|The {{tripartite}} motif (TRIM) protein family comprises {{more than}} 60 members that have diverse functions in various biological processes. Although {{a small number}} of TRIM proteins have been shown to regulate innate immunity, much remains to be learned about the functions {{of the majority of the}} TRIM proteins. Here we identify TRIM 56 as a cellular protein associated with the N-terminal protease (Npro) of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a pestiviral interferon antagonist which degrades interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF 3) through the proteasome. We found that TRIM 56 was constitutively expressed in most tissues, and its abundance was further upregulated moderately by interferon or virus. The manipulation of TRIM 56 abundance did not affect the protein turnover of Npro and IRF 3. Rather, ectopic expression of TRIM 56 substantially impaired, while knockdown of TRIM 56 expression greatly enhanced, BVDV replication in cell culture. The antiviral activity of TRIM 56 depended on its E 3 ubiquitin ligase activity as well as the integrity of its C-terminal region but was not attributed to a general augmentation of the interferon antiviral response. Overexpression of TRIM 56 did not inhibit the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus or hepatitis C virus, a virus closely related to BVDV. Together, our data demonstrate that TRIM 56 is a novel antiviral host factor that restricts <b>pestivirus</b> <b>infection...</b>|$|R

The reproductive performance of ~ 78, 000 cows managed in 142 breeding mobs located on 72 commercial beef cattle properties was measured over three to four consecutive years (2008 - 11) using a crush-side electronic data capture system. Percentage of lactating cows pregnant within four months of calving, annual pregnancy rate, percentage foetal/calf loss between pregnancy diagnosis and weaning, and annual percentage of pregnant cows missing (mortality) were used to define performance, with the commercially achievable level of performance proposed as the performance of the 75 th percentile mob or cow for each measure. Also, methods of estimating liveweight production from breeding herds were developed, and an achievable level determined for each country type. The impacts of 83 property, environmental, nutritional, management, and infectious disease factors on performance were investigated. The major factors affecting performance included country type, time of previous calving, wet season phosphorous status, cow body condition, hip-height, cow age class, cow reproductive history, severity of environmental conditions, and occurrence of mustering events around the time of calving. Producer/manager opinion that wild dogs were a problem, evidence of recent <b>pestivirus</b> <b>infection</b> and vibriosis were factors that did not contribute to the final model, but did significantly affect animal performance when present.

40|$|Pestiviruses {{express their}} genome {{as a single}} {{polypeptide}} that is subsequently cleaved into individual proteins by host- and virus-encoded proteases. The pestivirus N-terminal protease (N(pro)) is a cysteine autoprotease that cleaves between its own C-terminus and the N-terminus of the core protein. Due to its unique sequence and catalytic site, it forms its own cysteine protease family C 53. After self-cleavage, N(pro) is no longer active as a protease. The released N(pro) suppresses the induction of the host's type-I interferon-α/β (IFN-α/β) response. N(pro) binds interferon regulatory factor- 3 (IRF 3), the key transcriptional activator of IFN-α/β genes, and promotes degradation of IRF 3 by the proteasome, thus preventing induction of the IFN-α/β response to <b>pestivirus</b> <b>infection.</b> Here we report the crystal structures of pestivirus N(pro). N(pro) is structurally distinct from other known cysteine proteases and has a novel "clam shell" fold consisting of a protease domain and a zinc-binding domain. The unique fold of N(pro) allows auto-catalysis at its C-terminus and subsequently conceals the cleavage site in the active site of the protease. Although many viruses interfere with type I IFN induction by targeting the IRF 3 pathway, little information is available regarding structure or mechanism of action of viral proteins that interact with IRF 3. The distribution of amino acids {{on the surface of}} N(pro) involved in targeting IRF 3 for proteasomal degradation provides insight into the nature of N(pro) 's interaction with IRF 3.

NS 3 features two conserved RecA-like domains (D 1 and D 2) with ATPase activity, plus a third domain (D 3) that is important for unwinding nucleic acid duplexes. We report here the X-ray structure of the pestivirus NS 3 helicase domain (pNS 3 h) at a 2. 5 -Å resolution. The structure deviates significantly from that of NS 3 of other genera in the Flaviviridae family in D 3, as it contains two important insertions that result in a narrower nucleic acid binding groove. We also show that mutations in pNS 3 h that rescue viruses from which the core protein is deleted map to D 3, suggesting that this domain {{may be involved in}} interactions that facilitate particle assembly. Finally, structural comparisons of the enzyme in different crystalline environments, together with the findings of small-angle X-ray-scattering studies in solution, show that D 2 is mobile with respect {{to the rest of the}} enzyme, oscillating between closed and open conformations. Binding of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog locks pNS 3 h in a conformation that is more compact than the closest apo-form in our crystals. Together, our results provide new insight and bring up new questions about pNS 3 h function during pestivirus replication. Although <b>pestivirus</b> <b>infections</b> impose an important toll on the livestock industry worldwide, little information is available about the nonstructural proteins essential for viral replication, such as the NS 3 helicase. We provide here a comparative structural and functional analysis of pNS 3 h with respect to its orthologs in other viruses of the same family, the flaviviruses and hepatitis C virus. Our studies reveal differences in the nucleic acid binding groove that could have implications for understanding the unwinding specificity of pNS 3 h, which is active only on RNA duplexes. We also show that pNS 3 h has a highly dynamic behavior [...] a characteristic probably shared with NS 3 helicases from all Flaviviridae members [...] that could be targeted for drug design by using recent algorithms to specifically block molecular motion. Compounds that lock the enzyme in a single conformation or limit its dynamic range of conformations are indeed likely to block its helicase function...|$|R

Antibodies to pestivirus were found in 60 (18, 7 %) sheep, in 21 (6, 5 %) goats, in 8 (10, 8 %) alpacas and in 6 (14 %) llamas. The guanacos and vicunas did not have antibodies to pestivirus. Antibodies to herpesvirus were found in 8 (2, 5 %) sheep and in 62 (19, 3 %) goats. The alpacas, llamas, guanacos and vicunas did not antibodies to herpesvirus. From the seropositive animals to pestivirus, the sheep flocks were located in the Metropolitan Region and XII Region of Chile with 7, 1 % to 82, 1 % positive serum samples, with titres between I I to 1024, and 5 (22, 7 %) positive flocks; The goat flocks were located in the W Region and the Metropolitan Region with 6, 7 % to 100 % positive serum samples, with titers between 4 to 512, and 3 (13, 6 %) positive flocks. The alpacas and llamas flocks were located in the Metropolitan Region (where they live with other ruminants). Alpacas 10, 8 % serum samples from 2 flocks and 14 % serum sample of llamas from I flock, were positive, with titers between 32 to 2048. From the seropositive animals to herpesvirus, only one sheep flock was positive and it was located in VI Region of Chile with 28, 6 % positive serum samples, with titers between 2 to 5, 6; The goat flocks positive to herpesvirus were located in the IV Region and the Metropolitan Region with 4, 2 % to 66, 7 % positive serum samples, with titers between 2 to 45, and 14 (63, 6 %) positive flocks. The serum samples from guanacos and vicunas were obtained from their natural Regions, guanacos from the IV and XII Regions and vicunas. from the I Region. The findings of our study confirm that <b>pestivirus</b> <b>infections</b> of sheep, goats, alpacas and llamas and herpesvirus infections of sheep and goats occur in Chile.

40|$|The pestiviruses bovine viral {{diarrhoea}} viruses (BVDV), classical {{swine fever}} (CSFV) and border disease virus (BDV) are important pathogens for livestock. These viruses are worldwide responsible for significant economic losses. Infection of cattle with BVDV causes a spectrum of clinical signs, ranging from asymptomatic to severe disease potentially leading to death. The major losses due to BVDV infection include growth retardation and reduced milk production. BVDV crosses the placenta and infects the foetus, resulting, in persistently infected (PI) animals. PI animals continuously shed massive amount of virus during their life-time and serve as the reservoir of the virus in cattle herds. BVDV is endemic in bovine populations worldwide. In the last decades programs have been implemented to eliminate PI animals. The classic symptoms caused by infection with the CSFV in pigs are pyrexia, severe leucopoenia, haemorrhages and neurologic problems. This results in high morbidity and mortality. CSFV has been eradicated {{in parts of the}} world, i. e. the US, the EU and Australia, but it is still endemic in many other regions such as for example in Eastern European countries, Asia and South America. Vaccination and stamping out have been used for the control of CSFV. Since the control of CSFV in endemic regions remains problematic and since reintroduction of CSFV in virus-free regions results in a serious burden, new control measures for CSFV are needed. Moreover, given the enormous economic impact of BVDV, additional measures are needed for the control of this virus. Highly potent antiviral drugs may be an excellent tool to help control <b>pestivirus</b> <b>infection.</b> Efficient antiviral drugs have the benefit to result almost instantaneously in a protective effect (in contrast to vaccines where there is an immunity gap between vaccination and protection) and they may, in the case of CSFV control, be useful to close the immunity gap. Rapid control of outbreaks with CSFV will largely reduce the number of healthy animals that will need to be culled in the containment perimeter around the infected premises and help to minimize disruption of trade and thus to decrease the economic impact of the disease. Eliminating PI animals without prophylactic antivirals or vaccination of non-infected animals on a farm where a PI calf has been identified is currently regarded as an important control measure. In the last 10 to 15 years, our laboratory and others, identified different chemical classes of pestivirus inhibitors. The effect of two compounds (DB 772 and BPIP) has been assessed in infected animals, DB 772 in BVDV infected mini-zebu cows and the imidazopyridine BPIP (a compound discovered in our laboratory) in CSFV infected pigs. BPIP was shown to be effective in reducing viral load in infected pigs and to reduce transmission to sentinels. This provided the first proof-of-concept that a specific antiviral therapy has indeed great potential for the control of <b>pestivirus</b> <b>infections</b> in livestock. In a large scale screening effort aimed at identifying novel pestivirus inhibitors, we discovered several classes of potent and selective inhibitors of the in vitro replication of pestiviruses. To further optimize the antiviral activity hit-optimization programs were initiated for three different classes [2, 6 -bis(benzimidazol- 2 -yl) pyridine, BBP/CSFA- 0; imidazolidine, BTB 02541 SC/CSFB- 0; Quinolinecarboxamides, TO 502 - 2403 /CSFC- 00 and TO 505 - 6180 /CSFC- 0]. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) was carefully studied for these three chemical classes in an attempt to further improve the antiviral activity and selectivity. In parallel, the particular characteristics and mechanism of action of these (and yet some other) classes of compounds was studied. To this end, it was first attempted to select drug-resistant variants; which were next genotyped to identify in which gene (a) mutation(s) were accumulating. Surprisingly, for all classes of pestivirus inhibitors studied, the resistance-conferring mutations were located in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Moreover, the structurally very different classes of compounds proved all to be cross-resistant to each other as well as to earlier reported classes of pestivirus inhibitors (BPIP, AG 110 and LZ 37). All mutations identified were located in the fingertip of the RdRp. Remarkably, none of these compounds inhibited the activity of the purified BVDV RdRp but efficiently blocked the activity of viral replication complexes. Thus the different classes of pestivirus inhibitors all target a hotspot in the viral polymerase thereby inhibiting the functioning of the replication complex of which the RdRp is a component. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that this hotspot in the finger domain of the pestivirus RdRp is likely, and this {{in stark contrast to the}} situation for the related hepatitis virus, the only allosteric pocket in the polymerase. Inhibitors that bind to this pocket prevent the proper functioning of the RdRp (or interaction with other proteins or RNA) in the context of the viral replication complex. The findings reported in this thesis will contribute to the further development of additional control measures for pestiviral infections in livestock. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Bovine viral {{diarrhea}} virus (BVDV) is {{the prototype}} <b>Pestivirus.</b> BVDV <b>infection</b> is distributed worldwide and causes serious {{problems for the}} livestock industry. The thiosemicarbazone of 5, 6 -dimethoxy- 1 -indanone (TSC) is a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor (NNI) of BVDV. All TSC-resistant BVDV variants (BVDV-TSCr T 1 – 5) present an N 264 D mutation in the NS 5 B gene (RdRp) whereas the variant BVDV-TSCr T 1 also presents an NS 5 B A 392 E mutation. In the present study, we carried out twenty passages of BVDV-TSCr T 1 – 5 in MDBK cells {{in the absence of}} TSC to evaluate the stability of the resistance. The viral populations obtained (BVDV R 1 – 5) remained resistant to the antiviral compound and conserved the mutations in NS 5 B associated with this phenotype. Along the passages, BVDV R 2, R 3 and R 5 presented a delay in the production of cytopathic effect that correlated with a decrease in cell apoptosis and intracellular accumulation of viral RNA. The complete genome sequences that encode for NS 2 to NS 5 B, Npro and Erns were analyzed. Additional mutations were detected in the NS 5 B of BVDV R 1, R 3 and R 4. In both BVDV R 2 and R 3, most of the mutations found were localized in NS 5 A, whereas in BVDV R 5, the only mutation fixed was NS 5 A V 177 A. These results suggest that mutations in NS 5 A could alter BVDV cytopathogenicity. In conclusion, the stability of the resistance to TSC {{may be due to the}} fixation of different compensatory mutations in each BVDV-TSCr. During their replication in a TSC-free medium, some virus populations presented a kind of interaction with the host cell that resembled a persistent infection: decreased cytopathogenicity and viral genome synthesis.

40|$|We {{report on}} the highly potent and {{selective}} antipestivirus activity of 5 -[(4 -bromophenyl) methyl]- 2 -phenyl- 5 H-imidazo[4, 5 -c]pyridine (BPIP). The 50 % effective concentration (EC 50) for inhibition of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) -induced cytopathic effect formation was 0. 04 +/- 0. 01 microM. Comparable reduction of viral RNA synthesis (EC 50 = 0. 12 +/- 0. 02 microM) and production of infectious virus (EC 50 = 0. 074 +/- 0. 003 microM) were observed. The selectivity index (ratio of 50 % cytostatic concentration/EC 50) of BPIP was approximately 2, 000. BPIP was inactive against the hepatitis C virus subgenomic replicon and yellow fever virus but demonstrated weak activity against GB virus. Drug-resistant mutants were at least 300 -fold less susceptible to BPIP than wild-type virus; showed cross-resistance to N-propyl-N-[2 -(2 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazino[5, 6 -b]indol- 3 -ylthio) ethyl]- 1 -propanamine (VP 32947), and carried the F 224 S mutation in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). When the F 224 S mutation was introduced into an infectious clone, the drug-resistant phenotype was obtained. BPIP did not inhibit the in vitro activity of recombinant BVDV RdRp, but did inhibit the activity of replication complexes (RCs). Computational docking revealed that F 224 {{is located at the}} top of the finger domain of the polymerase. Docking of BPIP in the crystal structure of the BVDV RdRp revealed aromatic ring stacking, some hydrophobic contacts, and a hydrogen bond. Since two structurally unrelated compounds, i. e., BPIP and VP 32947, target the same region of the BVDV RdRp, this position may be expected to be critical in the functioning of the polymerase or assembly of the RC. The potential of BPIP for the treatment of <b>pestivirus</b> and hepacivirus <b>infections</b> is discussed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Although {{transplacental}} virus infections {{account for}} considerable {{morbidity and mortality}} in both animals and humans, very little is so far known about the pathways whereby virus reaches the conceptus, the subsequent virus-host interactions in the early phases of the infections, {{and the establishment of}} persistent non-lethal infection. Using a natural animal model we recently demonstrated that bovine pestivirus can spread from the site of infection to the ovine fetus within 72 h, despite the expression of interferon in the reproductive tract [1]. In the present study we demonstrate that <b>pestivirus</b> first establishes <b>infection</b> and spread within the allantoic and amniotic membranes and then the fetus, followed several days later by infection of the uterine glands. However, virus replication and spread within the fetus is, at least in part, controlled by fetal developmental factors. In fetuses less than 25 days of gestational age, the virus remains restricted to the bulbis cordis, the first brachial pouch and occasionally the aorta. Over the next few days the virus spreads to multiple tissues, in addition to becoming more widespread and pronounced within the initially infected tissues. A potential role for the binucleated cells of the allantochorion in the spread of the virus from the fetal to the maternal tissues was also found. These cells expressed high levels of viral antigen just prior to and during the time period in which virus antigen became detectable in the epithelial cells of the uterine glands, in endothelial cells of uterine vessels and in scattered macrophage-like cells in the uterine stroma. Most likely this relatively late virus transfer is inconsequential for the mother, since it occurs at a time when a maternal virus-specific antibody response is becoming measurable. This is in contrast to the fetus, where the infection will have established itself widely prior to the development of lymphoid tissues and a functional immune response, thus setting the scenario for development of specific tolerance to the persisting virus.
