30|$|The {{experimental}} design was a randomized, blinded, controlled, parallel-group study. The animals were treated {{in accordance with}} recommendations from the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Use of Animals in Research and were approved by the University Animal Care and Use Committee. Sexually mature female Sprague–Dawley rats, aged 6 – 8  weeks and weighing 240 – 300  g, were housed {{for a minimum of}} 1  week before surgery. The animals were maintained under standard laboratory conditions (temperature 20 – 22 °C, relative humidity 50 – 70 %, 12 : 12  h light/dark ratio) and were fed a standard laboratory diet and had free access to food and water before and after the operative procedures. In the event of a rat dying before the second operative procedure, the rat was replaced for laparoscopy {{in order to maintain the}} same number of rats in each group. Before each procedure, all instruments were sterilized by rubbing with 70 % isopropanol. On the day of the surgery, each rat was anesthetized with a single intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital at 0.08  mg/g (Nembutal, Sanofi Santé Animale, Brussels, Belgium) and was branded (metallic clip on ear and color marking on tail). Rats were placed in dorsal recumbent position, abdominal <b>operative</b> <b>surface</b> was shaved (electric shaver), and disinfection of the abdominal <b>operative</b> <b>surface</b> was carried out with dermic polyvidone (Viatris, Mérignac, France).|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 191 - 216) Surface sediment transport, the grav 1 ty induced downslope {{movement of}} the surficial veneer of soil material, is a significant denudational activity in southern California watersheds. A review is presented summarizing the current knowledge of the pertinent processes, mechanics, controls, and effects of hillslope denudation. A thirteen month field study using 30 cm aperture collection troughs analyzed the influence of slope aspect, hillside steepness, and Vegetation type on the distribution {{in space and time}} of surface sediment transport in the San Dimas Experimental Forest. Results indicate that, despite extremely variable data, vegetation type is a highly significant factor in controlling total surface sediment transport while slope aspect signiticantly affects the spatial distribution of mineral matter movement. Hillside steepness and vegetation type affect the temporal distribution of mineral debris production. An analysis of rainfall and wind travel data indicates that surface sediment transport is more closely related to blowing wind than to falling rain. There is no apparent difference in surface transport between upslope and downslope plots with identical site characteristics. Recovery patterns of colored tracer particles reinforce the disparity in spatial debris production figures from plots with ditferent vegetation assemblages. These results lead {{to the conclusion that the}} entire surface veneer of the slope mantle is moving together as a quasi-continuous mass by sequential downslope sediment l transport. The manners of action of the <b>operative</b> <b>surface</b> processes coupled with the field data suggest that declining retreat is the most probable mode of slope development within the San Dimas Experimental Forest...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPulmonary {{surfactant}} is {{an essential}} lipid–protein complex to maintain an <b>operative</b> respiratory <b>surface</b> at the mammalian lungs. It reduces surface tension at the alveolar air–liquid interface to stabilise the lungs against physical forces operating along the compression–expansion breathing cycles. At the same time, surfactant integrates elements establishing a primary barrier against the entry of pathogens. Lack or deficiencies of the surfactant system are associated with respiratory pathologies, which treatment often includes supplementation with exogenous materials. The present review summarises current models on the molecular mechanisms of surfactant function, with particular emphasis in its biophysical properties to stabilise the lungs and the molecular alterations connecting impaired surfactant with diseased organs. It also provides a perspective on the current surfactant-based strategies to treat respiratory pathologies.

The accuracy of performing unicondylar knee replacement using a freehand sculpting, semi active robotic tool was investigated using twenty synthetic femur and tibia. The resultant cut surface was compared to the intra <b>operative</b> planned <b>surface.</b> Resultant femoral and tibial implant placement was compared to the planned implant position. The maximum overcut or undercut was 2. 5 mm. The mean femoral and tibial surfaces showed a slight undercut (0. 14 mm and 0. 20 mm). The maximum rotational error was 3. 2 o and RMS angular error was 1. 46 o across all orientations. The maximum translational error was 1. 18 mm and the RMS translational error across all directions was 0. 61 mm.

Immunoglobulin from both normal T cells and ATC was cytophilic for macrophages (peritoneal exudate cells), but showed no detectable capacity to bind to either T lymphocytes or to bone marrow derived lymphocytes (B cells). Under the <b>operative</b> experimental conditions, <b>surface</b> immunoglobulin of B cells did not show appreciable binding to macrophages.

40|$|The purpose: an {{approbation}} of intraoperative photodynamic {{identification of}} healthy and adenomatous parathyroid glands using 5 -aminolevulinic acid (5 -ALA) at thyroid and parathyroid operations. Materials and methods: intraoperative photodynamic identification using 5 -ALA {{was performed in}} 25 patients with various thyroid and parathyroid diseases. 2 – 3 hours before the surgery the patients have received 1, 5 g of 5 -ALA per os. In 10 cases video-assisted operations were performed. In 3 cases at primary hyperparathyroidism video-assisted parathyroidectomy was used. In other cases the operative intervention was carried out using conventional technique. The <b>operative</b> wound <b>surface</b> was exposed to blue light of the light source KARL STORZ D-Light C (wavelength – 380 – 440 nm) and the endoscope with the system of filters. During preand postoperative period we have been registering basic clinical parameters, including parathyroid hormone level {{and the level of}} ionized calcium monitoring before operation, in 24, 48 hours and 1 month after operation. Results: the parathyroid glands were identified in 23 of 25 patients. There were no cases of allergic reactions and other side effects of 5 -ALA introduction. Conclusion: intraoperative parathyroid glands identification by the way of registration of their fluorescence at peroral administration of 5 -aminolevulinic acid is possible for the overwhelming majority of patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of radiant heating systems (floor heating, ceiling panels) is relatively well documented. Water based systems, where pipes {{are embedded in}} the building structure, are now being increasingly used for cooling purposes. Several theoretical studies based {{on the use of}} computer simulations have been published, but very little is reported on the actual performance in existing buildings. There are still uncertainties on how such systems operate and on how well the space temperatures under varying external and internal load is kept within the comfort range. To study this aspect, field measurements of thermal comfort conditions were made in several buildings with radiant surface cooling systems. The systems comprise floor cooling, wall cooling and cooling with pipes embedded in the concrete slabs between each floor in a multi storey building. Long term measurements of <b>operative,</b> air, <b>surface,</b> system and external temperatures have been carried out. The analysis of the data shows that, for the major part of the time of occupancy, the operative temperature is inside the comfort range. The analysis has been lead for different classes of comfort according to existing standards. The data show an increase in space temperature during the day, which is counterbalanced by a corresponding decrease during the night. This study shows that hydronic radiant cooling systems in many buildings are an interesting alternative to full air conditioning systems, for obtaining acceptable indoor thermal environments during summer. 1...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{mechanisms}} that yield {{the growth of}} homochiral copolymers over their heterochiral counterparts have been advocated by Lahav and co-workers. These chiral amplification mechanisms proceed through racemic β-sheet-controlled polymerization <b>operative</b> in both <b>surface</b> crystallites {{as well as in}} solution. We develop two complementary theoretical models for these template-induced desymmetrization processes leading to multicomponent homochiral copolymers. First, assuming reversible β-sheet formation, the equilibrium between the free monomer pool and the polymer strand within the template is assumed. This yields coupled nonlinear mass balance equations whose solutions are used to calculate enantiomeric excesses and average lengths of the homochiral chains formed. The second approach is a probabilistic treatment based on random polymerization. The occlusion probabilities depend on the polymerization activation energies for each monomer species and are proportional to the concentrations of the monomers in solution in the constant pool approximation. The monomer occlusion probabilities are represented geometrically in terms of unit simplexes from which conditions for maximizing or minimizing the likelihood for mirror symmetry breaking can be determined...|$|R
40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} {{that the combination of}} a wet-chemically grown SiO 2 tunnel oxide with a highly-doped microcrystalline silicon carbide layer grown by hot-wire chemical vapor deposition yields an excellent surface passivation for phosphorous-doped crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers. We find effective minority carrier lifetimes of well above 6 ms by introducing this stack. We investigated its c-Si surface passivation mechanism in a systematic study combined with the comparison to a phosphorous-doped polycrystalline-Si (pc-Si) /SiO 2 stack. In both cases, field effect passivation by the n-doping of either the µc-SiC:H or the pc-Si is effective. Hydrogen passivation during µc-SiC:H growth plays an important role for the µc-SiC:H/SiO 2 combination, whereas phosphorous in-diffusion into the SiO 2 and the c-Si is <b>operative</b> for the <b>surface</b> passivation via the Pc-Si/SiO 2 stack. The high transparency and conductivity of the µc-SiC:H layer, a low thermal budget and number of processes needed to form the stack, and the excellent c-Si surface passivation quality are advantageous features of µc-SiC:H/SiO 2 that can be beneficial for c-Si solar cells...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} {{investigated}} the kinetic and interfacial properties of two secreted phospholipases isolated from Tunisian vipers'venoms: Cerastes cerastes (CC-PLA 2) and Macrovipera lebetina transmediterranea (MVL-PLA 2). Results show that these enzymes have great different abilities to bind and hydrolyse phospholipids. Using egg-yolk emulsions as substrate at pH 8, we found that MVL-PLA 2 has a specific activity of 1473 U/mg at 37 degrees C in presence of 1 mM CaCl 2. Furthermore the interfacial kinetic and binding data indicate that MVL-PLA 2 has a preference to the zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine monolayers (PC). Conversely, CC-PLA 2 {{was found to be}} able to hydrolyse preferentially negatively charged head group phospholipids (PG and PS) and exhibits a specific activity 9 times more important (13 333 U/mg at 60 degrees C in presence of 3 mM CaCl 2). Molecular models of both CC-PLA 2 and MVL-PLA 2 3 D structures have been built and their electrostatic potentials surfaces have been calculated. A marked anisotropy of the overall electrostatic charge distribution leads to a significantly difference in the dipole moment intensity between the two enzymes explaining the great differences in catalytic and binding properties, which seems to be governed by the electrostatic and hydrophobic forces <b>operative</b> at the <b>surface</b> of the two phospholipase...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} to transfer protons between surface groups is an innate property of many proteins. The transfer of a proton between donor and acceptor, located {{as far as}} 6 − 7 Å apart, necessitates the participation of water molecules in the process. In a previous study we investigated the mechanism of proton transfer (PT) between bulk exposed sites, a few ångströms apart, using as a model the proton exchange between the proton-binding sites of the fluorescein molecule in dilute aqueous solution. 1 The present study expands the understanding of PT reactions between adjacent sites exposed to water through the calculation the minimum energy pathways (MEPs) by the conjugate peak refinement algorithm 2 and a quantum-mechanical potential. The PT reaction trajectories were calculated for the fluorescein system with {{an increasing number of}} water molecules. The MEP calculations reveal that the transition state is highly strained and involves a supramolecular structure in which fluorescein and the interconnecting water molecules are covalently bonded together and the protons are shared between neighboring oxygens. These findings are in accord with the high activation energy, as measured for the reaction, and indicate that PT reactions on the surface proceed by a semi- or fully concerted rather than stepwise mechanism. A similar mechanism is assumed to be <b>operative</b> on the <b>surface</b> of proteins and renders water-mediated PT reactions as highly efficient as they are...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe DREAMS (Dust characterization, Risk {{assessment}} and Environment Analyser on the Martian Surface) experiment on Schiaparelli lander of ExoMars 2016 mission was an autonomous meteorological station designed to completely characterize the Martian atmosphere on surface, acquiring data {{not only on}} temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed and direction, but also on solar irradiance, dust opacity and atmospheric electrification, to measure {{for the first time}} key parameters linked to hazard conditions for future manned explorations. Although with very limited mass and energy resources, DREAMS would be able to operate autonomously for at least two Martian days (sols) after landing in a very harsh environment as it was supposed to land on Mars during the dust storm season (October 2016 in Meridiani Planum) relying on its own power supply. ExoMars mission was successfully launched on 14 th March 2016 and Schiaparelli entered the Mars atmosphere on October 20 th beginning its ‘six minutes of terror’ journey to the surface. Unfortunately, some unexpected behavior during the parachuted descent caused an unrecoverable critical condition in navigation system of the lander driving to a destructive crash on the surface. The adverse sequence of events at 4 km altitude triggered the transition of the lander in <b>surface</b> <b>operative</b> mode, commanding switch on the DREAMS instrument, which was therefore able to correctly power on and send back housekeeping data. This proved the nominal performance of all DREAMS hardware before touchdown demonstrating the highest TRL of the unit for future missions.

40|$|Surface x-ray {{scattering}} {{has been used}} to determine the structure of Tl adlayers on the Au(111) electrode surface during the course of 0 {sub 2 } reduction. 0. reduction is considerably catalyzed by Ti adlayers on Au(111). The half-wave potential is shifted to more positive values {{in the presence of the}} Ti adlayer. In both, acid and alkaline solutions TI causes a change in the reaction mechanism from a 2 -ereduction to a 4 e-reduction in a limited potential range. The in-plane X-ray diffraction measurements revealed that the close-packed rotated-hexagonal Ti phase, which exists in the potential range between - 0. 4 V and the bulk TI deposition at {approx}{minus} 0. 7 V, has a lower activity for 0. reduction than the low-coverage phases in both solutions. It supports a 2 e-reduction. 0 {sub 2 } reduction does not change the TI coverage in this phase but causes a significant decrease of the in-plane diffracted intensity. The lower coverage phases which exist at more positive potentials, viz., aligned hexagonal in alkaline solution and patches of the (2 {times} 2) TI phase in acid solution, are conducive to a 4 e-reduction. The diffraction intensity from these two phases, however, vanishes quickly during O{sub 2 } reduction. It appears that the TI coverage remains on the surface unchanged. These observations indicate that the O{sub 2 } molecules interact directly with the Tl adatoms prior to the charge transfer. This provides the most direct evidence that the outer sphere charge transfer mechanism in 0 {sub 2 } reduction is not <b>operative</b> for some <b>surfaces.</b> H{sub 2 } 0 {sub 2 } reduction is facile on the surface covered with the low-coverage TI phases, while it is almost completely suppressed by the rotated-hexagonal phase...|$|R
40|$|Qualification of {{microsystems}} for weapon applications {{is critically}} dependent on {{our ability to}} build confidence in their performance, by predicting the evolution of their behavior over time in the stockpile. The objective of this work was to accelerate aging mechanisms <b>operative</b> in <b>surface</b> micromachined silicon microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) with contacting surfaces that are stored for many years prior to use, {{to determine the effects}} of aging on reliability, and relate those effects to changes in the behavior of interfaces. Hence the main focus was on 'dormant' storage effects on the reliability of devices having mechanical contacts, the first time they must move. A large number ({approx} 1000) of modules containing prototype devices and diagnostic structures were packaged using the best available processes for simple electromechanical devices. The packaging processes evolved during the project to better protect surfaces from exposure to contaminants and water vapor. Packages were subjected to accelerated aging and stress tests to explore dormancy and operational environment effects on reliability and performance. Functional tests and quantitative measurements of adhesion and friction demonstrated that the main failure mechanism during dormant storage is change in adhesion and friction, precipitated by loss of the fluorinated monolayer applied after fabrication. The data indicate that damage to the monolayer can occur at water vapor concentrations as low as 500 ppm inside the package. The most common type of failure was attributed to surfaces that were in direct contact during aging. The application of quantitative methods for monolayer lubricant analysis showed that even though the coverage of vapor-deposited monolayers is generally very uniform, even on hidden surfaces, locations of intimate contact can be significantly depleted in initial concentration of lubricating molecules. These areas represent defects in the film prone to adsorption of water or contaminants that can cause movable structures to adhere. These analysis methods also indicated significant variability in the coverage of lubricating molecules from one coating process to another, even for identical processing conditions. The variability was due to residual molecules left in the deposition chamber after incomplete cleaning. The coating process was modified to result in improved uniformity and total coverage. Still, a direct correlation was found between the resulting static friction behavior of MEMS interfaces, and the absolute monolayer coverage. While experimental results indicated that many devices would fail to start after aging, the modeling approach used here predicted that all the devices should start. Adhesion modeling based upon values of adhesion energy from cantilever beams is therefore inadequate. Material deposition that bridged gaps was observed in some devices, and potentially inhibits start-up more than the adhesion model indicates. Advances were made in our ability to model MEMS devices, but additional combined experimental-modeling studies will be needed to advance the work to a point of providing predictive capability. The methodology developed here should prove useful in future assessments of device aging, however. Namely, it consisted of measuring interface properties, determining how they change with time, developing a model of device behavior incorporating interface behavior, and then using the age-aware interface behavior model to predict device function...|$|R
40|$|The surface {{temperature}} of radiant {{systems can be}} significantly different than the temperature of other room surfaces. Therefore, radiation heat exchange often becomes the dominant mode of heat transfer. To accurately predict the {{surface temperature}} of radiant systems, it becomes necessary to model radiative heat fluxes in detail, in order to evaluate the thermal environment in terms of energy and comfort. In this study, a detailed thermal simulation module was developed for prediction of transient heat flux and surface temperatures in rooms with radiant floor heating, {{taking into account the}} impact of solar radiation on exposed thermal mass. The studied system consists of a room with a south facing window and a concrete floor with embedded tubing, located in Indianapolis, IN. Emphasis is placed on the radiation exchange module, which employs the full radiosity method, variable solar gains, and tracking of window projections on floors which are treated as separate surfaces in an 8 -surface enclosure. For the thermal analysis, the heat balance method is used to build a comprehensive thermal network and solved explicitly using a finite difference approach to calculate surface temperatures and quantify thermal comfort. Comparison with simplified methods (linearized and constant radiation coefficients and absence of absorbed solar gains) and with other software is also presented in detail. ^ The dynamic simulation module is used to investigate different modes of dynamic control of the radiant system in order to satisfy the space heating load and maintain thermal comfort. Specifically, a proportional-integral and a predictive control algorithm were utilized and compared, having operative temperature as the controlled variable. The impact of control constants and time step selection are discussed and analyzed in order to achieve the best possible results. The results show that (i) without considering the impact of absorbed solar radiation, the simplified models underestimate the higher limits of <b>operative</b> and floor <b>surface</b> temperatures by up to 3. 5 degrees Celsius compared to the advanced developed module; (ii) taking into account the sunlit dynamic projections on the floor, simplified models with optimized proportional integral control of the system predict that the operative temperature remains below the lower comfort limit for 2. 65 % of the time and above the higher comfort limit for 6. 3 % of the time. Using the advanced module and same control parameters, these values changed to 2. 8 % and 26. 0 % respectively, while temperature differences in floor surface temperatures reach 2. 8 degrees Celsius. Combining the developed model with hourly or sub-hourly weather data may lead to more accurate prediction of the annual dynamic thermal response spaces with radiant floor systems and exposed thermal mass, better understanding of control guidelines, and further insight to the impact different radiation heat transfer models have on the heating energy consumption of radiant type systems. ...|$|R
