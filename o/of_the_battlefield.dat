5|$|On the {{northern}} end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield,</b> events had unfolded quite differently. Dampierre's cavalry routed Lannoy's company of light horse; the Italians and the contingent from Gruyères, meanwhile, broke and fled—leaving their officers to be killed—without offering any real resistance to the advancing Imperial infantry. As Cardona's infantry moved past the original French line, Enghien descended on it with the entire body of heavy cavalry under his command; the subsequent engagement {{took place on the}} reverse slope of the ridge, {{out of sight of the}} rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield.</b>|$|E

5|$|Union {{infantry}} attacked {{from the}} east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield,</b> {{while most of the}} cavalry attacked from the south and west. Capehart's brigade attacked from the southwest, and eventually was on the extreme western side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield.</b> At times, the cavalry fought dismounted, with their horses led at a safe distance behind. The opposing forces were always within range of the Union cavalry carbines, keeping the weapon's seven-shot advantage—and not enabling the Confederate infantry to utilize the advantage of their longer range weapons.|$|E
5|$|Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> is now {{preserved}} in Princeton Battlefield State Park, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Another section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> {{adjacent to the}} state park is embroiled in a development controversy. The Institute for Advanced Study, which owns the property, is planning a housing project on land where George Washington charged with his men during the battle. Historians, the Department of the Interior and archaeological evidence confirm the land's significance. Several national and local preservation organizations are working to prevent construction on the property, and the Princeton Battlefield Society had legal action pending as of summer 2016. On December 12, 2016, the Civil War Trust announced they will purchase almost 15 acres of land from the Institute for Advanced Study. Seven of the planned single family dwellings will be replaced with townhouses. In total, 16 housing units will be constructed. The compromise is subject to approval by the Princeton Planning Board and Delaware and Raritan Canal Commission.|$|E

5|$|In September 1918, Shanks was {{appointed}} commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 16th Division at Camp Kearny, California, and Chamberlin {{was appointed}} the division's Assistant Chief of Staff.

5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} men in {{leadership}} positions {{were likely to be}} wounded or killed, soldiers learned the jobs of those beside and above them. At the British First Army headquarters, a large-scale plasticine model of the Vimy sector was constructed and used to show commissioned and senior non-commissioned officers the topographical features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> and details of the German trench system. In addition, upwards of 40,000 topographical trench maps were printed and distributed to ensure that even platoon sergeants and section commanders possessed a wider awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield.</b> These measures gave each platoon a clearer picture of how it fitted into the greater battle plan and in so doing, reduced the command and control problems that plagued First World War combat.|$|E
5|$|The Stanleys were {{positioned}} {{on the south}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield,</b> on rising ground towards Stoke Golding and Dadlington. The Earl of Oxford turned north to avoid the marsh (and possibly Richard's guns). This manoeuvre put the marsh on Oxford's right. He moved to attack Norfolk's vanguard. Norfolk was subsequently killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{environment}} {{must be used}} to the player's advantage {{more often}} as the game progresses. The first two battles take place on simple, large, flat areas of land, with the only goal being to discover how to scale the colossi and attack their weak points. However, {{the majority of the}} following fourteen battles require that some aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> be used.|$|E
50|$|Because {{there were}} no radios or {{televisions}} that reported <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefields,</b> Americans had a romantic view of war. Not only were many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs patriotic, {{but they were also}} romantic. These songs portrayed soldiers as brave and noble, while the women were portrayed as fragile and loyal as they waited for their loved ones.|$|R
50|$|Evans was {{the first}} female and {{youngest}} Trustee and Director <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Battlefields</b> Trust - campaigning both locally and nationally to defend battlefields from inappropriate development or even destruction.

Evans also co-ordinated the social media for the No Casino Gettysburg, which helped gain a victory in <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> preservation campaign preventing <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> a casino upon hallowed ground on <b>the</b> famous historical <b>battlefield</b> <b>of</b> Gettysburg, where President Abraham Lincoln also made his famous speech - The Gettysburg Address.|$|R
25|$|The area's Civil War battles are commemorated in Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park. Formed by {{an act of}} Congress in 1927, the {{national}} military park preserves portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefields</b> <b>of</b> Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, <b>the</b> Wilderness, and Spotsylvania Court House. The Fredericksburg National Cemetery, also part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park, was developed by the federal government after the war on Marye's Heights on <b>the</b> Fredericksburg <b>battlefield.</b> It contains more than 15,000 Union burials from <b>the</b> area's <b>battlefields.</b> Many unidentified soldiers were buried in mass graves.|$|R

5|$|At {{approximately}} {{the same time as}} Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, rallied elements of D'Erlon's I Corps, spearheaded by the 13th Légère, renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte and this time were successful, partly because the King's German Legion's ammunition ran out. However, the Germans had held the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> for almost the entire day, and this had stalled the French advance.|$|E
5|$|Birks took {{classes at}} the Australian 1st Division school in France, and was {{commissioned}} as a second lieutenant in the 6th Battalion on 4 May 1917. He had served with the battalion earlier while a stretcher bearer, and began serving as an infantryman at Passchendaele. Passchendaele was characterised by the mud <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield,</b> and has been widely used {{as an example of}} attrition warfare—both the Commonwealth and German forces were suffering heavy casualties. When the Fifth Army was failing to make any appreciable headway, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig put General Herbert Plumer in command of the offensive.|$|E

5|$|In early 1992, the Independent Škabrnja Battalion {{became the}} 1st Battalion of the 159th Infantry Brigade. Control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> changed {{slightly}} {{during the night}} of 22–23 May 1992, when Croatian forces captured Križ Hill (near Bibinje, southeast of Zadar); this improved security along the Adriatic Highway. Another change took place in JanuaryFebruary 1993, when Croatian troops recaptured part of the Zadar hinterland in Operation Maslenica. The rest of the region was recaptured by Croatia during Operation Storm in August 1995.|$|E
5|$|In the Ramayana, Trijata {{appears as}} a wise old rakshasi, who dreams of Ravana's {{destruction}} and Rama's victory. She accompanies Sita on a survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> of the war between Rama and Ravana, and reassures Sita of Rama's well-being when Sita sees her husband unconscious and presumes him dead. In later Ramayana adaptations, Trijata becomes the daughter of Vibhishana, the brother of Ravana who sides with Rama. She plays a much greater role in later versions, especially Southeast Asian ones.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after dawn, Reshef {{conducted}} a reconnaissance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> from a hilltop.

The infantry were from the 16th Brigade's right-flank battalion and had the support of recoilless rifles, RPG-7s, and some manually guided AT-3 Sagger missiles. Reshef discovered that the Egyptians had mined both sides of Lexicon Road, to which he had lost several of his tanks.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{began at}} about 8 a.m. {{with the first}} allied lines attacking the village of Telnitz, which was defended by the 3rd Line Regiment. This sector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>battlefield</b> {{witnessed}} heavy fighting in this early action as several ferocious Allied charges evicted the French from the town and forced them onto {{the other side of}} the Goldbach. The first men of Davout's corps arrived at this time and threw the Allies out of Telnitz before they too were attacked by hussars and re-abandoned the town. Additional Allied attacks out of Telnitz were checked by French artillery.|$|E
