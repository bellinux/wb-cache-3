40|$|The {{performance}} of heavy mobile equipment {{used in the}} mining industry is often restricted by the capabilities of their tires. These off-the-road tires experience highly variable and complex working conditions in comparison to other commercially used tires. As a result, expenditures on tires occupy a reasonable portion of the total mining cost and off-the-road tires are prone to complex failure modes, which the studies have been limited. Lack of quantitative analysis on the performance characteristics of these tires hinders the overall productivity in mining industry, specially in local context. The paper presents a study on <b>off-the-road</b> <b>tire</b> performance conducted at two selected mine sites in Sri Lanka. Site specific operational and environmental conditions encountered by the off-the-roads tires were taken into account, to determine the modes of failure and optimum tire performance through best practices...|$|E

50|$|<b>Off-the-road</b> (OTR) <b>tires</b> are {{generally}} larger, {{for use on}} heavy equipment that would not normally operate on paved roads. On July 31, 2012 Kal Tire partnered with OTR Tyres in the UK to create a global earthmover tire sales and service company.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, {{the firm}} brought {{antidumping}} and countervailing duty cases on imports of <b>off-the-road</b> <b>tires</b> from China {{on behalf of}} the domestic industry. The case {{was one of the first}} to counteract Chinese government subsidies benefitting U.S. imports. The firm went on to defend the duties against challenge at the World Trade Organization and in the U.S. courts. The court challenge became the lead case on the issue of whether or not Chinese subsidies can be remedied by the imposition of countervailing duties. The case ultimately led to the passage of legislation by Congress in 2012 clarifying that such duties may be legally imposed. Stewart and Stewart defended the constitutionality of that legislation in court and a decision in favor of the new law was issued in early 2013. Further appeals are possible.|$|R

50|$|Heavy {{equipment}} requires specialized tires {{for various}} construction applications. While {{many types of}} equipment have continuous tracks applicable to more severe service requirements, tires are used where greater speed or mobility is required. An understanding of what equipment {{will be used for}} during the life of the tires is required for proper selection. Tire selection can {{have a significant impact on}} production and unit cost. There are three types of <b>off-the-road</b> <b>tires,</b> transport for earthmoving machines, work for slow moving earth moving machines, and load and carry for transporting as well as digging. Off-highway tires have six categories of service C compactor, E earthmover, G grader, L loader, LS log-skidder and ML mining and logging. Within these service categories are various tread types designed for use on hard-packed surface, soft surface and rock. Tires are a large expense on any construction project, careful consideration should be given to prevent excessive wear or damage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Off-the-road</b> (OTR) <b>tires</b> {{include all}} tires not {{running on the}} common roads, such as fitted on {{construction}} vehicles (wheel loaders, backhoes, graders, trenchers), on airplanes, on mining vehicles, on forestry machinery. OTR tires can be of either bias or radial construction although the industry is trending toward increasing use of radial. Bias OTR tires are built {{with a large number}} of reinforcing plies to withstand severe service conditions and high loads.|$|R
50|$|Tires are {{classified}} into several standard types, {{based on the}} type of vehicle they serve. Since the manufacturing process, raw materials, and equipment vary according to the tire type, it is common for tire factories to specialize in one or more tire types. In most markets, factories that manufacture passenger and light truck radial tires are separate and distinct from those that make aircraft or <b>off-the-road</b> (OTR) <b>tires.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{experimental}} and numerical methods {{were used to}} analyse the performance of multi-piece wheel structures and two proposed innovative designs to enhance safety were validated by computer simulations. Fatality report analyses revealed that the majority (90 %) of the multi-piece wheel failures were caused by use of lock rings. Experimental tire and rim base tests were conducted to understand the deflection characteristics of <b>off-the-road</b> <b>tires</b> and to validate the finite element model of a five-piece wheel/tire (sized 29. 5 - 29) assembly. A linear relationship {{was found between the}} vertical displacement of the wheel and the maximum lateral deflection of the tire for both static and quasi static loading tests. A robust tire model was validated with an average accumulative error of 9. 7 % and an average validation metric of 0. 96 for tire deflections, compared to the experimental tests. The rim base model was validated with an average error of 7. 6 % and an average validation metric of 0. 93 for wheel deformations, and an average accumulative error of 12. 7 % and an average validation metric of 0. 88 for strains, compared to experimental tests. Based on validated FE model of the five-piece wheel/tire assembly, geometry degradation (material wear out at critical regions) and material degradation (fatigue and corrosion) were studied to estimate their effects on fatigue lives. Two design innovations were proposed to enhance safety and fatigue life of the five-piece wheel. The threaded-connection design reduced the possibility of failure due to the mismatched wheel components. The BS band pull-out simulation revealed that the threaded-connection design was twice as strong as the conventional five-piece design in holding wheel components and the tire together, and the wheel may fail in a safer mode. The fatigue lives of the rim base were two orders of magnitude higher than those of the conventional five-piece wheel. The two-piece wheel design completely removed the possibility of wheel failure due to mismatched wheel components; the fatigue lives were increased by over two orders of magnitude, compared to the conventional five-piece wheel...|$|R
40|$|The {{disposal}} of large <b>Off-the-Road</b> (OTR) <b>tires</b> is {{an increasingly important}} concern. These tires can weigh up to 8, 450 pounds with an overall diameter and width of approximately 140. 7 inches and 45. 1 inches respectively. OTR tires are used for mining vehicles such as haul trucks, wheel loaders, backhoes, graders, and trenchers. [1] These new tires cost between $ 38, 000 and $ 50, 000 each, depending on multiple factors including oil prices and the cyclical nature of the industry. Haul trucks contain six tires per vehicle, and mines replace these tires around every 9 - 12 months. [2] Statistics regarding discarded OTR tires are not provided by the industry as they are for other types of tires. Thus, {{it is difficult to}} approximate the number and location of waste OTR tires not only in individual states, but in the U. S. in general. [3] Currently, Minnesota and Arizona are the only states that place regulations and fees on OTR tires. However, Minnesota is the only state that actually tracks them. [3] The Rubber Manufacturers Association (RMA) roughly estimates that OTR tires account for 1 % of scrap tires by number and 15 % by weight. When the tires are replaced, the old tires can be discarded with the waste rock in stockpiles at the mining site but more often are landfilled without documentation by an appropriate agency due to lack of federal regulations. Their low density and hollow centers cause them to float to the top of landfills, disrupting the compactness. [4] Also, tires have a heat content 20 - 40 % greater than that of coal which can be very dangerous on the rare occasions that tires catch fire in stockpiles. [5] Furthermore, burning tires release hazardous substances including pyrolytic oil, ash, and smoke, which contain carcinogens, heavy metals, and other toxic compounds. [6] Due to the large size of OTR tires, there are few facilities that can accommodate their recycling. [3] This leads to increased costs in transporting them to such sites. Transportation costs for a tire taken out of service can be up to $ 1000. In addition to the freight costs, recycling an OTR tire can cost up to $ 1500 because of their rugged construction compared to passenger tires which cost around $ 1 to recycle. [3] In response to the waste OTR tire problem, the Ball Hogs from the University of Arkansas have designed a solution that recycles OTR tires by using old tires as liners in ball mills for hard rock mines. Ball mills are large cylindrical vessels consisting of an outer shell, an inside liner and a load of metal balls. A motor turns the ball mill using a transmission system causing the metal balls to move in a cascading motion to grind the material fed into the ball mill. Ball mills require liners that are constructed from materials such as steel or rubber. For a 30 ft long ball mill with a Task # 2 5 University of Arkansas 20 ft diameter, a hard rubber liner reinforced with steel can cost $ 150, 000. These liners are replaced at least once a year, creating a substantial upkeep cost for these ball mills. Metal mines in Bolivia are already using tractor tires to line many ball mills. This technique has been effective for over twenty years. The high import costs of new liners and the low cost of labor has led many Bolivian metal processors to use truck and tractor tires as liners in their ball mills. This construction normally occurs on site using tools like handsaws, drills, torches and knives to cut up tires and manpower to mount these tire-made liners onto mills. However, this is not always the case in the U. S. where labor costs are much higher and the mills are generally larger. Many mines in the U. S. do not have the means to fabricate and install these liners on site; therefore, a third-party solution is proposed that will take a mine’s discarded tires and make ball mill liners out of them. The Ball Hogs’ solution provides an environmentally and economically feasible process of increasing the life of OTR tires beyond their typical use. This alternative would utilize the engineering and technology that makes these tires strong enough to hold a 400 ton truck. Mining companies would save yearly an average of $ 70, 000 per ball mill liner replacement, and over 780, 000 kg of CO 2 per liner. Furthermore, mining companies would earn positive PR, goodwill, and tax breaks. We recommend all mining companies use their OTR tire treads as ball mill liners...|$|R
