5|$|Within {{less than}} a week of the mutiny, a Court <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> was set up to {{investigate}} and collect evidence for the trial for the mutineers. Although the Court <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> was meant to take place behind closed doors, as accordance with standard military procedures, the proceeding was held in public instead. According to Harper and Miller this was to give the public the impression that the mutineers “were being tried for mutiny and shooting with intent to kill and not, as alleged for refusal to go to Turkey’’. Although the Court <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> was clearly trying to downplay the link between Turkey and the mutiny, with the declassification of new documents and evidence, another perception has emerged in explaining the cause of the mutiny and that is the role of pan-Islamism. Contrary to official British colonial authorities, the mutiny was not an isolated case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti-British and pro-Muslim battle.|$|E

5|$|Phenomenology is {{a method}} <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> that {{attempts}} to examine the structure of consciousness in its own right, putting aside problems regarding the relationship of consciousness to the physical world. This approach was first proposed by the philosopher Edmund Husserl, and later elaborated by other philosophers and scientists. Husserl's original concept gave rise to two distinct lines <b>of</b> <b>inquiry,</b> in philosophy and psychology. In philosophy, phenomenology has largely been devoted to fundamental metaphysical questions, such as the nature of intentionality ("aboutness"). In psychology, phenomenology largely has meant attempting to investigate consciousness using the method of introspection, which means looking into one's own mind and reporting what one observes. This method fell into disrepute {{in the early twentieth}} century because of grave doubts about its reliability, but has been rehabilitated to some degree, especially when used in combination with techniques for examining brain activity.|$|E

5|$|A Naval Board <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had happened. The {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know what they were talking about.|$|E
5|$|A naval board <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> was {{appointed}} shortly afterwards that determined {{the cause of}} the collision was of a lack of seamanship by the captain and watch officers of the ship. The Justice Minister, Kobie Coetsee, subsequently introduced a retrospective change in law to allow him to hold an inquest into the death of the only crewman whose body was found. The inquest lasted a year and apportioned blame on the captain and PWO.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry,</b> 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin.

While he cared for the welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E
