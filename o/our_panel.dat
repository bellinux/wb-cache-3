The section received a record number of submissions. Even with <b>our</b> large <b>panel</b> allocation, the division chairs were faced with some very difficult choices. Although they were able to field a substantial proportion of these proposals, there were of course some that the section was not able to include. The long-term solution is to secure a larger number of panels.

5000|$|Lipez {{opened his}} {{concurrence}} opinion as follows: -Concurring Opinion Follows-LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment. Despite our court's 2005 en banc decision rejecting {{the right of}} Puerto Rico's four million residents to vote in presidential elections, the issue of federal voting rights for these longstanding United States citizens remains a compelling legal problem. The unequal distribution of the fundamental privilege of voting among different categories of citizens is deeply troubling and, not surprisingly, the legal {{arguments in favor of}} enfranchising Puerto Rico residents have continued to evolve. Although the en banc decision forecloses this panel's reconsideration of issues the full court resolved, that decision should not be the final word on the subject. Judge Torruella's dissent highlights important issues that deserve consideration in a new en banc proceeding. As I shall explain, if each of those issues were decided in plaintiffs' favor, United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico would have a viable claim to equal voting rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (“ICCPR”).Thus, while I agree with Chief Judge Lynch that <b>our</b> <b>panel</b> must adhere to the precedent set five years ago by the en banc court on the constitutional and treaty interpretation issues addressed in the majority opinion, I cannot agree that the plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed without review by the full court. Given the magnitude of the issues and Judge Torruella's forceful analysis, {{this is one of those}} rare occasions when reconsideration of an en banc ruling is warranted.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015 Vann {{created an}} {{evaluation}} system as the 21st Century award for quality and credibility called Liquor Rank. It exists {{to provide the}} definitive last word on spirits and beverage evaluation and provide you limitless opportunities to market your brand. Each product is reviewed under ideal tasting conditions {{by a panel of}} experts of which Vann is a seat member, who know what they and ultimately consumers, are looking for. Each product submitted to Liquor Rank is evaluated and ranked in blind tastings ensuring your rank is bias free. Beer wine and spirits industry trade buyers and consumers recognize and respond to the value of Liquor Rank's accolades and scores, setting itself apart from over saturated liquor competitions that will hand over a medal to almost anyone who enters, Liquor Rank is different; it's the last word on quality. A favorable Liquor Rank is easily and immediately recognized as a symbol of achievement as it was earned via the ultimate definition of balanced spirits evaluation. Your brand truly earns its score, it doesn't just get awarded a medal for showing up. Victoria has said this about how Liquor Rank works, [...] "Literally, you take a number, and we all know numbers are useful. They help us count; our money, our time, and just where we stand in the world. In the world of selling more liquor it is your Liquor Rank that counts. You put your heart and soul into this spirit, now it's time to tell everyone just how good it is. Your Liquor Rank is based on your product and your product alone. It's not about how you stack up against the next guy, not what another category is doing in terms of increasing their sales and market penetration, but, quite simply your Liquor Rank reflects the positive qualities your liquid brings to the glass. Liquor Rank is the defining number that, at a glance, allows buyers and consumers to know just what to expect when they pick up your bottle. Like well respected wine industry ratings systems Liquor Rank is based on a 20 point scale, set from 80-100. Your product is judged on its merits; taste, texture, color, aroma, mixability, and price. All of these factors are considered by <b>our</b> <b>panel</b> of experts." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{insulation}} <b>panels</b> {{developed in}} <b>our</b> previous study {{are composed of}} wood shavings cold-pressed into a mat with a density of around 100 kg/m 3 without any binder. This elastic mat is lapped with plastic film that works as a damp proof course and is installed between studs or joists of timber frame houses. In the fireproof test of this insulation panel, {{it was observed that}} <b>our</b> insulation <b>panels</b> remained unbroken between studs after they burned, which suggests that a wood shaving elastic mat can hardly shrink in its compressive direction. This led to the present research work, carbonizing <b>our</b> insulation <b>panels</b> for better insulation capacity and durability since changes of macro and micro-pores caused by carbonization may provide <b>our</b> <b>panels</b> with better insulation capacity and carbonization itself can remove a risk of decay. In this paper, thermal conductivities of the panels are discussed in relation to their manufacturing factors such as initial panel density and carbonizing temperature. Panels with an initial density of 150, 200, 250 and 300 kg/m^ 3 and with a size of 200 by 200 by 50 mm were manufactured and then, they were carbonized at five different temperatures of 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 ℃. A good panel formability was obtained at a combination of 200 - 300 kg/m^ 3 and 400 - 500 ℃. The smallest thermal conductivity was 0. 044 W/mK and it was obtained at a combination of 250 kg/m^ 3 and 400 ℃ that satisfied above mentioned manufacturing conditions with good panel formability. This thermal conductivity was 20 % less than that of our previous woods having panels. Macro-pore distributions of the panel sections were obtained by micrograph and image analysis. The results revealed that carbonizing at 400 ℃ provides the panels with less macro-pore of 3 mm^ 2 and over which may cause air convection resulting in a higher thermal conductivity. Furthermore, water adsorption isotherm at 20 ℃ was determined, and {{it was found that the}} hygroscopicity was lower than before carbonizing and was different between 400 ℃　and 700 ℃. One reason for better insulation capacity of carbonized panels is thought to be less hygroscopic and much micro porous inside wood shavings than <b>our</b> previous <b>panels...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pension {{reform is}} one of the biggest {{challenges}} facing national governments. How to reform the old pay-as-you-go (PAYG) systems is still under hot debate; one of the most influential funded pension schemes is designed by the World Bank. In the second chapter of this paper, we first review the arguments for and against the PAYG and then critically discuss the World Bank model by drawing on related literature. The third chapter of this paper presents our empirical results. Regarding the link between economic growth and pension reform towards World Bank model, <b>our</b> <b>panel</b> estimation suggests a negative relationship in the short run and positive relationship in the long run, although the results for OECD countries are not very statistically robust. The second empirical work is focused on pension fund assets and economic growth. A positive link between these two variables is found by our standard economic growth specifications; in addition, there is evidence that pensions are a good predictor of economic growth. This result is then consolidated by <b>our</b> <b>Panel</b> Granger causality test. The last empirical work deals with the relationship between pension assets and financial development. On balance, <b>our</b> <b>Panel</b> correction model and Panel Granger causality test suggest that pension funds growth leads financial development, although some sub-group estimations are not strong.
