25|$|Holmes was {{originally}} hired on Just Ask Jon Eakes, a home improvement show (also on HGTV and formerly in the US on sister network DIY Network) hosted by Jon Eakes, for some behind-the-scenes work. Mike Holmes approached the show's producers Scott Clark McNeil and Michael Quast {{with an idea}} for a new kind of home improvement show. Holmes did not intend that he appear <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> the producers made this a condition of the deal. Although submissions to be on the show were initially few and far between, with Holmes doing work on small botched jobs early on in the series, the number of submissions quickly ballooned by the show's fourth season. In its last season, the show was directed by The Holmes Group's Vice President Pete Kettlewell, who had worked on the show from the first season where he did the show's audio, produced by The Holmes Group's Vice President Michael Quast, who had been with the show since the fifth season, and also produced by Mike Holmes himself.|$|E
500|$|Sawa {{described}} {{his role as}} [...] "in the beginning, [...] was kinda loopy and cotter, and you know, probably not the most popular guy in school. I think {{he might have been}} a dork, you know, doing their stuff and they had their own thing going and they're after the two beautiful girls in school, but there's no chance of that happening. I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes". [...] "Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible," [...] Wong said. [...] "He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. [...] He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero". Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as [...] "a very distinctive actor. He's very loose and he's kind of a cut-up when he's not <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> the moment the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment".|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1992, Chapman gave two {{television}} interviews. On December 4, 1992, 20/20 aired {{an interview}} that he gave to Barbara Walters, his first television interview since the shooting. [...] On December 17, 1992, Larry King interviewed Chapman on his program Larry King Live. In 2000, with his first parole hearing approaching, Jack Jones asked Chapman to tell his story for Mugshots, a CourtTV program. Chapman refused to go <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>but,</b> after praying over it, consented to tell his story in a series of audiotapes.|$|E
5000|$|From 1978, Waaske {{had his own}} {{technical}} design office in Braunschweig, working not only <b>on</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>but</b> also, for instance, on loudspeaker systems which went into production with Blaupunkt. His work was characterised by a [...] "technical minimalism", with small and scarse pieces providing as many functions as possible.|$|R
5000|$|One {{episode of}} Supermarket Sweep from 1991 {{featured}} Johnny Gilbert mentioning during the Big Sweep {{to a team}} member named Barry (who also appeared on Monopoly): [...] "He thinks he's <b>on</b> Candid <b>Camera,</b> <b>but</b> he knows he's on Supermarket Sweep!".|$|R
30|$|Platform Attestation. Based on TC {{attestation}} techniques, {{the status}} of the platform is reported to the system operator. This not only allows one to reliably check which firmware is running <b>on</b> a <b>camera</b> <b>but</b> also which computer vision applications are executed. This is especially important if the NodeManager is capable of reconfiguring the system dynamically at runtime.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{is in an}} apartment; Chad Kroeger and Ryan Peake {{are singing}} <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> no {{instruments}} are played; the other band members are seen simply staring at the camera, or into space. It was filmed over 2 days, in Newark, NJ ...|$|E
5000|$|After two years, {{starred in}} [...] "Sin Horizontal" [...] and after these three films, made little work <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> {{worked as a}} film {{production}} assistant, where he studied photography to have a small studio and is currently a technical and computer instructor at a multinational.|$|E
50|$|Stanley {{revolved}} around the adventures of the namesake character (Hackett) as the operator of a newsstand in a posh New York City hotel. Burnett played his girlfriend, Celia, and Lynde voiced the unseen hotel owner, Mr. Fenton, who never appeared <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>but</b> could frequently be heard giving orders to his staff.|$|E
50|$|The F80 accepts all F-mount Nikkor lenses {{with the}} {{exception}} of many pre AI, and all IX, lenses (these cannot be mounted on the F80 without causing damage). Older non-CPU AI and AIS lenses can be mounted <b>on</b> the <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> exposure must be set manually as the camera will not meter through them at all.|$|R
50|$|Perspective is a {{property}} that depends only <b>on</b> viewpoint (<b>camera</b> position). <b>But</b> if moving a lens to a smaller-format camera causes a photographer to move {{further from the}} subject, then the perspective will be affected.|$|R
5000|$|For {{historical}} reasons, sensor size specifications such as 1/2.5" [...] do {{not match}} the actual sensor size, but are a bit larger (typically about a factor of 1.5) than the actual sensor diagonal. This is because these sensor size specifications refer {{to the size of}} a camera tube, while the usable sensor size is about 2/3 of the size of the tube. Tubes are not used <b>on</b> digital <b>cameras,</b> <b>but</b> the same specifications are used.|$|R
5000|$|... "They {{were up in}} {{the rafters}} where all the heat was, so they were all sweating," [...] Kendall said. [...] "It was {{probably}} a very unusual situation to perform in and be <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> Dave Mustaine was just great. Every time I'd ask him to do another take he was like, 'Sure, definitely.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Cribbs played {{himself in}} {{an episode of}} Hot In Cleveland, [...] "The Gateway Friend," [...] which {{originally}} aired May 2, 2012. He appeared in the bar/restaurant that Melanie, Joy, and Victoria frequent, placing second in a karaoke contest to guest star Kristin Chenoweth. He did not actually sing <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> did have multiple lines.|$|E
5000|$|Adam Ward, {{the first}} assistant/focus puller, says the scenes at the {{abandoned}} Opera House were unexpectedly difficult to film. [...] "It's {{one thing to}} see it on camera and another being on location in this theater that hasn't been used other than for film shots for decades. You {{get in there and}} the matter that floats around looks great <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>but</b> you just don't want to breathe it in." ...|$|E
50|$|Forward and {{backward}} compatibility was maintained {{in most cases}} so that the newer lenses could be used <b>on</b> older <b>cameras,</b> and old standard lenses could be used <b>on</b> the newer <b>cameras,</b> <b>but</b> of course without the advanced automation. However, Olympus FTL lenses and Fujica screw mount lenses had a projecting cam {{which means that they}} cannot be fully screwed down on a regular screw mount body.|$|R
5000|$|LOMO is a Russian {{photographic}} manufacturer, it {{made some}} lenses for the Almaz <b>camera</b> <b>on</b> K-mount, <b>but</b> caution {{must be used}} as the Almaz version has some differences with the standard K-mount ...|$|R
5000|$|Kenne Duncan (February 17, 1903 [...] - [...] February 5, 1972) was a Canadian-born B-movie {{character}} actor. Hyped professionally as [...] "The Meanest Man in the Movies," [...] {{the vast}} majority of his over 250 appearances <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> were Westerns, <b>but</b> he also did occasional forays into horror, crime drama, and science fiction. He also appeared in over a dozen serials.|$|R

50|$|However, {{his former}} musical partner, Simon Quint (Barry Williams), now an environmentalist, realizes the {{creature}} {{is the last}} of its species, and is determined to make sure it does not become extinct. Harley goes to great lengths to kill the creature, in order to save his concert from being cancelled, but Simon thinks that the creature is just protecting its territory from trespassers. Harley assembles a team of hunters and mercenaries to track down Bigfoot. A group of men and women try to capture Bigfoot <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> all of them get killed.|$|E
5000|$|When he {{was nine}} years old, Ward {{contracted}} poliomyelitis, and wears leg braces. He later cited Franklin Roosevelt {{as a source of}} inspiration on how to overcome his handicap. When interviewed for The Roosevelts, Ward [...] "was determined not to get emotional", as Ken Burns said later, when discussing the [...] "terror" [...] felt by FDR during his ordeal in 1921; Burns did not mention Ward's disability <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> he had waited until the end of their interview before getting to questions on FDR's polio, at which point Ward [...] "was taken aback and the emotions caught him".|$|E
50|$|In {{cases with}} {{negative}} endoscopic findings and high clinical suspicion, selective angiography of the mesenteric arteries is sometimes necessary, but this allows for interventions {{at time of}} the procedure. An alternative is scintigraphy with red blood cells labeled with a radioactive marker; this shows {{the site of the}} bleeding <b>on</b> a gamma <b>camera</b> <b>but</b> tends to be unhelpful unless the bleeding is continuous and significant.|$|R

5000|$|Like her {{previous}} single, [...] "Secret Ambition", the video features two Nana egos, one being an inactive, innocent one, {{dressed in white}} clothing. The other ego, dressed in red clothing, dances and sings. In a high-tech setting, the white-clothed one is held captive and/or hostage by masked uniformed people as her hands are bound together and she is constantly followed and supervised by them. The uniformed people also seem to be monitoring both Nana Mizuki egos <b>on</b> video <b>cameras,</b> <b>but</b> the red-clothed ego seems to dance and sing freely in a separate room by herself(In the edit version the red-clothed ego is wearing sunglasses).|$|R
5000|$|Whether in a formal, sit-down {{interview}} setting or {{an impromptu}} {{meeting on the}} street, some sources request that {{all or part of}} the encounter not be captured in an audio or video recording ("tape"), but continue speaking to the reporter. As long as the interview is not confidential, the reporter may report the information given by the source, even repeating direct quotes (perhaps scribbled on a notepad or recalled from memory). This often shows up in broadcasts as [...] "John Brown declined to be interviewed <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> said" [...] or simply [...] "a spokesperson said".|$|E
5000|$|Asakawa {{finished}} high school and began junior college. When {{she realized that she}} could not make much money doing part-time work she decided to start doing adult videos, and later explained, [...] "I wanted to study to get a decent wage but I can't do that while I have a regular 9-5 job, right? So I picked AVs." [...] She had thought about stripping but decided that the hours were too long. She says she cried after making her first video [...] "wondering what I was doing to myself". She finally got to like sex <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>but</b> keeps her eyes closed from embarrassment.|$|E
50|$|In May 2007, upon re-signing her {{contract}} with Vivid for another six films, Leone agreed {{to perform for}} the first time with men <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> exclusively with her fiancé, Matt Erikson. That summer she also received breast augmentation, and shot her first movie under the new contract titled Sunny Loves Matt. The movie led to her being nominated for three (out of six) AVN awards in 2009 in addition to being a choice for Female Performer of the Year. She followed up her first boy-girl title with The Other Side of Sunny in October 2008, which would be the last time she would perform with Erikson.|$|E
500|$|Thunderbirds Are Go {{was filmed}} in {{widescreen}} Techniscope, {{a subset of}} Technicolor, with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. This represented {{a significant departure from}} the 4:3 picture used for the television episodes. The anamorphic lenses of Panavision, a popular system for Hollywood productions during the 1960s, proved to be unsuitable for special effects shots due to the depth of field of the <b>cameras.</b> Techniscope, <b>on</b> the other hand, could be used in conjunction with spherical lenses while attaining the [...] "letterbox" [...] image of mainstream films that were shot on 35mm film. All AP Films productions had up to this point been filmed <b>on</b> Arriflex <b>Cameras,</b> <b>but</b> for the film these were replaced with the Mitchell brand.|$|R
50|$|The {{contemporary}} AI lenses for the FE {{were the}} Nikkor AI-S, Nikkor AI and Nikon Series E types. The newer AF-S Nikkor, AF-I Nikkor, AF Nikkor D and AF Nikkor autofocus lenses are also AI types. They will work, but with manual focus only.Most pre-AI lenses will also work <b>on</b> the <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> the meter coupling lever used for aperture indexing on AI-lenses must be unlocked and raised (out of the way) before attaching the lens, and the exposure {{must be done}} when pressing down the depth of field lever. This feature was removed on FE2 (and FM2), and pre-AI lenses had to be converted before they could be used (by changing or modifying the aperture ring).|$|R

50|$|He {{wrote for}} the stage, radio, and for {{television}} programs such as General Motors Theatre, The Unforeseen, Playdate, Hatch's Mill, The Forest Rangers, and <b>On</b> <b>Camera,</b> <b>but</b> he is most famous for his novels, the Bandy Papers, which recount the humorous adventures of Bartholomew Bandy, a World War I fighter pilot. His play The Canvas Barricade was the first Canadian play produced at the Stratford Festival of Canada. Other stage plays included Exit Muttering, Crash, and Minuet for Brass Band. He had 39 TV plays produced, 22 radio plays, and numerous documentaries. Most of Jack's book-length works are being re-published, or published for the first time, by Sybertooth.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the following episode, [...] "Working the Brand", host Jodhi Meares appeared in a message to viewers {{before the start of the}} episode explaining that the events of the previous week were examples of natural teenage behavior and the team behind Australia's Next Top Model did not support nor condone the behavior. Reveley apologized to Rowan <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> also stated in a confessional that the incident had been [...] "blown out of proportion". Rowan was ultimately eliminated that same episode. As a consequence of the bullying, numerous forums and media outlets decided they would not support Reveley if she was chosen as one of the final two.|$|E
5000|$|Maris Crane is Niles Crane's {{wife for}} much of the series. She is unseen <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>but</b> often the subject of plotlines and jokes. Her maiden name was never {{revealed}} on the series. Maris is immensely wealthy, much wealthier than Niles, as well as spoiled, dominating, and neurotic. Many of the characters pointedly dislike her (to Niles' consternation), with Frasier contributing in the show's first episode, [...] "Maris is like the sun ... except without the warmth". In a further humorous vein, David Hyde Pierce passively describes Maris during a Montréal comedy performance (which he performs in-character) as [...] "...a wife who's like a refugee from Taming of the Shrew..." ...|$|E
50|$|In June 2015, {{production}} on Hitting Home {{began in the}} South Coast Correctional Centre (Nowra) on day 1 of a 10-week rehabilitation program aimed at preventing violent men from reoffending. After a very long process of negotiation and building trust, Ferguson and the producers convinced two of the inmates to appear <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> fully identified. <b>But</b> before either inmate could appear <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> the producers had to identify and seek permission from their respective victims. Both women agreed to tell {{their side of the}} story. Their interviews and police footage captured {{in the aftermath of the}} attack were incorporated into the series.|$|R
50|$|The creatures are, supposedly, {{occasionally}} caught <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> {{such as the}} Cave Creature. They {{are also}} shown as a digital rendering that appears before and after commercial breaks. The team attempts to capture these creature (with Hogzilla and three Devil Dogs being their most recent trapped creatures). In some instances the team places trail cameras and/or infrared camcorders near the trap to capture photographic evidence of the creature in question. They have caught fleeting, blurry images of what they {{claim to be the}} Grassman, Shadow Creature, Cherokee Death Cat and the Black Wolf <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> to name <b>but</b> a few. More recently the recurring Rogue Team has spied on and sabotaged the AIMS team and their investigations.|$|R
5000|$|While {{inside the}} Łódź Ghetto, Mendel Grossman took over 10,000 {{photographs}} of the monstrosities inside. Grossman secretly took these photos from inside his raincoat using materials taken from the Statistics Department. He was deported to a labor camp in Koenigs Wusterhausen and stayed there until 16 April 1945. Ill and exhausted, he was shot by Nazis during a forced death march, still holding <b>on</b> to his <b>camera</b> <b>but</b> the negatives of his photos were discovered and published in the book, With a Camera in the Ghetto. The photos illustrate the sad reality of how the Germans dealt with the Jews.|$|R
