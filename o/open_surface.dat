5|$|The {{formation}} of Hurricane Rafael {{is attributed to}} a low-latitude tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on October5. The wave remained disorganized until roughly midway between the Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles, at which time a broad {{area of low pressure}} developed and convection began to consolidate around it. As a result, the disturbance was introduced into the National Hurricane Center (NHC)'s 48-hour Tropical Weather Outlook with a low chance of tropical development. These chances were subsequently raised as further development occurred, with the system receiving a medium chance of development early on October10, and a high chance of development as it approached the southern Leeward Islands late the following evening. As the wave crossed into the eastern Caribbean Sea and slowed down, the previously broad and <b>open</b> <b>surface</b> low consolidated and became stacked with the mid-level center. The disturbance was already producing tropical storm-force winds, and as a result, skipped tropical depression status to become Tropical Storm Rafael at 1800UTC on October12. At this time, the cyclone was located roughly 200mi (320km) south-southeast of St. Croix.|$|E

Using a natural principle of density diffusion in physics, we propose an effective algorithm for computing density-equalizing flattening maps with any prescribed density distribution. By varying the initial density distribution, a large variety of mappings with different properties can be achieved. For instance, area-preserving parameterizations of simply-connected <b>open</b> <b>surfaces</b> can be easily computed. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Applications to data visualization and surface remeshing are explored...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} phase diagram of {{statistical}} systems of closed and open interfaces {{built on a}} cubic lattice. Interacting closed interfaces can be written as Ising models, while <b>open</b> <b>surfaces</b> as Z(2) gauge systems. When the <b>open</b> <b>surfaces</b> reduce to closed interfaces with few defects, also the gauge model can be written as an Ising spin model. We apply the lower bound renormalization group (LBRG) transformation introduced by Kadanoff (Phys. Rev. Lett. 34, 1005 (1975)) to study the Ising models describing closed and <b>open</b> <b>surfaces</b> with few defects. In particular, we have studied the Ising-like transition of self-avoiding surfaces between the random-isotropic phase and the phase with broken global symmetry at varying values of the mean curvature. Our results are compared with previous numerical work. The limits of the LBRG transformation in describing regions of the phase diagram where not ferromagnetic ground-states are relevant are also discussed.

2500|$|The Baltic Sea's {{salinity}} is {{much lower}} than that of ocean water (which averages 3.5%), as a result of abundant freshwater runoff from the surrounding land, combined with the shallowness of the sea itself; runoff contributes roughly one-fortieth its total volume per year, as the volume of the basin is about [...] and yearly runoff is about [...] The <b>open</b> <b>surface</b> waters of the central basin have salinity of 0.5% to 0.8%, which makes the basin border-line freshwater. Drinking the water as a means of survival would actually hydrate the body instead of dehydrating, {{as is the case with}} ocean water. At the semi-enclosed bays with major freshwater inflows, such as the head of Finnish Gulf with the Neva mouth and the head of the Bothnian Gulf with the close mouths of the Lule, Tornio and Kemi, the salinity is considerably lower. Below , the salinity is between 1.0% and 1.5% in the open Baltic Sea, and higher near the Danish Straits, but this is still less than half that of ocean water.|$|E
2500|$|The {{area between}} Sollum, Maddalena, Bir el Gubi and Tobruk {{is larger than}} East Anglia and except near the coast, has a hard, flat and <b>open</b> <b>surface,</b> easy for desert-worthy {{vehicles}} to cross, except after rain. From Bardia west to El Adem the ground undulates with several east–west ridges, the north-facing sides usually being escarpments only passable by vehicles in a few places. Further north is the Via Balbia along the coast and then a jumble of wadis to the sea shore. One ridge is north of the Trigh Capuzzo track, which runs along {{either side of the}} southern escarpment. Near El Adem the Trigh Capuzzo lies between the ridges as does the Tobruk by-pass, built during the Siege of Tobruk. About [...] east of El Adem, opposite Sidi Rezegh the by-pass turns north between Ed Duda, a small hill on the west side and Belhamed to the east. The area of Sidi Rezegh, Ed Duda and Belhamed was an Axis transport bottleneck which gave it great tactical importance to both sides. Point 175 was a rise on the escarpment just east of Sidi Rezegh, with a cairn and a nearby blockhouse.|$|E
2500|$|DESI {{has been}} widely studied since its {{inception}} in 2004 by Professor Zoltan Takáts, [...] et al., in Professor Graham Cooks' group from Purdue University with the goal of looking into methods that didn't require the sample to be inside of a vacuum. Both DESI and direct analysis in real time (DART) have been largely responsible for the rapid growth in ambient ionization techniques, with a proliferation of more than thirty new techniques being found today. These methods allow for complex systems to be analyzed without preparation and throughputs as high as 45 samples a minute. DESI is a combination popular techniques, such as, electrospray ionization and surface desorption techniques. Electrospray ionization with mass spectrometry was reported by Malcolm Dole in 1968, but John Bennett Fenn was awarded a nobel prize in chemistry for the development of ESI-MS in the late 1980s. Then in 1999, desorption of <b>open</b> <b>surface</b> and free matrix experiments were reported in the literature utilizing an experiment that was called desorption/ionization on silicon. The combination of these two advancements led to the introduction of DESI and DART as the main ambient ionization techniques that would later become multiple different techniques. One in particular, due to increasing studies into optimization of DESI is, Nanospray desorption electrospray ionization. In this technique the analyte is desorbed into a bridge formed via two capillaries and the analysis surface.|$|E

An <b>open</b> algebraic <b>surface</b> is understood as a Zariski open set of a projective algebraic surface.

60|$|But {{if we can}} not artificially {{produce the}} {{phenomenon}} A, the conclusion that it is the cause of a remains subject to very considerable doubt. Though an invariable, {{it may not be the}} unconditional antecedent of a, but may precede it as day precedes night or night day. This uncertainty arises from the impossibility of assuring ourselves that A is the only immediate antecedent common to both the instances. If we could be certain of having ascertained all the invariable antecedents, we might be sure that the unconditional invariable antecedent, or cause, must be found somewhere among them. Unfortunately it is hardly ever possible to ascertain all the antecedents, unless the phenomenon is one which we can produce artificially. Even then, the difficulty is merely lightened, not removed: men knew how to raise water in pumps long before they adverted to what was really the operating circumstance in the means they employed, namely, the pressure of the atmosphere on the <b>open</b> <b>surface</b> of the water. It is, however, much easier to analyze completely a set of arrangements made by ourselves, than the whole complex mass of the agencies which nature happens to be exerting at the moment of the production of a given phenomenon.
