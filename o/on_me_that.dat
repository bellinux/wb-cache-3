5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
25|$|During the 13 months (in the) almost continual and {{sustained}} combat in which I have ever participated, there were moments, and rare ones, I am sure; but they lose {{none of their}} terror or horror for which fear laid a relentless and a powerful hold <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> the pull of cowardice was almost more than I could ward off. There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime, an endlessness, when terror was so strong in me, that I could feel idiocy replace reason. (Yet,) I have never left my position, nor have I shirked hazardous duty. Fear {{did not make a}} coward out of me.|$|E
25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis {{and all that kind}} of stuff. And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E

500|$|According to Hubert Wellington, Delacroix—who {{would become}} the standard-bearer of French Romanticism after Géricault's death—wrote, [...] "Géricault allowed me to see his Raft of Medusa {{while he was still}} working on it.

500|$|The critic Eduard Hanslick {{objected to}} the {{religious}} air surrounding Parsifal even at the premiere: [...] "The question of whether Parsifal should really be withheld from all theatres and limited to... Bayreuth was naturally on all tongues... I must state here that the church scenes in Parsifal {{did not make the}} offensive impression <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> others and I had been led to expect from reading the libretto. They are religious situations – but for all their earnest dignity they are not {{in the style of the}} church, but completely in the style of the opera. Parsifal is an opera, call it a 'stage festival' or 'consecrational stage festival' if you will." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Goode, {{a critic}} for Insight on the News, {{considered}} the piece {{to be the}} beginning of the Pop Art movement, labeling the work [...] "a sign of things to come as other artists tackled common yet sacrosanct items, including the American flag". Lichtenstein, reflecting on his work, told reporters, [...] "The idea of counterfeiting money always occurs to you when you do lithography". Despite the assessments of critics, Lichtenstein, in an interview with Joan Marter, considered the work to be [...] "a kind of Cubist dollar bill, not a Pop one". He continued, [...] "The fact it was a ten-dollar-bill at all [...] {{there was some kind of}} Pop influence <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I wasn't aware of so much. They're really not Pop at all. They're more funny, or humorous, or something".|$|E

500|$|During World War II, Miller {{served as}} part of a bomber crew that participated in the {{destruction}} of the ancient Roman Catholic monastery at Monte Cassino, Italy, founded by St. Benedict in the 6thcentury. This experience impressed him enough to write, a decade later, the short story [...] "A Canticle for Leibowitz" [...] about an order of monks whose abbey springs from the destroyed world around it. The story, which would evolve into [...] "Fiat Homo," [...] {{the first part of the}} novel, was published in the April 1955 edition of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (F). Although not originally intended as a serialization, the saga continued in [...] "And the Light Is Risen," [...] which was published in August 1956 (also in F). That work would later grow into [...] "Fiat Lux." [...] It was while writing the third [...] "novelette," [...] "The Last Canticle," [...] for magazine publication in February of the following year that Miller realized he was really completing a novel: [...] "Only after I had written the first two and was working on the third did it dawn <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> this isn't three novelettes, it's a novel. And I converted it." ...|$|E
500|$|As the 1970s began, the New Left faded away, {{and many}} {{movements}} arose in its wake– {{among them the}} feminist, men's liberation, spiritual, human potential, ecology, appropriate technology, intentional community, and holistic health movements. [...] After graduating from the University of British Columbia in 1972, Satin immersed himself in all these movements, either directly or {{as a reporter for}} Canada's underground press. [...] He also took up residence in a free-love commune. [...] "One fierce winter's day", he says,"... it dawned <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the ideas and energies from the various 'fringe' movements [...] beginning to generate a coherent new politics. [...] But I looked in vain for the people and groups that were expressing that new politics (instead of merely bits and pieces of it)". [...] Satin set out to write a book that would express the new politics in all its dimensions. [...] He wrote, designed, typeset, and printed the first edition of New Age Politics himself, in 1976. [...] A 240-page edition was published by Vancouver's Whitecap Books in 1978, and a 349-page edition by Dell Publishing Company in New York in 1979. It is now widely regarded as the [...] "first", [...] "most ambitious", or [...] "most adequate" [...] attempt to offer a systemic overview of the new post-socialist politics arising {{in the wake of the}} New Left. [...] Some academics say it offers a new ideology.|$|E
500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1954, during US Vice-President Richard Nixon's {{nineteen}} country Asian tour, he was lectured by Rajagopalachari on the consuming emotional {{quality of}} nuclear weapons. The pair discussed spiritual life, particularly reincarnation and predestination. Nixon wrote three pages of notes recording Rajagopalachari's words, claiming {{in his memoirs}} thirty-six years later that the afternoon [...] "had such a dramatic effect <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I used many of his thoughts in my speeches {{over the next several}} years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{professional}} tennis career, however, {{was going}} nowhere. [...] "When I looked around me, I saw that white tennis players, {{some of whom}} I had thrashed on the court, were picking up offers and invitations," [...] she wrote.

2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{earliest}} influence on comedy, Chappelle said, [...] "You know who was a big influence <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> is really weird is Bugs Bunny, That's just weird.

[...] "I had always tried to live by certain standards which I had presumed were acceptable to God," [...] he wrote, but he now believed he had been self-righteous in this presumption and, he wrote, [...] "I was looking towards God and seeing Him raise His finger. In God's judgement I was undeniably out." [...] He and his wife began to pursue a more intense kind of Christian belief.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the various}} films that have {{attracted}} nominations {{in all four}} acting categories, Sunset Boulevard {{is one of only}} three not to win in any category, the others being My Man Godfrey (1936) and American Hustle (2013). Its eleven Oscar nominations were exceeded only by the fourteen received by All About Eve, which won six awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Many critics predicted that the Best Actress award would be given to Gloria Swanson or Bette Davis for All About Eve and were surprised that the recipient was newcomer Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday. Swanson recalled the press's reaction following Holliday's win: [...] "It slowly dawned <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they were asking for a larger-than-life scene, or better still, a mad scene. More accurately, they were trying to flush out Norma Desmond." ...|$|E
2500|$|Herzog's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Aguirre was actor Klaus Kinski. The two had met many years earlier when the then-struggling young actor rented a room in Herzog’s family apartment, and Kinski’s often terrifying and {{deranged}} antics during the three months he lived there left a lasting impression on the director. Years later, Herzog remembered the volatile actor and knew that he was the only possible man who could play the mad Aguirre, and he sent Kinski a copy of the screenplay. [...] "Between three and four in the morning, the phone rang," [...] Herzog recalled. [...] "It took me {{at least a couple of}} minutes before I realized that it was Kinski who was the source of this inarticulate screaming. And after an hour of this, it dawned <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he found it the most fascinating screenplay and wanted to be Aguirre." ...|$|E

[...] {{is an example}} of a Neo-Western video game. Likewise, the television series Breaking Bad, which takes place in modern times, features many examples of Western archetypes. According to creator Vince Gilligan, [...] "After the first Breaking Bad episode, it started to dawn <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> we could be making a contemporary western.

2500|$|In November 2011, Romney {{said that}} the U.S. Supreme Court had made the right {{decision}} in its 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling, but that he did not like some of the consequences of it: [...] "I'm not wild about the idea of corporations making political contributions as a concept. I think their decision was a correct decision. I support their decision. I wish we {{could find a way to}} get money out of politics. I haven't found a way to do that." [...] In January 2012, in the midst of the Republican Party presidential nomination primaries battle, Romney criticized the existence of Super PACs that were playing a large role in the campaign, saying, [...] "I’ll tell you, there have been some—there have been some attacks <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> have just been outrageous and completely inaccurate and have been shown to be inaccurate. That’s the nature of the process. I hope it ends. ... We all would like to have super PACs disappear, to tell you the truth … I think this has to change." [...] A Romney spokesman added at the time that Romney viewed laws limiting regular donations to candidates' campaigns as too restrictive, which resulted in money going to Super PACs instead, and that it would be better if candidates' campaigns could receive those monies directly and take responsibility for ads made with them.|$|E
