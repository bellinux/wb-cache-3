5|$|The rules <b>of</b> <b>chess</b> (also {{known as}} the laws <b>of</b> <b>chess)</b> are rules {{governing}} the {{play of the game}} <b>of</b> <b>chess.</b> While the exact origins <b>of</b> <b>chess</b> are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from place to place. Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{classical}} school, many <b>of</b> the <b>chess</b> openings which had been hallmarks <b>of</b> Romantic <b>chess</b> such as the King's Gambit and Philidor's Defense fell out of use among elite players, while the Queen's Gambit, previously rare, began a staple <b>of</b> high-level <b>chess.</b>|$|R

50|$|From the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> recorded <b>chess,</b> {{to the establishment}} <b>of</b> the first <b>chess</b> organizations, the term master was applied informally, being {{simply a matter of}} popular acclaim. Strong players demonstrated their strength in play, and gained the informal reputation <b>of</b> being <b>chess</b> masters.|$|R
5|$|There were {{multiple}} side {{events that}} took place in order to promote the Chess Olympiad and the game <b>of</b> <b>chess</b> such as the operation <b>of</b> <b>chess</b> buses, 3D street art on chess topics, display of painted chess pieces, Chess Queen street performances, chess photography exhibitions, and parallel chess tournaments.|$|E
5|$|As the 19th century progressed, chess {{organization}} developed quickly. Many chess clubs, chess books, and chess journals appeared. There were correspondence matches between cities; for example, the London Chess Club {{played against}} the Edinburgh Chess Club in 1824. Chess problems became {{a regular part of}} 19th-century newspapers; Bernhard Horwitz, Josef Kling, and Samuel Loyd composed {{some of the}} most influential problems. In 1843, von der Lasa published his and Bilguer's Handbuch des Schachspiels (Handbook <b>of</b> <b>Chess),</b> the first comprehensive manual <b>of</b> <b>chess</b> theory.|$|E
5|$|Fischer heavily disparaged chess {{as it was}} {{currently}} being played (at the highest levels). As a result, on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fischer announced and advocated a variant <b>of</b> <b>chess</b> called Fischerandom Chess (later known as Chess960). The goal of Fischerandom Chess was {{to ensure that a}} game between two players is a contest between their understandings <b>of</b> <b>chess,</b> rather than their abilities to memorize opening lines or prepare opening strategies.|$|E

5|$|More recent {{research}} has focused on chess as mental training; the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search; brain imaging studies <b>of</b> <b>chess</b> masters and novices; blindfold chess; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models <b>of</b> <b>chess</b> expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development <b>of</b> <b>chess</b> and other domains of expertise has led to much {{recent research}}. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess. Recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important. For example, Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere {{are more likely to have}} been born in late winter and early spring. Compared to general population, chess players are more likely to be non-right-handed, though they found no correlation between handedness and skill.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{increasing}} {{concerns about the}} use <b>of</b> <b>chess</b> engines and outside communication, in 2014 FIDE banned all mobile phones from the playing area during chess competitions, under penalty of forfeiture of the game or even expulsion from the tournament. However, the rules also allow for less rigid enforcement in amateur events.|$|E
5|$|Fischer {{claimed that}} {{standard}} chess was stale {{and that he}} now played blitz games <b>of</b> <b>chess</b> variants, such as Chess960. He visited with the Polgár family in Budapest and analyzed many games with Judit, Zsuzsa, and Zsófia Polgár.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 FIDE {{added the}} variant Chess960 to the {{appendix}} of the Laws <b>of</b> <b>Chess.</b> Chess960 uses a random initial set-up of main pieces, with {{the conditions that}} the king is placed somewhere between the two rooks, and bishops on opposite-color squares.
