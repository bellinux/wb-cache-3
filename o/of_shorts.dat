5|$|Oobi is an American children's {{television}} series created by Josh Selig of Little Airplane Productions. It {{began as a}} series <b>of</b> <b>shorts</b> commissioned by the Noggin network during a three-year period in which all of the channel's programming was co-produced by Nickelodeon and Sesame Workshop. Full-length episodes of the show began airing on April 7, 2003, and the series ended its run on February 11, 2005.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of Snow White, work had continued on the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series <b>of</b> <b>shorts.</b> Mickey Mouse switched to Technicolor in 1935, by which time the series had added several major supporting characters, among them Mickey's dog Pluto and their friends Donald Duck and Goofy. Donald, Goofy, and Pluto would all be appearing in series of their own by 1940, and the Donald Duck cartoons eclipsed the Mickey Mouse series in popularity. The Silly Symphonies, which garnered seven , ended in 1939.|$|E

5|$|Lynch {{has also}} {{branched}} out into television, and later, internet-based series. His {{first foray into}} the medium was Twin Peaks, {{a joint venture with}} Mark Frost. Twin Peaks became a cult success, leading to Lynch and Frost working together on a number of other projects, including On the Air, and American Chronicles. In 2002 Lynch began producing two series <b>of</b> <b>shorts</b> released through his official website—the Flash-animated DumbLand, and Rabbits. Having begun acting in his 1972 short The Amputee, Lynch went on to appear on-camera in Twin Peaks, Zelly and Me and Dune. From 2007, Lynch has appeared in a recurring voice role in the animated series The Cleveland Show.|$|E
5|$|Despite Paramount's {{failure to}} build a {{national}} broadcast television network, the company retained KTLA, and executives at Paramount continued to toy {{with the idea of}} entering the television medium once more. Paramount sold its library <b>of</b> <b>shorts</b> and cartoons in separate deals to U.M. & M. TV Corporation, Associated Artists Productions and Harvey Comics (the Superman cartoons were already sold to National Comics when Paramount's license to Superman expired). In 1957, Paramount sold most of its pre-1950 sound live action feature film library to EMKA, Ltd., a subsidiary of MCA. The live action films would end up with what became Universal Television after MCA bought Universal Pictures in 1962. KTLA was eventually sold to Golden West Broadcasters, a company owned by actor and singer Gene Autry, for $12 million in 1964.|$|E
5|$|The promotional cinema {{poster for}} the film {{featured}} a woman holding a crossbow; she was photographed from behind, and her outfit left {{the bottom half of}} her buttocks exposed. The effect was achieved by having the model wear a pair of bikini bottoms backwards, so that the part seen on her backside is actually the front of the suit. The poster caused some furore—largely in the US—with The Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times considering the poster so unsuitable they edited out everything above the knee, whilst the Pittsburgh Press editors painted a pair <b>of</b> <b>shorts</b> over the legs. There was significant speculation as to the identity of the model before photographer Morgan Kane identified her as Joyce Bartle.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this bachelor thesis is to introduce the calculation of voltage and current ratios in asymmetrical short circuits. The {{first part of the}} thesis is focused on delineating the problem <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuits in general. It describes the causes <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuit arising, the types <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuits and their processes. The next part of the thesis shows the ways of calculating particular types <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuits, namely concentrating on the method of symmetrical components. The last part of the thesis is focused on the application of the discovered findings to calculate the ratios for the particular electric network. The calculation has been made for all the types <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuits, both symmetrical and asymmetrical. The resulting ratios are recorded into the phasor diagrams for particular types <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuits. The part of the calculation is also the recalculation of phase currents through a transformer...|$|R
5|$|My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy {{opens with}} a {{dedication}} to Daws Butler, a list of acknowledgements and a foreword from Cartwright's The Simpsons co-star Dan Castellaneta. The first chapter of the book details Cartwright's life and career prior to 1987. In the second chapter, Cartwright recalls the day she went to audition for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show. The shorts were about a dysfunctional family and Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the eldest daughter. Upon arriving at the audition, she found the role of her brother Bart to be much more interesting. Matt Groening, creator of the shorts, allowed her to audition for Bart, and gave her the job on the spot after hearing her reading. From there, the book contains her experiences as the voice of Bart. After three seasons <b>of</b> <b>shorts,</b> a half-hour spinoff called The Simpsons debuted in 1989. In the following chapters, she recalls the early days of The Simpsons, commenting on the recording process and her co-stars and revealing how she got the roles of some of the other characters she voices, including Nelson Muntz and Ralph Wiggum. In the 15th chapter, she discusses her experiences of voicing a famous character, but rarely being recognized.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper studies dynamic {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuit in the pulsed current {{gas metal arc}} welding (GMAW-P). Design/methodology/approach: Welding experiments with different values of pulsing parameter and simultaneous recording of high speed camera pictures and welding signals (such as current and voltage) were used to identify different short circuit conditions in GMAW-P. The investigation is based on the synchronization of welding signals and high speed camera to characterize different types <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuit occurring in GMAW-P system. The behaviour <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuit under the influence of different pulsing conditions is also investigated. Findings: It will be shown in the paper that short circuit in GMAW-P occurs in different forms which can be categorized depending upon time <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuit and phase (peak or base time) of the pulse. Further investigation involves study of the dynamic behaviour <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuit with variation of different pulsing parameters. Research limitations/implications: The results show that by varying the pulse parameters, behaviour <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuit in GMAW-P is changed. The pulse parameters can be adjusted to avoid occurrence <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuit in GMAW-P. Future work should concentrate on development of practical indices in terms of pulse welding parameters for quantitative estimation <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuit occurrence and avoidance. Originality/value: Determination of proper working parameters with GMAW-P is crucial for the appropriate selection of pulse welding parameters. As short-circuiting is common between the welding electrode and the workpiece in GMAW-P, so in order to estimate the working parameters and ensure stable GMAW-P understanding dynamic behaviour <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuit in GMAW-P will be useful. However, in case of aluminum hardly any attempt is made to analyse the dynamic behaviour <b>of</b> <b>short</b> circuit in GMAW-P. This paper analyses the short circuit phenomenon in GMAW-P and their behaviour with varying pulsing parameters...|$|R
