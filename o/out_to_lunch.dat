5|$|In her investigation, Leslie quickly learns Joe merely hits on {{any woman}} {{as long as}} she is not elderly. She takes Tom <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> to learn more about him. He {{responds}} to all of Leslie's questions with his usual chauvinistic answers, annoying her to the point that she admits she took him out because they matched on HoosierMate. A delighted Tom teases Leslie {{the rest of the day}} by pretending they are a couple, but she finally silences him by kissing him. Chris notices the kiss and warns Leslie that he has a strict policy against workplace dating.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) {{leaves his}} trailer for work, as he {{approaches}} a bear growling outside. He wants {{to move back to}} Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s house, but Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) insists that they must go forward in life. Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) brings her father, Thatcher Grey (Jeff Perry), who is vomiting blood, into the emergency room, and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) treats him. Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) admits an elderly patient, Irving Waller (Ralph Waite), with skin growths, who later reveals that he wants a penile prosthesis, to which he receives. It is revealed that Thatcher needs a liver transplantation, and Stevens is assigned to a cancerous patient, Randy (Jocko Sims), by Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) wants to ask the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) for a job as an attending surgeon, but is nervous that he will reject her, and goes <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> with her girlfriend Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw).|$|E

60|$|Douglas's {{first visit}} was to Rice, whom he dragged <b>out</b> with him <b>to</b> <b>lunch,</b> {{ordering}} such luxuries as were seldom asked for at Spargetti's. They lingered over their cigarettes and talked much. Yet about Rice {{there was a}} certain restraint, the more noticeable because of his host's gaiety. Douglas, well-dressed, debonair, with a flower in his buttonhole, and never a wrinkle upon his handsome face, was in no humour for reservations. He filled his companion's glass brimful of wine, and attacked him boldly.|$|R
25|$|In 1964, Dolphy {{signed with}} Blue Note Records and {{recorded}} <b>Out</b> <b>to</b> <b>Lunch!</b> with Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson, Richard Davis and Tony Williams. This album features Dolphy's fully developed avant-garde yet highly structured compositional style rooted in tradition. It is often considered his magnum opus.|$|E

He hosted the <b>Out</b> <b>to</b> <b>Lunch</b> series, where he cooked for celebrity guests, and Cooking with David Emanuel, lunch {{at his home in}} Windsor, Berkshire and Ladies who Lunch—a chat show over lunch. He also writes a weekly 'Style' column in the Western Mail, the national newspaper of Wales.|$|E
25|$|Dolphy's musical {{presence}} was influential to many young jazz musicians {{who would later}} become prominent. Dolphy worked intermittently with Ron Carter and Freddie Hubbard throughout his career, and in later years he hired Herbie Hancock, Bobby Hutcherson and Woody Shaw to work in his live and studio bands. <b>Out</b> <b>to</b> <b>Lunch!</b> featured yet another young performer, drummer Tony Williams, and Dolphy's participation on the Point of Departure session brought his influence into contact with up and coming tenor man Joe Henderson.|$|E
25|$|Wellham was {{involved}} in an incident at the Junction Oval in Melbourne when, after discussing with the Victorian Coach {{and on the way}} <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bat after <b>lunch,</b> that the coach should not stand next to the sight-screen during an over, in a Sheffield Shield match, he swiped his bat at the players gate. A piece of the gate broke off and injured a bystander. Wellham apologised for the incident.|$|R

50|$|Frost {{wrote the}} song {{when he was}} working with autistic {{children}} in his day job. He had gone <b>out</b> <b>to</b> get <b>lunch</b> at his local shop in the Sydney suburb of Asquith and saw a small boy not being noticed waiting at the counter. He was sufficiently moved by the vision to write the song. The song was rarely played live by the band; when it was, it was played in a modern country style. It would never have been recorded but their debut album's producer Charles Fisher heard Frost and Smith tinkering with the tune on the studio piano during a break in recording. Fisher suggested that Moving Pictures record the song. It was initially released as a single in January 1982.|$|R
25|$|He filed dispatches {{for many}} {{newspapers}} in Pakistan and abroad during his cricket commentating career, but he wrote most regularly for Dawn {{for a period}} spanning over 25 years.

His books include Black Moods, <b>Out</b> <b>to</b> <b>Lunch,</b> The System, The Other Side of Daylight, As Time Goes By and Once Upon a Time.|$|E
25|$|Dolphy's virtuoso {{instrumental}} {{abilities and}} unique style of jazz, deeply emotional and free but strongly rooted in tradition and structured composition, heavily influenced such musicians as Anthony Braxton, {{members of the}} Art Ensemble of Chicago, Oliver Lake, Julius Hemphill, Arthur Blythe, Aki Takase, Rudi Mahall, Don Byron and many others. Dolphy's compositions are the inspiration for many tribute albums, such as Oliver Lake's Prophet and Dedicated to Dolphy, Jerome Harris' Hidden In Plain View, Otomo Yoshihide's re-imagining of <b>Out</b> <b>to</b> <b>Lunch!,</b> Silke Eberhard's Potsa Lotsa: The Complete Works of Eric Dolphy, and Aki Takase and Rudi Mahall's duo album Duet For Eric Dolphy.|$|E

The production {{was held at the}} Wilshire Ebell Theatre and broadcast on YouTube {{to raise money for the}} American Foundation for Equal Rights. In September 2012, Clooney offered to take an auction winner <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> to benefit the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN).

60|$|Before {{the evening}} of that day Mr. Tolman became {{convinced}} that he would soon be obliged to employ a boy or some one {{to attend to the}} establishment during his absence. After breakfast, a woman recommended by the old lady came to make his bed and clean up generally, but when she had gone he was left alone with his shop. He determined not to allow this responsibility to injure his health, and so at one o'clock boldly locked the shop door and went <b>out</b> <b>to</b> his <b>lunch.</b> He hoped that no one would call during his absence, but when he returned he found a little girl with a pitcher standing at the door. She came to borrow half a pint of milk.|$|R

25|$|He went to St Bede's {{prep school}} in Eastbourne {{and then to}} Marlborough. He first played for the school team in 1962 under the {{captaincy}} of future Sussex Captain (1968–1972) {{and chairman of the}} MCC (2012–2013), Mike Griffith. The following year, after becoming captain of the school cricket XI, Martin-Jenkins wrote to Brian Johnston asking him how to become a cricket commentator. Johnston invited him to Broadcasting House, took him <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> and told him to develop his ability and review his performance by practising his commentating skills by using a tape recorder. That year he also scored a valiant 99 in Marlborough's second innings in the annual fixture against Rugby School at Lord's, but despite this they still lost by 22 runs.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{comic book}} writer Stan Lee as himself. In John Ortved's book , Lee {{stated that he}} attended the episode's table read, and {{was impressed with the}} size and quality of the creative staff, who all sat around the conference table. Lee recalled in 2009, [...] "Honestly, there was so much genuine talent around that table that you could have cut it with a knife." [...] Afterward, Lee met the writers of the show, and was pleasantly surprised to find that they were familiar with his work and he was with theirs. Afterward, executive producer Al Jean took Lee <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>lunch,</b> who he called [...] "one of the nicest and most unassuming guys you could hope to meet." [...] Lee continued, [...] "Of course, I probably said something wrong to him, or he didn't like my table manners, because I haven't been invited back for another guest shot. But hey one lives in hope." [...] The voice actor who plays Angry Dad in the episode was portrayed by Dan Castellaneta, who also does the voice for Homer among other characters in the series. The design of the character is also based on Castellaneta.|$|E

6000|$|... 'My uncle's great {{journey was}} {{in the fall of}} the leaf, at which time he {{collected}} debts, and took orders, in the north; going from London to Edinburgh, from Edinburgh to Glasgow, from Glasgow back to Edinburgh, and thence to London by the smack. You are to understand that his second visit to Edinburgh was for his own pleasure. He used to go back for a week, just to look up his old friends; and what with breakfasting with this one, lunching with that, dining with the third, and supping with another, a pretty tight week he used to make of it. I don't know whether any of you, gentlemen, ever partook of a real substantial hospitable Scotch breakfast, and then went <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a slight <b>lunch</b> of a bushel of oysters, a dozen or so of bottled ale, and a noggin or two of whiskey to close up with. If you ever did, you will agree with me that it requires a pretty strong head <b>to</b> go <b>out</b> <b>to</b> dinner and supper afterwards.|$|R
60|$|The {{afternoon}} at camp is perfect or otherwise, {{according to whether}} there is a four o'clock field-day or not. If there is, there are more manoeuvrings until tea-time, and the time is spent profitably, but not so pleasantly as it might be. If there is no field-day, you can take your time about your bathe in Cove Reservoir. And a really satisfactory bathe on a hot day should last at least three hours. Kennedy and Jimmy Silver strolled off {{in the direction of the}} Reservoir as soon as they felt that they had got over the effects of the beef, potatoes, and ginger-beer which a generous commissariat had doled <b>out</b> <b>to</b> them for <b>lunch.</b> It was a glorious day, and bathing was the only thing to do for the next hour or so. Stump-cricket, that fascinating sport much indulged in in camp, would not be at its best until the sun had cooled off a little.|$|R
60|$|They parted at the gates, {{an hour or}} so later.

Hubbard was described as [...] "the most brilliant trumpeter of a generation of musicians who stand with one foot in 'tonal' jazz and the other in the atonal camp". Though he never fully embraced the free jazz of the 1960s, he appeared on two of its landmark albums: Coleman's [...] and Coltrane's Ascension, as well as on Sonny Rollins' 1966 [...] "New Thing" [...] track [...] "East Broadway Run Down" [...] with Elvin Jones and Jimmy Garrison.|$|E

In a new preface to the 2011 E-book release of his 1974 memoir Chief!, he explained what he had kept to himself for four decades. With the tensions outside escalating, he had called Chief Inspector Michael Codd from the mosque and asked for two busloads of police cadets armed with nightsticks to keep order on the street outside. Codd refused and hung up. When Seedman called back {{he was told that}} Codd was <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>lunch.</b> That failure to support officers in the field had been the real reason for his retirement. He had kept it to himself since [...] "I loved the police department so much that I couldn't drag it through the dirt by saying what those bastards did." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1982, Olson {{was on her}} way to a New York City {{business}} meeting for her work as a marketing executive for Warner-Lambert (now Pfizer), where Olson developed promotional campaigns for consumer products. On impulse, Olson stopped outside Grand Central Terminal to buy a sandwich for a homeless woman she had noticed previously. As Olson handed the woman the sandwich and made to walk away, the woman held onto her hand to initiate conversation. Olson realized that the homeless woman wanted more than just a sandwich, that she wanted human interaction. She learned the woman's name was Millie, was once married and had two children. Through the conversation, Olson learned how homelessness can cause profound feelings of diminished self-worth and disconnection from society. The encounter motivated Olson and her sons <b>to</b> begin handing <b>out</b> bagged <b>lunches</b> <b>to</b> homeless people in the city.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the opening}} {{sequence}} of the first installment, the announcer says [...] "This {{is the story of}} two sisters – Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell". The Tates live in a wealthy neighborhood (the announcer calls it the neighborhood known as [...] "Rich"). Jessica Tate (Katherine Helmond) and her husband, Chester (Robert Mandan), are hardly models of fidelity, as their various love affairs result in several family mishaps, including the murder of her sister Mary's (Cathryn Damon) stepson, Peter Campbell (Robert Urich). Even though everyone tells Jessica about Chester's continual affairs, she does not believe them until she sees his philandering with her own eyes: while <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>lunch</b> with Mary, Jessica spots Chester necking with his secretary Claire (Kathryn Reynolds). Heartbroken, she sobs in her sister's arms. On later occasions, it becomes clear Jess has always known on some level about Chester's affairs but never allowed herself to process the information.|$|E
2500|$|After <b>Out</b> <b>to</b> <b>Lunch!</b> and an {{appearance}} on Andrew Hill's classic Point of Departure, Dolphy left for Europe with Charles Mingus' sextet in early 1964. Before a concert in Oslo, he informed Mingus {{that he planned to}} stay in Europe after their tour was finished, partly because he had become disillusioned with the United States' reception to musicians who were trying something new. Mingus then named the blues they had been performing [...] "So Long Eric". Dolphy intended to settle in Europe with his fiancée, Joyce Mordecai, who was working in the ballet scene in Paris. After leaving Mingus, he performed and recorded a few sides with various European bands, and American musicians living in Paris, such as Donald Byrd and Nathan Davis. The famous Last Date with Misha Mengelberg and Han Bennink was recorded in Hilversum, the Netherlands, though it was not actually Dolphy's last concert. Dolphy was also preparing to join Albert Ayler for a recording and spoke of his strong desire to play with Cecil Taylor. He also planned to form a band with Woody Shaw and Billy Higgins, and was writing a string quartet entitled [...] "Love Suite".|$|E
