5|$|Fragments of Him {{originally}} {{stemmed from}} an idea developed at a game jam called the Ludum Dare. The game originally had players removing objects while {{the main character}} {{became more and more}} depressed. Mata Haggis, one of the developers of Fragments of Him, told the Rock, Paper, Shotgun blog that in the final version there would be more mechanics than just removing objects. He said that there would be some choices to be made, and that the story would branch <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> from the choices. The prototype of the game focused only on the boyfriend, while the full version was to include four different character perspectives. He described the gameplay style as a mix of Heavy Rain and Gone Home. Haggis told Nathan Grayson of the Kotaku blog that many of the objects in the game, such as hotels and parks, were based on his real-life experiences of when he lost a friend.|$|E

25|$|The 2013 Big Ten season {{kicked off}} with the Purdue Boilermakers {{squaring}} {{off with the}} Wisconsin Badgers. Both teams started <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> slow as they exchanged punts on their first possessions. After another Purdue punt the Badgers took over at their own 5-yard line. Just 8 plays and 95 yards later, Wisconsin got on the board first with a RB Melvin Gordon 5-yard touchdown run. After another Boilermakers three-and-out, the Badgers struck again as RB James White scored on 70-yard touchdown run. At {{the end of the}} first quarter the Badgers led 14–0. Purdue then got on the board on a broken play where QB Rob Henry scrambled for a 22-yard touchdown run. On the next Wisconsin drive, QB Joel Stave's pass was intercepted by CB Ricardo Allen and returned to the Wisconsin 10-yard line. The Badgers defense was able to hold the Boilermakers to a field goal to make the score 14–10 Wisconsin. The Badgers then marched right down the field and scored on a Milevin Gordon 27-yard touchdown run. After another Purdue three-and-out, the Badgers again moved the ball with ease against the Boilermaker defense but stalled out and settled for a 32-yard field goal by K Kyle French. Wisconsin led 24–10 at the half.|$|E

[...] "I enjoy an action movie as much as the next person [...] it’s not something that I would like to do solely."

500|$|On September 18, the airmen woke up {{very early}} to make final preparations. A weather {{observation}} aircraft took off {{an hour before}} the first B-29 to report the latest meteorological conditions along the path ahead. Dumbo and Super Dumbo aircraft (B-17s and B-29s rigged for air-sea rescue) stood by, on alert. With the airfield lit by truck headlamps, Number 1 commanded by Giles was first to take <b>off,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> after 6:00 local time, as dawn began to glow in the east. Next, LeMay's ship took off at 6:15am, 4:15pm Eastern War Time in Washington, with Lieutenant Colonel Kingsbury at the throttles and First Lieutenant Potts at the controls. O'Donnell's Number 3 took off a few minutes later. The heavily loaded machines required every bit of the [...] concrete runway to get airborne—and some of the gravel beyond—reaching [...] before lifting from the ground. All three bombers were expected to be in Washington by 5pm the next day.|$|E
500|$|After a Week 8 bye, Hester caught four {{passes for}} 42 yards {{and had an}} 11-yard run against the Detroit Lions. He {{eventually}} lost his kick return duties to Danieal Manning, but began receiving more playing time as a wide receiver. Between Week 12 and 15, Hester caught 17 passes for 250 yards and one touchdown. David Haugh of the Chicago Tribune regarded Hester as the team's [...] "biggest threat in the passing game." [...] He concluded the season by catching 51 passes for a team high 665 yards. Unlike his previous two seasons in the NFL, Hester did not record a single touchdown return and only averaged 6.2 yards per punt return. Lovie Smith commented on Hester {{at the end of}} the season by saying, [...] "I know his returns dropped <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit this year, but his plate was full there for a while. We think we have a happy medium now for him as a punt returner and continuing to develop as a receiver." [...] Hester was also selected to play in the 2009 Pro Bowl as a third alternate.|$|E

500|$|The 1899 Australian tour saw Trumble score 1,183runs {{and take}} 142wickets; {{he was only}} the second Australian, after George Giffen, to score 1,000runs and take 100wickets in an English season {{as part of a}} touring team. In the Test series, Trumble took 15wickets at an average of 25.00 and made 232runs at an average of 38.66. [...] Wisden said of Trumble's batting that season, [...] " [...] played so {{consistently}} well as {{to make it clear that}} if he had not been a bowler he would have been a great batsman". Dry pitches saw his bowling average fall <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> from the 1896 tour but Wisden stated that he [...] "bowled quite as well as in 1896" [...] and [...] " [...] never seemed easy to hit, and whenever the ground gave him least advantage...he was deadly". Australia won the Second Test by 10wickets and with the other Tests finishing in draws, they retained the Ashes in a one Test to nil series victory. Trumble played particularly well in the Third Test at Headingley, where he took 5wickets for 60runs and was the highest run-scorer in the Australian second innings with 56. These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowler Rankings for the year 1899 (he retained it for the next 5 years).|$|E
500|$|According to Q magazine, Like a Virgin was {{the album}} that [...] "propelled [...] into the {{stratosphere}} – and rightly so. The songs are smart, funny, sexy and irresistible." [...] Taraborrelli said, [...] "It was Like a Virgin which reflected Madonna as a more versatile and artistic performer and vocals on this album being reflectively sharper in contrast to her early works in the music industry." [...] Michael Paoletta from Billboard commented that the songs on the album sustain a [...] "fevered dance-rock momentum". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic commented, [...] "Overall, the album adds up to less {{than the sum of}} its parts—partially because the singles are so good, but also because on the first album, she stunned with style and a certain joy. Here, the calculation is apparent, and while that's part of Madonna's essence—even something that makes her fun—it throws the record's balance <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too much for it to be consistent, even if it justifiably made her a star." [...] Debby Miller from Rolling Stone preferred Madonna's debut album over Like a Virgin. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau was also lukewarm towards the record, writing [...] " [...] so sure of herself she's asking men and women both to get the hots for the calculating bitch who sells the fantasy even while she bids for the sincerity market where long-term superstars ply their trade. And to make the music less mechanical, she's hired Nile Rodgers, who I won't blame for making it less catchy." ...|$|E
500|$|Kira Schlechter in The Patriot-News {{declares}} [...] "The Body" [...] "one of {{the finest}} episodes of any series ever", stating that the silence and novel cinematography are [...] "remarkable and the writing is brilliant". Buffy and Dawn's conversation at her school, Schlechter says, is [...] "positively wrenching". When the series ended in 2003, Amy Antangelo in the Boston Herald and Siona LaFrance of the New Orleans Times-Picayune both rated the best Buffy episodes giving [...] "The Body" [...] equal billing at the top with [...] "Hush" [...] and [...] "Once More, with Feeling", LaFrance designating the episode an [...] "instant classic". Jonathan Last in The Weekly Standard lists [...] "The Body" [...] eighth out of the ten best Buffy episodes, writing that it is [...] "the series' most difficult episode because it's real—and not real in the way ER or The Practice or Law & Order, all hyper-versions of reality, are real. At some point, {{most of us will}} experience a day like Buffy has in 'The Body' and we sense that the writers have gotten nearly every detail of that day—right down to the absence of a musical score—right." [...] In the A.V. Club, Noel Murray also finds small details compelling, such as the camera's focus on the paper towel Buffy uses to cover the vomit on the carpet. He does, however, write that some of the shots [...] "come <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gimmicky, but the ones that work are so effective that it seems petty to complain that Whedon overdoes it at times.

In [...] "Pawnee Rangers", Chris meets Jerry's daughter Millicent (Sarah Wright). The two start dating and Chris makes {{sure that it is}} okay with Jerry. Jerry says that he is fine with the two of them dating, much to Chris' delight. Chris and Millicent go together to April and Andy's Halloween party, with Chris dressing as Sherlock Holmes, his favorite character. [...] After Chris starts to lose contact with Millie, he enlists Jerry, Donna, and Ann to help him, against Jerry's wishes. Ann tells him that he is too accessible and needs to back <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit so he can continue dating Millie. In [...] "Bowling for Votes", Millie dumps Chris, leaving him depressed.

[...] In the same episode, when Andy, asks Chris to sing for him (since he is working as a backing vocalist on Andy's song for the campaign), he sings [...] "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" [...] out of tune and with the wrong lyrics, causing everyone else there to wince. Chris helps Leslie's campaign however he can, even taking on a large amount of busy work to distract him from his loneliness [...] "Bus Tour".

2500|$|Details {{regarding}} the album were sparse; {{completion of the}} album was announced via a blog post on 8 July 2006. While the record was in the writing and recording stages, some band members were based in New York City and others in Los Angeles. Aaron Turner later confessed that the album [...] "suffered" [...] due to this situation. Jeff Caxide also felt discontent and dissatisfaction with the album, stating that In the Absence of Truth was “the kind of record I listen to and think ‘that could be better, {{and that could be}} better, and that could be better,’ and I think we all kind of felt that way”. Drummer Aaron Harris felt that the band pushed themselves too far musically, too; having learned a wealth of new techniques prior to its recording, he says he “grew so much as a drummer [...] that it was overwhelming even for me.” He continues: “I think I was trying to show <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit [...] I think everybody was.” The eventual record proved dissatisfactory, with him opining that “some of it sounded a bit jumbled. I think a lot of things were happening that we didn't know what to do with.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Neptune {{entered the}} battle about 25 {{minutes after the}} start of the action, having by then drifted to leeward and fallen astern of Redoutable.

Maistral hailed San Justo The San Justo not being in her station and edging down to place herself on my windward beam hampered me; I at once hailed her to enquire if she knew her station; I told her that mine was to be next astern to the Bucentaure; she replied that she was about to place herself astern of me, which she did not do, and continued to the wind and to fore-reach on me, which made me fall <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> to leeward and to draw away from the flagship, of whom I had been within hail in the first place. San Justos captain, Francisco Javier Garstón, blamed the crew's inexperience for failing to keep her station. This would be significant in the coming battle as the position astern of the flagship would be the focus of British attention, and should have been occupied by a powerful ship like the Neptune. Meanwhile, the ship that should have been astern of Neptune, the Spanish 64-gun San Leandro, was following San Justo to leeward, leaving a considerable gap behind the flagship that the British could exploit. Redoutables captain, Jean Jacques Étienne Lucas, saw the threat, and brought his ship forward in an attempt to close the gap. Despite his efforts, the British were able to break the line between Bucentaure and Redoubtable.|$|E
