40|$|The {{surge of}} {{interest}} in <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers has sparked a debate over its motivations. However, most of the academic {{research has focused on}} developed economies; and similar to many other countries, empirical research is scarce in Malaysia too.

It employs logit regression analysis in which the data is collected by means of questionnaires from October to December 2012. This research discovers that exchange motive is more prevailing than altruism motive among the respondents. More <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers are given to daughters, children who provide more services and children with low opportunity cost of their time.

The majority of private income transfers occur <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> (i. e., between living persons), but very {{little is known about}} this type of transfer behavior. This paper tests alternative hypotheses concerning motivation for <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers. Two motives are considered: altruism and exchange.

40|$|Empirical work on intergenerational {{transfers}} {{has focused}} on distinguishing between altruistic and exchange motivated behavior. However, these two models are unable to explain the strong tendency for estates to be divided equally across children, while <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers are made unequally. This paper presents a new framework for analyzing transfers from parents to children that is more consistent with observed behavior than are the altruistic and exchange models alone. In particular the model developed here allows for differing behavior with respect to <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers and bequests due to uncertainty about the recipient's permanent income. The empirical work uses data from the Health and Retirement Survey and the Asset and Health Dynamics Survey. The patterns observed in these data are consistent with earlier findings that <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers go disproportionately to less well-off children, while bequests are divided equally across children. Further, the results support the prediction of the model in that differences in <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers arise from differences in current income, while bequests are unequal when the children's permanent incomes are different. ...|$|R

In presence of a very low <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> gift tax, Italian families found it benecial to redistribute properties among their members. Dierence-in-dierence estimates indicate that property tax reform increased the probability that high-wealth donors made an <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> property gift by 3 percentage points and the size transferred by 4 square meters relative to less wealthy donors.

40|$|Taxpayers are {{considerably}} interested in tax planning for intergenerational transfers (<b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> gifts and bequests) that minimize {{the payment of}} taxes. Nordblom and Ohlsson (2006) demonstrated that (1) altruistic parents avoid tax payment by changing the timing of transfers when <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> gifts are taxed differently from bequests and (2) tax avoidance ceases to exist if bequests and gifts from the same donor are jointly taxed. This paper aims to demonstrate that if the wealth management/investment behavior of the parent is taken into consideration, tax avoidance will persist even when gifts and bequests are jointly taxed. This is because parents dislike missing an opportunity to gain investment returns from the payment of taxes on gifts that exceed the exemption level.

There are three major findings. First, capital gains are the major factor explaining overall wealth changes and account for three-fourths of the simulated growth in wealth over the entire period, while savings account for the other quarter. Second, for cohorts under age 50, <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers dominate observed changes in wealth. Indeed, the oldest age groups appear to have transferred sizable amounts of their wealth to younger generations <b>inter</b> <b>vivos,</b> raising the wealth of these younger groups substantially above {{what it would be}} based on saving alone.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the current estate and gift tax rules {{that apply to}} intergenerational transfers in the United States. It summarizes the incentives for <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> giving as a strategy for reducing estate tax liability. It shows that {{the current level of}} intergenerational transfers is much lower than the level that would be implied by simple models of dynastic utility maximization. Moreover, it demonstrates that even among elderly households with net worth in excess of $ 2. 5 million, roughly four times the net worth at which the estate tax takes effect, only about forty-five percent take advantage of the opportunity for tax-free <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> giving. Cross-sectional regressions using the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances suggest that transfers rise with household net worth, possibly reflecting the impact of progressive estate taxes. In addition, households with a preponderance of their net worth in illiquid forms, such as a private business, are less likely to make transfers than their equally wealthy counterparts with more liquid wealth. Households with substantial unrealized capital gains, for whom the benefits of capital asset basis step-up at death are greatest, are less likely to make large <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> transfers than similarly wealthy households with higher basis assets. Nevertheless, the aggregate flow of intergenerational transfers is much smaller than the level that would result if all households that were likely to face the estate tax attempted to transfer resources through <b>inter</b> <b>vivos</b> gifts. ...|$|R

However, subsample analysis of young home buyers indicates that the empirical results are consistent with the literature: children who receive parental gifts tend to purchase a higher-priced dwelling. One potential explanation is that relatively young adult children are less likely to take charge of care obligations, and accordingly, parental gifts are only expected to relax their liquidity constraints.
