5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 October 1916, a fire was {{discovered}} in the Imperatritsa Mariyas forward powder magazine while at anchor in Sevastopol, but it exploded before any efforts {{could be made to}} fight the fire. Sailors led by Engineer-Mechanic Midshipman Ignatyev, however, managed to flood the forward shell magazine before the explosion at the cost <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives.</b> Their action probably prevented a catastrophic detonation {{and all of the other}} magazines were flooded as a precaution. About forty minutes after the first explosion, a second occurred in the vicinity of the torpedo compartment that destroyed the watertight integrity of the rest of the forward bulkheads. Imperatritsa Mariya began to sink by the bow and listed to starboard. She capsized a few minutes later, taking 228 sailors with her. The subsequent investigation determined that the explosion was probably the result of spontaneous combustion of the nitrocellulose-based propellant as it decomposed.|$|E

25|$|Cardinal: The {{cardinal}} {{signs are}} Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. A native with mainly cardinal signs will {{not want to}} be held under anybody's thumb, and will need to take charge of their own world. Their attention may be concerned with themselves or others, but wherever their energies are directed it is difficult to deflect them from their chosen course. Cardinal signs in a chart will add courage, initiative and self-motivation. Cardinal subjects are hard to influence because they generally believe they know best. A subject lacking cardinal signs may feel they are never in control <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives,</b> but are manipulated by people and circumstances beyond their control. They may lack courage and initiative and may prefer others to make decisions for them. Planets in the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses, and an emphasis on fire and air signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

Their initial {{training}} programs focused on helping women develop invaluable life skills in business, health and leadership.

50|$|Live at the El Mocambo is {{the second}} live album by the Canadian rock band April Wine, {{released}} in 1977. It was recorded during a performance at Toronto's El Mocambo club on 4 and 5 March 1977 when April Wine opened for the Rolling Stones {{during one of the}} surprise club appearances for which the Stones are renowned, and during which they recorded part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>live</b> album Love You Live (1977). Live at the El Mocambo was produced and engineered by Eddie Kramer, best known for his work with the Stones, Jimi Hendrix, and Led Zeppelin. Partly owing to Kramer's input, the album features a somewhat more raw-sounding April Wine than most fans are used to from the band's more conventionally produced studio albums. Among April Wine's many albums, Live at the El Mocambo has tended to be overshadowed by the more commercially successful Harder, Faster (1979) and The Nature of the Beast (1981). It was released on CD in March, 2010 on Unidisc.|$|R
