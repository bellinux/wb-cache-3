5|$|A {{recurring}} {{horror story}} on many websites and popular media outlets is that Japanese soldiers during World War II inflicted bamboo torture upon prisoners of war. The victim was supposedly tied securely in place above a young bamboo shoot. Over several days, the sharp, fast growing shoot would first puncture, then completely penetrate the victim's body, eventually emerging {{through the other}} side. Possibility <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>method</b> was tested on an episode of MythBusters, and confirmed.|$|E

The South African Russell Endean became the first victim <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>method</b> in international cricket when he was dismissed in a 1957 Test match against England. The final occurrence was in an ODI in 2015, when Chamu Chibhabha of Zimbabwe was given out against Afghanistan.|$|E

In this method, alcohol is fermented to vinegar in a continuously stirred tank, and oxygen is supplied by bubbling air through the solution.

5|$|One {{alternative}} was the turbo-electric drive where the steam turbine generated electrical power which then drove the propellers. This was particularly favoured by the US Navy, which {{used it for}} all dreadnoughts from late 1915–1922. The advantages <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>method</b> were its low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. The disadvantages were that the machinery was heavy and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the electrics.|$|E
5|$|The major {{advantage}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>method</b> over {{addition of}} organometallic reagents to more typical acyl compounds {{is that it}} avoids the common problem of over-addition. For these latter reactions, two equivalents of the incoming group add to form an alcohol rather than a ketone or aldehyde. This occurs even if the equivalents of nucleophile are closely controlled.|$|E
5|$|Dolphin drive hunting, {{also called}} dolphin drive fishing, {{is a method}} of hunting {{dolphins}} and occasionally other small cetaceans by driving them together with boats and then usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the open sea or ocean with boats and nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>method.</b> By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their meat; some end up in dolphinariums.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP {{is a part of}} red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, use <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>method</b> for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{blurring}} and thresholding, {{this method}} can alternatively {{be described as}} applying a median filter with Gaussian weights to each pixel. It is possible to use kernels other than the heat kernel, or to adaptively refine the grid so that it has high resolution near the curve but does not waste time and memory on pixels far from the curve that do {{not contribute to the}} outcome. Instead of using only the two values in the pixelated image, a version <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>method</b> that uses an image whose pixel values represent the signed distance to the curve can achieve subpixel accuracy and require lower resolution.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{and other}} smaller cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are hunted in an {{activity}} known as drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Porpoises are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>method.</b> By numbers, porpoises are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the high methylmercury levels impose, thousands of porpoises are caught in drive hunts each year.|$|E
