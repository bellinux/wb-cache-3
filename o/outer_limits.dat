5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} the Sun at about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU.

The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the Kuiper belt, but its <b>outer</b> <b>limits</b> reach much further away from the Sun and further {{above and below the}} ecliptic than the Kuiper belt proper.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the episode was a direct {{reference}} to the namesake in Greek mythology, with Erickson taking the Daedalus while his son relates to Icarus.

25|$|Because {{ordering}} is by set inclusion, {{then the}} <b>outer</b> <b>limit</b> will always contain the inner limit (i.e., limnbsp&infnbsp&X'n ⊆ limnbsp&supnbsp&X'n).

5|$|Tobe Hooper, then {{preparing}} both Invaders From Mars and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, was mooted as director. Golan and Globus misunderstood {{the concept}} of the character ("They thought it was like The Wolf Man", said director Joseph Zito) and instructed writer Leslie Stevens, creator of The <b>Outer</b> <b>Limits,</b> to write a treatment reflecting their misconception. In Stevens' story, a corporate scientist intentionally subjects ID-badge photographer Peter Parker to radioactive bombardment, transforming him into a hairy, suicidal, eight-armed monster. This human tarantula refuses to join the scientist’s new master-race of mutants, battling a succession of mutations kept in a basement laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Cameron {{returned}} to Pomona, California and {{stayed at the}} home of science fiction writer Randall Frakes, where he wrote the draft for The Terminator. Cameron's influences included 1950s science fiction films, the 1960s fantasy television series The <b>Outer</b> <b>Limits,</b> and contemporary films such as The Driver (1978) and Mad Max 2 (1981). To translate the draft into a script, Cameron enlisted his friend Bill Wisher, who had a similar approach to storytelling. Cameron gave Wisher scenes involving Sarah Connor and the police department to write. As Wisher lived far from Cameron, the two communicated ideas by recording tapes of what they wrote by telephone. Frakes and Wisher would later write the US-released novelization of the movie.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study local error bound moduli for a locally Lipschitz and regular {{function}} via its <b>outer</b> <b>limiting</b> subdifferential set. We {{show that the}} distance of 0 from the <b>outer</b> <b>limiting</b> subdifferential of the support function of the subdifferential set, which is essentially the distance of 0 from the end set of the subdifferential set, is an upper estimate of the local error bound modulus. This upper estimate becomes tight for a convex function under some regularity conditions. We show that the distance of 0 from the <b>outer</b> <b>limiting</b> subdifferential set of a lower C^ 1 function {{is equal to the}} local error bound modulus. Comment: 26 page...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} the cellular context of neuronal differentiation in the vertebrate retina, we analyzed {{the behavior of}} a class of progenitor cells in the outer nuclear layer of the teleost retina which divide throughout the animal's life and generate only rod photoreceptors. We present evidence that these progenitors reside adjacent to the <b>outer</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane of the retina during all phases of cell cycle. After final cell division, postmitotic cells move inward, toward the vitreal boundary of the outer nuclear layer, before they give rise to new rods. This movement is remarkable because it occurs in the mature, functioning retina. We hypothesize that only one of the two progenitor daughter cells moves while the other remains adjacent to the <b>outer</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane to divide again...|$|R
