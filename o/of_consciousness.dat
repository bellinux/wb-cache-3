5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> This category generally includes minimally conscious state and persistent vegetative state, but sometimes {{also includes the}} less severe locked-in syndrome and more severe chronic coma. Differential diagnosis of these disorders is an active area of biomedical research. Finally, brain death results in an irreversible disruption <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> While other conditions may cause a moderate deterioration (e.g., dementia and delirium) or transient interruption (e.g., grand mal and petit mal seizures) <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> they {{are not included in}} this category.|$|E
5|$|Opinions {{are divided}} {{as to where}} in {{biological}} evolution consciousness emerged and {{about whether or not}} consciousness has any survival value. It has been argued that consciousness emerged (i) exclusively with the first humans, (ii) exclusively with the first mammals, (iii) independently in mammals and birds, or (iv) with the first reptiles. Other authors date the origins <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> to the first animals with nervous systems or early vertebrates in the Cambrian over 500 million years ago. Donald Griffin suggests in his book Animal Minds a gradual evolution <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Each of these scenarios raises the question of the possible survival value <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b>|$|E

5|$|Concussion, {{also known}} as minor head trauma or mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) {{is the most common}} type of traumatic brain injury. It is typically defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function. Symptoms include a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, which may not be recognized if subtle. A variety of signs accompany concussion including headache, feeling in a fog, and emotional changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> or amnesia), behavioral changes (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances. Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, {{although}} no structural brain damage occurs {{according to the}} classic definition, some researchers have included injuries in which structural damage has occurred and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence definition includes physiological or physical disruption in the brain's synapses. Also, by definition, concussion has historically involved a loss <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> However, the definition has evolved over time to include a change in consciousness, such as amnesia, although controversy continues about whether the definition should include only those injuries in which loss <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> occurs.|$|E

5|$|In the Balkand {{episode of}} the {{marriage}} of the princes of Ayodhya with the princesses of Mithila, Tulsidas presents a metaphor in which the four brides are compared with the four states <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> – the waking state (Jagrat), sleep with dreams (Swapna), dreamless sleep (Sushupti) and the fourth self-conscious state (Turiya). The four grooms are compared with the presiding divinity (Vibhu) of the four states – Vishva, Taijasa, Prajna and Brahman.

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} <b>of</b> African <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> {{reality is}} one of the central, and in some ways, most familiar concepts in African <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> reality. The most fundamental questions about it are; what and why is it? These questions have rarely been answered directly. Numerous works have portrayed or stated either directly or indirectly on the variety <b>of</b> African <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> reality. Others have argued, for various properties <b>of</b> a <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> reality that should have. While, still others, have focused on properties that are important to the notion <b>of</b> human person <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> reality in general. This work referred back to basics, to address the question directly. The researcher argued and believed that, the answer can best be understood in terms of exploration and investigation on African <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> reality, with the aim of propagating the reflection of it. The study therefore aimed at the emerging of a concept(s) or hypothesis or a theory, which proceeds after transcendence, and {{goes hand in hand with}} the initiated transcendence. The transcendence <b>of</b> African <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> reality was assumed as the ongoing process of refining the African <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> reality through life and further research. The researcher considered the idea of reconstruction <b>of</b> African <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> reality in a suggestive and conventional way as that which could let an African person to utilize properly his or her intellect and will. This utilization, as the researcher argues, sustains the inward and outward countenance that produces the proper state of mind within the self and in others. Researcher’s prior knowledge helped the emergency of the preliminary conception of the study which was carried on by further research conducted by survey - case study under the projection of analogical sense to various entities, processes or issues used in this study...|$|R
5|$|Research {{conducted}} {{on the effects of}} partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E

5|$|A few {{theoretical}} physicists {{have argued}} that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel could falsify proposals {{such as those of}} Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement in protein. At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.|$|E
