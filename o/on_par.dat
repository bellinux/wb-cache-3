This has remained the standard and has never been achieved by a professional golfer in a professional event.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, Ohio Wesleyan {{had added}} a School of Music (1877), School of Fine Arts (1877), School of Oratory (1894), and Business School (1895) to the {{original}} College of Liberal Arts (founded in 1844). To address the need for new departments and specialized instruction, the administration improved the facilities and courses to make them <b>on</b> <b>par</b> with OWU's new academic position.

In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity is viewed {{as a consequence of the}} geometry of spacetime.|$|E
50|$|PARs are {{activated}} by {{the action of}} serine proteases such as thrombin (acts <b>on</b> <b>PARs</b> 1, 3 and 4) and trypsin (PAR 2). These enzymes cleave the N-terminus of the receptor, which in turn acts as a tethered ligand. In the cleaved state, part of the receptor itself acts as the agonist, causing a physiological response.|$|R

The only important nitrogen minerals are nitre (potassium nitrate, saltpetre) and sodanitre (sodium nitrate, Chilean saltpetre). However, these have not been an important source of nitrates since the 1920s, when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common.|$|E
