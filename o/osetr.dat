The boats were designed by American Engineer Simon Lake and had wheels fitted for moving around on the sea bed as well as wet/dry chambers for divers. The <b>Osetr</b> was the former Protector sold by Lake to the Russians and re-assembeld in Russia. The diving depth was 16 fathoms.|$|E

Protector was the first submarine to have diving planes mounted forward of the conning tower and a flat keel. Four diving planes allowed Protector to maintain depth without changing ballast tank levels, and to dive level without a down-angle. Level diving was a feature of several subsequent Lake designs, notably the first three US G-class submarines. Protector also had a lock-out chamber for divers to leave the submarine. Lake, lacking Holland's financial backing, was unable to continue building submarines in the United States. He sold Protector to Imperial Russia in 1904 as the <b>Osetr</b> {{and spent the next}} seven years in Europe designing submarines for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, Germany's Kaiserliche Marine, and the Imperial Russian Navy (Osetr- and Kaiman-class submarines).|$|E

Gorkiy and survey vessel <b>Osetr,</b> took sediment samples in the Kara Sea {{in addition to}} other oceanographic work. The investigations of sediments composition was compared with biological and hydrological data obtained in the same areas. The sediments sampled were subjected to mechanical, mineralogical, chemical and faunistic analyses. During this survey iron-manganese concretions were recovered...|$|E
