Fifteen {{interviews were conducted with}} executives of eight main contracting firms in Australia. The research found that the subcontractors were chosen mainly through selective or <b>open</b> <b>tendering</b> using the criteria of &# 8220;past performance, technical capability, reputation, financial stability, experience on similar work and lowest price&# 8221;. With regard to long-term relationship, the research found the main motivation is &# 8220;to achieve organisational competitive advantages&# 8221;, and the key successful elements include &# 8220;trusting behaviour, honesty, open communication and top management commitment&# 8221;, while the proactive strategies to achieve the long-term relationship include &# 8220;organise regular meetings, provide incentive financial scheme, maintain constant contacts, provide project programming ownership and provide structured and detail documentation&# 8221;. It is concluded that, with the aim of enhancing organisational competitive advantage, while selective and <b>open</b> <b>tendering</b> are the main means for subcontractor selection, the main contractors understand the importance and key successful elements of long-term relationship with their subcontractors and they have adopted some strategies to develop and maintain the long-term relationships...|$|R
