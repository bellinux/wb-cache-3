Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures.

30|$|First of all, the {{question}} <b>of</b> what is <b>accounting</b> {{is the most}} important issue during the early stage period. Some literature summarize the definition <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> as the following four concepts: management tool, management activity, art, and information system based on definitions in both domestic and foreign materials including textbooks, encyclopedias, literature, and reports <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> associations. Zhou (1988) briefly introduces the Chinese accounting system, relating the nature <b>of</b> the Chinese <b>accounting</b> system to the specific socio-economic context in China. Subsequently, Wu (1996) argues that accounting is used to reflect firm stewardship and defines accounting as an economic control system which aims at affirming and measuring accountability with monetary measurement. However, Zhao (1995 b) summarizes the objective <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> as the integration of accountability and decision availability. Huang (1997 b) notes that the debate about accounting objectives is meaningless if the function <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> is neglected. He considers recording and supervision to be the functions <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> and that discussions of the objective <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> should be restricted to the functions <b>of</b> <b>accounting.</b> Moreover, one article explores the essence and content <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> culture. He defines accounting culture as accounting ideology, its corresponding system, and implementation, whereas the content <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> includes accounting values, accounting ethics, and accounting law.|$|R

These include materials from an annal kept at the monastery of Iona in Scotland. Óengus and the Picts appear occasionally in Welsh sources, such as the Annales Cambriae, and more frequently in Northumbrian sources, of which the Continuation of Bede's chronicle and the Historia Regum Anglorum attributed to Symeon of Durham are the most important.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the late}} 12th century chronicler Roger of Howden, the main source for {{information}} on the 1198 carucage, assessments were carried out in county by a commission of two royal officials working in each hundred (a subdivision of a county). Each of these commissions included two local knights who would take sworn testimonies in each village from four villagers and the bailiffs or estate officials of those barons holding land in the village. The resulting assessments were recorded, and the sheriff, or chief royal official of the county, would receive the money and forward it to the treasury. Estate holders in the area were responsible for the payments from their estates, and when they were handed to the Exchequer a special procedure was followed to record the payments, which were then deposited into a dedicated set <b>of</b> <b>accounts.</b> These elaborate procedures were probably meant to avoid misappropriation of funds, but may not have been successful, as justices were later sent out to inquire into the commissioners' activities. As a result of their investigations, 23counties paid fines to secure an end to royal inquiries and any arrears in payments.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the railway}} was finally {{completed}} in 1840, and in July the Preston and Wyre Railway opened.

Also in 1841, the North Euston {{was the fourth}} hotel {{to open in the}} town. Steamer services opened to the Isle of Man, Whitehaven, Ardrossan and Belfast. Fleetwood initially flourished, but Hesketh-Fleetwood had run out of money and was compelled to take out mortgages. He lost the £75,000 he had invested in the Preston and Wyre Railway Company owing to a lack <b>of</b> <b>accounts.</b> Kemp claimed that Hesketh-Fleetwood owed him money, but Kemp refused to explain his book-keeping. In the face of enormous debts Hesketh-Fleetwood sold his estates at Blackpool, Southport, Meols Hall, and Tulketh Hall. Charles bought the Churchtown estate, where {{he and his wife had}} been living, from his brother. In 1844 Hesketh-Fleetwood auctioned off his personal possessions from Rossall Hall and left Lancashire. The Rev. St. Vincent Beechey had set up the Northern Church of England School for boys. Close to bankruptcy, Hesketh-Fleetwood leased the buildings at Rossall Hall to the school for six years, with the option to buy it after nine for £7,000. Thereafter, the school was called Rossall School.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Man {{marked the}} first {{discovery}} in Britain of a well-preserved bog body; its condition was {{comparable to that of}} Grauballe Man and Tollund Man from Denmark. Before Lindow Man was found, it was estimated that 41bog bodies had been found in England and Wales and 15 in Scotland.

Prior to the discovery of the bodies in Lindow Moss, British bog bodies had been a relatively neglected subject compared to European examples. The interest caused by Lindow Man led to more in-depth research <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> of discoveries in bogs since the 17thcentury; by 1995, the numbers had changed to 106 in England and Wales and 34 in Scotland.

5|$|The Lords {{would only}} be able to delay money bills for one month, {{effectively}} ending their ability to do so. These were defined as any public bill which contained only provisions dealing with the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on the Consolidated Fund, or on money provided by Parliament, or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> of public money; and the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof. It did not however, cover any sort of local taxes or similar measures. Some Finance Bills have not fallen within this criterion; Consolidated Fund and Appropriation Bills have. The Speaker of the House of Commons would have to certify that a bill was a money bill, endorsing it with a Speaker's certificate. The Local Government Finance Bill 1988, which introduced the Community Charge ("Poll Tax"), was not certified as a Money Bill and was therefore considered by the Lords. Whilst Finance Bills are not considered Money Bills, convention dictates that those parts of a Finance Bill dealing with taxation or expenditure (which, if in an Act alone, would constitute a Money Bill) are not questioned.|$|E
