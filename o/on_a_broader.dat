5|$|With the {{exception}} of A.laevigatum, all species have a thin separating layer, the cortex, between the hymenium and the tomentum. A cortex is also present on many Stereum fungi (<b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> front) and serves to bend up the fruit body. As this cortex is missing on A.laevigatum, its fruit body lies flat on the bark.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{significant}} events occurred around 42 Ma, including cessation of metamorphism of the Leech River Schists (resulting from the Metchosin/Crescent Formation being thrust under Vancouver Island) {{and the end}} of strike-slip motion on the Straight Creek Fault; these may reflect the last movement of Siletzia relative to North America. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> scale, there was a change in absolute direction of the Pacific plate (marked {{by the end of the}} bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain), and a change in the convergence of the Kula plate with the North American plate.|$|E

The first major change to the product base was a reformulation and name change of the company's chicken nuggets in January 2013. Along with other new products such as smoothies, wraps and chicken strips that broadly copied McDonald's menu once again, the chain reintroduced the Big King as a permanent menu item in November of the same year.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of officially {{recognized}} diagnostic criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians {{to refer to a}} broader set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship. Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.|$|E
5|$|McCarthyism {{has taken}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> meaning, {{describing}} {{the excesses of}} similar efforts. The term is also now used more generally to describe reckless, unsubstantiated accusations, as well as demagogic attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries. During the McCarthy era, hundreds of Americans were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers and {{became the subject of}} aggressive investigations and questioning before government or private-industry panels, committees and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, educators and labor union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person's real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was sometimes exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of employment or destruction of their careers; some even suffered imprisonment. Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts later overturned, laws that were later declared unconstitutional, dismissals for reasons later declared illegal or actionable, or extra-legal procedures that would come into general disrepute.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Recession in 2008–2009, this narrowly-defined demographic-based sales plan faltered and sales and profits for the chain declined; Burger King's same-store {{comparable}} sales in the United States and Canada declined 4.6% in the three months ended September 30, while McDonald's posted same-store comparable sales growth of 2.5% within the United States. The Stacker line underwent a minor reformulation in 2011 that involved deleting the top layer of cheese and changing the amount of bacon in the sandwiches, and moving the sandwiches from the core section of its menu to the company's value menu. The changed ingredient list and pricing structure created a situation such that the distribution of ingredients did not scale {{at the same rate as}} increasing numbers of burger patties. Consumer Reports' blog The Consumerist noted that two single Stackers at $1.00 included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for $2.00. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker. The Stacker line and other related calorie-heavy menu items were dropped in 2012 when 3G Capital of Brazil bought the company and initiated a menu restructuring focusing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> demographic base.|$|E

A seventh Starz multiplex channel was launched in 2004: Starz! Kids was created as a movie service featuring films aimed at children between 2 and 11 years of age, maintaining a format {{similar to that of}} Starz! Family. Unlike the other Starz multiplex channels, Starz! Kids was launched on cable systems on a case-by-case basis instead of <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> national scale.|$|E
25|$|<b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> front, {{the economy}} {{initially}} recovered {{at a brisk}} pace from the 1973–75 recession. Incoming president Jimmy Carter instituted a large fiscal stimulus package in 1977 in order to boost the economy. However, inflation began a steep rise beginning in late 1978, and rose by double digits following the 1979 energy crisis. In order to combat inflation, Carter appointed Paul Volcker to the Federal Reserve, who raised interest rates and caused a sharp recession {{in the first six}} months of 1980. In March 1980, Carter introduced his own policies for reducing inflation, and the Federal Reserve brought down interest rates to cooperate with the initiatives.|$|E
25|$|The article {{pointed out}} that while this {{movement}} had roots {{in the philosophy of}} Friedrich Nietzsche, it also drew <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> range of thinkers. For example, philosophers and theologians like Søren Kierkegaard and Dietrich Bonhoeffer expressed concerns about the role of God in an increasingly secularised world. The immediate reality did not indicate a death of God or religion; Pope John XXIII's Second Vatican Council had done much to revitalize the Roman Catholic Church, while in the United States, as many as 97% declared a belief in God. Evangelical ministers such as Billy Graham and Christian artists like the playwright William Alfred could be brought as witness to the continued vitality of the Christian church. Nevertheless, this religiosity was mostly skin-deep; only 27% of Americans called themselves deeply religious.|$|E

25|$|The {{shoulder}} girdle of ichthyosaurs {{is not much}} modified from its original condition. Some basal forms show a hatchet- or crescent-shaped shoulder blade or scapula; derived forms have an elongated blade positioned <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> base. The scapula is not fused with the coracoid into a scapulocoracoid, indicating that the forces exerted on the {{shoulder girdle}} were moderate. The shoulder joint is positioned {{on the border between}} the scapula and the coracoid. Both coracoids are fused on their common midline. The coracoid shape is very variable, but usually it is rather low. The upper part of the shoulder girdle is formed by two long and slender clavicles, crowned by a central interclavicular bone that is large and triangular with basal forms, small and T-shaped in Jurassic species. Breast bones or sterna are absent.|$|E
25|$|Pocchiola and Vegter (1996a,b,c) {{originally}} {{defined a}} pseudotriangle to be a simply-connected {{region of the}} plane bounded by three smooth convex curves that are tangent at their endpoints. However, subsequent work has settled <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> definition that applies more generally to polygons {{as well as to}} regions bounded by smooth curves, and that allows nonzero angles at the three vertices. In this broader definition, a pseudotriangle is a simply-connected region of the plane, having three convex vertices. The three boundary curves connecting these three vertices must be convex, in the sense that any line segment connecting two points on the same boundary curve must lie entirely outside or on the boundary of the pseudotriangle. Thus, the pseudotriangle is the region between the convex hulls of these three curves, and more generally any three mutually tangent convex sets form a pseudotriangle that lies between them.|$|E
25|$|Fudan has reconstructed {{its course}} system to suit {{education}} goals. A course scheme of general education, specialized education and basic education in {{arts and sciences}} has been implemented. Encompassing a complete and comprehensive range of disciplines, the courses of general education enable students to receive education in diverse fields. All of the 70-plus undergraduate majors of Fudan have been put into seven general categories so that students can benefit <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> scale from the systematic discipline training. According to the Education Scheme for Arts and Sciences, course modules are determined by discipline systems and course suits, and credits by course modules. In this sense, Fudan provides students with more options for their college studies. In contrast with the traditional syllabus, the new module has appropriately decreased the gross credits and class hours. Along with minor programs and extracurricular academic activities, it contributes greatly to the intellectual development of undergraduate students, exposing them to {{a wider range of}} knowledge.|$|E
