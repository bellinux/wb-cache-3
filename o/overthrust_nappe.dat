40|$|In the {{northern}} part of Swedish Caledonides, north of Lake Torneträsk is a 7 km long exposure of a breccia layer. The layer thins westwards and eastwards from the central part where it is up to 27 m thick. It is called the Vakkejokk Breccia after the type section. The breccia has been described in literature since about a century, but its origin is enigmatic. The breccia layer is since the summer of 2012 investigated by three geologists specialized in impact craters, Paleozoic sediments, and the Caledonian orogeny. They put forward evidence for the breccia being formed by a hypervelocity impact during the Lower Cambrian at approximately 520 Ma (Ormö et al. 2017). At that time the target area was a shallow epicontinental sea that surrounded the mainly peneplanized continent Baltica. An impact into the sea is known to generate tsunami waves as well as resurge deposits when the water brings ejected and rip-up material back into the crater. Ormö et al. (2017) suggest the top part of the Vakkejokk Breccia to include such resurge deposits. The depositional marine environment is also known to rapidly protect an impact crater from further erosion. It is possible that only the topographic rim of the Vakkejokk crater was eroded during the millions of years it may have taken before the crater was covered by younger sediments. About 100  m. y. after the formation, it was completely covered by <b>overthrust</b> <b>nappes</b> during the Caledonian orogeny, when Baltica and Laurentia collided. The crater itself is not exposed today, merely parts of what is thought to be the ejecta layer and resurge deposits.

This was carried out by three short drillcores through the resurge deposit part of the Vakkejokk Breccia layer. The place to drill the boreholes was chosen at an outcrop which is proximal to the putative hidden crater. The retrieved drillcores were cut longitudinally, then polished and photographed in high resolution. Each core was then analyzed in an image analysis software with respect to clast granulometry and lithology.

Our study presents the biostratigraphical results obtained on sections from the Jédidi Formation, which characterizes the basinal series of the Tunisian Trough. We provide new direct age determinations from the base, the middle part and the top of the formation, which ranges from the latest Bajocian–middle Bathonian to the Oxfordian (Tethyan biozones UAZ 5 - 6 to 8 - 9). The onset of these radiolarianbearing series of the Tunisian Trough, adjacent to partly coeval Ammonitico Rosso successions, is interpreted as resulting from regional palaeotopographical gradient and palaeoceanographical conditions. Inaccurately interpreted as “true” radiolarites, theses series are different from coeval radiolarites of the Maghrebian “Dorsale calcaire” and from more recent homologous deposits of the Flysch domain.

We show that the succession captures the lower Middle Jurassic marine sediments of the pre-Late Albian Magura Basin, located to the north of an ancient submarine swell (Czorsztyn Ridge). The turbidite deposits of the Szlachtowa Formation and marly shales of the Opaleniec Formation yield dinoflagellate cysts indicative of the latest Aalenian or learliest Bajocian to Early Bathonian.

Preceding this collision, the island arc complexes of the Yarakvaam terrane on the northern margin of the North Asian craton record Early Car-boniferous to Neocomian ages in ophiolite, sedimentary, and volcanic rocks. Triassic to Jurassic amphibolites constrain the timing of subduction and intraoceanic deformation along this margin. The protracted (Neocomian to Aptian) colli-sion of the Chukotka passive margin with the North Asian continent is preserved {{in a range of}} structural styles includ-ing first north verging folding, then south verging folding, and finally late collisional dextral strike slip motions which likely record a change from orthogonal collision to oblique collision.

50|$|Many {{longitudinal}} valleys {{follow the}} strike {{of the rock}} strata or significant geological fault lines. These are formed {{in conjunction with the}} tectonic movements during the mountain building, which in turn are due to plate tectonic processes. The faults be structures that reach deep into {{the lower part of the}} earth's crust, that are already in place before the actual mountain building phase and are later reactivated as, for example, is the case in the Periadriatic Seam in the Alps. For the formation of longitudinal valleys, however, <b>nappe</b> <b>overthrusts</b> also play a major, if not the most important, role. The nappes that are present in many young fold mountain ranges is responsible to a large extent for the morphological division of a mountain belt into more or less parallel chains. In such cases, longitudinal valleys generally run along the so-called leading edge of the napped (the overthrust front), that are oriented at right angles to the direction of movement of the tectonic nappes, which in turn corresponds to the direction of movement of the colliding continental blocks. From this configuration results a course that runs with the strike of the geological units, which is an important criterion for the definition of a longitudinal valley. By contrast a transverse valley cuts across the strike.|$|R
40|$|A Late Cretaceous {{collision}} of the southernmost {{portion of the}} North American continental margin with an undetermined southern block was first established based on the sedimentation history of the plate's supracrustal cover, which is <b>overthrust</b> by harzburgite-dominated <b>nappes</b> of the Guatemala Suture Complex. The collision is also well registered in the metamorphic evolution of continental eclogites of the Chuacús complex, a geologic unit that represents Mesoproterozoic–Triassic sialic basement of North America at the boundary with the Caribbean plate. Garnet–clinopyroxene–phengite thermobarometry of eclogites hosted in Chuacús gneisses indicates near ultra-high-pressure conditions to ~ 700 °C and ~ 2. 1 – 2. 4 GPa. SHRIMP-RG U–Pb dating of eclogite metamorphic zircon yielded a 75. 5 ± 2 Ma age (95 % confidence level). Chondrite-normalized rare-earth element patterns of zircon lack Eu anomalies and show depletions in heavy rare earths, consistent with zircon growing in a plagioclase-free, garnet-rich, eclogite-facies assemblage. Additionally, a Sm–Nd clinopyroxene-two garnet–whole rock isochron from an eclogite band yielded a less precise but consistent age of 77 ± 13 Ma. The above features imply subduction to > 60 km depth {{of at least a}} portion of the North American sialic basement during Late Cretaceous collision. The Chuacús complex was overprinted by an amphibolite-facies event. For instance, mafic high-pressure paragneiss contains symplectite, resorbed garnet, and amphibole + plagioclase poikiloblasts. Zircon rims from the paragneiss sample show rare-earth patterns consistent with plagioclase growth and garnet breakdown. Their 74. 5 ± 3. 5 Ma SHRIMP-RG U–Pb age is therefore interpreted as the time of retrogression, which is consistent with previously published results. Within error, the ages of the eclogite-facies event and the amphibolite-facies retrogression are equivalent. Thus exhumation of the Chuacús slab from mantle to mid-crustal depth was quick, taking few million years. During exhumation, partial melting of Chuacús gneisses generated ubiquitous pegmatites. One of the pegmatites intruded the North Motagua mélange, which is a serpentinite-rich subduction complex of the Guatemala Suture Complex containing Early Cretaceous oceanic eclogites. U–Pb, Rb–Sr, and K–Ar ages of the pegmatite range ~ 76 – 66 Ma. Thus initial juxtaposition of continental and oceanic high-pressure belts of the Guatemala Suture Complex predates Tertiary–present strike-slip faulting between the North-American and Caribbean plates...|$|R
40|$|URL] audienceThe Trans-North China Belt (TNCB) is a Paleoproterozoic collisional orogen (ca. 1. 9 - 1. 8 Ga) {{responsible}} for the amalgamation of the North China Craton. Detail field works in Lüliangshan, Hengshan, Wutaishan and Fuping massifs where the belt is well exposed, allow us to draw new tectonic map and crustal-scale cross sections. The available petrologic, radiometric, geochronologic data are integrated in a geodynamic evolution scheme for this orogen. The Low Grade Mafic Unit (LGMU) is interpreted as an ophiolitic nappe rooted in a suture zone located {{in the western part}} of the Lüliangshan. This ophiolitic <b>nappe</b> <b>overthrusts</b> to the SE upon the Orthogneiss-Volcanites Unit (OVU) that consists of a bimodal volcanicsedimentary series metamorphosed under amphibolite facies conditions intruded by calcalkaline orthogneiss. The OVU is a composite Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic magmatic arc developed during two stages (ca. 2500 and 2100 Ma) upon a continental basement corresponding to the western extension of the Neoarchean Fuping massif. The OVU overthrusts to the SE the Fuping massif along the Longquanguan shear zone. This stack of nappe, coeval with an amphibolite facies metamorphism, is dated at ca 1880 Ma. Subsequently, the metamorphic series experienced a widespread migmatization at 1850 Ma and was intruded by post-orogenic plutons dated at 1800 Ma. The weakly to unmetamorphosed Hutuo Supergroup unconformably overlies the metamorphosed and ductilely deformed units (OVU and LGMU), but it is also involved in a second tectonic phase developed in subsurface conditions. These structural features lead us to question the ca 2090 Ma age attributed to the Hutuo supergroup. Moreover, in the Fuping massif, several structural and magmatic lines of evidence argue for an earlier orogenic event at ca 2100 Ma that we relate to an older west-directed subduction below the Fuping Block. The Taihangshan Fault might be the location of a possible suture zone between the Fuping Block and an eastern one. A geodynamic model, at variance with previous ones, is proposed to account for the formation of the TNCB. In this scheme, three Archean continents, namely from West to East, the Ordos, Fuping and Eastern Blocks are separated by the Lüliang and Taihang Oceans. The closure of the Taihang Ocean at ca 2100 Ma by westward subduction below the Fuping Block accounts for the arc magmatism and the 2100 Ma orogeny.

40|$|The Paleoproterozoic Trans-North China Belt (TNCB) is {{a nearly}} north-south {{trending}} zone, of 1200 km long and 300 km wide, which resulted from collision {{between the two}} Archean eastern and western blocks, marking the amalgamation of the North China Craton. Previous models which account {{for the evolution of}} the belt are mainly based on geochronology, petrology and geochemistry but lack of structural constraints. Field trips in the best-exposed crustal segment of the TNCB – the Lüliang, Hengshan, Wutai and Fuping Complexes - allow us to recognize several tectono-metamorphic units and to define the bulk geometry and kinematics of the belt. We decomposed the TNCB in two main lithological units, called the “Upper Wutai Unit” and the “Lower Wutai Unit”. The first one represents an ancient oceanic crust metamorphosed under greenschist facies conditions. The second unit consists of magmatic arc rocks which experienced an amphibolite facies metamorphism. Both units are interpreted as synmetamorphic nappes The Upper Wutai-Lüliang <b>nappe</b> <b>overthrusted</b> to the SE upon the Lower Wutai Unit which one is thrust south-eastward upon the Fuping complex via the kilometric scale Longquanguang Thrust. Deformation related to the Longquanguang Thrust reworked and cross cut the typical dome like structure of the Fuping complex. We think it represents a huge intracontinental ductile flat lying shear zone. Therefore, Hengshan, Wutaishan and Fuping complexes all belong to the same terrane named the Fuping Block. The Lower Wutai Unit and Upper Wutai Unit Nappes are rooted in a suture zone recognized in the western Lüliang massif, which resulted from closure of an oceanic domain (herein called Lüliang ocean) between the Western Block and the Fuping Block. Precise U-Th-Pb chemical EPMA dating on monazite reported on a P-T-t path from a Ky-metapelite allow us to evaluate the timing of peak of metamorphism around 1880 - 1890 Ma. The Lower Wutai Unit is extensively migmatized and crustal melting occurred at 1850 ± 5 Ma as indicated by LA-ICP-MS U/Pb zircon dating of a migmatitic leucosome. Moreover, the Fuping massif shows evidence for a ca. 2100 Ma tectono-metamorphic and magmatic event, which we interpret as resulting from the closure of an oceanic domain (herein called the Taihang ocean), by westward subduction below the Fuping complex Our model involves three Archean blocks, namely from West to East, the Ordos, Fuping and Eastern blocks separated by the Lüliang and Taihang oceans.

40|$|International audienceThe {{structural}} {{configuration of}} SW Japan mainly reflects a late Jurassic-early Cretaceous orogeny. The region {{is divided into}} an inner belt and an outer belt, on the Japan sea and Pacific ocean sides respectively, by a strike-slip fault, the Median Tectonic Line (MTL). Both consist {{of a series of}} stacked nappes. The inner belt is divided into a Jurassic olistostrome known as the Tanba zone and a hinterland area comprising continental Triassic-Jurassic sediments. The Tanba zone is sliced into two units: a lower one with late Jurassic matrix and Triassic-early Jurassic radiolarite olistoliths, tectonically overthrust by an upper unit comprising an olistostrome with middle Jurassic matrix and blocks which include late Paleozoic limestone, basic lava, and radiolarite. The Tanba zone is overthrust by a Paleozoic nappe complex derived from the hinterland. The basal sole of the nappe corresponds to a peculiar unit called the ultra-Tanba zone. In the Chugoku area, the hinterland is divided into an upper nappe: the Oga nappe, formed by Permo-Carboniferous limestone and Permian clastic rocks and a lower one: the Sangun-Maizuru nappe, formed by Paleozoic high pressure (HP) metamorphics (the Sangun schists), the Permian Maizuru olistostrome, and the dismembered Paleozoic Yakuno ophiolites. In the northern part of SW Japan, the Tanba zone is in faulted contact with the circum-Hida and the Hida zones. The former is interpreted as the equivalent of the Oga and Sangun-Maizuru nappes of the Chugoku domain crushed by post Cretaceous tectonics. The latter consists of Paleozoic high temperature (HT) metamorphic rocks and late Triassic-early Jurassic granite, locally mylonitized and covered by early Jurassic sandstone. The outer belt is formed by a superficial nappe similar to the Tanba zone thrust upon a "deep domain" characterized by a synmetamorphic ductile deformation. The "deep domain" is divided into a lower unit, the Oboke unit formed by continental derived arenites and a Green Schist nappe consisting of oceanic sediments and resedimented ophiolites. The Green Schist <b>nappe</b> <b>overthrusts</b> the Oboke unit under synmetamorphic conditions with an eastward displacement.

In the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic SW Japan is an active plate margin. The upper plate or South China block consisted of the hinterland and the Tanba belt, a forearc basin; the lower plate consisted of an oceanic area and the South Japan continent. The basic mechanism of the orogeny is ascribed to the oblique subduction and collision of the South Japan continent...|$|R
40|$|The Calabria-Peloritani arc is an {{intriguing}} {{segment of the}} Apenninic-Maghrebic Chain, formed {{unlike the rest of}} the chain by several thrust sheets involving the crystalline basement. It is inserted in the zone of maximum distorsion of the orogenic system. According to the most recent interpretation (BONARDI et al., 1980) two sectors, North and South of the Soverato-Valle del Mesima alignment, can be distinguished in the arc. They arc characterized by rather a different Alpine history. The present paper is an attempt to outline the evolution of the Northern sector by a semiquantitative palyn- spastic restoration of the main stages of the Alpine cycle. Among the proposed explanatory models the one considering the arc as a fragment of the Europe-verging Alpine chain overthrust upon the Africa-verging Apenninic chain was assumed for the only sector of interest as the best fitting the analytical data. However it was necessary to intro- duce some modifications in the model as previously defined and to propose a solution, even if hypo- thetical, to many unsolved problems. The history described can he summarized as follow: after an abortive rifting in the Middle Triassic, a progressive crustal extension, culminating in a true rifting in the Jurassic, individuated different palaeogeographic realms on the future African continental margin. At the opening of the Central Tethys, that in the tract of interest is supposed to have not reached a width more than some hundreds of Kms, a total width of 250 kms is evaluated for the portion of the African continental margin presently represented in the Calabria structure. It includes an Auslroalpine- Insubric domain and the inner border of the Apen- ninic domain. The problem of the beginning of the compression is discussed and in its first stage a contemporaneous subduction of both European and African plates is assumed as the more in agreement with the probable piling-up order of the nappes. This resulted in a consumption of oceanic and African continental lithosphere and in the build up of a chain (Eo-aipine) overturned toward an European foreland and formed by wedges of oceanic and flakes both of oceanic and of Austroalpine material. During the build up of the chain (Cretaceous-Paleogene) an early flysch basin (Cilento-Sicilide basin) individualized by laceration of a zone of crustal weackness possibly extending northward of the given area and between the "Insubric" and the Apenninic domains. After the collision of the two continents the compression continued by subduction of the African continental lithosphere alone and all the nappes were wedges verging toward an African foreland. A fragment of the Eo-alpine chain overthrust the "Insubric" domain that was progressively interested by deformation. In the Early Miocene the Eo- alpine building and the "Insubric" <b>nappes</b> <b>overthrust</b> as an unique tectonic element the inner border of the Apenninic domain. Further almost passive transport during the build up of the Apenninic chain, a partial disrup- tion by the opening of Tyrrhenian sea and a block faulting led to the present day setting. The palynspastic restoration gives also a rough evaluation of the crustal shortage in about 1 / 2 of the original width during the Europe-verging and between 1 / 2 and 1 / 3 during the Africa-verging deformation...|$|R

The oldest orthogneisses are dated at ca. 2820 Ma (Dodoma Suite) and the youngest alkaline syenite plutons at ca. 2610 Ma (Singida Suite). Plutonism was interrupted by a period of deposition of volcano-sedimentary rocks metamorphosed to greenschist facies, directly dated by a pyroclastic metavolcanic rock which gave an age of ca. 2725 Ma. This is supported by detrital zircons from psammitic metasedimentary rocks, which indicate a maximum depositional age of ca. 2740 Ma, with additional detrital sources 2820 and 2940 Ma. Thus, 200 Ma of episodic magmatism {{in this part of the}} Tanzania Craton was punctuated by a period of uplift, exhumation, erosion and clastic sedimentation/volcanism, followed by burial and renewed granitic to syenitic magmatism. In eastern Tanzania (Handeni block), in the heart of the East African Orogen, all the dated orthogneisses and charnockites (apart from those of the <b>overthrust</b> Neoproterozoic granulite <b>nappes),</b> have Neoarchaean protolith ages within a narrow range between 2710 and 2630 Ma, identical to (but more restricted than) the ages of the Singida Suite. They show evidence of Ediacaran “Pan-African” isotopic disturbance, but this is poorly defined. In contrast, granulite samples from the Wami Complex nappe were dated at ca. 605 and ca. 675 Ma, coeval with previous dates of the “Eastern Granulites” of eastern Tanzania and granulite nappes of adjacent NE Mozambique. To the south of the Tanzania Craton, samples of orthogneiss from the northern part of the Lupa area were dated at ca. 2730 Ma and clearly belong to the Tanzania Craton. However, granitoid samples from the southern part of the Lupa “block” have Palaeoproterozoic (Ubendian) intrusive ages of ca. 1920 Ma. Outcrops further south, at the northern tip of Lake Malawi, mark the SE continuation of the Ubendian belt, albeit with slightly younger ages of igneous rocks (ca. 1870 – 1900 Ma) which provide a link with the Ponte Messuli Complex, along strike to the SE in northern Mozambique. In SW Tanzania, rocks from the Mgazini area gave Ubendian protolith ages of ca. 1980 – 1800 Ma, but these rocks underwent Late Mesoproterozoic high-grade metamorphism between 1015 and 1040 Ma. One granitoid gave a crystallisation age of ca. 1080 Ma correlating with known Mesoproterozoic crust to the east in SE Tanzania and NE Mozambique. However, while the crust in the Mgazini area was clearly one of original Ubendian age, reworked and intruded by granitoids at ca. 1 Ga, the crust of SE Tanzania is a mixed Mesoproterozoic terrane and a continuation from NE Mozambique. Hence the Mgazini area lies at the edge of the Ubendian belt which was re-worked during the Mesoproterozoic orogen (South Irumide belt), providing a further constraint on the distribution of ca. 1 Ga crust in SE Africa. Hf data from near-concordant analyses of detrital zircons from a sample from the Tanzania Craton lie along a Pb-loss trajectory (Lu/Hf = 0), extending back to ∼ 3. 9 Ga. This probably represents the initial depleted mantle extraction event of the cratonic core. Furthermore, the Hf data from all igneous samples, regardless of age, from the entire study area (including the Neoproterozoic granulite nappes) show a shallow evolution trend (Lu/Hf = 0. 028) extending back to the same mantle extraction age. This implies the entire Tanzanian crust sampled in this study represents over 3. 5 billion years of crustal reworking from a single crustal reservoir and that the innermost core of the Tanzanian Craton that was subsequently reworked was composed of a very depleted, mafic source with a very high Lu/Hf ratio. Our study helps to define the architecture of the Tanzanian Craton and its evolution from a single age-source in the early Eoarchaean...|$|R
40|$|The Borborema Province (BP) is a {{geologic}} domain {{located in}} Northeastern Brazil. The BP is limited {{at the south}} by the São Francisco craton, at the west by the Parnaíba basin, and both at {{the north and east}} by coastal sedimentary basins. Nonetheless the BP surface geology is well known, several key aspects of its evolution are still open, notably: i) its tectonic compartmentalization established after the Brasiliano orogenesis, ii) the architecture of its cretaceous continental margin, iii) the elastic properties of its lithosphere, and iv) the causes of magmatism and uplifting which occurred in the Cenozoic. In this thesis, a regional coverage of geophysical data (elevation, gravity, magnetic, geoid height, and surface wave global tomography) were integrated with surface geologic information aiming to attain {{a better understanding of the}} above questions. In the Riacho do Pontal belt and in the western sector of the Sergipano belt, the neoproterozoic suture of the collision of the Sul domain of the BP with the Sanfranciscana plate (SFP) is correlated with an expressive dipolar gravity anomaly. The positive lobule of this anomaly is due to the BP lower continental crust uplifting whilst the negative lobule is due to the supracrustal <b>nappes</b> <b>overthrusting</b> the SFP. In the eastern sector of the Sergipano belt, this dipolar gravity anomaly does not exist. However the suture still can be identified at the southern sector of the Marancó complex arc, alongside of the Porto da Folha shear zone, where the SFP N-S geophysical alignments are truncated. The boundary associated to the collision of the Ceará domain of the BP with the West African craton is also correlated with a dipolar gravity anomaly. The positive lobule of this anomaly coincides with the Sobral-Pedro II shear zone whilst the negative lobule is associated with the Santa Quitéria magmatic arc. Judging by their geophysical signatures, the major BP internal boundaries are: i) the western sector of the Pernambuco shear zone and the eastern continuation of this shear zone as the Congo shear zone, ii) the Patos shear zone, and iii) the Jaguaribe shear zone and its southwestern continuation as the Tatajuba shear zone. These boundaries divide the BP in five tectonic domains in the geophysical criteria: Sul, Transversal, Rio Grande do Norte, Ceará, and Médio Coreaú. The Sul domain is characterized by geophysical signatures associated with the BP and SFP collision. The fact that Congo shear zone is now proposed as part of the Transversal domain boundary implies an important change in the original definition of this domain. The Rio Grande do Norte domain presents a highly magnetized crust resulted from the superposition of precambrian and phanerozoic events. The Ceará domain is divided by the Senador Pompeu shear zone in two subdomains: the eastern one corresponds to the Orós-Jaguaribe belt and the western one to the Ceará-Central subdomain. The latter subdomain exhibits a positive ENE-W SW gravity anomaly which was associated to a crustal discontinuity. This discontinuity would have acted as a rampart against to the N-S Brasiliano orogenic nappes. The Médio Coreaú domain also presents a dipolar gravity anomaly. Its positive lobule is due to granulitic rocks whereas the negative one is caused by supracrustal rocks. The boundary between Médio Coreaú and Ceará domains can be traced below the Parnaíba basin sediments by its geophysical signature. The joint analysis of free air anomalies, free air admittances, and effective elastic thickness estimates (Te) revealed that the Brazilian East and Equatorial continental margins have quite different elastic properties. In the first one 10 km < Te < 20 km whereas in the second one Te ≤ 10 km. The weakness of the Equatorial margin lithosphere was caused by the cenozoic magmatism. The BP continental margin presents segmentations; some of them have inheritance from precambrian structures and domains. The segmentations conform markedly with some sedimentary basin features which are below described from south to north. The limit between Sergipe and Alagoas subbasins coincides with the suture between BP and SFP. Te estimates indicates concordantly that in Sergipe subbasin Te is around 20 km while Alagoas subbasin has Te around 10 km, thus revealing that the lithosphere in the Sergipe subbasin has a greater rigidity than the lithosphere in the Alagoas subbasin. Additionally inside the crust beneath Sergipe subbasin occurs a very dense body (underplating or crustal heritage?) which is not present in the crust beneath Alagoas subbasin. The continental margin of the Pernambuco basin (15 < Te < 25 km) presents a very distinct free air edge effect displaying two anomalies. This fact indicates the existence in the Pernambuco plateau of a relatively thick crust. In the Paraíba basin the free air edge effect is quite uniform, Te ≈ 15 km, and the lower crust is abnormally dense probably due to its alteration by a magmatic underplating in the Cenozoic. The Potiguar basin segmentation in three parts was corroborated by the Te estimates: in the Potiguar rift Te ≅ 5 km, in the Aracati platform Te ≅ 25 km, and in the Touros platform Te ≅ 10 km. The observed weakness of the lithosphere in the Potiguar rift segment is due to the high heat flux while the relatively high strength of the lithosphere in the Touros platform may be due to the existence of an archaean crust. The Ceará basin, in the region of Mundaú and Icaraí subbasins, presents a quite uniform free air edge effect and Te ranges from 10 to 15 km. The analysis of the Bouguer admittance revealed that isostasy in BP can be explained with an isostatic model where combined surface and buried loadings are present. The estimated ratio of the buried loading relative to the surface loading is equal to 15. In addition, the lower crust in BP is abnormally dense. These affirmations are particularly adequate to the northern portion of BP where adherence of the observed data to the isostatic model is quite good. Using the same above described isostatic model to calculate the coherence function, it was obtained that a single Te estimate for the entire BP must be lower than 60 km; in addition, the BP north portion has Te around 20 km. Using the conventional elastic flexural model to isostasy, an inversion of crust thickness was performed. It was identified two regions in BP where the crust is thickened: one below the Borborema plateau (associated to an uplifting in the Cenozoic) and the other one in the Ceará domain beneath the Santa Quitéria magmatic arc (a residue associated to the Brasiliano orogenesis). On the other hand, along the Cariri-Potiguar trend, the crust is thinned due to an aborted rifting in the Cretaceous. Based on the interpretation of free air anomalies, it was inferred the existence of a large magmatism in the oceanic crust surrounding the BP, in contrast with the incipient magmatism in the continent as shown by surface geology. In BP a quite important positive geoid anomaly exists. This anomaly is spatially correlated with the Borborema plateau and the Macaú-Queimadas volcanic lineament. The integrated interpretation of geoid height anomaly data, global shear velocity model, and geologic data allow to propose that and Edge Driven Convection (EDC) may have caused the Cenozoic magmatism. The EDC is an instability that presumably occurs at the boundary between thick stable lithosphere and oceanic thin lithosphere. In the BP lithosphere, the EDC mechanism would have dragged the cold lithospheric mantle into the hot asthenospheric mantle thus causing a positive density contrast that would have generated the main component of the geoid height anomaly. In addition, the compatibility of the gravity data with the isostatic model, where combined surface and buried loadings are present, together with the temporal correlation between the Cenozoic magmatism and the Borborema plateau uplifting allow to propose that this uplifting would have been caused by the buoyancy effect of a crustal root generated by a magmatic underplating in the CenozoicConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e TecnológicoA Província Borborema (PB) é um domínio geológico-estrutural localizado no Nordeste do Brasil, limitado a sul pelo Cráton do São Francisco, a oeste pela Bacia do Parnaíba e a norte e leste pelas bacias costeiras. Embora bastante estudada por geologia de superfície, na PB ainda estão em aberto aspectos importantes de sua evolução, notadamente: i) a sua compartimentagem tectônica após a Orogênese Brasiliana, ii) a arquitetura da margem continental implantada no Cretáceo, iii) as propriedades elásticas de sua litosfera, e iv) as causas do magmatismo e do soerguimento no Cenozóico. Esta Tese empregou dados geofísicos de cobertura regional (elevação, gravimetria, magnetometria, altura geoidal e tomografia), para aportar informações de geologia profunda aos problemas acima colocados. A sutura gerada pela colisão neoproterozóica entre o Domínio Sul da PB e a Placa Sanfranciscana (PSF) é marcada, na Faixa Riacho do Pontal e no oeste da Faixa Sergipana, por uma forte anomalia gravimétrica dipolar, cujo pico positivo corresponde ao alçamento da crosta inferior da PB e o negativo corresponde às nappes de supracrustais empurradas sobre a PSF. Na região leste da Faixa Sergipana não há assinaturas gravimétricas que indiquem cavalgamento e flexura de placas, mas a interpretação de truncamentos de assinaturas geofísicas de direção N-S da PSF permite localizar a sutura na margem sul do complexo de arco Marancó, ao longo da Z. C. Porto da Folha. Por sua vez, o limite colisional do Domínio Ceará da PB com o Cráton Oeste-Africano, ao longo da Z. C. Sobral-Pedro II, é também marcado por uma anomalia gravimétrica dipolar, cujo pico positivo coincide com a Z. C. Sobral-Pedro II, e o negativo coincide com o arco magmático de Santa Quitéria. A julgar pela expressão geofísica, os limites internos mais importantes da PB são:|$|R
