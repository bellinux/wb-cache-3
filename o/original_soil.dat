40|$|The {{influence}} of two organic amendments on norflurazon sorption-desorption processes in four soils {{with very different}} physicochemical characteristics was studied in laboratory experiments to evaluate the potential leaching of this pesticide through organic fertilized soils. Sorption-desorption experiments were performed on <b>original</b> <b>soils</b> and on a mixture of these soils with urban waste compost (SUW) and a commercial amendment from olive-mill wastes (OW), {{at a rate of}} 6. 25 % (w/w). These mixtures were used immediately after preparation and after aging for 2 months. Norflurazon was analyzed by using a HPLC method. Norflurazon retention in <b>original</b> <b>soils</b> was related not only to the organic matter (OM) content but also to mineral surfaces present in soils. Norflurazon sorption increases largely after amendment in soils with low OM content, but the addition of exogenous OM to soils with medium OM content and/or other available adsorptive surfaces did not significantly affect norflurazon sorption. Even in some cases pesticide sorption decreases, due to the blocking of the mineral and organic soil surfaces with the amendment added. Transformation of exogenous OM during incubation depends both on the amendment added and on the type of soil and can affect sorption-desorption behavior of the soils surfaces in different manner, due to the modification of their hydrophobic-hydrophilic characteristics. Norflurazon desorption from <b>original</b> <b>soils</b> showed hysteresis in all cases, but it was not affected or even decreased in amended soils. It was a nonexpected behavior, especially in sandy soil, since it is generally assumed that a higher sorption always implies a lower mobility in soils. Norflurazon sorption must be taking place on very low affinity sites on exogenous OM through weak bindings, from which the pesticide can be easily desorbed. The application to soils of the organic amendments {{used in the present study}} could not be accepted to reduce norflurazon losses due to leaching processes.

From the point where Injun Creek falls into the Rio San Juan Smith, up along both banks of the former into the cañon whence it emerges, extended a double row of forlorn shanties that seemed about to fall upon one another's neck to bewail their desolation; while about an equal number appeared to have straggled up the slope on either hand and perched themselves upon commanding eminences, whence they craned forward {{to get a good}} view of the affecting scene. Most of these habitations were emaciated as by famine to the condition of mere skeletons, about which clung unlovely tatters of what might have been skin, but was really canvas.

6000|$|Because--and {{this was}} a serious objection--then surely the coal would be impure--mixed up with mud and sand, till it was not worth burning. [...] Instead of which, the coal is usually pure vegetable, parted sharply from the {{sandstone}} which lies on it. The only other explanation was, that the coal vegetation had grown in the very places where it was found. But that seemed too strange to be true, till that great geologist, Sir W. Logan--who has since done such good work in Canada- -showed that every bed of coal had a bed of clay under it, and that that clay always contained fossils called Stigmaria. Then it came out that the Stigmaria in the under clay had long filaments attached to them, while when found in the sandstones or shales, they had lost their filaments, and seemed more or less rolled--in fact, that the natural place of the Stigmaria was in the under clay. Then Mr. Binney discovered a tree--a Sigillaria, standing upright in the coal- measures with its roots attached. Those roots penetrated into the under clay of the coal; and those roots were Stigmarias. That seems to have settled the question. The Sigillarias, at least, had grown where they were found, and the clay beneath the coal-beds was the <b>original</b> <b>soil</b> on which they had grown. Just so, if you will look at any peat bog you will find it bottomed by clay, which clay is pierced everywhere by {{the roots of the}} moss forming the peat, or of the trees, birches, alders, poplars, and willows, which grow in the bog. [...] So the proof seemed complete, that the coal had been formed out of vegetation growing where it was buried. If any further proof for that theory was needed, it would be found in this fact, most ingeniously suggested by Mr. Boyd Dawkins. The resinous spores, or seeds of the Lepidodendra make up--as said above--a great part of the bituminous coal. Now those spores are so light, that if the coal had been laid down by water, they would have floated on it, and have been carried away; and therefore the bituminous coal must have been formed, not under water, but on dry land.|$|E

Many of these effects are dependent upon environmental conditions and, in particular, on nutrient quality and availability in soils. In this context, {{we set up}} a pot experiment in order to examine the combined effects of soil nutrient availability and microbial communities on plant-soil interactions and to investigate assemblage rules for soil bacterial communities under changed nutrient conditions. Four gamma-sterilized soils, strongly differing in their nutrient contents, were obtained from different fertilization treatments of a centenary field experiment and used to grow communities of grassland plants. The sterilized soils were either self- or cross-inoculated with microbial consortia from the same four soils. Molecular fingerprinting analyses were carried out at several time points in order to identify drivers and underlying processes of microbial community assemblage. We observed that the bacterial communities that developed in the inoculated sterilized soils differed from those in the <b>original</b> <b>soils,</b> displaying dynamic shifts over time. These shifts were illustrated by the appearance of numerous OTUs that had not been detected in the <b>original</b> <b>soils.</b> The community patterns observed in the inoculated treatments suggested that bacterial community assembly was determined by both niche-mediated and stochastic-neutral processes, whereby the relative impacts of these processes changed {{over the course of the}} vegetation season. Moreover, our experimental approach allowed us not only to evaluate the effects of soil nutrients on plant performance but also to recognize a negative effect of the microbial community present in the soil that had not been fertilized for more than 100 years on plant biomass.

The cause of this peculiar insanity lies deep in the Anglo-American heart. After all these bloody wars and vindictive animosities, we have still an unspeakable yearning towards England.

What pains did they take to shake us off, and have ever since taken to keep us wide apart from them! It might seem their folly, but was really their fate, or, rather, the Providence of God, who has doubtless a work for us to do, in which the massive materiality of the English character would have been too ponderous a dead-weight upon our progress. And, besides, if England had been wise enough to twine our new vigor round about her ancient strength, her power would have been too firmly established ever to yield, in its due season, to the otherwise immutable law of imperial vicissitude.

40|$|Excavation {{followed}} by landfilling {{is one of}} the most common methods for treating soils contaminated with metals. Removing the metals through soil washing not only allows valuable substances to be recovered, but also results in cleaner soil residues. In this project a method for leaching and recovering Cu from polluted soils using acidic wastewater is further developed and evaluated, with special attention to the leaching process. In addition, the qualities of the soil residues are assessed in order to investigate how the proposed remediation method affects the soil properties. Soil samples highly polluted with copper (Cu) were collected from two sites in Sweden. After acidic leaching and water washing, the Cu content of the soil samples was reduced five times or more. The <b>original</b> <b>soils</b> could not even be deposited in landfills for hazardous waste; however after treatment of the soils according to the proposed method, the Cu leaching decreased six-fold and the solid residue was safe enough to be deposited in landfills for non-hazardous waste. The soil function “soil as filter and buffer for heavy metals” was evaluated using the TUSEC (technique for soil evaluation and categorization for natural and anthropogenic soils) manual. Originally the soils were of “low” i. e. class 4 or “very low capacity of binding and buffering heavy metals” i. e. class 5, while after the remediation process, both soils were categorized as Class 5. To summarize, the proposed method clearly shows potential not only for remediation of Cu polluted soils but also indicate a potential for recovery and reuse of Cu from the leachates generated. Even though the previously highly polluted soils could not be directly put back at the original sites, the solid residues could be deposited in landfills for non-hazardous waste, which is an improvement, considering the <b>original</b> <b>soils</b> could not even be deposited in a landfill for hazardous waste...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Chlorimuron-ethyl is a {{sulfonylurea}} herbicide {{widely used}} to control many annual broadleaf weeds, and the residue {{for a long period}} posed a heavy hazard to rotational crops or vegetables. Knowledge about effect of soil pH and organic matter on desorption processes of chlorimuron-ethyl remains obscure. In this study, desorption behavior of chlorimuron-ethyl as a function of soil pH and organic matter was investigated. Materials and methods Two typical soils in northeastern China, brown earth (luvisols) and black soil (phaeozem), were used in this study. Soils were treated with peroxide to remove organic matter. Desorption kinetics of chlorimuron-ethyl in the original and H(2) O(2) -treated soils were simulated. The adsorption and desorption experiments were conducted at three different pH values with the <b>original</b> <b>soils</b> using batch equilibration methods. For the soils after having removed organic matter, the lower concentrations of adsorption were not used for desorption study because the concentrations expected were lower than the limit of detection of the method. Results and discussion The pseudo-second-order equation could well describe the desorption kinetics and the desorption velocity increased significantly from the soils after the removal of organic matter. The desorption data were well fitted with the Freundlich isotherm with high regression coefficients (R(2) > 0. 97). Besides, the apparent hysteresis was observed for the desorption of chlorimuron-ethyl from the two soils, and the desorption from black soil was weaker than that from brown earth due to the higher content of organic matter and clay, and lower proportion of sand. The desorption of chlorimuron-ethyl from both soils became more difficult with an increase in the initial concentrations {{as a result of the}} gradient effect of concentrations. The degree of hysteresis increased as soil pH increased due to the strengthened binding energy of adsorption interactions. Conclusions The desorption of chlorimuron-ethyl from brown earth and black soil was significantly hysteretic, and the degree of hysteresis was greater for black soil than for brown earth. The increase of soil pH would enhance the retention of chlorimuron-ethyl and thus effectively retard chlorimuron-ethyl from entering the aqueous phase. The method of removing organic matter by H(2) O(2) treatment was not fit for researching effect of organic matter on the desorption of chlorimuron-ethyl from <b>original</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R

Moreover, acid deposition {{becomes more and}} more serious in this area. In this context, two forest soils (a red soil and a yellow red soil, typically and commonly found in southern China) were collected from Hunan. The objectives are (i) to determine releases and changes in speciation fractions of heavy metals (especially Cd, Cu, and Zn) when the soils are contaminated with heavy metals and affected by simulated acid deposition, and (ii) to study effects of soil heavy metals and acid deposition on releases of soil Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, and Al 3 +. The soil samples were soaked in the solutions of CdCl 2, CuCl 2, and ZnCl 2 for 15 days to make contaminated soils containing 200 mg kg 1 of Cd, Cu, and Zn. Then the contaminated <b>soils</b> and the <b>original</b> <b>soils</b> were extracted with five simulated acid deposition solutions (pH ranged from 5. 6 to 3. 0 and total dissolved salts increased). The experimental results indicate that acid deposition leads to great releases of soil heavy metals due to complicated soil chemical processes, mostly cation exchange and partly dissolution of minerals at pH lower than 4. 2. These released heavy metals come mainly from soil exchangeable pools and other labile fractions. Releases of heavy metals are closely controlled by pH values or, in some cases, total cation contents in acid deposition; meanwhile, concentrations of heavy metals are negatively related to the relevant pH values in soil equilibrium solutions when pH values are in a range of 4. 2 – 5. 1. From {{the point of view of}} heavy metal releases, Zn is the most sensitive to acid deposition, followed by Cd and Cu. Compared with the <b>original</b> <b>soils,</b> the contaminated soils could probably release more base cations Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + and less Al 3 +.

Its setting up and development resulted {{in the formation of}} human-altered and human-transported (HAHT) soils, largely through physical-mechanical excavation, transportation and rolling out the <b>original</b> <b>soils</b> (Palexeralfs, Haploxeralfs), as well as mixing and covering them with innocuous artifacts referred to as human-transported materials (HTM). On this basis, research began with a view to evaluating the anthropogenic processes in addition to the main morphological and physical–chemical characteristics of HAHT soils as compared with reference soils (RefS), their pedovariability and the classification of HAHT soils through Soil Taxonomy. The anthro-pedoturbation induced by mixing HTM to preexisting- presently buried- soils has dramatically disturbed the “natural” pedogenetic evolution, and driven the pro-isotropic processes leading the HAHT soils to much more simplified morphology and homogenization of chemical–physical features, with an impressive loss of pedovariability. They currently meet the requirements for a “mantle” classifiable as Alfic Xerarents, as an expression of the “entisolization” that induced a taxonomic shift from Alfisols to anthropogenic Entisols...|$|R
