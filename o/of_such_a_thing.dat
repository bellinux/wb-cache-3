25|$|Barth's {{doctrine}} of election involves a firm rejection {{of the notion of}} an eternal, hidden decree. In keeping with his Christo-centric methodology, Barth argues that to ascribe the salvation or damnation of humanity to an abstract absolute decree is to make some part of God more final and definitive than God's saving act in Jesus Christ. God's absolute decree, if one may speak <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing,</b> is God's gracious decision to be for humanity in the person of Jesus Christ. Drawing from the earlier Reformed tradition, Barth retains the notion of double predestination but makes Jesus himself the object of both divine election and reprobation simultaneously; Jesus embodies both God's election of humanity and God's rejection of human sin. While some regard this revision of the {{doctrine of}} election as an improvement on the Augustinian-Calvinist doctrine of the predestination of individuals, critics, namely Brunner, have charged that Barth's view amounts to a soft universalism, thereby departing from Augustinian-Calvinism.|$|E
25|$|The Gaidhil in {{this context}} are the Gaelic Irish of Ulster and perhaps beyond. Whether he {{purchased}} his lands himself (one tradition) or was granted them by the English Crown (another) is also unknown, and {{his relationship with the}} leading English and other Scottish magnates of the region was probably complex. The first Earl of Ulster (1st creation), Hugh de Lacy, was dead by 1242/3 and his authority, namely the Earldom of Ulster, over the eastern quarter of the modern province of Ulster, this region being then called Ulidia, was incomplete. It is possible that the Bissetts aided de Lacy against his Scottish rival Donnchad, Earl of Carrick and received some of the latter's lands for their assistance, but while attractive no account <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> is preserved. Following de Lacy's death, Brian Ua Néill rose to become the most powerful king in all the north of Ireland and in the 1250s was busy smashing the young earldom to pieces, killing many of the English (presumably Scots also) and destroying their castles, and the Bissetts may have been among the sufferers. However, the report of John Byset's death in 1257 shows that the family were viable and may have found themselves possibly even the most prominent British family remaining in Ulidia for a period, since no others are mentioned in the annals. O'Neill was elected High King of Ireland in 1258 by the O'Conors and O'Briens but his death only two years later in the Battle of Druim Dearg came too soon for a major Gaelic overlordship to be established and Walter de Burgh, the Lord of Connacht, was created Earl of Ulster four years after the conflict to preserve England's interests there. Possibly the Bissetts were forced to become his subordinates, but {{it has been argued that}} theirs was understood to be, in any case, a palatine lordship from its creation, whenever that may have been.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{hailed the}} episode as {{successful}} in telling a complex story {{about all the}} characters in a unique way, while retaining the series' effective elements of writing and character development. Throughout the show—as {{in the rest of}} the series—the characters self-consciously address their own dialogue and actions. Anya describes her own duet [...] "I'll Never Tell" [...] as [...] "a retro pastiche that's never gonna be a breakaway pop hit". With a characteristic dry demeanor, Giles explains that he overheard the information about Sunnydale residents spontaneously combusting as he was eavesdropping upon the police taking [...] "witness arias". In her opening number, [...] "Going Through the Motions", Buffy sings that she feels as though she is playing a part: [...] "nothing here is real, nothing here is right". The song introduces the character's emotional state but also removes the barrier between the actor and the audience, as Gellar the actor portrays Buffy, who feels she is merely playing the part of the Slayer. This hints to the audience that the episode's musical format is strange to the actors and characters. According to Buffy essayist Richard Albright, the lack of polish among cast members' singing voices added to the authenticity of their breaking out into song for the first time in the series. Whedon included self-conscious dialogue and references about the characters being in a musical and showed their reluctance toward song and dance, so that the audience would feel more comfortable with the improbability <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> happening on the show.|$|E

500|$|According to Elisabeth Dhanens, {{the shape}} and rounded top of the {{original}} frame is reminiscent of those found on the top register of panels of the Ghent altarpiece, which are accepted as designed by Jan's brother Hubert. [...] She believes the current frame is too narrow and small, and contains [...] "clumsy marbling". From a detailed 1851 inventory, we know {{the text of the}} hymn inscribed on original frame. The text is written in a poetic form and begun on the lower border and then extended upwards on the vertical borders, ending on the top border. The lower border of the frame read FLOS FLORIOLORUM APPELLARIS; the sides and top MATER HEC EST FILIA PATER EST NATUS QUIS AUDIVIT TALIA DEUS HOMO NATUS ETCET ("The mother is the daughter. This father is born. Who has heard <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing?</b> God born a man"). The fifth stanza of the hymn (not included in van Eyck's transcription) reads, [...] "As the sunbeam through the glass. Passeth but not staineth. Thus, the Virgin, as she was. Virgin still remaineth." [...] The lettering on the hem of her robe echoes the inscription on the frame, words similar to those found on Mary's dress in van Eyck's 1436 Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele, a passage from the Book of Wisdom (7:29) reading EST ENIM HAEC SPECIOSIOR SOLE ET SUPER OMNEM STELLARUM DISPOSITIONEM. LUCI CONPARATA INVENITUR PRIOR ("For she is more beautiful than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. Compared with the light she is found to be superior").|$|E
2500|$|The {{explicit}} notion <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> {{was first}} introduced by a Newsweek article entitled [...] "The Hillary Doctrine" [...] and published in March 2011 by journalist Gayle Tzemach Lemmon. In it, Clinton {{is quoted as saying}} that she believes [...] "that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century." [...] To strengthen her argument for women's rights, Clinton situates this issue within the context of national security, in that, [...] "where women are disempowered and dehumanized, you are more likely to see not just antidemocratic forces, but extremism that leads to security challenges." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1936, John Gunther {{wrote that}} Reith's [...] "modernist citadel on Portland Place is more {{important}} in the life of Britain than most government offices". He [...] "rules the B.B.C. with a hand of granite", and that Reith [...] "has made it probably the finest broadcasting organization in the world"; Gunther predicted that he [...] "might make a considerable career if he went into politics". Reith, by 1938, had become discontented with his role as Director-General, asserting in his autobiography that the organisational structure of the BBC that he had created had left him with insufficient work to do. He was invited by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain to become chairman of Imperial Airways, the country's most important airline and one which had fallen into public disfavour because of its inefficiency. Some commentators have suggested a conspiracy amongst the Board of Governors to remove Reith, but that has never been proved, and there is no record <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> in Reith's own memoir.|$|E

2500|$|The {{right to}} free {{assembly}} is considered {{an aspect of the}} {{right to free}}dom of expression. Simply put by Lord Denning, [...] "it is the right for everyone to meet and assemble with his fellows to discuss their affairs and to promote their views". It has traditionally been regarded as a residual right which individuals are free to exercise so long as the law does not preclude them from doing so. According to Dicey, [...] "at no time has there in England been any proclamation of the right to liberty of thought or to freedom of speech, [...] it can hardly be said that our constitution knows <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> as any specific right of public meeting". There are no common law rights to hold meetings on public land or in public buildings and the owners of quasi-public spaces such as shopping centres may exclude members of the public. Peaceful meetings may be held on the highway so long as they do not restrict access by other road users.|$|E
2500|$|Rundstedt had {{resisted}} {{all attempts}} to recruit him to the various conspiracies against Hitler that had been operating inside the German Army since 1938. Although he had not denounced or reported any of the officers who had approached him, he had shown no sympathy with their appeals. By June 1944 the conspirators {{had given up on}} him (and indeed on all the senior field commanders), because he was not approached by the group around Tresckow and Stauffenberg who hatched the unsuccessful plot to kill Hitler with a bomb at the Wolf's Lair (Wolfsschanze), his headquarters in East Prussia, and had no inkling of what was planned. When he heard of the attempt on 20 July, his reaction was very hostile. A year later, in June 1945, he told the investigating commission preparing for the Nuremberg Trials: [...] "I would never have thought <b>of</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing,</b> that would have been base, bare-faced treachery." [...] Since he had every reason to try to put himself in a sympathetic light at Nuremberg, this certainly reflects his view in June 1944. He also argued, however, that the attempt to kill Hitler was pointless, because the German Army and people would not have followed the conspirators. [...] "The Army and also the people still believed in Hitler at that time, and such an overthrow would have been quite unsuccessful." [...] He reiterated his traditional sense of his duty as a soldier: had he supported the plot, he said, [...] "I would have emerged and been considered for all time the greatest traitor to my Fatherland." ...|$|E
