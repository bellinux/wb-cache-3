5|$|Brachytherapy {{can also}} be used in the {{treatment}} of tumours of the brain, eye, head and neck region (lip, floor of mouth, tongue, nasopharynx and oropharynx), respiratory tract (trachea and bronchi), digestive tract (<b>oesophagus,</b> gall bladder, bile-ducts, rectum, anus), urinary tract (bladder, urethra, penis), female reproductive tract (uterus, vagina, vulva), and soft tissues.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth is}} {{at the base of}} the lophophore. Food passes through the mouth, muscular pharynx ("throat") and <b>oesophagus</b> ("gullet"), all of which are lined with cilia and cells that secrete mucus and {{digestive}} enzymes. The stomach wall has branched ceca ("pouches") where food is digested, mainly within the cells.|$|E
5|$|The unusual genus, Entovalva, is endosymbiotic, {{being found}} only in the <b>oesophagus</b> of sea cucumbers. It has mantle folds that {{completely}} surround its small valves. When the sea cucumber sucks in sediment, the bivalve allows the water to pass over its gills and extracts fine organic particles. To prevent itself from being swept away, it attaches itself with byssal threads to the host's throat. The sea cucumber is unharmed.|$|E
5|$|In 1952 Gardner married Margaret Mercer and {{the couple}} had two children, Simon and Alexis. Gardner also had another daughter, Miranda, {{the result of a}} long affair with Susan Wright, former PA to Peter Sellers. In 1989, Gardner and his family moved to the US and it was in America that he was {{diagnosed}} with cancer; firstly for the prostate and then, six years later, of the <b>oesophagus.</b> The subsequent medical treatment in the US left him near bankrupt and he returned to the UK in November 1996. Shortly after his return, in February 1997, Margaret died unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} common {{congenital}} malformations affecting the esophagus are an esophageal atresia where the <b>oesophagus</b> ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach; and an esophageal fistula – an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea. Both of these conditions usually occur together. These are found in about 1 in 3500 births. Half of these cases may be part of a syndrome where other abnormalities are also present, particularly of the heart or limbs. The other cases occur singly.|$|E
5|$|Like other crustaceans, malacostracans {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} in which the heart pumps blood into the hemocoel (body cavity) where it {{supplies}} the needs of the organs for oxygen and nutrients before diffusing back to the heart. The typical respiratory pigment in malacostracans is haemocyanin. Structures that function as kidneys are located near the base of the antennae. A brain exists in the form of ganglia close to the antennae, there are ganglia in each segment and a collection of major ganglia below the <b>oesophagus.</b> Sensory organs include compound eyes (often stalked), ocelli (simple eyes), statocysts and sensory bristles. The naupliar eye is a characteristic of the nauplius larva and consists of four cup-shaped ocelli facing in different directions and able to distinguish between light and darkness.|$|E
5|$|Many {{amphibians}} {{catch their}} prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing {{it back into}} the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws. Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short <b>oesophagus</b> is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage. The enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{habits of}} the bivalves have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex than in most other molluscs. The animals have no brain; the nervous system consists of a nerve network {{and a series of}} paired ganglia. In all but the most primitive bivalves, two cerebropleural ganglia are {{on either side of the}} <b>oesophagus.</b> The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs, while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which can be quite large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior adductor muscle. These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.|$|E
5|$|Frogs have maxillary teeth {{along their}} upper jaw {{which are used}} to hold food before it is swallowed. These teeth are very weak, and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey. Instead, the frog uses its sticky, cleft tongue to catch flies and other small moving prey. The tongue {{normally}} lies coiled in the mouth, free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front. It can be shot out and retracted at great speed. Some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands. The eyes assist in the swallowing of food {{as they can be}} retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat. The food then moves through the <b>oesophagus</b> into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up. It then proceeds to the small intestine (duodenum and ileum) where most digestion occurs. Pancreatic juice from the pancreas, and bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, are secreted into the small intestine, where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed. The food residue passes into the large intestine where excess water is removed and the wastes are passed out through the cloaca.|$|E
5|$|Muscle cells (myocytes) {{form the}} active {{contractile}} tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility {{over a wide}} range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and {{this is the type of}} muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, <b>oesophagus,</b> respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.|$|E
25|$|Oesophageal {{diseases}} {{include a}} spectrum of disorders affecting the <b>oesophagus.</b> The most common condition of the <b>oesophagus</b> in Western countries is gastroesophageal reflux disease, which in chronic forms is thought to result in changes to the epithelium of the <b>oesophagus,</b> known as Barrett's <b>oesophagus.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Oesophagus</b> (10 letters) – Passes {{through the}} {{diaphragm}} at T10.|$|E
25|$|Echinostoma have a {{digestive}} system {{consisting of a}} pharynx, <b>oesophagus</b> and an excretory pore.|$|E
25|$|Arachnids produce {{digestive}} juices {{in their}} stomachs, {{and use their}} pedipalps and chelicerae to pour them over their dead prey. The digestive juices rapidly turn the prey into a broth of nutrients, which the arachnid sucks into a pre-buccal cavity located immediately {{in front of the}} mouth. Behind the mouth is a muscular, sclerotised pharynx, which acts as a pump, sucking the food through the mouth and on into the <b>oesophagus</b> and stomach. In some arachnids, the <b>oesophagus</b> also acts as an additional pump.|$|E
25|$|Some prisoners {{had their}} stomachs surgically removed and the <b>oesophagus</b> {{reattached}} to the intestines. Parts of the brain, lungs, liver, etc., {{were removed from}} some prisoners.|$|E
25|$|Embryos {{develop in}} a brood pouch. This pouch is a {{compartmentalized}} structure lying immediately above the <b>oesophagus</b> and develops {{only after the}} snail has reached maturity. Its size expands {{as the number of}} embryos increases. Tarebia granifera has 1-77 embryos in its brood pouch.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate may be {{a factor}} for {{heartburn}} in some people because one of its constituents, theobromine, may affect the oesophageal sphincter muscle, hence permitting stomach acidic contents {{to enter into the}} <b>oesophagus.</b> Theobromine is also toxic to some animals unable to metabolize it (see theobromine poisoning).|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{extensive}} use, {{the quality}} of the evidence supporting their use in some of these conditions is variable. The effectiveness of PPIs has not been demonstrated for every case. For example, although they reduce the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in Barrett's <b>oesophagus,</b> they do not change the length affected.|$|E
25|$|Acute disease {{might include}} infections such as oesophagitis, trauma caused {{ingestion}} of corrosive substances, or rupture of veins such as oesophageal varices, Boerhaave syndrome or Mallory-Weiss tears. Chronic diseases might include congenital {{diseases such as}} Zenker's diverticulum and esophageal webbing, and oesophageal motility disorders including the nutcracker <b>oesophagus,</b> achalasia, diffuse oesophageal spasm, and oesophageal stricture.|$|E
25|$|The radula {{is used by}} {{molluscs}} {{for feeding}} and is sometimes compared rather inaccurately to a tongue. It is a minutely toothed, chitinous ribbon, typically used for scraping or cutting food before the food enters the <b>oesophagus.</b> The radula is unique to molluscs, and is found in every class of mollusc apart from bivalves.|$|E
25|$|In {{humans and}} many other animals, the stomach is located between the <b>oesophagus</b> and the small intestine. It secretes {{digestive}} enzymes and gastric acid to aid in food digestion. The pyloric sphincter controls the passage of partially digested food (chyme) from the stomach into the duodenum where peristalsis takes over to move this {{through the rest of}} the intestines.|$|E
25|$|An EU {{committee}} in 1998 {{reported that there}} was usually clear evidence of tissue damage in the <b>oesophagus</b> of birds which had been gavage fed, although one 1972 study cited by the report observed no alteration of the oesophageal tissue. More recent scientific {{studies have shown that}} the esophagus of birds can be injured or inflamed by gavage feeding.|$|E
25|$|An insect’s sensory, {{motor and}} {{physiological}} processes {{are controlled by}} {{the central nervous system}} along with the endocrine system. Being the principal division of the nervous system, it consists of a brain, a ventral nerve cord and a subesophageal ganglion which is connected to the brain by two nerves, extending around each side of the <b>oesophagus.</b>|$|E
25|$|A heavy drinker until going teetotal in 1995, {{and a heavy}} smoker {{from the}} age of 12, Thaw was {{diagnosed}} with cancer of the <b>oesophagus</b> in June 2001. He underwent chemotherapy in hope of overcoming the illness, and at first seemed to be responding well to the treatment, but just before Christmas 2001 he was told that the cancer had spread.|$|E
25|$|These bracken-associated tumours might form a {{model for}} some types of human {{oesophageal}} cancer. Human papillomavirus DNA has been detected in around 18% of squamous cell carcinomas of the <b>oesophagus,</b> {{and there is an}} association between exposure to or consumption of bracken (which is used as a foodstuff and herbal remedy in South America, China, Japan, Korea and other countries) and risk of developing oesophageal cancer.|$|E
25|$|Blood meal {{digestion}} in ticks {{is similar}} in all species. The digestive system in both Ixodid and argasid ticks is histologically divided into foregut, midgut and hindgut. The foregut comprises the sucking pharynx and the <b>oesophagus.</b> The midgut contains a ventriculus with a valve, a variable number of blind diverticula (caeca), and a rectal tube. The hindgut is divided into a rectal bulb and the rectum itself.|$|E
25|$|Transoesophageal Doppler {{includes}} two main technologies; transoesophageal echocardiogram —which is primarily used for diagnostic purposes, and oesophageal Doppler monitoring—which is primarily {{used for the}} clinical monitoring of cardiac output. The latter uses continuous wave Doppler to measure blood velocity in the descending thoracic aorta. An ultrasound probe is inserted either orally or nasally into the <b>oesophagus</b> to mid-thoracic level, {{at which point the}} <b>oesophagus</b> lies alongside the descending thoracic aorta. Because the transducer is close to the blood flow, the signal is clear. The probe may require re-focussing to ensure an optimal signal. This method has good validation, is widely used for fluid management during surgery with evidence for improved patient outcome, and has been recommended by the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Oesophageal Doppler monitoring measures the velocity of blood and not true Q, therefore relies on a nomogram based on patient age, height and weight to convert the measured velocity into stroke volume and cardiac output. This method generally requires patient sedation and is accepted for use in both adults and children.|$|E
25|$|The larva hatches in the {{intermediate}} host and breaks {{through the wall}} of the intestine. It then forms a cyst in {{the intermediate}} host's body. The larva is initially rounded in form, with four or six short legs, but moults several times to achieve the adult form. The pentastomid reaches the main host when the intermediate host is eaten by the main host, and crawls into the respiratory tract from the <b>oesophagus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{nervous system}} is {{composed}} of the typical ganglia. The pedal ganglia are placed beneath the radula sac and joined together by an anterior and a posterior commissure. The abdominal ganglion lies {{a little to the}} right of the median line. The visceral ganglia occupy the angle between the lingual sheath and the <b>oesophagus</b> and the buccal ganglia are widely separated but joined together by a commissure nearly as thick as the ganglia themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{gallbladder}} develops from an endodermal outpouching of the embryonic gut tube. Early in development, {{the human}} embryo has three germ layers and abuts an embryonic yolk sac. During {{the second week}} of embryogenesis, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround and envelop portions of this sac. The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract. Sections of this foregut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the <b>oesophagus,</b> stomach, and intestines.|$|E
25|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract (digestive tract, digestional tract, GI tract, GIT, gut, or alimentary canal) is an organ system within humans {{and other animals}} which takes in food, digests it to extract and absorb energy and nutrients, and expels the remaining waste as feces. The mouth, <b>oesophagus,</b> stomach, and intestines {{are part of the}} {{gastrointestinal tract}}. Gastrointestinal is an adjective meaning of or pertaining to the stomach and intestines. A tract is a collection of related anatomic structures or a series of connected body organs.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the precise}} {{shape and size}} of the stomach varies widely among {{different}} vertebrates, the relative positions of the oesophageal and duodenal openings remain relatively constant. As a result, the organ always curves somewhat to the left before curving back to meet the pyloric sphincter. However, lampreys, hagfishes, chimaeras, lungfishes, and some teleost fish have no stomach at all, with the <b>oesophagus</b> opening directly into the anus. These animals all consume diets that either require little storage of food, or no pre-digestion with gastric juices, or both.|$|E
25|$|The {{digestive}} tract can mostly be traced, either because the intestines are still present {{or by the}} presence of food items. The position of the <b>oesophagus</b> is indicated by a five millimetre long series of small food particles. Below the ninth dorsal vertebra the location of the stomach is shown by a cluster of bones of prey animals, the organ itself likely having been dissolved by its own stomach acid shortly after death. The rather backward position of the cluster suggests the stomach was dual in structure, with a forward enzyme-secreting proventriculus preceding a muscular gizzard. Gastroliths have not been reported.|$|E
25|$|The gastric lining {{is usually}} {{divided into two}} regions, an {{anterior}} portion lined by fundic glands, and a posterior with pyloric glands. Cardiac glands are unique to mammals, and even then are absent {{in a number of}} species. The distributions of these glands vary between species, and do not always correspond with the same regions as in humans. Furthermore, in many non-human mammals, a portion of the stomach anterior to the cardiac glands is lined with epithelium essentially identical to that of the <b>oesophagus.</b> Ruminants, in particular, have a complex stomach, the first three chambers of which are all lined with oesophageal mucosa.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} {{digestive}} system, a bolus (a small rounded mass of chewed up food) enters the stomach through the <b>oesophagus</b> via the lower oesophageal sphincter. The stomach releases proteases (protein-digesting enzymes such as pepsin) and hydrochloric acid, which kills or inhibits bacteria {{and provides the}} acidic pH of 2 for the proteases to work. Food is churned by the stomach through muscular contractions of the wall called peristalsis – reducing {{the volume of the}} fundus, before looping around the fundus and the body of stomach as the boluses are converted into chyme (partially digested food). Chyme slowly passes through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum of the small intestine, where the extraction of nutrients begins. Depending on the quantity and contents of the meal, the stomach will digest the food into chyme within anywhere between forty minutes and a few hours. The average human stomach can comfortably hold about a litre of food.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} the female {{swallowed}} the fertilized eggs her stomach was no {{different from that of}} any other frog species. In the jelly around each egg was a substance called prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which could turn off production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. This source of PGE2 was enough to cease the production of acid during the embryonic stages of the developing eggs. When the eggs had hatched the tadpoles created PGE2. The mucus excreted from the tadpoles' gills contained the PGE2 necessary to keep the stomach in a non-functional state. These mucus excretions do not occur in tadpoles of most other species. Tadpoles that don't live entirely off a yolk supply still produce mucus cord, but the mucus along with small food particles travels down the <b>oesophagus</b> into the gut. With Rheobatrachus (and several other species) there is no opening to the gut and the mucus cords are excreted. During the period that the offspring were present in the stomach the frog would not eat.|$|E
