5|$|Funerals {{among the}} Antankarana are often celebratory events. Among villagers living near the sea, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} for the remains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one to be placed in a coffin which the family carries running into the sea.|$|E
5|$|For most girls, {{childhood}} {{came to an}} {{end with}} the onset of puberty, which was followed shortly after by betrothal and marriage. Although marriage arranged by the family was the norm, romantic love was not unknown. Most women bore many children but few survived infancy, and grief for the loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one was an inalienable part of life. The main form of birth control was abstinence, and while there is evidence of contraception it seems to have been mainly used by prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|Without {{speaking}} directly of death, both verses {{indicate the}} absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one, and the narrator's sadness and inability {{to cope with}} the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.|$|E

5|$|The average SPAR {{officer was}} 29 years old, single, a college graduate, and had worked {{seven years in}} a {{professional}} or managerial position (in education or government) before entering the service. The average enlisted SPAR was 24 years old, single, a high school graduate, and had worked for over {{three years in a}} clerical or sales job before joining the service. The likelihood was that she came from the state of Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, or California. The reasons for becoming a SPAR differed, but most likely it was patriotism, self-advancement, desire for travel and adventure, or the loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one in the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the film's original score was composed by Raymond Wong and performed by the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra. The score imitates traditional Chinese music used in 1940s swordplay films. One of Wong's works, Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained, provides a stark contrast between the villainous Axe Gang and the peaceful neighbourhood of Pig Sty Alley, depicted by a Chinese folk song, Fisherman's Song of the East China Sea. Along with Wong's compositions and various traditional Chinese songs, classical compositions are featured in the score, including excerpts from Zigeunerweisen by Pablo de Sarasate and Sabre Dance by Aram Khachaturian. The song, Zhiyao Weini Huo Yitian (只要為你活一天; Only Want to Live One Day for You), is sung in the background by Eva Huang {{at the end of}} the film. Written by Liu Chia-chang (劉家昌) in the 1970s, it tells of a girl's memories <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one, and her desire to live for him again. Kung Fu Hustle was nominated for Best Original Film Score at the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards.|$|E

25|$|Traumatic grief or {{complicated}} mourning are conditions {{where both}} trauma and grief coincide. There are conceptual links between trauma and bereavement since loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one is inherently traumatic. If a traumatic event was life-threatening, {{but did not}} result in death, then {{it is more likely that}} the survivor will experience post-traumatic stress symptoms. If a person dies, and the survivor was close to the person who died, then it is more likely that symptoms of grief will also develop. When the death is <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one, and was sudden or violent, then both symptoms often coincide. This is likely in children exposed to community violence.|$|E
25|$|Despite the zany {{humor of}} the show, Taxi often tackled such {{dramatic}} issues as racism, drug addiction, single parenthood, blindness, obesity, animal abuse, bisexuality, teenage runaways, divorce, nuclear war, sexual harassment, premenstrual mood disorders, gambling addiction, {{and the loss}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one.|$|E

25|$|This {{concerns}} {{itself with}} fiery religious fanaticism stoked {{up by the}} sudden death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one. The idea behind the song is {{that even the most}} ardent supporter of peace can be drawn into violent conflict if their faith is shattered beyond repair. The title reflects the onset of spiritual darkness that pervades and eventually clouds the mind through irrevocable grief and irretrievable loss. Without sounding too political, one can draw a parallel with the current clime of terrorism, where normally peaceful religious groups are being incensed to hatred.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Trevor's {{first book}} appeared. The Poetics of Melancholy in Early Modern England {{was a study}} of how writers such as John Donne, Edmund Spenser, and John Milton {{utilized}} the term melancholic to enhance their reputations as learned writers. In 2005, Trevor published his first collection of stories, The Thin Tear in the Fabric of Space. Each of these nine stories circles around a different experience of grief following the death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one. The collection {{is dedicated to the}} writer's sister, Jolee, who died unexpectedly in 1998.|$|E
25|$|Long before animal mummies {{were used}} as {{religious}} offerings, animals in Egypt were occasionally mummified for a more personal reason—as beloved pets that were to keep the deceased company in the afterlife. The most common Egyptian pets included cats, dogs, mongooses, monkeys, gazelles, and birds. Many Egyptians loved their pets, and the customary process of mourning the loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> pet included crying and shaving one’s eyebrows. Ancient Egyptian pets were given names like we name our pets today, evidenced by over 70 names deciphered inscriptions identifying pet dog mummies.|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{the social}} sharing of emotion derived from studies about {{emotional}} trauma. These studies show that after natural disasters, catastrophes, or life-change events people {{have a tendency to}} talk about their experiences and disclose their feelings and emotions. For example, in a 1975 study exploring the psychological reactions to the death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one, it was found that 88% of bereavers felt a need to talk about the event to others. Other studies produced similar findings for people who experienced natural disasters and for cancer patients. Rimé later proposed the term “social sharing of emotions” to describe this phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|The stages model, {{which came}} {{about in the}} 1960s, is a theory based on {{observation}} {{of people who are}} dying, not people who experienced the death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one. This model found empirical support in a study by Maciejewski et al. The research of George Bonanno, however, is acknowledged as inadvertently debunking the five stages of grief because his large body of peer-reviewed studies show {{that the vast majority of}} people who have experienced a loss do not grieve, but are resilient. The logic is that if there is no grief, there are no stages to pass through.|$|E
25|$|As Christ is {{believed}} to be God, it is justified to hold in one's mind the image of God-incarnate. Likewise, when one venerates an icon, it is not the wood or paint that are venerated but rather the individual shown, just as it is not the paper one loves when one might kiss the photograph <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one. As Saint Basil famously proclaimed, honour or veneration of the icon always passes to its archetype. Following this reasoning, the veneration of the glorified human saint made in God's image, is always a veneration of the divine image, and hence God as foundational archetype.|$|E

25|$|The hedonic {{treadmill}} theory originally {{proposed that}} most people return to a neutral level of SWB (i.e. neither happy nor unhappy) as they habituate to events. However, subsequent {{research has shown that}} for most people, the baseline level of SWB is at least mildly positive, as most people tend to report being at least somewhat happy in general and tend to experience positive mood when no adverse events are occurring. Additional refinements to this theory have shown that people do not adapt to all life events equally, as people tend to adapt rapidly to some events (e.g. imprisonment), slowly to others (e.g. the death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one), and not at all to others (e.g. noise and sex).|$|E
25|$|The plaintiff's damages {{may include}} {{compensatory}} and punitive damages. Compensatory damages are {{both economic and}} non-economic. Economic damages include financial losses such as lost wages (sometimes called lost earning capacity), medical expenses and life care expenses. These damages may be assessed for past and future losses. Non-economic damages are assessed for the injury itself: physical and psychological harm, such as loss of vision, loss of a limb or organ, the reduced enjoyment of life due to a disability or loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one, severe pain and emotional distress. Punitive damages are not available in all states and, when allowed, are usually only awarded {{in the event of}} wanton and reckless conduct.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the healthiest}} {{behaviors}} displayed by resilient {{families in the}} wake of a death is honest and open communication. This facilitates an understanding of the crisis. Sharing the experience of the death can promote immediate and long-term adaptation to the recent loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> one. Empathy is a crucial component in resilience because it allows mourners to understand other positions, tolerate conflict, and be ready to grapple with differences that may arise. Another crucial component to resilience is the maintenance of a routine that helps to bind the family together through regular contact and order. The continuation of education and a connection with peers and teachers at school is an important support for children struggling with the death of a family member.|$|E
