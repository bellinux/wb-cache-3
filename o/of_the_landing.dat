5|$|At Jig, {{the first}} wave of {{infantry}} (the 1st Dorsetshires and 1st Hampshires of the 231st Infantry Brigade) arrived at 07:25, and immediately came under fire from the casemated 75mm gun at Le Hamel. Due to navigation errors and the strong current, both groups came ashore well to the east of their intended landing points. The DD tank and Royal Marine Centaur tanks that were supposed to arrive in advance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> were delayed by rough seas and did not arrive until 08:00. Many of the tanks got bogged down on the beach or were taken out by enemy fire. The tide came in quicker than expected, before many of the beach obstacles and mines were cleared, and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> craft were damaged as a result.|$|E

5|$|A {{revision}} to Allied plans {{meant that}} Morotai played {{a much greater}} role in the liberation of the Philippines than had been originally envisioned. The invasion of Mindanao was postponed in September 1944 in favour of a landing at Leyte in the central Philippines in late October. The air bases at Morotai were the closest Allied air strips to Leyte, and fighters and bombers based on the island attacked targets in the southern Philippines and NEI in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> at Leyte on 25 October. After airfields were completed at Leyte, Morotai was also used as a staging point for fighters and bombers traveling to the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{exchange}} of fire, their crews ran both French ships onshore {{close to the}} mouth of the River Dives, where several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> barges that had survived the attack on the British-held Îles Saint-Marcouf were sheltering. Confiante was badly damaged and boarding parties from Hydra and the other ships were able to board and burn her the following morning. Vésuve had suffered less than the Confiante and troops onshore were able to protect her from further attack until her crew could bring her into the nearby harbour of Sallenelles. There she was repaired and eventually she returned to Le Havre.|$|E

5|$|All six LSTs were {{unloaded}} by 11:45. There {{was little}} opposition. Eleven Japanese {{soldiers were killed}} by the naval bombardment or assault troops. Perhaps as many as 150 transient Japanese troops were in the Saidor area, all of whom fled into the interior. American casualties on the day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> came to one soldier killed and five wounded, and two sailors drowned. Nine Japanese Nakajima Ki-49 (Helen) aircraft, escorted by up to twenty A6M Zero (Zeke) and Kawasaki Ki-61 (Tony) fighters bombed the beach area at 1630. There were three more air raids during the night, and 49 {{over the course of the}} month, but most were small.|$|E
5|$|As {{the convoy}} of landing craft and other vessels ferried the Commandos across the English Channel; however, {{they had a}} chance {{encounter}} with a German tanker escorted by a number of armed trawlers which proceeded to fire upon them.

5|$|Both {{airborne}} divisions began {{landing at}} the same time, 10:00 on 24 March 1945. The 6th Airborne were to protect the northern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> area; they had six drop zones around the town of Hamminkeln. The plan was for them to secure the town, the high ground east of the village of Bergen, and bridges across the river IJssel. The 5th Parachute Brigade would land on the northernmost DZ, DZ-B, and hold the area east of the Wesel railway line.|$|E

5|$|By dawn of 26 August, {{advancing}} west {{along the}} coast with armoured support, the Japanese had reached the main position manned by troops from B Company, 61st Infantry Battalion, around KB Mission. The Japanese force moved through the jungle {{at the edge of}} the coastal track, and was headed by two light tanks. Although they lacked anti-armour weapons, the Australians were able to turn back the Japanese attack. At this stage, the Japanese suffered a serious setback when their base area was heavily attacked at daylight by RAAF Kittyhawks and a Hudson aircraft, along with B-25s, B-26s and B-17s from the US Fifth Air Force. As a result of the attack, a number of Japanese troops were killed, while a large quantity of supplies was destroyed, as were a number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> barges which were beached near the KB Mission. Aside from severely hampering the Japanese supply system, the destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> barges also prevented their use to outflank the Australian battalions. The Japanese did not have any air cover as the fighters based at Buna which were to patrol over Milne Bay were shot down by Allied fighters shortly after they took off and other aircraft based at Rabaul were forced to turn back due to bad weather.|$|E
5|$|By {{moving the}} pan-tilt {{units of the}} laser range finders, it is also {{possible}} to obtain a point cloud in three dimensions. Technical readjustment between the model of the aircraft and the scene point cloud is already used in navigation to estimate the static placement of the robot.

5|$|Following {{the failure}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> at Porton Plantation, the planned Australian advance into the Bonis Peninsula was called off, and the Australians focused their main effort on Bougainville towards {{the capture of}} Buin in the south. The effort in the north was reduced {{to that of a}} holding action as further {{resources}} were transferred out of the sector. Nevertheless, the 31st/51st Battalion continued to undertake patrols along the Ratsua front, during which they suffered further casualties, until they were withdrawn from combat operations on 28 June. They were subsequently moved back to Torokina.|$|E

5|$|On D-Day, the 1st Special Service Brigade was {{tasked with}} linking {{up with the}} 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword and {{securing}} the high ground near La Plein.

5|$|On November 1, 2011, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16, a 767-300ER, safely {{landed at}} Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport in Warsaw, Poland after a {{mechanical}} failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> gear forced {{an emergency landing}} with the landing gear up. There were no injuries, but the aircraft involved was damaged and subsequently written off. At {{the time of the}} incident, aviation analysts speculated that {{it may have been the}} first instance of a complete landing gear failure in the 767's service history. Subsequent investigation determined that while a damaged hose had disabled the aircraft's primary landing gear extension system, an otherwise functional backup system was inoperative due to an accidentally deactivated circuit breaker.|$|E
