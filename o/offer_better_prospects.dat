40|$|The long-standing {{commitment}} of the European Union to integrate and fine-tune its policies across the security-development nexus, aims to end the devastating vicious cycle of insecurity and poverty in fragile states. This research holds this pledge up to the mirror of the EU’s underlying constitutional framework. The latter submits development cooperation and the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) – which includes the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) – to essentially different legal regimes. This erects a legal divide that ruthlessly cuts across policy efforts, instruments and communities tackling challenges on the security-development interface.

Radionuclides with half-lives {{ranging from}} some years to {{billions of years}} presumably {{synthesized}} outside {{of the solar system}} are now recorded in ‘live ’ or ‘fossil ’ form in various types of materials, like meteorites or the galactic cosmic rays. They bring specific astrophysical messages the deciphering of which is briefly reviewed here, with special emphasis on the contribution of Jerry Wasserburg First, the virtues of the long-lived (half-lives t 1 / 2 close to, or in excess of 10 9 y) radionuclides as galactic chronometers are discussed in the light of recent observational and theoretical works. It is concluded that the trans-actinide clocks based on the solar system abundances of 232 Th, 235 U and 238 U or on the 232 Th surface content of some old stars are still unable to meaningfully complement galactic age estimates derived from other independent astrophysical methods.

40|$|With {{almost three}} {{quarters}} of the labor force depending on agriculture in India, kick-starting agricultural growth is considered crucial for pro-poor development. More specifically, dairy production – which is labor-intensive but does not heavily rely on access to land – is generally expected to <b>offer</b> <b>better</b> <b>prospects</b> for income growth to the poorest among rural households. However, most policies aimed at increasing dairy production are based on ad-hoc observations, with hardly any micro-level evidence. Using a unique primary dataset on 1, 000 rural households in Andhra Pradesh, this paper investigates the dairy production system, addressing three main research questions: First, we look at the typical profile of a dairy farmer and we find that both family traditions in dairy and owning (even a small piece of) land play a role in determining participation in dairy – while land size does not matter. Second, we show that dairy production is strongly and positively associated with improvement in rural livelihoods, in terms of income per capita, but that this positive relation only holds for larger dairy farms. In a third step, we look at the determinants of farm growth and we find that households having higher shares of graded dairy animals have grown more after 2005. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - Smallholder {{farmers are}} {{increasingly}} subject to {{different types of}} standards that offer specific conditions for their market incorporation. The proliferation of private and voluntary (civic) standards raises questions regarding their impact on farmers' welfare and their role in upgrading of value chains. Design/methodology/approach - Based on extensive fieldwork and careful matching of 315 farmers in Northern Nicaragua that produce coffee under Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance and Café Practices labels or deliver to independent traders we compare the effects on income, production and investments. Moreover, the implications of different contract conditions for risk behaviour, organizational force, loyalty and gender attitudes are assessed Findings - We find that Fair Trade provides better prices compared to independent producers, but private labels outcompete Fair Trade in terms of yield and quality performance. While Fair Trade can be helpful to support initial market incorporation, private labels offer more suitable incentives for quality upgrading. Research limitations/implications - Civic standards exhibit major effects on local institutions and farmers behaviour, while B 2 B standards are more effective for improving production and management practices. Dynamic improvement standards may {{bridge the gap between}} both.

40|$|Land-use and {{transport}} systems {{are an important}} determinant of carbon dioxide emissions from urban regions. It is often asserted that urban compaction is the spatial policy best able to constrain travel and emissions, but evidence supporting this assertion is limited, {{particularly with respect to}} the combined emission from transport and land use. Here, using land-use – transport interaction models, a residential dwelling type model, {{and transport}} and emission models, we forecast and assess carbon dioxide emissions from transport, dwellings, and commercial space to 2031 for a range of spatial strategies realistically investigated for three English regions of decreasing size (the Wider South East region, Tyne and Wear, and Cambridge). Our results reveal that compaction can reduce emission relative to other spatial scenarios but that the differences are small, about 5 % between extremes, an order of magnitude less than emission growth observed over the trend period. Form has more influence for settlements where the pattern and proximity of employment, housing, and services can make cycling, walking, and public transport provision more feasible. We conclude that pricing and technology measures <b>offer</b> <b>better</b> <b>prospects</b> for combating the growth in carbon emissions of urban regions, but that the type of urban form delivered {{is likely to be a}} significant determinant in the type of clean energy technology that can be implemented. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{classical}} Walrasian equilibrium, {{everything is}} compressed {{into a single}} time period: all production, trade, and consumption. Efforts at expanding to a framework with uncertain future states beyond a present state have generally mimicked this pattern by insisting that, apart from possibilities opened by financial contracts, all the activity in each state must be self-contained. Goods cannot be saved or transformed in any way from present to future, and they cannot acquire value except through consumption {{in the state in}} which they originate. The model presented here pushes beyond these limitations in attempting to provide a better snapshot of activity that emerges from the past and looks ahead to a future be-yond some artificial doomsday. It establishes the existence of equilibrium in an extended “exchange ” economy with contracts for the delivery of real goods, some of which can be monetary. By adding simple mechanisms for some goods to be retained, combined or trans-formed into the future, it broadens the planning capabilities of agents even further, although without taking on the challenge of “firms ” that act intertemporally.
