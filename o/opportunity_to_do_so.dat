5|$|Discussions {{about making}} her sixth studio album being a Christmas record began on December 2012, {{a month after}} {{releasing}} her first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits – Chapter One. Having found the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> Clarkson commissioned producer and multi-instrumentalist Greg Kurstin, whom she had previously collaborated with on her albums Stronger and Greatest Hits – Chapter One, to solely produce the whole album. Despite having been raised in a Jewish faith and unfamiliar with Christmas songs, Kurstin still agreed to produce the project. As a result, the record marked the second time her studio album only had a single producer (the first being David Kahne solely producing My December in 2007). It also marked the fourth time Kurstin had solely produced an entire studio album apart from {{being a member of}} the musical groups The Bird and the Bee and Geggy Tah (the first three being Lily Allen's It's Not Me, It's You in 2009, Sia's We Are Born in 2010, and The Shins' Port of Morrow in 2012).|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{opposition}} in the fourth round were Italian side Roma. The first leg was held at Roma's home ground the Stadio Olimpico, where Liverpool had won the European Cup twice in 1977 and 1984. Incidentally, Roma were the team Liverpool beat to win the European Cup in 1984. Liverpool were once again successful at the Stadio Olimpico, as they won 2–0 courtesy of two Michael Owen second half goals. The second leg at Anfield was a close affair. Roma scored in the 70th minute to take the lead, they now needed to score another goal to take the match into extra-time. They looked like they had the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> when the referee awarded a penalty {{towards the end of}} the match after he had adjudged that Markus Babbel had handled the ball. However, moments later, he reversed his decision and instead awarded Roma a corner-kick. Roma were unable to score the necessary goal following the incident and Liverpool progressed to the quarter-finals courtesy of a 2–1 aggregate victory.|$|E

25|$|Greens leader Richard Di Natale, in {{a speech}} {{delivered}} to the National Press Club in March 2017, proposed that a discussion be had around the future of work in Australia, arguing that reduced work hours, or a shorter working week, will increase productivity and create new employment opportunities for those wishing to work more hours, while also allowing those wishing to work less the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> The shortfall in terms of wages earned would be made up through reform in the social welfare system; specifically, by {{the implementation of a}} universal basic income.|$|E
25|$|Ulysses had no {{particular}} inclination to military life {{at that time}} and at first declined to go, expressing little appreciation for the efforts of his father and friends. After a brief discussion, however, Jesse was able to convince Ulysses to enroll in the academy. As Ulysses was eager to set out into a world he had seen little of, he now saw the prospect as an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> with the hopes of becoming successful on his own. Upon word of his acceptance to West Point, Ulysses departed for New York on May 15, 1839. In 1847 Jesse sold his Georgetown home to Marshall Jenning for $2600.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no doubt}} that Pridi wanted to remove Phibun from power, and the war offered an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> However, there is no {{question}} that Pridi recognised well before the war that Thailand's alignment with the Axis powers would work to Phibun's advantage and enable him to strengthen his dictatorship. Even the Japanese recognised Pridi's hostility, which is why he was forced out of the cabinet in December 1941. It was the reason every knowledgeable person on the Allied side, from Seni Pramoj and Prince Suphasawat, a chief organiser of the movement in Great Britain, to former British ambassador Josiah Crosby, anticipated that Pridi would emerge as the head of a domestic resistance movement.|$|E

25|$|As governor, Miller was {{a staunch}} {{promoter}} of public education. He {{helped found the}} HOPE Scholarship, which paid for the college tuition of Georgia students who both established a GPA of 3.0 {{in high school and}} maintained the same while in college, and who were from families earning less than $66,000 per year. The HOPE Scholarships were funded by revenue collected from the state lottery. In December 1995, his office announced a proposal for $1billion more in spending on education. HOPE won praise from national Democratic leaders. The HOPE Scholarship program still to this day provides Georgia students with an opportunity to attend a public college or university, who otherwise may have no <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
25|$|Males are {{produced}} less frequently and in less quantity than females {{are produced}}. After eclosion males {{remain on the}} nest {{for up to a}} week. Upon leaving, they live nomadically and mate with females of other nests. Males do not assist in any of the colony maintenance activities while they reside in the nest. They are not well suited for foraging or defending the colony because of their weaker mandibles and lack of a stinger. They are dependent on female workers feeding them and are sometimes observed to cannibalize nest larvae. It has been experimentally demonstrated that males of R. marginata have the ability to feed larvae, but they do not because they lack food access and females do not give them an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> in natural populations.|$|E
25|$|The 2013 {{season for}} the Rapids saw massive changes made to the team. All-time leading goal scorer Conor Casey was {{released}} and Omar Cummings would be traded during the offseason, the Forward duo combining for 89 goals in the Rapids' careers. With {{the majority of the}} 2010 MLS Champions team gone (only 5 players remaining on the squad), the team looked considerably different. Coach Oscar Pareja wanting a squad of younger, more athletic players. Colorado finished the 2013 season campaign with a 14–11–9 (W-L-T) record which placed them fifth in the Western Conference, eighth in the overall standings. They were eliminated in the knockout round in the playoffs. During the off-season, Oscar Pareja revealed his desire to return to FC Dallas to be the Head Coach there after taking the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Eventually Colorado found his successor which would be none other than Colorado veteran Pablo Mastroeni who had previously retired as a player.|$|E

25|$|Broadcast 2 December 1993, this {{instalment}} {{looks at}} the summer, when almost all life in the region breeds. A South Georgian colony of fur seals is shown: the pups grow fast on the rich, fatty milk provided by their mothers and double their weight in just sixty days. As the females become sexually available, the mating season begins — males try to claim territory and mate with females. Chinstrap penguins form large groups on Deception Island, climbing up its steep slopes to find mountain ridges free of snow. Returning birds find their partners by recognising their voice (performing a brief greeting ritual when they find them), {{which is why the}} colonies are very noisy during the breeding season. Males and females take turns in catching food, some of which they later regurgitate for their chicks. The summer also thaws some of the ice on the continent's shores. The fresh water allows moss and other plants to grow, which in turn provide food for mites that are adapted to the cold climate — they can survive temperatures up to minus 30°C because they contain a kind of antifreeze. They become active as soon as the ice melts, and reproduce whenever they get an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Lichens grow even further south than moss, and algae populate some of the snow. In the ocean, life is much more diverse, and blue-eyed shags dive for fish near the peninsula. More than 300,000 petrels come to breed to the Scullin Monolith, one of the few areas of open rock.|$|E

[...] As there were no exceptional efforts made to ensure the non-corrosivity of the steel restraints, they summarily failed—resulting in the loosing of over two million individual, lightweight tires. [...] This newfound mobility destroyed any marine life that had thus far grown on the tires, and effectively prevented the growth of any new organisms. [...] Furthermore, the tires were now easily subject to the tropical winds and storms that frequent the east coast of Florida and continue to collide (at times with tremendous force) with other natural coral reefs only [...] away: compounding their uselessness with environmentally damaging side-effects.|$|E
