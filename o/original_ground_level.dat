5|$|Around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, using as the prototype for the three-arched bridge spanning the Avon an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Thus, Pulteney Bridge became {{not just a}} means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge and the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, which it resembles, {{it is one of}} the very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose. It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney, the owners of the Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath. The Georgian streets in the vicinity of the river tended to be built high above the <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> to avoid flooding, with the carriageways supported on vaults extending in front of the houses. This can be seen in the multi-storey cellars around Laura Place South of Pulteney Bridge, in the colonnades below Grand Parade, and in the grated coal holes in the pavement of North Parade. In some parts of the city, such as George Street, and London Road near Cleveland Bridge, the developers of the opposite side of the road did not match this pattern, leaving raised pavements with the ends of the vaults exposed to a lower street below.|$|E
25|$|The {{centre of}} the mound {{contained}} an oak-built main chamber (Grave I), built on the <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b> It measured 5.7 by 3.5 m and was circa 1 m high. This grave, containing {{a man and a}} woman, had already been plundered shortly after the burial. The remaining finds, reflecting its original riches include horse trappings, nearly 600 glass beads from a necklace, pieces of amber, and fine gold threads that were originally part of a brocade-like fabric. The floor had been covered with cowskins. A central mound, 5m high and 40 m in diameter covered this chamber.|$|E
25|$|William of Tyre, {{chronicler of}} the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, {{reports on the}} {{renovation}} of the Church in the mid-12th century. The crusaders investigated the eastern ruins on the site, occasionally excavating through the rubble, and while attempting to reach the cistern, they discovered part of the <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> of Hadrian's temple enclosure; they decided to transform this space into a chapel dedicated to Helena (the Chapel of Saint Helena), widening their original excavation tunnel into a proper staircase. The crusaders began to refurnish the church in a Romanesque style and added a bell tower. These renovations unified the small chapels on the site and were completed {{during the reign of}} Queen Melisende in 1149, placing all the Holy places under one roof for the first time. The church became the seat of the first Latin Patriarchs, and was also the site of the kingdom's scriptorium. The church was lost to Saladin, {{along with the rest of}} the city, in 1187, although the treaty established after the Third Crusade allowed for Christian pilgrims to visit the site. Emperor Frederick II (r. 1220–50) regained the city and the church by treaty in the 13th century while he himself was under a ban of excommunication, with the curious consequence that the holiest church in Christianity was laid under interdict. The church seems to have been largely in Greek Orthodox Patriarch Athanasius II of Jerusalem's hands, ca. 1231–47, during the Latin control of Jerusalem. Both city and church were captured by the Khwarezmians in 1244.|$|E
50|$|The mound was {{circular}} shaped with {{a diameter}} of 40 feet and a height of eight feet above the <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> surface at its midpoint. It was created from hard-packed yellow clay with small specs of charcoal inside. The mound had one indication of a grave excavation below the <b>original</b> forest <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> {{near the center of}} the mound. In this grave was “Burial No. 17”, the body had been covered by large stones.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason for}} the stack being left is uncertain. Some {{theories}} state {{that it was a}} landmark for shipping, whilst other theories include it being a memorial to the quarry workers who moved so much material from the site, or that it was simply to highlight the large amount of stone taken from the area, recording the <b>original</b> natural <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{ambulatory}} {{ran around}} {{the outside of the}} <b>original</b> apse below <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b> Originally steps led down to the ambulatory, which was covered by a barrel vault. The purpose of this ambulatory was probably to house or provide access to preserved relics.|$|R
2500|$|The current {{ground level}} of Ozone Park is {{about four feet}} higher than the <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b> Initially the avenues and cross streets were raised above ground level {{and then all of}} the basements were set on ground level and the land was back filled around the houses.

50|$|The convalescent wards are two storey masonry {{buildings}} with hipped corrugated iron roofs. The red-brown English bond facebrick walls are relieved with banding at sill and floor level, contrasting lintels and multi-paned sash and frame windows. The first floor retains its symmetrical L-shape but later single storey masonry wings containing additional bathroom and recreation {{areas have been}} added to the east and south elevations (the north elevation of Ray House) breaking the continuity of the <b>original</b> surrounding <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> verandahs and restricting views.|$|R

40|$|M. Sc. This study {{focuses on}} the {{rehabilitation}} of borrow pits on linear pipeline projects. In the past {{there have been many}} attempts to rehabilitate borrow pits to an ecological acceptable manner. Recently legislation has become more stringent regarding mine closure and rehabilitation. With the introduction of the new Mineral and Petroleum Development Act (MPRDA 28 of 2002), there has been an increase of awareness towards the immediate environment. As this project was a challenge in itself, there were no clear and concise methods in the Act that provide guidelines for final rehabilitation. Normally borrow pits as used on road concessions for material sourcing is left as different landforms like before excavation. The main {{reason for this is that}} materials are removed from the pits and not replaced, resulting in areas that are usually lower than their <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> <b>levels.</b> Some unwanted screened material will return to these borrow pits but will not complement what the original level should be. These borrow pits are usually clearly visible as low lying areas filled with water alongside roads. The Vaal River Eastern Subsection Augmentation Project (VRESAP) pipeline borrow pits were unique in the sense that not only material from screening activities were replaced, but also material excavated from the trench were replaced into the borrow pits. What makes this study unique is the fact that an opportunity was presented and clearly stipulated by the standard environmental management plan (SEMP) that borrow pits had to be filled back to their <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> <b>levels</b> or an acceptable level agreed on by the landowner. With this unique project, unique problems arose causing excess material amounting to 327 700 m³, available from the pipeline cavity. External spoil areas had to be promulgated and managed as part of site. This study through its various elements addresses some of the main problems encountered on VRESAP by looking at soil analysis, monitoring regimes, pre and post land use and other mechanisms from literature studies used on similar projects in the mining industry. vii The study also provides recommendations to the reader for future pipeline developments as well as conclusions made by the author. The recommendations made, include ways of rehabilitation planning through trials and errors made on site. Various conclusions were made that would substantiate this study in perspective to user-friendly and practical approaches...|$|R

50|$|The Survivors' Staircase was {{the last}} visible {{remaining}} <b>original</b> structure above <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> at the World Trade Center site. It was originally two outdoor flights of granite-clad stairs and an escalator that connected Vesey Street to the World Trade Center's Austin J. Tobin Plaza. During the September 11 attacks, the stairs served as an escape route for hundreds of evacuees from 5 World Trade Center, a 9-floor building adjacent to the 110-story towers. The staircase is now an important feature of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.|$|R
50|$|The {{lower course}} of this L Plan Castle is the <b>original</b> 14th-century <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> of the Clan Fraser towerhouse. On this level are a dungeon, guard room, storerooms, a chamber for merchants and {{visitors}} waiting to see the Laird, and a medieval kitchen. In the medieval kitchen the interior wall is over five metres thick, accommodating a hidden staircase and affording bearing strength to support the upper levels. A long hall passageway was constructed as a barrel vaulted design. The dungeon is noted for its small window and still has the large steel hinges to which the dungeon door would have attached. The medieval kitchen has its original 14th-century flagstones; moreover, this room features a large walk-in fireplace with a secret spiral staircase that servants would have used in medieval times to carry meals to the higher levels. (Servants at that time would have not been allowed on the main staircases used by the nobility who dwelt in the castle.) Ownership of the castle and lands passed to the Hays in the 15th century probably associated with the same real estate transaction of the lands of Ury in 1413 AD.|$|R
25|$|During {{reclamation}} work, the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> {{was raised}} by approximately , with mud and silt from dredging work. Early houses had their ground floors below the now raised ground level; some had steps built down from road level.

25|$|By {{multiplying}} these modules into a grid, {{the structure}} could be extended virtually infinitely. In its <b>original</b> form, the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> of the Crystal Palace (in plan) measured 1848' x 456', which equates to a grid 77 modules long by 19 modules wide. Because each module was self-supporting, Paxton {{was able to}} leave out modules in some areas, creating larger square or rectangular spaces within the building to accommodate larger exhibits. On the lower level these larger spaces were covered by the floor above, and on the upper level by longer spans of roofing, but the dimensions of these larger spaces were always multiples of the basic 24' x 24' grid unit. The modules were also strong enough to be stacked vertically, enabling Paxton to add an upper floor that nearly doubled the amount of available exhibition space. Paxton also used longer trellis girders to create a clear span for {{the roof of the}} immense central gallery, which was 72 feet wide and 1800 feet long.|$|R
40|$|The C 42 + {{molecules}} with Td or D 4 h symmetry {{should take}} place Jahn-Teller distortion Based on Jahn-Teller effect theory and quantum theory, the Jahn-Teller distortion and the energy level splitting of the T*(e+l 2) system for C 42 + molecules with Td symmetry are studied in this paper by using the methods of group theory and symmetry analysis. The Hamiltonian {{of the system is}} separated into two parts by using unitary shift transformation, one part is the Hamiltonian of not having phonons excited, and the other part is the Hamiltonian of having phonons excited. From this, the ground states and their energies of the system in each minimum are obtained, and the corresponding excited states and their energies are also calculated, the Jahn-Teller distortion of the system is analyzed further by using group theory afterwards. It is found that there are six potential energy minima with C 2 symmetry on the potential energy surface of the system because of the vibronic coupling. No matter which minimum the system is in, the <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> energy <b>level</b> of the system is split into three energy levels and the electronic degeneracy of the system is completely lifted, and the energy level interval aroused due to the distortion is enlarged with strengthening of the vibronic coupling strength. The symmetry of C 42 + molecules should be lowered to C 2 from Td with the Jahn-Teller distortion occurring, the symmetry of the ground electronic state of C 42 + molecules is B 2 under the group C 2 after the Jahn-Teller distortion...|$|R

Opisana je izdelava energetskih nasipov, jet {{grouting}} slopov, postopki injektiranja in podrobno sidranja, saj je njihova prisotnost pri izgradnji varnih gradbenih jam vse večja. Ker se v gradbenih jamah pojavlja tudi talna voda, so predstavljeni načini omejevanja dotoka talne vode, ki omogočajo izvedbo gradbenih del pod prvotnim nivojem talne vode. Pri obravnavanem praktičnem primeru smo analizirali stabilnostne razmere pri izvedbi globoke gradbene jame za potrebe HE Mokrice na reki Savi. Upoštevali smo vplive izlivne in talne vode ter podali zasnovo podpornih ukrepov, ki lahko zagotavljajo varno in ekonomično izvedbo zahtevnih objektov ob sedanji strugi reke Save pri Mokricah.

50|$|This {{population}} explosion looked quite “American” to contemporaries; it determined Ludwigshafen's character as a “worker's city”, and created problematic shortages {{of housing and}} real estate. The solution was {{the expansion of the}} municipal area and the incorporation of the two nearest villages, Friesenheim and Mundenheim, in the years 1892 and 1899. In the area between the city centre and those two suburbs new quarters (“North” and “South”) were built after (then) modern urban development plans. Because the ground was marshy and too low to be protected from Rhine floods, all the new houses were built on raised ground, sometimes as high as 5 metres above the original ground. Visitors can see the <b>original</b> <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> in many backyards of Ludwigshafen, which are sometimes two floors below street level.|$|E
