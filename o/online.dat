5|$|For some, {{being a part}} of a {{community}} is an important resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although <b>online</b> communities exist, affiliation with <b>online</b> communities vary. Some question the concept of <b>online</b> community, while others depend on the <b>online</b> asexual community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott posits that there has always been an asexual element in the population, but that asexual people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, the anonymity of <b>online</b> communication and general popularity of social networking <b>online</b> has facilitated the formation of {{a community}} built around a common asexual identity.|$|E
