When the Militesi Empire launches {{an assault on the}} other Crystal States of Orience, seeking to control their respective crystals, Class Zero is mobilized for the defense of Rubrum. Eventually, the group becomes entangled in the secrets behind both the war and the reason for their existence. The setting and presentation were inspired by historical documentaries, and the story itself was written to be darker than other Final Fantasy titles.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1990s, NSB had {{initiated}} {{a program to}} replace the traditional locomotive and carriage trains with new, tilting multiple units. This had led {{to the order of}} sixteen Class 73 four-car units for the three mainline routes on the Bergen Line, Dovre Line and Sørland Line. To supplement this, the board of NSB decided on 14 November 1996 to purchase seven tilting diesel multiple units for the Røros and Rauma Lines. The choice fell <b>on</b> <b>Class</b> 93, with fifteen units eventually delivered. This allowed all passenger trains on diselized lines to either be operated with Class 93 be hauled by the Di 4.

40|$|The model-checking {{problem for}} a logic LLL {{is the problem of}} decidig for a given formula phi in LLL and {{structure}} AA whether the formula is true in the structure, i. e. whether AA models phi. 	 Model-checking for logics such as First-Order Logic (FO) or Monadic Second-Order Logic (MSO) has been studied intensively in the literature, especially in the context of algorithmic meta-theorems within the framework of parameterized complexity. However, in the past the focus of this line of research was model-checking <b>on</b> <b>classes</b> of sparse graphs, e. g. planar graphs, graph classes excluding a minor or classes which are nowhere dense. By now, the complexity of first-order model-checking <b>on</b> sparse <b>classes</b> of graphs is completely understood. Hence, current research now focusses mainly <b>on</b> <b>classes</b> of dense graphs. 	 In this talk we will briefly review the known results <b>on</b> sparse <b>classes</b> of graphs and explain the complete classification of classes of sparse graphs on which first-order model-checking is tractable. In the second part we will then focus on recent and ongoing research analysing the complexity of first-order model-checking <b>on</b> <b>classes</b> of dense graphs...|$|R

During his stay in Concord, he became friends with Ralph Waldo Emerson and got to know the other Transcendentalists.

25|$|Sodium bicarbonate, {{regular or}} {{ordinary}} used <b>on</b> <b>class</b> B and C fires, {{was the first}} of the dry chemical agents developed. In the heat of a fire, it releases a cloud of carbon dioxide that smothers the fire. That is, the gas drives oxygen away from the fire, thus stopping the chemical reaction. This agent is not generally effective <b>on</b> <b>class</b> A fires because the agent is expended and the cloud of gas dissipates quickly, and if the fuel is still sufficiently hot, the fire starts up again. While liquid and gas fires do not usually store much heat in their fuel source, solid fires do. Sodium bicarbonate was very common in commercial kitchens before the advent of wet chemical agents, but now is falling out of favor, as it is much less effective than wet chemical agents for class K fires, less effective than Purple-K for class B fires, and is ineffective <b>on</b> <b>class</b> A fires.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the parameterized complexity of generalisations and {{variations of the}} dominating set problem <b>on</b> <b>classes</b> of graphs that are nowhere dense.

This generalises known results about the dominating set problem <b>on</b> $H$-minor free <b>classes,</b> classes with locally excluded minors and classes of graphs of bounded expansion. A key feature of our proof is that it is based simply on the fact that these graph classes are uniformly quasi-wide, and does not rely on a structural decomposition.
