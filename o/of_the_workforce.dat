5|$|Another of Harrison's goals was {{to raise}} the morale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workforce</b> and {{locomotive}} engineers; crews {{were assigned to the}} same locomotives, and senior engineers were allowed to paint their names on their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20percent, but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff, with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales. Other efforts to improve morale included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents.|$|E
5|$|Between the 16th {{century and}} the mid-19th century, Britain saw a large {{increase}} in agricultural productivity and net output. New agricultural practices like enclosure, mechanization, four-field crop rotation to maintain soil nutrients, and selective breeding enabled an unprecedented population growth to 5.7 million in 1750, freeing up a significant percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workforce,</b> and thereby helped drive the Industrial Revolution. The productivity of wheat went up from about 19 bushels per acre in 1720 to around 30 bushels by 1840, marking a major turning point in history.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Goldschmidt {{brokered}} {{agreements between}} business, labor and insurance interests {{that changed the}} state's workers' compensation regulations. Workers' compensation has been a contentious issue in Oregon for some time, as the state-run State Accident Insurance Fund (SAIF) insures approximately 35% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workforce.</b> The legislature passed a law as a result. The changes were considered to benefit the insurance industry and business interests, {{at the expense of}} claimants, who were required to establish more extensively that their employers were responsible for injuries. The issue was contentious for some time, involving lawsuits and various efforts to modify the law. In 2000, Governor John Kitzhaber attempted to reform the system again. This led to a new law in the 2001 Legislature, which was complicated by an Oregon Supreme Court ruling that occurred during deliberations.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the First World War, Britain's economy enjoyed a brief boom. Businesses rushed to replenish stocks and re-establish peacetime conditions of trade, and while prices rose rapidly, wages rose faster and unemployment was negligible. By April 1920 this boom had given way to Britain's first post-war slump, which ushered in an era of high unemployment. Britain's adoption of generally deflationary economic policies, including a return to the gold standard in 1925, helped to ensure that the percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workforce</b> without jobs remained at around 10% for the rest of the 1920s and beyond, well above the normal pre-war levels.
