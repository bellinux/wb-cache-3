25|$|Historians Keith Thomas and {{his student}} Alan Macfarlane {{revolutionized}} {{the study of}} witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from anthropology. They argued that English witchcraft, like African witchcraft, was endemic rather than epidemic. Older women were the favorite targets because they were marginal, dependent {{members of the community}} and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt, and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community. Witchcraft accusations were the village's reaction to the breakdown of its internal community, coupled with the emergence of a newer set <b>of</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> was generating psychic stress.|$|E

25|$|Measuring {{the spin}} of these {{entangled}} particles along anti-parallel directions—i.e., {{along the same}} axis but in opposite directions, the set of all results is perfectly correlated. On the other hand, if measurements are performed along parallel directions they always yield opposite results, and the set of measurements shows perfect anti-correlation. This is {{in accord with the}} above stated probabilities of measuring the same result in these two cases. Finally, measurement at perpendicular directions has a 50% chance of matching, and the total set of measurements is uncorrelated. These basic cases are illustrated in the table below.

25|$|Medical {{ethics is}} a system of moral {{principles}} that apply values {{to the practice of}} clinical medicine and in scientific research. Medical ethics allow for people, regardless of background, to be guaranteed quality and principled care. This applies to both the living and nonliving, such as medical research on cadavers. It creates an obvious guideline to follow. Medical ethics is based on a set <b>of</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> professionals can refer to in the case of any confusion or conflict. These values include the respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice. These tenets allow doctors, care providers, and families to create a treatment plan and work towards the same common goal without any conflict. It {{is important to note that}} these four values are of equal worth.|$|E
500|$|Synth-pop {{was defined}} by its primary use of synthesizers, drum {{machines}} and sequencers, sometimes using them to replace all other instruments. Borthwick and Moy have described the genre as diverse but [...] "...characterised by a broad set <b>of</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> eschewed rock playing styles, rhythms and structures", which were replaced by [...] "synthetic textures" [...] and [...] "robotic rigidity", often defined by {{the limitations of the}} new technology, including monophonic synthesizers (only able to play one note at a time).|$|E

Specific types of sustainability include, sustainable agriculture, sustainable architecture or ecological economics. Understanding sustainable development is important but without clear targets an unfocused term like [...] "liberty" [...] or [...] "justice".

The Vidiians were featured in an earlier season one episode titled [...] "". Biller explained that Klingons were shown to be more resistant [...] to disease than other species in previous Star Trek installments, and reasoned that a Vidiians scientist would view them as a promising way to discover a cure for the disease. Biller {{said that he had}} difficulty writing Sulan as a sympathetic villain. He looked to Gene Roddenberry's approach to portraying antagonists in the Star Trek franchise: [...] "liens should never be patently evil.

500|$|Definitions of {{the niche}} {{date back to}} 1917, but G. Evelyn Hutchinson made {{conceptual}} advances in 1957 by introducing a widely adopted definition: [...] "the set of biotic and abiotic conditions in which a species is able to persist and maintain stable population sizes." [...] The ecological niche is a central concept in the ecology of organisms and is sub-divided into the fundamental and the realized niche. The fundamental niche is the set of environmental conditions under which a species is able to persist. The realized niche is the set of environmental plus ecological conditions under which a species persists. The Hutchinsonian niche is defined more technically as a [...] "Euclidean hyperspace whose dimensions are defined as environmental variables and whose size {{is a function of}} the number <b>of</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> the environmental values may assume for which an organism has positive fitness." ...|$|E

500|$|Together {{with his}} sister's fiancé, William Meredith, Disraeli {{travelled}} widely in southern Europe and beyond in 1830–31. The trip was financed partly by another high society novel, The Young Duke, written in 1829–30. [...] The tour {{was cut short}} suddenly by Meredith's death from smallpox in Cairo in July 1831. Despite this tragedy, {{and the need for}} treatment for a sexually transmitted disease on his return, Disraeli felt enriched by his experiences. [...] He became, in Parry's words, [...] "aware <b>of</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> seemed denied to his insular countrymen. The journey encouraged his self-consciousness, his moral relativism, and his interest in Eastern racial and religious attitudes." [...] Blake regards the tour as one of the formative experiences of Disraeli's whole career: [...] "he impressions that it made on him were life-lasting. They conditioned his attitude toward {{some of the most important}} political problems which faced him in his later years—especially the Eastern Question; they also coloured many of his novels." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the writing}} and {{development}} of the episode [...] "Faces", executive story editor Kenneth Biller had difficulty writing the primary Vidiian character as a sympathetic villain. He looked to Gene Roddenberry's approach to portraying antagonists in the Star Trek franchise: [...] "liens should never be patently evil. They may have a set <b>of</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> differ from our own, but be careful of making them mustache-twirling villains." [...] Taylor used the following description to summarize the show's approach to the alien species:Initially called the [...] "Phages", the show's producers changed the alien species' name to the [...] "Vaphorans". Following the completion of the script for the debut episode, the species' name was revised again to [...] "Vidiians" [...] to prevent potential pronunciation issues for the cast. Introduced in the first season, the Vidiians were developed as one of three new alien species that could be used as recurring antagonists; the other two were the Kazon and the [...] The Vidiians and the Kazon would be featured in later episodes, while the appearance of the Sikarians was restricted to the episode [...] "".|$|E

50|$|The Subjective Theory <b>of</b> <b>Value</b> is a Theory <b>of</b> <b>Value</b> <b>that</b> {{believes}} <b>that</b> an items <b>value</b> {{depends on}} the consumer. This theory states <b>that</b> an items <b>value</b> is not dependent on the labor that goes into a good, or any inherent property of the good. Instead, the Subjective Theory <b>of</b> <b>Value</b> believes <b>that</b> a good’s <b>value</b> {{depends on the}} consumers wants and needs. The consumer places a value on an item by determining the marginal utility, or additional satisfaction of one additional good, of that item and deciding what that means to them.|$|R
50|$|Austrian economists {{advocate}} methodological individualism {{in interpreting}} economic developments, the subjective theory <b>of</b> <b>value,</b> <b>that</b> money is non-neutral, and emphasize the organizing {{power of the}} price mechanism (see economic calculation debate) and a laissez faire approach to the economy.|$|R
50|$|Marx {{believed}} that {{the extension of the}} labor theory <b>of</b> <b>value</b> (the theory <b>of</b> <b>value</b> used by Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, etc.) indicated capitalists (owners of the means of production) would exploit workers by depriving them <b>of</b> <b>value</b> <b>that</b> workers themselves create. According to Marx, surplus value is the difference between the <b>value</b> <b>that</b> the worker has created and the wage that the worker receives from his/her employer.|$|R

In Ethics (1912), Moore rejected a purely hedonistic utilitarianism and argued that there is a range <b>of</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> might be maximized.

2500|$|The {{principle}} was formulated as {{a response}} to a series of observations that the laws of nature and parameters of the universe take on values that are consistent with conditions for {{life as we know it}} rather than a set <b>of</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> would not be consistent with life on Earth. [...] The anthropic principle states that this is a necessity, because if life were impossible, no living entity would be there to observe it, and thus would not be known. That is, it must be possible to observe some universe, and hence, the laws and constants of any such universe must accommodate that possibility.|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} {{achievement of}} UCERF is development of system-level approach called the [...] "grand inversion". This uses a supercomputer {{to solve a}} system of linear equations that simultaneously satisfies multiple constraints such as known slip rates, etc. The result is a model (set <b>of</b> <b>values)</b> <b>that</b> best fits the available data. In balancing these various factors it also provides an estimate of how much seismicity is not accounted for in the fault model, possibly in faults not yet discovered. The amount of slip occurring on unidentified faults has been estimated at between 5 and about 20mm/yr depending on the location (generally higher in the LA area) and deformation model, with one model reaching 30mm/yr just north of LA.|$|E
2500|$|Standard {{deviation}} {{may serve}} as a measure of uncertainty. [...] In physical science, for example, the reported standard deviation of a group of repeated measurements gives the precision of those measurements. [...] When deciding whether measurements agree with a theoretical prediction, the standard deviation of those measurements is of crucial importance: [...] if the mean of the measurements is too far away from the prediction (with the distance measured in standard deviations), then the theory being tested probably needs to be revised. This makes sense since they fall outside the range <b>of</b> <b>values</b> <b>that</b> could reasonably be expected to occur, if the prediction were correct and the standard deviation appropriately quantified.
