Hemsworth and Hiddleston reprise their roles as Thor and Loki, respectively, along with <b>others</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first film. Christopher Eccleston joins the cast as the Dark Elf Maletkith.|$|E
5|$|Cetaceans {{are divided}} into two parvorders: the largest parvorder, Mysticeti (baleen whales), is {{characterized}} by the presence of baleen, a sieve-like structure in the upper jaw made of keratin, which it uses to filter plankton, among <b>others,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> water; Odontocetes (toothed whales) are characterized by bearing sharp teeth for hunting, as opposed to their counterparts' baleen.|$|E

5|$|A {{survey in}} 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire {{recorded}} seven 17th and 18th century memorials within the church, {{the oldest in}} memory of a Thomas Owen who died in 1646. The tombs in the churchyard include one of a Sidney Griffith (died 1618) and more than 20 <b>others</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 17th and 18th centuries. The survey also noted some oak dog tongs, likely {{to be from the}} 19th century, and three 17th-century chairs.|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt was}} made to provide the {{completed}} Arrows to the National Research Council of Canada as high-speed test aircraft. The NRC refused, noting that without sufficient spare parts and maintenance, as well as qualified pilots, the NRC could make no use of them. A similar project initiated by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (Boscombe Down) had resulted in Avro vice-president (engineering) Jim Floyd's preparing a transatlantic ferry operation. This proposal, like <b>others</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States, was never realized.|$|E

5|$|Between 1916—when the {{university}} introduced a Doctorate of Philosophy for research—and 1939, {{there were few}} post-graduate students, and {{only one or two}} undergraduates took Arabic in final examinations each year. The subject grew in popularity after the Second World War: Gibb had an international reputation that attracted foreign students, while <b>others</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom who had spent time in the Middle East during the war were interested in studying Arabic language and culture. Julia Bray, the current holder , was appointed in 2012. She is the 15th Laudian Professor, and the first woman to hold the position. She {{is a member of the}} Faculty of Oriental Studies, based at the Oriental Institute, and is one of about 25 faculty members in the Islamic World Subject Group.|$|E
5|$|Between his {{coronation}} and 1071, William consolidated {{his hold}} over England, defeating {{a number of}} rebellions that arose particularly {{in the north and}} west of the country. Immediately after Hastings, only those English noblemen who fought in the battle lost their lands, which were distributed to Normans and <b>others</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> continent who had supported William's invasion. The rebellions of the years 1068 to 1071 led to fresh confiscations of English land, again distributed to William's continental followers. By 1086, when William ordered the compilation of Domesday Book to record landholders in England, most of the native English nobility had been replaced by Norman and other continental nobles.|$|E
5|$|Dubourdieu (as commodore) led a {{squadron}} consisting of six frigates (four of 40 guns {{and two of}} 32 guns), a 16-gun brig, two schooners, one xebec, and two gunboats. Three of his ships were from the French Navy, and the <b>others</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Navy of the Kingdom of Italy. In addition the squadron carried 500 Italian soldiers. In the absence of Montagu, Hoste's squadron consisted of three frigates (one of 38 guns and two of 32 guns) and one 22-gun post ship. The island of Lissa itself was defended by {{a small number of}} local troops under the command of two midshipmen.|$|E

5|$|Internationally, Aulie {{played in}} the 2009 World Junior Championships, where he paired with Tyler Myers on defence and helped Canada capture a gold medal. He {{was traded to the}} Toronto Maple Leafs in trade for Dion Phaneuf, among <b>others,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Flames during the 2009–10 season. Aulie made his NHL debut with the Maple Leafs in November 2010. Off the ice, Aulie was honoured by the Canadian Red Cross for saving his father after he fell through ice on the family farm.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that spring}} Bryant and Reed heeded Vorse's call {{to spend the}} warm season in Provincetown, Massachusetts, {{at the tip of}} Cape Cod, and {{to take part in the}} {{communal}} theater productions of the Provincetown Players. <b>Others</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Village went as well and joined the group, organized in 1915 by George Cram Cook and his wife, Susan Glaspell, who hoped to produce plays that were both political and artistic. Among the works the group staged in 1916 were Bryant's The Game, in which characters named Life and Death play dice for the lives of Youth (a poet) and Girl (a dancer). It appeared on the same bill as Not Smart by Wilbur Steele and Bound East for Cardiff by O'Neill.|$|E
5|$|Shehri was an {{elementary}} school teacher from Khamis Mushait in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia. In early 2000 he traveled to Medina to seek treatment for mental problems. He and his younger brother Waleed traveled to Afghanistan in March 2000 and joined an Al-Qaeda training camp. The brothers were chosen, along with <b>others</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same region of Saudi Arabia, to participate in the September 11 attacks. Once selected, Shehri returned to Saudi Arabia in October 2000 to obtain a clean passport, then returned to Afghanistan. In March 2001, he recorded his last will and testament on video.|$|E

5|$|The Alliance devises {{a plan to}} {{halt the}} Shivan {{invasion}} while evacuating civilians and <b>others</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Capella star system, by collapsing the two jump nodes from Capella {{to the rest of}} GTVA space. The Alliance plans to recreate the same conditions that collapsed the Sol jump nodes—namely a sufficiently powerful meson explosion, using a number of Great War-era destroyers, including the Bastion, which the GTVA send out to collapse the Capella–Epsilon Pegasi node by detonating its payload while it is within the node.|$|E
5|$|The United States Attorney for Washington then filed a suit {{to enforce}} the treaty rights of the tribe. The trial {{court held that the}} {{property}} rights of the Winans allowed them to exclude <b>others</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> property, including the Indians. In 1905, the United States Supreme Court reversed that decision, holding that the tribe had reserved fishing rights when they ceded the property to the United States. Since the tribes had the right to fish reserved in the treaties, the federal government and subsequent owners had no greater property rights than were granted by the treaties.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began as}} a {{long-range}} gunnery duel, during which the Russian ships hit the Japanese ships numerous times and forced Tōgō to temporarily disengage. Over two hours {{after the start of}} the battle, the Japanese fleet closed the range and started shooting again at 17:35. Forty minutes later a shell struck Retzivans forward turret near the gun ports, killing one turret crewman and wounding six <b>others</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> blast pressure. The impact knocked one 12-inch shell off its loading tray, crushing two other sailors and also setting fire to the canvas covering the gun ports. Fearing that the fire might spread, the surviving crewmen flooded the turret, knocking out its electrical system. The crew was able to get the turret partially functional within an hour.|$|E

5|$|There are 37 Grade I listed {{buildings}} in North Somerset, including the Clifton Suspension Bridge, which joins North Somerset to Bristol and Clevedon Pier {{which was built}} between the 1860s and 1890s. It was removed following damage in 1970 and restored, before being rebuilt and reopened {{to the public in}} 1998. Of the listed buildings, manor houses are well represented. They include Clevedon Court, built in the 14th century, and from the 15th century, Ashton Court and Nailsea Court. North Somerset has many religious structures; the largest number are from the Norman or medieval eras. The oldest is the Church of St. Quiricus and St. Julietta in Tickenham which dates from the 11th century, and there are 8 <b>others</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Tipu's Tiger has {{provided}} inspiration to poets, sculptors, artists and <b>others</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth {{century to the}} present day. The poet John Keats saw Tipu's Tiger at the museum in Leadenhall Street and worked it into his satirical verse of 1819, The Cap and Bells. In the poem, a soothsayer visits the court of the Emperor Elfinan. He hears a strange noise and thinks the Emperor is snoring.|$|E
5|$|Weidling {{had given}} the order for the {{survivors}} to break out to the north-west; the plan got underway at around 23:00. The first group from the Reich Chancellery, led by Mohnke, tried but could not break through the Soviet rings and was captured the next day. Like <b>others</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Führerbunker who were captured, he was interrogated by SMERSH. On the third break-out attempt from the Reich Chancellery, made around 01:00 (2 May), Bormann managed to cross the Spree. Arthur Axmann, who followed the same route, reported seeing Bormann's body {{a short distance from}} the Weidendammer bridge.|$|E
