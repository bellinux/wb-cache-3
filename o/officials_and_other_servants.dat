Maxwell's initial interest was in training all undergraduates for their roles as informed citizens in the American democracy; University officials convinced him the school should also provide professional training for future government <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> public <b>servants.</b>|$|R
40|$|U radu se obrađuje utjecaj pripadnosti velikaškim družinama na društveni položaj pripadnika srednjeg i nižeg plemstva i njihovih obitelji. Pri tome oni nisu gubili svoj plemićki status niti druge vrste plemićkih sloboda koje su inače uživali, što je moglo dovoditi do sukoba s njima nadređenim velikašima. Naglasak je stavljen na utjecaj teritorijalnog faktora kao odlučujućeg za sklapanje klijentelskog odnosa. Ti će problemi biti promatrani na primjerima velikaških obitelji Zagrebačke županije za vladavine Žigmunda Luksemburškog. Retainers {{and clients}} {{made up the}} human {{resources}} on which magnates relied when maintaining and administering their estates, in addition to performing political, military and judicial functions on the state level. The system {{was based on the}} custom that lesser nobles entered the service of the magnates, who then rewarded them for their services with direct pay or various different forms of protection and support. Belonging to a noble family influenced the social climbing of members of the middle and lesser noble strata and their families. The question that arises is whether territorial factors were determinative in sealing client relations with the magnates of the county or whether lesser nobles could enter the service of other magnates of the kingdom regardless of such factors. Retainers could perform many functions, from those of castellans to those of <b>officials,</b> judges <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>servants</b> (as can be found in sources under the Latin terms castellanus, officialis, villicus, iudex). Another question is whether the network of retainers was well developed, because in theory and in practice, the familiares might have had their own retainers on the lower level. Their relations could have had a permanent or a temporary basis. Under them were placed men, mostly tenant-peasants <b>and</b> <b>other</b> peasants on estates (homines, iobagiones, populi), who usually participated in the activities of their commanders. They were all part of the group of individuals united on a permanent basis, {{in spite of the fact}} that they could shift allegiances, at least in theory. Cases of individuals who changed lords several times during their lifetimes in the area of the county of Zagreb (always, however in their close vicinity) show that the network of retainers was a part of a complex system organised as a pyramid, where the base was wide, comprising many individuals, while at the top there was only one man (in the person of a castellan or a magnate himself) ...|$|R

Tribals are having their own culture, beliefs, religious identity etc. , and anybody's attempt to bring some changes to it is always resisted by them. The same thing happened, when the administration tried to bring reformatory and correctional changes into their society. That led to Tribal resistance Movement , which was an essential part of Indian Freedom Movement. There are a number of distinguished tribal leaders have played their heroic role in this movement, but the role played by Laxman Naik is incomparable , more inspiring and edifying [...] The brave fighter fought single handedly with consummate skill and extraordinary passion against the cruel British administration. He was a man of immense courage, rock solid and inspiration for countless followers. He could have led a comfortable life inherited from his ancestors. But he has sacrificed it for the freedom of his mother land. He always stood like a mountain in the way of British administration and neither gave up nor bend before the cruelty of foreign rule.|$|E
