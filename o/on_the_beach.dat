5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} his release, Van der Sloot gave several interviews that explained {{his version of}} events. The most notable discussion included a lengthy interview with Fox News that aired over three nights in March 2006. During the interview, Van der Sloot indicated that Holloway wanted {{to have sex with}} him, but he did not because he didn't have a condom. Van der Sloot stated that Holloway wanted them to stay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> but that {{he had to go to}} school in the morning. According to Van der Sloot, he was picked up by Satish Kalpoe at about 3:00am and left Holloway sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> In August 2005, David Kock, Satish Kalpoe's attorney, stated that his client had gone to sleep, and had not returned to drive Van der Sloot home. Van der Sloot stated that he was somewhat ashamed to have left a young woman alone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> albeit by her own request, and related that he was not truthful at first because he was convinced that Holloway would soon turn up.|$|E

5|$|Argento {{reportedly}} {{offered the}} lead role of Peter Neal to Christopher Walken, but eventually it went to Anthony Franciosa. Kim Newman felt that Franciosa's casting was fortunate, as {{he was capable of}} bringing more to the role than the script asked of him. He also believed that if Walken had been cast, it would have been more obvious that he was the killer. According to Jones and Daria Nicolodi, the relationship between Franciosa and Argento was a fractious one. In addition, Nicolodi and Argento were romantically involved at the time, but their relationship had suffered over a disputed story credit during the filming of Suspiria. Nicolodi therefore only agreed to a brief appearance in Tenebrae. By her own account, she originally asked for the small role of Jane McKerrowwhich ultimately went to Veronica Lario. Nicolodi was, according to Alan Jones, cast as the woman <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> in Neal's flashback. Conversely, Thomas Rostock opines that Nicolodi was never intended for that role, only that of Jane. Transgender actress Eva Robin's was later hired to play the woman <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b>|$|E
