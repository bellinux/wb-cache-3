40|$|Composite {{materials}} are seeing increasing {{use in the}} engineering industry, in particular the aerospace sector. The move towards light weight high stiffness structures that have good durability and corrosion resistance {{has led to the}} move from metal structures to composite structures. With this brings the added concern of certifying new components as they must meet the same structural integrity, safety and durability requirements as those in metals and hence this is where the challenge now lies. When a metallic structure is damaged at some point during its life, there is a possibility it will be repaired however if the damage is significant then the component(s) will be replaced. With composite materials on the other hand, the flexibility in design and fabrication has led to larger single component pieces and thus repairing these structures is more economical than replacement. This puts further emphasis in creating new and efficient repair methods that can be certified whilst still withstanding the various stresses and loads inflicted on the aircraft during its remaining service life. In this study, a comparison is made between three fundamental joint structures - mechanically fastened joints, bonded joints and hybrid joints. The work is targeted towards the repair of aircrafts made from fibre reinforced polymer matrix composites known for their high strength, high stiffness, long fatigue life and low density. Stage 1 of the investigation focused on testing thin double lap joint repairs and Stage 2 focused on testing thick step lap joint repairs containing a total of five steps. The aim was to compare the static strength and fatigue resistance of a hybrid joint configuration consisting of both bonding and fastening, a purely fastened joint and a purely bonded joint. Rivets and countersunk bolts were selected as the fasteners for thin and thick joint repairs respectively. The effect of changing various parameters such as the mechanical fastener array, clamping pressure, bond strength, initial defects and curing conditions were also investigated. The experimental results for both Stage 1 and Stage 2 found {{there was no significant difference}} between the static strength of a bonded joint compared to a hybrid joint. However, the fatigue resistance of a hybrid joint was superior to a bonded joint configuration particularly where bondline defects such as initial cracks or a semi-cured adhesive was present. Finite element analysis (FEA) was also performed to verify the static and fatigue strength of the various configurations. Nonlinear adhesive material properties, fastener surface contacts and frictional forces were all included in the three-dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) models. The Multicontinuum Theory (MCT) is used to simulate the progressive failure process and determine the stress states in the various specimen configurations. The strain energy release rate (SERR) as a function of crack length for the bonded and hybrid specimens were also compared. Results found that it was vital to position fasteners closer towards the ends of the bondline to suppress rapid crack growth. As soon as a crack enters the fasteners’ clamping zone, there is a significant drop in the SERR which reduces the crack growth rate, leading to an improvement in fatigue resistance. The key advantage in this case, is being able to detect damage before catastrophic failure. A final extension to the investigation looked into optimising the individual step length, step heights and the number of steps for the thick joint repair cases. The previous step lap joint containing five steps with a 90 mm long overlap was able to achieve only a 52 % load recovery at best compared to a pristine undamaged parent structure. Through the parametric studies conducted using Abaqus CAE, two new step lap joint designs were numerically analysed and experimentally tested. One of the optimised step lap joint designs contained seven steps (with thin outer step heights and thicker inner step heights) and the second contained six steps (with an <b>outer</b> <b>overlap).</b> Overall, the static and fatigue resistance was improved in both of the new step lap joint designs. A bonded step lap joint with seven steps was now able to achieve a 70 % load recovery with a 95 % increase in fatigue resistance. Overall the work discussed as part of this dissertation provides detailed methods in optimising composite joint repair whilst providing benchmark comparisons between thin and thick fastened, bonded and hybrid joint cases. This is an area of research which has seen limited attention in the past but is crucial for the continual growth of composite material usage in both commercial and military sectors. Achieving composite joint repair certification is a stringent and costly process, through this research various methods have been presented to not only improve repair durability but to assist damage detection and prevent final catastrophic failure, all of which will greatly assist composite repair certification...|$|E

Such spaces possess effective negative charges (in view of electronegativity of S atoms in heteronuclear As–S bond), which makes them preferential traps due to attractive potential for positrons [3, 28]. Similar free-volume configurations are supposed to be characteristic for many other arsenic sulfide compounds such as crystalline pararealgar As 4 S 4, orpiment As 2 S 3, or even near-stoichiometric glassy As–S, ensuring close similarity in their defect-related lifetimes in 0.34 – 0.37  ns domain [3, 25, 28 – 30]. An alternative channel of positron annihilation is expected in realgar α-As 4 S 4 for Ps decaying in free volumes derivative from crystallographic-specific packing of cage-like As 4 S 4 molecules. However, overall Ps yield in realgar is rather small (2 – 3  %) [25]; thus, the detected PAL spectra are dominated by preferential positron trapping.|$|R

Initially, L 3 growth cones project to a common domain in the <b>outer</b> medulla, <b>overlapping</b> with the growth cones of other neurons destined for a different layer through the redundant functions of N-Cadherin (CadN) and Semaphorin- 1 a (Sema- 1 a).

Subsequently, L 3 growth cones segregate from the domain into their target layer in part through Sema- 1 a/PlexA-dependent remodeling. Together, our results and recent studies argue that the early medulla is organized into common domains, comprising processes bound for different layers, and that discrete layers later emerge through successive interactions between processes within domains and developing layers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Increasing {{recording}} {{track density}} by allowing overlap of adjacent tracks {{can lead to}} substantial increase in storage density for magnetic recording. However, track overlap may cause severe inter-track interference (ITI) and result in loss of performance. Sophisticated signal processing techniques must then be used to recover this loss. We study the use of joint equalization and decoding for magnetic recording with overlapping tracks. We present results for a scheme that uses minimum meansquared-error (MMSE) equalization in conjunction with error correction coding using low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The recording process is simulated using a micromagnetic model for longitudinal magnetic recording. We use a three track system to study the track <b>overlap.</b> The <b>outer</b> two tracks are allowed to overlap on the middle track to simulate ITI. Bit error rate simulations show that the MMSE-LDPC decoding scheme incurs negligible loss when each of the <b>outer</b> tracks <b>overlap</b> 10 % on the middle track. By varying the recording parameters, the tradeoff between storage density and performance is also studied. We show that by a judicious choice of LDPC codes a recording with track overlap can have better performance than {{when there is no}} overlap. Hence, a higher storage density can be obtained without loss in performance.

50|$|Capuchin monkeys inhabit a large {{range of}} Brazil {{and other parts}} of Latin and Central America. Capuchin monkeys often live in large groups of 10 to 35 {{individuals}} within the forest, although they can easily adapt to places colonized by humans. Usually, a single male will dominate the group, and they have primary rights to mate with the females of their group. However, the white-headed capuchin groups are led by both an alpha male and an alpha female. Each group will cover a large territory, since members must search for the best areas to feed. These primates are territorial animals, distinctly marking a central area of their territory with urine and defending it against intruders, though <b>outer</b> areas may <b>overlap.</b> The stabilization of group dynamics is served through mutual grooming, and communication occurs between the monkeys through various calls. Capuchins can jump up to nine feet (three meters), and they use this mode of transport to get from one tree to another.

30|$|The {{interference}} scenario II {{refers to}} the interference from downlink HeNB to MUE. With hybrid spectrum arrangement, different portions of spectrum are dedicated to macrocells and inner femtocells. Thus, an MUE does not suffer much downlink interference from a HeNB when it lies within the coverage an inner femtocell, {{regardless of whether the}} femtocell operates in the closed-access or open-access manner. Whereas when a MUE lies within the coverage of a closed-access outer femtocell and its ID is not in the authorized list of the CSG femtocell, the MUE suffers high downlink interference from HeNB because the spectrum used by the <b>outer</b> femtocell is <b>overlapped</b> with that used by MUEs. The problem is severer when an MUE lies within the indoor coverage of outer femtocell due to the near-far effects. In this case, an indoor MUE at the macro cell edge receives highly attenuated signal from the eNB with wall penetration loss, but receives excessive interference signal originating from a HeNB directly without such penetration loss. Consequently, “dead zone” exists for an MUE when it lies too close to an indoor HeNB: a connection can not be established with eNB or an ongoing connection between an MUE and its serving eNB can be interrupted.|$|R
40|$|Neural {{networks}} receive input that {{is transformed}} before being sent as output to higher centers of processing. These transformations are often mediated by local interneurons (LNs) that influence output based on activity across the network. In primary olfactory centers, the LNs that mediate these lateral interactions are extremely diverse. For instance, the antennal lobes (ALs) of bumblebees possess both γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) - and histamine-immunoreactive (HA-ir) LNs, {{and both are}} neurotransmitters associated with fast forms of inhibition. Although the GABAergic network of the AL has been extensively studied, we sought to examine the anatomical features of the HA-ir LNs {{in relation to the}} other cellular elements of the bumblebee AL. As a population, HA-ir LNs densely innervate the glomerular core and sparsely arborize in the <b>outer</b> glomerular rind, <b>overlapping</b> with the terminals of olfactory receptor neurons. Individual fills of HA-ir LNs revealed heavy arborization of the outer ring of a single “principal” glomerulus and sparse arborization in the core of other glomeruli. In contrast, projection neurons and GABA-immunoreactive LNs project throughout the glomerular volume. To provide insight into the selective pressures that resulted in the evolution of HA-ir LNs, we determined the phylogenetic distribution of HA-ir LNs in the AL. HA-ir LNs were present in all but the most basal hymenopteran examined, although there were significant morphological differences between major groups within the Hymenoptera. The ALs of other insect taxa examined lacked HA-ir LNs, suggesting that this population of LNs arose within the Hymenoptera and underwent extensive morphological modification. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{suite of}} {{algorithms}} are presented which facilitate the identification and tracking of storm–indicative features, such as mean sea-level pressure minima, in high resolution regional climate data. The methods employ a hierarchical triangular mesh, which is tailored to the regional climate data by only subdividing triangles, from an initial icosahedron, within {{the domain of the}} data. The regional data is then regridded to this triangular mesh at each level of the grid, producing a compact representation of the data at numerous resolutions. Storm indicative features are detected by first subtracting the background field, represented by a low resolution version of the data, which occurs at a lower level in the mesh. Anomalies from this background field are detected, as feature objects, at a mesh level which corresponds to the spatial scale of the feature being detected and then refined to the highest mesh level. These feature objects are expanded to an <b>outer</b> contour and <b>overlapping</b> objects are merged. The centre points of these objects are tracked across timesteps by applying an optimisation scheme which uses of five hierarchical rules. Objects are added to tracks based on the highest rule in the scheme they pass and, if two objects pass the same rule, the cost of adding the object to the track. An object exchange scheme ensures that adding an object to a track is locally optimal. An additional track optimisation phase is performed which exchanges segments between tracks and merges tracks to obtain a globally optimal track set. To validate the suite of algorithms they are applied to the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset and compared to other storm–indicative feature tracking algorithms...|$|R
