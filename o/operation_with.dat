40|$|Fractions {{represent}} {{the manner of}} writing parts of whole numbers (integers). Rules for <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> fractions differ from rules for <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> integers. Students face difficulties in understanding fractions, especially <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> fractions. These difficulties are well known in didactics of Mathematics throughout the world {{and there is a}} lot of research regarding problems in learning about fractions. Methods for facilitating understanding fractions have been discovered, which are essentially related to visualizing <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> fractions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The article defines {{algebraic}} semantics of singular (call-time-choice) and plural (run-time-choice) nondeterministic parameter {{passing and}} presents a specification {{language in which}} <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> both kinds of parameters can be defined. Sound and complete calculi for both semantics are introduced. We study {{the relations between the}} two semantics and point out that axioms for <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> plural arguments may be considered as axiom schemata for <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> singular arguments...|$|R
40|$|Multi-party local quantum <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> shared quantum {{entanglement}} or shared classical randomness are studied. The following facts are established: (i) There is {{a ball of}} local <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> shared randomness lying within the space spanned by the no-signaling operations and centred at the completely noisy channel. (ii) The existence of the ball of local <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> shared randomness is employed {{to prove that the}} weak membership problem for local <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> shared entanglement is strongly NP-hard. (iii) Local <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> shared entanglement are characterized in terms of linear functionals that are ``completely'' positive on a certain cone K of separable Hermitian operators, under a natural notion of complete positivity appropriate to that cone. Local <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> shared randomness (but not entanglement) are also characterized in terms of linear functionals that are merely positive on that same cone K. (iv) Existing characterizations of no-signaling operations are generalized to the multi-party setting and recast in terms of the Choi-Jamiolkowski representation for quantum super-operators. It is noted that the standard nonlocal box {{is an example of a}} no-signaling operation that is separable, yet cannot be implemented by local <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> shared entanglement.

These operations take very long time. The Czech accounting standard No. 011 is a directory statute recommending how to account <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> company. The Comercial Code and the Civil Code contain juridical aspects of transactions with company. Man have to known the tax problems of <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> company too. <b>Operations</b> <b>with</b> company may seem very difficult but on the other side man can dispose of the whole firm on the basis of one contract. It is easy, comfortable, fast, cheaper and profitable. Man can find selling of company and hiring of company in the praxi in the practical part of the thesis. Problems of <b>operations</b> <b>with</b> company are presented by SACH, spol. s r. o. and Podblanicko Louňovice, a. s. Both companies account transactions with company according to the Czech accounting standard No. 011.

5|$|According to Walter Bolliger, {{development}} of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996. In 1999, the world's first Floorless Coaster opened at Six Flags Great Adventure as Medusa. In 2009, the coaster was renamed Bizarro and re-themed. After the success of Bolliger & Mabillard's prototype Floorless Coaster, SeaWorld, Cedar Fair, Six Flags, and independent parks, Janfusun Fancyworld, Parque Warner Madrid, Tivoli Gardens, and Ocean Park Hong Kong have built other coasters of this model at their parks. There are currently 14 Floorless Coasters in <b>operation</b> <b>with</b> Dominator being the only one relocated to another park.|$|E
5|$|Ace, {{along with}} Ballantine Books, {{was one of}} the leading science fiction {{publishers}} for its first ten years of <b>operation.</b> <b>With</b> the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, Donald A. Wollheim and Terry Carr, left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to Grosset & Dunlap. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third Ace Science Fiction Specials series, for which Carr was the editor. Further mergers and acquisitions resulted in the company becoming a part of Berkley Books. Ace then became an imprint of Penguin Group (USA).|$|E
5|$|After {{an initial}} victory against Persian forces at the Battle of the Granicus, Alexander {{accepted}} {{the surrender of}} the Persian provincial capital and treasury of Sardis; he then proceeded along the Ionian coast, granting autonomy and democracy to the cities. Miletus, held by Achaemenid forces, required a delicate siege <b>operation,</b> <b>with</b> Persian naval forces nearby. Further south, at Halicarnassus, in Caria, Alexander successfully waged his first large-scale siege, eventually forcing his opponents, the mercenary captain Memnon of Rhodes and the Persian satrap of Caria, Orontobates, to withdraw by sea. Alexander left the government of Caria {{to a member of}} the Hecatomnid dynasty, Ada, who adopted Alexander.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, a degaussing coil was installed just above the waterline to protect the ship from magnetic mines. Her first wartime operation saw her participating in laying a minefield off the German coast in the North Sea on 3 September. She conducted the <b>operation</b> <b>with</b> the other light cruisers Nürnberg, Leipzig, Köln, and Königsberg and sixteen destroyers. After laying her first set of mines, she returned to Wilhelmshaven to restock her mines. While moored in the harbor, she was attacked by British bombers on 4 September; German anti-aircraft gunners shot down {{four of the five}} Blenheim bombers, one of which inadvertently crashed into the ship. Twenty-nine men were killed or wounded in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the rapid}} {{collapse}} of the KPA, China's Chairman Mao Zedong ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to be reorganized into the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) for the upcoming intervention in Korea. Despite Mao's determination to save North Korea from capitulation, the Chinese military leadership expressed doubts {{on the ability of}} the Chinese army to fight against the more modernized US forces. As a compromise, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead building <b>operation</b> <b>with</b> limited offensives against only the South Korean forces while avoiding contacts with the US forces.

5|$|By 4:00 AM on October 16, Reshef's brigade, {{which had}} begun the <b>operation</b> <b>with</b> 97 tanks, had lost 56 in just twelve hours of fighting, leaving only 41 remaining. Although seizing the {{crossing}} site had been accomplished easily, stiff resistance had prevented Reshef from achieving his remaining objectives, namely opening the routes to the canal and securing a corridor. Reshef's force would further drop to just 27 tanks by noon. As a whole, Sharon's division suffered some 300 killed and 1,000 wounded that night. To help Reshef secure the corridor, Sharon supplied him with two tank battalions by 6:00 PM, propping his numbers up to 81 tanks.|$|E

The NRX reactor provided Britain, the United States and Canada with a source of fissile plutonium and uranium-233. It also provided a means of efficiently producing medical isotopes like phosphorus-32, research facilities that for a time were superior to those in the United States, and a wealth of technical information related to reactor design and <b>operation.</b> <b>With</b> the passage of the Canadian Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the responsibility for the Chalk River Laboratories passed to the Atomic Energy Control Board.|$|E

5|$|For many years, the United States {{produced}} more than 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while extraction plants in Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in Arzew, Algeria, producing 17million cubic meters (600million cubic feet) began <b>operation,</b> <b>with</b> enough production to cover all of Europe's demand. Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the U.S. had risen to more than 15 million kg per year. In 2004–2006, additional plants in Ras Laffan, Qatar, and Skikda, Algeria were built. Algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium. Through this time, both helium consumption {{and the costs of}} producing helium increased. From 2002 to 2007 helium prices doubled.|$|E
