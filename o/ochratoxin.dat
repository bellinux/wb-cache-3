Although the microbes responsible have proved highly variable from region to region and even factory to factory, the key organism found and responsible for almost all pu'er fermentation has been identified in numerous studies as Aspergillus niger, with some highlighting the possibility of ochratoxins produced by the metabolism of some strains of A.niger having a potentially harmful effect through consumption of pu'er tea.

40|$|Mycotoxins – {{from the}} Greek μύκης (mykes, mukos) “fungus” and the Latin (toxicum) “poison” – {{are a large}} and growing family of {{secondary}} metabolites and hence natural products produced by fungi, in particular by molds (1). It is estimated that well over 1, 000 mycotoxins have been isolated and characterized so far, but this number will increase {{over the next few}} decades due the availability of more specialized analytical tools and the increasing number of fungi being isolated. However, the most important classes of fungi responsible for these compounds are Alternaria, Aspergillus (multiple forms), Penicillium, and Stachybotrys. The biological activity of mycotoxins ranges from weak and/or sometimes positive effects such as antibacterial activity (e. g. penicillin derivatives derived from Penicillium strains) to strong mutagenic (e. g. aflatoxins, patulin), carcinogenic (e. g. aflatoxins), teratogenic, neurotoxic (e. g. <b>ochratoxins),</b> nephrotoxic (e. g. fumonisins, citrinin), hepatotoxic, and immunotoxic (e. g. <b>ochratoxins,</b> diketopiperazines) activities (1, 2), which are discussed in detail in this volume...|$|R
50|$|Citrinin often occurs {{together}} with other mycotoxins like <b>ochratoxin</b> A or aflatoxin B1, because they are produced by the same fungi species.

The effects of co-occurrence of these mycotoxins are either additive or synergistic. The nephrotoxic effects of <b>ochratoxin</b> A and citrinin, for example, are increased synergistic when exposure to both takes place.

Other organizations have established even lower limits for intake of <b>ochratoxin</b> A, based on the consumption habits of the population. For USA, the FDA considers a TDI of 5 ng/kg. In the US, mean body weight for men is 86 kg, and for women 74 kg. Hence, the TDI for men is 430 ng and for women is 370 ng. In the joined table [...] "weight in kg" [...] is the weight eaten per day {{of each of the}} listed foodstuffs. Diet 1, with small quantities of ginger, nutmeg, and paprika, a good serving of dry raisins, a reasonable amount of coffee, cereals, wine, pulses, and salami, amounts to a safe diet (as for <b>ochratoxin,</b> at least), with 286 ng per day. However, {{it would be easy to}} go into excessive levels (Diet 1+), just by eating 200 g of pig kidney and 200 g of peanuts, which would lead to a total of nearly 462 ng of <b>ochratoxin.</b> This shows how delicate a safe diet can be.

Mycotoxins subject to government regulation in most countries include aflatoxins, fumonisins, <b>ochratoxins,</b> deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, and patulin, produced by species of Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Penicillium.
