5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential for negative consequences as a result <b>of</b> <b>leverage</b> and allocation building {{in the form of}} buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, if the price of a security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require the portfolio manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E

25|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>leverage</b> is also {{reflected}} in the pricing of options written on leveraged ETFs. In particular, the terminal payoff of a leveraged ETF European/American put or call depends on the realized variance (hence the path) of the underlying index. The impact <b>of</b> <b>leverage</b> ratio can also be observed from the implied volatility surfaces of leveraged ETF options. For instance, the implied volatility curves of inverse leveraged ETFs (with negative multipliers such as -1, -2, or -3) are commonly observed to be increasing in strike, which is characteristically different from the implied volatility smiles or skews seen for index options or non-leveraged ETF options.|$|E

25|$|McCulley {{writes that}} the {{progression}} through Minsky's three borrowing stages was evident as the credit and housing bubbles built through approximately August 2007. Demand for housing was both a cause and effect of the rapidly expanding shadow banking system, which helped fund the shift to more lending of the speculative and ponzi types, through ever-riskier mortgage loans at higher levels <b>of</b> <b>leverage.</b> This helped drive the housing bubble, as the availability of credit encouraged higher home prices. Since the bubble burst, {{we are seeing the}} progression in reverse, as businesses de-leverage, lending standards are raised and the share of borrowers in the three stages shifts back towards the hedge borrower.|$|E

[...] Carter's proposals did not achieve support from the business community or Congress and were not enacted.

500|$|According to a 2011 {{article in}} Investments & Pensions Europe, the risk parity {{approach}} has [...] "moderate risks" [...] which include: [...] communicating its value to boards of directors; [...] unforeseen {{events like the}} 2008 market decline; market timing risks associated with implementation; the use <b>of</b> <b>leverage</b> and derivatives and basis risks associated with derivatives. Other critics warn that the use <b>of</b> <b>leverage</b> and relying heavily on fixed income assets may create its own risk. Portfolio manager Ben Inker has criticized risk parity for being a benchmarking approach that gives too much relative weight to bonds {{when compared to other}} alternative portfolio approaches. However, proponents of risk parity say that its purpose is to avoid predicting future returns. Inker also says that risk parity requires too much leverage to produce the same expected returns as conventional alternatives. Proponents answer that the reduced risk from additional diversification more than offsets the additional leverage risk and that leverage through publicly traded futures and prime brokerage financing of assets also means a high percentage of cash in the portfolio to cover losses and margin calls. Additionally Inker says that bonds have negative skew, (small probability of large losses and large probability of small gains) which makes them a dangerous investment to leverage. Proponents have countered by saying that their approach calls for reduced exposure to bonds as volatility increases and provides less skew than conventional portfolios.|$|E

500|$|While Archimedes did not {{invent the}} lever, he gave an {{explanation}} of the principle involved in his work On the Equilibrium of Planes. Earlier descriptions of the lever are found in the Peripatetic school of the followers of Aristotle, and are sometimes attributed to Archytas. According to Pappus of Alexandria, Archimedes' work on levers caused him to remark: [...] "Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth." [...] (...) Plutarch describes how Archimedes designed block-and-tackle pulley systems, allowing sailors to use the principle <b>of</b> <b>leverage</b> to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move. Archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the catapult, and with inventing the odometer during the First Punic War. The odometer was described as a cart with a gear mechanism that dropped a ball into a container after each mile traveled.|$|E

500|$|This {{strategic}} selection also {{applied to}} the pitchers, as Stengel leveraged his staff, starting his best pitchers against the best opponents. Although Stengel {{is best known for}} doing this with the Yankees, he also did it in his days managing Brooklyn and Boston, and to a very limited extent with the Mets. Rather than have a regular pitching rotation to maximize the number of starts a pitcher will have, Stengel often rested pitchers longer to take advantage of situational advantages which he perceived. [...] For example, Stengel started Eddie Lopat against Cleveland whenever possible, because he regularly beat them. Stengel's 1954 Yankees had the highest [...] sabermetrics measurement <b>of</b> <b>Leverage</b> Points Average of any 20th century baseball team. [...] Leveraging became unpopular after choices of starting pitchers based on it backfired on Lopez in the 1959 World Series and on Stengel in the following year's—he waited until Game 3 to start Whitey Ford because he felt Ford would be more effective at Yankee Stadium rather than at the small Forbes Field. Ford pitched two shutouts, including Game 6 at Forbes Field, but could not pitch in the Yankees' Game 7 loss. Stengel's philosophy took another blow in 1961 when Houk used Ford in a regular rotation and the pitcher went 25–4 and won the Cy Young Award—he had never won 20 games under Stengel. Today, teams prefer, for the most part, a regular rotation.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, {{although}} {{hedge funds}} {{go to great}} lengths to reduce the ratio of risk to reward, inevitably a number of risks remain. Systemic risk is increased in a crisis if there is [...] "herd" [...] behaviour, which causes a number of similar hedge funds to make losses in similar trades. In addition, while most hedge funds make only modest use <b>of</b> <b>leverage,</b> hedge funds differ from many other market participants, such as banks and mutual funds, in that there are no regulatory constraints on their use <b>of</b> <b>leverage,</b> and some hedge funds seek large amounts <b>of</b> <b>leverage</b> as part of their market strategy. [...] The extensive use <b>of</b> <b>leverage</b> can lead to forced liquidations in a crisis, particularly for hedge funds that invest at least in part in illiquid investments. The close interconnectedness of the hedge funds with their prime brokers, typically investment banks, can lead to domino effects in a crisis, and indeed failing counterparty banks can freeze hedge funds. These systemic risk concerns are exacerbated by the prominent role of hedge funds in the financial markets. [...] The global hedge fund industry has over $2 trillion in assets, and this does not take into account the full effect <b>of</b> <b>leverage,</b> which by definition is market exposure in excess of the amount invested.|$|E

40|$|Leveraged loans {{have reached}} new {{peaks in the}} post-crisis period. This Article assesses U.

First, the current regulatory strategy, which relies on institutions to set their own definitions of and standards for leveraged lending activities, magnifies regulatory conflicts that are inherent in a fragmented regulatory structure like the United States. Second, the institution-based regulatory boundaries in leveraged loan regulation create regulatory gaps and exclude a significant number <b>of</b> <b>leveraged</b> loans, particularly in the market 2 ̆ 7 s riskiest segments, from regulatory oversight. Third, the regulatory focus on protecting individual institutions from the risks <b>of</b> <b>leveraged</b> lending may inadequately protect or even undermine the safety and soundness of the financial system. To manage these blindspots, the Article suggests a shift from an institution-based toward a loan-based perspective in the regulation <b>of</b> <b>leveraged</b> loans, and describes how this regulatory shift could be achieved by relying on the regulatory infrastructure enabled by the passage of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act...|$|R
