5|$|Born in Chicago, Emanuel is a {{graduate}} of Sarah Lawrence College and Northwestern University. Working early in his career in Democratic politics, Emanuel was appointed as director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finance</b> <b>committee</b> for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. In 1993, he joined the Clinton administration, where he served as the assistant to the president for political affairs and as the senior advisor to the president for policy and strategy before resigning, in 1998.

5|$|In Massachusetts, the {{lieutenant}} governor does not preside over the state Senate, {{as is the case}} in many other states; nevertheless, as lieutenant governor, Coolidge was a deputy governor functioning as administrative inspector and was a member of the governor's council. He was also chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finance</b> <b>committee</b> and the pardons committee. As a full-time elected official, Coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton. McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917. When McCall decided that he would not stand for a fourth term, Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for Villiers, {{his case}} {{was not to}} be prosecuted with the utmost rigour. He was to some degree {{protected}} by the joint efforts of Boringdon's friends and the Whig George Tierney, as well as his own quick action in surrendering his property through writs of extent; and the delinquency of Joseph Hunt, Treasurer of the Ordnance attracted attention and saved Villiers from the full wrath <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finance</b> <b>committee.</b> Their report on the matter noted that the writ of extent had been to the amount of £264,000, but only £91,000 had been raised from the sale of his property, and about £30,000 from securities and the bond posted for him when he took office. The committee recommended the abolition of the office of Paymaster of Marines and the transfer of its duties to the Treasurer of the Navy, a recommendation which was not immediately acted upon. Villiers was left, in Boringdon's estimation, with a debt of £1,500–2,000, an annual income of £2,000–3,000, and the property in Cranbourne Lodge.|$|E

25|$|Cabinet Committees {{will often}} discuss matters {{referred}} to them by Cabinet itself, and then report back {{the results of their}} deliberation. This can sometimes become a powerful tool for advancing certain policies, as was demonstrated in the Lange government. Roger Douglas, Minister of Finance, and his allies succeeded in dominating the finance committee, enabling them to determine what it recommended to Cabinet. The official recommendation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finance</b> <b>committee</b> was much harder for his opponents to fight than his individual claims in Cabinet would be. Douglas was able to pass measures that, had Cabinet deliberated on them itself rather than pass them to Committee, would have been defeated.|$|E

25|$|While the Liverpool dispute {{was still}} {{unresolved}} {{at the end}} of May 1984 there was already pressure on the left-wing leadership of Lewisham London Borough Council to copy the Liverpool option and confront the Government with a deficit budget. At a meeting of Labour controlled London boroughs in mid-June, the idea of a united strategy of many councils refusing to levy a rate was introduced. The idea caught on, especially with the leaders of the four South London boroughs of Lambeth, Southwark, Lewisham and Greenwich, and with John McDonnell, chair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finance</b> <b>committee</b> of the Greater London Council. On 22 June 1984, they signed a statement published in Labour Herald which outlined the strategy.|$|E
25|$|Hampton reappointed Delany as a trial justice {{but white}} Democrats soon {{replaced}} Delany.

In reaction to whites' regaining power and the suppression of black voting, Charleston-based blacks started planning again for emigration to Africa. In 1877, they formed the 'Liberia Exodus Joint Stock Steamship Company', with Delany as chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finance</b> <b>committee.</b> A year later, the company purchased a ship, the Azor, for the voyage led by Harrison N. Bouey. He {{served as president of the}} board to organize the voyage.|$|E
25|$|Ford gave up an {{executive}} position in heavy truck program management to become chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finance</b> <b>committee</b> on the Board of Directors, a non-executive corporate governance position.

Ford added {{the title of}} Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2001, following the ouster of then-CEO Jacques Nasser. That ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values—Nasser focused on maximizing corporate profits and shareholder value, while Ford was noted for valuing people and tradition. With the retirement of Ford President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed those roles as well.

25|$|In {{the middle}} of March the {{district}} auditor, Brian Singleton, {{sent a letter to}} every councillor warning them of the legal dangers of delaying setting a rate. At a special council meeting called by the Conservative group on 22 March 1985, the Labour chair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Committee</b> Harry Rutherford proposed an £83m budget which included uncommitted growth of only £300,000 instead of the £4.2m wanted by the Leader; he attracted the support of the opposition Conservative and Alliance councillors together with 12 other Labour rebels and the budget was passed. The chief whip of the Labour group Stephen Byers said that the auditor would have to check the budget was legal.
