5|$|Mason {{became the}} first Liberal to be elected {{councillor}} for Ashton-under-Lyne in 1856. He was mayor of the council from 1857 to 1860 and retired from local politics in 1874 due to conflict with his <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> Mason returned to the Liberals in 1878 when he stood for election as Member of Parliament for Ashton-under-Lyne. He was voted in and supported progressive policies, which included women's suffrage, making him unpopular within his <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> He was MP from 1880 to 1885. When he died in 1886, aged 69, Hugh Mason had amassed £290,933 (now about £17million).|$|E
5|$|Since it {{was dropped}} as the {{official}} emblem of Belarus, opposition {{groups such as the}} Belarusian People's Front have used the Pahonia as part of their <b>own</b> <b>party</b> symbols or used them as a form of protest against Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko.|$|E
5|$|The {{country is}} divided into 15 electoral {{district}}s. (Åland is the only single member electoral district and it also has its <b>own</b> <b>party</b> system.) The electoral districts are shown below.|$|E
50|$|Continental Finnish {{political}} parties {{do not operate}} in Åland, and instead the region has its <b>own</b> <b>parties.</b> Elections to the Parliament are contested through common lists.|$|R
50|$|MacWEEKs {{party at}} Macworld Conference & Expo {{was named for}} this fictional character. The party was often more secretive than Apples <b>own</b> <b>parties,</b> to protect the {{identity}} of the Knife.|$|R
50|$|Between 1990 and 1992, Ludzhev was {{a member}} of the UDF, but after that founded his <b>own</b> <b>parties</b> and {{political}} coalitions such as the Union for National Salvation (Bulgarian: Обединение за национално спасение).|$|R
5|$|Mason's {{policies}} {{led him to}} {{come into}} constant clashes with the Conservative members of the council. He was not always popular within his <b>own</b> <b>party</b> either and he even financed his own newspaper, the Ashton-under-Lyne News, to convey his views and provide competition for the pro-Liberal Ashton Reporter. Conflict with the Liberals drove Mason into early retirement from local politics in 1874 {{at the age of}} 57.|$|E
5|$|Taloustutkimus {{carried out}} monthly {{telephone}} polls on party popularity for the Finnish Broadcasting Company. Since April 2007, the monthly sample size has varied between 2,900–3,900 with {{a margin of}} error of about ±1.8%. (Polling does not include Åland as it has its <b>own</b> <b>party</b> system.) However, there were also other less frequent opinion polls.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the Prime Minister's <b>own</b> <b>party</b> was {{breaking}} down underneath him. There {{had been no}} official party platform yet agreed to, and individual members had a wide degree of latitude to determine the issues they ran on, leading to frequent government defections on legislation. The government's existing nine-seat majority shrank during 1928 and 1929 over various issues, {{as a result of}} by-elections, and several leading figures who had previously worked with Bruce became increasingly sharp critics of him. Hughes and Edward Mann were two of the government's most ardent opponents in 1929.|$|E
50|$|He was Mayor of Hamilton, New Zealand from 1968 to 1976, when he {{resigned}} {{to become a}} Member of Parliament. He strongly opposed many of the policies of his <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> leader, Robert Muldoon.|$|R
5000|$|Jeffries {{was born}} in 1944, the son of Shirley and Donald R. Jeffries (1918-1985). Born in Oklahoma, {{he grew up in}} Los Angeles, California where his father <b>owned</b> <b>Party</b> Time, a chain of party supply stores.|$|R
5000|$|Johan George [...] "Jan" [...] Nagel (born 20 June 1939) is a Dutch {{politician}} {{who was a}} member of the Labour Party, and later formed his <b>own</b> <b>parties.</b> He is currently in the Pensioners' Party 50PLUS.|$|R
5|$|Governors who had {{previously}} been legislators have generally had greater success in achieving their legislative goals while governor. Three speakers of the house have become governor. Governor Joseph A. Wright had the worst relations of any governor with the assembly. He twice delivered speeches to a joint session where he harangued them for what he perceived to be corruption, accusing them of taking bribes from the Bank of Indiana. The legislature responded by overriding all his anti-banking vetoes. He was so disliked by his <b>own</b> <b>party</b> that he was expelled from it after his term.|$|E
5|$|In 1847 a small {{political}} crisis occurred which removed Bentinck from {{the leadership and}} highlighted Disraeli's differences with his <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> In that year's general election, Lionel de Rothschild had been returned for the City of London. As a practising Jew he could not take the oath of allegiance in the prescribed Christian form, and therefore could not take his seat. Lord John Russell, the Whig leader who had succeeded Peel as Prime Minister and like Rothschild was a member for the City of London, proposed in the Commons that the oath should be amended to permit Jews to enter Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, President Herbert Hoover {{appointed}} Stanley to the International Joint Commission, a body {{charged with}} settling boundary disputes between the United States and Canada. Stanley became its chair in 1933. He {{was very proud}} of his service on the Commission, and once noted that nowhere on earth have two great powers lived so long as neighbors with so few disputes. He served until 1954 when he resigned under pressure from his <b>own</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Conservative government's {{move was}} seen by {{opposition}} members and other observers as a partisan attempt to bankrupt the other political parties and further increase his <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> financial advantage, and as a direct attack on the democratic process.|$|R
2500|$|McKay is {{a leading}} social {{conservative}} in the Liberal Party. He strongly opposed his <b>own</b> <b>party’s</b> bill which legalised same-sex marriage in Canada in 2005. McKay is a past {{board member of the}} [...] at the University of Toronto Scarborough campus.|$|R
5|$|In the 2005 civic election, he {{was again}} elected, though his Richmond First party only won {{three of the}} eight seats. He unsuccessfully lobbied his fellow councillors to appoint him to fill one of Richmond's two seats at Metro Vancouver. With not even his <b>own</b> <b>party</b> members {{supporting}} him for the Metro Vancouver seat and finding himself being alone {{in a number of}} issues, such as supporting the SkyTrain line being elevated, opposing the tree preservation bylaw, and wanting to hire more police officers, Howard left the Richmond First party in February 2006 to be an independent.|$|E
5|$|Incumbent Republican Senator Scott Brown ran for {{re-election}} to a first full term. He {{had been elected}} in a special election in 2010 {{following the death of}} incumbent Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy. Brown faced no challengers from his <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> For the Democrats, an initial wide field of prospective candidates narrowed after the entry of Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren, the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Warren clinched near-unanimous party support, with {{all but one of the}} other Democratic candidates withdrawing following her entrance. After winning her party's nomination, eliminating any need for a primary, she faced Brown in the general election.|$|E
5|$|Labor's leader, Don Dunstan, also {{introduced}} a bill for reform of the Legislative Council, which sought to remove its wage and property based qualifications and instil adult suffrage. Hall himself stated he would approve the bill if it included a clause guaranteeing that the Legislative Council could only be abolished through a referendum. Dunstan agreed, but Hall's <b>own</b> <b>party</b> split on the issue. The bill passed the House of Assembly with Labor support, but failed in the Legislative Council where the LCL's rural conservatives dominated its restricted electoral base.|$|E
5000|$|... "Positive Strategic" [...] {{voters are}} unhappy their <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> leading candidate, {{and do not}} see their {{preferred}} alternative as viable. Thus, they cross over {{to vote for a}} candidate who they think will stand a chance in the general election.|$|R
60|$|No {{one would}} ever know what it had cost him to obtain these papers. No {{one would ever}} know how much he had sacrificed of pride, revenge and hate {{in order to save}} a few shreds of his <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> honour.|$|R
25|$|During {{the week}} many {{delegations}} have traditionally hosted their <b>own</b> <b>parties</b> {{in addition to}} the officially sponsored ones. However, in the new millennium the trend has been for the national delegations to centralise their activity and hold their celebrations in the Euroclub.|$|R
5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E
5|$|Nattrass failed a {{candidacy}} {{assessment in}} August 2013 and was duly deselected as UKIP {{candidate for the}} 2014 election, prompting him to initiate unsuccessful legal action against the party. He duly left UKIP and was in talks with the English Democrats, but cancelled plans to ally with them after they prematurely announced his joining the party. Nattrass, still a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), instead launched his <b>own</b> <b>party</b> after considering a career as an independent. An Independence Party's creation was announced in October 2013, being renamed An Independence from Europe on 7 March 2014 to avoid confusion with UKIP. Nattrass had previously considered the label 4 A Referendum. Electoral Commission records show that he had registered his <b>own</b> <b>party</b> significantly earlier, on 20 June 2012. From this date, he had also been filing financial statements for the fledgling, albeit inactive, organisation. The new party's development benefited from an incident in September 2013 when a Lincolnshire County Councillor, Chris Pain, was expelled from UKIP over an internal controversy. Fellow UKIP Councillors Alan Jesson and John Beaver supported Pain's innocence and were also expelled from the party for plotting to form a breakaway faction. All three became members of Nattrass' party and proceeded to represent their wards accordingly.|$|E
5|$|SOE agent Richard Lippett had {{obtained}} employment with the shipping company John Holt & Co (Liverpool), which had business offices on the island. Having {{taken up the}} post he started to make preparations for the raid. He became aware that the crew of Duchessa d'Aosta were {{in the habit of}} accepting invitations to parties ashore and had held their <b>own</b> <b>party</b> aboard ship on 6 January 1942. Under the guise of a party-goer Lippett managed to gain information about the readiness of the ship for sea, crew numbers, and the watch arrangements.|$|E
50|$|Albert Raney Anderson (November 8, 1837 - November 17, 1898) was a one-term U.S. Representative from Iowa's 8th congressional {{district}} in southwestern Iowa. He {{is best known}} for winning election to Congress and defeating a well-known incumbent, without winning his <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> endorsement.|$|R

50|$|In 1912, when Republicans {{were divided}} between their <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> {{candidates}} and candidates of the Bull Moose Party, Pickett ran for re-election {{to a third}} term, but was defeated by Democrat Maurice Connolly of Dubuque. In all, he served from March 4, 1909 to March 3, 1913.|$|R
5|$|The {{debate about}} {{his place in}} the Conservative pantheon has {{continued}} since his death. Disraeli fascinated and divided contemporary opinion; he was seen by many, including some members of his <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> as an adventurer and a charlatan and by others as a far-sighted and patriotic statesman. As an actor on the political stage he played many roles: Byronic hero, man of letters, social critic, parliamentary virtuoso, squire of Hughenden, royal companion, European statesman. His singular and complex personality has provided historians and biographers with a particularly stiff challenge.|$|E
5|$|The ninety-two {{peers are}} made up of three {{separate}} groups. Fifteen 'office-holders' comprise Deputy Speakers and Deputy Chairmen, and are elected by the House, while seventy-five party and Crossbench members are elected by their <b>own</b> <b>party</b> or group. In addition, there are two royal appointments: the Lord Great Chamberlain, currently the Marquess of Cholmondeley, is appointed as the Queen's representative in Parliament, while the post of Earl Marshal remains purely hereditary; the office has been held since 1672 by the Dukes of Norfolk and is responsible for ceremonies such as the State Opening of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Tătărescu {{resigned}} {{his office}} on 6 November 1947, {{and was replaced by}} the Communist Ana Pauker. For the following two months, he was sidelined in his <b>own</b> <b>party</b> by PCR pressures, and removed from its leadership in January 1948 (being replaced with Petre N. Bejan — the party was subsequently known as National Liberal Party-Petre N. Bejan). One of his last actions as cabinet member had been to sign the document officially rejecting the Marshall Plan.|$|E
50|$|Lundy is {{a member}} of the Socialist Left faction of Labor. She has been highly active on the issue of {{internet}} regulation, arguing against both the Howard government's and her <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> policy in that area. Lundy is also patron of the Canberra Rowing Club and the Pearcey Foundation.|$|R
50|$|In 1938, the new Prime Minister, Kálmán Darányi, {{decided to}} make his new {{policies}} very pro-Germany and pro-Italy, a bit like how Hoederer wanted to join with the other parties to try to evolve as a country and stay on everyone's good side to get his <b>own</b> <b>party's</b> point across.|$|R
