500|$|Besides Morrison, {{there is}} {{conflicting}} information about {{who participated in}} the session. In addition to the group's original members (guitarist Billy Harrison, bassist Alan Henderson, drummer Ronnie Millings, and keyboard player Eric Wrixon), others have been suggested: Pat McAuley on keyboards, Bobby Graham on a second drum kit, Jimmy Page on second guitar, and Peter Bardens on keyboards. As Page biographer George Case notes, [...] "There is a dispute over whether it is Page's piercing blues line that defines the song, if he only played a run Harrison had already devised, or if Page only backed up Harrison himself". Morrison has acknowledged Page's participation in the early sessions: [...] "He played rhythm guitar <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and doubled a bass riff on the other" [...] and Morrison biographer Johnny Rogan notes that Page [...] "doubled the distinctive riff already worked out by Billy Harrison". Music critic Greil Marcus comments that during the song's quieter middle passage [...] "the guitarist, session player Jimmy Page or not, seems to be feeling his way into another song, flipping half-riffs, high, random, distracted metal shavings". Them's blues-rock arrangement is [...] "now regarded justly as definitive", with [...] "much of its appeal emanat from the tingling lead guitar section", according to music writer Adam Clayson.|$|E

2500|$|After the film's poor reception, its {{financial}} disaster prompted Universal executives to void their contract with Friedkin immediately. Friedkin became overcumbered with pressure {{and moved to}} France with Moreau where he recuperated from a malaria infection contracted during the filming, and wanted to sever ties with American film industry. Despite Sorcerers failure, in an 2013 interview for The National, Friedkin stated that in retrospect he never stopped believing in the movie: [...] "I measure {{the success or failure}} of a film <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> – how close I came to my vision of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1933 Mottistone visited Berlin in his {{capacity}} as Chairman of the Air League, as a guest of Joachim von Ribbentrop. In 1935 he visited Germany again in his boat “Mayflower”. In May 1935 Adolf Hitler made a well publicised speech in which he proclaimed that German rearmament offered no threat to world peace. That month Mottistone told the House of Lords that [...] "we ought to assume that it is genuine and sincere...I have had many interviews with Herr Hitler. I think the noble Lord and all the people who have really met this remarkable man will agree with me <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> however much we may disagree about other things—that he is absolutely truthful, sincere, and unselfish".|$|E
2500|$|One of Reed's sore points {{resulting}} from that unauthorized re-editing {{was that the}} [...] "heavenly wine and roses" [...] melody was cut out of [...] "Sweet Jane". In the original recording, this part was intended to provide a perfectly flowing bridge to a full-fledged plagal cadence two-chord version of the chorus (earlier choruses in the song have a 4-chord riff). In Reed's initial solo performances, he would include the verse (see for instance American Poet), until 1973, when he would routinely leave it out, as the bridge fits less well in a more hard rock version (as heard for instance on Rock 'n' Roll Animal). However, the post-Reed, Doug Yule-led Velvets always performed the song with the verse included. A career-spanning retrospective of Reed's recordings with the Velvet Underground and as a solo artist, NYC Man (The Ultimate Collection 1967–2003), which Reed compiled himself, uses the shorter version. When asked about the shortened versions of [...] "Sweet Jane" [...] and [...] "New Age" [...] and Reed's long-standing claims that they were re-edited without his consent, Yule claimed that Reed had in fact edited the songs himself. [...] "He edited it. You have to understand at the time, the motivation was... Lou was, {{and all of us}} were, intent <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and that was to be successful and what you had to do to be successful in music, was you had to have a hit, and a hit had to be uptempo, short, and with no digressions, straight ahead basically, you wanted a hook and something to feed the hook and that was it. 'Sweet Jane' was arranged just exactly the way it is on the original Loaded release exactly for that reason—to be a hit! 'Who Loves The Sun' was done exactly that way for that reason—to be a hit." ...|$|E

Happy are they who long and labour after the true riches, which neither mobs nor tyrants, man nor devil, {{prosperity}} nor adversity, or any chance or change of mortal life, can take from them--the true and eternal wealth, which is the Spirit of God.
