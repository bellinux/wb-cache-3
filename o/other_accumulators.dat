25|$|A {{number of}} {{improvements}} {{were made to}} ENIAC after 1948, including a primitive read-only stored programming mechanism using the Function Tables as program ROM, an idea included in the ENIAC patent and proposed independently by Richard Clippinger of BRL. Clippinger consulted with von Neumann on what instruction set to implement. Clippinger had thought of a 3-address architecture while von Neumann proposed a 1-address architecture because it was simpler to implement. Three digits of one accumulator (6) were used as the program counter, another accumulator (15) {{was used as the}} main accumulator, a third accumulator (8) was used as the address pointer for reading data from the function tables, and most of the <b>other</b> <b>accumulators</b> (1–5, 7, 9–14, 17–19) were used for data memory.|$|E
5000|$|The {{feedforward}} inhibition {{model is}} similar to the mutual inhibition model, but instead of being inhibited by the current value of the <b>other</b> <b>accumulator,</b> each accumulator is inhibited by a fraction of the input to the other. It can be formally stated thus: ...|$|R

5000|$|An {{enhanced}} {{instruction set}} including single-bit addressing, shifts/rotates on memory and registers <b>other</b> than the <b>accumulator,</b> rotate instructions for BCD number strings in memory, program looping, program counter relative jumps, block copy, block input/output (I/O), and byte search instructions. The Z80 also incorporated an overflow flag and had better support for signed 8- and 16-bit arithmetics.|$|R
50|$|The common {{alternative}} to belt machines are register machines, {{in which each}} instruction explicitly names the specific registers to use for locations of operand arguments and results. Belt machines are related to stack machines, which specify both arguments and results implicitly using a pushdown stack. <b>Other</b> alternatives are <b>accumulator</b> machines, which have only one visible general-purpose temp register, and memory-to-memory machines, which have no visible temp registers.|$|R
50|$|The {{degree of}} {{generality}} of most registers are {{much greater than}} in the 8080 or 8085. However, 8086 registers were more specialized than in most contemporary minicomputers and are also used implicitly by some instructions. While perfectly sensible for the assembly programmer, this makes register allocation for compilers more complicated compared to more orthogonal 16-bit and 32-bit processors of the time such as the PDP-11, VAX, 68000, 32016 etc. On the other hand, being more regular than the rather minimalistic but ubiquitous 8-bit microprocessors such as the 6502, 6800, 6809, 8085, MCS-48, 8051, and <b>other</b> contemporary <b>accumulator</b> based machines, it is significantly easier to construct an efficient code generator for the 8086 architecture.|$|R
50|$|The storage {{word length}} is 16 bits. The {{registers}} {{have the same}} width as the address bus. Their length varies between 16, 18 and 20 bits depending {{on the amount of}} storage installed. A particular interrupt level has eight registers. Register zero is the program counter which gave the address of the next instruction to be executed; the <b>other</b> seven are <b>accumulators.</b> The four odd-numbered accumulators can be addressed as eight single-byte accumulators.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Heavy metal (HM) {{accumulator}} plants {{possess the}} ability to actively hyperaccumulate and detoxify exceptionally high concentrations of metals in their aboveground tissues, without exhibiting any apparent signs of toxicity. Despite nickel (Ni) hyperaccumulator plants representing {{the largest percentage of}} known metal accumulator taxa (over 75 %), the underlying genetic and molecular basis of Ni accumulation remains unclear. A prominent difficulty in understanding Ni hyperaccumulation has been the severe lack of intraspecific variation in the trait. Hence, the study of a single species exhibiting a significant degree of variation is highly desirable. as it avoids the use of inter-species comparative studies mostly utilized to date. The Ni hyperaccumulator Senecio coronatus (Asteraceae) has been reported to contain a significant degree of phenotypic plasticity with respect to the amount accumulated and subsequent cellular distribution of Ni. This apparent intraspecific variation means that S. coronatus may represent a useful system in which to study Ni hyperaccumulation. No population genetics study has been carried out to date on this species, and the evolutionary relationships between hyper and non- accumulator populations were unknown. Here, results are presented from a genetic analysis of 15 naturally occurring S. coronatus populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and phylogenetic analysis (based on non-coding nuclear and plastid markers) suggest that Ni accumulation may have evolved twice within S. coronatus, as hyperaccumulator plants from site Kaapsehoop, cluster with non-accumulating serpentine populations and demonstrate distinct genetic differentiation from <b>other</b> <b>accumulator</b> populations. Four populations were selected for a preliminary comparative shoot proteome analysis by means of two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 D SDS-PAGE) to identify proteins potentially involved in Ni hyperaccumulation. This analysis identiﬁed nine chloroplastic proteins involved in plant energy production and metabolism as overexpressed in hyperaccumulator plants from Agnus Mine and Kaapsehoop, compared to hypertolerant non-accumulator and non-serpentine plants from Galaxy Mine and Pullen Farm, respectively. However, no difference in photosynthetic efficiency, as determined by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, was detected between these populations...|$|R
5000|$|In 1967, Fairchild {{introduced}} the first ALU implemented as an integrated circuit, the Fairchild 3800, consisting of an eight-bit ALU with <b>accumulator.</b> <b>Other</b> integrated-circuit ALUs soon emerged, including four-bit ALUs {{such as the}} Am2901 and 74181.

These devices quickly became popular and were widely used in bit-slice minicomputers.|$|R
30|$|As indicated, {{our model}} {{is based on}} the {{agent-based}} cellular automata studied in Heim et al. (2018). There, plots of land are discussed that consist of a combination of roads, and a combination of parcels for business houses and for family houses. Parcels/houses are uniquely associated with streets. Agents (owners of parcels) can be classified according to 3 dimensions: their sales strategy (“keep” vs. “sell”), their development strategy (“built up” vs “don’t build up”) and the urgency to implement them (sell/build: “now” vs. “later”), cf. Table  1 in Heim et al. (2018). Some of these agents just want to build houses for their families, others want to reduce building cost or intend to make business with selling parcels (Seller type) or with well-timed and available houses, whereas <b>others,</b> like <b>Accumulators,</b> intend to gather a number of connected parcels to build larger resorts. The simulations are initiated by providing a certain distribution of these agent types that are randomly dispersed over the plot such that all parcels are covered.|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to {{correlate}} the concentrations of rare earth elements (REEs), speciation and bioavailability. This study was proposed to investigate the distribution of REEs in abandoned mining land in Perak, Malaysia. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used as major technique in this research. In this work, water, soil, sediment and plant samples were collected in the ex-tin mining area in Lahat, Perak, Malaysia in order to study the concentration, speciation, bioavailability and potential mobility of REEs. Water from ex-mining lakes and Kinta River was analyzed along with sediments. The results obtained revealed that the ex-mining lake water was found to be higher in REEs than that of the river water. The sediment samples were found highly accumulated with REEs. The analytical data obtained in this study was then analyzed using various chemometric methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA) and hierarchal cluster analysis (HCA). From the elemental analysis of ICP-MS, it is observed that soil samples taken from different depths in Perak were well separated into two clusters based on rare earth element concentrations and physical properties. The statistical analysis also indicated that REEs were the discriminating factors for the separation of soil samples at the depth of 0 - 20 cm from the rest. In addition, the samples taken from industrial and mining areas were clustered away from natural and residential areas, suggesting ex-mining and industries being the major source of REEs in the studied area. Different environmental impact assessments were done using enrichment factor (EF), geoaccumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor (CF) and pollution load index (PLI). Speciation study carried out for sediment and soil using sequential extraction procedures, indicate REEs mainly predominated in the adsorbed/exchangeable/carbonate fraction and in bound to silicates/residuals fraction while very small amounts of REEs were found bound to sulphides/organics and amorphous and crystalline Fe oxides. REEs were clearly separated into five fractions of sequential extractions indicating their active mobility in the environment. The data obtained successfully measures the potential mobility of REEs and significantly describe higher for light rare earth elements (LREEs) rather than heavy rare earth elements (HREEs). Bioavailability of REEs indicate most of the plants as hyperaccumulators in their root and leaves parts while <b>others</b> <b>accumulator</b> and tolerant. Transfer factor (TF), bioconcentration factor (BCF) and bioaccumulation factor (BAF) analyzed were > 1 for hyperaccumulators, making them good phytoremediators for REEs. Based on the analytical method, chemometric techniques and environmental impact factors, it can be concluded that even though physical and chemical variables vary from sample to sample, distinct separation between samples from different areas of ex-mining land can be clearly observed...|$|R

40|$|Many {{embedded}} systems use a simple pipelined RISC processor for computation and an on-chip SRAM for data storage. We present an enhancement called Intelligent SRAM (ISRAM) {{that consists of}} a small computation unit with an accumulator that is placed near the on-chip SRAM. The computation unit can perform operations on two words from the same SRAM row or on one word from the SRAM and the <b>other</b> from the <b>accumulator.</b> This ISRAM enhancement requires only a few additional instructions to support the computation unit. We present a computation partitioning algorithm that assigns the computations to the processor or to the new computation unit for a given data flow graph of a program. Performance improvement results from {{the reduction in the}} number of accesses to the SRAM, the number of instructions, and the number of pipeline stalls compared to the same operations in the processor. Experimental results on various benchmarks show up to 1. 48 × speedup with our enhancement...|$|R
5000|$|All 2-operand 8-bit {{arithmetic}} {{and logical}} (ALU) operations {{work on the}} 8-bit accumulator (the A register). For two-operand 8-bit operations, the other operand can be either an immediate value, another 8-bit register, or a memory cell addressed by the 16-bit register pair HL. The only 8-bit ALU operations that can have a destination <b>other</b> than the <b>accumulator</b> are the unary incrementation or decrementation instructions, which can operate on any 8-bit register or on memory addressed by HL, as for two-operand 8-bit operations. Direct copying is supported between any two 8-bit registers and between any 8-bit register and a HL-addressed memory cell, using the MOV instruction. An immediate value can also be moved {{into any of the}} foregoing destinations, using the MVI instruction. Due to the regular encoding of the MOV instruction (using nearly a quarter of the entire opcode space) there are redundant codes to copy a register into itself (MOV B,B, for instance), which are of little use, except for delays. However, what would have been a copy from the HL-addressed cell into itself (i.e., MOV M,M) instead encodes the HLT instruction, halting execution until an external reset or unmasked interrupt occurs.|$|R
40|$|Since 2002, {{official}} {{reserves in}} Asia have grown at an unprecedented scale, mainly as {{a by-product of}} official efforts to resist currency appreciation. Apart from the external adjustment and international political repercussions, critics have also warned of the “perils”, or unintended domestic consequences, of countering capital inflows with sterilised intervention. These warnings in the Calvo (1991) tradition are well known and frequently invoked, but to what extent have the risks cited actually materialised in Asia? This paper examines the domestic consequences in three main areas: monetary control, financial stability and central bank profitability and balance sheet risk. We find that, so far, the evidence {{has not been as}} strong or widespread as often presumed. With the exception of India, where a number of archetypal symptoms have emerged, <b>other</b> large reserve <b>accumulators</b> have not exhibited conclusive signs of difficulties. We argue that many of the assumptions underlying the Calvo-type warnings did not apply broadly to Asia. Indeed, rather than being an independent policy with consequences, we find that the large-scale reserve accumulation in Asia might be better seen {{as a consequence of the}} weakness of investment relative to savings in this decade. 1 Bank for International Settlements, Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific.

40|$|A {{herbarium}} {{survey of}} Homalium and Hybanthus species {{was successful in}} the detection of a number or accumulators of nickel. The term 'hyperaccumulator' was defined as those plant species that contain more than 1000 µg/g of nickel in their leaves on a dry weight basis. Their ability to indicate areas of specific geology and their use as indicators in mineral exploration was evaluated. All new hyperaccumulators of nickel that were 'discovered' were confined to the ultramafic complex in New Caledonia. The possible evolutionary significance of nickel accumulation in the order Violales is noted. Plant-soil relationships for three New Caledonian hyperaccumulators of nickel; Hybanthus austrocaledonicus, Homalium kanaliese and Homalium guillainii were investigated, {{and the relationship between}} nickel uptake and the uptake of other elements examined statistically. The lack of interelement relationships, both stimulatory find antagonistic, of nickel with other minerals pointed to a mechanism of accumulation dependent on organic constituents, with the absence of competition from other ions indicating the specific nature of the absorption at the root. The highly unusual accumulation of nickel in the 'latex' type exudate from the trunk of Sebertia acuminata is reported. A nickel citrato complex was isolated from the exudate and leaves of this species and identified by the use of spectrophotometry, high-voltage paper electrophoresis and gas-liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry. The complexed nickel comprises approximately 40 % of the total weight of the crude latex. Citric acid was also implicated in the chelation of nickel in several <b>other</b> New Caledonian <b>accumulators.</b> extraction procedures indicated that the nickel citrate was located primarily in the vacuoles. Nickel citrate extracts from the plant material were compared with various synthetic nickel citrate solutians by electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. Evidence for a 2 : 1 anionic citrate - nickel complex was obtained for solutions in which the mole ratio of citrate to nickel approached and exceeded 2 : 1. Gas liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used in the identification of organic acids occurring in the investigated plants. High malic and citric acid concentrations were found in the hyperaccumulator species. A good correlation between citric acid and nickel content in the leaves of a number of New Caledonian plants growing over ultrabasic substrates was found. Although nickel is translocated, and exists in the plant cell as a citrate complex, it appears unlikely that it is absorbed at the roots as such. A more specific mechanism based on the carrier concept is postulated to account for the specificity of the absorption. Nickel accumulation in the Rhodesian hyperaccumulator Pearsonia metallifera is also described. Another organic acid rather than citric acid is involved with nickel chelation. Mass spectral evidence indicated an uncommon structure. A positive identification could not be made...|$|R
