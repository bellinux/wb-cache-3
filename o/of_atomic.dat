5|$|The {{significance}} <b>of</b> <b>atomic</b> {{numbers to}} {{the organization of the}} periodic table was not appreciated until the existence and properties of protons and neutrons became understood. Mendeleev's periodic tables used atomic weight instead <b>of</b> <b>atomic</b> number to organize the elements, information determinable to fair precision in his time. Atomic weight worked well enough in most cases to (as noted) give a presentation that was able to predict the properties of missing elements more accurately than any other method then known. Substitution <b>of</b> <b>atomic</b> numbers, once understood, gave a definitive, integer-based sequence for the elements, and Moseley predicted (in 1913) that the only elements still missing between aluminium (Z=13) and gold (Z=79) were Z = 43, 61, 72 and 75, all of which were later discovered. The sequence <b>of</b> <b>atomic</b> numbers is still used today even as new synthetic elements are being produced and studied.|$|E

5|$|A period 1 {{element is}} one of the {{chemical}} elements in the first row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate periodic (recurring) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The first period contains fewer elements than any other row in the table, with only two: hydrogen and helium. This situation can be explained by modern theories <b>of</b> <b>atomic</b> structure. In a quantum mechanical description <b>of</b> <b>atomic</b> structure, this period corresponds to the filling of the 1s orbital. Period 1 elements obey the duet rule in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell. The maximum number of electrons that these elements can accommodate is two, both in the 1s orbital. Therefore, period 1 can have only two elements.|$|E
5|$|After {{the atomic}} bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Wilson helped {{organize}} the Association of Los Alamos Scientists (ALAS), which called, with a scientists' petition, for the international control <b>of</b> <b>atomic</b> energy.

5|$|All heavier {{elements}} (including those {{necessary for}} rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were {{hot enough to}} fuse helium itself. All elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2% of the mass <b>of</b> <b>atomic</b> matter in the universe.
