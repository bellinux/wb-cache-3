5000|$|The {{original}} {{name was}} [...] "Desierto de Nuestra Señora del Carmen de los Montes de Santa Fe", {{but over time}} it was modified by people in nearby communities who started calling it Desierto de los Leones. It was given the name [...] "desert" [...] due {{to the location of}} the park that was built in a place far away from the city. There are two versions that explain why people started naming it de Los Leones. The first one says that the name was given due to the large amount <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>felines</b> that lived in that region. The second version is attributed to the last name of a family that helped the religious order acquire legal possession of the property. Since the friars could not perform secular charges directly, they relied on the Leon family so that they could represent them before the Spanish Crown. While this beautiful forest served as a connector between Mexico City and Toluca, the order of barefoot Carmelites chose this place to edify a convent that served as a retirement and a place of meditation far away from the restlessness of the city. [...] The first stone was laid on January 23, 1606 which started the construction of the first convent, the 10 hermitages (El Portón, La Soledad, San José, San Elías, San Juan, Magdalena, Trinidad, Getsemaní, San Alberto y San Miguel) and the wall that encircles the area.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to report on the diversity of parasitic helminths detected in the feces <b>of</b> a <b>wild</b> <b>feline</b> in southern Brazil. Parasites were obtained from fecal samples, and four techniques were used for parasitological examination: direct examination, centrifugal flotation with zinc sulfate (Faust technique), simple sedimentation (Hoffman technique) and Baermann-Moraes. The parasites were identified through micrometry and morphology, as follows: Ancylostoma sp., Toxocara sp., Trichuridae, Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, Alaria sp., and Spirometra sp.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, studies on {{wildlife}} worldwide have discovered key epidemiological {{aspects of the}} sylvatic cycle of Toxoplasma gondii. However, despite the known role <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>felines</b> as definitive hosts in the transmission and maintenance of this parasite, few {{studies have focused on}} the involvement of these animals. Brazil exhibits the largest number of wild felid species in the Americas, all of which have a critical conservation status. However, serological detections, epidemiological studies and some molecular characterizations of T. gondii have primarily used Neotropical felid populations that are maintained in captivity, which does not reflect the disease behavior in free-living conditions. A systematic review of the worldwide scientific literature was conducted focusing on toxoplasmosis in small Neotropical felids. This review covered a number of aspects, including the state of scientific research, parasite transmission in the wild, the genetic characteristics of isolates, the relationship between these genetic characteristics and the pathogenicity of the parasite, and the risk factors linked to conflicts with humans. The present review shows the relevance of studying these felid populations based on their frequent interactions with humans in peri-urban areas and the need for further comprehensive studies to establish the real significance of T. gondii in public and animal health in tropical and temperate regions...|$|E

50|$|Wild felids {{can become}} {{infected}} {{from a variety}} of sources; the primary source is infected fecal matter. The eggs of the roundworm become infective in three to four weeks after being passed out in fecal matter. Contact with the soil, licking fur near feet, and eating a host animal (such as rodents) can also lead to infection of the felines. The consumption of infected carrion also leads to contraction of the parasites, which is some of the food that members of Felidae consume. The eggs hatch in the intestines and the larvae are then released into the cat’s digestive tract. The larvae are capable of migrating through the tissues <b>of</b> the <b>wild</b> <b>feline.</b> The larvae use the blood of the feline to lungs. From there, they move up to the trachea where they are swallowed causing hacking and other problems. The larvae can also move throughout the body and cause more damage to the infected individuals. The worms can even go into the mother’s milk and infect the young.|$|R
40|$|Feline {{calicivirus}} (FCV) and felid herpesvirus type- 1 (FeHV- 1) are {{the main}} infectious agents <b>of</b> domestic and <b>wild</b> <b>felines</b> worldwide. The FCV and FeHV- 1 viruses were isolated in Brazil in 1988 and 2012, respectively. Serology surveys were performed among domestic feline in the State of Rio Grande do Sul and among <b>wild</b> <b>felines</b> in central Brazilian States. Felines with acute or chronic infections may become carriers for both viruses and, viral transmission occurs mainly by ocular and nasal secretions. In addition, FCV may be transmitted by oropharyngeal secretion and fomites. The clinical signs commonly observed in cats are fever, sneezing, coughing and nasal and ocular discharge; however, oral lesions are restricted to FCV infection.

40|$|The Laboratory of Clinical Pathology of UNIDERP {{performs}} routine examinations, when requested, {{of animals}} from the Center for Wild Animal Rehabilitation (CRAS) of Campo Grande, MS, Brazil. During {{one of these}} routine procedures, erythrocytic parasites identified as Cytauxzoon felis-like were detected in blood smears obtained from a mountain lion (Puma concolor) with parasitemia being 20 %. No clinical alterations or infestation with ticks were observed in this animal, and hematological and serum biochemical exams showed only slight alterations. Blood and serum were collected three months later from six mountain lions housed at the CRAS and another animal tested positive for parasites in blood smears with parasitemia of 10 %, without showing any clinical, hematological or blood biochemical changes characteristic of cytauxzoonosis. This animal presented parasitemia and laboratory results slightly lower than those observed in the previous animal. Two domestic cats (Felis catus) were inoculated, but the animals did not show any clinical signs of cytauxzoonosis. The identification of this blood-borne parasite in wild felines maintained in captivity {{in the absence of}} pathogenic manifestations suggests that the mountain lion acts as a natural host for C. felis- like, or that this strain is less pathogenic.

40|$|Este estudo determinou a ocorrência de anticorpos anti-Toxoplasma gondii em população indígena do Mato Grosso, os Enawenê-Nawê. Estes habitam uma vasta região selvagem, com raros contatos com não-índios. Não apresentam animais domésticos, {{inclusive}} gatos. A dieta é baseada em insetos, mandioca, milho, mel e fungos e não se alimentam de carne, exceto de peixe. Com base no exposto, desenvolveu-se análise sorológica, por meio de ELISA - IgG e IFI - IgG e IgM. De 148 soros, 80, 4 % foram ELISA ou IFI- IgG positivos. Não foram detectados casos de IgM reagentes. Nesse grupo as taxas de soropositividade aumentaram significativamente com a idade, de 50 % a 95 %. Analisando-se os hábitos e costumes, aliados à alta soropositividade encontrada, sugere-se que a presença de felinos silvestres nas imediações da aldeia e coleções de água poderia ter papel importante como fonte de infecção, contaminando o solo e, conseqüentemente, os insetos e fungos consumidos pelos índios.

500|$|Meanwhile, the Eye wanders in {{a distant}} land—Nubia, Libya, or Punt.

In other accounts, it is Shu who searches for Tefnut, who in this case represents the Eye rather than an independent deity. Thoth, who often serves as a messenger and conciliator in the Egyptian pantheon, can also seek the wandering goddess. His role in retrieving the Eye of Ra parallels his role in the Osiris myth, in which he heals or returns Horus' lost Eye. In a Late Period papyrus dubbed [...] "The Myth of the Eye of the Sun", Thoth persuades the Eye of Ra to return through a combination of lectures, enticement, and entertaining stories.

Após realização da ovariosalpingo-histerectomia os ovários foram fixados, processados rotineiramente para a inclusão em parafina e corados com Hematoxilina-eosina. Os parâmetros morfométricos analisados foram: diâmetro (μm), área (μm 2) e perímetro (μm) dos folículos e respectivos oócitos de diferentes tipos de folículos. A relação entre o crescimento do folículo e do oócito foi analisada.

The {{relationship between the}} growth of the follicle and oocyte was analyzed. The statistical analysis were ANOVA and the means were compared by Tukey test and medians using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Background: The {{delay in}} {{development}} of artificial reproduction techniques on carnivorous {{could be due}} to countless reasons, but the lack of commercial interest is probably the most important one. The majority of canines are small structures, canidae are extremely fertile and a great number of species are adapted to domestication or captivity. Finally, the canine gamete physiology presents a difficult adaptation of technology knowledge obtained from other species. Furthermore, domestic felines are animals of company and there is no interest in reproducing them in a large scale, as it has been observed in other domestic animals, however, besides of being a valuable model for the development of in vitro techniques, the domestic cat is also used as an embryo receptor for different species <b>of</b> small <b>wild</b> <b>felines</b> due to physiological similarities among them, in vitro embrionary development, Review: It was reviewed the main insights about the reproductive physiology in female dogs, in vitro oocytary maturation (IVM), pregnancy and conception rate with dogs' frozen/unfrozen semen and PIV in domestic cats. The majority of mammal oocytes restart meiosis spontaneously after ovulation and reaches MII in artificial environment; in an in vitro maturation system in bovines, around 90 % of oocytes complete their maturation, although its development capacity can be reduced subsequently. The success of IVM in canidae have been limited, with maturation rate varying from 0 to 58 %, usually around 20 %. The greatest difficulties include oocyte quality, hormonal environment, protein supplementation, cumulus / oocyte cell interaction, donor breed and age, culture systems, oxygen tension, amino acids, growth factor and sequential means. The freezing process reduces the quality of the semen, firstly because it reduces the number of living sperms and secondly because freezing produces cell modifications that could alter the sperm motility, longevity, integrity of membranes and its fertilizing capacity. Conclusion: Nowadays, several researches are being performed with the aim of increasing viability after dogs' and cats' semen is unfrozen, using extenders, cryoprotectors, freezing and unfreezing curves, addition of antioxidant substances. The aim of this text is to inform about the improvements obtained on the artificial reproduction techniques, emphasizing the oocytary maturation in female dogs, semen cryopreservation and artificial insemination in domestic dogs and cats...|$|R

We have estimated here the gene content of Bartonella koehlerae, a novel species isolated from cats that was recently identified as an agent of human endocarditis. The investigation was accomplished by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to a microarray constructed from the sequenced 1. 93 -Mb genome of B. henselae. Control hybridizations of labeled DNA from the human pathogen Bartonella quintana with a reduced genome of 1. 58 Mb were performed to evaluate the accuracy of the array for genes with known levels of sequence divergence. Genome size estimates of B. koehlerae by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis matched that calculated by the CGH, indicating a genome of 1. 7 to 1. 8 Mb with few unique genes. As in B. quintana, sequences in the prophage and the genomic islands were reported absent in B. koehlerae. In addition, sequence variability was recorded in the chromosome II-like region, where B. koehlerae showed an intermediate retention pattern of both coding and noncoding sequences. Although most of the genes missing in B. koehlerae are also absent from B. quintana, its phylogenetic placement near B. henselae suggests independent deletion events, indicating that host specificity is not solely attributed to genes in the genomic islands. Rather, the results underscore the instability of the genomic islands even within bacterial populations adapted to the same host-vector system, {{as in the case of}} B. henselae and B. koehlerae...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{only natural}} hosts of Pseudorabies virus (PRV) {{are members of}} the family Suidae (Sus scrofa scrofa). In species other than suids {{infection}} is normally fatal. In these mammals, including carnivores, PRV typically causes serious neurologic disease. The endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is a <b>wild</b> <b>feline</b> endemic to south-western Europe (Iberian Peninsula). The Iberian lynx was found to be the world 2 ̆ 019 s most endangered felid species in 2002. In <b>wild</b> <b>felines,</b> PRV infection has only been previously reported once in a Florida panther in 1994. No seropositive lynxes have ever been found, nor has PRV been detected in dead Iberian lynxes to date. Case presentation We describe the first reported case of pseudorabies in an Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus). Pseudorabies was diagnosed in a young wild Iberian lynx from Extremadura (SW Spain) by histopathological examination, immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis. Gross lesions included alopecia of the ventral neck, bloody gastro-intestinal contents and congestion of the brain. Histopathological analysis showed a moderate nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis with diffuse areas of demyelination, necrotizing gastritis and enteritis of the small intestine. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) antigen was found in neuronal and non-neuronal cells of the brain, tonsils, and gastric glandular epithelial cells by immunohistochemical analysis. The presence of the virus in the brain was confirmed by nested PCR.

6000|$|The {{increased}} or diminished {{length of}} the intestines, which apparently results from changed diet, is a more remarkable case, because it is characteristic of certain animals in their domesticated condition, and therefore must be inherited. The complex absorbent system, the blood-vessels, nerves, and muscles, are necessarily all modified together with the intestines. According to Daubenton, the intestines of the domestic cat are one-third longer than those <b>of</b> the <b>wild</b> cat <b>of</b> Europe; and although this species is not the parent- stock of the domestic animal, yet, as Isidore Geoffroy has remarked, the several species of cats are so closely allied that the comparison is probably a fair one. The increased length appears {{to be due to}} the domestic cat being less strictly carnivorous in its diet than any <b>wild</b> <b>feline</b> species; for instance, I have seen a French kitten eating vegetables as readily as meat. According to Cuvier, the intestines of the domesticated pig exceed greatly in proportionate length those <b>of</b> the <b>wild</b> boar. In the tame and wild rabbit the change is of an opposite nature, and probably results from the nutritious food given to the tame rabbit. (24/33. These statements on the intestines are taken from Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 pages 427, 441.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Animals - Beyond {{living on}} a farm, Chuck is very {{friendly}} with animals. Because of this, he holds close relationships with his [...] "pets", which are typical farm animals. The most famous are his chicken, his cow, and his pig, which are called Ma Megg (Giserda), Malhada and Pork Chop (Torresmo). He also owns an unnamed dunce, a dog named Fido and several other animals which appear occasionally. There's also the Jaguar (Onça), a <b>wild</b> <b>feline</b> that is mostly a threat to Chuck and his friends, but would sometimes be treated like a friend. As a wild animal, she lives in the local jungle.|$|R
40|$|Many <b>of</b> the world's <b>wild</b> <b>feline</b> {{species are}} {{threatened}} by extinction. Gene banks are created {{with the aim of}} preserving their genetic materials. In case of unexpected death of the animals, epididymal sperm preservation can be used to avoid loss of genetic material. However, one requirement for the genetic preservation of endangered species is to preserve as much genetic material as possible. Therefore, the overall aim of this thesis is to investigate the possibility of preserving not only spermatozoa from cauda region, which is the usual site, but also from other regions of the epididymis. If these spermatozoa could be used in assisted reproductive technology such as in vitro fertilization in the future, the number of the spermatozoa that could be preserved from one individual will be increased. The ability of feline spermatozoa from caput, corpus and cauda regions of epididymis to undergo capacitation and acrosome reaction, which are required before spermatozoa are able to fertilize oocytes, were investigated. We found that epididymal spermatozoa from all regions are able to undergo capacitation and acrosome reaction in vitro. However, the majority of the spermatozoa from corpus and cauda are more mature than the caput spermatozoa. Therefore spermatozoa from corpus and cauda regions were cryopreserved. After thawing, spermatozoa from corpus and cauda epididymal regions showed a similar survival rate and the cryopreservation process did not affect the DNA stability of these spermatozoa. Three different techniques, sperm chromatin structure assay, acridine orange staining technique and sperm chromatin dispersion, were compared and DNA stability of spermatozoa from the corpus and cauda epididymis after freezing-thawing was evaluated. All these techniques can be used to evaluate DNA fragmentation of feline epididymal spermatozoa but give different DNA fragmentation index values. Frozen-thawed feline epididymal spermatozoa from both the corpus and cauda were able to fertilize homologous oocytes in vitro and the embryos could develop to blastocyst stage. In conclusion, this thesis reveals that feline epididymal spermatozoa from the corpus region have a similar capability as spermatozoa from the cauda in many respects. Preservation of spermatozoa from corpus together with cauda can increase the number of spermatozoa that we can preserve from one individual by approximately 40...|$|R
40|$|Cryopreservation of gametes is an {{important}} tool in assisted reproduction programmes; long-term storage of oocytes or spermatozoa is necessary when in vitro fertilization (IVF) or artificial insemination is to be performed at a future date. Cryopreservation of epididymal spermatozoa offers a potential tool for rescuing genetic material from males of endangered populations. The objectives of this work were to: (1) examine sperm motility, viability, abnormality and acrosome integrity of frozen–thawed domestic cat epididymal spermatozoa; and (2) evaluate the same cryopreservationmethod onwild feline spermatozoa, needed to preserve their genetic resources. Epididymides were collected from 20 domestic cats during routine neutering procedure and from two <b>wild</b> <b>felines</b> at autopsy. The sperm samples, diluted with 4...|$|R
