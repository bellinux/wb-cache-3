5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> the road. Thereafter he {{frequently}} walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E
5|$|In 1556, amid great pomp, {{and leaning}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> {{one of his}} {{favorites}} (the 24-year-old William, Count of Nassau and Orange), Charles gave away his lands and his offices. The Spanish empire, which included Spain, the Netherlands, Naples, Milan and Spain's possessions in the Americas, went to his son, Philip. His brother, Ferdinand, who had negotiated the treaty in the previous year, was already in possession of the Austrian lands and was also the obvious candidate to succeed Charles as Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Ostrom {{published}} another monograph <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> Deinonychus {{in which}} {{he realized that the}} pubis that he had described was actually a coracoid– a shoulder element. In that same year, another specimen of Deinonychus, MCZ 4371, was discovered and excavated in Montana by Steven Orzack during a Harvard University expedition headed by Farish Jenkins. This discovery added several new elements: well preserved femurs, pubes, a sacrum, and better ilia, as well as elements of the pes and metatarsus. Ostrom described this specimen and revised his skeletal restoration of Deinonychus. This time it showed the very long pubis, and Ostrom began to suspect that they may have even been a little retroverted like those of birds.|$|E

5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} appears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> the dying Cú Chulainn, and {{could also be}} a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is {{associated}} with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E
5|$|Oasis {{signed to}} {{independent}} record label Creation Records in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe (1994). The following year the band recorded (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995) with drummer Alan White, {{in the midst}} of a chart rivalry with Britpop peers Blur. Along with Suede, Pulp, Blur and others, Oasis came to be regarded as one of the major bands of the Britpop movement and the Gallagher brothers were featured regularly in tabloid newspapers for their sibling disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1997 Oasis released their third album, Be Here Now (1997), and although it was the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, the album's popularity tapered off quickly, but not before selling 8 million copies. McGuigan and Arthurs left Oasis in 1999 as the band released Standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shoulder</b> <b>of</b> Giants (2000). After their departures, they were replaced by former Heavy Stereo guitarist/frontman Gem Archer and former Ride guitarist/frontman Andy Bell. Their fifth studio album Heathen Chemistry was released in 2002. In 2004 drummer Alan White left the band leaving them as a four-piece with addition of the Who drummer Zak Starkey as recording and touring unofficial fifth member and found renewed success and popularity with Don't Believe the Truth (2005).|$|E

25|$|Truck drivers often {{spend their}} nights parked at a truck stop, rest area, or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> a freeway ramp. Sometimes these are in secluded areas or {{dangerous}} neighborhoods, {{which account for}} a number of deaths due to drivers being targeted by thieves for their valuable cargo, money, and property, or for the truck and trailer themselves. Drivers of trucks towing flatbed trailers are responsible for securing and strapping down their cargo (which often involves climbing onto the cargo itself), and if the load requires tarping necessitates climbing on the load to spread out tarps. Tarps can weigh up to 200lbs each and the cargo can require up to 3 tarps per load which account {{for a number of}} deaths and injuries from falling. Drivers spend long hours behind the wheel, which can cause strain on the back muscles. Some drivers are responsible for unloading their cargo, which can lead to many back strains and sprains due to overexertion and improper lifting techniques. If the cab of the truck is not appropriate for the driver's size, the driver can lose visibility and easy access to the controls and be at higher risk for accidents.|$|E
25|$|The Hungarian {{plan of the}} Spring Campaign, {{elaborated}} by Antal Vetter, {{was that}} the 7th corps, under the lead of András Gáspár, had {{to attract the attention}} of Windisch-Grätz on his troops by making and attack from the direction of Hatvan, while the other three corps (I., II., III.) would encircle the Austrian forces from South West, and cut them from the capital cities (Pest and Buda). According to the plan, the 7th corps had to stay at Hatvan until 5 April, than on 6th it had to reach Bag. The attack on the Austrian forces had to occur on 7 April at Gödöllő, from two directions, while the I. corps would advance to Kerepes, and fell on the Austrians from behind, preventing them to retreat towards Pest. The key of this very risky plan was that the Austrians would not discover the Hungarian movements until they completed the encirclement. This is why <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> the Hungarian commander of the VIIth Corps, András Gáspár, lied a very big responsibility to lead his troops in a way which will not betray the campaigns strategy. This meant that he had to make the enemy commander who faced him, to think that he is face to face with the whole Hungarian army, distracting his attention about the I., II., and III. Hungarian corps, which in the meanwhile, were advancing towards Gödöllő from South-East. If Gáspár would have failed this task, Windsich-Grätz could been sent huge troops to destroy him, which would have been open before them the way to the interim Hungarian capital, Debrecen.|$|E
