25|$|The {{vastness of}} the North American continent, and the variety of its climates, ecology, vegetation, fauna, and landforms, led ancient peoples to {{coalesce}} into many distinct linguistic and cultural groups. This {{is reflected in the}} oral histories of the indigenous peoples, described by a wide range of traditional creation stories which <b>often</b> <b>say</b> that a given people has been living in a certain territory since the creation of the world.|$|E

2500|$|The Talmud <b>often</b> <b>says</b> of {{the interpretations}} of a baraita: [...] "The Biblical passage should be merely a support." [...] Of this class {{are many of}} the {{explanations}} in the Sifra and in the Sifre. [...] The tanna also <b>often</b> <b>says</b> frankly {{that he does not}} cite the Biblical word as proof, but as a mere suggestion of the halakha, or as an allusion to it.|$|R

25|$|Critics of {{this idea}} <b>often</b> <b>say</b> this {{approach}} is overly broad in scope. However, {{it might be possible}} to constrain the fitness criterion onto a general class of results, and so obtain an evolved GP that would more efficiently produce results for sub-classes. This might take the form of a meta evolved GP for producing human walking algorithms which is then used to evolve human running, jumping, etc. The fitness criterion applied to the meta GP would simply be one of efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The {{eyes are}} often a focus of {{abduction}} claims. They are said to not move or focus in any observable way to the naked eye. Claims often describe a Grey staring {{into the eyes of}} an abductee when conducting mental procedures. This staring is claimed to induce hallucinogenic states or directly provoke different emotions. Although abduction claimants <b>often</b> <b>say</b> that the Grey was only inches from their face during the staring mindscan procedure, they often subsequently claim to not feeling breath or seeing the Grey's chest move from breathing.|$|E
25|$|People <b>often</b> <b>say</b> that {{machines}} enslave man {{and that}} technology dehumanises society, {{but they are}} wrong! It is the manufacturer that enslaves man. It is to the manufacturer that man is condemned to a life sentence of forced labour. The manufacturer enslaves man, but robots free us. The only reason that technology is dehumanising society is because humans still {{have to work with}} the machines used for forced labour, or because they must clock in to where the forced labour takes place. That is the problem, humans and machines should not be mixed together. Humans are designed to spend their time in places of fulfilment, while machines are designed to function in the workplace, under the supervision of robots and computers.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to give even rough comparative values for money from before the 20th century, as the range of products and services available for purchase was different. Classical historians <b>often</b> <b>say</b> that in the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire (~27BC) the daily wage for an unskilled laborer and common soldier was 1 denarius (with no tax deductions) or about US$2.8 in bread. During the republic (509–27 BC), legionary pay was 112.5 denarii per year (0.3/day), later doubled by Julius Caesar to 225 denarii (0.6/day), with soldiers having {{to pay for their}} own food and arms. Centurions received considerably higher pay; under Augustus, the lowest rank of centurion was paid 3,750 denarii and the highest rank, 15,000 denarii.|$|E
25|$|Developing {{a sexual}} {{self-concept}} {{is an important}} developmental step during adolescence. This is when adolescents {{try to make sense}} and organize their sexual experiences so that they understand the structures and underlying motivations for their sexual behavior. This sexual self-concept helps adolescents organize their past experiences, but also gives them information to draw on for their current and future sexual thoughts and experiences. Sexual self-concept affects sexual behavior for both men and women, but it also affects relationship development for women. Development of one’s sexual self-concept can occur even before sexual experiences begin. An important part of sexual self-concept is sexual esteem, which includes how one evaluates their sexuality (including their thoughts, emotions and sexual activities). Another aspect is sexual anxiety; this includes one’s negative evaluations of sex and sexuality. Sexual self-concept is not only developed from sexual experiences; both girls and boys can learn from a variety of social interactions such as their family, sexual education programs, depictions in the media and from their friends and peers. Girls with a positive self-schema {{are more likely to be}} liberal in their attitudes about sex, are more likely to view themselves as passionate and open to sexual experience and are more likely to rate sexual experiences as positive. Their views towards relationships show that they place high importance on romance, love and intimacy. Girls who have a more negative view <b>often</b> <b>say</b> they feel self-conscious about their sexuality and view sexual encounters more negatively. The sexual self-concept of girls with more negative views are highly influenced by other people; those of girls who hold more positive views are less so.|$|E

On {{the lyric}} side of things, if I was singing about dancefloors or happier or rosier things, it wouldn't ring true for me. I don't know why that is.

500|$|Economics {{is often}} thought of as [...] "the study of how society manages its scarce resources" [...] and as such is limited to {{mathematical}} inquiry. Traditional economists <b>often</b> <b>say</b> such an approach assures objectivity and separates economics from [...] "softer" [...] fields such as sociology and political science. Feminist economists, argue on the contrary that a mathematical conception of economics limited to scarce resources is a holdover from {{the early years of}} science and Cartesian philosophy, and limits economic analysis. So feminist economists often call for more diverse data collection and broader economic models.|$|E
500|$|Auerbach {{was known}} for his love for cigar smoking. Because Red made his victory cigars a cult in the 1960s, Boston {{restaurants}} would <b>often</b> <b>say</b> [...] "no cigar or pipe smoking, except for Red Auerbach". In addition, Auerbach was well known for his love of Chinese food. In an interview shortly before his death, he explained that since the 1950s, Chinese takeout was the most convenient nutrition: back then, NBA teams travelled on regular flights and had a tight time schedule, so filling up the stomach with heavier non-Chinese food meant wasting time and risking travel-sickness. Over the years, Auerbach became so fond of this food that he even became a part-owner of a Chinese restaurant in Boston. Despite a heart operation, he remained active in his 80s, playing racquetball and making frequent public appearances.|$|E

[...] His anti-racist sister Kayla, who is two years younger than Paul, often argued with him about his racial beliefs. A few days before his arrest, a neighbor said he heard semiautomatic gunfire coming from an open field behind Schlesselman's house. After his arrest, Schlesselman's family expressed doubt that he seriously intended {{to carry out the}} plot; his father, Mike, said, [...] "I think it's just a lot of talk.

What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
500|$|Fermi {{decided to}} travel abroad, {{and spent a}} {{semester}} studying under Max Born at the University of Göttingen, where he met Werner Heisenberg and Pascual Jordan. Fermi then studied in Leiden with Paul Ehrenfest from September to December 1924 on a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation obtained through the intercession of the mathematician Vito Volterra. Here Fermi met Hendrik Lorentz and Albert Einstein, and became good friends with Samuel Goudsmit and Jan Tinbergen. [...] From January 1925 to late 1926, Fermi taught mathematical physics and theoretical mechanics at the University of Florence, where he teamed up with Rasetti to conduct a series of experiments {{on the effects of}} magnetic fields on mercury vapour. He also participated in seminars at the Sapienza University of Rome, giving lectures on quantum mechanics and solid state physics.
