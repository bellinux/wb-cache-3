5|$|Inside {{the living}} hut were two small ante-rooms, one {{used as a}} {{photographic}} darkroom, the other for taxidermy. Within the main accommodation area daylight was admitted via a double-glazed and shuttered window and through a small square pane high on the northern wall. Bunks were fitted around the outer walls, and a table and stove dominated the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hut.</b> During the few brief weeks before winter set in, members of the party made trial sledging journeys on the sea ice in nearby Robertson Bay, during which they surveyed the coastline and collected specimens of birds and fish. They also slaughtered seals and penguins for food and fuel. Outside activities were largely curtailed in Mid-May, {{with the onset of}} severe winter weather.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the entire}} party, none were skilled skiers and only Bernacchi and Armitage had any {{experience}} with dog-sledges. The {{results of the}} men's early efforts to master these techniques were not encouraging, and tended to reinforce Scott's preference for man-hauling. The dangers of the unfamiliar conditions were confirmed when, on 11 March, a party returning from an attempted journey to Cape Crozier became stranded on an icy slope during a blizzard. In their attempts to find safer ground, one of the group, Able Seaman George Vince, slid {{over the edge of}} a cliff and was killed. His body was never recovered; a cross with a simple inscription, erected in his memory, still stands at the summit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hut</b> Point promontory.|$|E
25|$|The {{front and}} back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hut</b> are usually made of dressed stones (mostly granite). The hut has a tiny {{entrance}} at the front – about 3 feet (90cm) wide, 3 feet (90cm) tall, through which people must crawl to enter the interior. This unusually small entrance {{is a means of}} protection from wild animals. The front portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hut</b> is decorated with the Toda art forms, a kind of rock mural painting.|$|E
2500|$|Four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>huts</b> (3, 7, 17 and 18) contain raised or upright stones, {{described}} as [...] "anvil" [...] stones, <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> which is unknown.|$|R
2500|$|At [...] {{above sea}} level, it is <b>the</b> second highest <b>hut</b> in <b>the</b> chain, and it sleeps the third highest number <b>of</b> guests. <b>The</b> <b>hut</b> is {{accessed}} most {{directly from the}} Valley Way trail (from the Appalachia parking lot). It is generally considered <b>the</b> most difficult <b>of</b> <b>the</b> full-service <b>huts</b> to access, based on distance and elevation required to reach it. To the southwest is Lakes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clouds <b>Hut,</b> and to <b>the</b> southeast is Carter Notch Hut.|$|R
40|$|Differences between {{individual}} human houses can confound results of studies aimed at evaluating indoor vector control interventions such as insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual insecticide spraying (IRS). Specially designed and standardised experimental huts have historically provided {{a solution to}} this challenge, with an added advantage that they can be fitted with special interception traps to sample entering or exiting mosquitoes. However, many of these experimental hut designs have a number of limitations, for example: 1) inability to sample mosquitoes on all sides of huts, 2) increased likelihood of live mosquitoes flying out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>huts,</b> leaving mainly dead ones, 3) difficulties <b>of</b> cleaning <b>the</b> <b>huts</b> when a new insecticide is to be tested, and 4) the generally small size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experimental <b>huts,</b> which can misrepresent actual local house sizes or airflow dynamics in the local houses. Here, we describe a modified experimental <b>hut</b> design - <b>The</b> Ifakara Experimental Huts- and explain how these huts can be used to more realistically monitor behavioural and physiological responses of wild, free-flying disease-transmitting mosquitoes, including the African malaria vectors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species complexes Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus, to indoor vector control-technologies including ITNs and IRS. Important characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ifakara experimental <b>huts</b> include: 1) interception traps fitted onto eave spaces and windows, 2) use of eave baffles (panels that direct mosquito movement) to control exit of live mosquitoes through the eave spaces, 3) use of replaceable wall panels and ceilings, which allow safe insecticide disposal and reuse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>huts</b> to test different insecticides in successive periods, 4) <b>the</b> kit format <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>huts</b> allowing portability and 5) an improved suite of entomological procedures to maximise data quality...|$|R
25|$|We {{were about}} to sit down to tea when Mdlle. Gronin called our {{attention}} to the steady light, round, and {{about the size of a}} cheese plate, which appeared suddenly on the wall of the little garden directly opposite the door <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hut</b> in which we sat.|$|E
25|$|After the {{remainder}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hut</b> Point party had crossed to Cape Evans in mid-July {{a series of}} searches instituted by Joyce failed to establish the fate of Mackintosh and Hayward. Further searches took place when Aurora finally returned to relieve the party, in January 1917. A memorial cross was erected to Mackintosh and Hayward at Wind Vane Hill, a weather observation post near Cape Evans.|$|E
25|$|The hearth was {{variously}} {{located at}} the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hut,</b> or opposite the door. Ash from the hearths {{was found to be}} from oak and willow twigs. A lack of log remains and the presence of peat ash shows that by the time of Grimspound's occupation, the local forests had been replaced by enough peat buildup for it to be cut for fuel. Cooking holes contained granite pot boilers, pieces of stone heated in the fire and dropped into pots of water sunk into the ground (the pottery of the time not being fireproof).|$|E
25|$|In rural areas, {{people often}} live in wooden huts with {{corrugated}} iron roofs. Outhouses {{are located in}} back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>huts.</b> In Port-au-Prince, colorful shantytowns surround the central city and go up the mountainsides.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hut</b> Point and Cape Evans huts remain, {{protected}} by the Antarctic Heritage Trust and the New Zealand government. Within <b>the</b> Cape Evans <b>hut</b> an inscription by Richards on the wall near his bunk, listing <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> those lost, can still be read, but the generally deteriorating condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>huts</b> has caused concern.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> {{movement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>huts</b> {{was completed}} in May 1905. This move created Gaudaloupe and Martinique barracks on <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> A325, enabling <b>the</b> four barracks <b>of</b> Bordon to house a complete infantry brigade.|$|R
25|$|New arrivals {{normally}} receive {{one piece}} of reinforced plastic 4 by 5 meters with which to construct their shelter. The plastic, while providing an excellent waterproof layer, is not self-supporting, nor does it provide any insulation. They need long supple pieces of wood to make the frame and grass to complete the shelter walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hut</b> and provide some thermal insulation. Housing is built of mud brick, wood, or cane extracted from the surrounding territories and new or scavenged canvas. The other half is thatched roof huts, tents, and mud abodes.|$|E
25|$|In February 1940, Alexander {{arrived at}} Bletchley Park, the British code{{breaking}} centre during the Second World War. He joined Hut 6, the section tasked with breaking German Army and Air Force Enigma messages. In 1941, {{he transferred to}} Hut 8, the corresponding hut working on Naval Enigma. He became deputy head of Hut 8 under Alan Turing. Alexander was more involved with the day-to-day operations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hut</b> than Turing, and, while Turing was visiting the United States, Alexander formally became the head of Hut 8 around November 1942. Other senior colleagues included Stuart Milner-Barry, Gordon Welchman, and Harry Golombek. In October 1944, Alexander was transferred {{to work on the}} Japanese JN-25 code.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} day, on the Sunday, Beattie's {{group had}} great difficulty getting out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hut</b> {{because of the}} deep snow and in arduous conditions they were scarcely able to descend from the plateau. At 16:30 they reached Rothiemurchus Hut where {{they were able to}} telephone Lagganlia and they met their transport vehicle at 17:30. The children were returned to Lagganlia while Beattie and Paisley drove to the ski centre where they were unable to learn any news. They then went to Glenmore Lodge and then Aviemore police station where at 19:00 they reported Davidson's party missing. Three pairs of rescuers were immediately dispatched from Glenmore Lodge into the blizzard and the night and the Cairngorm, RAF Kinloss, Braemar and Aberdeen MRTs were called out. The mountain rescue teams made their preparations so they could start off hours before first light on Monday.|$|E
50|$|Five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>huts</b> are serviced, i.e. {{firewood}} or coal is provided, and 14 to 20 bunks are available: Cannibal Gorge, Ada Pass, Christopher, Anne and Boyle Flat huts. Christopher Cullers and Rokeby huts {{are basic}} huts with four and three bunks, respectively.|$|R
50|$|During the First World War, {{there was}} a Royal Flying Corps {{airfield}} near to Drome Road. In 1919, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>huts</b> from <b>the</b> aerodrome was bought by Yearsley Bridge Hospital (a fever hospital), in <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> York, to provide additional nurses's accommodation.|$|R
25|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>huts</b> {{were located}} at Bordon, the 23rd Field Company Royal Engineers placed <b>the</b> <b>huts.</b> <b>The</b> {{movement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>huts</b> {{was completed in}} May 1905. There {{were a number of}} notable accidents. In June 1903, a sapper was crushed to death underneath a <b>hut,</b> while <b>the</b> team attempted a hoist in the rain. A second hut slipped off of its railway trolleys at Whitehill, and was abandoned. It was later converted into the local police station.|$|R
25|$|The Ross Sea {{party was}} a {{component}} of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–17. Five men were stranded not far away from Cape Evans. There was sea ice {{between them and the}} relative safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hut</b> on Cape Evans. On 8 May two of the men, Aeneas Mackintosh and Victor Hayward, decided to make an attempt to reach the hut. Soon after they set out a blizzard hit. When the weather cleared up, the remaining men tried to look for them, but realized that the ice was far too thin to cross, and that their friends had been lost. Now they knew that they should wait for a thicker ice and for the full moon to attempt the crossing. Having the full moon was essential, because during polar night the Moon is the only source of natural light other than the extremely dim light of the stars.|$|E
25|$|Hayward quickly {{proved himself}} to be {{hard-working}} and resourceful. He {{was one of the}} ten members of the shore party that was marooned when the Ross Sea party’s expedition ship Aurora broke from its McMurdo Sound moorings during a storm and was unable to return. In difficult circumstances he played a full part in the efforts of the stranded group to fulfil its mission, despite its shortages of food, proper clothing, and equipment. During the main depot-laying journey on the Great Ice Barrier in 191516 Hayward was one of the six who marched to the Beardmore Glacier to lay the last of the required chain of depots. On the return leg the party was struck with scurvy, which caused the death of Arnold Spencer-Smith. Although suffering badly himself, Hayward helped bring the rest of the party off the Barrier to the relative safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hut</b> Point shelter.|$|E
500|$|The expedition's hut, a {{prefabricated}} structure measuring 33 x 19feet (10m x 5.8m), {{was ready}} for occupation {{by the end of}} February. It was divided into a series of mainly two-person cubicles, with a kitchen area, a darkroom, storage and laboratory space. The ponies were housed in stalls built on the most sheltered side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hut,</b> while the dog kennels were placed close to the porch. Shackleton's inclusive leadership style, in contrast to that of Scott, meant no demarcation between upper and lower decks—all lived, worked and ate together. Morale was high; as assistant geologist Philip Brocklehurst recorded, Shackleton [...] "had a faculty for treating each member of the expedition as though he were valuable to it".|$|E
50|$|A typical housing {{collective}} in Boumdoudoum {{consists of}} several round houses of clay with thatched roofs. The houses are connected with clay walls or straw mats and enclose an inner courtyard. In the courtyard {{there is a}} small house. In <b>the</b> <b>huts,</b> family members sleep on the floor in groups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sex and social hierarchy. Belongings are stored on <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>huts</b> or hung on a cord.|$|R
50|$|A short {{distance}} from the exhibition area, lake, lakeside and land dwellings have been built by the lake, all exact reconstructions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>huts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prehistoric settlement. Inside <b>the</b> <b>huts</b> are all <b>the</b> utensils which the people used for their everyday needs. An earthen cover in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> settlement served to protect the fire, {{and there is a}} kind of pirogue moored at the lakeside, which the inhabitants would have used for fishing.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>huts</b> {{range from}} very basic (Liki North) {{with little more}} than a roof, to luxurious with log fires and running water (Meru Mt Kenya Lodge). Most huts have no heat or light, but are spacious with dormitories and {{communal}} areas. They also offer separate accommodation for porters and guides. <b>The</b> communal areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>huts</b> can be used by campers wishing to retreat from the weather or to store food away from the hyaena and hyraxes.|$|R
500|$|With {{the help}} of fresh seal meat which halted the ravages of scurvy, the {{survivors}} slowly recovered at Hut Point. The unstable condition of the sea ice in McMurdo Sound prevented them from completing the journey to the Cape Evans base. Conditions at Hut Point were gloomy and depressing, with an unrelieved diet and no normal comforts; Mackintosh in particular found the squalor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hut</b> intolerable, and dreaded the possibility that, caught at Hut Point, they might miss {{the return of the}} ship. On 8 May 1916, after carrying out reconnaissance {{on the state of the}} sea ice, Mackintosh announced that he and Hayward were prepared to risk the walk to Cape Evans. Against the urgent advice of their comrades, they set off, carrying only light supplies.|$|E
500|$|On 27 October 1912, Mawson {{outlined}} the summer sledging program. Seven sledging parties would depart from Cape Denison, surveying {{the coast and}} interior of Adélie Land and neighbouring King George V Land. They were required {{to return to the}} base by 15 January, when the Aurora was due to depart; any later, it was feared, and she would be trapped by ice. Bickerton was to lead one of the parties, which would use the air-tractor to haul four sledges and explore the coast to the west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hut.</b> Most of the parties left in early November, but Bickerton's Western party delayed until December, in the hope of avoiding the ferocious winter winds. Work on the air-tractor sledge was delayed by the fierce winds, and the first trial took place on 15 November, between the main base and Aladdin's Cave—a depot which had been established on the plateau above Cape Denison. The air-tractor reached a speed of , covering the , expedition member Charles Laseron recorded, [...] "in great style". Soon, the sledge began hauling cargo up the slope, laying depots for the summer sledging parties.|$|E
500|$|The {{inclusion}} of the Bautista bat flip celebration, which could be viewed during the beta, received wide media coverage, with sites such as Yahoo! Sports, FOX Sports, CBS Sports, {{as well as the}} MLB's own Cut4 news subsidiary reporting on it. Critics who played the game's beta gave it generally positive reviews. Samit Sarkar of Polygon stated that [...] "NHL 17 is shaping up {{to be the kind of}} game that could bring the series back to its previous-generation heights," [...] complimenting the game's gameplay improvements and the new additions to the EASHL mode. Jake Sundstrom of SB Nations Fear the Fin blog enjoyed the game's team and arena builders, but commented that they need [...] "a little more depth". Brian Mazique of Forbes lauded the game's graphics, stating that [...] "NHL continues to be one of the most attractive sports games available." [...] He also praised the game's improved AI systems for CPU teammates and opponents as well as the online connectivity. He was more critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>HUT</b> mode's menus and the game's presentation, calling it [...] "beyond stale and outdated." [...] Mazique enjoyed the EASHL mode, but felt that the player creation feature was limited in options. SB Nation writer SkyonAir, of the Stanley Cup of Chowder blog, praised the player and team creators as well as the gameplay overhaul for goaltenders. While he criticized the beta's lack of game modes offered, he recommended the game to readers.|$|E

The original hut was expanded in that same year, as well as 1911, 1922, and 1929. However, in 1940, a fire — caused by the ignition of gasoline for the gasoline-electric power generator — destroyed much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hut.</b> The following year it was rebuilt and re-opened.
