5|$|For 32 {{years there}} was no {{permanent}} memorial to the victims. Funding was obtained for a memorial in 2009, through a two-year effort by the 6th grade class of Decatur Classical School in Chicago.

5|$|In {{response}} to notification from Air Traffic Control, three ambulances from Perth were despatched {{in the direction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> site, known to be somewhere between Chidlow and York. The crash site was several miles from the road so the ambulance crews travelled eastwards {{all the way to}} York without sighting a fire. The crews were eventually guided back along the main road and then along a dirt road that enabled them to drive to within three or four miles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> site. The crews then took their first-aid boxes and set out on foot.|$|E

5|$|Toivonen, {{driving a}} Lancia Delta S4, {{died in a}} crash on 2 May 1986 while leading the Tour de Corse rally in Corsica. His American co-driver, Sergio Cresto, also died when the Lancia plunged down a ravine and exploded. The fatal crash had no close {{witnesses}} and the only remains of the car were the blackened spaceframe, {{making it impossible to}} determine the cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b> Within hours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash,</b> Jean-Marie Balestre, then President of the FISA, had banned the powerful Group B rally cars from competing the following season, ending rallying's popular supercar era.|$|E
5|$|Within days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash,</b> the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), as {{the provincial}} police for British Columbia, began an investigation. The site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> {{was under the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the RCMP detachment in Prince George, British Columbia, and any charges would be laid there. The CNR suspended all trainmen involved in passing the order to the troop train and held an internal inquiry at Kamloops. The Board of Transport Commissioners announced that a public inquiry would be held at Edmonton in December 1950.|$|E
50|$|Despite these preparations, the {{military}} operation fails, with all five helicopters crashing.

5|$|A {{temporary}} memorial {{formed from}} spontaneous tributes left by visitors {{in the days}} after the attacks at the crash site. Foundations across the country began to raise money to fund a memorial to the victims within a month <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although not {{the pilot}} in command, {{according}} to the cockpit voice recorder transcript, the first officer was the pilot flying {{at the time of}} the accident. In the National Transportation Safety Board report on the crash, investigators concluded that the likely cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> was pilot error.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} sole {{survivor of the}} flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who {{did not wish to}} tempt fate was known for never wearing his Mae West life jacket — but on this occasion, when rescued from the sea, he was wearing one. During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on amnesia. Later he explained that he must have instinctively put the vest on when he realised the plane was in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash,</b> in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the very moment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b> Kisielewski argues that the plane was likely {{under the control of the}} second pilot, who died in the crash.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> {{itself was}} not witnessed, some {{residents}} saw remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crashed</b> aircraft. At first, {{no one was}} able to get to <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> site due to poor visibility. When the rescue and recovery teams eventually reached <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> site, they found <b>the</b> bodies <b>of</b> all eighteen on board spread over the hill.|$|R

5|$|In April 1992, {{the second}} YF-22 crashed while landing at Edwards AFB. The test pilot, Tom Morgenfeld, escaped without injury. The cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> {{was found to}} be a flight control {{software}} error that failed to prevent a pilot-induced oscillation.|$|E
