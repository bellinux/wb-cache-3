May also result if we are witness to situations that happen in the course of <b>our</b> <b>work</b> (e.g. violence in the workplace, reviewing violent video tapes, etc). Risk increases with exposure and with the absence of seeking protective factors and pre-preparation of preventive strategies.|$|E
