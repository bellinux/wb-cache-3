Hinde that he had visited the region in order that the people might see and know their superintendent; remarking, [...] "The {{shepherd}} ought to know the flock, and the flock the shepherd: they ought to know what man it is that governs them, and I have come nearly one hundred miles <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> see them." [...] The writer exclaims, [...] "O Asbury, the inhabitants of these hills and mountains will long make mention of thee!" ...|$|E
500|$|Reservoir Dogs was, {{according}} to Tarantino, influenced by Stanley Kubrick's The Killing. Tarantino said: [...] "I didn't go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> do a rip-off of The Killing, but I did {{think of it}} as my [...] "Killing," [...] my take on that kind of heist movie." [...] The film's plot was suggested by the 1952 film Kansas City Confidential. Additionally, Joseph H. Lewis's 1955 film The Big Combo and Sergio Corbucci's 1966 Spaghetti Western Django inspired the scene where a police officer is tortured in a chair. Tarantino has denied that he plagiarized with Reservoir Dogs and instead said that he does homages. Having the main characters named after colors (Mr. Pink, White, Brown, etc.) was first seen in the 1974 film The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. The film also contains key elements similar to those found in Ringo Lam's 1987 film City on Fire.|$|E
