5|$|Bakshi had {{selected}} {{a number of}} songs from his own record collection for the film's soundtrack, which were not used in the film due to {{the high costs of}} licensing the songs. The film was initially scored by singer Dan Hicks, who became involved with the production of the film in 1974. Because of the delay of the film's release, Hicks' label released the material from these sessions under the title It Happened <b>One</b> <b>Bite.</b> When the film was released in 1982, it had been rescored by John Madara.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to {{not like the}} taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in <b>one</b> <b>bite</b> {{whether or not the}} object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.|$|E

25|$|Documented deaths {{resulting}} from snake bites are uncommon. Nonfatal bites from venomous snakes {{may result in}} the need for amputation of a limb or part thereof. Of the roughly 725 species of venomous snakes worldwide, only 250 are able to kill a human with <b>one</b> <b>bite.</b> Australia averages only one fatal snake bite per year. In India, 250,000 snakebites are recorded in a single year, {{with as many as}} 50,000 recorded initial deaths. The WHO estimates that on the order of 100 000 people die each year as a result of snake bites, and around three times as many amputations and other permanent disabilities are caused by snakebites annually.|$|E
25|$|Large sharks {{species are}} apex predators in their environment, {{and thus have}} little fear of any {{creature}} (other than orcas) with which they cross paths. Like most sophisticated hunters, they are curious when they encounter something unusual in their territories. Lacking any limbs with sensitive digits such as hands or feet, {{the only way they}} can explore an object or organism is to bite it; these bites are known as test bites. Generally, shark bites are exploratory, and the animal will swim away after <b>one</b> <b>bite.</b> For example, exploratory bites on surfers are thought to be caused by the shark mistaking the surfer and surfboard for the shape of prey. Nonetheless, a single bite can grievously injure a human if the animal involved is a powerful predator such as a great white or tiger shark.|$|E

500|$|Time {{television}} critic James Poniewozik, {{notes that}} by the end of the first episode Frank establishes that his metaphor of choice is meat because both literally and figuratively it is his preference. He may begin a day with a celebratory rack of ribs, because [...] "I’m feelin’ hungry today!", but also he describes life with meat metaphors: he describes the White House Chief of Staff with grudging admiration: [...] "She’s as tough as a two-dollar steak."; he plans to destroy an enemy the way [...] "you devour a whale. <b>One</b> <b>bite</b> at a time."; and he endures a tedious weekly meeting with House leaders, he tells us, by [...] " [...] their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet." [...] Poniewozik notes that all of this comes from a character whose name, Underwood is a reference to the hallmark deviled ham of the William Underwood Company.|$|E
500|$|The largest known Tyrannosaurus rex skull {{measures}} up to [...] in length. Large fenestrae (openings) in {{the skull}} reduced weight and provided areas for muscle attachment, {{as in all}} carnivorous theropods. But in other respects Tyrannosauruss skull was significantly {{different from those of}} large non-tyrannosauroid theropods. It was extremely wide at the rear but had a narrow snout, allowing unusually good binocular vision. The skull bones were massive and the nasals and some other bones were fused, preventing movement between them; but many were pneumatized (contained a [...] "honeycomb" [...] of tiny air spaces) which may have made the bones more flexible as well as lighter. These and other skull-strengthening features are part of the tyrannosaurid trend towards an increasingly powerful bite, which easily surpassed that of all non-tyrannosaurids. The tip of the upper jaw was U-shaped (most non-tyrannosauroid carnivores had V-shaped upper jaws), which increased the amount of tissue and bone a tyrannosaur could rip out with <b>one</b> <b>bite,</b> although it also increased the stresses on the front teeth.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{alligator}} has a heavy {{body and a}} slow metabolism, {{it is capable of}} short bursts of speed, especially in very short lunges. Alligators' main prey are smaller animals they can kill and eat with a single bite. They may kill larger prey by grabbing it and dragging it into the water to drown. Alligators consume food that cannot be eaten in <b>one</b> <b>bite</b> by allowing it to rot, or by biting and then spinning or convulsing wildly until bite-sized chunks are torn off. This is referred to as a [...] "death roll". [...] Critical to {{the alligator}}'s ability to initiate a death roll, the tail must flex to a significant angle relative to its body. An alligator with an immobilized tail cannot perform a death roll.|$|E
2500|$|Reverend Jim Ignatowski (Christopher Lloyd) (guest star 1978, main cast 1979–1983)– A washed-up {{figure of}} the 1960s, Jim lives {{in a world of}} his own. He was once a diligent, mature student at Harvard University, with an {{extremely}} wealthy father (Victor Buono), but <b>one</b> <b>bite</b> of a drug-laden brownie was enough to get him hooked and send him into a downward spiral. (His last name had been Caldwell; he changed it to Ignatowski, thinking that the backward pronunciation of that name was [...] "Star Child".) In a particularly memorable episode, the cabbies help him pass a written exam to become one of them. He occasionally exhibits unexpected talents, such as the ability to play the piano masterfully, much to his own surprise. TV Guide placed Ignatowski 32nd on its list of the 50 greatest TV characters.|$|E
2500|$|Exploration is {{encouraged}} in the game. By exploring the game's world, players can find beds (which are save points) and routes leading {{them back to}} their safe houses. New weapons, ammunition, and scarce items can be collected by searching areas or dead bodies. These items include food and a [...] medkit (which restores health), plywood scraps (used to barricade doors), and weapon parts (which can be used in the safe house to upgrade weapons). As players discover new items during the game, previously-inaccessible areas can be entered. These items are stored in the player character's inventory (known as a bug-out-bag) or a cache in the safe house. If the player's character is killed by a zombie (which can occur with <b>one</b> <b>bite),</b> the character will permanently die and the player will then assume the role of another survivor. The previous character will become a zombie, whom the player must kill to reclaim their inventory. If Miiverse is enabled, other players' characters may also appear as zombies carrying the items they collected. A player can also place symbolic clues and hints, visible to other players, on walls. In addition to the normal-difficulty mode, ZombiU has a [...] "Chicken" [...] mode for new players and a survival mode where the game ends when the player's original character dies.|$|E

2500|$|... "Thursday night, Oct. 24, at {{a quarter}} before eight o'clock, the lovers of rat-killing enjoyed a feast of delight in a prodigious {{raticide}} at the Cockpit, Westminster. The place was crowded. The famous dog Billy, of rat-killing notoriety, 26 lb. weight, was wagered, for twenty sovereigns, to kill one hundred rats in twelve minutes. The rats were turned out loose at once in a 12-feet square, and the floor whitened, so that the rats might be visible to all. The set-to began, and Billy exerted himself to the utmost. At four minutes and three quarters, as the hero's head was covered with gore, he {{was removed from the}} pit, and his chaps being washed, he lapped some water to cool his throat. Again he entered the arena, and in vain did the unfortunate victims labour to obtain security by climbing against the sides of the pit, or by crouching beneath the hero. By twos and threes they were caught, and soon their mangled corpses proved the valour of the victor. Some of the flying enemy, more valiant than the rest, endeavoured by seizing this Quinhus Flestrum of heroic dogs by the ears, to procure a respite, or to sell their life as dearly as possible; but his grand paw soon swept off the buzzers, and consigned them to their fate. At seven minutes and a quarter, or according to another watch, for there were two umpires and two watches, at seven minutes and seventeen seconds, the victor relinquished the glorious pursuit, for all his foes lay slaughtered on the ensanguined plain. Billy was then caressed and fondled by many; the dog is estimated by amateurs as a most dextrous animal; he is, unfortunately, what the French Monsieurs call borg-ne, that is, blind of an eye.-This precious organ was lost to him some time since by the intrepidity of an inimical rat, which as he had not seized it in a proper place, turned round on its murderer, and reprived him by <b>one</b> <b>bite</b> of the privilege of seeing with two eyes in future. [...] The dog BILLY, of rat-killing notoriety, on the evening of the 13th instant, again exhibited his surprising dexterity; he was wagered to kill one hundred rats within twelve minutes; but six minutes and twenty five seconds only elapsed, when every rat lay stretched on the gory plain, without the least symptom of life appearing.' Billy was decorated with a silver collar, and a number of ribband bows, and was led off amidst the applauses of the persons assembled." ...|$|E
