5|$|In Kaga, a {{civil war}} had broken out between Togashi Masachika and Kochiyo Masachika {{for control of the}} {{position}} of shugo over the province. Kochiyo was victorious against his brother and drove him out of Kaga. When the Ōnin War began in 1467, Masachika sided with the Hosokawa clan, while Kochiyo sided with the Yamana. Kochiyo also patronized Takada school of Jōdo Shinshū, a fierce rival of the Hongan-ji school of which Rennyo was head. Masachika, seeking to reclaim his land, reached out to the Ikkō-ikki and asked for their support. In exchange, he promised to end their religious persecution and lift them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty.</b> The priests in Yoshizaki agreed to aid Masachika, and Rennyo, though alarmed by the rebellious attitude of the rebels, tacitly rendered his support as well. Asakura Toshikage, the ruler of Echizen and ally of the Hosokawa, also lent his support. Kochiyo was defeated, and Masachika restored to power.|$|E

[...] "The Government's target of lifting just 250,000 households <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fuel <b>poverty</b> over the next 10 years is tantamount to trying to bail out a sinking boat with a teacup; {{in the last month}} alone another 300,000 households have joined the ranks of the fuel poor," [...] she pointed out.|$|R
5|$|In September 1919, Quisling {{departed}} Norway {{to become}} an intelligence officer with the Norwegian delegation in Helsinki, a post that combined diplomacy and politics. In the autumn of 1921, Quisling left Norway once again, this time {{at the request of}} explorer and humanitarian Fridtjof Nansen, and in January 1922 arrived in the Ukrainian capital Kharkov to help with the League of Nations humanitarian relief effort there. Highlighting the massive mismanagement of the area and the death toll of approximately ten thousand a day, Quisling produced a report that attracted aid and demonstrated his administrative skills, as well as his dogged determination to get what he wanted. On 21August, he married the Russian Alexandra Andreevna ("Asja") Voronina, the daughter of a peddler. Alexandra wrote in her memoirs that Quisling declared his love for her, but based on his letters home and investigations undertaken by his cousins, it appears that there was never any question of romantic involvement between the two. Quisling merely seemed to have wanted to lift the girl <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> by providing her with a Norwegian passport and financial security.|$|E

40|$|Many social programs, {{and most}} poverty–fighting programs, {{are based on}} the {{assumption}} that increasing income automatically translates into a raise in well–being. This investigation questions this assumption on the basis of the subjective well–being literature and on empirical analyses from Mexico. It is shown that it is possible to get people <b>out</b> <b>of</b> income <b>poverty</b> without necessarily increasing their well–being. The paper enunciates some general principles that can enhance social programs. It is argued that it is fine to be concerned about getting people <b>out</b> <b>of</b> income <b>poverty,</b> but it is even better to be concerned about placing them in a situation that favors their satisfaction with life. </span...|$|R

This study reviews scholarly literature and federal policy, as well as adds new interviews focused on a case study of Mecca and Thermal, two small, unincorporated communities in California’s Eastern Coachella Valley (ECV). Through these techniques I found that rural poverty is characterized by a unique invisibility and that although there are certain pathways <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this <b>poverty,</b> these pathways are unlikely, temporary, and too insubstantial to make significant change...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} be {{successful}} at improving household’s financial self‐sufficiency and stability, asset‐building policies must be designed to prevent households from falling back into asset poverty once they exit it. This paper uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data from 1994 to 2007 to analyze the influence of life events, demographics and financial behaviors on the duration <b>out</b> <b>of</b> asset <b>poverty.</b> We find evidence that suggests there are structural barriers to asset acquisition. Asset accumulation at levels equal to nine months worth of income at the income poverty level or greater is important for improving a family’s odds of permanently escaping asset poverty. Additionally, minimizing debt and diversifying the asset portfolio to include more productive assets are important for maintaining assets. This paper provides some insights on policies to help individuals more successfully transition <b>out</b> <b>of</b> asset <b>poverty...</b>|$|R
