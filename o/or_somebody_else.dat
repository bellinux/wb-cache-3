5|$|As {{a form of}} express trust, {{charitable}} trusts {{are subject}} to certain formalities, {{as well as the}} requirements of the three certainties, when being created. These vary depending on whether the gift that creates the trust is given in life, given after death, or includes land. If the gift is given after death through a will, the will must comply with Section 9 of the Wills Act 1837, which requires that the will be in writing and signed by the testator (<b>or</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> present, at the testator's instruction), {{it is clear that the}} testator intended to give effect to the will, and the signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses. If these are all carried out, the will is a valid document, and the gift made as part of it can create a charitable trust. If the gift is of land and made during the donor's lifetime, it must comply with Section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, which requires that the agreement be a written document signed by the person giving it. If the gift is of personal property and made inter vivos, there are no formal requirements; it is enough that an oral declaration is made creating the trust. Once constituted properly, a charitable trust, like all express trusts, cannot be undone unless there is something allowing that within the trust instrument.|$|E
2500|$|On December 3, 2008, Cincinnati-based NBC {{affiliate}} WLWT asked Huckabee {{about the}} prospect of running, to which he said, [...] "I'm pretty sure I'll be out there.

2500|$|Child-safety {{advocate}} Marc Klaas {{has come}} out publicly in support of Perverted-Justice and the work they do, suggesting that they go {{from city to city}} with their efforts. [...] "I think if you were to take this 'Dateline' piece {{and turn it into a}} regular program, where Perverted-Justice and Chris Hansen <b>or</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> were to go from city to city to city on a weekly basis, you would create a real deterrent effect that would put some fear into the minds of these perverts." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the novel, King George VI, the British Royal Family and Prime Minister Winston Churchill flee {{into exile}} in Canada. Edward VIII regained the British throne soon afterwards, with Wallis Simpson as his queen. The US {{defeated}} Japan in 1945 using nuclear weapons. Germany tested its first atomic bomb in 1946 and fired a non-nuclear [...] "V-3" [...] missile above New York City to demonstrate {{an ability to}} attack the continental United States with long-range missiles. Thus, after a peace treaty in 1946, the US and Germany are the two superpower opponents in the Cold War of this world. There is {{a reference to a}} brutal regime having power in China, but no reference to its ideology and whether it is headed by Mao <b>or</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Mohamed ElBaradei was {{reportedly}} appointed prime minister by acting President Mansour, {{over the objections}} of Islamists. The announcement of ElBaradei's appointment was later retracted, with a spokesman for the president saying no decision had been made on whether ElBaradei <b>or</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> would be named prime minister. Ahmed Douma, a dissident jailed for [...] "insulting" [...] President Morsi and inciting violence against the Muslim Brotherhood during protests earlier in the year, was released from custody pending a court verdict. Meanwhile, clashes continued on the Sinai Peninsula, with a Coptic Christian priest shot to death by masked gunmen. Pro-Morsi supporters continued their sit-in in front of the Rabia Al-Adawiya Mosque in Nasr City, a suburb of Cairo, demanding the reinstatement of the former president.|$|E

50|$|The {{author of}} Uc's vida (biography), whose {{reliability}} {{is difficult to}} ascertain, states that Uc was a cleric well-versed in letters with a natural wit.

5000|$|Ubi panis ibi patria is a Latin {{expression}} meaning [...] "Where {{there is}} bread, there is (my) country" [...] (or home, or homeland). According to J.

I felt very doubtful, in my own mind, as to whether the train knew where it was going at all.|$|R
