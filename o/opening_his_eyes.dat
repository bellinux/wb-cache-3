It is this latter job that Reid quotes as <b>opening</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> politically. He was assigned to the tenements in the East End of Glasgow after the city was hit by storms in late-1968 and saw poverty of a kind he did not know existed: a sick infant sleeping in a wooden box, in a damp-ridden room, a distracted old woman buying coal for a tenement flat that had no coal fire. Soon after this experience, he joined the Labour Party.|$|E

After Balor's death the Fomorians were defeated and driven into the sea.|$|R

60|$|He turned Tom {{over and}} then ran for some water. When he {{returned}} Tom was just <b>opening</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Seating {{himself at}} a reading-table before the fire, {{he took up}} the book nearest <b>his</b> hand, absently <b>opening</b> it. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> fell upon this sentence: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{mean the}} post of keeper of the Asiatic manuscripts," [...] he said, <b>opening</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> with childlike wonder. [...] "Oh, yes, I got that. But the real {{objection}} to your argument, which has only, I admit, occurred to me since I {{have been out of}} the room, {{is that it does not}} merely presuppose a Zulu truth apart from the facts, but infers that the discovery of it is absolutely impeded by the facts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Harry, {{we either}} lunch or sup {{together}} every day, and I {{have been to}} the Opera with you several times," [...] said Dorian, <b>opening</b> <b>his</b> blue <b>eyes</b> in wonder.|$|R
60|$|<b>Opening</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> he saw {{crouching}} by {{his side}} about as villainous a looking tramp as one would care to meet.|$|E

6000|$|... "I do {{not even}} know him," [...] {{returned}} Low <b>opening</b> <b>his</b> clear <b>eyes</b> upon her. [...] "I've promised to hide you here, and I shall hide you as well from him as from anybody." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The devil you are!" [...] said Mowbray, <b>opening</b> wide <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> in turn; [...] "Why, Mr. A--a--your name is Touchwood--P. Touchwood--Paul, I suppose, or Peter--I read it {{so in the}} {{subscription}} book at the Well." ...|$|R
60|$|The King, who was {{standing}} by the Admiral's side, wheeled sharply {{at the sound of the}} <b>opening</b> door. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> blazed with sudden anger when he beheld his mother, but she was the first to speak.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you want}} now,--more milk?" [...] the fat boy asked, without <b>opening</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and Dan pulled him {{suddenly}} to his feet.|$|E

50|$|Gerald {{could always}} make himself look {{interesting}} at a moment's notice (...) by <b>opening</b> <b>his</b> grey <b>eyes</b> rather wide, allowing {{the corners of}} his mouth to droop, and assuming a gentle, pleading expression, resembling that of the late little Lord Fauntleroy who must, by the way, be quite old now, and an awful prig.|$|R
6000|$|... "Print!" [...] echoed François, <b>opening</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and the volume, by {{a common}} impulse, [...] "Imprimé! ha! here is papier of Mam'selle Alide, assurément." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But stop a bit!' said Mr Meagles, <b>opening</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{with a fresh}} discovery. 'Then on the mother's side, Lady Stiltstalking is {{his great}} aunt.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] asked Arthur, <b>opening</b> <b>his</b> blue <b>eyes.</b> [...] "Heaven {{intended}} that stuffy old parrot" [...] (he {{had drawn}} this learned {{man as a}} dilapidated fowl of that species) [...] "to be caricatured. Observe that his nose is already half a beak. Or perhaps it is a beak developing into a nose; it depends whether {{he is on the}} downward or upward path of evolution." ...|$|R

A new page {{in the history of}} humanity was <b>opening</b> before <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and he scanned it in wondering silence.|$|R
6000|$|Sudden calm after a storm {{followed}} the shutting of Poosk's {{mouth and the}} <b>opening</b> of <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> Another moment, {{and his father had}} him in his strong arms, turned him upside down, felt him over quietly, shook him a little, ascertained that no bones were broken, put him on his broad shoulders, and carried him straight back to the Mission Hall, where the feasters were in full swing--having apparently quite forgotten the little [...] "waif and stray." ...|$|R
