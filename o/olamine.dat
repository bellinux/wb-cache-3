40|$|The hydroxypyridone {{ciclopirox}} <b>olamine</b> {{belongs to}} the antimycotic drugs used {{for the treatment of}} superficial mycoses. In contrast to the azoles and other antimycotic drugs, its specific mode of action is only poorly understood. To investigate the mode of action of ciclopirox <b>olamine</b> on fungal viability, pathogenicity, and drug resistance, we examined the expression patterns of 47 Candida albicans genes in cells grown {{in the presence of a}} subinhibitory concentration (0. 6 μg/ml) of ciclopirox <b>olamine</b> by reverse transcription-PCR. In addition, we used suppression-subtractive hybridization to further identify genes that are up-regulated in the presence of ciclopirox <b>olamine.</b> The expression of essential genes such as ACT 1 was not significantly modified in cells exposed to ciclopirox <b>olamine.</b> Most putative and known virulence genes such as genes encoding secreted proteinases or lipases had no or only moderately reduced expression levels. In contrast, exposure of cells to ciclopirox <b>olamine</b> led to a distinct up- or down-regulation of genes encoding iron permeases or transporters (FTR 1, FTR 2, FTH 1), a copper permease (CCC 2), an iron reductase (CFL 1), and a siderophore transporter (SIT 1); these effects resembled those found under iron-limited conditions. Addition of FeCl 3 to ciclopirox olamine-treated cells reversed the effect of the drug. Addition of the iron chelator bipyridine to the growth medium induced similar patterns of expression of distinct iron-regulated genes (FTR 1, FTR 2). While serum-induced yeast-to-hyphal phase transition of C. albicans was not affected in ciclopirox olamine-treated cells in the presence of subinhibitory conditions, a dramatic increase in sensitivity to oxidative stress was noted, which may indicate the reduced activities of iron-containing gene products responsible for detoxification. Although the Candida drug resistance genes CDR 1 and CDR 2 were up-regulated, no change in resistance or increased tolerance could be observed even after an incubation period of 6 months. This was in contrast to control experiments with fluconazole, in which the MICs for cells incubated with this drug had noticeably increased after 2 months. These data support the view that the antifungal activity of ciclopirox <b>olamine</b> may at least be partially caused by iron limitation. Furthermore, neither the expression of certain multiple-drug resistance genes nor other resistance mechanisms caused C. albicans resistance to this drug even after long-term exposure...|$|E

Many solvents caused no change in the mass of nail plates, a few solvents deswelled the nail, while others swelled the nail to varying extents. Fingernail and toenail HSPs were almost the same, while hoof HSPs were similar, except for a slightly lower δP. High nail–terbinafine HCl, nail–amorolfine HCl and nail–ciclopirox <b>olamine</b> affinities, and low nail–efinaconazole affinities were then predicted, and found to accurately match experimental reports of these drugs’ affinities to keratin. We therefore propose that drug and nail Hansen Solubility Parameters may be used to predict drug–nail interactions, and that these results can assist in the design of drugs for the treatment of nail diseases, such as onychomycosis and psoriasis.

40|$|Background/Aim: Dandruff is {{a common}} scalp problem {{associated}} with flaky and inflamed skin. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a shampoo containing piroctone <b>olamine</b> and climbazole and the combination of this shampoo with a scalp tonic containing piroctone <b>olamine</b> and licochalcone A, derived from G lycyrrhiza inflata root extract, to reduce dandruff. Study Design/Methods: After conditioning, 102 subjects (♂ 56 and 46 ♀) with moderate to very strong dandruff affection underwent a randomized half head study for 4 weeks. The volunteers’ heads were washed regularly either with a placebo or the anti-dandruff shampoo, followed by the anti-dandruff tonic application or no treatment. In a 2 -week post-treatment phase, subjects only applied placebo shampoo. Every two weeks, trained experts assessed dandruff affection based {{on a scale of}} 1 to 6. At study start and after every 2 weeks, cytokine concentrations and anti-fungal activity of test products were determined in scalp wash-ups by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays or a Malassezia colony-forming assay, respectively. Results: Results of expert grading and anti-fungal activity revealed a significant reduction in dandruff affection and Malassezia colony-forming units after treatment with the anti-dandruff shampoo or its combination with the tonic. Dandruff affection even remained reduced in the post-treatment phase when levels of Malassezia colony-forming units had returned to baseline. Cytokine analyses proved a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory dandruff markers after treatment with both anti-dandruff products. For the shampoo/tonic combination, a superior reduction of one scalp inflammatory marker was determined even after the post-treatment phase. Conclusion: Both the rinse-off shampoo as well as its combination with the leave-on tonic excellently alleviated dandruff and its associated micro-inflammation. Both treatments showed anti-fungal activity. The superior benefit, exerted by the combination, is primarily based on the known anti-inflammatory effect of licochalcone A and the improved scalp substantivity of the leave-on application. </p...|$|E

OBJETIVO: Avaliar o perfil de suscetibilidade de diferentes espécies de dermatófitos, isolados de pacientes com insuficiência renal crônica, em relação a nove antifúngicos disponíveis comercialmente para o tratamento de dermatofitoses. MÉTODO: Analisaram-se 26 isolados de dermatófitos de pacientes com insuficiência renal crônica em relação a nove antifúngicos (cetoconazol, {{ciclopirox}} olamina, fluconazol, griseofulvina, itraconazol, miconazol, piroctona olamina, terbinafina e tioconazol) pelo método de microdiluição em caldo proposto pelo Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), com modificações para dermatófitos. RESULTADOS: Entre os antifúngicos testados, a terbinafina e o tioconazol obtiveram os melhores resultados de sensibilidade e o fluconazol apresentou baixa atividade, especialmente para as amostras da espécie M. gypseum. O ciclopirox olamina, apesar de menos eficaz que a terbinafina, também mostrou resultados satisfatórios. CONCLUSÕES: De modo geral, o perfil de sensibilidade dos antimicóticos testados seguiu o padrão de resultados mostrados por estudos anteriores, ratificando a necessidade de conhecimento da espécie causadora de dermatofitose, devido à variação do perfil de suscetibilidade entre as espécies. Além disso, nossos resultados demonstram a importância da realização de ensaios de sensibilidade in vitro, pois alguns isolados da mesma espécie apresentaram diferente perfil de sensibilidade BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dermatophytosis {{in the general}} population is high, particularly in patients with chronic renal failure. Treatment requires the use of topical and/or systemic antifungal drugs. The efficacy of antifungal agents for the treatment of dermatophytosis has yet to be evaluated. Studies evaluating the in vitro activity of antifungal agents are rare, particularly in filamentous fungi. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the susceptibility profile of different species of dermatophytes isolated from patients with chronic renal failure to nine antifungal drugs available on the market for the treatment of dermatophytosis. METHODS: Twenty-six isolates of dermatophytes obtained from patients with chronic renal failure were analyzed with respect to their susceptibility to nine antifungal agents (ketoconazole, ciclopirox <b>olamine,</b> fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole, miconazole, piroctone <b>olamine,</b> terbinafine and tioconazole), using the broth microdilution method proposed by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and adapted for dermatophytes.

Ciclopirox <b>olamine,</b> although less effective than terbinafine, also yielded satisfactory results. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the sensitivity profile of the antifungal agents tested in this study was similar to results obtained in previous studies, confirming the need to determine which species is causing the dermatophytosis given that antifungal susceptibility varies from one species to another.

Furthermore, CPO-induced cell death seems to be dependent on unknown protease activity but independent of the apoptotic regulators Aif 1 p and Yca 1 p and of autophagic pathways involving Apg 5 p, Apg 8 p and Uth 1 p. Our results show that CPO triggers in S. cerevisiae an atypical nonapoptotic, nonautophagic ACD with as yet unknown regulators...|$|E
40|$|Inhibitors of DNA {{replication}} in mammalian {{cells are}} {{of great interest}} because of their potential use in chemotherapy and in cell synchronizing protocols in the laboratory. We have used a combination of isotopic labelling protocols and a two-dimensional gel replicon mapping procedure to determine the specific effects of five different replication inhibitors in cultured cells. Utilizing this protocol, we show that hydroxyurea, aphidicolin, and cytosine arabinoside, three known chain elongation inhibitors, are rather ineffective at preventing fork progression even at relatively high concentrations. In contrast, two related compounds that have been suggested to be G 1 /S inhibitors (mimosine and ciclopyrox <b>olamine</b> [CPX]) actually appear to inhibit initiation at origins. One of these agents (CPX) appears also to inhibit replication in yeast, opening {{the possibility that the}} gene encoding the target (initiator?) protein can first be identified in yeast by genetic approaches and can then be used to isolate the mammalian homologue...|$|E
40|$|Superficial mycotic infections such as {{seborrheic}} dermatitis, tinea pedis, tinea corporis, and ony-chomycosis {{are common}} in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In commu-nities where HIV infections are frequent, some of these clinical presentations serve as markers of the stage of HIV infection. The diagnosis of superficial fungal infection in HIV-positive patients may be difficult because of atypical clinical manifestations. Therefore, to ensure a correct diagnosis, skin scrapings should be collected for potassium hydroxide preparations and cultures. Most forms of dermatophytosis in HIV-positive patients respond well to many topical antifungal agents, such as azoles, terbinafine, and ciclopirox <b>olamine.</b> If the disease is chronic and extensive, then ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole are each effective. Various skin conditions are associated with HIV infection. Epidemiologic {{studies have shown that}} almost all persons with HIV infection will have skin disorders at some point during their disease [1]. Dermatophytic infections {{are common in}} HIV-infected pa-tients; however, these skin diseases may not occur any mor...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of antifungal and antiseptic agents were evaluated against dermatophytes isolated from patients with tinea pedis. The antifungals studied were: ciclopirox <b>olamine,</b> cetoconazole, tolciclate and terbinafine, and the antiseptics were: povidine iodine (PVPI), propolis, Fungol®, Andriodermol®, and boric acid. The {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) or the minimal dilution concentration (MDC) was determined by an agar dilution method using modified yeast nitrogen agar base, and the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) or minimum fungicidal dilution (MFD) was determined with subcultures on Sabouraud dextrose agar. All drugs studied were active against the dermatophytes at lower concentrations than those used in products and/or pharmaceutical preparations for topical use. Some antifungal agents, mainly terbinafine and tolciclate, presented higher efficacy than the other drugs, with lower MICs and MFCs values. It was concluded {{that the use of}} these antiseptic drugs represent an excellent alternative for the topical treatment of tinea pedis. For the treatment of severe cases these are the antifungal agents of choice...|$|E
40|$|Screening {{a library}} of drugs with known safety {{profiles}} in humans yielded 30 drugs that reliably protected mammalian neurons against glucose toxicity. Subsequent screening demonstrated that 6 of these 30 drugs increase lifespan in C. elegans: caffeine, ciclopirox <b>olamine,</b> tannic acid, acetaminophen, bacitracin, and baicalein. Every drug significantly reduced the age-dependent acceleration of mortality rate. These protective effects were blocked by RNAi inhibition of cbp- 1 in adults only, which also blocks protective effects of dietary restriction. Only 2 drugs, caffeine and tannic acid, exhibited a similar dependency on DAF- 16. Caffeine, tannic acid, and bacitracin also reduced pathology in a transgenic model of proteotoxicity associated with Alzheimer’s disease. These results further support a key role for glucose toxicity in driving age-related pathologies and for CBP- 1 in protection against age-related pathologies. These results also provide novel lead compounds with known safety profiles in human for treatment of age-related diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and diabetic complications...|$|E
40|$|A {{previously}} undescribed Trichophyton {{species was}} {{isolated from the}} nail of a 33 -year-old man {{with a history of}} probable distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (without confir-mation by mycological examination). The infection occurred for the first time five years earlier (in 2006) and affected the right great toenail, with complete clinical remission after treatment with ciclopirox <b>olamine.</b> This undescribed species was isolated during probable relapse in 2011, but its etiological significance was not confirmed, that is, direct microscopy was negative and additional clinical samples were not collected. The species is probably geophilic based on phylogenetic analysis (internal transcribed spacer [ITS] rDNA) and is most closely related to the anamorphic T. thuringiense, homothallic Arthro-derma ciferrii (anamorph T. georgiae), and heterothallic A. melis. The new species is characterized by yellowish colonies, red reverse on several media, positive urease test, negative hair-perforation test, absence of growth at 34 ◦C, absence of macroconidia, for-mation of one-celled clavate microconidia, and spiral hyphae. The species grows well on sterilized human hairs placed on agar medium without any additional nutrients an...|$|E
40|$|The “in vitro ” {{antifungal}} {{activity of}} ozonized sunflower oil (Bioperoxoil®) was tested on 101 samples of yeasts originating from onychomycosis using the disk diffusion method. The oil was efficacious against several clinical fungal strains: Candida parapsilosis, Candida albicans, Trichosporon asahii, Candida tropicalis and Candida guilliermondii. Key words: ozonized sunflower oil, yeasts, antifungal activity Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of nails {{involved in an}} estimated 50 % of nail disorders (24). It is caused by several species of pathogens but in particular anthropophilic dermatophytes and yeasts (5, 8, 22). The treatment of such infections may be topical, systemic or both depending on the type, location {{and the number of}} sites (17, 19). Several drugs, including Azole compounds, Terbinafine and Ciclopirox <b>olamine</b> are particularly useful in treating onychomycosis (19, 23). Despite the availability of new systemic antifungal therapies, nail infections are difficult to eradicate and recurrence is reported in from 25 to 40 % of cases (25). Recent advances in treatment options have shown ozonized oil to be an alternative therapy against bacterial an...|$|E
