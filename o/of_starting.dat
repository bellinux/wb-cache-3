40|$|Purpose: {{optimization}} {{of highly}} skilled female biathlete preparation {{on the basis}} of creating individual competition calendars. Material and Methods: analysis of scientific-methodical literature; theoretical methods of scientific cognition; methods of mathematical statistics. Results: optimum number <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> necessary for qualitative preparation of female biathletes for the season major competition has been determined. It has been determined that in case of the season major competition to be held in February after 6 stages of the World Cup, the optimum number <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> is 13 – 15, and 27 – 30 per season (total number <b>of</b> available <b>starts</b> 34). When the season major competition is planned for March after 8 stages of the World Cup, then the average number <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> is 21 (the range from 18 to 25). Average number <b>of</b> <b>starts</b> in a season is 30 during the competitive period (the range from 24 to 34).

5|$|After The English Teacher, Narayan's {{writings}} {{took a more}} {{imaginative and}} creative external style compared to the semi-autobiographical tone of the earlier novels. His next effort, Mr. Sampath, was the first book exhibiting this modified approach. However, it still draws from {{some of his own}} experiences, particularly the aspect <b>of</b> <b>starting</b> his own journal; he also makes a marked movement away from his earlier novels by intermixing biographical events. Soon after, he published The Financial Expert, considered to be his masterpiece and hailed {{as one of the most}} original works of fiction in 1951. The inspiration for the novel was a true story about a financial genius, Margayya, related to him by his brother. The next novel, Waiting for the Mahatma, loosely based on a fictional visit to Malgudi by Mahatma Gandhi, deals with the protagonist's romantic feelings for a woman, when he attends the discourses of the visiting Mahatma. The woman, named Bharti, is a loose parody of Bharati, the personification of India and the focus of Gandhi's discourses. While the novel includes significant references to the Indian independence movement, the focus is on the life of the ordinary individual, narrated with Narayan's usual dose of irony.|$|E

5|$|As a freshman, he {{was given}} a redshirt year so he did not play during the team's 2005 {{national}} championship season. He served as the quarterback for the scout team in practice against the starting defense. During this time, Matt McCoy (no relation) was officially listed as the number three quarterback behind Vince Young and Matt Nordgren. When Brown chose to play Matt McCoy in four separate game situations where Texas had a commanding lead, confusion arose as to which McCoy was in the game. Many sportscasters mistakenly referred to Matt McCoy as Colt McCoy, as Colt was the more widely known player. The following year, with Young forgoing his senior year to enter the NFL and Nordgren graduating, the position <b>of</b> <b>starting</b> quarterback for the defending National Champion Texas Longhorns came down to a competition between redshirt freshman Colt McCoy and true freshman newcomer Jevan Snead.|$|E
