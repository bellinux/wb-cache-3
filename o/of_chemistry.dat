5|$|IUPAC and UNESCO {{were the}} lead {{organizations}} coordinating events for the International Year <b>of</b> <b>Chemistry,</b> {{which took place}} in 2011. The International Year <b>of</b> <b>Chemistry</b> was originally proposed by IUPAC at the general assembly in Turin, Italy. This motion was adopted by UNESCO at a meeting in 2008. The main objectives of the International Year <b>of</b> <b>Chemistry</b> were to increase public appreciation <b>of</b> <b>chemistry</b> and gain more interest in the world <b>of</b> <b>chemistry.</b> This event is also being held to encourage young people to get involved and contribute to chemistry. A further reason for this event being held is to honour how chemistry has made improvements to everyone's way of life.|$|E
