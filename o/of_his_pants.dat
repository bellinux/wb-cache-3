500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Love Me" [...] was {{directed}} by Alfredo Flores with Bieber as co-director. It was released on August 3, 2010. Bieber said the video serves as a [...] "tribute to his worldwide fans, thanking them for their support". The dominant scenes are made of up of live performances. Other scenes of the video feature behind-the-scenes footage such as; rehearsal sessions, fan meet and greets, making radio appearances, jokingly walking around with toilet paper sticking out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> and scenes with friends and family. Bieber's mentor, Usher, also makes an appearance in the video. The video also incorporates Bieber {{standing in front of}} a [...] "simple [...] backdrop" [...] dancing and [...] "draw hearts in the air, presumably directed at his loving fanbase" [...] relative to the songs theme, [...] "Love Me".|$|E
50|$|However, in March 1944, the German guards, always {{suspicious}} of escapes, caught the telltale sign of sand being dropped {{by one of}} the penguins out the bottom <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pant</b> legs and immediately rounded up Wally and 19 others and transferred them to another camp in Belaria.|$|R

2500|$|Besides evocations of colour, sound, {{smell and}} taste; Picasso's {{literary}} works display {{a certain amount}} of fascination with sexual and scatological behaviour.

2500|$|Viewed {{separately}} from his criminal history, the crime Gary Ewing committed {{in this case}} is relatively benign. [...] In 2000 he stole three golf clubs worth $399 each from the pro shop of the El Segundo Golf Course in El Segundo, California. [...] He slipped them down the leg <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> and a shop employee called the police when he noticed Ewing limping out of the pro shop.|$|E
2500|$|On October 1, 2015 {{a retired}} {{construction}} worker, John Bonnici, pressed charges against Fantino over an alleged incident on August 31, 1973 in which Bonnici claimed that Fantino poured ketchup down his (Bonnici's) buttocks {{and spread the}} condiment by stroking the outside <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> with a baton. Fantino, who was seeking re-election to the House of Commons in the Canadian federal election, 2015, was charged with [...] "assault with a weapon" [...] — a police baton — and [...] "assault causing bodily harm" [...] against John Bonnici. The Crown dismissed the charge in December 2015 arguing {{that there was no}} reasonable prospect of conviction.|$|E

2500|$|Mickey was {{redesigned}} by animator Fred Moore {{which was}} first seen in The Pointer (1939). Instead of having solid black eyes, Mickey was given white eyes with pupils, a Caucasian skin colored face, and a pear-shaped body. In the 40's, he changed {{once more in}} The Little Whirlwind, where he used his trademark pants {{for the last time}} in decades, lost his tail, got more realistic ears that changed with perspective and a different body anatomy. But this change would only last {{for a short period of}} time before returning to the one in [...] "The Pointer", with the exception <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants.</b> In his final theatrical cartoons in the 1950s, he was given eyebrows, which were removed in the more recent cartoons.|$|E
2500|$|As police arrived, {{the house}} lights {{were brought up}} and Brewer pointed out Oswald sitting near {{the rear of the}} theater. Police Officer Nick McDonald testified that {{he was the first to}} reach Oswald and that Oswald seemed ready to {{surrender}} saying, [...] "Well, it is all over now." [...] McDonald said that Oswald pulled out a pistol tucked into the front <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> then pointed the pistol at him, and pulled the trigger. McDonald stated that the pistol did not fire because the pistol's hammer came down on the webbing between the thumb and index finger of his hand as he grabbed for the pistol. McDonald also said that Oswald struck him, but that he struck back and Oswald was disarmed. As he was led from the theater, Oswald shouted he was a victim of police brutality.|$|E
2500|$|The tide turned with a September {{winning streak}} marked by late-inning {{comeback}} wins, {{which led to}} their most-known slogan [...] "Refuse to Lose." [...] Combined with an absolute collapse by the Angels, this {{opened the way for}} the Mariners to end up tied with the Angels for first place {{at the end of the}} regular season, forcing a one-game playoff. The playoff pitted Johnson against Angels ace Mark Langston, whom, incidentally, the Mariners had traded for Johnson in [...] Langston ended up on the seat <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> at homeplate failing to tag out Luis Sojo who came all the way around after clearing the bases with a ball that got by the Angels first baseman, J. T. Snow, rattled around underneath California's bullpen bench, and resulted in a hurried and errant cut-off throw from Langston. The Mariners won the tiebreaker game 9–1 and clinched their first-ever trip to the playoffs. The Mariners had won 25 of their last 36 games.|$|E
60|$|They {{reined in}} their horses {{just as the}} wolf rose to fly. Harry fired first, but the {{movement}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>panting</b> horse deranged <b>his</b> aim and the bullet flew wide. More accustomed to firing on horseback, Ernest's aim was truer, he struck the wolf on the shoulder, and it rolled over and over. With a shout of triumph the boys dashed forward, but when they were within a few paces the wolf leapt to its feet and endeavoured to spring towards them. Harry's horse wheeled aside so sharply that he was hurled from the saddle.|$|R
60|$|Behind him {{he could}} hear the voice of Achmet Zek crying to him to halt; but Werper only dug the spurs deeper into the {{bleeding}} sides <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>panting</b> mount. Two hundred yards within the forest a broken branch lay across the trail. It was a small thing that a horse might ordinarily take in his natural stride without noticing its presence; but Werper's horse was jaded, his feet were heavy with weariness, and as the branch caught between his front legs he stumbled, was unable to recover himself, and went down, sprawling in the trail.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a letter}} (April 6, 1960) to Donald McWhinnie at BBC Radio Drama, Beckett {{explained}} his strange text {{as the product}} of a [...] " [...] 'man' lying panting in the mud and dark murmuring his 'life' as he hears it obscurely uttered by a voice inside him... The noise <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>panting</b> fills <b>his</b> ears and it is only when this abates that he can catch and murmur forth a fragment of what is being stated within... It is in the third part that occurs the so-called voice 'quaqua', its interiorisation and murmuring forth when the panting stops. That is to say the 'I' is from the outset in the third part and the first and second, though stated as heard in the present, already over." ...|$|R
2500|$|Eugene—who {{eventually}} became completely naked, discarding even {{his shoes and}} his Bible at the crime scene—encountered 65-year-old Ronald Poppo at approximately 1:55pm. Poppo had been lying underneath the elevated Metromover people-mover viaduct when Eugene began to pummel him, strip him <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> and bite his face. The attack unfolded at {{the west end of}} the MacArthur Causeway, near the headquarters of The Miami Herald in the Omni neighborhood of Downtown Miami. It was at first believed that neither Eugene nor Poppo knew the other before their encounter, until a July 2012 publication revealed that Eugene had met Poppo while working for the homeless community of Miami. A passing cyclist, Larry Vega, came upon the scene and alerted authorities via 9-1-1. A few minutes later, Miami Police Department officer Jose Ramirez arrived and, after doing a [...] at the spectacle, warned Eugene to desist from attacking Poppo. Eugene ignored the officer's warnings and, instead, reportedly growled at him, then resumed biting his victim. The attack ended at 2:13pm with Officer Ramirez shooting Eugene once at first and then another four times when that proved ineffective. The ordeal was captured by a security camera on The Miami Herald building. Surveillance video shows that the attack continued for 18 minutes before help arrived.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shooting}} of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African American boy (June 25, 2002 – November 23, 2014), occurred on November 22, 2014, in Cleveland, Ohio. Two police officers, 26-year-old Timothy Loehmann and 46-year-old Frank Garmback, responded {{after receiving a}} police dispatch call of a black male that [...] "keeps pulling a gun out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> and pointing it at people". A caller reported that a male was pointing [...] "a pistol" [...] at random people in the Cudell Recreation Center. At {{the beginning of the}} call and again in the middle he says of the pistol [...] "it's probably fake". [...] Toward the end of the two-minute call, the caller stated [...] "he is probably a juvenile". However, this information was not relayed to Loehmann or Garmback on the initial dispatch. The officers reported that upon their arrival, they both continuously yelled [...] "show me your hands" [...] through the open patrol car window. [...] Loehmann further claimed that instead of showing his hands, it appeared as if Rice was trying to draw the replica: [...] "I knew it was a gun and I knew it was coming out". In response, the officer shot twice, hitting Rice once in the torso. He died on the following day.|$|E
60|$|Peter Rabbit led the way, {{and if he}} had run fast {{before it}} was nothing to the way he ran now. A great fear made Johnny Chuck forget that he was tired, and he ran as he had never run before in all his short life. Just as he dived head-first into a hole between two big stones, a shadow swept over the grass and {{something}} sharp tore a gap in the seat <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> and made him squeal with fright and pain. But he wriggled in beside Peter Rabbit and was safe, while Mr. Marsh Hawk flew off with a scream of rage and disappointment.|$|E

50|$|Tony tracks {{down and}} pistol-whips Coco several {{times with a}} snubnosed revolver. After curb stomping Coco's face into the stone step below the bar, {{knocking}} out his teeth, Tony leaves. At a group session with A.J.'s psychiatrist, with Tony and Carmela attending, A.J. recalls times when he felt humiliated by his mother and depressed by his visits to his grandmother Livia at her nursing-home.

6000|$|Bill was insulted at any {{suggestions}} {{as to his}} possible poor marksmanship. But this happened to be his first experience with bears in trees. He began to shoot and it took nine shots for him to dislodge the bears. Worse than that they all tumbled out of the tree--apparently unhurt. The hounds, of course, attacked them, and there arose a terrible uproar. Haught had to run down to save his dogs. Bill was going to shoot right into the melee, but Haught knocked the rifle up, and forbid him to use it. Then Bill ran into {{the thick of the}} fray to beat off the hounds. Haught became exceedingly busy himself, and finally disposed of two of the bears. Then hearing angry bawls and terrific yells he turned to see Bill climbing a tree with a big black bear tearing the seat out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants.</b> Haught disposed of this bear also. Then he said: [...] "Bill, I thought you was goin' to assassinate them." [...] Bill slid down out of the tree, very pale and disheveled. [...] "By Golly, I'll skin 'em anyhow!" ...|$|E

He is after a cariboo that isn't there. He is [...] "stalking" [...] it. With his stomach. Of course, away down in his heart {{he knows that the}} cariboo isn't there and never was; but that man read my pamphlet and went crazy. He can't help it: he's GOT to stalk something. Mark him as he crawls along; see him crawl through a thimbleberry bush (very quietly so that the cariboo won't hear the noise of the prickles going into him), then through a bee's nest, gently and slowly, so that the cariboo will not take fright when the bees are stinging him. Sheer woodcraft! Yes, mark him. Mark him any way you like. Go up behind him and paint a blue cross on the seat <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> as he crawls. He'll never notice. He thinks he's a hunting dog. Yet {{this is the man who}} laughs at his little son of ten for crawling round under the dining-room table with a mat over his shoulders, and pretending to be a bear.|$|E

2500|$|On March 14, 1999, Hole officially {{announced}} their {{withdrawal from the}} tour as they took the stage at The Forum arena. Love cited public ridicule {{as well as the}} inability of the two groups to resolve the financial issues related to Manson's expensive production among their reasons. Due to their 50/50 arrangement, Hole inadvertently subsidized a huge portion of the large cost of mounting Manson's shows which depleted their revenue. At their final performance, Love told the audience, [...] "We're history after this. You'll get to see the crack of someone's ass (a reference to Manson's habit <b>of</b> dropping <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> onstage). It will be fun."
