25|$|The {{ingredients}} for inventing the photomultiplier were coming together during the 1920s as {{the pace of}} vacuum tube technology accelerated. The primary goal for many, if not most, workers was {{the need for a}} practical television camera technology. Television had been pursued with primitive prototypes for decades prior to the 1934 introduction of the first practical camera (the iconoscope). Early prototype television cameras lacked sensitivity. Photomultiplier technology was pursued to enable television camera tubes, such as the iconoscope and (later) the <b>orthicon,</b> to be sensitive enough to be practical. So the stage was set to combine the dual phenomena of photoemission (i.e., the photoelectric effect) with secondary emission, both of which had already been studied and adequately understood, to create a practical photomultiplier.|$|E
25|$|A {{photomultiplier}} is a phototube whose sensitivity {{is greatly}} increased {{through the use}} of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of secondary emission, whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a dynode causing more electrons to be released from that dynode. Those electrons are accelerated toward another dynode at a higher voltage, releasing more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid-state photodetectors, the single-photon detection capability of photomultiplier tubes makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of ionizing radiation {{as an alternative to the}} Geiger–Müller tube (itself not an actual vacuum tube). Historically, the image <b>orthicon</b> TV camera tube widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication.|$|E
25|$|Near graduation, {{he applied}} for a {{research}} job at Bell Labs, which he received. After a year to establish himself there, he married Maude Rosenbaum, whom he had met in St. Louis and dated while at Purdue. The work Mueller did at Bell Labs deferred him from being drafted into the military during World War II. He initially researched <b>orthicon</b> technology, but, as Bell Labs geared up for war, it later became heavily involved in airborne radar technology. As the war progressed, his group was given the task of building the first airborne radar for Bell. Ultimately, the radar designed by MIT was chosen over the Bell Labs system, but not until after Mueller became spectacularly sick while flight testing Bell Labs' radar {{on a visit to}} Wright Airfield in Ohio. He continued his work on magnetrons and said he came close to co-inventing the transistor. If he and his co-workers had placed their contacts on a single crystal of zircon rather than working with multiple crystals, they would have beaten Shockley's team, also at Bell Labs.|$|E
25|$|Getters act by {{chemically}} {{combining with}} residual or infiltrating gases, but {{are unable to}} counteract (non-reactive) inert gases. A known problem, mostly affecting valves with large envelopes such as cathode ray tubes and camera tubes such as iconoscopes, <b>orthicons,</b> and image <b>orthicons,</b> comes from helium infiltration. The effect appears as impaired or absent functioning, and as a diffuse glow along the electron stream inside the tube. This effect cannot be rectified (short of re-evacuation and resealing), and is responsible for working examples of such tubes becoming rarer and rarer. Unused ("New Old Stock") tubes can also exhibit inert gas infiltration, {{so there is no}} long-term guarantee of these tube types surviving into the future.|$|R
50|$|Plumbicon is a {{registered}} trademark of Philips for its Lead(II) oxide (PbO) target vidicons. Used frequently in broadcast camera applications, these tubes have low output, but a high signal-to-noise ratio. They had excellent resolution compared to Image <b>Orthicons,</b> but lacked the artificially sharp edges of IO tubes, which caused some of the viewing audience to perceive them as softer. CBS Labs invented the first outboard edge enhancement circuits to sharpen the edges of Plumbicon generated images.|$|R
5000|$|A {{standards}} converter {{was used to}} provide the 405 line service, but according {{to more than one}} former RTÉ engineering source the converter blew up and afterwards the 405 line service was provided by a 405 line camera pointing at a monitor. This is not the best conversion technique but it can work if one is going from a higher resolution to a lower one [...] - [...] at the same frame rate. Slow phosphors are required on both <b>orthicons.</b>|$|R
500|$|The Emmy {{was named}} after an [...] "Immy", an affectionate term {{used to refer to}} the image <b>orthicon</b> camera tube. The {{statuette}} was designed by Louis McManus, who modeled the award after his wife, Dorothy. The Emmy statuette is fifteen inches tall from base to tip. The statuette weighs 5 pounds and is composed of iron, pewter, zinc and gold.|$|E
500|$|In 1960 Philips invented an imaging tube {{called the}} Plumbicon {{to replace the}} vidicon and Image <b>Orthicon</b> tubes used in studio {{television}} cameras. The technical advantages of this new tube allowed true color fidelity {{to be seen in}} television broadcasts for the first time. In 1967 the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences presented Philips with an Emmy Award for [...] "Outstanding Achievement in Engineering Development" [...] for the invention of the Plumbicon tube.|$|E
500|$|The Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series Directing Team is {{an award}} {{presented}} annually by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) and Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS).

Therefore, between 1974 and 1978; the award only honored individual directors. In 1979, the award was renamed Outstanding Direction for a Drama Series before using its current title years later. Since then, the award has honored {{the performances of}} the entire directing team participating in a form of a daytime drama. The awards ceremony was not aired on television in 1983 and 1984, having been criticized for lack of integrity.

2500|$|In 1959 Bob Coulson {{established}} Traveling-wave {{tube and}} Microwave tube sections {{and they were}} producing ceramic hydrogen thyratrons as well.

A year later they won an EMMY award for outstanding contribution to Electronics Technology in developing the 4½" [...] <b>orthicon</b> tube.|$|E
2500|$|The studio complex, which, {{in later}} years, would be affectionately known as 'the tin shed' was planned, {{designed}} and constructed by Civil and Civic Pty. Ltd. {{over a period}} of 28 weeks (from September 1961– March 1962) at a total cost of £77,912 (A$155,824). Occupying a 9400 square metre (101,000 square feet) site, the complex featured a 140-square-metre studio area and was fitted out with RCA equipment— two 4½" [...] image <b>orthicon</b> cameras were purchased for use in the studio at a cost of £8,000 (A$16 000) each. The transmitter (whose mast was erected in March 1962) was custom-designed by Co-El of Italy, and the mast EPT Limited in Sydney.|$|E
2500|$|The globe {{was changed}} {{one last time}} on 5 September 1981 to the double striped BBC1 logo, sitting below a lime green and blue globe on navy blue background. Also, the globe was repainted about this time, which {{resulted}} in South Africa having a pointed tip. The idents were generated by the Nexus <b>Orthicon</b> Display Device (abbreviated to NODD and pronounced [...] "noddy"), which worked by filming an image {{in black and white}} and electronically adding colour before the image was aired. This made it very easy for technical crew to manipulate the colours of the image for whatever reason (like a logo revamp). This technique was also used on the clock and schools idents, which were also filmed in black and white by the same camera and had colour added later on. The camera would be set up looking at a bank of clocks, idents, globes and breakdown captions and could be turned to look at any of these idents. The black and blue mirror globe was recreated to introduce Life on Mars which itself is set in the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German {{licensee}} company Telefunken. The [...] "image iconoscope" [...] ("Superikonoskop" [...] in Germany) was produced {{as a result}} of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television) in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States. The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes. Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image <b>orthicon.</b> The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955, finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the image iconoscope and multicon from 1952 to 1958.|$|E
5000|$|Albert Rose (30 March 1910 [...] - [...] 26 July 1990) was an American physicist, {{who made}} major {{contributions}} to TV video camera tubes {{such as the}} <b>orthicon,</b> image <b>orthicon,</b> and vidicon.|$|E
50|$|The image <b>orthicon,</b> (sometimes {{abbreviated}} IO) {{was common}} in American broadcasting from 1946 until 1968. A {{combination of the}} image dissector and the <b>orthicon</b> technologies, it replaced the iconoscope in the USA, which required {{a great deal of}} light to work adequately.|$|E
5000|$|Up to 1962, {{television}} studios used 3-tube image <b>orthicon</b> cameras for programmes in colour. For example, RCA {{offered the}} TK-41, GE the PC-15 and PC-25, Marconi the BD848/B3200. [...] They were all big, heavy, cameras (for example, the TK-41 with zoom lens was 5 ft long and it weighed 500 lbs). However, when properly set up, these image <b>orthicon</b> cameras could give pleasing pictures, {{which had the}} sharp crisp look that was a characteristic of the I.O. pick-up tubes (see Video camera tube - Image <b>orthicon).</b>|$|E
5000|$|While the {{iconoscope}} and {{the intermediate}} <b>orthicon</b> used capacitance between {{a multitude of}} small but discrete light sensitive collectors and an isolated signal plate for reading video information, the image <b>orthicon</b> employed direct charge readings from a continuous electronically charged collector. The resultant signal was immune to most extraneous signal [...] "crosstalk" [...] {{from other parts of}} the target, and could yield extremely detailed images. For instance, image <b>orthicon</b> cameras were used for capturing Apollo/Saturn rockets nearing orbit after the networks had phased them out, as only they could provide sufficient detail.|$|E

50|$|An image <b>orthicon</b> {{consists}} of three parts: a photocathode with an image store ("target"), a scanner that reads this image (an electron gun), and a multistage electron multiplier.|$|E
5000|$|In 1950 {{the arrival}} of the Vidicon camera tube made smaller cameras possible. 1952 saw the first Walkie-Lookie [...] "portable cameras". Image <b>Orthicon</b> tubes were still used till {{the arrival of}} the Plumbicon.|$|E
50|$|The image <b>orthicon</b> tube was {{developed}} at RCA by Albert Rose, Paul K. Weimer, and Harold B. Law. It represented a considerable {{advance in the}} television field, and after further development work, RCA created original models between 1939 and 1940. The National Defense Research Committee entered into a contract with RCA where the NDRC paid for its further development. Upon RCA's development of the more sensitive image <b>orthicon</b> tube in 1943, RCA entered into a production contract with the U.S. Navy, the first tubes being delivered in January 1944. RCA began production of image orthicons for civilian use {{in the second quarter}} of 1946.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the last}} five years of RTÉ's 405-line simulcasting, a simple <b>orthicon</b> {{converter}} was used, essentially a 405-line camera pointed at a 625-line monitor, as the more expensive system converters that RTÉ had previously used were now inoperable.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} side of the ocean, the RCA team led by Albert Rose began working in 1937 on a low-velocity {{scanning}} beam device they dubbed the <b>orthicon.</b> Iams and Rose solved the problem of guiding the beam and keeping it in focus by installing specially designed deflection plates and deflection coils near the charge storage plate to provide auniform axial magnetic field. The <b>orthicon</b> was the tube used in RCA's television demonstration at the 1939 New York World's Fair, its performance was similar to the image iconoscope's one, but it was also unstable under sudden flashes of bright light, producing [...] "the appearance of a large drop of water evaporating slowly over part of the scene".|$|E
5000|$|... 1946 RCA's TK-10 studio camera used a 3" [...] IO - Image <b>Orthicon</b> Tube with a 4 lens turret. The RCA TK-30 (1946) {{was widely}} {{used as a}} Field Camera. A TK-30 is simply a TK-10 with a {{portable}} camera control unit.|$|E
50|$|The {{iconoscope}} {{was replaced}} in Europe around 1936 by {{the much more}} sensitive Super-Emitron and Superikonoskop, while in the United States the Iconoscope was the leading camera tube used for broadcasting from 1936 until 1946, when it {{was replaced by the}} image <b>orthicon</b> tube.|$|E
5000|$|An image <b>orthicon</b> camera {{can take}} {{television}} pictures by candlelight {{because of the}} more ordered light-sensitive area {{and the presence of}} an electron multiplier {{at the base of the}} tube, which operated as a high-efficiency amplifier. It also has a logarithmic light sensitivity curve similar to the human eye. However, it tends to flare in bright light, causing a dark halo to be seen around the object; this anomaly is referred to as [...] "blooming" [...] in the broadcast industry when image <b>orthicon</b> tubes were in operation. Image orthicons were used extensively in the early color television cameras, where the increased sensitivity of the tube was essential to overcome their very inefficient optical system of the other parts of the camera.|$|E
5000|$|The 1948 Dumont Marconi MK IV was an Image <b>Orthicon</b> Camera. Marconi's first {{camera was}} shown in 1938. EMI cameras from the UK, {{were used in the}} US in the early 1960s, like the EMI 203/4. Later in the 60s the EMI 2000 and EMI 2001.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the press}} {{releases}} on Electronovision were deliberately vague, perhaps {{to add more}} mystique to the process, it used conventional analog Image <b>Orthicon</b> video camera tube units, shooting in the B&W 819-line interlaced 25fps French video standard, using modified high-band quadruplex VTRs to record the signal.|$|E
50|$|An image {{splitter}} {{was used}} in the TK-40/41 to direct the incoming light into three image <b>orthicon</b> tubes (specially designed cathode ray tubes) for recording moving pictures in the red, green, and blue component colors. The early cameras required a very large amount of lighting, which caused television studios to become very warm due to the use of multi-kilowatt lamps (a problem that still exists somewhat today, but is less pronounced). The RCA TK-40 and TK-41 color cameras required more than an hour to set up and were comparatively unstable, making frequent adjustment necessary to maintain correct color balance between the red, green, and blue primary colors. These cameras also required complicated control consoles and rack-mounted power supplies for the camera's many vacuum tubes and ventilator fans cooling their large image <b>orthicon</b> tubes.|$|E
