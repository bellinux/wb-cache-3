In contrast to these early studies, the large clinical trials were more disappointing. The results of the OCTAVE trial confirmed the antihypertensive efficacy of <b>omapatrilat,</b> but at the price of an angioedema rate more than threefold higher than that of an ACE inhibitor in the overall population (2. 17 % vs 0. 68 %), and close to fourfold higher in the black population.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Omapatrilat,</b> an {{inhibitor}} {{of neutral}} endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), {{is an effective}} antihypertensive agent. Here, we studied the relative roles of NEP and ACE inhibition and their effect on resistance artery structure and function of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) -salt hypertensive rats. Methods: <b>Omapatrilat</b> (40 mg/kg per day), the NEP inhibitor CGS 25462 (CGS, 100 mg/kg per day) and the ACE inhibitor enalapril (10 mg/kg per day), were given for 3 weeks to DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Effects on small mesenteric resistance arteries were studied on a pressurized myograph. Collagen deposition was evaluated by confocal microscopy. Results: Systolic blood pressure of DOCA-salt rats was significantly reduced (P &# 60; 0. 05) by <b>omapatrilat</b> and CGS. <b>Omapatrilat</b> and CGS treatment increased lumen diameter and decreased media width and media/lumen ratio of small arteries of DOCA-salt rats (P &# 60; 0. 05). Small artery relaxation responses to acetylcholine improved under <b>omapatrilat</b> or CGS treatment. The stress-strain curve shifted leftward in mesenteric arteries from DOCA-salt rats compared to control rats. <b>Omapatrilat</b> or CGS treatment resulted in a rightward shift, which was significantly different from that induced by enalapril. <b>Omapatrilat</b> and CGS decreased collagen deposition in the vessel wall of DOCA-salt rats.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether pharmacological enhancement of the renal kallikrein-kinin system using the vasopeptidase inhibitor <b>omapatrilat</b> plays a direct role in modulating the fibrotic responses of human mesangial cells to injury. Treatment with 40 Âµmol/L <b>omapatrilat</b> was able to reduce macrophage-conditioned medium (MPCM) -induced fibronectin levels without affecting mRNA expression. MPCM injury also suppressed kallikrein and low molecular weight kininogen mRNA. <b>Omapatrilat</b> was able to attenuate this suppression. Bradykinin levels in contrast were increased by MPCM and treatment with <b>omapatrilat</b> further augmented levels. Co-incubation with the bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist HOE 140 attenuated the omapatrilat-induced lowering of fibronectin. Moreover, inhibition of cGMP release had a similar effect. Paradoxically, RT-PCR and Southern blotting demonstrated that bradykinin B 2 receptor mRNA levels were down regulated in response to <b>omapatrilat.</b> Western blotting supported this data. Supernatant levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a product of bradykinin stimulation, were decreased by <b>omapatrilat</b> while cell associated tPA levels were increased.

40|$|Introduction Among {{individuals}} {{with a history of}} myocardial infarction (MI), higher levels of blood pressure (BP) are associated with increased long-term risks of death from coronary heart disease. Treatment with a BP-lowering regimen, based on <b>omapatrilat</b> may result in greater clinical benefits than treatment with a regimen based on a regular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor because of more favourable effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Methods Seven hundred and twenty-three clinically stable patients with a history of MI or unstable angina, and a mean entry BP of 134 / 77 mmHg, were randomised to six months treatment with <b>omapatrilat</b> 40 mg, <b>omapatrilat</b> 20 mg, or matching placebo.

The present {{study investigated the}} effect of the vasopeptidase inhibitor <b>omapatrilat</b> on endothelinâ 1 (ETâ 1) âmediated vascular function in saltâinduced hypertension. Methods. âDahl saltâsensitive rats (n= 6 /group) on standard or saltâenriched (4 % NaCl) chow were treated for 8 weeks with either <b>omapatrilat</b> (36 Â± 4 [*]mg/kg/day), captopril (94 Â± 2 [*]mg/kg/day) or placebo. Aortic and renal artery segments were isolated and suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. Functional endothelinâconverting enzyme (ECE) activity was assessed in native segments and after preincubation with <b>omapatrilat.</b> Furthermore, vascular ECE protein levels as well as plasma and tissue ETâ 1 levels were determined. Results. âThe increase in systolic blood pressure of saltâfed rats was prevented by <b>omapatrilat</b> and captopril to a comparable degree. In saltâinduced hypertension, functional ECE activity (calculated as the ratio of the contraction to big ETâ 1 divided by the contraction to ETâ 1) in renal arteries (0. 46 Â± 0. 05) and in aorta (0. 68 Â± 0. 05) was reduced as compared with control animals (0. 9 Â± 0. 05 and 0. 99 Â± 0. 04, respectively; P< 0. 05). While <b>omapatrilat</b> in vitro blunted the response to big endothelinâ 1 (big ETâ 1) and diminished ECE activity further (P< 0. 01 vs native segments), chronic treatment with <b>omapatrilat</b> in vivo restored contractions to ETâ 1 (120 Â± 6 %) and big ETâ 1 (98 Â± 9 %) in renal arteries, and therefore normalized renovascular ECE activity.

40|$|Hypertension remains {{uncontrolled}} worldwide {{despite the}} availability of several classes of antihypertensive agents. There is {{an increased risk of}} serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal events if the disease goes untreated or is poorly treated. Thus, the high incidence of hypertension coupled with its poor control make it imperative that more effective and well-tolerated treatments that exhibit target-organ protection be developed. Vasopeptidase inhibitors are a new class of cardiovascular agents that simultaneously inhibit neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme. They enhance peptides with vasodilatory and possibly organ-protective properties and also inhibit the production of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} was to compare the effects of the vasopeptidase {{inhibitor}} <b>omapatrilat</b> and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) captopril in the postmyocardial infarction (MI) rat model. BackgroundThe cardioprotective effects of ACEIs after MI are thought to be partially due to an increase in bradykinin (BK). Vasopeptidase inhibitors inhibit both ACE and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), further reduce BK metabolism and increase natriuretic peptides, which may result in better cardioprotective effects than with ACEIs after MI. MethodsMyocardial infarction was induced in 514 Wistar male rats by ligation of the anterior coronary artery. Rats surviving 4 h after MI (n = 282) were assigned to <b>omapatrilat</b> (40 or 80 mg/kg/day), captopril (160 mg/kg/day) or no treatment. After 56 days, neurohumoral, hemodynamic, ventricular remodeling, morphometry, immunohistochemistry and cardiac cytokine expression were measured. ResultsOmapatrilat and captopril resulted in similarly improved survival, cardiac hemodynamics and reduced cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy after MI. The pattern of left ventricular (LV) remodeling differed, <b>omapatrilat</b> causing less attenuation of the rightward shift of the LV pressure-volume relation at lower filling pressures than captopril. Both interventions reduced messenger ribonucleic acid expression of the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-Î² 1; neither effected the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 10, and only captopril reduced the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±). Expression of TNF-Î± was in cardiomyocytes. Both medications reduced circulating endothelin- 1, angiotensin II and catecholamines, but only <b>omapatrilat</b> increased atrial natriuretic peptides. ConclusionsThis study indicates that both <b>omapatrilat</b> and captopril markedly improve post-MI survival, cardiac function and cardiac remodeling in the rat. It would appear that the addition of NEP inhibition to those of ACEIs does not result in significant further benefit after MI...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to analyze the chronic renal response to <b>omapatrilat,</b> a new vasopeptidase inhibitor, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). To that end, the renal and blood pressure response to a 4 -day salt loading protocol was analyzed and the respective chronic renal curves constructed. Results In non treated animals, and under normal sodium intake (around 2 mEq/day), mean arterial pressure (MAP), was significantly higher in the SHR as compared with the controls (WKY). After increasing salt intake (8 times normal), MAP did not change significantly in any group and the animals reached a normal sodium balance in four days. In a second group of animals, <b>omapatrilat</b> was given orally for 15 days at the dose of 40 mg/kg/day in the drinking water. In these omapatrilat-treated animals, and under normal sodium intake, MAP was significantly lower in both groups, although the antihypertensive effect was much greater in the SHR, so that the MAP of the SHR group was completely normalized and similar to the WKY-treated group. The subsequent elevation of sodium intake did not significantly elevate MAP in any group and the animals could manage the sodium excess as well as the non treated groups. Conclusions These results indicate that chronic treatment with <b>omapatrilat</b> normalizes blood pressure in SHR without affecting adversely the renal ability to eliminate a sodium load. Chronic treatment with <b>omapatrilat</b> resets the chronic pressure natriuresis relationship of the SHR to a normal level, thus without altering the normal salt-independence of this arterial hypertension model. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractâTo {{determine}} whether natriuretic peptides {{in addition to}} the renin-angiotensin system are involved in functional and structural vascular changes in salt-sensitive hypertension, we compared equipotent hypotensive treatment with the dual neutral endopeptidase/ACE inhibitor <b>omapatrilat</b> (35 mg z kg 21 z d 21) or the ACE inhibitor captopril (100 mg z kg 21 z d 21). The reactivity and geometry of mesenteric resistance arteries from Dahl salt-sensitive rats were studied in vitro under perfused and pressurized conditions. Chronic salt administration increased systolic blood pressure by 5764 mm Hg, whereas concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide were reduced in heart and in plasma (P, 0. 05). In addition, the medial cross-sectional area of small mesenteric arteries was increased and endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to acetylcholine and contraction in response to endothelin- 1 were impaired in the mesenteric arteries of salt-sensitive rats on a high-salt diet (P, 0. 05). Concomitant treatment with either <b>omapatrilat</b> or captopril reduced the increase in systolic blood pressure and hypertrophic remodeling to a similar degree (P, 0. 05) but affected plasma and cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide levels differently (P, 0. 05). In addition, <b>omapatrilat</b> normalized endothelium-dependent relaxations {{to a greater extent than}} captopril (P, 0. 05). Furthermore, vasopeptidase inhibition increased cGMP levels compared with captopril (P, 0. 05). Contractions to endothelin- 1 were normalized by either antihypertensive drug. These results suggest that in the Dahl rat, with similar reductions in systolic blood pressure, <b>omapatrilat</b> is superior to captopril in preventing impaired endothelial function in small resistance arteries.

40|$|This multicenter, {{double-blind}} study evaluated efficacy {{and safety of}} the vasopeptidase inhibitor <b>omapatrilat,</b> which simultaneously inhibits neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme, when given in conjunc-tion with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) to subjects nonre-sponsive to HCTZ alone. The study enrolled 657 subjects with mild to severe hypertension. After a 2 -week placebo lead-in period and a 4 -week HCTZ phase, 274 subjects were randomized to receive <b>omapatrilat</b> (10 or 20 mg, electively titrated to 20 or 40 mg, respectively, at week 4 if seated diastolic blood pressure [SeDBP] was $ 90 mm Hg) or matching placebo in addition to 25 mg of HCTZ as continuing therapy. The primary outcome measure was change in SeDBP from baseline to week 8. At week 8, placebo plus HCTZ-adjusted additional reductions in SeDBP in the <b>omapatrilat</b> 10 / 20 mg and 20 / 40 mg treat-ment groups (4 and 5 mm Hg, respectively) were signifi-cant (P,. 001), as were changes in seated systolic blood pressure in both omapatrilat-treated groups (7 and 10 mm Hg, respectively; P,. 001).

The dual angiotensin con-verting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor <b>omapatrilat</b> improves small artery remodeling in hypertension. The {{aim of the}} present study was to compare effects of <b>omapatrilat</b> to the ACE inhibitor fosinopril and the AT 1 antagonist irbesartan on the coronary microvas-culature in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Ten-week-old SHR were treated for 10 weeks with <b>omapatrilat</b> (20 or 40 mg/kg/d), irbesartan (50 mg/kg/d), or fosinopril (20 mg/kg/d). Arterioles and capillaries were identified in the myocardium by immunolabeling. After 10 weeks, sys-tolic blood pressure (BP) was significantly reduced in treated versus untreated SHR (P. 01). Myocardial arte-riolar density/mm 2 was higher (P. 05) in untreated SHR versus Wistar-Kyoto (WKY), and was reduced by oma-patrilat (at both high and low doses) and by fosinopril (P. 01). Irbesartan decreased only subepicardial arteriolar density (P. 05). Myocardial capillary density/mm 2 was decreased in untreated SHR versus WKY (P. 01), associated with increase in cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area and cardiomyocyte-to-capillary ratio, and a decrease in myocyte density. <b>Omapatrilat</b> (at both high and low doses) resulted in increased capillary density, decreased myocyte hypertrophy and cardiomyocyte to capillary ratio, and increased myocyte density (P. 01). Fosinopril and irbesartan reduced myocyte hypertrophy of SHR, but had no effect on capillary density. Dual ACE/NEP inhibition was more effective than ACE inhibition or AT 1 antago-nism in improving microvascular and cardiomyocyte re-modeling in the hypertensive heart.

40|$|Vasopeptidase {{inhibition}} and Ang-(1 - 7) in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. BackgroundOmapatrilat, a new vasopeptidase inhibitor, inhibits {{the activity}} of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase 24. 11 (NEP). Because these two enzymes participate in the degradation of the vasodilator and natriuretic peptide, angiotensin-(1 - 7) [Ang-(1 - 7) ], we assessed whether <b>omapatrilat</b> treatment is associated with changes in the plasma and urinary excretion rates of the angiotensins. MethodsWe investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (0. 24 kg body weight) the effect of <b>omapatrilat</b> on plasma and urinary concentrations of angiotensin (Ang) I, Ang II and Ang-(1 - 7) during 17 days of administration of either the drug (N = 15, 100 Î¼mol/kg/day) or vehicle (N = 14) in the drinking water. Hemodynamic and renal excretory function studies were associated with histological examination of the expression of Ang-(1 - 7) in the kidneys of both vehicle and omapatrilat-treated SHRs. ResultsOmapatrilat induced a sustained lowering of systolic blood pressure (- 68 mm Hg) without changes in cardiac rate. The mild positive water balance produced by <b>omapatrilat</b> did not cause natriuresis or kaliuresis, although it {{was associated with a}} significant decrease in urine osmolality. Blood pressure normalization was accompanied by increases in plasma Ang I (2969 %), Ang II (57 %), and Ang-(1 - 7) (163 %) levels, paralleling pronounced increases in urinary excretion rates of Ang I and Ang-(1 - 7) but not Ang II. Detection of Ang-(1 - 7) immunostaining in the kidneys of five other SHR exposed either to vehicle (N = 3) or <b>omapatrilat</b> (N = 2) ascertained the source of the Ang-(1 - 7) found in the urine. Intense Ang-(1 - 7) staining, more pronounced in omapatrilat-treated SHR, was found in renal proximal tubules throughout the outer and inner regions of the renal cortex and the thick ascending loop of Henle, whereas no Ang-(1 - 7) -positive immunostaining was found in glomeruli and distal tubules. ConclusionsOmapatrilat antihypertensive effects caused significant activation of the renin-angiotensin system associated with increases in urinary excretion rates of Ang I and Ang-(1 - 7). Combined studies of Ang-(1 - 7) metabolism in urine and immunohistochemical studies in the kidney revealed the existence of an intrarenal source, which may account for the pronounced increase in the excretion rate of the vasodilator heptapeptide. These findings provide further evidence for a contribution of Ang-(1 - 7) to the regulation of renal function and blood pressure...|$|E
