50|$|Appraisal {{theory is}} the theory in {{psychology}} that emotions are extracted from our evaluations (appraisals or estimates) {{of events that}} cause specific reactions in different people. Essentially, our appraisal of a situation causes an emotional, or affective, response {{that is going to}} be based on that appraisal. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on a first date. If the date is perceived as positive, one might feel happiness, joy, giddiness, excitement, and/or anticipation, because they have appraised this event as one that could have positive long-term effects, i.e. starting a new relationship, engagement, or even marriage. On the other hand, if the date is perceived negatively, then our emotions, as a result, might include dejection, sadness, emptiness, or fear. (Scherer et al., 2001) Reasoning and understanding of one's emotional reaction becomes important for future appraisals as well. The important aspect of the appraisal theory is that it accounts for individual variances of emotional reactions to the same event.|$|E

5000|$|The Emotional Freedom Technique or EFT {{is a form}} of {{psychological}} acupuncture that is very similar to TFT. The treatment begins by first having the patient select a problem that is causing them distress. [...] Then they name the emotion that they are feeling at the current time and identify the body part where they are feeling the emotion. [...] For example, a patient may be feeling sadness in the pit of their stomach. The whole point is to have the patient overcome this emotion by accepting themselves. They do this by placing pressure on certain points in the body, while verbally stating that they accept themselves for who they are. While all <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on, they also will perform other tasks such as rolling their eyes from side to side. The technique combines exposure, cognitive resurrecting, waking hypnosis, and physical relaxation while tapping on a sequence of pressure points and repeating key phrases out loud. [...] It is believed that the physical stimulation of certain pressure points during exposure to an emotional trauma may send deactivating signals directly to the amygdala, also known as the fear center of the brain.|$|E

Twelve strategic areas within South Africa have been identified and {{are in the process}} of, or have been, declared IDZs. East London and Coega are the first two IDZs to come online in South Africa and have generated much publicity in the past number of years. One of the aims of the IDZs, as world-class production areas, is to generate FDI. Drivers of international FDI include globalisation, political, economic and legal environments and competitive advantage. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (2002 : 25), FDI accounts for 16 percent of worldwide gross fixed capital formation – and a growing proportion <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to developing nations. According to the World Economic Processing Zones Association (WEPZA), IDZs have been the star performer in attracting investment and technology to developing countries during the past 50 years (2002 : www. wepza. org). If the Eastern Cape IDZ programme is to be a success, the development corporations that have been established as the management arms of the IDZs will need to facilitate strategic economic advantage, look towards strategic investments that are sustainable, take advantage of and grow existing industrial capacity and create economic and social benefits for the region. There are a number of dynamics and reasons behind global FDI decisions. In order to be successful at attracting FDI the development corporations need to understand these dynamics and reasons in order to achieve a strategic fit between potential investor and the IDZ.
