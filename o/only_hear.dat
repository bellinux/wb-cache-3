5|$|The Provisional Government also {{included}} a judiciary. The forerunner of the Oregon Supreme Court consisted of a single Supreme Judge and two justices of the peace. The Supreme Judge was elected by the people, but the legislature could select someone as presiding judge as a replacement if needed. This Supreme Court had original and appellate jurisdiction over legal matters, whereas the lower probate court and justice courts that were also created could <b>only</b> <b>hear</b> original jurisdictional matters when the amount in controversy was less than $50 and did not involve land disputes. Some judges under the Provisional Government were Nathaniel Ford, Peter H. Burnett, Osborne Russell, Ira L. Babcock, and future United States Senator James W. Nesmith.|$|E
5|$|The Court has no {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} most cases, {{meaning that it}} can <b>only</b> <b>hear</b> cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in lower courts. Most cases begin in local circuit courts, where the initial trial is held and a jury decides {{the outcome of the}} case. The circuit court decision can be appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals or the Indiana Tax Court, who can hear the case or enforce the lower court's decision. If the parties still disagree with the outcome of the case, they can appeal the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court. The Court can choose to hear the case and possibly overturn the previous judgment, or it can decline to accept the case and uphold the decision of the lower courts.|$|E

25|$|The Indiana Supreme Court {{is made up}} of five judges with a Court of Appeals {{composed}} of 15judges. The governor selects judges for the supreme and appeal courts from a group of applicants chosen by a special commission. After serving for two years, the judges must acquire the support of the electorate to serve for a 10-year term. In nearly all cases, the Supreme Court does not have original jurisdiction and can <b>only</b> <b>hear</b> cases that are petitioned to the court following being heard in lower courts. Local circuit courts are where the majority of cases begin with a trial and the consequence decided by the jury. The Supreme Court does have original and sole jurisdiction in certain specific areas including the practice of law, discipline or disbarment of Judges appointed to the lower state courts, and supervision over the exercise of jurisdiction by the other lower courts of the State.|$|E

25|$|Green {{sea turtles}} {{tend to have}} good vision, well adapted to a life at sea. The turtles can see many colors, but are most {{sensitive}} to light from violet to yellow or wavelengths of 400 to 600 nanometers. They do not see many colors in the orange to red portion of the light spectrum. On land, however, the sea turtles are nearsighted because the lenses in the eyes are spherical and adjusted to refraction underwater. Sea turtles have no external ear and only one ear bone, called the columella. With one ear bone, the turtles can <b>only</b> <b>hear</b> low frequency sounds, from 200 to 700Hz. Sounds can also be detected through vibrations of the head, backbone, and shell. The nose of the turtle has two external openings and connects {{to the roof of}} the mouth through internal openings. The lower surface of the nasal passage has two sets of sensory cells called the Jacobson’s organ. The turtle can use this organ to smell by pumping water in and out of its nose.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to learn the outcome of patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) in their <b>only</b> <b>hearing</b> ear. Timing to conduct a cochlear implantation was also determined in {{those who did not}} recover the hearing. The study group comprised 25 patients who confronted ISSNHL in their <b>only</b> <b>hearing</b> ear. A total of 192 patients, who had ISSNHL in one ear and had normal contralateral ear, served as the control. Demographically {{there were no significant differences}} between the groups. The recovery rate was similar between the groups: 64. 0 % in the experimental and 62. 5 % in the control group. The duration until the recovery of ISSNHL in the <b>only</b> <b>hearing</b> ear was 5 - 90 days (average 17. 6 days). In the experimental group, 8 patients did not recover from ISSNHL, and underwent cochlear implantation in 6 with satisfactory results. These results suggest that the same treatment is applicable for patients with ISSNHL regardless of whether their contralateral ear is deaf or normal. For those who do not recover from ISSNHL in their <b>only</b> <b>hearing</b> ear, culminating in bilateral deafness, we may consider further definitive treatment including cochlear implantation as early as 3 months after initiating the treatment of ISSNHL...|$|R

[...] R singers T-Pain and Dwele, New York rappers Mos Def and ALBe. Back, and famed hip-hop record producer DJ Premier are featured in individual tracks primarily to deliver hooks and refrains. However, though he originally intended for Graduation to be completely devoid of guest rap verses, West decided to invite New Orleans rapper Lil Wayne on the track [...] "Barry Bonds". At the time, the two MCs had been working together, with West contributing to the production of Lil Wayne's sixth studio album Tha Carter III. As for the absence of skits, West explained, [...] "There's just serious songs, hooks, chords, and ideas. No special effects or antics ... and no fake Bernie Mac!" [...] West instead decided to record two earthy musical interludes in place of the hip-hop skits. He incorporated African sounds and polyrhythmic percussion into both. However, for unknown reasons, the two musical interludes were omitted from the studio album.|$|E

After noticing the man's name and verifying that he had indeed sent Hale some venison, Hale refused to let the case proceed until he had paid the man for the food. When Sir John Croke, suspected in engaging in a conspiracy, sent him some sugar loaves to excuse his absence from a case, Hale remarked that [...] "I cannot think that Sir John believes that the King's Justices come into the country to take bribes. Some other person, having a design to put a trick upon him, sent them in his name". Hale returned the loaves, and refused to continue until Croke appeared before him. Hale was noted during this period for giving latitude to those accused of religious impropriety, and through doing so [...] "secured the confidence and affection of all classes of his countrymen". His knowledge of equity was considered as great as his knowledge of the law, and Lord Nottingham, considered the [...] "father of equity", [...] "worshipped Hale as a great master".|$|E

It was also reported that The Voice executives always edit the vocals for every artist on the show, and they would [...] "provide some finishing touches to her singing prior to it being broadcast." [...] As the performance began, Cheryl swan-dived onto her backing dancers before they performed a highly ellaborated routine. Following the broadcast, Cheryl received mixed comments from viewers, with a few who accused the singer of lip synching, while others, including pop singers Emma Bunton and will.i.am, praised the performance. In an interview with BBC News, Cheryl addressed the negative comments, and said that [...] "if you think my live vocal sounds so good it must be mimed, I'm happy, I take it as a compliment." [...] She performed the track again on The Graham Norton Show on 8 June 2012, and was also accused of lip synching. Cheryl also performed [...] "Call My Name" [...] at Capital FM Summertime Ball on 9 June 2012 in front of 80,000 fans at the Wembley Stadium, she was a surprise artist.

2500|$|The Reformation, {{carried out}} in Scotland in the mid-sixteenth century and heavily {{influenced}} by Calvinism, amounted to a revolution in religious practice. It led to the abolition of auricular confession, the wafer in mass, which was no longer seen as a [...] "work", Latin in services, prayers to Mary and the Saints and the doctrine of Purgatory.

In place of all this were a plain table for communion, pews for the congregation, pulpits and lecterns for the sermons that were now the focus of worship. Printed sermons indicate that they could be as long as three hours. Until the 1590s most parishes were not served by a minister, but by readers, who could not preach or administer the sacraments.

2500|$|Shortly before independence, {{which took}} place in 1964, a Local Courts Ordinance in 1962 amended the 1933 Native Courts legislation, and {{recognised}} several levels of courts with varying powers to hear disputes based on customary law and some criminal cases. After independence, this ordinance was renamed the Traditional Courts Act, 1962. The local courts set up were no longer solely the courts of traditional chiefs, as had been the case under the 1933 legislation, although many such chiefs were appointed to them. This legislation provided guarantees of a fair trial, including the possibility of legal representation and the right to appeal to the High Court.
