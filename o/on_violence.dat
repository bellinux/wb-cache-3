5|$|Reviews of Spec Ops: The Line {{were mostly}} positive, with many critics praising the narrative, themes, and the provocative take <b>on</b> <b>violence</b> in video games, but {{noted that it}} failed to {{innovate}} or present a strong multiplayer component. Many critics consider the game to be underrated, or overlooked. Previews of the game, {{as well as the}} game itself, were banned in the United Arab Emirates for the depiction of Dubai in a state of destruction.|$|E
5|$|Since the attack, Canadians have debated various {{interpretations of}} the events, their significance, and Lépine's motives. Many feminist groups and public {{officials}} have characterized the massacre as an anti-feminist attack that is representative of wider societal violence against women. Consequently, {{the anniversary of the}} massacre has since been commemorated as the National Day of Remembrance and Action <b>on</b> <b>Violence</b> Against Women. Other interpretations emphasize Lépine's abuse as a child or suggest that the massacre was simply the isolated act of a madman, unrelated to larger social issues. Still other commentators have blamed violence in the media and increasing poverty, isolation, and alienation in society, particularly in immigrant communities.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. State {{department}} {{considers that}} “discrimination against women {{is a significant}} problem” in Saudi Arabia and that women have few political or social rights. After her 2008 visit, the UN special rapporteur <b>on</b> <b>violence</b> against women noted the lack of women's autonomy {{and the absence of}} a law criminalizing violence against women. The World Economic Forum 2012 Global Gender Gap Report ranked Saudi Arabia 131st out of 135 countries for gender parity, ahead of Syria, Chad, Pakistan and Yemen.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{with severe}} mental illness, {{including}} schizophrenia, {{are at a}} significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non-violent crime. Schizophrenia {{has been associated with}} a higher rate of violent acts, but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse. Rates of homicide linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region. What role schizophrenia has <b>on</b> <b>violence</b> independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors. About 11% of people in prison for homicide have schizophrenia while 21% have mood disorders. Another study found about 8-10% of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2% of the general population.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, King—a {{prominent}} African-American {{civil rights}} leader—was assassinated. Race riots subsequently broke {{out across the}} United States. After delivering an improvised speech on the matter in Indianapolis, Kennedy withdrew to the hotel he was staying in and suspended his presidential campaign. Community leaders convinced him to keep a single engagement before the City Club of Cleveland. Doing away with his prepared remarks, Kennedy's speechwriters worked early into the morning of April 5 creating a full response to the assassination. Kennedy reviewed and revised the draft during his flight to Cleveland. Speaking in a tragic mode for only ten minutes before 2,200 people, Kennedy outlined his view <b>on</b> <b>violence</b> in American society. He criticized both the rioters and the white establishment who, from his perspective, {{were responsible for the}} deterioration of social conditions in the United States. He proposed no specific solutions to the internal division and conflict, but admonished the audience to seek common ground and try to cooperate with other Americans.|$|E

25|$|Findings <b>on</b> <b>violence</b> {{committed}} {{by those with}} mental disorders in the community have been inconsistent and related to numerous factors; {{a higher rate of}} more serious offences such as homicide have sometimes been found but, despite high-profile homicide cases, the evidence suggests this has not been increased by deinstitutionalisation. The aggression and violence that does occur, in either direction, is usually within family settings rather than between strangers.|$|E
25|$|In April 1975, Ontario Premier William Davis chose her to {{head the}} Ontario government's Royal Commission <b>on</b> <b>Violence</b> in the Communications Industry. It spent two years coming up with 68 recommendations, many highly {{controversial}} ones like an omnibus government agency controlling all television content, and newspapers to be governed by a national council on ethics, that would police the industry for violations.
