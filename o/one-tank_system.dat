The definitive version is available at: [URL] SOFTANK model optimally designs the watershed-based tank system by simulating field, tank, and groundwater balances. We applied this model to a small watershed consisting of six tanks (small reservoirs) in the semiarid region of India. We evaluated the existing tank system in this watershed and compared it to a <b>one-tank</b> <b>system.</b> Results showed that one tank at the outlet of the watershed would have been more beneficial [with benefit-cost (BC) ratio of 1. 80] than the existing six-tank system (with BC ratio of 1. 71). Finally, we performed the analysis for obtaining the optimal tank system for the watershed, and we found that the tanks for irrigation purposes are not economical for the small watershed. The groundwater source was enough for irrigation, so any additional investment in the tanks would be uneconomical. The results demonstrate the importance of the watershed-based tank system approach to design...|$|E
40|$|A general concern when {{considering}} the implementation of domestic grey water recycling is to understand the impacts of system factors on water saving efficiency. Key factors include household occupancy, storage volumes, treatment capacity and operating mode. Earlier investigations of the impacts of these key factors {{were based on a}} <b>one-tank</b> <b>system</b> only. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the effect of these factors on the performance of a more realistic 'two tank' system with treatment using an object based household water cycle model. A Monte-Carlo simulation technique was adopted to generate domestic water appliance usage data which allows long-term prediction of the system's performance to be made. Model results reveal the constraints of treatment capacity, storage tank sizes and operating mode on percentage of potable water saved. A treatment capacity threshold has been discovered at which water saving efficiency is maximised for a given pair of grey and treated grey water tank. Results from the analysis suggest that the previous one-tank model significantly underestimates the tank volumes required for a given target water saving efficiency. © 2010 Desalination Publications.

40|$|Abstract: The {{teaching}} of fuzzy and advanced control strategies at bachelor level is {{correlated with the}} usually heuristic means of fuzzy control, incorporating human skills, the drawback being in the lack of general-purpose development methods. A major problem, which follows {{from the study of}} advanced control strategies is the understanding of its background the basic development methods and some applications. The paper, organized in two parts, present control algorithms exemplified on four case studies in teaching Advanced Control Engineering courses: temperature control, level control in a <b>one-tank</b> <b>system,</b> speed control and position for an inverted pendulum. PI(D) control (based on ESOm and 2 p-SO-m tuning criterions), Internal Model Control (IMC) Smith-predictor and Fuzzy control strategies are presented underlining the problem of bump transfer when switching between manual and automatic modes or between two controllers occurs. Also a Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) strategy is presented and combined with static linearization using the inverse static characteristics of the plant. The case studies presented here are assisted by laboratory experiments. The case studies concerning fuzzy controlled servo-systems, accompanied by digital simulation results and real-time experimental results, validate the presented methods. Keywords: control strategies, PI(D) control, fuzzy control, IMC and GPC strategies, bumpless transfer * Zsuzsa Preitl was teaching assistant at “Politehnica ” University of Timisoara in the academic year 2004 - 2005 and she participated in the development of laboratory activities...|$|E
40|$|The giant {{freshwater}} prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, and {{the marine}} shrimp, Penaeus monodon, are now becoming {{the most important}} cultured species in Malaysia. The progress in the aquaculture of these species {{has led to the}} development of hatcheries in various parts of the country. To date, a total of 50 hatcheries are now in operation. 								 											 Fry production technology varies between hatcheries. For M. rosenbergii, clear-water, closed system, and green-water larviculture techniques are common. For P. monodon, the two-tank and <b>one-tank</b> larviculture <b>systems</b> are used. A range of problems such as lack of skilled hatchery personnel, larval diseases, and lack of financial support hampers hatchery operations. In order to ensure the continued operation of the hatcheries, the Department of Fisheries (Malaysia) is providing the necessary support services and technical assistance...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{identify}} and quantify the additional risks related to hydrogen explosions during the operation of a hydrogen driven car. In a first attempt the accidents or failures of a simple <b>one-tank</b> hydrogen storage <b>system</b> has been studied as a main source of risk. Three types of initiators are taken into account: crash accidents, fire accidents without crash (no other cars are involved) and hydrogen leakages in normal situation with following ignition. The consequences of hydrogen ignition and/or explosion depend strongly on environmental conditions (geometry, wind, etc.), therefore the different configurations of operational and environmental conditions are specified. Then Event Tree / Fault Tree methods are applied for the risk assessment. The results of quantification permit to draw conclusions about the overall added risk of hydrogen technology as well as about the main contributors to the risk. Results of this work will eventually contribute to the on-going pre-normative research in the field of hydrogen safety. JRC. DDG. F. 2 -Cleaner energ...|$|R
40|$|Thermal energy can {{be stored}} by the {{mechanism}} of sensible or latent heat or heat from chemical reactions. Sensible heat is the means of storing energy by increasing {{the temperature of the}} solid or liquid. Since the concrete as media cost per kWhthermal is $ 1, this seems to be a very economical material {{to be used as a}} TES. This research is focused on extending the concrete TES system for higher temperatures (500 ÃÂºC to 600 ÃÂºC) and increasing the heat transfer performance using novel construction techniques. To store heat at high temperature special concretes are developed and tested for its performance. The storage capacity costs of the developed concrete is in the range of $ 0. 91 -$ 3. 02 /kWhthermal Two different storage methods are investigated. In the first one heat is transported using molten slat through a stainless steel tube and heat is transported into concrete block through diffusion. The cost of the system is higher than the targeted DOE goal of $ 15 /kWhthermal The increase in cost of the system is due to stainless steel tube to transfer the heat from molten salt to the concrete blocks. The other method is a <b>one-tank</b> thermocline <b>system</b> in which both the hot and cold fluid occupy the same tank resulting in reduced storage tank volume. In this model, heated molten salt enters the top of the tank which contains a packed bed of quartzite rock and silica sand as the thermal energy storage (TES) medium. The single-tank storage system uses about half the salt that is required by the two-tank system for a required storage capacity. This amounts to a significant reduction in the cost of the storage system. The single tank alternative has also been proven to be cheaper than the option which uses large concrete modules with embedded heat exchangers. Using computer models optimum dimensions are determined to have an round trip efficiency of 84 %. Additionally, the cost of the structured concrete thermocline configuration provides the TES capacity cost of $ 33. 80 $/kWhthermal compared with $ 30. 04 /kWhthermal for a packed-bed thermocline (PBTC) configuration and $ 46. 11 /kWhthermal for a two-tank liquid configuration...|$|R
