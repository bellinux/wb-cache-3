5|$|The JNA's planned {{campaign}} {{included an}} {{advance in the}} Šibenik area by the 9th (Knin) Corps, which was tasked with isolating Dalmatia {{from the rest of}} Croatia. As it was fully mobilised and prepared for deployment, the corps began operations against the ZNG on 16 September. Its main axis <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> <b>directed</b> at Vodice, with supporting advances towards Zadar, Drniš and Sinj. The push was designed to create favourable circumstances to attack Zadar, Šibenik and Split. With support from a corps-level battalion of M-84 tanks and the SAO Krajina Territorial Defence, the JNA 221st Mechanised Brigade (without its battalion of T-34 tanks), was committed to the main axis of the attack. The secondary advance, towards Biograd na Moru on the right flank, was assigned to the 180th Mechanised Brigade, supported by the armoured battalion removed from the 221st Brigade, the 557th Mixed Antitank Artillery Regiment and the SAO Krajina Territorial Defence. Offensive support was provided by the 9th Mixed Artillery Regiment and the 9th Military Police Battalion. The 221st Brigade was commanded by Colonel Borislav Đukić. Elements the 46th Partisan Division, drawn from the 24th (Kragujevac) Corps, also provuded support for the corps. The JNA garrison in Šibenik barracks included the 11th Marine Infantry Brigadeone of a handful of units regularly maintained at full combat readiness.|$|E

Operation Prime Chance was a United States Special Operations Command operation intended to protect U.S.-flagged oil tankers from Iranian attack. The operation took place roughly {{at the same time}} as Operation Earnest Will, the largely Navy effort to escort the tankers through the Persian Gulf. Under international law, an attack on such ships would be treated as an attack on the U.S., allowing the U.S. to retaliate militarily.

40|$|Armoured ground crickets Acanthoplus discoidalis (Bradyporidae) have {{an arsenal}} of defence {{mechanisms}} in response to attack. Males but not females can stridulate when attacked, while both sexes will bite and regurgitate upon provocation. They will also autohaemorrhage. Here we have quantified these responses, examining how individuals of both sexes respond to repeated simulated predatory attack from the side (grabbing the legs with forceps) or from above (grabbing the animal by the pronotum). We found different responses depending on the method <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> When <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> <b>directed</b> from the side (at the legs) the crickets can bite their attacker and males stridulate intensely. About 62 % <b>of</b> such <b>attacks</b> elicited an autohaemorrhage response, where the crickets squirt 13 ± 22 mg of acrid-smelling haemolymph 43 ± 63 mm from seams in the connective tissue between the trochanter and coxa of each leg and from under the pronotum. By contrast, animals attacked from above could not turn and bite their attacker, and stridulation was also reduced in males. About 86 % <b>of</b> such <b>attacks</b> elicited an autohaemorrhage response with 19 ± 19 mg of haemolymph projecting 10 ± 30 mm from the body.

Harun al-Rashid viewed this as a rebellion and dispatched a large army headed by Ja'far ibn Yahya al-Barmaki to quell the revolt.

According to a 10th-century Christian source, one side suffered 80 dead and the other side, 60. According to Gil, al-Barmaki [...] "put down the rebels with an iron hand and much blood was spilled." [...] Al-Barmaki assigned Issa ibn al-Akki as his representative for the whole province of Bilad ash-Sham, while he appointed Salih bin Sulayman as his representative in al-Balqa. Thus, Jund al-Urdunn, which had normally been under the authority of the governor of Damascus, gained separate administration. This was a result of al-Barmaki's belief that Transjordan was the epicenter of the rebellion.|$|R

Oxfordians have even claimed that the writers of the first-hand accounts of the real wreck based them on The Tempest, or, at least, the same antiquated sources that Shakespeare, or rather Oxford, is imagined to have used exclusively, including Richard Eden's The Decades of the New Worlde Or West India (1555) and Desiderius Erasmus's Naufragium/The Shipwreck (1523).

Xenophobia {{has to do with}} contemptuous of that which is foreign, especially of strangers or of people from different countries or cultures. Unemployment and mounting poverty among South Africans {{at the bottom of the}} economic ladder have provoked fears of the competition that better educated and experienced migrants can represent. South Africa’s long track-record of violence as a means of protest and the targeting of foreigners in particular; and, the documented tensions over migration policy and the scale of repatriation serve a very good explanation for its xenophobia. It was clear that while most <b>of</b> the <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> <b>directed</b> against foreign, primarily African, migrants, that this was not the rule. <b>Attacks</b> <b>were</b> also noted against Chinese-speakers, Pakistani migrants as well as against South Africans from minority language groups (in the conflict areas). Settlements that have recently experienced the expression of ‘xenophobic’ violence have also been the site of violent and other forms of protest around other issues, most notably service delivery. The failure of government in service delivery was vexed on this form of xenophobia (HSRC, 2008). Due to the increase in migration, this conflict is certainly not temporary in nature. Xenophobia manifests in different regions and communities, with devastating effects on the affected nationals.

40|$|This slim book by the philosopher, Paul Boghossian, <b>is</b> a many-pronged <b>attack</b> on relativism and constructivism, {{especially}} social constructivism, as {{seen from}} an objectivist perspective that he attempts to justify by appeals to logic and common sense. He wishes to defend the privileged status of science against those who hold that all belief systems are ‘equally valid’. There is a wealth of interesting material. I recommend especially the criti-cism of Wittgenstein on {{the logic of the}} Azande and of Richard Rorty on the dispute between Galileo and Cardinal Bellarmine. They remind us not to be too quick to conclude that two belief systems are incommensurable. Other philosophers whose seemingly constructivist or relativist views are criticized include Nelson Goodman and Hilary Putnam on the description-dependence of facts, Thomas Kuhn on incommensurability in science, and Pierre Duhem on the underdetermination of theory by evidence. Doubts about the Success of the Project Although Boghossian seems confident that he has refuted relativism and constructivism, I don’t see that he has refuted either. Indeed, most <b>of</b> his <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> <b>directed</b> against the wrong targets. This is a predictable conse-quence of his tacit assumption that he can learn how things appear from another perspective merely by observing, from his own perspective, how they appear to appear from the other one. For example, although relativism is no less concerned with meaning than with truth, Boghossian’s relativism is almost exclusively concerned with truth. There also are serious problems with the exposition. Several important arguments employ expressions bor-rowed from ordinary language whose technical meanings, apparently invented by Boghossian, are not revealed. 1 Yet he treats {{them as if they were}} crystal clear.
