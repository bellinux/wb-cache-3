5|$|Goosebumps {{has spawned}} merchandise, {{including}} T-shirts, board games, puzzles, hats, fake skulls, dolls, bike helmets, fake blood, and boxer shorts. Goosebumps was also adapted into a stage play by Rupert Holmes in 1998 and a stage musical by John Maclay and Danny Abosch in 2016. Goosebumps has an official website, which garners 1.5 million page views each month as of 2008. An attraction {{based on the}} series, the Goosebumps HorrorLand Fright Show and FunHouse, opened in October 1997 at Disney-MGM Studios's New York Street. Before it closed, the attraction consisted of a stage play which featured characters from the series; this show played five times a day. The attraction also featured a funhouse, called the Goosebumps HorrorLand Hall <b>of</b> <b>Mirrors,</b> which contained a maze <b>of</b> <b>mirrors</b> along with other props and gags from the series. In 2008, {{it was announced that}} Sally Corporation would market Goosebumps rides.|$|E

40|$|We first give a complete, albeit brief, {{review of}} the {{discovery}} <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry in $N= 2 $ string/conformal field theory. In particular, we describe the naturality arguments {{which led to the}} initial mirror symmetry conjectures and the subsequent work which established the existence <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry through direct construction. We then review a number of striking consequences <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry [...] both conceptual and calculational. Finally, we describe recent work which introduces a variant on our original proof of the existence <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry. This work affirms classical [...] quantum symmetry duality as well as extends the domain <b>of</b> our initial <b>mirror</b> symmetry construction. Comment: 19 page...|$|R

5|$|Bronze mirrors {{arrived to}} Japan from China {{as early as}} the Yayoi period and {{continued}} to be imported through the Tang Dynasty (618–907). During that period mirrors cast in Japan were imitations of Chinese prototypes and subsequently Japanese designs were established. All of these mirrors were generally circular, with a polished front, and a back decorated with molded or engraved reliefs, sometimes inlaid with gold or silver. Three mirrors or sets <b>of</b> <b>mirrors</b> decorated with floral and animal motifs have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|During the renovation, {{walls and}} {{coverings}} were stripped away to reveal 1950s features. Drywall {{was removed from}} guest room walls to highlight the original masonry bricks. Walls partitioning the central lobby were torn down to open up Varney's intended connection between the indoor and outdoor public spaces. Concrete columns in the lobby were stripped <b>of</b> <b>mirrors</b> added by Ramada so as to show their original design.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the Moon {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent site for telescopes. It is relatively nearby; astronomical seeing is not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold, and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes {{on the far side}} would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction <b>of</b> <b>mirrors</b> up to 50 meters in diameter. A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMirror {{symmetry}} is {{ubiquitous in}} natural visual scenes, and detection <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry {{seems to be}} a global, automatic, effortless and important aspect of visual perception. The perception <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry has not been studied in humans with amblyopia. In this paper we measured and quantified the detection <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry in adults with naturally occurring amblyopia. Our results show that amblyopia may severely impair the detection <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry, and that this impairment is not simply a consequence of reduced stimulus visibility. Rather, we suggest that this loss may reflect, at least in part, a deficit in the integration of local orientation information...|$|R

5|$|The colours of glass, ceramic glazes, paints, pigments, and {{plastics}} {{are commonly}} {{produced by the}} inclusion of heavy metals (or their compounds) such as chromium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, selenium, zirconium, molybdenum, silver, tin, praseodymium, neodymium, erbium, tungsten, iridium, gold, lead, or uranium. Tattoo inks may contain heavy metals, such as chromium, cobalt, nickel, and copper.

Headlight reflectors rely on the excellent reflectivity of a thin film of rhodium.|$|E
5|$|The Hall of Ambassadors ("Sala dos Embaixadores"), {{sometimes}} called the throne room or the Hall <b>of</b> <b>Mirrors,</b> was designed by Robillon in 1757 {{and is one of}} the largest reception rooms in the palace. This long low room has a ceiling painted by Francisco de Melo which depicts the Portuguese royal family attending a concert during the reign of Queen Maria I. The room is extremely wide and light, spanning the full width of the palace, with tall windows on both sides. Between each window is a semi-circular gilt console table above which are pier glasses adorned with crystal sconces. The throne dais, set in an apse, is flanked by gilded and mirrored columns, and the floor is a chequer board pattern of black and white marble tiles.|$|E
5|$|The artwork for {{the album}} cover of Trans-Europe Express was {{originally}} {{going to be}} a monochrome picture of the group reflected in a series <b>of</b> <b>mirrors.</b> This idea was dropped for a photo by New York-based celebrity photographer Maurice Seymour, with the group dressed in suits to resemble mannequins. J. Stara's image of the group was taken in Paris and is a highly retouched photo-montage of Kraftwerk from their shoulders up again posed as mannequins which are shown {{on the cover of the}} English version of the album. On the inside sleeve, a color collage of the group sitting at a small cafe table designed by Emil Schult was used. The photo for this scene was from the session by Maurice Seymour, taken on the group's American tour. Other photos were taken by Schult that show the group laughing and smiling. These were not used for the album's release.|$|E

5|$|The current {{paper mill}} building, whose water wheel {{is powered by}} a small canal from the river, dates from around 1860 and is a Grade II listed building. The {{commercial}} production of handmade paper ceased in February 2008 after owner Gerry Cottle concluded there was no longer a market for the product, and therefore sold most of the historic machinery. Visitors to the site are still able to watch a short video of the paper being made from cotton. Other attractions include the dinosaur yard, a small museum about the cave and cave diving, a theatre with circus shows, a house <b>of</b> <b>mirrors</b> and penny arcades.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} for generating solar {{energy from the}} Sahara Desert is huge, the highest found on the globe. Professor David Faiman of Ben-Gurion University has stated that the technology now exists to supply all of the world's electricity needs from 10% of the Sahara Desert. Desertec Industrial Initiative was a consortium seeking $560 billion to invest in North African solar and wind installations over the next forty years to supply electricity to Europe via cable lines running under the Mediterranean Sea. European interest in the Sahara Desert stems from its two aspects: the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land. The Sahara receives more sunshine per acre than any part of Europe. The Sahara Desert also has the empty space totalling hundreds of square miles required to house fields <b>of</b> <b>mirrors</b> for solar plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{unification}} of Germany into a politically and administratively integrated nation state officially occurred on 18 January 1871, in the Hall <b>of</b> <b>Mirrors</b> at the Palace of Versailles in France. Princes of the German states, excluding Austria, gathered there to proclaim Wilhelm I of Prussia as German Emperor after the French capitulation in the Franco-Prussian War. Unofficially, {{the de facto}} transition {{of most of the}} German-speaking populations into a federated organization of states had been developing for some time through alliances formal and informal between princely rulers—but in fits and starts; self-interests of the various parties hampered the process over nearly a century of autocratic experimentation, beginning in the era of the Napoleonic Wars, which saw the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (1806), and the subsequent rise of German nationalism.|$|E

5|$|As in {{the rest}} of Italy, the finest and most {{decorated}} rooms were those on the piano nobile, reserved for guests and entertaining. Entered formally from the external Baroque double staircase, these rooms consisted of a suite of large and small salons, with one very large salon being the principal room of the house, often used as a ballroom. Sometimes the guest bedrooms were sited here too, {{but by the end of}} the 18th century they were more often on a secondary floor above. If decorated during the Baroque era, the rooms would be profusely ornamented. Walls were frequently mirrored, the mirrors inset into gilded frames in the walls, often alternating with paintings similarly framed, while moulded nymphs and shepherdesses decorated the spaces between. Ceilings were high and frescoed, and from the ceiling hung huge coloured chandeliers of Murano glass, while further light came from gilded sconces flanking the mirrors adorning the walls. One of the most notable rooms in this style is the Gallery <b>of</b> <b>Mirrors</b> in Palermo's Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi (Illustration 17). This room with its frescoed ceiling by Gaspare Fumagalli is, however, one of the few Baroque rooms in this Baroque palazzo, which was (from 1750) extended and transformed by its owner Marianna Valguarnera, mostly in the later neoclassical style.|$|E
5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are {{on their hands and}} knees in an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room <b>of</b> <b>mirrors,</b> with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} where mirror mode {{structures}} are generated near unmagnetized solar system bodies (Venus and comet P/Halley measured in situ by Venus Express and Giotto). To estimate the location <b>of</b> the <b>mirror</b> mode source region at Venus, we apply a turbulent diffusion model <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> mode structures, {{which has already}} been successfully tested in planetary magnetosheaths (Earth, Jupiter, Saturn). It enables us to estimate {{the distance between the}} measured location <b>of</b> the <b>mirror</b> mode and the origin <b>of</b> the <b>mirror</b> mode structure through the mirror mode size. We find that the scenario <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> mode excitation at the bow shock with subsequent convection and diffusion downstream to the magnetopause is valid for Venus. In the cometary case, however, we find that the size <b>of</b> the <b>mirror</b> mode structure is comparable to the gyroradius of water group ions. This suggests local production <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> mode structures in the cometary magnetosheath, most likely through fresh ion pickup, as opposed to the convection and diffusion mechanism at Venus...|$|R
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} scene in which Eminem stands on the rooftop of the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York, saying the {{introductory}} lyrics. The video cuts between scenes where he raps on the rooftop and another scene where Eminem is trapped inside a dark basement. Eminem moves closer towards the edge of the building until he leaves to go downstairs as the chorus begins. He starts walking down Market Street in Newark and jaywalks across the street, avoiding vehicles that pass by. Eminem sees distorted reflections of himself on the window of a car; he continues on, only to be surrounded by a series <b>of</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Confused, Eminem tries to escape, and {{towards the end of the}} second chorus, he breaks through a mirror to find himself in the middle of the street. Interspersing scenes show Eminem as he tries to break out of the basement. As the camera zooms out, the viewers see him on the edge of a destroyed street while a subway tunnel can be seen below the road.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Colombian film director Simon Brand, in Los Angeles between April 6 and April 8, 2001, and was choreographed by Dan Karaty. Shot in a set with futuristic backdrops, Simpson assumes {{the role of a}} spy on a mission in the video. It begins with Simpson exiting a helicopter then entering a building to compromise evidence in a laboratory there. Simpson takes the elevator which opens onto a pathway. While she is walking, a gadget appears on the floor followed by a small explosion. In the next scene, Simpson walks through a water tunnel, out of which she is pulled by a robotic hand. As the video progresses, Simpson is shown dancing in a room full <b>of</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Scenes of ninjas climbing up a rope hanging from top of the building are inter-cut with scenes of Simpson dancing until the laboratory explodes. Simpson is next shown dancing on the rooftop alongside the ninjas before a helicopter arrives and Simpson boards it.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} {{of the many}} rooms are the state apartments. These were laid out from the 16th century onwards, and were {{enhanced}} {{in the style of}} those at Versailles during the 18th century. In the 19th century and again during the late 20th century, large-scale restoration of the state rooms consolidated the 18th-century style which prevails today. Designed as an enfilade and a ceremonial route to the throne room, the processional route begins with an external horseshoe-shaped staircase which leads from the court of honour to the open gallery known as the Gallery of Hercules. From here guests enter the Mirror Gallery, a long hall inspired by the Hall <b>of</b> <b>Mirrors</b> at Versailles. This gallery leads to the first of the state rooms, the Officer's Room, where guests are greeted by court officials before an audience with the prince in the Throne Room. From the Officer's Hall the enfilade continues to the Blue Room. This large drawing room, decorated with blue brocade, is hung with Grimaldi family portraits and has chandeliers of Murano glass. The following room, the largest of the state apartments, is the Throne Room. Its ceiling and frescoes were executed by Orazio de Ferrari and depict the surrender of Alexander the Great. The throne, in the Empire style, is positioned on a dais, beneath a red silk canopy of estate surmounted by a gilt crown. The floors are of Carrara marble. All state ceremonies have been held in this room since the 16th century.|$|E

40|$|Background: Mirror {{therapy is}} a {{relatively}} new therapeutic modality, where movement of the unaffected limb is used to facilitate performance of the affected limb. Literature review of clinical studies regarding the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> therapy in different groups of patients was performed. The review focussed on randomised controlled trials and studies, which explore the underlying mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> therapy. Conclusions: The majority of randomised controlled trials were done in stroke patients. In these, mirror therapy improved the velocity and accuracy of the impaired upper limb movement and sensation. No significant effect was found on spasticity, gait and hand function. The effect <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> therapy on active range of motion, hand grip, function of the upper limb and reduction of pain intensity was not fully conclusive. For complex regional pain syndrome type I, mirror therapy improved hand grip and function, and reduced pain intensity and hand oedema. There is also evidence that mirror therapy reduces pain in a phantom limb. Most of the reviewed studies included small sample size. Studies on the underlying mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> therapy suggested as more likely the effect of increased forced attention and motor imagery rather than increased activation <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> neurons in healthy subjects. Probably, the underlying mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> therapy differ in patients with sensory-motor impairments compared to healthy subjects...|$|R
