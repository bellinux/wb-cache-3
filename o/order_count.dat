50|$|High {{clock rates}} impose {{additional}} design {{constraints on the}} counter: if the clock period is short, {{it is difficult to}} update the count. Binary counters, for example, need a fast carry architecture because they essentially add one to the previous counter value. A solution is using a hybrid counter architecture. A Johnson counter, for example, is a fast non-binary counter. It can be used to count very quickly the low order count; a more conventional binary counter can be used to accumulate the high <b>order</b> <b>count.</b> The fast counter is sometime called a prescaler.|$|E

30|$|Since {{the depth}} map and its {{associated}} texture video are both projections of the same scenery from the same viewpoint {{at the same time}} instant, the motion characteristics (i.e., block partitioning and corresponding motion vectors) of the depth map {{and its associated}} texture video are typically similar. Therefore, a new coding mode motion parameter inheritance (MPI) [4, 17], where the data that are already transmitted for the texture video picture can be reused for efficient encoding of the depth map, has been introduced in the 3 D-HEVC encoder. This achieves the highest coding efficiency but requires a very high computational complexity. Since the motion vectors of the texture video have quarter-sample accuracy, whereas for the depth map only full-sample accuracy is used, in the inheritance process, the motion vectors are quantized to their nearest full-sample position. In addition, the inherited reference picture shall be the one with the same picture <b>order</b> <b>count</b> (POC) and viewpoint as the reference picture of the co-located block in the texture video picture. If there is no reference picture in the reference lists that satisfies this condition, such a candidate is treated as invalid and it is not inserted to the merge candidate list. However, the coding information correlations between the depth map and texture video are not fully studied. The coding information includes the reference picture, prediction mode, and motion vector.|$|E

El-liptic and Hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems (ECC, HECC) are emerging as the best solutions for light weight cryptography. Like in any traditional cryptosystem, the size of the cipher-text space is a significant factor indicating the achievable security level. In the traditional systems, the size of the group on which the system is defined, defines the cipher-text space. Unlike the traditional ones, ECC and HECC are defined on the Jacobian of curves. Gaining knowledge {{about the size of the}} Jacobian is not straight-forward and the computation is inefficient. Since the generic group <b>order</b> <b>counting</b> methods are incapable of counting in large groups of cryptographic size (2160), special methods were devised for counting in the Jacobian of hyperelliptic curves, which are not yet fast enough for practical applications. In this thesis, we are bringing together the advances in group <b>order</b> <b>counting</b> and the special properties of genus 2 hyperelliptic curves. The Primorial method for group <b>order</b> <b>counting</b> is applied in a special interval where the group order is predicted to be. The resulting method provides an improve-ment factor of P ϕ(P), where P is the product of the first p primes and ϕ is Euler’s totient function. We will see that the value of p varies, depending on the expected size of the Jacobian. It will also be shown that the factor of improvement becomes larger when the size of the group gets larger. iii i...|$|R

We assume that a and V attain their maximal values A_ 0 > 0, V_ 0 > 0, only at ξ = 0 and x = 0.
