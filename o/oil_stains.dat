5000|$|Tools {{to detect}} {{oil and gas}} have been {{evolving}} for over a century. The simplest and most direct tool is well cuttings examination. Some older oilmen ground the cuttings between their teeth and tasted to see if crude oil was present. Today, a wellsite geologist or mudlogger uses a low powered stereoscopic microscope to determine the lithology of the formation being drilled and to estimate porosity and possible <b>oil</b> <b>staining.</b> A portable ultraviolet light chamber or [...] "Spook Box" [...] is {{used to examine the}} cuttings for fluorescence. Fluorescence can be an indication of crude <b>oil</b> <b>staining,</b> or of the presence of fluorescent minerals. They can be differentiated by placing the cuttings in a solvent filled watchglass or dimple dish. The solvent is usually carbon tetrachlorethane. Crude oil dissolves and then redeposits as a fluorescent ring when the solvent evaporates. The written strip chart recording of these examinations is called a sample log or mudlog.|$|R

The color and Totenköpfe (skulls) were chosen due to their similarity to the uniforms of August von Mackensen's Black Hussars, and also for practical reasons: the black color made <b>oil</b> <b>stains</b> less visible and a short jacket was {{less likely to get}} caught in the machinery. The trousers had tapered cuffs with drawstrings and tapes in order to fit into lace-up ankle boots.

50|$|Much of {{the uniform}} and {{equipment}} of soldiers during the First World War was quite impractical for use inside a tank. In particular, the vision apertures {{in a tank}} were so small {{that it was necessary}} to keep the eyes very close to them in order to get even a limited vision. Thus, any headdress with a peak was entirely unsuitable. In May 1918, General Elles and Colonel Fuller were discussing the future of the Tank Corps and its uniform and General Elles tried on a beret of the 70th Chasseurs Alpins, which was billeted nearby. A black beret was selected as it would not show <b>oil</b> <b>stains.</b> No change in uniform was possible during the war, but after a prolonged argument with the War Office, the black beret was approved by King George V on 5 March 1924. The black beret remained the exclusive headdress of the Royal Tank Corps until its practical value was recognised by others and its use extended to the majority of the Royal Armoured Corps in 1940. On the introduction of the blue beret in 1949, the Royal Tank Regiment reclaimed its right to the exclusive use of the black beret, which may not be worn by any other Regiment or Corps {{with the exception of the}} Berkshire and Westminster Dragoons Squadrons of The Royal Yeomanry.|$|E

5000|$|Clough's early {{subject matter}} {{led to her}} being linked with Neo-Romantic artists such as John Minton and Michael Ayrton. From the 1950s onwards, she {{increasingly}} painted the industrial landscapes of post-WWII Britain. Although based in London, she made frequent trips to East Anglia and the Midlands. During the 1950s, Clough became close friends with the painter and critic John Berger; they went drawing together in the marshalling yards at Willesden Junction. Clough also visited a number of factories and industrial sites with the sculptor Ghisha Koenig, and became close friends with the painter David Carr, who also shared her interest in the industrial landscape as a subject. These trips resulted {{in a number of}} paintings of men and women at work in factories and on building sites, together with images of power stations, electrical plants and chemical works. The novelist Margaret Drabble has noted that while many of her early paintings included the human figure, it gradually disappeared from her works, and Clough's canvases became more abstract during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1960, Clough had her first retrospective at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, under the directorship of the curator Bryan Robertson. During a 1982 interview with Robertson, which was published in the catalogue for an exhibition of Clough's work held that year at the Warwick Arts Trust, the artist described how: [...] "I prefer to look at the urban or industrial scene or any unconsidered piece of ground." [...] In the latter decades of her career, Clough made a number of abstract works that reference fragments of urban detritus and rubbish that she found on the streets of London, such as plastic bags, discarded gloves, and <b>oil</b> <b>stains.</b> The first time she exhibited these paintings was in 1989 in a show entitled Prunella Clough: Recent Paintings, 1980-1989 at Annely Juda Fine Art Gallery in London. The exhibition was a “critical and financial success” and helped Clough gain recognition and popularity. [...] The early 1980s saw Clough embark on a series of paintings that focussed on an abstracted 'gate' motif, and she also became fascinated by the shadows cast by passing people on subway walls, creating a number of works on this theme. In 1979, Clough {{played a key role in}} helping to organise the major retrospective of Eileen Gray's work at the Victoria & Albert Museum and the Museum of Modern Art, New York.|$|E

5000|$|... Barely {{seven years}} after Edwin L. Drake drilled the world's first oil well in 1859 at Titusville, Pennsylvania, USA, history {{registered}} another exploration of the black liquid gold, in the largest continent. More than a century ago, history was made in a remote corner of Assam {{in the midst of}} the dense and malaria infested jungles, by a band of intrepid pioneers searching for black gold. In 1867 Italian Engineers, commissioned by the Assam Railways and Trading Company, to build a railway line from Dibrugarh to Margherita (Headquarters of Assam Railways and Trading Company) accidentally discovered oil at Digboi around 10 miles from Margherita.‘Dig boy, dig’, shouted the English engineer, Mr W L Lake, at his men as they watched elephants emerging out of the dense forest with <b>oil</b> <b>stains</b> on their feet".This is possibly the most distilled - though fanciful - version of the legend explaining the siting and naming of Digboi. Two events separated by seven years have become fused, but although neither is likely to be provable, such evidence that does exist appears sufficiently detailed to be credible. Various web sites offer variations on the elephant’s foot story, a consensus of which would be that engineers extending the Dibru-Sadiya railway line to Ledo for the Assam Railways and Trading Company (AR&TC) in 1882 were using elephants for haulage and noticed that the mud on one pachyderm’s feet smelled of oil. Retracing the trail of footprints, they found oil seeping to the surface. One of the engineers, the Englishman Willie Leova Lake, was an ‘oil enthusiast’ and persuaded the company to drill a well. Oil India Ltd makes no reference to elephants’ feet in its company history, although on its previous web site the company noted that Lake had noticed [...] "the oil seepages around Borbhil". Once the project had been approved, Lake assembled equipment, boilers, and local labour, and engaged elephants to haul the machinery to the site. The first well was started in September 1889, but an encouraging first strike at 178 ft turned out to be a small pocket, and drilling recommenced. This continued until November 1890 when the well was completed at a total depth of 662 ft, and it was during this extended period of drilling that Oil India's old web site placed the legend of Lake exhorting one or more of his labourers to [...] "Dig, boy!" ...|$|E
