40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to point out the}} problematic accounting areas in agriculture as well as evaluating how this area is dealt with by the observed company. Two typical areas are specified ? vegetable production and livestock production. The first part of the thesis deals with possible ways of livestock production accounting in accordance with the Czech legislation. On the other hand, the outlook of international accounting standards is also outlined, seeing the animals as a biological asset with regard to their specific qualities. The practical part defines the farming business, which provided the necessary information in the areas of animal records and accounting. The attention is paid to purchasing the animals, finding out and accounting their growth, accounting their assignment to higher build categories, their writing <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>discard.</b> Another area the thesis deals with is the issue of subsidies. The theoretical part primarily outlines how different types of subsidies are accounted {{from the point of view}} of the Czech legislation as well as the international accounting standards. As far as the practical part is concerned, the subsidies used by the company are specified along with the procedure of their accounting. Furthermore, an in-house directive elaborated by request of the accounting entity is a part of this thesis. The in-house directive defines the area of stock, which the company wants to account directly into the consumption. Therefore the applicable regulations are mentioned and the essential directive is created on the pattern of in-house directives...|$|E

50|$|In zone melting, {{also called}} zone refining, the first silicon {{purification}} method to be widely used industrially, rods of {{metallurgical grade silicon}} are heated to melt at one end. Then, the heater is slowly moved {{down the length of}} the rod, keeping a small length of the rod molten as the silicon cools and re-solidifies behind it. Since most impurities tend to remain in the molten region rather than re-solidify, when the process is complete, most of the impurities in the rod will have been moved into the end that was the last to be melted. This end is then cut <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>discarded,</b> <b>and</b> the process repeated if a still higher purity is desired.|$|R

50|$|Dry beans {{will keep}} indefinitely if {{stored in a}} cool, dry place, but as time passes, their nutritive value and flavor degrade and cooking times lengthen. Dried beans are almost always cooked by boiling, often after being soaked in water for several hours. While the soaking is not {{strictly}} necessary, it shortens cooking time and results in more evenly textured beans. In addition, soaking beans removes 5 to 10% of the gas-producing sugars that can cause flatulence for some people. The methods include simple overnight soaking and the power soak method in which beans are boiled for three minutes and then set aside for 2-4 hours.

40|$|Direct chill (DC) casting {{is widely}} used to produce {{aluminium}} ingots and billets. One of the issues with such castings is the oxide generated especially during the filling of the casting table in the start-up phase. This oxide can affect {{the performance of the}} product during subsequent extrusion. While the very first material is cut <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>discarded</b> the distribution of oxides along the cast length is not known. It is therefore highly desirable to have an ability to predict the amount and distribution of the oxide generated during the process start-up. In this paper, we use the mesh-free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method to model the mould filling phase of DC casting. The free surface nature of the flow during this phase is especially amenable to the mesh-free SPH modelling technique. Additionally this method is very suitable for predicting surface driven and history dependent properties such as oxides. The paper presents preliminary predictions of cumulative interior and exterior oxide levels with time in a typical DC casting operation. The amount of interior oxide will indicate the effect of oxide on the final metal microstructure. The amount of exterior oxide determines the surface quality of the billet...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of large diameter pipe by the helical welding process requires that consecutive coils be welded together {{to facilitate the}} advance of each subsequent coil through the forming section of the pipe mill. Traditionally, the skelp ends have been joined by a single-pass submerged arc weld simply designed to join the skelp ends together and provide sufficient strength and ductility to survive the pipe forming operation. Subsequent to pipe forming, the length of pipe containing the skelp end weld (SEW) has been cut <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>discarded.</b> This process results in both a substantial yield loss as well as additional processing costs as the shortened pipes are later double jointed to produce full size lengths.

A native to the border and entering adulthood with the transition to a post-NAFTA world of globalization and import/exportation, Ruiz Otis "found" his art among the industrial trash and recycling dumpsters in the many maquiladoras scattered throughout the Tijuana border region. Taking this discarded material, Jaime Ruiz Otis turns this "trash" into works of art that highlight and explain an important geographic and cultural region. He creates minimalist installations that address the economic and cultural reality unique to border life with a twist of irony as what was once cast <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>discarded</b> is now considered symbolic, artistically significant, and strikingly beautiful. Jaime Ruiz Otis is unique in that his inspiration to use <b>discarded</b> <b>and</b> recycled materials grew from his own employment at a maquiladora along the Tijuana border.

The proposed method stores petabytes of user-data in a sugar cube (1 cm 3), and can read/write that information at hundreds of megabits/sec. Digital information is recorded and stored {{in the form of a}} long macromolecule consisting of at least two bases, A and B.

A macromolecule with, say, 10, 000 identical bases in the form of AAAAA [...] AAA may be used to record a kilobyte block of user-data (including modulation and error-correction coding), although, in this blank state, it can only represent the null sequence 00000 [...] 000. Suppose this blank string of A's is dragged before an atomically-sharp needle of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). When electric pulses are applied to the needle in accordance with the sequence of 0 s and 1 s of a 1 kB block of user-data, selected A molecules will be transformed into B molecules (e. g., a fraction of A will be broken <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>discarded).</b> The resulting string now encodes the user-data in the form of AABABBA [...] .

Approximately 50 ¬†mg bone granulate was transferred to a pre-cleaned glass vial and sealed. After weighing ca. 20 ¬†mg of sample was transferred to a centrifuge tube.

50|$|Swept {{crystals}} are crystals {{that have}} undergone a solid-state electrodiffusion purification process. Sweeping involves heating the crystal above 500 ¬∞C in a hydrogen-free atmosphere, with a voltage gradient {{of at least}} 1 kV/cm, for several hours (usually over 12). The migration of impurities and the gradual replacement of alkali metal ions with hydrogen (when swept in air) or electron holes (when swept in vacuum) causes a weak electric current through the crystal; decay of this current to a constant value signals {{the end of the}} process. The crystal is then left to cool, while the electric field is maintained. The impurities are concentrated at the cathode region of the crystal, which is cut <b>off</b> afterwards <b>and</b> <b>discarded.</b> Swept crystals have increased resistance to radiation, as the dose effects are dependent on the level of alkali metal impurities; they are suitable for use in devices exposed to ionizing radiation, e.g. for nuclear and space technology. Sweeping under vacuum at higher temperatures and higher field strengths yields yet more radiation-hard crystals. The level and character of impurities can be measured by infrared spectroscopy. Quartz can be swept in both Œ± and Œ≤ phase; sweeping in Œ≤ phase is faster, but the phase transition may induce twinning. Twinning can be mitigated by subjecting the crystal to compression stress in the X direction, or an AC or DC electric field along the X axis while the crystal cools through the phase transformation temperature region.|$|R
