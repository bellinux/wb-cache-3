5|$|A unique {{collection}} <b>of</b> <b>maps</b> {{assembled in}} the early 1570s, {{many of which are}} assembled from portions of Mercator's earlier maps: 9 constructed from Europe (1554), 6 from British Isles (1564) and 2 from the world map (1569). The map of Europe on pages 1 and 2 is taken from the 1569 world map. There are also 2 manuscript maps of Mercator and 13 maps are from the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum of Abraham Ortelius.) Note that Mercator did not term this collection <b>of</b> <b>maps</b> an atlas.|$|E

Not only did it contain maps of his journey, but also sea routes to Japan, Siberia's Kamchatka Peninsula, the Bering Strait and even to the coastlines of Alaska, centuries before the rediscovery of the Americas by Europeans.|$|E

5|$|A second {{collection}} of 23 modern maps: 16 of Italy (including Corsica), 3 of Styria {{and the other}} Balkan countries, 4 of Greece. (Once again Mercator did not term this collection <b>of</b> <b>maps</b> as an atlas but in the preface he introduces Atlas as a mythical King of Mauretania—a learned philosopher, mathematician and astronomer, credited with {{the making of the}} first globe.) This collection has a dedication to Prince Ferdinando de' Medici to whom Mercator attributes ancestry from King Atlas.|$|E
5|$|Al-Biruni (973–1048) {{measured}} the {{radius of the}} earth using a new method. It involved observing {{the height of a}} mountain at Nandana (now in Pakistan). Al-Idrisi (1100–1166) created a map of the world for Roger, the Norman King of Sicily. He also wrote the Book of Roger, a geographic study of the peoples, climates, resources and industries of the whole of the world known at that time. The Ottoman admiral Piri Reis (c. 1470–1553) made a map of the New World and West Africa in 1513. He made use <b>of</b> <b>maps</b> from Greece, Portugal, Muslim sources, and perhaps one made by Christopher Columbus. He was part of a major tradition of Ottoman cartography.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to observe the effects of gas composition in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on the shelf-life of Longissimus dorsi of Korean Native Black Pigs-Duroc Crossbred (KNP×D) during refrigerated storage. Muscle sample was obtained from the left side of carcass of seven months old of KNP×D barrow. The sample was sliced into 1 cm in thickness, placed on trays (two slices/tray) and filled with different gas composition, i. e. 0 : 20 : 80 /O 2 :CO 2 :N 2 (MAP 1), 30 : 20 : 50 /O 2 :CO 2 :N 2 (MAP 2) and 70 : 20 : 10 /O 2 :CO 2 :N 2 (MAP 3). Other slices of sample were vacuum packed (VP) as a control. All packs were stored at 5 ± 1 °C. At 12 d of storage, pH value <b>of</b> <b>MAP</b> 2 and MAP 3 were higher (p< 0. 05) than that <b>of</b> <b>MAP</b> 1 and pH value <b>of</b> <b>MAP</b> 1 was higher (p< 0. 05) than that of VP. At 6 d of storage, redness (a*) value <b>of</b> <b>MAP</b> 2 and MAP 3 were higher (p< 0. 05) than that <b>of</b> VP and <b>MAP</b> 1 and, at 9 and 12 d of storage, redness value <b>of</b> <b>MAP</b> 3 was higher (p< 0. 05) than that <b>of</b> VP, <b>MAP</b> 1, and MAP 2. At 3, 6, 9, and 12 d of storage, the 2 -thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) value <b>of</b> <b>MAP</b> 3 was higher than that <b>of</b> <b>MAP</b> 2 and TBARS value <b>of</b> <b>MAP</b> 2 was higher than that <b>of</b> VP and <b>MAP</b> 1. At 3, 6, 9, and 12 d of storage, volatile basic nitrogen values <b>of</b> <b>MAP</b> 2 and MAP 3 were higher (p< 0. 05) than those <b>of</b> VP and <b>MAP</b> 1. At 3 d of storage, total aerobic plate counts <b>of</b> <b>MAP</b> 2 and MAP 3 were higher (p< 0. 05) than those <b>of</b> VP and <b>MAP</b> 1 and, at 6 d of storage, total aerobic plate counts <b>of</b> <b>MAP</b> 3 was higher (p< 0. 05) than that <b>of</b> <b>MAP</b> 1 and MAP 2. However, there was no significant different total aerobic plate count among MAP 1, MAP 2, and MAP 3 at 9 and 12 d of storage. There was no significant different total anaerobic plate count among MAP 1, MAP 2, and MAP 3 during storage. It is concluded that the MAP containing 30 : 20 : 50 /O 2 :CO 2 :N 2 gas composition (MAP 2) might be ideal for better meat quality for KNP×D meat...|$|R

5|$|From 21 June, the 2/12th Commando Squadron {{conducted}} patrols of {{the outlying}} areas of Labuan to clear them of any Japanese forces; {{up to this}} point the squadron had formed part of the 9th Division's reserve. Each troop of the squadron was assigned a different sector of Labuan, and by mid-July had completed its task. During these patrols the squadron killed 27 Japanese soldiers, mainly as part of repelling a raid on the BBCAU compound on 24 June, and captured a single prisoner. The 2/12th Commando Squadron was subsequently directed to undertake topographic work in order to improve the quality <b>of</b> <b>maps</b> of the island. The 24th Brigade's total combat casualties in its operations on Labuan were 34 killed and 93 wounded. The Australian soldiers counted 389 Japanese dead and took 11 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Gerlachovský štít was {{not always}} {{considered}} the highest mountain in the Tatras. After the first official measurement of peaks in the Tatras {{during the period of}} the Habsburg Monarchy in the 18th century, Kriváň (2,494m) was considered the highest. Other candidate peaks for the status of the highest mountain at that time were Lomnický štít (2,633m) and Ľadový štít (2,627m). The first person to accurately name Gerlachovský štít as the highest peak was the forester Ľudovít (Ludwig) Greiner in 1838. Greiner's measurement was formally confirmed by an Austrian Army survey party in 1868. However, it was generally accepted only after the Vienna Military Institute for Geography issued a new, authoritative collection <b>of</b> <b>maps</b> of Central Europe in ca. 1875.|$|E

5|$|James Croll (1821–90) {{developed}} {{a theory of}} climate change based on changes in the Earth's orbit. Born near Perth, he was self-educated and his interest in science led to his becoming appointed as a janitor in the museum at the Andersonian College and Museum, Glasgow in 1859. His 1864 paper On the Physical Cause of the Changes of Climate during Glacial Epochs led to {{a position in the}} Edinburgh office of the Geological Survey of Scotland, as keeper <b>of</b> <b>maps</b> and correspondence, where Sir Archibald Geikie, encouraged his research. He was eventually to become a Fellow of the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|Mercator {{now turned}} to the modern maps, as author but no longer engraver: the practicalities of {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>maps</b> and globes had been passed to his sons and grandsons. In 1585 he issued a collection of 51 maps covering France, the Low Countries and Germany. Other maps may have followed in good order had not the misfortunes of life intervened: his wife Barbara died in 1586 and his eldest son Arnold died the following year so that only Rumold and the sons of Arnold were left to carry forward his business. In addition, {{the time he had}} available for cartography was reduced by a burst of writing on philosophy and theology: a substantial written work on the Harmonisation of the Gospels as well as commentaries on the epistle of St. Paul and the book of Ezekiel.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{north to}} Auckland, Heaphy's {{new role as}} the chief {{draughtsman}} for the Auckland Survey Office, kept him occupied with the preparation <b>of</b> <b>maps</b> and plans. After a few years, he began to spend a greater {{amount of time in}} the field, where he carried out survey work. As he had done when living in Nelson, he supplemented his income with commissioned artworks. He began to build on his geological knowledge, taking a particular interest in vulcanology and wrote an article on Auckland's volcanoes for a geological journal in England. He completed several paintings of volcanoes as well as thermal attractions in the Bay of Plenty including the famous Pink and White Terraces. Hoping to raise his profile, he sent many of his works to London and some remain on display at the offices of the Geological Society.|$|E

This collection <b>of</b> <b>maps</b> is dedicated to Queen Elizabeth of England and in the preface Mercator acknowledges the information he received from English mariners through Rumold who {{had spent much of}} his working life in London. The full atlas included all the maps of the previous two collections, making in all 102 new maps by Mercator. His heirs added 5 introductory maps before publication: world map and Europe by Rumold, Africa and Asia by grandson Gerard and America by grandson Michael. Nevertheless the atlas was incomplete: Spain was omitted and there were no detailed maps outside Europe. The maps are in a variety of projections.|$|E
