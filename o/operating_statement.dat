40|$|This unit is {{designed}} to provide you with an understanding of the use of management accounting information within a business organisation. You will develop abilities and learn the financial techniques used to assist decision making in relation to costing, budgeting, pricing and investments. Specifically, you will learn how to prepare an <b>operating</b> <b>statement</b> to cost a product, process or service. You will also consider the use of alternative costing methodologies (full/absorption versus marginal) within the decision-making processes of organisations. In addition you will learn how to compare budgeted activity with actual activity and analyse the resultant variances. Finally, the unit will consider capital investment projects and the basic techniques used to estimate potential returns. There are four outcomes within this unit. Each outcome {{is designed}} to provide you with essential knowledge and understanding regarding a specific area of management accounting. Outcome 1 : You will be provided with skills and develop abilities in the preparation of an <b>operating</b> <b>statement.</b> You will be shown initially how to classify costs between direct and indirect costs, and between variable and fixed costs. Secondly, you will be shown techniques to allocate and absorb overheads to the operating activities of an organisation. Thirdly, techniques associated with the determination of profit (using mark-up and margin) will be shown. These areas will be collated to provide you with sufficient knowledge and understanding to produce an <b>operating</b> <b>statement</b> for an organisation. Outcome 2 : The focus is on the development of an understanding of marginal costing and its application in relation to the provision of relevant data to inform short-term decision making. A comparison of different costing methodologies (full/absorption versus marginal) will be made. You will be encouraged to calculate the effect of changing costs and revenue levels (associated with alternative courses of action) on total contribution. You will also be shown how to calculate break-even point and the number of units required to achieve the desired level of profit. Outcome 3 : You will be shown how to construct the functional budgets of an organisation, although this will not be formally assessed. This understanding will assist you to develop skills and abilities in the comparison of budgeted activity with actual activity. You will be shown how to construct a flexed budget and to determine the resultant variances as well as the possible causes of the variances. It would be useful if a suitable spreadsheet package were used to aid calculation of the variances, although you will be shown the mechanics involved in calculating the appropriate variances. Outcome 4 : You will develop skills and abilities in the application of investment appraisal techniques (both traditional and discounted cash flow) as an aid to longerterm decision making. This will include an examination of the effects of limited funds on selecting projects as well as the normal appraisal techniques. Once again, the use of a suitable spreadsheet package would be a useful tool to aid calculation of the net present value factors. The effects of taxation will be excluded from the analysis. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{longitudinal}} study of the levels of compliance {{for the first four}} years (1994 to 1997) following the introduction of the Australian Accounting Standard (AAS 27). The annual reports of all 177 local government councils in NSW were analysed revealing a high level of compliance with the standard. The main cause for non-compliance was the complexity of the recognition and treatment of assets. In addition a number of problems were identified, in particular the timeliness of the reports and the disproportionately high levels of depreciation expenses reported in the <b>operating</b> <b>statement.</b> The increased complexities of the financial management in Local Government imposed by AAS 27 required professional accounting competencies more appropriately derived from a degree level education which contributed to a high turnover of accounting staff during the four years.

Given that a longstanding concern of the literature has been on whether these kinds of assets should be included in governmental balance sheets and <b>operating</b> <b>statements</b> at all, it is striking how often the question was settled in practice by excluding art and heritage assets, even when this meant non-compliance with national norms.

40|$|This paper aims {{to explain}} how internationally {{accepted}} accounting standards are currently applied in the budget statement treatment of the national broadband network (NBN) and how future NBN related transactions {{are likely to be}} treated under those standards. Recent media commentary and political debate has concerned the validity of the current accounting treatment of the NBN in the federal government budget statements. This background note (BN) also aims to clarify some of the terms and arguments commonly used during commentary on this topic. For example, the terms on-budget and off-budget, and the notion that the accounting treatment of the NBN is dependent on the rate of return realised by the NBN, are discussed in the section below. The body of the note then examines the accounting treatment of past and potential future NBN related transactions, given three assumed stages of NBN activity. Finally, this BN looks at whether the NBN can be accounted for as an expense item in the budget <b>operating</b> <b>statement</b> and then presents the methodology used to value the government’s equity investment in NBN Company (NBN Co) ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that performance measurement in the Public Sector {{is a difficult}} task, either in terms of efficiency or in terms of effectiveness. The most important reason for this relates {{to the lack of}} objective measures, given the market-aside operation of governmental activities. Therefore traditional methods of performance measurement, such as those based on the <b>operating</b> <b>statement</b> and the net income, tend fail. It is typical that public bodies’ outputs are multiple and qualitative and consequently do not have the physical characteristic of being countable or divisible. Portuguese Local Government has, in the last decade, undergone considerable management changes under the flag of efficiency improvement, namely additional competencies, supplementary and more diverse financial resources and a new accounting system. In this context, this paper assesses the efficiency of Portuguese Continental municipalities, using year 2004 data and following a data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology in order to provide a relative efficiency indicator. The analysis compares the ratio between resources as inputs (“undertaken commitments”) and the activities accomplished as outputs, considering the functional classification used in municipalities’ accounting and financial system. This research adds to the knowledge of local authorities’ performance the possibility of establishing a functioning ranking, nowadays increasingly important in what concerns financing issues. The preliminary results show that larger municipalities tend to be more efficient. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a high demand for the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems among small to medium to sized {{companies}} in Malaysia. Due to the rapidly changing business environment, many organisations require the ERP system to integrate information from all departments and to support business activities. ERP is a necessity for every business to remain sustainable and competitive in the industry. The main objective of the study is to discover the relationship between ERP user training and ERP system usage in management accounting activities. The management accounting activities here refer to Capital Budgeting, Budgeting, Activity Based Costing, <b>Operating</b> <b>Statement</b> and Reporting and Forecasting. In addition, the second objective of the study relates to examining the relationship between ERP user training and company performance. Data was collected by means of online questionnaire in order to evaluate how training on ERP has made an impact on the usage of ERP system in the five management accounting functions and company performance. In general, the results indicate that ERP user training and the usage of ERP has enhanced the quality of management accounting practices. However, there was no indication to show that there was a significant relationship between ERP user training and company performance. Therefore, it can also be concluded that ERP system has an impact on the above mentioned management accounting practices. It is hoped that {{the findings of this study}} will offer substantial benefits to management accountants in performing their roles and responsibilities, contribute to the emerging list of literature on ERP systems and potential impact on management accounting education and research, and also to serve as an advantage to IT systems consulting companies in their effort to promote an effective ERP system user training...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how senior accounting staff in Victorian local authorities are recording and reporting infrastructure assets (IAs) with their relevant depreciation in General Purpose Financial Reports (GPFRs) and the decisions made from this information. IAs are long-lived assets such as roads, drains and bridges. The introduction of Australian Accounting Standard No. 27 Financial Reporting by Local Governments (AAS 27), which applies to all Australian local authorities require IAs to be reported in the balance sheet and depreciation to be charged in the <b>operating</b> <b>statement</b> in order to reflect the loss of service potential in the operating period concerned. Before AAS 27, the purpose of public sector accounting was to demonstrate that funds have been raised and expended strictly within the authority of the annual budget on a cash basis. The efficiency and effectiveness of decision-making by users of this cash-based information was impaired with this short-term charge/discharge objective. The study was carried out to determine if information provided in an accrual accounting environment would be more efficient and effective for decision making by users than cash-based information. Design/methodology/approach – The study included a comprehensive literature review then interviews with 15 chief financial officers from Victorian local authorities. These authorities represented inner metropolitan, outer metropolitan, rural city, large rural and small councils. Findings – The study reported the implications for change to accrual accounting method in accounting for IAs and the efficiency and effectiveness for decision making by both internal and external users. The question answered is whether the information provided by accrual accounting is used in the management of IAs. In some areas, it has been used and the benefits show from both an efficiency and effectiveness perspective. Concerns with this issue were identified by academics, parliamentary inquires, accounting authorities and local government interest groups. Originality/value – This study is a comprehensive review of how senior local government accounting management are using the information generated from AAS 27 on IAs and what value it has in their decision making.

40|$|Using {{a unique}} dataset of {{building}} <b>operating</b> <b>statements</b> from Fannie Mae, we develop repeated measures regression (RMR) indices for NOI, EGI and PGI {{to track the}} cash flow performance of Fannie Mae-financed multifamily real estate. Our three-stage RMR estimate shows an average NOI growth of about 1. 8 % during 1993 – 2011, which is lower than inflation rate and significantly lower than what is usually perceived by investors. Based on the RMR estimates, {{we find that the}} whole portfolio of Fannie Mae multifamily properties outperforms NCREIF multifamily properties in NOI growth, especially during the 2000 – 2001 recession and the Great Recession, which helps explain the superior performance of Fannie Mae multifamily mortgage loans during the recent crisis. In the cross section, multifamily properties in supply-constrained areas have substantially larger NOI growth. Workforce housing performs better than low-income housing even after we control for locational differences and property features. We do not find a size effect in NOI growth once we control for supply constraints. We also find EGI growth to be much less volatile than NOI growth, which implies that changes in operating expenses are the main driving factor of the cyclicality of NOI. Operating expenses also tend to be pro-cyclical – they grow faster during recessions. EGI growth (decline) leads PGI growth (decline), which supports the stock-flow model of rental adjustment where vacancy changes before rent. From a methodological perspective, we find that the conventional methods such as simple average and weighted average over-estimate multifamily NOI growth, likely due to significant sample selection bias and outlier influence. In contrast, the RMR indices control for changes in property quality and are much more robust in the presence of data errors and outliers...|$|R

40|$|Hoteliers’ {{efforts to}} improve the {{environmental}} sustainability of their operations would be promoted by having a consistent industry-wide measure for benchmarking current operations and tracking the effect of environmental sustainability initiatives. This type of measure can also assist external stakeholders, such as the hotel guests and regulatory entities, to gauge hotels’ environmental sustainability efforts. This report presents the results of an exploratory study that develops such a measure, using resource consumption records of 984 U. S. hotels over a period of eight years. The measure is based on an analysis of resource consumption–related expenses found in these hotels’ year-end <b>operating</b> <b>statements,</b> for electricity, water and sewer, maintenance other expenses, and laundry, linen, and supplies for both the rooms and for food and beverage services. Using a multivariate data analysis technique called exploratory factor analysis, the measure developed in the study consists of two parts: an operating factor that comprises large weights from electricity, water and sewer, and maintenance expenses, and a behavioral factor, which is largely driven by laundry, linen, and supplies for both rooms and F 2 ̆ 6 B operations. In general, costs found in the operating factor are under management control, but the costs in the behavioral factor are subject to guests’ activities. By normalizing the average of each of these two factors at zero, hotels that score above zero on each factor are spending more than other hotels, and those with a score below zero are more efficient than others. These factors can be compared according to various hotel characteristics, such as chain segment, the involvement of a third-party professional management company in the operating structure, location (both in terms of the degree of urbanization and climate zone), and whether the hotel offers F 2 ̆ 6 B service. For instance, the above-average costs of providing F 2 ̆ 6 B are clearly depicted in these measurements (as compared with limited-service operations) ...|$|R
