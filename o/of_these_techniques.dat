5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>techniques,</b> {{particularly}} paraphrase and parody, became standardized {{during the}} first half of the 16th century; Josquin was very much a pioneer, and what was perceived by later observers as the mixing <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>techniques</b> was actually the process by which they were created.|$|E
5|$|Behavioural {{interventions}} {{attempt to}} identify and reduce the antecedents and consequences of problem behaviours. This approach has not shown success in improving overall functioning, but can help to reduce some specific problem behaviours, such as incontinence. There {{is a lack of}} high quality data on the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>techniques</b> in other behaviour problems such as wandering.|$|E
5|$|Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} to purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>techniques</b> in recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant DNA is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can be transformed into organisms in the form of plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector. The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} are {{a sample of}} the basic or widely practiced throws and pins. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>techniques</b> derive from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but some others were invented by Morihei Ueshiba. The precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles, so what follows are the terms used by the Aikikai Foundation. Note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed, they are not universally taught in numeric order.|$|E
5|$|Crash has {{the ability}} to jump into the air and land on an enemy character, spin in a tornado-like fashion to knock enemies off-screen, slide across the ground, and perform a body slam to break certain objects. Crash can jump higher than he {{normally}} can if he jumps immediately following a slide. All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>techniques</b> can be used as offensive measures against most enemies, whom serve to deter Crash's progress. Enemies with deadly topsides cannot be jumped on, while enemies that attack from the front or have side spikes must be jumped on or undergo a body slam. Enemies with sharp necklines (such as frill-necked lizards or long-legged robots with heated circumferences) can only be defeated if Crash slides into them.|$|E
5|$|Scientists and conservationists (most {{importantly}} BirdLife International {{and their}} partners, {{who run the}} Save the Albatross campaign) are working with governments and fishermen to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face. Techniques such as setting longline bait at night, dyeing the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird bycatch. For example, a collaborative study between scientists and fishermen in New Zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for longliners which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable albatross species. The use of some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>techniques</b> in the Patagonian toothfish fishery in the Falkland Islands is thought to have reduced the number of black-browed albatross taken by the fleet in the last 10 years. Conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration, removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife, which protects albatrosses from introduced predators.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, {{improved}} technology and more training and cross-training {{within the industry}} made all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>techniques</b> easier to use, so that directors of individual episodes could make decisions to use one or more methods, so such artistic choices no longer needed to be baked into the series concept.|$|E
25|$|The optimization, {{sometimes}} performed automatically by an optimizing compiler, is {{to select}} a method (algorithm) that is more computationally efficient, while retaining the same functionality.
