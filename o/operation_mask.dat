[...] Some messages were addressed to code names, while others were signed by Pollitt himself. In his transmissions to Moscow, Pollitt regularly pleaded for more funding from the Soviet Union. One 1936 coded instruction advised Pollitt to publicise the plight of Ernst Thälmann, a German communist leader who had been arrested by the Nazis and who later died at Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Pollitt replied that he was 'having difficulties' getting English statesmen to make public declarations supporting Thälmann but that they promised they would speak privately with German officials in London. In one of the more amusing dispatches, Pollitt (1936) informed his Soviet contact about a recent visit to France to make campaign appearances for candidates from the French Communist Party. [...] "At great inconvenience went to Paris to speak in the election campaign". Pollitt went on to complain that he was [...] "kept sitting two days and comrades refused to allow me to speak.

In the medical image scenario, lossy compression schemes are not generally used. This {{is due to a}} possible loss of useful clinical information which may influence diagnosis.

We propose a new Shape Adaptive Integer Wavelet Transform (SAIWT) based progressive transmission coding scheme for 2 -D and 3 -D brain MRI. The scheme consists of: (a) Extraction of shape information (<b>mask)</b> by morphological <b>operations.</b> <b>Mask</b> is a binary image with 1 ’s on the foregroung and 0 ’s in the background.

Current multimedia instruction sets use short vectors with SIMD implementations, but long vector, pipelined implementations {{have a number of}} advantages and are a logical next step in multimedia ISA development. Support for conditional operations (as occur in loops containing IF statements) is an important aspect of a vector ISA. Seven ISA alternatives for implementing conditional operations are systematically explored. Performance considerations are discussed through evaluation of a typical IF loop over a range of vector lengths and true conditional values. An approach using <b>masked</b> <b>operations</b> is shown {{to be one of the}} better methods, especially if its implementation is able to skip over blocks of false mask bits.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel face detection algorithm. Face Detection {{is the process}} of locating faces in the image. Our aim is to locate all faces in the image irrespective of various challenges usually faced by researchers. Image including faces is the further key to intelligent vision-based human computer interaction & research attempts in face processing including face recognition, face motion tracking, pose estimation, and feature recognition. Various approaches have been employed to detect faces in images. There are various challenges associated with the different techniques. The challenges usually accustomed by researchers are the facial gestures, texture, pose and lighting conditions while taking an image. Procedure used by us does not impinge on the cited challenges. The technique used for identifying the face in an image includes skin colour segmentation to reject the non-skin region, removal of noise and clutters in the segmented image through a series of morphological <b>operations,</b> <b>masking</b> the morphological operated image over the gray scale image, rejection of non-face region like hands, arms, etc based on geometry and Euler number, convolving our last output image with the templates to get final gray image containing only faces. Skin colour segmentation is done by plotting the histogram of HSV colour image and thus separating the skin region from the image. Non-face skin region is then rejected by convolving the morphological output with the templates that are representatives of human faces. Various efficient face detection techniques uses neural network scanning of test image and executes exhaustive search in every part of the image, so increases the search time and complexity. With this technique we have overcome the challenge faced by the previous techniques, i. e. time factor. I...|$|R
