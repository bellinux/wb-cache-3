40|$|The pink prawn (F. paulensis) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} fishery resources in SE/S Brazil and overexploitation has led to stock collapse in 90 ’s. The aim of this investigation was to apply histological techniques and gonadsomatic index (GSI) to validate macroscopic classification of ovaries from Farfantepenaeus paulensis, in attempt to provide a practical color standard to define maturity levels and biological information to properly manage this <b>overexploited</b> <b>stock.</b> Histological sections and GSI were used to validate macroscopic classification of ovaries. Four different development stages were suggested (immature, developing, ripe and spent). Mature oocytes present cortical rods and spent ovaries were characterized by atretic oocytes. Size frequency of oocytes were analyzed and polymodal distribution was observed, suggesting partial spawning in the wild. This investigation provided a practical scale to classify ovaries of F. paulensis as well as base information related to reproduction dynamics for this species...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic factor {{analysis}} (DFA) {{was applied to}} six time-series of catch per unit effort data of the Iberian (ICES Divisions VIIIc and IXa) white anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) and black anglerfish (L. budegassa). Results showed that grouping the abundance indices reflected the fleet’s area of exploitation and fish size selection. Two common trends (CTs) were extracted for each species, capturing the main signal of abundance over time. The white anglerfish was assessed using these CTs as input to the biomass dynamic model currently used in the ICES assessment, to investigate whether the approach would reduce the uncertainty in parameter estimates and related quantities. Using the CTs, bias estimates are lower. The current perception of an <b>overexploited</b> <b>stock</b> is unchanged, but a much lower intrinsic rate of biomass increase was estimated, indicating that the biomass recovery might be much slower. A lower maximum sustainable yield, 3600 t, was obtained, and this is more consistent with the historical landings trajectory. The application of DFA to stock assessment of anglerfish, presented {{here for the first}} time, can be extended to age-based assessments...|$|E
40|$|Gillnet mesh {{selectivity}} {{parameters for}} the sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) were estimated from catches taken by an experimental net of six panels of mesh, varying {{in size from}} 10. 2 to 25. 4 cm. The length selectivity of each mesh size was described by five different models. According to model deviance values, the four models based on the SELECT method of estimation provided better fits to the data than the gamma model previously applied to sharks. Lengths at maximum selectivity were estimated to be between 5. 3 and 7. 0 x stretched mesh size. The breadth of the selectivity curves was greater than have been reported for most species of shark. Lognormal and normal curve forms yielded the lowest model deviance and were judged {{to provide the best}} fits to the data. Peak selectivity of the commercially utilized mesh sizes was generally estimated to be greater than the observed modal length class of the commercial C. plumbeus catch. This suggests that a relatively high abundance of smaller sharks in the study area offsets gear selectivity effects in determining the size composition of commercial catches. These results have important implications for the recovery of this <b>overexploited</b> <b>stock</b> and also for managing international gillnet fisheries for the species...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, fishery {{managers}} {{strive to}} maintain fish stocks {{at or above}} levels that produce maximum sustainable yields, and to rebuild <b>overexploited</b> <b>stocks</b> that can no longer support such yields. In the United States, rebuilding <b>overexploited</b> <b>stocks</b> is a contentious issue, where most stocks are mandated to rebuild in as short a time as possible, and in a time period not to exceed 10 years. Opponents of such mandates and related guidance argue that rebuilding requirements are arbitrary, and create discontinuities in the time and fishing effort allowed for stocks to rebuild {{due to differences in}} productivity. Proponents, however, highlight how these mandates and guidance were needed to curtail the continued overexploitation of these stocks by setting firm deadlines on rebuilding. Here we evaluate the statements made by opponents and proponents of the 10 -year rebuilding mandate and related guidance to determine whether such points are technically accurate using a simple population dynamics model and a database of U. S. fish stocks to parameterize the model. We also offer solutions to many of the issues surrounding this mandate and its implementation by recommending some fishing mortality based frameworks, which meet the intent of the 10 -year rebuilding requirement while also providing more flexibility...|$|R

For this reason, {{it is almost impossible}} to reach them simultaneously. Andalusian regional government collaborates with the national government to establish fishing plans for local fisheries. The objectives of these plans verify the aforementioned statement. For instance, two contradictory objectives could be the employment preservation and the recovery of <b>overexploited</b> <b>stocks.</b> In this paper, various multi-objective programming (MOP) techniques have been applied to two fisheries: the striped venus (Chamellea gallina) fishery in the South-Atlantic Spanish region and the Strait of Gibraltar red bream (Pagellus bogaraveo) fishery of Spain.

40|$|The world’s marine {{fisheries}} {{are characterized}} by declining global catch, {{an increasing number of}} <b>overexploited</b> <b>stocks</b> and high natural variability in fish stocks. Policy makers are becoming more aware that effective management systems have to be implemented to rebuild <b>overexploited</b> fish <b>stocks.</b> The success of a management system is specified in terms of biological, economic, social and political objectives of policy makers and the fishing industry. However, the combination of these objectives makes the implementation of policies one of the main challenges in fisheries management. To prevent overfishing, different measures have been applied that limit catch and/or fleet capacity. Yet, the same management systems and economic behavior of fishermen may lead to an increase in investments in the fleet capacity, causing overcapacity. Decisions of policy makers and fishermen are made under uncertainty, such as uncertainty about fish stock dynamics and/or fish prices, and this can affect optimal management, investment decisions, healthy and productive fish stocks and resource rents. The objective of this thesis is to study the impact of different fisheries management systems on resource rents from the fishery, investment in the fleet capacity and fish stock under uncertainty about fish stock growth and the ex-vessel price of fish. Bi-level stochastic dynamic programming is used to model the interaction between the quota decision of a policy maker and fishermen behavior. The fisheries management systems of multiannual quota and a quota adjustment restriction are introduced and analyzed in terms of resource rents, overcapacity and fish stock. Real Options theory is used to determine for a fisheries management system of limited entry at what ex-vessel prices it is optimal for fishermen to make investment and disinvestment decisions...|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} {{of a stock}} after severe exploitation is of major interest to fish ecologists and managers alike. Understanding the dynamics of recruitment at low stock sizes {{is crucial to the}} simulation of stocks as they recover. Compensation in recruitment has occurred in North Sea herring, and it was stronger {{after the collapse of the}} stock. The compensation appears to be a product of both increased production of larvae per spawner and increased survival to the juvenile stage. There is only slight evidence for depensation and the point at which North Sea herring has zero recruitment appears close to the origin. There is more variability in recruits per unit spawning stock size when the stock is smaller, this is probably as a result of the potential larger diversity in contributions from spawning components in an unexploited stock compared to an <b>overexploited</b> <b>stock.</b> Mimicking this dynamic in population models will increase the uncertainties in a projection of stock recovery. The lack of observations at higher stock sizes hinders our ability to compare the dynamics of recruit to SSB across the full range of stock sizes, however, recent apparent over-compensation at higher spawning biomass has resulted in less than one recruit per mature adult being produced per year...|$|E

The length of the rehabilitation period was affected by (1 I the {{demographic characteristics of the}} stock, (2) the historical level o i exploitation, and (3) the form of the objective function. When a target stock biomass or spawning stock was specified. rehabilitation was relatively rapid due to the sharp initial reduction in fishing effort. Fishing began earlier in the planning horizon when a target harvest was specified; however, stocks recovered more slowly and fishing eifort and harvest did not stabilize at the desired levels as rapidly. Policies for maximizing harvest did not usually result in closure of the fishery; however, fishing effort usually exceeded the desired level and sometimes fluctuated considerably from year to year. Our results should aid in the development of rehabilitation policies tailored to specific fisheries or specific management goals.

40|$|The use {{of closed}} areas (marine {{protected}} areas, marine reserves, no-take zones) {{has been suggested}} as a possible solution to the perceived global fisheries crisis. However, to optimize the design and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} closed areas, we need to understand the interaction between larval dispersal, adult mobility, and fishing mortality. In this paper, a simple, spatially explicit dynamic population model was developed {{to examine the effects of}} these interacting factors on optimal closure size and resulting yields. The effect of using one large or several smaller closed areas was also examined. Our model confirmed previous results: closed areas do not improve the yield of populations that are optimally managed or underexploited and, as mobility increases, optimum closure size increases. The model also predicted some interesting counter-intuitive results; for <b>overexploited</b> <b>stocks,</b> the greatest benefit from closed areas can be obtained for stocks with highest mobility, although this may require closure of 85 % of the total area. For the tested parameter settings, adult spillover had greater potential to improve yield than larval export, and using several small closed areas rather than a single larger one had the same effect as increasing the mobility of the population. © 2008 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

As marine ecosystems degrade, so do the well-being and livelihoods of humans that depend directly on the ecosystem goods and services they provide. Marine protected areas have been proposed to protect biodiversity, restore damaged ecosystems, sustain fisheries, and rebuild <b>overexploited</b> <b>stocks.</b> The effectiveness of marine protected areas depends in part on their effectiveness as connected networks, linked over large areas by ecological processes such as larval dispersal. Here, we applied a biophysical model driven by ocean currents derived from satellite altimetry to evaluate connectivity between Western Indian Ocean reefs.

Our results show high interconnectivity within several regions (Mozambique Channel, Mascarene archipelago) and lower connectivity across the WIO region. We compared the results with the current MPA network, and proposed sites/reefs that should be considered priority sites for MPA implementation: Pebane, Cosmoledo, Majunga, Masoarivo, Platte Island, Farquhar, Agalega and Geyser bank.

MRs provide an interesting experimental treatment where humans are excluded from resource harvesting. In the absence of exploitation, marine species have been observed to return to levels of abundance similar to historic accounts of virgin biomass (biomass under an exploitation level of 0). This thesis investigates the impact and potential of MRs in both New Zealand and Chile for achieving conservation and fishery management goals through the use of underwater observation, historic information, fishers’ ecological knowledge (FEK), bioeconomic fishery modeling and ecosystem modeling [...] . Overall, this thesis has investigated the effects of human coastal resource use in New Zealand and Chile from social, economic and ecological perspectives through the use of different techniques by synthesising both quantitative and qualitative information sources.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} increase {{on the stock}} of the deep-sea pink shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) was analysed along the western coasts of Italy (North Tyrrhenian–Ligurian Sea: Geographical Sub-Area 9). This crustacean is currently {{one of the most}} important commercial species of the trawl fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea. Landings of the species in the North Tyrrhenian–Ligurian Sea have grown consistently during the last years following a rapid increase in the stock size. Since the deep-sea pink shrimp stock is exploited on the same fishing ground of other heavily <b>overexploited</b> <b>stocks</b> in a full mixed and poorly selective fishery, its condition seems to be largely independent of the current fishing exploitation pattern suggesting a positive role of climate change on the dynamic of the stock. To test this hypothesis we investigated the effect of sea surface temperature (SST) on density and distribution of P. longirostris by means of general additive models (GAMs). Two different models were developed for the whole stock and for the recruits (CL < 20 mm) using time series of MEDITS (International bottom trawl survey in the Mediterranean) survey density indices (n km− 2) covering the period 1995 – 2010.

40|$|Fish—including finfish and shellfish—are an {{important}} {{item in the}} human food basket, contributing 17 percent of the global animal-based protein supply in 2010. They are an especially valuable food source in developing countries, where more than 75 percent of the world’s fish consumption occurs. In addition to protein, fish contain micronutrients and long- chain omega- 3 fatty acids that are essential for maternal and child health, but often deficient in the diets of the poor. However, the global supply of wild-caught fish has long peaked and is unlikely to rise again unless <b>overexploited</b> <b>stocks</b> are rehabilitated. As world fish consumption continues to grow, aquaculture (fish farming) has emerged to meet demand. Already, just under half of all fish that people consume come from aquaculture, {{which is one of}} the world’s fastest-growing animal food producing sectors. With the supply of wild-caught fish stagnant, any future increase in world fish consumption will need to be supplied by aquaculture. In a resource-constrained world, aquaculture could be an attractive option for expanding animal protein supply. Farmed finfish are similar in feed conversion efficiency to poultry, and much more efficient than beef. Filter-feeding carp and mollusks are even more efficient producers of animal protein, as they require no human-managed feeds and can improve water quality.

40|$|The {{groundfish}} fisheries of the Atlantic and Pacific {{coasts of}} the US are valuable economically and ecologically. The {{industries in the}} two locations have faced depleted stocks and increased regulations by the New England and Pacific Fishery Management Councils over the years. Both fisheries contain a varied array of demersal fish in separate ecosystem contexts, and similar gear types are used in both locations. However, the community and geographical structures, composition and interactions of the Fishery Management Councils, industry organization, and activism create a different historical perspective with which to view management failures and successes. In New England, factors such as a greater value of independence, a lack of cooperation and coordination between stakeholders and scientists, and a longer history of fishery decline {{have contributed to the}} current management climate. The Pacific groundfishery has experienced a more recent illumination of overexploitation, but there is a longer history of cooperation between states, fishermen, and scientists. In addition, differences in the Pacific Fishery Management Council structure and process have created a distinct management picture.

The overall {{objective}} of the Working Group is to contribute to improved management of demersal resources in the Southern CECAF area through assessment {{of the state of}} the stocks and fisheries to ensure optimal and sustainable use of the resources for the benefit of coastal countries. Separate sections have been devoted to each of the following five groups: Demersal Fish South 1, Demersal Fish South 2, Demersal Fish South 3, Shrimps South and Cephalopods South. For each of the sections information is provided on: the fisheries, sampling intensity, biological characteristics, stock identity, trends in data (catch, effort, biological data and abundance indices), assessment, management recommendations and future research. Trends and quality of the basic data (catch, effort and length frequencies) collected by each country, were one the main topics of discussion during the 2008 Working Group meeting. The results of the assessments show that many of the stocks analysed are fully to overexploited, and the working group thus recommended that fishing effort should be reduced for the <b>overexploited</b> <b>stocks</b> to avoid further depletion or not increased for the other stocks. For most of the stocks assessed, the only series of stock abundance indices available were commercial catch per unit effort (CPUE) data series. Commercial CPUE series are affected by changes in fleet size and fishing strategy. Consequently changes observed in the CPUEs do not necessarily reflect the variations in stock abundance. When possible, recommendations on catch levels are also indicated for each stock.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of technical efficiency (TE) on the small-scale fishery is relevant for several reasons. While {{this type of}} fishery is highly common in developing countries like Mexico, there are a very limited number of analyses assessing their efficiency. Indeed, there is no precise information on {{the contribution of the}} small-scale fisheries to livelihoods and economies in developing nations. Exploring this gap in the research would be relevant for the decision making policy. On the one hand, small-scale fisheries can generate significant profits and be more resilient to shocks and crises; two important elements to poverty alleviation and food security. But on the other hand, small-scale fisheries may <b>overexploit</b> <b>stocks,</b> harming the environment and generating low profits. Certainly, it is desirable the preservation of resources of common access like lakes or reservoirs, {{at the same time it}} is desirable an efficient use of the fishery. The question is what factors constrain the efficiency? Aiming for a contribution on the knowledge of the small-scale fisher’s performance; this research applies “directed acyclic graphs”, an innovative technique to explore the causal relationship on the variables to explain the TE. To assess the fisher’s TE, this research uses “stochastic frontier analysis”, a method commonly used to estimate the efficiency. This study explores the causal pattern among the production function variables to corroborate, by estimating the TE, the hypothesis that: fisher’s skills favor the fisher performance. Compared to previous research, the results show an improvement on the assessment of the variables that constrain the efficiency. Getting a more precise TE assessment is valuable information.

The objective is to examine whether modifying the species selectivity properties can contribute to rebuild <b>overexploited</b> <b>stocks.</b> To meet this objective, conceptual and empirical bioeconomic models were constructed. The conceptual model was used to investigate the qualitative impacts and the empirical model was used to derive the quantitative impacts of modifying the species selectivity properties of the gear. ^ In the conceptual part of this study, a stylized model was developed to analyze the longrun equilibrium bioeconomic properties of modifying the species selectivity properties of the gears. The study examined two polar cases, namely when the gears were perfectly non-selective and perfectly selective. ^ The analysis showed {{that there was a}} considerable amount of uncertainty regarding the impact of technological improvement. Policy prescriptions for rebuilding stocks varied dramatically {{depending on the type of}} technology employed and the presence of biological interrelationships. In the perfectly non-selective gear case, rebuilding strategies would benefit from decreasing the catchability of the overexploited species as long as the stocks were biologically independent. In the presence of biological interrelationships, decreasing the catchability yielded ambiguous results. Other policies, such as increasing the catchability of accompanying species, and simultaneously decreasing the catchability of the target species and increasing the catchability of the accompanying species also generated ambiguous results. ^ In the empirical part of the study, a bioeconomic model of the Georges Bank multispecies fishery was constructed. The model had four species groups (roundfish, flatfish, elasmobranchs, and pelagics) and three gears types (otter trawl, gillnet and longline). The model evaluated the long-term biological and economic implications of changing the gear design or configuration (technology-based changes) and the creation of a tax-subsidy program (market-based changes). ^ Model results suggested that technological and market-based programs could aid in the rebuilding process; however, by themselves they are insufficient to recover the <b>stocks.</b> Rebuilding the <b>overexploited</b> roundfish and flatfish stocks requires significant reduction in fishing effort. ...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{ecosystem}} health has been severely degraded {{by years of}} overfishing and ineffective management. Fisheries provide a source of food, jobs, and products and are backed by significant commercial, social, and industrial interests. Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) was a major legislative benchmark for fisheries management, establishing regional management councils and national fishing standards. Single species, or target-focused management practices have been ineffective at preventing overfishing, bycatch, and habitat degradation. Fisheries continue to be unsustainable. The Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA - 1996 MSFCMA amendments) and the MSFCMA reauthorization in 2006, seek to shift management’s perspective to an ecosystem-based approach. The SFA formed the Ecosystem Principles Advisory Panel (EPAP) to research federal fisheries and management {{and to develop a}} model to advise Congress and managers. The panel identified basic principles of marine ecosystems and developed policies for ecosystem-based management, promoting health and sustainability. The high degree of uncertainty associated with ecosystem-based management has created considerable opposition. Fishermen and industries are unwilling to trade current economic benefits for future marine health, despite the benefits of stable, sustainable harvests. The EPAP seeks to shift the burden of proof to the fishing industry, requiring fishing practices be shown not to harm {{ecosystem health}} before permitting them. Further research should consider the ecosystem effects of fishing, trends and dynamics to align science, policy, and management goals. Panel recommendations extend current fishery management plans (FMPs) to consider fisheries on an ecosystem scale (fishery ecosystem plans, FEPs). FEPs consider interactions between target and non-target species, habitat, and human activities through precautionary management. There is no mandate for the adoption of FEPs, but the framework exists and policy is catching up with science. Many ecosystem principles are marginally applied in current management (i. e. marine protected areas). Progress has recently been made to transition from single-species fisheries management to ecosystem-based, but there is still room for improvement. Conservation groups and consumers can aid the implementation of regulation by rewarding sustainable fishing and management efforts. Only through future research, public support, inter-disciplinary cooperation, and risk-averse practices can fisheries management rebuild <b>overexploited</b> <b>stocks</b> and return fishery ecosystem health...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. A {{major problem}} {{affecting}} world fisheries today is overcapacity of which overfishing {{is both a}} cause and a consequence. Subsidies are now widely perceived as an underlying cause of overcapacity, the negative environmental, social and economic effects {{of which can be}} masked by increasing support from the government. Subsidies that reduce the costs of fishing and increase profits for the industry can insulate fishers from economic signals, countering the economic incentive to stop fishing when it is unprofitable. Subsidies can thus be a major impediment to achieving economically productive fisheries, particularly in the absence of effective management systems. It is thus ironic that the dual crisis of overfishing and overcapacity is usually generated by the management system itself. Despite continued effort, fleet overcapacity continues to be the fundamental problem of the European Unions Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Capacity reduction schemes, such as buy-back programs, have not been very effective since generally only the least efficient vessels are bought up, leaving total fishing capacity largely intact. On the other hand, vessel construction subsidies and modernisation schemes are also particularly damaging, helping to reduce operating costs and further increase the economic incentives underlying overcapacity. Fuel price support is another type of subsidy reducing the operating costs particularly since fuel constitutes a significant component of fishing costs, contributing up to 60 percent in some fisheries. By reducing operating costs and thus enabling an increase in fishing effort, fuel subsidies are contributing to increasing fishing pressure and overexploitation of fish stocks. As a result, fuel subsidies support economically unprofitable practices that undermine future economic benefits. A long-term approach is needed that encompasses more fundamental changes than using more efficient engines that initially reduce fuel consumption but in the long-run worsen the situation by contributing to increasing fishing effort on already <b>overexploited</b> <b>stocks.</b> In this view and on account of the global fisheries crises and highly subsidised fisheries, this study aims at estimating the impact of eliminating cost-reducing and capacity-enhancing fisheries subsidies on the Azorean economy.

40|$|International audienceThe Nephrops trawl {{fishery is}} one of the most {{important}} fisheries in the Bay of Biscay. The fishery management essentially relies on conservation measures, a total allowed catch (TAC) for Nephrops together with a minimum landing size (MLS) and minimum trawl mesh size (70 mm stretched mesh). These measures have failed to prevent high discard levels of many species that characterize the fishery. Nephrops trawlers thus discard about half of their Nephrops catches in numbers (a third in weight) of which only 30 % survive. Nephrops discards mainly occur in younger Nephrops age groups below the MLS. This is a waste for the already <b>overexploited</b> Nephrops <b>stock</b> as well as for the fleet. Based on a bio-economic simulation model, the paper analyses the consequences of several scenarios of improving Nephrops selectivity. The potential impacts of these scenarios on Nephrops biomass, landings, discards and economic indicators (e. g. rent) are examined and a cost–benefit analysis of each scenario is carried out. We show that a better exploitation pattern would benefit fisheries that have high level of discards. Reducing non-commercial Nephrops discards leads to positive net present values of rent with better value realized from the production potential and limited short-term losses for the fishing units. By taking account of the economic dynamics of increasing effort however, we show that selectivity measures are insufficient.

A range of impacts has been identified {{at a variety of}} spatial and temporal scales. Chemical contamination and sewage disposal on the continent {{have been found to be}} long-lived. Contemporary sewage management practices at many coastal stations are insufficient to prevent local contamination but no introduction of non-indigenous organisms through this route has yet been demonstrated. Human activities, particularly construction and transport, have led to disturbances of flora and fauna. A small number of non-indigenous plant and animal species has become established, mostly on the northern Antarctic Peninsula and southern archipelagos of the Scotia Arc. There is little indication of recovery of <b>overexploited</b> fish <b>stocks,</b> and ramifications of fishing activity oil bycatch species and the ecosystem could also be far-reaching. The Antarctic Treaty System and its instruments, in particular the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and the Environmental Protocol, provide a framework within which management of human activities take place. In the face of the continuing expansion of human activities in Antarctica, a more effective implementation of a wide range of measures is essential, in order to ensure comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment, including its intrinsic, wilderness and scientific values which remains a fundamental principle of the Antarctic Treaty System. These measures include effective environmental impact assessments, long-term monitoring, mitigation measures for non-indigenous species, ecosystem-based management of living resources, and increased regulation of National Antarctic Programmes and tourism activities...|$|R
40|$|The {{status of}} the Mediterranean and Black Sea {{fisheries}} was evaluated for the period 1970 - 2010 on a subarea basis, using various indicators including the temporal variability of total landings, the number of recorded stocks, the mean trophic level of the catch, the fishing-in-balance index and the catch-based method of stock classification. All indicators confirmed that the fisheries resources of the Mediterranean and Black Sea are at risk from overexploitation. The pattern of exploitation {{and the state of}} stocks differed among the western (W), central (C) and eastern (E) Mediterranean subareas and the Black Sea (BS), with the E Mediterranean and BS fisheries being in a worst shape. Indeed, in the E Mediterranean and the BS, total landings, mean trophic level of the catch and fishing-in-balance index were declining, the cumulative percentage of <b>overexploited</b> and collapsed <b>stocks</b> was higher, and the percentage of developing stocks was lower, compared to the W and C Mediterranean. Our results confirm the need for detailed and extensive stock assessments across species that will eventually lead to stocks recovering through conservation and management measures...|$|R
40|$|Os parâmetros de crescimento e mortalidade estimados a partir da estrutura em comprimento foram utilizados para avaliar o estado de explotação dos estoques de quatro espécies de grandes bagres da bacia do rio Cuiabá, Pantanal norte. As espécies estudadas foram o barbado, o cachara, o jaú e o pintado. As avaliações foram {{realizadas}} por meio do modelo de rendimento por recruta, considerando os Pontos de Referência Biológicos Fmax, F 0, 1, F = M e F BDR. As análises indicam que os estoques do pintado e do jaú estão bem conservados. Os estoques do cachara e, menos fortemente, o do barbado estão em iminente ameaça de sobrepesca na bacia do rio Cuiabá. The {{growth and}} mortality parameters estimated from length structure {{were used to}} evaluate the state of explotation of the stocks of four large catfish species from Cuiabá River basin, north Pantanal. The species studied were the Flatwhiskered catfish, the Jaú, the Barred sorubim, and the Spotted sorubim. The assessment were conducted with the yield per recruit model, and the Biological Reference Points Fmax, F 0. 1, F = M, and F BDR. The analysis indicates that the stocks of the Spotted sorubim, and of the Jaú are not <b>overexploited.</b> However, the <b>stocks</b> of the Barred sorubim, and, in lower degree, of the Flatwhiskered catfish of the Cuiabá River basin are in imminent threat of overfishing...|$|R
40|$|Globally, {{many fish}} species are <b>overexploited,</b> and many <b>stocks</b> have collapsed. This crisis, along with {{increasing}} concerns over flow-on effects on ecosystems, {{has caused a}} reevaluation of traditional fisheries management practices, and a new ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) paradigm has emerged. As part of this approach, selective fishing is widely encouraged {{in the belief that}} nonselective fishing has many adverse impacts. In particular, incidental bycatch is seen as wasteful and a negative feature of fishing, and methods to reduce bycatch are implemented in many fisheries. However, recent advances in fishery science and ecology suggest that a selective approach may also result in undesirable impacts both to fisheries and marine ecosystems. Selective fishing applies {{one or more of the}} " 6 -S" selections: species, stock, size, sex, season, and space. However, selective fishing alters biodiversity, which in turn changes ecosystem functioning and may affect fisheries production, hindering rather than helping achieve the goals of EBFM. We argue here that a "balanced exploitation" approach might alleviate many of the ecological effects of fishing by avoiding intensive removal of particular components of the ecosystem, while still supporting sustainable fisheries. This concept may require reducing exploitation rates on certain target species or groups to protect vulnerable components of the ecosystem. Benefits to society could be maintained or even increased because a greater proportion of the entire suite of harvested species is used...|$|R
40|$|A Mexican federal agency, FONATUR, is {{planning}} a development project in Loreto, Baja California Sur, which will cause a ten-fold increase in the population and significant urban development along the coast.   The development planned for Loreto will take place along the western boundary of the National Marine Park Bay of Loreto (NMPBL), which was established to manage renewable and nonrenewable resources and to restore critical habitats. The park is home to commercial and sport fishing as well as ecotourism. Growths in tourism and in resident populations of the Loreto region will likely result {{in an increase in}} demand for fish. As the fleets of commercial and artisanal fisheries grow, the increase in fishing effort will intensify pressure on already <b>overexploited</b> local fish <b>stocks.</b> In addition, coastal development and pollution can result in the modification of areas that can serve as potential recruitment habitat for important fisheries species. In order to support any type of development in the area, management officials and city and government officials need to regulate and control all activities that impact the region’s natural resource stocks. The most urgent need is the establishment of ecosystem-based fisheries management, and officials must find an effective way to implement and enforce this management scheme. Conservation of critical habitats and spawning aggregations should be among the most important issues to address since their protection ensures replenishment of adult populations of target species...|$|R
40|$|In {{their recent}} paper Worm et al. (1) {{emphasize}} two important observations: that ocean biodiversity is generally beneficial for ecosystem services, including fisheries, and that numbers of <b>overexploited</b> or depleted <b>stocks</b> have increased over several decades. Both observations underpin {{the need for}} reducing fishing pressure and/or ensuring stock recoveries. Thus, the paper represents a useful contribution to the ongoing discussion. Unfortunately, the paper has two main flaws: Firstly the authors model the depletion of stocks {{as a function of}} time (year) which is then used to predict a 100 % collapse for all taxa currently fished by 2048, whereas the maximum observed in their data was only 30 %. Extrapolating 45 years into the future from a model with no mechanistic basis is extremely unsafe. Since the authors themselves mention "the inherent problem of inferring causality from correlation in the larger-scale studies" this prediction is even more problematic because it remains unclear how much any collapse can be explained by fisheries alone. Thus, it could be possible that the characteristics of the relationship will change at higher collapse levels (sigmoid, oscillating, [...] .). Secondly, the authors analyze the utility of marine closed areas and conclude that such closures, in general, are beneficial to marine ecosystems and fisheries. This analysis is based on a sample of case studies which is entirely unrepresentative of global fisheries; of the 49 papers which are the basis for this study, 27 are from coral reefs, while only 6 are from groundfish fisheries and none are from pelagic fisheries. The conclusions from such a subset cannot realistically be projected to the situation across global fisheries since groundfish and pelagic fisheries are by far the most important (2). 1) 	Worm et al.

40|$|The {{southern}} king crab, Lithodes santolla Molina, {{and stone}} crab, Paralomis granulosa Jacquinot, inhabit the cold-temperate waters of southernmost South America (southern Chile and Argentina), where stocks of both species are endangered by overfishing. Recent investigations {{have shown that}} these crabs show life-cycle adaptations to scarcity of food and low temperatures prevailing in subantarctic regions, including complete lecithotrophy of all larval stages and prolonged periods of brooding and longevity. However, growth and development to maturity are slow under conditions of low temperatures, which may explain the particular vulnerability of subpolar lithodids to fisheries. In the present study, juvenile L. santolla and P. granulosa were individually reared in the laboratory at constant temperatures ranging from 3 – 15 °C, and rates of survival and development through successive instars were monitored throughout {{a period of about}} nine months from hatching. When the experiments were terminated, L. santolla had maximally reached juvenile instar IV (at 6 °C), V (9 °C), or VII (15 °C). In P. granulosa the maximum crab instar reached was II (at 3 °C), V (6 °C), V (9 °C), or VII (15 °C). The intermoult period decreased with increasing temperature, while it increased in successively later instars. In consequence, growth rate showed highly significant differences among temperatures (P< 0. 001). Growth-at-moult was highest at 9 °C. Rates of survival decreased significantly in juvenile P. granulosa with increasing temperature. Only at 15 °C in L. santolla, was a significantly enhanced mortality found compared with lower temperatures. Our results indicate that juvenile stages of L. santolla and P. granulosa are well adapted to 5 – 10 °C, the range of temperatures typically prevailing in subantarctic marine environments. In spite of causing higher mortality rates, higher rearing temperatures (12 – 15 °C) should accelerate the rates of growth and maturation, which may be favourable for projects aiming at aquaculture or repopulation of <b>overexploited</b> king crab <b>stocks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Prudent {{management}} of marine fish resources relies on separation and {{management of}} biologically meaningful groups of conspecifics, termed fishery stocks, often depicted as self-sustaining, spatiotemporally separated and demographically independent entities. Such stock discrimination has however proven challenging. Although most marine fish species form local spawning populations (in relation to hydrological and topographical features that promote local juvenile retention), the level of genetic and demographic connectivity among them is difficult to quantify, given that marine fish often display low genetic differentiation, implying gene flow among local populations mediated by dispersal and migrations in a “barrier free” environment. In this thesis I assess regional genetic structure and phenotypic divergence in a “high gene flow” fish species, the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), and re-evaluate the current stock division into an Eastern Baltic (EB) and Western Baltic (WB) cod stock. I also assess genetic consequences of population size reductions in a regional population assemblage of brown trout (Salmo trutta), used as a model system to draw conclusions relevant to <b>overexploited</b> fishery <b>stocks.</b> I examine genetic structure in a regional assemblage of local cod populations, making up a transitional admixture zone that separates the non-admixed North Sea stocks from non-admixed Baltic Sea stocks. In spite of a gradient in genetic admixture, which coincides with a gradient in salinity, local cod populations form two differentiated genetic clusters (stock complexes); a North Sea stock complex (Kattegat & Öresund), and a Baltic Sea proper stock complex (Arkona & Bornholm basins). This division is supported by recent genetic work, but is not congruent with the current EB and WB stock division. I also assess stock mixing in the Öresund management subdivision, an interface between inferred stock complexes, seeing increasing stock mixing (proportion Baltic genotypes) with decreasing distance from the Baltic Sea proper, and non-negligible but stable stock mixing throughout a single season. The combination of non-negligible migrant influx and maintained genetic differentiation might imply regionally prevailing spatiotemporal spawning separation and homing. I assess phenotypic and behavioural divergence in a local cod population, manifested through biased catches with regard to body condition, growth and body morphology. Evidence suggest that the observed divergence constitute within-stock behavioural components (not genetically divergent populations) most likely induced by increased intraspecific competition within the Baltic Sea proper. The inconsistent spatial genetic structures historically inferred for Baltic cod raises questions regarding the spatiotemporal stability of an admixture zone. To examine how population size reductions (and ensuing density dependent migrations and interactions) influence the genetic integrity of populations and the regional genetic admixture, I assess genetic variability within an assemblage of trout populations that suffered recent region-wide population decimations and recoveries. Recovered populations were characterized by lower genetic differentiation and higher genetic admixture, implying that population size reductions could endanger the genetic integrity of local populations. Such density-dependent genetic integrity is of relevance also to cod, given the drastic declines in Baltic cod stocks from overexploitation in the 1980 s and 1990 s. In summary, my work suggests that stock discrimination and stock division must be more dynamic, especially for population assemblages experiencing genetic admixture, exploitation, and stock size reductions. Given that stock size reductions can increase genetic admixture from density-dependent gene flow, and that gene flow can counteract local adaptation, overexploitation can have unforeseen detrimental effects on local populations...|$|R
40|$|The twelfth {{meeting of}} the FAO Working Group on the Assessment of Small Pelagic Fish off Northwest Africa was held in Dakar, Senegal from 21 to 25 May 2012. Total catch of small pelagic fish for the period 1990 to 2011 has been {{fluctuating}} {{with an average of}} around 1. 8 million tonnes, with an overall general increasing trend since 1994. Although important changes were observed in the abundance and exploitation level for some of the stocks, the overall general situation with respect to the state of the different stocks was found to be similar to the results of the 2011 Working Group, {{with the exception of the}} Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) which this year was considered overexploited. The Cunene horse mackerel (Trachurus trecae) showed some improvement and is considered fully exploited. The Small Pelagic Working Group recommends a decrease in catch and effort on the horse mackerels stocks to ensure sustainable harvesting of these stocks. The catches of round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) are high for the last three years. The Working Group continues to be concerned about this stock and considers it is <b>overexploited.</b> The sardine <b>stock</b> in Zone A+B is still considered overexploited and the Working Group therefore maintains its recommendation from the previous years that the catch should not exceed 400 000 tonnes. Sardine (Sardina pilchardus) in Zone C is not fully exploited. However, the stock structure and abundance should be closely monitored by fishery independent methods, and care must be taken in the management of sardine in Zone C. Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) were both considered fully exploited. In the case of anchovy the Working Group recommends that effort should not exceed current levels whereas for mackerel it was recommended that catches should not exceed 250 000 tonnes. Previous assessments have considered bonga (Ethmalosa fimbriata) as a single stock at the subregional level. However, recent changes in the exploitation of this species in Mauritania with the subsequent large catches make it difficult to assess this species at the subregional level and the group, on a trial basis, proceeded to carry out two separate assessment; Unit North–Northern Mauritania and Unit South-Senegal/The Gambia respectively. The Working Group recommends that effort should not exceed current levels for the northern unit and to decrease the effort on the southern unit...|$|R
