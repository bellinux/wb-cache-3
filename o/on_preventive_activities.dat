40|$|Today {{there is}} a general {{recognition}} that environmental factors {{play a major role in}} human carcinogenesis. The con-cept that many cancers can be prevented stems from data amassed from epidemiological studies (1, 2). If the increase in the annual number of cancer cases were to continue, one European in three would develop cancer by the year 2000. The situation is similar in the United States and in other parts of the world. The American National Cancer Institute has es-tablished objectives for reducing the annual cancer mortality rate in the United States (i). The target is a 25 %- 50 % reduc-tion in the mortality rate from the 1980 level. The achieve-ment of this goal largely depends <b>on</b> <b>preventive</b> <b>activities,</b> such as a reduction in tobacco smoking and the adoption of a low-fat, high-fiber diet by all Americans.

SOCAFRICA, a theater special operations command (TSOC), executes {{the full spectrum}} of Special Operations in complex environments, emphasizing the indirect approach to operations. The operational emphasis <b>on</b> <b>preventive</b> <b>activities</b> in a steady-state environment provides access, awareness, and options to the U. S. and its partners in the event of crises. Special Operation Forces (SOF) have doubled in size over the past decade, and SOCOM has built tremendous capabilities in that time, but TSOCsthe regional-level SOF organizationshave not shared in these capability increases. Because TSOCs are under-manned and under-resourced, they are not capable of effectively applying the indirect approach to achieve long-term effects for Geographic Combatant Commanders and Chiefs of Mission. Change is needed to improve TSOC effectiveness. This thesis will analyze the organizational shortfalls of TSOCs through the lens of the newest TSOC, SOCAFRICA, and will examine USSOCOMs Global SOF Network concept which intends to provide authorities, capabilities, and resources to TSOCs to make them the force of choice at the regional level.

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that tomato lycopene may be preventive against the formation {{and the development of}} lung cancer. Experimental studies demonstrated that lycopene may inhibit the growth of several cultured lung cancer cells and prevent lung tumorigenesis in animal models. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the growth-inhibitory effects of lycopene on lung cancer, including cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis induction via a modulation of redox status, a regulation of growth factor signalling, changes in cell growth-related enzymes, an enhancement of gap junction communication and a prevention of smoke-induced inflammation. In addition, lycopene also inhibited cell invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Several lycopene metabolites have been identified, raising the question as to whether the preventive effects of lycopene on cancer risk is, at least in part, due to its metabolites.

40|$|The {{concern about}} {{prevention}} programmes being expensive prompted this study into their cost-effectiveness. This report describes preventive health care programmes {{that are very}} cost-effective or even cost-saving. By means of semi-structured interviews, 35 Dutch experts {{in the fields of}} prevention and/or health economics were asked to provide information <b>on</b> <b>preventive</b> <b>activities</b> that they considered to be cost-effective. Targeted literature searches were performed {{on the basis of this}} information. Evidence showing the likelihood of certain prevention programmes being cost-effective or cost-saving led to a thorough examination of the economic evaluation methodology. Only the studies that have adhered to the standards for economic evaluation studies were selected for this report. The experts interviewed listed 30 preventive programmes. For 18 programmes, good quality evidence on cost-effectiveness was found. Some of these programmes are well-known in the Dutch health care system (e. g. PKU test), while others are currently not optimally provided or organised (e. g. folate intake by pregnant women). Some programmes seem especially interesting from an employers' point of view (influenza vaccination of the employed), whereas others have, to date, not been the subject of health-care policy making (e. g. screening for the sexually transmittable bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis). In conclusion, this explorative study demonstrates how the proverb 'an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure' may indeed apply to certain preventive health care programmes...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} profile of the dentist (CD), nurse and {{physician}} (doctor) in the Family Health Strategy (FHS) of Annapolis-GO, Brazil. Methods: A descriptive study with quantitative and qualitative approach. We used a structured questionnaire with closed and open questions to 136 professionals from the FHS of Annapolis-GO, Brazil, in the year 2008. Quantitative data were tabulated and we used content analysis technique for qualitative data. Results: Most professionals surveyed were female, 22 (78. 5 %) CD, 30 (96. 8 %) nurses and 9 (56. 3 %) doctors; aged 20 to 30 years of which 21 (75 %) were CD, 22 (71 %) nurses and 10 (62. 5 %) physicians. Most were newly graduated (0 - 5 years since graduation), especially 28 (90. 3 %) nurses. Almost all professionals lived in the city of Annapolis, with the exception of 4 (14. 3 %) CD. Most professionals, 25 (89. 2 %) CD, 21 (67. 74 %) nurses and 12 (75 %) doctor had a postgraduate course. The clinical activities were most performed by 27 (96. 4 %) CD,and 16 (100 %) physicians. While preventive activities were carried out mostly by 28 (90. 3 %) nurses. The majority, 26 (92. 9 %) CD, 31 (100 %) nurses and 14 (87. 5 %) physicians, believed in the proposition to change the FHS model of health care. Structural and organizationalissues influenced the work, expectations and motivations of professionals. Conclusion: The profile of the higher education professional of the Family Health Strategy in Annapolis - GO is mainly female, young, residing in the city, with a post-graduation and believes in the proposal of the ESF.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Prevention is a {{challenging}} area of primary care. In Switzerland, {{little is known}} about attitudes to and performance of screening and prevention services in general practice. To implement prevention services in primary care {{it is important to know}} about not only potential facilitators but also barriers. Primary care encompasses the activities of general practitioners, including those with particular interest and/or specializations (eg, pediatrics, gynecology). The aim of this study was to review all studies with a focus on prevention services which have been conducted in Switzerland and to reveal barriers and facilitators for physicians to participate in any preventive measures. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and BIOSIS were searched from January 1990 through December 2010. Studies focussing <b>on</b> <b>preventive</b> <b>activities</b> in primary care settings were selected and reviewed. The methodological quality of the identified studies was classified according to the guidelines in the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. RESULTS: We identified 49 studies including 45 descriptive studies and four randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Twelve studies addressed the prevention of epidemics, eleven out of them vaccinations. Further studies focused on lifestyle changes, physical activity counselling, smoking cessation, cardiovascular prevention and cancer screening. Perceived lack of knowledge/training and lack of time were the most commonly stated barriers. Motivation, feasibility and efficiency were the most frequently reported supporting factors for preventive activities. The methodological quality was weak, only one out of four RCTs met the applied quality criteria. CONCLUSION: Most studies focussing on screening and prevention activities in primary care addressed vaccination, lifestyle modification or cardiovascular disease prevention. Identified barriers and facilitators indicate a need for primary-care-adapted education and training which are easy to handle, time-saving and reflect the specific needs of general practitioners. If new prevention programs are to be implemented in general practices, RCTs of high methodological quality are needed to assess their impact...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Various natural {{carotenoids}} {{have been}} proven to have anticarcinogenic activity. Epidemiological investigations have shown that cancer risk is inversely related to the consumption of green and yellow vegetables and fruits. As b-carotene is present in abundance in these vegetables and fruits, it has been investigated extensively as a possible cancer preventive agent. However, various carotenoids which coexist with b-carotene in vegetables and fruits also have anticarcinogenic activity, and some of these, such as a-carotene, lutein and lycopene, show a higher potency than b-carotene in suppressing experimental carcinogenesis. Thus, we have carried out more extensive studies <b>on</b> cancer <b>preventive</b> <b>activities</b> of natural carotenoids in foods. For example, we found that b-cryptoxanthin showed antitumor initiating activity, as well as antitumor promoting activity. It is of interest that not only carotenoids distributed in vegetables and fruits, but also animal carotenoids, such as astaxanthin, are promising as cancer preventive agents. In the present study, the cancer preventive potential of phytoene was also con®rmed. The establishment of NIH 3 T 3 cells that produce phytoene by introducing the crtB gene provides evidence that resistance against transformation, imposed by transfection of activated H-ras oncogene, was acquired by phytoene production. Analysis of the action mechanism of these natural carotenoids is now in progress, and some interesting results have already been obtained; for example, various carotenoids were suggested to stimulate the expression of RB gene, an antioncogene...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether major depressive episodes (MDE) contribute to a lower rate of participation in three prevention activities: blood pressure checks, mammograms and Pap tests. Methods The data source for this study was the Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS), a longitudinal study that started in 1994 and has subsequently re-interviewed its participants every two years. The NPHS included a short form version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-SF) to assess past year MDE and also collected data <b>on</b> participation in <b>preventive</b> <b>activities.</b> Initially, we examined whether respondents with MDE in a particular year were less likely to participate in screening during that same year. In order to assess whether MDE negatively altered the pattern of participation, those successfully screened at the baseline interview in 1994 were identified and divided into cohorts depending on their MDE status. Proportional hazard models were used to quantify the effect of MDE on subsequent participation in screening. Results No effect of MDE on participation in the three <b>preventive</b> <b>activities</b> was identified either in the cross-sectional or longitudinal analysis. Adjustment for a set of relevant covariates did not alter this result. Conclusion Whereas MDE might be expected to reduce the frequency of participation in screening activities, no evidence for this was found in the current analysis. Since people with MDE may contact the health system more frequently, this may offset any tendency of the illness itself to reduce participation in screening. </p...|$|R

We decided to prioritize the major areas of research on HIV/AIDS in Iran. Materials ans Methods : In a brain-storming session with the main national and provincial stakeholders and experts from different relevant fields, the direct and indirect dimensions of HIV/AIDS and its related research issues were explored. Afterward, using the Delphi method, we sent questionnaires to 20 experts (13 respondents) from different sectors. In this electronic based questioner, we requested experts to evaluate main topics and their subtopics. The ranges of scores were between 0 and 100. Results: The score of priorities of main themes were <b>preventive</b> <b>activities</b> (43. 2), large scale planning (25. 4), the estimation of the HIV/AIDS burden (20. 9), and basic scientific research (10. 5). The most important priority in each main theme was education particularly in high risk groups (52. 5), developing the national strategy to address the epidemic (31. 8), estimation of the incidence and prevalence among high-risk groups (59. 5) and developing new preventive methods (66. 7), respectively. Conclusions: The most important priorities of researches <b>on</b> HIV/AIDS were <b>preventive</b> <b>activities</b> and developing national strategy. As high risk groups are the most involved people in the epidemic, and {{they are also the}} most hard-to-reach sub-populations, a national well designated comprehensive strategy is essential.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on a {{collection}} of essays and studies the behavioral consequences of the concept of ambiguity for a variety of economic models. After introducing the reader to the fundamentals of decision-theory, I proceed by considering a Hotelling duopoly game under demand ambiguity. Firms' preferences are assumed to be of the Choquet-expected-utility-type. In this framework, I derive firms' subgame-perfect product differentiation. It turns out that confidence is a differentiation force when firms are sufficiently optimistic. This finding has important consequences for the interpretation of various applications of Hotelling models under uncertainty treated by Król (2012). Subsequently, ambiguity is implemented in the context of primary prevention. In particular, I contemplate a physician-counseling model where Choquet-expected-utility-maximizing patients face ambiguity with respect to the relationship between their level of adherence to a preventive regime and the resulting probability of disease. In this framework, I examine the effect of confidence and optimism <b>on</b> <b>preventive</b> <b>activities.</b> It turns out that the effect of optimism on prevention is determined by two concurrent effects, which are denoted as "perceived efficacy effect" and "expected marginal utility effect". The perceived efficacy effect captures the fact that optimists and pessimists might differ in their assessment of the preventive regime's capability to reduce the underlying probability of disease. The expected marginal utility effect takes into account that a shift in the perceived disease probability might increase or decrease marginal gains or losses from additional units of prevention. In the following step, I introduce information into the previous setting. Information is modeled by means of an imprecise signal provided by the physician. Patients update their beliefs in the light of new information by using one of the three major updating rules for neo-additive capacities introduced by Eichberger et al. (2010). It turns out that Knightian uncertainty can, depending on the underlying updating rule, provide an explanation for poor patient compliance as well as excessive preventive behavior. The ensuing chapter turns to the famous Blackwell's theorem and its extension to MEU-preferences proposed by Ҫelen (2012) showing that Ҫelen’s notion of a value of information under MEU is incompatible with dynamic consistency. Finally, I conclude with an application of ambiguity to monopoly pricing. Using the most prominent models of decision-making under ambiguity, I derive the implications of ambiguity for monopoly pricing. In the Choquet case with neo-additive capacities, I can demonstrate that pessimism reduces the resulting monopoly price whereas confidence decreases (increases) monopoly prices if the monopolist is sufficiently optimistic (pessimistic) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{research}} aims {{to discuss}} the importance of introduction of ICTs {{in the concept of}} societal resilience building and analyze e-tools engaging the public in safety enhancement. Methodology – The authors of this paper analyzed scientific literature to identify the main elements of societal resilience building, to distinguish the areas in which social technologies could be applied for the purposes of enhancing resilience. Empirical study was focused on the search and content analysis of global, EU, Lithuanian national and local e-tools created to inform the public about imminent and/or actual disasters and emergencies, communicate data among civil protection authorities, and collect from and disseminate among society disaster related information. Findings – Contemporary disaster management is increasingly orienting <b>on</b> <b>preventive</b> <b>activities</b> based on inclusion of society. Evolving the concept of societal resilience focuses on enhancing abilities of communities or society to resist, absorb, accommodate and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner. Consequently, resilience moves from a passive technical concept, relevant to resistance of infrastructures, to a socially active process, supporting the phase of risk prevention. Therefore, it should be present in all phases, from risk prevention to emergency management. In the Internet enabled society, information and communication technologies (ICTs) could foster building of the capacity of resilience in urban and regional complex systems by informing, warning and directing people for correct actions in case of disasters. There is a number of e-tools designed for exchange of information at different levels (global, EU, national, local, organizational), serving for different tasks of pre-, during or/and post-disaster management. Those could be grouped by their purposes to the following ones: e-tools for warning of communities at risk, based on broadcasting; WebGIS-based crowdsourcing platforms to collect and update user generated content; Open-source ICT platforms Oriented on Public awareness on natural disasters; ICTs for civil protection planning, decision making for response, recovery and allocation of resources in case of disasters. The most oriented on public engagement are broadcasting and crowdsourcing based ICT tools. However, the empirical research revealed that use of such kind of social technologies by Lithuanians remains relatively vague in terms of public activity: crowdsourcing platforms are mostly uploaded with small-scale problems of everyday life character, and use of the broadcasting services among citizens is not popular enough yet, and some organizational and technological barriers worsen situation even more. This could point to an assumption that Lithuanian society does not percept disasters as real threats for their lives, health, property or environment. Research limitations – The current research is not sophisticated with the comparative analysis of experiences of foreign countries in application of broadcasting and crowdsourcing based technologies for increasing societal resilience. Such analysis could be useful for development of effective means for enhancing public awareness on disasters, consequently – for building safety culture in Lithuania by application of social technologies. Therefore, investigation of good praxis could be considered as a relevant topic for further research. Practical implications – The paper explores publically accessible ICT means that could serve for enhancing of information and education level of the public on disaster related content, and hence, for rising safety culture. Originality/Value – The research reveals societal resilience as an active process, supporting the phase of risk prevention, not only disaster response and recovery. The paper assumes the triple role of citizens in all disaster management process. By application of social technologies, society acts as a safety information source (by application of crowdsourcing based e-tools); as information transmitters (when ICTs include information sharing functions); and as information receivers (WebGIS and cell broadcast based ICTs). Therefore, the research implies disaster management authorities to pay more attention for social technologies as potential tools for increasing pro-activity of disaster management and building up societal resilience.

However, subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) has a major flaw in side effects, and especially in possible anaphylactic reactions, and this prompted the search for safer ways of administration of allergen extracts. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has met such need while maintaining a clinical efficacy comparable to SCIT. In fact, the safety profile, as outlined by a systematic revision of the available literature, was substantially free from serious systemic reactions. A number of meta-analyses clearly showed that SLIT is effective in allergic rhinitis by significantly reducing the clinical symptoms and the use of anti-allergic drugs, while the efficacy in allergic asthma is still debated, with some meta-analyses showing clear effectiveness but other giving contrasting results. Besides the efficacy <b>on</b> symptoms, the <b>preventive</b> <b>activity</b> and the cost-effectiveness are important outcomes of SLIT in asthma. The needs to meet include more data on efficacy in house dust mite asthma, optimal techniques of administration and, as previously done with SCIT, introduction of adjuvants able to enhance the immunologic response and use of recombinant allergens...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Nonalcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease {{is the most}} common chronic liver disease in the world, and is {{becoming}} increasingly prevalent. Saponins of sea cucumber (SSC) are proven to exhibit various biological activities. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to examine the effect of saponins extracted from sea cucumber (Pearsonothuria graeffei) <b>on</b> the <b>preventive</b> <b>activity</b> of fatty liver in rats. Methods Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups, including normal control group, fatty liver model group, SSC-treated group with SSC at levels of 0. 01 %, 0. 03 % and 0. 05 %. Model rats were established by administration with 1 % orotic acid (OA). After the experiment period, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and hepatic lipid concentrations were determined. To search for a possible mechanism, we examined the changes of key enzymes and transcriptional factors involved in hepatic lipids biosynthesis, fatty acid β-oxidation. Results Both 0. 03 % and 0. 05 % SSC treatment alleviated hepatic steatosis and reduced serum TG and TC concentration significantly in OA fed rats. Hepatic lipogenic enzymes, such as fatty acid synthase (FAS), malic enzyme (ME), and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PDH) activities were inhibited by SSC treatment. SSC also decreased the gene expression of FAS, ME, G 6 PDH and sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP- 1 c). Otherwise, the rats feeding with SSC showed increased carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) activity in the liver. Hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα), together with its target gene CPT and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) mRNA expression were also upregulated by SSC. Conclusions According to our study, the lipids-lowering effect of dietary SSC may be partly associated with the enhancement of β-oxidation via PPARα activation. In addition, the inhibited SREBP- 1 c- mediated lipogenesis caused by SSC may also contribute to alleviating fatty liver. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical {{practice}} guidelines, such {{as those}} of the Canadian Task Force <b>on</b> <b>Preventive</b> Health Care, although based on sound evidence, may conflict with the perceived needs and expectations of patients and physicians. This may jeopardize the implementation of such guidelines. This study was undertaken to explore patients' and family physicians' acceptance of the task force's recommendations and the values and criteria upon which the opinions of these 2 groups are based. METHODS: Focus groups were used to collect study data. In total, 35 physicians (in 7 groups) and 75 patient representatives (in 9 groups) participated in the focus groups. An inductive approach was used to develop coding grids and to generate themes from the transcripts of the interviews. RESULTS: Physicians expressed resistance to discontinuing the annual check-up, which they viewed as an organizational strategy to counteract the many barriers to preventive care that they encounter. They reported difficulties in explaining to their patients the recommendations of the Canadian Task Force <b>on</b> <b>Preventive</b> Health Care, which they found complex and inconsistent with popular wisdom. Both patients and physicians attributed high value to the detection of insidious diseases, {{even in the absence of}} proof of the effectiveness of such activity. INTERPRETATION: The patients and family physicians who participated in this study shared many opinions on the value of <b>preventive</b> <b>activities</b> that depart from the values used by "prevention experts" such as the Canadian Task Force <b>on</b> <b>Preventive</b> Health Care in establishing their recommendations. A better understanding of the values of patients and physicians would help guideline developers to create better targeted communication strategies to take these discrepancies into account...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Financial {{incentives}} and audit plus feedback on performance are two strategies commonly used by governments to motivate general practitioners (GP) to undertake specific healthcare activities. However, in recent years, governments have reduced or removed incentive payments without {{evidence of the}} potential impact on GP behaviour and patient outcomes. This trial (known as ACCEPt-able) aims to determine whether <b>preventive</b> care <b>activities</b> in general practice are sustained when financial {{incentives and}}/or external audit plus feedback <b>on</b> <b>preventive</b> care <b>activities</b> are removed. The activity investigated is annual chlamydia testing for 16 - to 29 -year-old adults, a key preventive health strategy within this age group. METHODS/DESIGN ACCEPt-able builds on a large cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) that evaluated a 3 -year chlamydia testing intervention in general practice. GPs were provided with a support package to facilitate annual chlamydia testing of all sexually active 16 - to 29 -year-old patients. This package included financial incentive payments to the GP for each chlamydia test conducted and external audit plus feedback on each GP's chlamydia testing rates. ACCEPt-able is a factorial cluster RCT in which general practices are randomised to one of four groups: (i) removal of audit plus feedback-continue to receive financial incentive payments for each chlamydia test; (ii) removal of financial incentive payments-continue to receive audit plus feedback; (iii) removal of financial incentive payments and audit plus feedback; and (iv) continue financial incentive payments and audit plus feedback. The primary outcome is chlamydia testing rate measured as the proportion of sexually active 16 - to 29 -year-olds who have a GP consultation within a 12 -month period {{and at least one}} chlamydia test. DISCUSSION This will be the first RCT to examine the impact of removal of financial incentive payments and audit plus feedback on the chlamydia testing behaviour of GPs. This trial is particularly timely and will increase our understanding about the impact of financial incentives and audit plus feedback on GP behaviour when governments are looking for opportunities to control healthcare budgets and maximise clinical outcomes for money spent. The results of this trial will have implications for supporting preventive health measures beyond the content area of chlamydia.
