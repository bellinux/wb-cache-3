5|$|Despite {{its small}} size, the least weasel is a fierce hunter, capable <b>of</b> <b>killing</b> <b>a</b> rabbit {{five to ten}} times its own weight. Although they are {{commonly}} taken, the rabbits are usually young specimens, and become an important food source during the spring, when small rodents are scarce and rabbit kits are plentiful. Male least weasels take {{a higher proportion of}} rabbits than females, as well as an overall greater variety of prey. This is linked to the fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges than females, males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity of prey.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor lobbied {{behind the}} scenes for the 1934 Costigan-Wagner Bill to make lynching a federal crime, {{including}} arranging a meeting between Franklin and NAACP president Walter Francis White. Fearing he would lose the votes of Southern congressional delegations for his legislative agenda, however, Franklin refused to publicly support the bill, which proved unable to pass the Senate. In 1942, Eleanor worked with activist Pauli Murray to persuade Franklin to appeal on behalf of sharecropper Odell Waller, convicted <b>of</b> <b>killing</b> <b>a</b> white farmer during a fight; though Franklin {{sent a letter to}} Virginia Governor Colgate Darden urging him to commute the sentence to life imprisonment, Waller was executed as scheduled.|$|E
5|$|The Shiva Purana adds an continuation: The sin <b>of</b> <b>killing</b> <b>a</b> Brahmin {{transforms}} into {{a monster}} called Brahmahatya, who starts following Kalmashapada. The latter tries {{to escape the}} monster, and finally reaches King Janaka's court. There, the sage Gautama teaches Kalmashapada divine knowledge and directs him to the Shiva temple of Gokarna to free him of his sins. At Gokarna, Kalmashapada performs intense austerities and is liberated from Brahmahatya.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from these}} sculptures, entire {{sequences}} from the Hindu epics (commonly the Ramayana and the Mahabharata) have been sculpted in a clockwise direction {{starting at the}} main entrance. The right to left sequence is the same direction taken by the devotees in their ritual circumambulation as they wind inward toward the inner sanctum. Depictions from mythology such as the epic hero Arjuna shooting fish, the elephant-headed god Ganesha, the Sun god Surya, the weather and war god Indra, and Brahma with Sarasvati are common. Also frequently seen in these temples is Durga, with several arms holding weapons given to her by other gods, in the act <b>of</b> <b>killing</b> <b>a</b> buffalo (a demon in a buffalo's form) and Harihara (a fusion of Shiva and Vishnu) holding a conch, wheel and trident. Many of these friezes were signed by the artisans, the first known instance of signed artwork in India.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} too long, {{and as a}} result many sequences had to be cut, some even after they had been filmed. These included a fight scene with the Doctor and Rosanna's steward (Simon Gregor), a longer fight sequence between Rory and Francesco, and some dialogue between the Doctor and Amy following the climax. In the original script, Amy and Rory cornered Francesco after suspecting him <b>of</b> <b>killing</b> <b>a</b> villager and Francesco climbed up the wall. Whithouse thought this would be a relatively easy stunt, but was told it would be too hard to accomplish and Whithouse revised it to when Francesco simply runs away. When discussing the script with Whithouse, Helen McCrory, who portrayed Rosanna, thought that she should hurt Amy at some point and it was added that she bites Amy while she is in the chamber.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} little {{opportunity}} to study epidemiology in the Sumatran rhinoceros. Ticks and gyrostigma were reported to cause deaths in captive animals in the 19th century. The rhino is also known to be vulnerable to the blood disease surra, which can be spread by horse-flies carrying parasitic trypanosomes; in 2004, all five rhinos at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre died over an 18-day period after becoming infected by the disease. The Sumatran rhino has no known predators other than humans. Tigers and wild dogs may be capable <b>of</b> <b>killing</b> <b>a</b> calf, but calves stay close to their mothers, {{and the frequency of}} such killings is unknown. Although the rhino's range overlaps with elephants and tapirs, the species do not appear to compete for food or habitat. Elephants (Elephas maximus) and Sumatran rhinos are even known to share trails, and many smaller species such as deer, boars, and wild dogs will use the trails the rhinos and elephants create.|$|E

5|$|When {{the crew}} awaken, they find {{themselves}} out of the control beds {{with no sign of}} the Gangers. However, their own personal belongings have been gone through and the TARDIS has sunk into acid-corroded ground. The Doctor explains that they have likely been unconscious {{for more than an hour}} and the Gangers have gained sentience. They soon discover that two of the Gangers are amongst them, posing as Cleaves and Jennifer (Sarah Smart), when the two give themselves away by turning pale-white. Jennifer also exhibits the ability to contort and stretch her body well beyond human limits. The Jennifer Ganger struggles with her new identity and befriends Rory who has begun to demonstrate an emotional attachment to her. The Cleaves Ganger works in secret with the other Gangers to try to kill the real humans, as the human Cleaves plans to kill the Gangers. The Doctor attempts to reunite the two sides but fails when the human Cleaves kills one of the Gangers with a high-powered electrical charge. The Gangers plan an attack, and the Doctor accuses Cleaves <b>of</b> <b>killing</b> <b>a</b> living being which Cleaves refuses to acknowledge. The Ganger Jennifer hunts her human counterpart to kill her. The Doctor determines that in a monastery, the safest place to be is the chapel, and directs everyone there. The Gangers, in acid-protection suits, bear down on the chapel. Rory responds to the sound of Jennifer screaming by deliberately separating from the group, against Amy's wishes. In the chapel, Amy and the Doctor discover a Ganger version of the Doctor.|$|E

5000|$|Avunculicide is the act <b>of</b> <b>killing</b> <b>an</b> uncle. The word {{can also}} refer {{to someone who}} commits such an act.

25|$|Coast redwoods are {{resistant}} to insect attack, fungal infection, and rot.

Despite these chemical defenses, redwoods are still subject to insect infestations; none, however, are capable <b>of</b> <b>killing</b> <b>a</b> healthy tree. Redwoods also face predation from mammals: black bears are reported to consume the inner bark of small redwoods, and black-tailed deer are known to eat redwood sprouts.|$|E
