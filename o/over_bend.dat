Instead of [...] "lean backward as far as possible; {{at the same time the}} head should be lifted and thrown back as far as it will go,"— as Rite No. 3 is described by Kelder — she recommends keeping your spine [...] "long and strong" [...] and to [...] "avoid compression." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{numerical}} analysis of a small flow coefficient stage vaneless diffuser is described. The main purpose of this analysis is to go inside the rotating stall physics with {{particular attention to the}} onset of the rotating cells and their properties. The diffuser aspect ratio (width divided radial extension) is low (0. 03) and the effect of the wall (hub and shroud boundary layers) cannot be neglected. For this reason the model is a 3 D model including the hub, the shroud walls and the downstream 180 ° cross- <b>over</b> <b>bend.</b> The numerical analysis has been carried out using an incompressible, viscous, unsteady commercial solver. Radial and tangential typical velocity profiles as produced by a hypotetical upstream impeller have been applied as boundary conditions and they have been changed in time to simulate the actual throttling valve closure as it is done during a test. Under these circumstances a rotating phenomenon is found to exist similar to what is found experimentally on similar geometries. The instability starts as a complex 3 D flow involving both hub-to-shroud flow pulsations as well as radial non-uniformities and it stabilizes in the form of four rotating cells...|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the 19 notes readily available on the diatonic harmonica, players can play other notes by adjusting their embouchure and forcing the reed to resonate at a different pitch. This technique is called bending, a term possibly borrowed from guitarists, who literally bend a string to subtly change the pitch. Bending also creates the glissandos characteristic of much blues harp and country harmonica playing. Bends are essential for most blues and rock harmonica due to the soulful sounds the instrument can bring out. The [...] "wail" [...] of the blues harp typically requires bending. In the 1970s, Howard Levy developed the <b>over</b> <b>bending</b> technique (also known as [...] "overblowing" [...] and [...] "overdrawing".) <b>Over</b> <b>Bending,</b> combined with bending, allowed players to play the entire chromatic scale.|$|R

Two types of systems which {{fall into this}} category are flexible systems, where many measurements and several actuators are necessary to provide control <b>over</b> <b>bending</b> behavior, and articulated systems which consist of several rigid bodies connected together by pivoting connections. In this latter case, multiple controls are implemented as torquers at the joints...|$|R

40|$|The {{vibrational}} {{temperatures of}} product CO 2 were measured in CO oxidation on Pd(111) {{as a function}} of the desorption angle by means of infrared chemiluminescence. The antisymmetric vibration temperature was separately determined from the other vibrational modes from the normalized chemiluminescence intensity. The product CO 2 desorption is sharply collimated along the surface normal. The antisymmetric vibrational temperature increased from 1300 to 1600 K as the desorption angle increased from 0 degrees to 30 degrees, whereas the averaged vibrational temperature <b>over</b> <b>bending</b> and symmetric modes decreased from 2450 to 1530 K.
