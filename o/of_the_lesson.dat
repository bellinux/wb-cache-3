25|$|The {{community}} language learning (CLL) {{is a method}} proposed by Charles A. Curran during the 1970s. It {{is based on the}} counseling approach in which the teacher is seen as a counselor. It emphasizes the sense of community in the learning group, encourages interaction as a vital aspect of learning, and it considers as a priority the students' feelings and the recognition of struggles in language acquisition. There is no syllabus or textbook to follow and it is the students themselves who determine the content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lesson.</b> Notably, it incorporates translation and recording techniques.|$|E
25|$|As in Germany, {{secondary}} education {{consists of two}} main types of schools, attendance at {{which is based on}} a pupil's ability as determined by grades from the primary school. The Gymnasium caters for the more able children, in the final year of which the Matura examination is taken, which is a requirement for access to university. The Hauptschule prepares pupils for vocational education but also for various types of further education (Höhere Technische Lehranstalt HTL = institution of higher technical education; HAK = commercial academy; HBLA = institution of higher education for economic business; etc.). Attendance at one of these further education institutes also leads to the Matura. Some schools aim to combine the education available at the Gymnasium and the Hauptschule, and are known as Gesamtschulen. In addition, a recognition of the importance of learning English has led some Gymnasiums to offer a bilingual stream, in which pupils deemed able in languages follow a modified curriculum, a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> time being conducted in English.|$|E
50|$|Some schools offer bilingual VWO (Tweetalig VWO, or TVWO), where <b>the</b> {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> {{are taught}} in English. In some schools near the Dutch-German border, pupils may choose a form of TVWO that offers 50% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> in German and 50% in Dutch.|$|R

500|$|The {{grades were}} not kept {{separate}} {{for the entire}} duration of the session. [...] The class began with devotional exercises, led by the superintendent and involving the entire body of pupils. [...] After this, the grades were taught separately. [...] At {{the end of the}} session, the superintendent led, and the whole body participated in, a five-minute review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> followed by closing exercises. [...] This created a challenge for ecclesiastical architects: the Sunday-school building had to be designed {{in such a way that}} the pupils could quickly and efficiently be separated into various grades, and brought together for all-school activities.|$|E
500|$|During the 1820s and 1830s, Sherwood wrote a {{great many}} tracts for the poor; like her novels for the middle class, they [...] "taught the lessons of {{personal}} endurance, reliance on Providence, and acceptance of one's earthly status." [...] Emphasizing individual experience and one's personal relationship with God, they discouraged readers from attributing their successes or failures to [...] "larger economic and political forces." [...] In this, they resembled the Cheap Repository Tracts, {{many of which were}} written by Hannah More. [...] As Linda Peterson, a scholar of nineteenth-century women's literature, argues, Sherwood's tracts use a Biblical [...] "interpretative frame" [...] in order to highlight the fleetingness of earthly things. For example, in A Drive in the Coach through the Streets of London (1819), Julia is granted the privilege of shopping with her mother only if she will [...] "behave wisely in the streets" [...] and [...] "not give [...] mind to self-pleasing." [...] Of course, she cannot keep this promise and she eagerly peeks in at every store window and begs her mother to buy her everything she sees. [...] Her mother therefore allows her to select one item from every shop. Julia, ecstatic, chooses, among other things, blue satin boots, a penknife, and a new hat with flowers, until the pair reach the undertaker's shop. There her mood droops considerably and she realizes the moral <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lesson,</b> recited by her mother, as she picks out a coffin: [...] "but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth" [...] (1 Timothy 5:6).|$|E
500|$|Just before Dwight {{starts his}} fire simulation, {{he said his}} {{co-workers}} previously failed to listen because he made a presentation on the computer program Microsoft PowerPoint, of which he said, [...] "PowerPoint is boring". Michael refers to Barack Obama, the first African American president of the United States, to Stanley while he is suffering a heart attack by shouting, [...] "Stanley! Barack is president! You are black! Stanley!" [...] A deleted scene further addresses Obama's election, with Michael praising the choice and Darryl, with Darryl half-jokingly telling the Caucasian office workers what will change for them (they {{no longer have to}} pretend to like jazz, and Morgan Freeman won't get any more acting work because [...] "he's more for you guys"). Michael calls an employee from the Red Cross, an international humanitarian movement, to conduct a lesson about CPR. The instructor suggests they pump the heart to the tune of [...] "Stayin' Alive", a disco song by the pop band, the Bee Gees, but Michael mixes the song up with [...] "I Will Survive" [...] by Gloria Gaynor. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lesson,</b> Dwight cuts the face off the CPR dummy and places it on his face in the manner of Hannibal Lecter, a fictional cannibalistic serial killer who cut the face off a man and wore it as a mask in the 1991 thriller film, The Silence of the Lambs. Watching Mrs. Albert Hannaday, Andy says the Cloris Leachman character was originally supposed to be played by the much younger actress, Nicole Kidman, and the last-minute replacement prompted a minor overhaul in the film's script. The songs [...] "You Make My Dreams Come True" [...] by Hall and Oates, [...] "All Out of Love" [...] by the soft rock duo Air Supply, [...] "Have a Little Faith in Me" [...] by singer-songwriter John Hiatt, and [...] "Lady" [...] by Little River Band play during scenes in Mrs. Albert Hannaday.|$|E

Christian media consultant Phil Cooke tells the story, conceding that it's fictional, and uses it to demonstrate the importance of the research he reads, and knowing one's audience in particular.

2500|$|The focused {{lesson is}} the first phase in a gradual release of {{responsibility}} model. [...] Other names for this are modeling, direct instruction, explicit instruction, or teacher instructed mini-lessons. [...] This is a powerful, but brief, segment of instruction time as it is when the teacher demonstrates, models, and shares what the teacher, is thinking. [...] The teacher verbalizes their internal thought processes to explain and explicitly show the focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lesson,</b> skills, or concepts. [...] Or the teacher invites the students into their mind to witness their thought process, how it is done and how decisions are made during the task. This {{is not the time}} to simply tell the students things, but to let them know how to do them and why.|$|E
2500|$|With the Dover ruling {{describing}} [...] "teach the controversy" [...] as [...] "at best disingenuous, and {{at worst}} a canard", intelligent design proponents have moved to a fallback position, emphasizing contrived flaws in evolution and overemphasizing remaining questions in the theory {{what they call the}} Critical Analysis of Evolution. The Critical Analysis of Evolution strategy is viewed by Nick Matzke and other intelligent design critics as a means of teaching all the intelligent design arguments without using the intelligent design label. Critical Analysis of Evolution continues the themes of the teach the controversy strategy, emphasizing what they say are the [...] "criticisms" [...] of evolutionary theory and [...] "arguments against evolution," [...] which continues to be portrayed as [...] "a theory in crisis." [...] Early drafts of the critical analysis of evolution lesson plan referred to the lesson as the [...] "great evolution debate"; one of the early drafts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> plan had one section titled [...] "Conducting the Macroevolution Debate". In a subsequent draft, it was changed to [...] "Conducting the Critical Analysis Activity". The wording for the two sections is nearly identical, with just [...] "debate" [...] changed to [...] "critical analysis activity" [...] wherever it appeared, in the manner of how intelligent design proponents simply replaced [...] "creation" [...] with [...] "intelligent design" [...] in Of Pandas and People to repackage a creation science textbook into an intelligent design textbook.|$|E
