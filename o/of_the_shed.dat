25|$|The {{original}} Shed {{was located}} on the hill at the northeast of the ground. The redevelopment of the ground in 2003 led to the relocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shed</b> closer to the playing surface. The Shed {{is home to the}} supporter group, Glory Shed Supporters Club (GSSC).|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Shed's {{building}} is a collaboration between two New York City architectural firms: Diller Scofidio + Renfro and Rockwell Group. The Shed Organization, a nonprofit organization, was formed in 2012 to oversee construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shed,</b> and eventually will run the building when it opens in 2019.|$|E
50|$|Remains {{of timber}} piles {{from the earlier}} wharves are evident in front of No.3 and No.4 <b>sheds.</b> Internally, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheds</b> have timber floors, with No.5 having a {{concrete}} floor. Approximately half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> No.4 <b>shed</b> is built over the river. A concrete roadway runs behind <b>the</b> <b>sheds,</b> with concrete ramps accessing <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheds.</b>|$|R

25|$|Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shed,</b> {{which will}} be over the West Side Yards, began after {{caissons}} were sunk to support a platform over the tracks. The platform supporting the towers, comprising 16 bridges, was completed in late 2014. The construction of the building itself began in mid-2015. The retractable shed was completed by 2017.|$|E
25|$|The {{access line}} to this {{was from the}} western line of the goods yard, and threw off a {{carriage}} siding before bifurcating and running into the shed. There was a short spur parallel to the west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> entrance, which was used for major refits in the open air. Next to this was an open-fronted shed.|$|E
25|$|The {{locomotive}} shed {{was capable of}} holding four locomotives and held an inspection pit. Steam and smoke was carried away from the inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> by a system of wooden troughs hanging suspended from the roof over {{the centre of the}} tracks and leading, sloping upwards, to wooden chimneys. The fumes would otherwise erode the iron roof supports.|$|E

25|$|Construction of the airship {{began on}} 17 June 1898, {{when the first}} {{sections}} of the framework were delivered from Berg's factory and was completed by 27 January 1900. Inflation of the gasbags took place during June and the airship was first taken out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> {{on the evening of}} 2 July, with Hauptmann Hans Bartsch von Sigsfeld of the Prussian Airship Battalion at the controls.|$|E
25|$|Trains {{arrive and}} {{depart from the}} train shed, which {{contains}} 23 platforms (11 island platforms and one side platform) south of the Great Hall. A reconstruction of the trainshed began in January 2010. The east and west sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed,</b> totalling approximately , are being renovated and restored with input from Parks Canada to help preserve its heritage character. This renovation will also see a green roof installed, reducing the urban heat island effect and stormwater runoff. The central portion of the original trainshed, totalling , was removed and replaced with a glass atrium. The structure floats above the tracks, and allows daylight to reach the platforms.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the engine}} and tender were {{successfully}} relocated during the Fall of 1960, it was several more years before the steel shed was erected overhead to protect the locomotive. In addition to the Pine Bluff Jaycees, the City of Pine Bluff and the Pine Bluff Park Commission each donated $500. Pine Bluff Mayor Franks personally donated $250 and another $250 was donated by the Townsend Park Commission. Gene Gardner, an engineer with International Paper, designed the green and white steel shed and drew up the plans for it. International Paper Company and the Pine Bluff Sand & Gravel Company furnished the concrete footings for the shed, while Varco Steel did the construction work. Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> was completed in September 1965 when a chain-link fence was installed and the landscaping was finished.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sheds</b> (Nos 2, 3, 4 and 5) <b>The</b> <b>sheds</b> {{are single}} {{storeyed}} timber framed structures with corrugated steel gable roofs with deep eave overhangs {{on the northern}} and northeastern sides. <b>The</b> No. 4 <b>shed</b> has a double gable roof, and is <b>the</b> longest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group. <b>The</b> <b>sheds</b> have corrugated steel cladding to walls, with large sliding timber doors to <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheds,</b> and openings facing the river which originally provided access from the wharves.|$|R

25|$|Soon after Tunnel 13, Stoney Creek Station is reached, at 22.53km. Within {{a cutting}} a siding {{branches}} {{off the main}} line and runs parallel and {{to the south of}} the main line, rejoining at the west end of the station. A shelter shed with an enclosed office in its south-east corner is located between the siding and the main line. The shed has an earth floor and a hipped roof, and the timber walls and posts are mounted on concrete wall and post bases. The timber framed walls of the office section are single skinned, and are clad with chamferboards. The office has open window frames on the south and west sides, a pivoting timber window to the east side and a timber door on the north side. The main open space <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> has a single skinned timber wall (with a gap above the concrete wall base) on the south side, which has an open window frame.|$|E
25|$|The {{next morning}} during roll call, Mikl√≥s finds Saul {{and tells him}} that he needs a {{replacement}} body, {{similar to the one}} Saul has taken. The prisoners are then summoned into the crematorium to get back to work, where they discover that Biedermann and his unit have been gassed by the SS. Abraham starts a riot with the other prisoners and they attack the SS guards, starting the rebellion. After managing to escape from the crematorium, Saul retrieves the boy's body and escapes to the woods with Braun and few other prisoners. When they reach a river, Saul finds a chance to bury the body, only to discover that Braun is a fraud when he can't recite the Kaddish. When he hears the guards approaching, Saul tries to carry the body across the river. Unable to manage the current with the added weight, he loses his grasp on the sack and is pulled out of the river by Rabbi Frankel as the body floats away. When the prisoners arrive at a shed in the forest, they start to discuss a plan to join the Polish resistance. Saul notices a young peasant boy peeking into the shed and smiles at him, the only time he is shown with a smile. As the boy runs away, guards run past in the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed.</b> Gunfire echoes as the camera follows the boy into the woods.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{than simply}} sneaking Jim out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> {{where he is}} being held, Tom {{develops}} an elaborate plan to free him, involving secret messages, a hidden tunnel, snakes in a shed, a rope ladder sent in Jim's food, and other elements from adventure books he has read, including an anonymous note to the Phelps warning them of the whole scheme. During the actual escape and resulting pursuit, Tom is shot in the leg, while Jim remains by his side, risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone. Although a local doctor admires Jim's decency, he has Jim arrested in his sleep {{and returned to the}} Phelps. After this, events quickly resolve themselves. Tom's Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Huck and Tom's true identities to the Phelps family. Jim is revealed to be a free man: Miss Watson died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will, but Tom (who already knew this) chose not to reveal this information to Huck so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for Jim. Jim tells Huck that Huck's father (Pap Finn) has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house), and so Huck may now return safely to St. Petersburg. Huck is rewarded six hundred dollars for saving the aunts from the con men. Huck gives most of it to Jim for his family. Huck declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story, and despite Sally's plans to adopt and civilize him, he intends to flee west to Indian Territory.|$|E

500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} radical of Shed Light's {{projects}} were two C-123K Provider aircraft modified in September 1965 under Project Black Spot. [...] Black Spot had been in development prior to the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shed</b> Light Task Force, but were subsequently incorporated in under the wide reaching charter. With the scrapping of the AS-2D aircraft program in 1968, the Black Spot aircraft became the prime contenders for Shed Light‚Äôs first phase.|$|E
500|$|The {{semicircle}} of rock {{inside the}} doorsill remind {{the viewer to}} abandon sin. The viewer is reminded to reach {{a full understanding of}} the significance of the event, achieved with the two groupings of shepherds at the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed.</b> Two of the four are active and two are passive. The man dressed in blue on the left is listening; the man in blue to the right is seeing, while their counterparts in red do neither. Although actively looking and listening, the two men in blue do not appear to have a full understanding of the event. Upton explains the medieval viewer would have understood that in the iconography Christus presented [...] "man who would listen without hearing, and look without seeing." [...] The viewer is reminded to comprehend the painting's vision and iconography, to fully recognize the significance of Christ's coming, to hear and see the word of God, and to obey God's wishes.|$|E
500|$|The arch is only {{a prelude}} to the complex {{divisions}} beyond. The space inhabited by the Holy Family is holy ground. Mary, Joseph, the Christ child and the four surrounding angels occupy a space partitioned in the front by the archway and by the wall at the rear. A semicircle of figures is positioned around Christ, echoed in the semicircle of rocks placed directly inside the doorsill. Mary and Joseph are echoed by the colorful vertical porphyry columns on the sides, and by the statues of Adam and Eve. The rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> where the four men stand, the small valley with the shepherds, the town, and the background landscape are also spatially discrete areas, which create a [...] "steady, measured movement into space {{in place of the}} more abrupt jumping from foreground to distant background common to Flemish painting." [...] They also function to surround the Holy Family while simultaneously preventing its isolation from the world. Ainsworth writes that the [...] "message of the painting quietly emerges from the strict, perspectively correct space constructed to engage the viewer." [...] Upton agrees, explaining that the use of geometric devices emphasize the focal point, which [...] "falls well below the horizon in the exact center of the panel", a perspective that would have given the 15th center viewer, kneeling in front of the panel, a [...] "sense of physical relationship between the actual and ideal act of worship." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{suspected}} arson {{damaged the}} goods shed in February 1984.

[...] The remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shed</b> sold for removal on 13 June 1984 with the work completed in August.|$|E
2500|$|In 1876 {{the engine}} shed was {{extended}} to take two larger engines rather than one small one, the extension was carefully matched to the original building, apart from {{a difference in the}} cast-iron window frames.

2500|$|The shed {{has drawn}} mixed public reviews, {{as well as}} high praise from {{numerous}} art institutions. In an editorial for the art website Artsy, one writer stated that although [...] "the building's innovative architecture seems ready to withstand the weight of [...] grand ambitions", the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shed</b> also had the unforeseen side effect of [...] "making New York ever less accessible for those without financial means", considering the poor neighborhoods located close to Hudson Yards.|$|E
