40|$|In {{this body}} of work, several single-pixel imaging {{applications}} are presented, based on structured light manipulation via a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) and a single element photodetector (PD). This {{is commonly known as}} computational single-pixel imaging, and is achieved by using the measurements made by the PD to weight a series of projected structured light-fields. This indicates the strength of correlation between each light-field, and some object or scene placed in its propagation path. After many iterations the ensemble average of the weighted structured light-field converges to the object. Historically, computational single-pixel imaging has suffered from long image acquisition times and low resolution. Inhibiting the ability of physical systems from competing with conventional imaging in any form. Advances in computer and DMD technology have opened new avenues of research for this novel imaging technique. These advances have been utilised in this work by creating fast acquisition demonstrator systems, which have real world applications, such as multi-wavelength, polarisation, and long-range imaging. Several PDs were added to allow for simultaneous measurement of multiple images in the desired application. For multi-wavelength, RGB and white light illumination was spectrally filtered on three detectors to create full-colour images. While conversely the same multi-detector approach allowed for simultaneous measurement of <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> states essential to Stokes' parameter image reconstruction. Differential projection of the structured light-fields further allowed for the single-pixel camera to compensate from some sources of real world noise, such as background illumination. This work demonstrates an evolution of the single-pixel camera. From a system capable of only imaging simple, binary transmissive objects twice per hour and constrained to an optical bench, to a semi portable camera, capable of multiple frames per second 2 D reconstructions of 3 D scenes over a range of 20 kilometres. These improvements in capability cement the idea that the single-pixel camera is now a viable alternate imaging technology...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to perform {{observational}} tests of SiO maser polarisation and excitation models, using component-level comparisons of multiple SiO maser transitions in the 43 GHz and 86 GHz bands at milliarcsecond resolution. These observations require very long baseline interferometric imaging with very accurate plarimetric calibration. The supergiant star VY CMa {{was chosen as the}} object of this study due to its high SiO maser luminosity, many detected SiO maser lines, and intrinsic scientific interest. Two epochs of full-polarisation VLBA observations of VY CMa were performed. The Epoch 2 observations were reduced using several new data reducation methods developed as part of this work, and designed specifically to improve the accuracy of circular polarisation calibration of spectral-line VLBI observations at millimetre wavelengths. The accuracy is estimated to be better than 1 % using these methods. The Epoch 2 images show a concentration of v= 1 and v= 2 J= 1 - 0 SiO masers to the east and northeast of the assumed stellar position. The v= 1 J= 2 - 1 masers were more evenly distributed around the star, with a notable lack of emission in the northeast. There is appreciable spatial overlap between these three lines. The nature ofthe overlap is generally consistent with the predictions of hydrodynamical circumstellar SiO maser simulations. Where the v= 1 J= 1 - 0 and J= 2 - 1 features overlap, the v= 1 J= 2 - 1 emission is usually considerably weaker. This is not predicted by current hydrodynamical models, but can be explained in the context of collisional pumping in a low density environment. six observational tests of weak-splitting maser polarisation models were performed, including inter-comparisons of <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> in the v= 1 J= 1 - 0 and J= 2 - 1 lines, <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> versus saturation level, <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> versus distance from the star, circular polarisation in the v= 1 J= 1 - 0 and J= 2 - 1 lines, circular versus <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> and modeling of ~ 90 ° electric-vector position angle rotations. The polarisation model tests generally do not support non-Zeeman circular polarisation mechanisms. For the <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> tests, the results are more consistent with models that predict similar <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> across transitions.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the regularized <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> {{discriminant}} analysis (ROLDA) is studied. The major {{issue of the}} regularized linear discriminant analysis is to choose an appropriate regularization parameter. In existing regularized linear discriminant analysis methods, they all select the best regularization parameter from a given parameter candidate set by using cross-validation for classification. An obvious limitation of such regularized linear discriminant analysis methods {{is that it is}} not clear how to choose an appropriate candidate set. Therefore, up to now, there is no concrete mathematical theory available in selecting an appropriate regularization parameter in practical applications of the regularized linear discriminant analysis. The present work is to fill this gap. Here we derive the mathematical relationship between <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> discriminant analysis and the regularized <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> discriminant analysis first, and then by means of this relationship we find a mathematical criterion for selecting the regularization parameter in ROLDA and consequently we develop a new regularized <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> discriminant analysis method, in which no candidate set of regularization parameter is needed.

Aims. We sought to test whether the quiet Sun flux detected by Hinode is due to a local or the global dynamo by studying long-term variations in the polarisation signals detectable at the disc centre of the quiet Sun between November 2006 and May 2012, with particular emphasis on weak signals in the internetwork. Methods. The investigation focusses on line-integrated circular <b>polarisation</b> Vtot and <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> LPtot profiles obtained from the Fe I 6302. 5 Å absorption line in Hinode SOT/SP. Results. Both circular and <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> signals show no overall variation in the fraction of selected pixels from 2006 until 2012. There is also no variation in the magnetic flux in this interval of time. The probability density functions (PDF) of the line-of-sight magnetic flux can be fitted with a power law from 1. 17 × 1017 Mx to 8. 53 × 1018 Mx with index α = − 1. 82 ± 0. 02 in 2007. The variation of α’s across all years does not exceed a significance of 1 σ. Linearly polarised features are also fitted with a power law, with index α = − 2. 60 ± 0. 06 in 2007.

The low temperature photoluminescence spectra from both sets of samples are very broad with full width at half-maximum height increasing from 81 to 330 meV as the In fraction increases. Comparative photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy indicates that the recombination mainly involves strongly localised carriers. At a temperature of 10 K the degree of <b>linear</b> <b>polarisation</b> of the a-plane samples is much smaller than of the m-plane counterparts and also varies across the spectrum.
