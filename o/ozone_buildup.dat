40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of wintertime <b>ozone</b> <b>buildup</b> over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) midlatitudes and its {{connection with the}} mean meridional circulation in the stratosphere are examined statistically {{on a monthly basis}} from October to March (1980 ? 2002). The <b>ozone</b> <b>buildup</b> begins locally in October with positive ozone tendencies over the North Pacific, which spread eastward and westward in November and finally cover all midlatitudes in December. During October?January a longitudinal distribution of the ozone tendencies mirrors a structure of quasi-stationary planetary waves in the lower stratosphere and has less similarity with this structure in February?March when chemistry begins to play a more important role. From November to March, zonal mean ozone tendencies (50 °? 60 ° N) show strong correlation (|r|= 0. 7) with different parameters used as proxies of the mean meridional circulation, namely: eddy heat flux, the vertical residual velocity (diabatically-derived) and temperature tendency. The correlation patterns between ozone tendency and the vertical residual velocity or temperature tendency are more homogeneous from month to month than ones for eddy heat flux. A partial exception is December when correlation is strong only for the vertical residual velocity. In October zonal mean ozone tendencies have no coupling with the proxies. However, positive tendencies averaged over the North Pacific correlate well, with all of them suggesting that intensification of northward ozone transport starts locally over the Pacific already in October. We show that the NH midlatitude <b>ozone</b> <b>buildup</b> has stable statistical relation with the mean meridional circulation in all months from October to March and half of the interannual variability in monthly ozone tendencies can be explained by applying different proxies of the mean meridional circulation...|$|E

The local onset of the buildup in October is not evident in zonal mean ozone tendency, which is close to zero. From November to March, zonal mean total ozone tendency (50 °– 60 ° N) shows a strong correlation (|r|= 0. 7) with several zonal mean parameters associated to the mean meridional circulation, namely: eddy heat flux, temperature tendency, the vertical residual velocity and the residual streamfunction. At the same time, on the latitude-altitude cross section, correlation patterns between ozone tendency and widely used eddy heat flux are not uniform during winter. The strongest correlations are located equatorward (almost throughout the stratosphere) or poleward (only in the lower stratosphere) of the edge of the polar vortex. Such distribution may depend on the existence of the midlatitude and polar waveguides which defined refraction of upward propagating waves from the troposphere either to the midlatitude stratosphere or to the polar stratosphere. As a consequence of the nonuniform correlation patterns, heat flux averaged over the common region 45 °– 75 ° N, 100 hPa is not always an optimum proxy for statistical models describing total ozone variability in midlatitudes. Other parameters approximating the strength of the mean meridional circulation have more uniform and stable correlation patterns with ozone tendency during winter. We show that the NH midlatitude <b>ozone</b> <b>buildup</b> has a stable statistical relationship with the mean meridional circulation in all months from October to March and half of the interannual variability in monthly ozone tendencies can be explained by applying different proxies of the mean meridional circulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of ozone below 60 km altitude has been simulated in two experiments employing a nine-layer quasi-geostrophic spectral model and linear parameterization of ozone photochemistry, {{the first of}} which included thermal and orographic forcing of the planetary scale waves, while the second omitted it. The first experiment exhibited a high latitude winter <b>ozone</b> <b>buildup</b> which was due to a Brewer-Dodson circulation forced by large amplitude (planetary scale) waves in the winter lower stratosphere.

The annual cycle of ozone transports in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres is presented and discussed.

40|$|Temporal autocorrelations of monthly mean {{total ozone}} {{anomalies}} over the 35 – 60 °S and 35 – 60 °N latitude bands reveal that anomalies established in the wintertime midlatitude <b>ozone</b> <b>buildup</b> persist (with photochemical decay) {{until the end of}} the following autumn, and then are rapidly erased once the next winter's buildup begins. The photochemical decay rate is found to be identical between the two hemispheres. High predictability of ozone through late summer exists based on the late-spring values. In the northern hemisphere, extending the 1979 – 2001 springtime ozone trend to other months through regression based on the seasonal persistence of anomalies captures the seasonality of the ozone trends remarkably well. In the southern hemisphere, the springtime trend only accounts for part of the summertime trends. There is a strong correlation between the ozone anomalies in northern hemisphere spring and those in the subsequent southern hemisphere spring, but not the converse...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} large field {{experiments}} (for example, SAFARI- 92, SAFARI- 2000) have been undertaken {{in the last decade}} or so over southern Africa. Routine ozone profiling as part of the SHADOZ ozonesonde network takes place at Irene and Nairobi, and aircraft measurements in the MOZAIC programme have contributed both upper tropospheric data and profile data at selected airports. All have highlighted the build-up of tropospheric ozone over central and southern Africa and hence support the notion of a giant natural photochemical reactor over the region. Attention is drawn in the first instance to the spatial and temporal features of the ozone enhancement. It is shown that there is a strong latitudinal gradient in total tropospheric ozone, with peak values experienced over Zambia, and a longitudinal migration of the season of peak ozone from west to east. Back trajectory analysis from 11 data stations support the dynamic prerequisites for <b>ozone</b> <b>buildup</b> (viz. anticyclonic recirculation), which when coupled with ozone production from a rich and diverse mixture of sources (fires, lightning, urban-industrial, biogenic) provide all the ingredients for ozone enhancment and support the notion of a giant natural photochemical reactor.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the effects of electron beam pulse parameters on the utilization of the reactive free radicals for removal of NO{sub x} from diesel generator exhaust. A dose per pulse less than 1 kGy has been determined to be optimum for effective radical utilization. During each post-pulse period, the radicals are utilized in the removal of NO{sub x} in a timescale of around 100 microseconds; thus, with pulse frequencies of around 10 kHz or less, the radical concentrations remain sufficiently low to prevent any significant competition between radical-pollutant and radical-radical reactions. It is shown that a pulsed electron beam reactor, operating with a dose per pulse of less than 1 kGy/pulse and pulse repetition rate of less than 10 kHz, will have the same plasma chemistry efficiency (parts per million of removed NO{sub x} per kGy of electron beam dose) as an electron beam reactor operating with a low dose rate of 50 kGy/s in continuous mode. Ozone accumulation is a limiting factor under high pulse frequency conditions. The total dose requirement determines the optimum combination of dose per pulse and pulse frequency for both radical utilization and prevention of <b>ozone</b> <b>buildup...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Tropospheric ozone {{enhancements}} {{were measured}} over Hong Kong (22. 2 ø N, 114. 3 øE) by electrochemical concentration cell ozonesondes during the 1997 period when many forest fires were burning in Indonesia. The enhancements have a {{maximum ozone concentration}} of up to 130 ppbv and an ozone-enhanced layer depth of 10 km. We used Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer, advanced very high resolution radiometer satellite image, and back air trajectory to identify the source region and the transport pattern of ozone. The strong tropospheric ozone enhancements covered all of tropical Southeast Asia and subtropical south China. They were due to photochemical <b>ozone</b> <b>buildup</b> from the biomass burning emissions from the Indonesian fires. The ozone-rich air mass was transported to Hong Kong following the east Asia local Hadley circulation and an abnormal anticyclonic flow related to the E 1 Nifio phenomenon in the tropical western Pacific. A rough estimation of the radiative forcing due to the ozone enhancement was carried out for two cases in October and December in 1997 using a normalized tropospheric ozone radiative forcing parameter derived from the Unified Chemistry-Climate model [Mickley et al., 1999]. The ozone enhancements induced- 2 an additional radiative forcing of 0. 26 and 0. 48 Wm compared to the normal total forcing of 0. 48 and 0. 39 Wm- 2 in October and December over the Hong Kong region. Estimation f the associated surface temperature change suggests that enhanced ozone from biomass burning {{on the scale of}} the 1997 Indonesian fires may have significant impact on regional surface temperature change...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{observed}} ozone {{profiles in}} Northern Hemisphere low and middle latitudes reveals the seasonal persistence of ozone anomalies {{in both the}} lower and upper stratosphere. Principal component analysis is used to detect that above 16 hPa the persistence is strongest in the latitude band 15 – 45 °N, while below 16 hPa the strongest persistence is found over 45 – 60 °N. In both cases, ozone anomalies persist through the entire year from November to October. The persistence of ozone anomalies in the lower stratosphere is presumably related to the wintertime <b>ozone</b> <b>buildup</b> with subsequent photochemical relaxation through summer, as previously found for total ozone. The persistence in the upper stratosphere is more surprising, given the short lifetime of Ox at these altitudes. It is hypothesized that this “seasonal memory” in the upper stratospheric ozone anomalies arises from the seasonal persistence of transport-induced wintertime NOy anomalies, which then perturb the ozone chemistry {{throughout the rest of}} the year. This hypothesis is confirmed by analysis of observations of NO 2, NOx, and various long-lived trace gases in the upper stratosphere, which are found to exhibit the same seasonal persistence. Previous studies have attributed much of the year-to-year variability in wintertime extratropical upper stratospheric ozone to the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) through transport-induced NOy (and hence NO 2) anomalies but have not identified any statistical connection between the QBO and summertime ozone variability. Our results imply that through this “seasonal memory,” the QBO has an asynchronous effect on ozone in the low to midlatitude upper stratosphere during summer and early autumn...|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} numerical {{simulations of}} surface ozone mixing ratios {{over the south}} Asian region during the pre-monsoon season, employing three different emission inventories in the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) with the second-generation Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM 2) chemical mechanism: the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research – Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (EDGAR-HTAP), the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment phase B (INTEX-B) and the Southeast Asia Composition, Cloud, Climate Coupling Regional Study (SEAC 4 RS). Evaluation of diurnal variability in modelled ozone compared to observational data from 15 monitoring stations across south Asia shows the model ability to reproduce the clean, rural and polluted urban conditions over this region. In contrast to the diurnal average, the modelled ozone mixing ratios during noontime, i. e. hours of intense photochemistry (11 : 30 – 16 : 30  IST – Indian Standard Time – UTC + 5 : 30), are found to differ among the three inventories. This suggests that evaluations of the modelled ozone limited to 24  h average are insufficient to assess uncertainties associated with <b>ozone</b> <b>buildup.</b> HTAP generally shows 10 – 30  ppbv higher noontime ozone mixing ratios than SEAC 4 RS and INTEX-B, especially over the north-west Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), central India and southern India. The HTAP simulation repeated with the alternative Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers (MOZART) chemical mechanism showed even more strongly enhanced surface ozone mixing ratios due to vertical mixing of enhanced ozone that has been produced aloft. Our study indicates the need to also evaluate the O 3 precursors across a network of stations {{and the development of}} high-resolution regional inventories for the anthropogenic emissions over south Asia accounting for year-to-year changes to further reduce uncertainties in modelled ozone over this region...|$|E
