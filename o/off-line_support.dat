In this thesis, my objectives are to investigate and report on the major issues and challenges that impact the future success of Japan's public e-marketplaces, as well as to identify critical success factors. I conducted interviews with representatives of eight e-marketplaces in different industries. In those interviews, I learned that the unique characteristics of Japan's business environment, such as intermediates, Keiretsu-based business, and delays in the penetration of IT into small and medium-size enterprises, have had a major influence on the development of Japan's public e-marketplaces. Moreover, since it is customary for companies that try to change their internal business processes to encounter resistance and political pressure from both inside and outside companies, the e-marketplaces must expend an extraordinary amount of company effort and time to achieve success. The following are the key critical success factors I identified during the interviews: * take an honest and sound approach; * respect traditional business practices; * offer value-added services that benefit customers; * offer <b>off-line</b> customer <b>support</b> as well as on-line services; * develop an effective alliance strategy. I believe these critical success factors are fairly universal, and could be equally useful in the public e-marketplaces of Japan's other industries. by Takayuki Mizuno. Thesis (S. M. M. O. T.)

The phonotactics of the language {{as well as the}} data of an <b>off-line</b> experimental task <b>support</b> a preference for the preservation of affricates over stop+/s / over /s/+stop clusters and all other clusters. A strong tendency {{of the participants in the}} experiment was to break up clusters by inserting a vowel while they retained almost all affricates intact. This linguistic behavior is attributed, first, to the identity of place of articulation of the consonants being members of the clusters and, second, to the (degree of) satisfaction of the scale of consonantal strength. Affricates tend to exhibit a limited degree of decomposition; stop+/s / clusters exhibit a relative degree of decomposition, /s/+stop clusters undergo and even higher degree of decomposition while other cluster types are decomposed massively.

Grabner and Bischof (2006) propose an on-line features selected visual tracking method by using Adboost algorithm to select features on line. Soon afterwards, Grabner et al.

The project TEMPUS — ECOMMIS («double-level training programs of e-commerce developing the information society in Russia, Ukraine and Israel») was launched in October 2011, and belongs to a class of joint projects to develop new courses and courses for bachelor’s and master’s degrees. The project consortium involves 12 universities from Germany, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Israel, Russia and Ukraine. The main objective of the project is to develop and implement new academic courses and areas of study, taking into account the current status and trends of economic development and the specific requirements of the labor market on the basis of cooperation between universities in different countries. The main feature and complexity of the project academic content of is that e-commerce as an academic concept is absolute new and it appeared just only in the last decade. It is a new interdisciplinary field of knowledge, which is located at the intersection of economics and computer science and it is not covered by the classical training courses in economics and computer science technology. The aspects of national and international law in connection with the growth of international trade, economic cooperation and the development of new Internet based technologies should be taken into account. For the project’s period of three years on the basis of international cooperation the following results were obtained: 11 Preface 1) The analysis and modernization of existing curricula in the field of e-commerce were carried out; 2) new training modules with the introduction of the European creditmodular system of accumulation and transfer transcripts units (ECTS) were developed; new modules and courses: e-commerce, electronic payment systems; Internet trading in the financial markets and the stockmarket systems; Information systems for financial analysis and investment; Information systems for business process modeling; corporate information systems and portals; Customer-oriented systems; Internet Marketing; electronic systems for document management; legal aspects of e-commerce; advanced course security for e-commerce were introduced; 3) two international online games to enhance practical skills in the field with online marketing and online trading were developed and conducted among university students; 4) skills training courses e-commerce for various social groups (students, housewives, pensioners, unemployed) were developed and tested; 5) business offices, e-commerce were established to strengthen cooperation between the universities in the labor market and to create the conditions of commercialization of the project results after the end of financial support from the TEMPUS Program. 6) textbooks on the topic of the project were developed and published. In May — July 2013. 62 teachers targeted universities in Israel, Russia and Ukraine received intensive training in the field of e-commerce in three European universities: FONTYS (NL), TU Berlin (DE), VGTU (LT). From October 2013 in target universities of Israel, Russia and Ukraine students’ training began on the courses developed in the framework of the new training courses and modules with using computer classes, equipped in accordance with the project plan with new hardware and software tools. The final stage of the project was intended to develop a five-year detailed plan for sustainable development of the results. Such plan that includes coordinated action to disseminate best practices, development of new joint courses for graduate and post-graduate students, scientificmethodical conferences, joint publications will support the further dynamics of the activities involved universities. Joint work on the implementation of the project ECOMMIS led to the emergence of sustainable professional relationships between organizations in the consortium as the training of new qualified professionals, {{as well as in the}} field of scientific and methodological developments. This is confirmed by the present collective monograph E-commerc...|$|E
40|$|Rapid eye {{movement}} (REM) sleep {{has been considered}} a paradoxical state because, despite the high behavioral threshold to arousing perturbations, gross physiological patterns in the forebrain resemble those of waking states. To understand how intrahippocampal networks interact during REM sleep, we used 96 site silicon probes to record from different hippocampal subregions and compared the patterns of activity during waking exploration and REM sleep. Dentate/CA 3 theta and gamma synchronywas significantly higher during REMsleepcomparedwithactivewaking. In contrast, gammapower inCA 1 andCA 3 –CA 1 gammacoherence showedsignificantdecreases in REM sleep. Changes in unit firing rhythmicity and unit-field coherence specified the local generation of these patterns. Although these patternsofhippocampalnetwork coordination characterized themore common tonicperiodsofREMsleep (95 %of totalREM),wealso detected large phasic bursts of local field potential power in the dentatemolecular layer that were accompanied by transient increases in the firing of dentate and CA 1 neurons. In contrast to tonic REM periods, phasic REM epochs were characterized by higher theta and gamma synchrony among the dentate, CA 3, and CA 1 regions. These data suggest enhanced dentate processing, but limited CA 3 –CA 1 coordination during tonic REM sleep. In contrast, phasic bursts of activity during REM sleep may provide windows of opportunity to synchronize the hippocampal trisynaptic loop and increase output to cortical targets. We hypothesize that tonic REM sleepmay <b>support</b> <b>off-line</b> mnemonic processing, whereas phasic bursts of activity during REMmay promote memory consolidation.

40|$|Secure Information Sharing (SIS) or “share but protect ” is a {{challenging}} and elusive problem {{both because of}} its broad scope and complexity ranging right from conception (objective and policy) to culmination (implementation). In this paper, we consider how to solve SIS challenges with three main and conflicting objectives: scalability, usability and high-assurance. In the context of SIS, high-assurance requires strong controls on the client. It is widely accepted that such controls cannot be entirely software-based. In this regard, we consider solutions based on commercially emerging hardware-rooted Trusted Computing Technology. For SIS, we argue super-distribution (“protect once and access wherever authorized”) and off-line access are necessary to achieve scalability and usability. As we will see, although a Trusted Platform Module [1] (TPM) provides a range of powerful functionalities, it does not enable true super-distribution in any obvious manner. We therefore limit super-distribution to occur within a group. A group is an abstract set of TPM-enabled machines. For simplicity, we assume all content that are distributed to be readonly. Drilling down, we propose concrete Policy, Enforcement and Implementation (PEI) models for SIS within a group (group-based SIS or g-SIS). In the policy layer, we develop a framework for specifying subject and object group membership. In the enforcement layer, we explore ways to approximate instant and preemptive revocation of group members to <b>support</b> <b>off-line</b> access. We use the UCON [9] model to formally specify the policy and enforcement models. In the implementation layer, we outline protocols using Trusted Computing Technology [1] that would realize our policy model and thereby our objectives. We also demonstrate {{the value of this}} layered approach by showing how our enforcement and implementation models can easily accommodate enhancements in the policy model. 1...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates how {{prosodic}} phrasing influences listeners 2 ̆ 7 {{interpretation of}} scopally ambiguous wh-questions in Japanese. It focuses on sentences {{such as that}} in (1), in which the wh-phrase can take either embedded or matrix scope: (1) [CP[IPJohn-wa [CP Mary-ga nani-o katta-ka] kikimasita]-ka]?John-TOP Mary-NOM what-ACC bought-Q askedQ‘Did John ask what Mary bought?’ (Embedded scope) or ‘What did John ask whether Mary bought?’ (Matrix scope) ^ I argue that the comprehension of the wh-phrase is guided by the prosodic phrasing of the sentence, as specified in the Scope Prosody Correspondence in (2) : (2) Scope Prosody Correspondence (SPC). The scope of a term X should not extend beyond the Major (phonological) Phrase (MaP) containing X. ^ The SPC predicts {{that there is a}} strong bias for an embedded scope interpretation when a MaP boundary appears after the embedded Q-marker in (1). Without such a prosodic boundary, the SPC predicts that both embedded and matrix scope interpretations are equally available. The results of <b>off-line</b> comprehension experiments <b>supported</b> these predictions of the SPC. They also indicated that that prosodic phrasing rather than pitch compression is the primary determinant of listeners 2 ̆ 7 scope assignments. In addition, it was shown that an embedded scope interpretation was induced by the prosodic boundary at the embedded Q-marker, not by the focus interpretation of the matrix verb. ^ Further experiments showed that the SPC also applies to unambiguous wh-questions and to other sentences containing negative polarity items or quantifiers (e. g., interaction between negation and negative polarity sika, relative scope of quantifiers), but not to sentences lacking scope-relevant items. These results suggest that the SPC is not a construction specific principle effective only in wh-questions but rather a general principle that listeners use when they process sentences containing all and only scope relevant items. ^ Finally, speakers of Tokyo Japanese sometimes inserted a MaP boundary after the embedded Q-marker, and sometimes didn 2 ̆ 7 t, for both scope interpretations of the wh-phrase. In contrast to the comprehension results, in production, the presence of a prosodic boundary after the embedded Q-marker was not reserved for embedded questions except when the two structures were explicitly compared. ...|$|R
