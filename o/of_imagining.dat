5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} <b>of</b> <b>imagining</b> {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when {{they are forced to}} return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E

25|$|James Mensch {{provided}} an understanding <b>of</b> <b>imagining</b> {{the experiences of}} others (what can also be called empathic envisioning) and what that might look like {{when he talked about}} literary imagination humans: the capacity of humans to imagine the experiences of characters in novels. Mensch explained that human beings' embodiment provides them with the capacity to imagine these experiences and then relate to them through empathy. For Mensch, people are only capable of having experiences because of and through their body. Humans (Dasein) experience life, others, the world, etc. via their bodies which can taste, smell, hear, feel, and see. More to the point, their bodies encapsulate our various mental faculties required for processing and retaining those experiences. This means human experiences are experiences of the body. Relating to others then is when two bodies experience one another: they inter-relate. Because humans (Dasein) hold their bodily experiences in their memory, they are able to use our literary imagination to envision the experiences of characters in novels.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Dulaney Jr. of Maryland, {{likewise}} {{observed that}} attempting to tax subjects on the inequitable basis of 'virtual' representation was unsound because, The {{situation of the}} non-electors in England — their capacity to become electors — their inseparable connection {{with those who are}} electors, and their representatives — their security against oppression resulting from this connection, and the necessity <b>of</b> <b>imagining</b> a double or virtual representation, to avoid iniquity and absurdity, have been explained — the inhabitants of the colonies are, as such, incapable of being electors, the privilege of election being exerciseable only in person, and therefore if every inhabitant of America had the requisite freehold, not one could vote, but upon the supposition of his ceasing to be an inhabitant of America, and becoming a resident of Great-Britain, a supposition which would be impertinent, because it shifts the question — should the colonies not be taxed by parliamentary impositions, their respective legislatures have a regular, adequate, and constitutional authority to tax them, and, therefore, there would not necessarily be an iniquitous and absurd exemption, from their not being represented by the House of Commons. There is not that intimate and inseparable relation between the electors of Great-Britain, and the inhabitants of the colonies, which must inevitably involve both in the same taxation; on the contrary, not a single actual elector in England might be immediately affected by a taxation in America, imposed by a statute which would have a general operation and effect, upon the properties of the inhabitants of the colonies. The latter might be oppressed in a thousand shapes, without any sympathy, or exciting any alarm in the former. Moreover, even acts, oppressive and injurious to the colonies in an extreme degree, might become popular in England, from the promise or expectation, that the very measures which depressed the colonies, would give ease to the inhabitants of Great-Britain.|$|E

[...] Uzanne's literary output {{in the early twentieth century}} declined to minor journal articles and inexpensive editions in cheap-format books; for example, his 1902 book L'art et les artifices de la beauté only contained illustrations in black and white.

500|$|Pausch based {{the lecture}} on the generic [...] "Last Lecture" [...] given by some professors, and on the idea <b>of</b> <b>imagining</b> what one would say and what one would want their legacy to be if they could only have one last chance to share their {{knowledge}} with the world. Carnegie Mellon had previously had a lecture series titled the [...] "Last Lecture", but had renamed the series to [...] "Journeys", and had staff talk about their professional experiences. Pausch was offered the lecture around {{the time when he}} was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and had just received the news that he only had a few months left to live after his unsuccessful treatment for the tumors. Pausch nearly cancelled the lecture due to the terminal cancer, but discussed the issue with his wife and decided to take the one final chance to share his thoughts with the world. Pausch compared it to the final scene of The Natural, in which Roy Hobbs (the main character) overcomes injury and old age to hit one final home run.|$|E
500|$|Following Vane's move to Scilly, the Cavalier Parliament {{passed a}} {{resolution}} in November 1661 demanding {{his return to the}} Tower for trial. [...] Charles temporized, and in January 1662 the Parliament renewed the demand. [...] Vane was moved back to the Tower in April 1662, and on 2 June 1662 he was arraigned on charges of high treason against Charles II. [...] The trial began on 6 June before the Court of King's Bench, with four judges headed by Lord Chief Justice Robert Foster presiding, and with the king's attorney general Sir Geoffrey Palmer prosecuting. [...] As was typical of those accused of treason, Vane was denied legal representation. [...] He defended himself against charges of making war against the king during the civil war by asserting the sovereign power of parliament. [...] Accused <b>of</b> <b>imagining</b> the death of the king in 1659, he argued that {{it was not possible to}} commit treason against a king not in possession of the crown. [...] When the prosecution argued that the king was always in de jure possession, Vane pointed out that this rendered invalid the charges that he conspired to keep Charles II from exercising his power. [...] The judges stepped in to point out this was irrelevant. [...] The jury, which was packed with royalists, convicted him after thirty minutes of debate.|$|E

2500|$|As a child, Cosmatos frequented a {{video store}} named Video Addict. During these trips he would browse the horror film section {{looking at the}} boxes {{although}} he {{was not allowed to}} watch such films. During such times he would instead imagine what the film was. He would later reflect upon this experience when making Black Rainbow where one of his goals was [...] "to create a film that is a sort <b>of</b> <b>imagining</b> of an old film that doesn’t exist." [...] The year 1983 was chosen for the story as it's the first year he went to Video Addict. Additionally he thought the idea of setting such a film one year before 1984 was funny. The film's genesis was an overlap between two projects Cosmatos wanted to do. One of these was a film about a girl trapped in an asylum while the other was an installation promoting a research facility that didn't exist. Eventually Cosmatos realized that he could use both ideas in the same project.|$|E
