25|$|Andrews was {{reportedly}} last seen by John Stewart, a steward on the ship, at approximately 2:10a.m., {{ten minutes before}} the Titanic sank into the Atlantic. Andrews was standing alone in the first-class smoking room staring at a painting, Plymouth Harbour, above the fireplace, arms folded <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> his lifejacket lying on a nearby table. The painting depicted the entrance to Plymouth Sound, which Titanic had been expected to visit on her return voyage.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{boundary}} of the ship, archaeologists discovered the fragmentary remains of a man, including pieces of an arm bone and teeth. He had been buried with grave goods including a shield, placed <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> and a sword and a spear lying by his side, besides an axe, a knife, a bronze ring-pin from Ireland, items of pottery, a whetstone from Norway and apparently a drinking horn, of which only a bronze fitting survives. Dozens of other iron fragments were discovered but {{have not yet been}} identified.|$|E
2500|$|Descriptions and {{portraits of}} Leonardo combine {{to create an}} image {{of a man who was}} tall, {{athletic}} and extremely handsome. He was at least [...] tall, the length of his skeleton. Portraits indicate that as an older man, he wore his hair long, at a time when most men wore it cropped short, or reaching to the shoulders. [...] While most men were shaven or wore close-cropped beards, Leonardo's beard flowed <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, {{their second}} album, Fun House, was released, {{featuring}} {{the addition of}} saxophonist Steve Mackay. On June 13 of that year, television recorded the band at the Cincinnati Pop Festival. While performing the songs [...] "T.V. Eye" [...] and [...] "1970", Pop leapt into the crowd, where he was hoisted up on people's hands, and proceeded to smear peanut butter all <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> In a broadcast interview at WNUR Northwestern University radio station in Evanston, Illinois in 1984, Stiv Bators of the Lords of the New Church and the Dead Boys confirmed the long-standing rumor that {{it was he who}} had provided the peanut butter, having carried a large tub from his home in Youngstown, OH and handing it up to Iggy from the audience.|$|E
2500|$|Larry {{proposed}} to Bambi in the Bahamas. [...] He surprised her by getting her name tattooed in circus letters on his chest. [...] When he {{showed it to}} her he said, [...] "You know, you only have one girl's name tattooed over your heart in a lifetime." [...] They had a circus themed wedding at Coney Island (Coney Island was where they were both involved with the sideshow. [...] She performed as [...] "Bambi the Mermaid", and Larry's act involved lying {{on a bed of}} nails while large blocks of ice would be broken <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> by a girl with a sledgehammer; or she would stand on his stomach. [...] The experience performing in front of audiences helped prepare Larry for his later appearances on camera and performing at bike shows). [...] Larry's marriage to Bambi gave him a lot of strength, and gave him something to believe in.|$|E
2500|$|Penny {{proposes that}} it was the [...] "studio model" [...] kept in Venice when the Prado version was sent to Madrid, and {{including}} minor improvements to the composition, which can then be seen being followed in later versions (of the Prado type), that were made by copying it. [...] These would include the Getty, Lausanne and Rome versions, which have the main features in sufficiently identical positions to the London version to have been traced from it, which would not have worked from the Prado version. But the composition continued to develop and there are details and similarities between the Prado and London versions which are not shared by others. [...] These include the following: Adonis has no undergarment covering his shoulder and upper arm (to the right); Venus does not sit on a white cloth; the mouth of the vessel faces away from the viewer. [...] Conversely, examples of details not in the Prado version, but in the London and other versions are the string of pearls in Venus' hair, and a larger gap between Adonis' face and the strap <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E

60|$|But {{the hard}} lesson learned {{early in life}} stood him in good stead. He crossed <b>his</b> arms <b>over</b> <b>his</b> broad <b>chest</b> and anon <b>his</b> well-shaped hand went up to his {{moustache}} and it almost {{seemed as if the}} slender fingers smoothed away the traces of that wave of wrath which had swept over him so unaccountably just now, and only left upon his face those lines of mockery and of good-humour which a nature redolent of sunshine had rendered indelible.|$|R
60|$|Norman Douglas {{was rather}} a fine-looking personage in his way. He had {{a sweep of}} long red beard <b>over</b> <b>his</b> broad <b>chest</b> and a mane of red hair, ungrizzled by the years, on his massive head. His high, white {{forehead}} was unwrinkled and his blue eyes could flash still with all the fire of his tempestuous youth. He could be very amiable when he liked, and he could be very terrible. Poor Faith, so anxiously bent on retrieving the situation {{in regard to the}} church, had caught him in one of his terrible moods.|$|R

6000|$|The prudent Davidson sought {{shelter in}} the nearest darkened room. In the {{artificial}} dusk, beyond the levels of shrouded billiard-tables, a white form heaved up from two chairs on which it had been extended. The middle of the day, table d'hote tiffin once over, was Schomberg's easy time. He lounged out, portly, deliberate, on the defensive, the great fair beard like a cuirass <b>over</b> <b>his</b> manly <b>chest.</b> He did not like Davidson, never a very faithful client of his.

He was at Wells Restaurant in Harlem shortly before 2 a.m., and the waitress had just served him coffee, a chicken leg, and hominy grits, when he keeled <b>over</b> clutching <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> Childhood friend Finley Hoskins was there, and someone ran down the street to the Rhythm Club to get another childhood friend, Junie Byrd. When Byrd arrived, he cradled Bumpy in his arms, and Johnson briefly opened his eyes and smiled, then fell into unconsciousness. He was taken, by ambulance, to Harlem Hospital where he was pronounced dead. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.|$|R
40|$|The Klippel-Trenaunay {{syndrome}} (KTS) is a congenital disorder {{characterized by}} capillary malformation, varicosities and bony and soft tissue hypertrophy. This disease has several morbidities like bleeding, deep venous thrombosis, embolic complications {{and in some}} cases enlargement of limb that may require amputation. Vascular malformations are segmented and never cross midline.

60|$|Oh! if he only could, how gladly {{would he}} have seized her even now and carried her away from this nauseating scene of bloodshed and cruelty.

60|$|The two {{officers}} bowed and retired, and shortly afterwards the attendant drew back the curtain again, and a native, in the rags of a mendicant, entered, and bowed till his forehead touched the carpet.
