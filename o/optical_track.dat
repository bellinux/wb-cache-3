The <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> was a {{composite}} mix {{of the program and}} the control tones and were compatible with any optical playback system. All mono mixes of the Earthquake soundtrack contain the control tones. To control the Sensurround System and its volume levels, control tones recorded on the <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> varied from −28 dB to −20 dB below 100% modulation. Activation of the Sensurround System occurred at −30 dB. For program sounds applied to the Sensurround Horns, the composite mono soundtrack was used, with its volume and timing regulated by the 25 Hz control tone.|$|E
50|$|Sensor fusion {{combines}} {{data from}} several tracking algorithms and can yield better outputs than only one technology. One of the variants of sensor fusion is to merge inertial and <b>optical</b> <b>tracking.</b> Such technology was implemented in ALT: Antilatency tracker.While <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> {{would be the}} main tracking method, but when occlusion occurs, inertial tracking would estimate the position till the objects would visible to the optical camera again. Inertial tracking could also generate position data in-between <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> position data because inertial tracking has higher update rate. <b>Optical</b> <b>tracking</b> helps to cope with drift of inertial tracking.|$|R

40|$|Background Navigation with <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> {{sometimes}} {{makes it}} difficult to establish a line-of-sight in cluttered operating theatres. On the other hand, the accuracy of electromagnetic tracking is influenced by ferromagnetic surgical equipment. We compared electromagnetic with <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> under controlled conditions for the lateral skull base. Methods Six anatomical specimens were dissected to measure the target reg-istration error (TRE) in and around the petrous bone in a wet laboratory to simulate an intraoperative setting. Specimens were registered with passive op-tical and electromagnetic tracking. Results Overall accuracy was better using <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> than electromag-netic tracking (0. 22 mm; 0. 07 – 0. 48 vs 0. 99 mm; 0. 56 – 1. 27 mm; median, lower and upper quartiles, respectively; p< 0. 001). Conclusion The accuracy of <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> was near the resolution of the camera system, whereas the accuracy of electromagnetic tracking was lower. Only <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> allows for an application accuracy of considerably less than 1 mm in high-resolution datasets. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
5000|$|... 35mm 4-Track Magnetic with <b>Optical</b> <b>Track</b> (magoptical): This type of Sensurround print was not usable as a mono optical print. Unlike {{standard}} magoptical prints, {{in which}} the <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> was a mono version of the magnetic stereo tracks, the <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> on magnetic Sensurround prints contained only the control tones. If played as a standard optical print, only the 25 Hz and 35 Hz control tones would be heard. To control the Sensurround System and its volume levels, control tones recorded on the <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> varied from −14 to −6 dB below 100% modulation and activation of the Sensurround System occurred at −16 dB. For program sounds applied to the Sensurround Horns, Track-2 (Center Front) was used, with its level and timing controlled by the 25 Hz control tone. For magnetic playback in mono, Track-2 (Center Front) could be used because Earthquake was mixed with mono dialogue, unlike most stereo films up to that time. For 4-Track equipped theaters that wanted to run Earthquake without Sensurround, the standard 12 kHz CinemaScope switching signal was recorded on Track-4 (surround). Because no noise reduction system was used on magnetic prints at the time, and due to the lower technical performance of the surround channels magnetic track, this switching system was implemented by 20th Century Fox during CinemaScope's development to reduce the hiss and system noise heard from the surround speakers. For Earthquake run in the United States, the surround speakers were disconnected and the Sensurround system was relied upon to produce all the surround sound effects; Track-4 was not used nor even connected to the Sensurround Integrator. In Europe, the surround track {{was used in the}} normal manner, being controlled by the Sensurround Integrator like the other magnetic channels.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a robust}} {{adaptive}} control scheme is proposed for <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> telescopes with parametric uncertainty, unknown external disturbance and input saturation. To improve tracking performance of this robust adaptive control scheme, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is employed {{to tackle the}} integrated effect amalgamated from unknown parameters, unknown external disturbance and input saturation. At the same time, the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is introduced to approximate the input of an unknown function. Utilizing the estimated outputs of NDO and RBFNN, the robust adaptive control scheme is developed for <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> telescopes. Stability of the closed-loop system is rigourously proved via Lyapunov analysis and the convergent tracking error is guaranteed for <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> telescopes.

50|$|For Optical recording, {{the film}} {{only had a}} single {{perforation}} and {{the area where the}} other set of perforations would have been was exposed to a small bright lamp inside the camera controlled by an amplifier (usually in a separate box) that would vary the area of recording (RCA type), by means of shutters pulled back by variation in current, or variations in intensity (Western Electric type). Editing involved painting or taping over the <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> for the distance the sound led the film through the camera and projector. This would avoid the popping sound, but would result in a second of silence.|$|E
50|$|The {{analogue}} <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> {{technology has}} also changed: {{in the early}} years of the 21st century distributors changed to using cyan dye optical soundtracks instead of applicated tracks, which use environmentally unfriendly chemicals to retain a silver (black-and-white) soundtrack. Because traditional incandescent exciter lamps produce copious amounts of infra-red light, and cyan tracks do not absorb infra-red light, this change has required theaters to replace the incandescent exciter lamp with a complementary colored red LED or laser. These LED or laser exciters are backwards-compatible with older tracks. The film Anything Else (2003) was the first to be released with only cyan tracks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{control track}} {{consisted}} of a clear line on a dark background in the spaces between the sprocket holes on the soundtrack side of the film (i.e. in the spaces now used for the data packets on Dolby SR-D prints). It was scanned by an additional <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> reader that scanned a portion of film 0.09" [...] (2.3mm) wide {{along the line of}} the sprocket holes. The alternating sprocket holes and dark film produced a 96 Hz signal from the track reader, the amplitude of which depended on the average density of the film between the sprocket holes and thus on the control track width.|$|E

50|$|Today, {{virtually}} all films are released in stereophonic sound as the Westrex Stereo Variable-Area system developed in 1977 for Star Wars {{is no more}} expensive to manufacture than mono. The format employs the same Western Electric/Westrex/Nuoptix RA-1231 recorder, and coupled with QS quadraphonic matrixing technology licensed to Dolby Labs from Sansui, this SVA system can produce the same Left, Center, Right and Surround sound of the original CinemaScope system of 1953 by using a single standard-width <b>optical</b> <b>track.</b> This important development finally brought stereo sound to so-called Flat (Non-Wide-Screen) films presented at the most common aspect ratio of 1.85:1 although a number of `flat' films are photographed and presented {{at a ratio of}} 1.66:1, common in Europe or 1.75:1 common in museums.|$|E
50|$|The {{need for}} a center speaker to locate screen-centered sounds has been {{recognised}} since the Bell labs experiments in stereo sound from the 1930s, and multi-channel cinema sound systems, starting with the first commercial stereophonic film (Fantasia-1941) have always included one. Post-war stereo sound in theaters initially came from separate magnetic film reproducers synchronised to the picture, but in the 1950s systems using magnetic stripes on the film itself came into use. Cinemascope used four such tracks (left, center, right and surround), and the subsequent Todd-AO 70mm system used six (left, left-center, center, right-center and right, plus a single surround channel). Unfortunately these magnetic systems were not only very expensive, but were also unreliable and so were little used, the industry preferring {{to stay with the}} tried, tested (and cheap) mono <b>optical</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>tracking</b> {{has been}} an {{important}} subject of research since several decades. The utilization of <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> systems {{can be found in a}} wide range of areas, including military, medicine, industry, entertainment, etc. In this thesis a complete hardware platform that targets high-speed <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> applications is presented. The implemented hardware system contains three main components: a high-speed camera which is equipped with a 1. 3 M pixel image sensor capable of operating at 500 frames per second, a CameraLink grabber which is able to interface three cameras, and an FPGA+Dual-DSP based image processing platform. The hardware system is designed using a modular approach. The ﬂexible architecture enables to construct a scalable <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> system, which allows a large number of cameras to be used in the tracking environment. One of the greatest challenges in a multi-camera based <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> system is the huge amounts of image data that must be processed in real-time. In this thesis, the study on FPGA based high-speed image processing is performed. The FPGA implementation for a number of image processing operators is described. How to exploit diﬀerent levels of parallelisms in the algorithm to achieve high processing throughput is explained in detail. This thesis also presents a new single-pass blob analysis algorithm. With an optimized FPGA implementation, the geometrical features of a large number of blobs can be calculated in real-time. At the end of this thesis, a prototype design which integrates all the implemented hardware and software modules is demonstrated to prove the usability of the proposed <b>optical</b> <b>tracking</b> system...|$|R

50|$|The Movietone {{sound system}} is an optical sound-on-film method of {{recording}} sound for motion pictures that guarantees synchronization between sound and picture. It achieves this by recording the sound as a variable-density <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> {{on the same}} strip of film that records the pictures. The initial version was capable of a frequency response of 8500 Hz. Although sound films today use variable-area tracks, any modern motion picture theater (excluding those that have transitioned to digital cinema) can play a Movietone film without modification to the projector (though if the projector's sound unit has been fitted with red LED or laser light sources, the reproduction quality from a variable density track will be significantly impaired). Movietone {{was one of four}} motion picture sound systems under development in the U.S. during the 1920s, the others being DeForest Phonofilm, Warner Brothers' Vitaphone, and RCA Photophone, though Phonofilm was primarily an early version of Movietone.|$|E

Pre-war {{the most popular}} film was Ortho reversal costing only about 4/6 per charger. After the war Panchromatic film became more usual, and around 1953 even Kodachrome I became available, though it took weeks to get it processed in Paris. Pathescope Colour Film (actually made by Ferrania) {{was introduced in the}} 1950s. A number of cameras and projectors were produced, the more successful including the Pathescope H camera and Gem projector. Optical sound was introduced for 9.5 mm in 1938, but efforts to produce a library of sound films were interrupted by the War. The <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> resulted in a rather square frame format for the picture.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the {{original}} version of Sensurround, Mod-II (and later, Mod-III) were only for use with mono optical soundtracks. Due {{to the use of}} dbx Type-II noise reduction, MCA eliminated the standard Academy Filter traditionally used on optical prints, thus giving Sensurround an increased frequency response of 16 Hz to 16 kHz and a dynamic range of 86 dB, superior to 70mm magnetic prints of the time. It also allowed a mono <b>optical</b> <b>track</b> to have surround sound effects and MCA began to market the system to other studios and producers as a truly high-fidelity sound and special effects system. Dolby Stereo optical was just beginning to become known in the industry and MCA felt they had a viable competing format. While Warner Bros. and Paramount seriously considered adopting the system, in the end only Universal Studios ever released films using the process.
