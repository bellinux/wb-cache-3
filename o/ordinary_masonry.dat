If we place the Mycenaean [...] "bloom-time" [...] from [...] "the seventeenth or sixteenth to the twelfth century B.C.," [...] [Footnote: Tsountas and Manatt, p. 322.] it is plain that there is space to spare, between the poet's age {{and that of his}} heroes, for the rise of changes in war, weapons, and costume. Indeed, there are traces enough of change even in the objects and art discovered in the bloom-time, as represented by the Mycenaean acropolis itself and by other [...] "Mycenaean" [...] sites. The art of the fragment of a silver vase in a grave, on which a siege is represented, is not the art, the costumes are not the costumes, of the inlaid bronze dagger-blade. The men shown on the vase and the lion-hunters on the dagger both have their hair close cropped, but on the vase they are naked, on the dagger they wear short drawers. On the Vaphio cups, found in a tholos chamber-tomb near Amyclae, the men are [...] "long-haired Achaeans," [...] with heavy, pendent locks, like the man on a pyxis from Knossos, published by Mr. Evans; they are of another period than the close-cropped men of the vase and dagger. [Footnote: Journal of Hellenic Studies, vol. xvi. p. 102.] Two of the men on the silver vase are covered either with shields of a shape and size elsewhere unknown in Mycenaean art, or with cloaks of an unexampled form. The masonry of the city wall, shown on the vase in the Mycenaean grave, is not the <b>ordinary</b> <b>masonry</b> of Mycenae itself. On the vase the wall is [...] "isodomic," [...] built of cut stones in regular layers. Most of the Mycenaean walls, on the other hand, are of [...] "Cyclopean" [...] style, in large irregular blocks.|$|E

The pointed masonry arches, discretized in rigid voussoirs, are studied with the assumption of: - inability to carry tension for the contact interfaces - limited compressive strength at interfaces obtained considering the closed parabolic N-M yield domain opportunely replaced by a piecewise linear yield domain having six or eight sides - provision for blocks to slide with dilatancy. As far as it concerns the modeling -with regard to <b>ordinary</b> <b>masonries</b> made of stones, or of bricks having small dimensions compared with the dimensions of the structure-, we have verified that good results can be obtained already with a discretization of the masonry arches by a limited number rigid blocks.

40|$|The seismic {{vulnerability}} assessment of old masonry buildings is essential {{not only to}} buildings with recognised historical and heritage value but also to <b>ordinary</b> residential <b>masonry</b> buildings. This paper approaches the seismic {{vulnerability assessment}} of masonry buildings by applying a simplified methodology to the old city centre of Seixal in Portugal. The methodology adopted {{in this study was}} based on a vulnerability index used for the evaluation of damage and the study of loss scenarios on a large scale. Over 500 buildings were assessed using this methodology, and the results were analysed using an integrated Geographical Information System tool. The integration of the vulnerability and loss results could allow city councils or regional authorities to plan interventions based on a global view of the site under analysis, leading to more accurate and comprehensive risk mitigation strategies that support the requirements of safety and emergency planning...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{technical}} strategies for seismic upgrading of <b>ordinary</b> <b>masonry</b> buildings, often utilized after earthquakes, consist in strengthening walls by means of thin reinforced mortar slabs applied at one or {{both sides of the}} wall and linked to it. This type of technical provision has been currently employed in Italy and widely utilized after the 1976 Friuli earthquake. In spite of this, no experimental investigation has been performed until now to asses structural behaviour of the composite structure masonry wall-reinforced mortar slabs. In this work an experimental investigation has been carried out on masonry wall panels strengthened with different technical and executive strategies commonly used for <b>ordinary</b> <b>masonry</b> of private building. To evaluate shear strength of strengthened masonry walls, four wall test units (panels) with dimensions of 100 x 100 x 25 cm and subjected to in-plane loads have been experimented. One of the wall panel was made of <b>ordinary</b> <b>masonry,</b> one was strengthened by a reinforced mortar slab applied only on one side, one had reinforced mortar slabs on both sides but anti-adherent sheaths between the masonry panel and the slabs to simulate the case of bad realization of the upgrading, and one had slabs on both sides and perfectly adherent to it. The study shows the importance of realizing a good adhesion between the masonry wall and the reinforced mortar slabs. Indeed increase of 26 % in strength of about has been observed in the composite wall panel with perfectly adherent slabs in comparison to the composite wall panel with anti-adherent sheaths between the wall and the slabs...|$|E

This unit is characterized as deep basement, thick sediment, unconsolidated material and having abundant shallow groundwater. The area has high possibility of ground amplification occurrence (Daryono, 2011) (Nurwihastuti et al., 2014) (Koseki, et al., 2007) (Pandita et al. 2016). Parallel with the result of Nurwihastuti, et al.

The probabilistic model also shows that the usage of <b>ordinary</b> reinforced <b>masonry</b> and clay tile is not suitable in this area. it estimates that the combination of structure and roof material types in this zone gives a probability of collpase between 0.51 and 0.84.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the inelastic behavior of a newly-developed type of self-insulating concrete masonry shear wall (SCMSW) under in-plane cyclic loading. The new masonry system was made from concrete blocks with special configurations to provide a stronger bond between units than <b>ordinary</b> concrete <b>masonry</b> units. A total of six fully-grouted SCMSWs were prepared with different heights (1. 59 to 5. 78 m) and different vertical steel configurations. The developed masonry walls were tested under in-plane cyclic loading and different constant axial load ratios. In addition, {{the relationship between the}} amount of axial loading, the amount of the flexural reinforcement and the wall aspect ratios and the nonlinear hysteretic response of the SCMSW was evaluated. The results showed that the lateral load capacity of SCMSW increases with the amount of applied axial load and the amount of vertical reinforcement. However, the lateral load capacity decreases as the wall aspect ratio increases. The existence of the boundary elements at the SCMSW ends increases the ductility and the lateral load capacity. Generally, the SCMSW exhibited predominantly flexural behavior. These results agreed with those reported in previous research for walls constructed with ordinary units...|$|R

A periodic heat transfer analysis for PCCM slab has been developed (assuming effective thermal properties of PCCM) to assess the load levelling of the periodic heat flux and thermal storage characteristics of a PCCM wall/roof. It is found that a PCCM wall of thickness which is even less than that of an <b>ordinary</b> <b>masonry</b> concrete wall is more desirable for providing efficient thermal energy storage and maximum load levelling and hence is suitable for providing excellent thermal comfort in an air-conditioned building.

Hundreds of low-intensity events occurred between January and March, 2009. The mainshock took place on April 6, 2009, and its epicenter was located at about 6 km southwest of L'Aquila town; three stronger aftershocks happened on April 7 and 9, 2009. This paper focuses on actual performance of older and more recently constructed building structures during the earthquake sequence. After the main seismological characteristics of the sequence are described, the most significant observed damages are analyzed and associated with theoretical failure modes for both reinforced concrete and unreinforced masonry buildings. Since older masonry structures were more seriously damaged, {{the effects of the}} earthquake are described with more emphasis to <b>ordinary</b> <b>masonry</b> and cultural heritage buildings (churches, palaces, and castles). In conclusion, a number of lessons may be learned from the L'Aquila earthquake sequence.

40|$|For many {{countries}} in seismic areas, {{the maintenance of the}} architectural heritage is nowadaysan essential priority. In Italy for example, the 90 % of the built up areas are more than 30 years old and the problem of the safety assessment and rehabilitation of the existing buildings is somehow crucial, due to the coming into force of a new generation seismic code adopting safety standards that are definitely higher than the previous. In this framework, the authors present a first analysis of the seismic reliability of a number oflow-rise <b>ordinary</b> <b>masonry</b> buildings, sorted with different geometrical and mechanical properties anddifferent ages. The analysis is then repeated by considering the main shear walls of the buildings strengthenedwith fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) reinforcements. Typically, masonry shear wall systems behavelike a low-ductility parallel systems, which exhibit a somewhat redundancy. When structural reinforcements with brittle behavior like FRP are introduced, the system ductility decreases together with the residual redundancy, and the reliability outcome does not increase as expected. The obtained results allow very interesting considerations on the reliability of the existing masonry structures andthe effectiveness of this strengthening technique when applied to masonry shear wall systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Low-rise {{unreinforced}} block masonry {{structures are}} investigated for resistance against site amplified ground motions, {{before and after}} retrofitting with reinforced plaster. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of indigenous and cost-effective retrofitting technique for improving the seismic performance of <b>ordinary</b> <b>masonry</b> structures. The retrofitting technique involved cement grouting of damaged walls and fixing steel wire mesh on wall surface, plastered with rich cement mortar. Experimental investigations carried out on block masonry material and prototype walls are analyzed to retrieve the mechanical characteristics for mathematical modeling of structures. Two case study low-rise (two storey) structures are assessed through nonlinear incremental dynamic time history analysis technique using natural accelerograms. The considered retrofitting technique increases the lateral load carrying capacity of in-plane walls by about 10 percent and ductility capacity by 100 percent and ensures flexure (toe crushing) response mechanism to lateral loading. The technique increased the seismic resistance of structures to ground shaking by 43 percent. It is observed that the retrofitted structures can survive ground shaking intensity up to 0. 40 g/ 0. 50 g whereas shaking intensity of 0. 73 g/ 0. 90 g (and above) may cause the structure collapse (with 95 percent confidence), indicating that the technique can be confidently used fo...|$|E
40|$|In {{the seismic}} design and {{assessment}} of <b>ordinary</b> <b>masonry</b> buildings the prediction {{of the strength of}} masonry piers subject to in-plane lateral forces plays a crucial role. Different simplified models are present in literature and codes to describe the failure modes of piers (Rocking/Crushing, Bed Joint Sliding, Diagonal Cracking) and to predict their load bearing capacity. In general, they are based on simple idealizations of the limit strength domain of masonry through few mechanical parameters. Referring in particular to the Diagonal Cracking failure mode, two models are usually adopted: that of Turnšek and Čačovič (1970) and that of Mann and Müller (1980). These models are dependent on two main mechanical parameters: the cohesion of mortar joints, usually obtained through the triplet test, and the tensile strength of masonry, usually derived by the diagonal compression test. Aim {{of this paper is to}} synthetically analyse the physical meaning, the experimental evaluation and the proper use of these parameters. Moreover, a method to relate the result of the diagonal compression test to a “mean” value of the cohesion is proposed. This latter test offers two main advantages: a versatile application to different types of masonry (also irregular ones); the capability of providing “mean” mechanical parameters, representative of the whole masonry...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} the seismic {{reliability}} assessment of <b>ordinary</b> <b>masonry</b> wall systems strengthened with fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) is considered. Recently, the use of these high strength composite materials, like Carbon or Glass fiber composites, has considerably increased in the field of structural repair of both recent and historical masonry buildings. The applications in the field of architectural heritage are mainly intended to prevent the loss of the construction (with its frescoes, ornaments, sculptures), as a result of exceptional actions like earthquake. In case of such events, the net of reinforcing elements must allow the structure to do not collapse. However, the application of FRP external reinforcements with elastic-brittle behavior on low ductility structural elements like masonry walls induces a further reduction of the componential ductility, moving the system toward an ideal elastic-brittle behavior. This involves a careful examination of the brittle components “bundle effect” in order to evaluate the restoration effect on the reliability of the structural system. In fact, the simple evaluation of the safety margin of each structural element does not lead directly to a reliability judgment on the structure as a whole. As is well known, in case of brittle elements, the collapse load of the system can be significantly lower than the sum of the single structural element collapse load...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{proposes a}} method for the {{vulnerability}} assessment of <b>ordinary</b> <b>masonry</b> buildings at territorial scale, {{to be used in}} the framework of a probabilistic seismic risk analysis. The classification of the built environment is based on the SYNER-G taxonomy and is dependent on the available data in the study area; it consists in the aggregation of buildings characterized by a homogeneous seismic behavior, which is known from empirical damage on similar structures, proper analytical models or expert judgment. The general definition of fragility functions is recalled, through the use of static non linear analysis for the evaluation of the capacity spectrum and the calculation of the maximum displacement by the demand spectrum. The selection of proper intensity measures for masonry buildings is treated, as well as the definition of damage and performance limit states. A detailed procedure for the propagation of uncertainties is proposed, which is able to single out each independent contribution. Then, some recommendations for deriving fragility functions with different approaches are given. In particular, it is shown how the macroseismic vulnerability method, derived from EMS 98, can be used by expert elicitation or if empirical data are available. Moreover, the DBV-masonry (Displacement Based Vulnerability) method is proposed as a powerful tool for the derivation of fragility function by an analytical approach. Finally, fragility functions are derived for ten different classes of masonry buildings, defined by a list of tags from the taxonomy, in order to show the capabilities of the proposed methods and their cross-validation...|$|E

The traditional building techniques of the Madonie which involve several typologies of building materials (used for <b>ordinary</b> <b>masonry,</b> decorative elements, in the manufacture of artificial aggregates) were also influenced by the geological characteristics of the territory.

These were made using gypsum as raw material extracted in the same area and fired in special furnaces that today are testified only by few ruins. The examined samples are representative of gypsum mortars used on local stone-built structure. The study, enriched by documentary/ethnographic research on traditional kilns, locally called "carcare", was conducted by means of mineralogical and petrographic methods (XRD, optical microscopy and SEM-EDS) with the aim to characterize historic mortars in terms of composition and texture and recover the ancient recipes and also localize the source area of raw materials.

The ultimate strength and displacement of wall systems is evaluated by means of a displacement driven non linear analysis (pushover analysis). Then, the structural strengthening with elastic brittle behavior like FRP strips is considered, and the increased shear strength of each masonry wall is provided, computing finally the building force-displacement relationship up to failure. The statistical analysis of the population’s performance points out with strong evidence the conflicting effect of strength and brittleness of FRP materials in enhancing the seismic reliability of complex low strength stone and masonry structures. As this preliminary study shows, the effective safety increment of the repaired system is seriously limited by its reduced ductility. The presented results seem to predict that very small reliability increments can be produced even applying huge FRP reinforcement ratios, so that for a class of buildings characterized by very low ductility, the strengthening with FRP is simply unfeasible...|$|E
