25|$|BAE Systems' {{original}} working baseline for the Global Combat Ship {{design was}} a vessel 141 metres long with a displacement of 6,850 tonnes {{and a range}} of 7,000 nautical miles at 18 knots. However, on 30 November 2010 it was reported that the specifications had been pared down, in effort to reduce the cost from £500M to £250-350M per ship. Subsequently, new specification details began to emerge of a smaller 5,400 tonne ship emphasising flexibility and modularity. Unlike the FSC, the Global Combat Ship has only <b>one</b> <b>hull</b> design. However like the Franco-Italian family of FREMM multipurpose frigates, three versions are proposed for export: a design optimised for anti-submarine warfare (ASW), an anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) variant, and a general purpose (GP) variant.|$|E
500|$|On Montanans next trip, {{the ship}} {{collided}} with a wharf in Los Angeles Harbor. Montanan had arrived in Los Angeles from Puget Sound on 22 January 1915 to complete her load before sailing for New York and Boston. The almost fully loaded ship was slow {{to respond to the}} helm and ended up [...] "ploughing through" [...] of Municipal Pier A on Mormon Island channel before coming to a stop at a stone bulkhead. <b>One</b> <b>hull</b> plate on Montanan was dented, but the ship was otherwise undamaged. Montanans captain, who had a local license, did not take on a harbor pilot and American-Hawaiian was liable for the damage, estimated by the harbor engineer to be $2,500.|$|E
2500|$|A proa, {{also seen}} as prau, perahu, and prahu, {{is a type}} of multihull sailboat. It is a vessel {{consisting}} of two (usually) unequal length parallel hulls. [...] It is sailed so that <b>one</b> <b>hull</b> is kept to windward, and the other to leeward, so that it needs to [...] "shunt" [...] to reverse direction when tacking. The English term proa usually refers specifically to the South Pacific proa as described in the journals of the British ship HMS Centurion.|$|E
50|$|A quadrimaran is a four hulled watercraft. Its {{defining}} {{factor is}} four hulls, placing {{it within the}} multihull category. It has <b>one</b> more <b>hull</b> than a trimaran, and <b>one</b> less <b>hull</b> than a pentamaran. Conventional western vessels, by contrast, are monohulls.|$|R
25|$|The Mackenzie {{class were}} {{equipped}} with one SPS-12 air search radar, one SPS-10B surface search radar and one Sperry Mk.2 navigation radar. For detection below the surface, the ships had one SQS-501 high frequency bottom profiler sonar, <b>one</b> SQS-503 <b>hull</b> mounted active search sonar, one SQS-502 high frequency mortar control sonar and <b>one</b> SQS-11 <b>hull</b> mounted active search sonar.|$|R

2500|$|Mine {{countermeasure}} {{vessels in}} service with the Royal Navy include: seven Sandown-class minehunters and eight Hunt-class mine countermeasure vessels. The Hunt-class combine the separate {{roles of the}} traditional minesweeper and the active minehunter in <b>one</b> <b>hull.</b> If required, the Sandown and Hunt-class vessels can take {{on the role of}} offshore patrol vessels. [...] is an ocean survey vessel and at 13,500 tonnes {{is one of the largest}} ships in the Navy. The other survey vessels of the Royal Navy are the two multi-role ships of the Echo-class, which came into service in 2002 and 2003, and , which at just over 20 tonnes is the smallest commissioned vessel in the Navy.|$|E
60|$|One {{thing that}} had {{inclined}} Ja particularly to the felucca {{was the fact that}} it included oars in its equip-ment. He realized the limitations of his people in the matter of sails, and while they had never used oars, the implement was so similar to a paddle that he was sure they quickly could master the art--and they did. As soon as <b>one</b> <b>hull</b> was completed Ja kept it on the water constantly, first with one crew and then with another, until two thousand red warriors had learned to row. Then they stepped their masts and a crew was told off for the first ship.|$|E
50|$|Proas have <b>one</b> <b>hull</b> and one outrigger. Engines are {{commonly}} {{placed on the}} main hull.|$|E

50|$|As {{catamarans}} {{have more}} than <b>one</b> <b>hull,</b> there is a different beam calculation {{for this kind of}} vessel.|$|E
50|$|A monohull {{is a type}} of boat {{having only}} <b>one</b> <b>hull,</b> unlike multihulled boats which can have two or more {{individual}} hulls connected to one another.|$|E
50|$|A {{ship with}} <b>one</b> <b>hull</b> of {{conventional}} shape {{and two small}} side hulls (outriggers) is called an outrigger ship. This type is identified as trimaran in English language publications.|$|E
50|$|<b>One</b> {{prototype}} <b>hull</b> {{was completed}} and captured by US forces. It {{was taken to}} Aberdeen Proving Ground, and then later moved to the Patton museum.|$|R

5000|$|A multihull is a ship, vessel, craft or {{boat with}} more than <b>one</b> <b>hull.</b> Multihull ships (vessels, craft, boats) include {{multiple}} types, sizes and applications. Hulls range from two to five, of uniform or diverse types and arrangements ...|$|E
50|$|A mine {{countermeasures}} vessel or MCMV {{is a type}} of naval ship designed for the location of and destruction of naval mines which combines the role of a minesweeper and minehunter in <b>one</b> <b>hull.</b> The term MCMV is also applied collectively to minehunters and minesweepers.|$|E
5000|$|The CVA-01 {{aircraft}} carrier project was cancelled in the 1966 Defence White Paper, eliminating {{the requirement for}} the Type 82 class. Nevertheless, <b>one</b> <b>hull</b> of the original four was ordered on 4 October 1966 {{for use as a}} testbed for new technologies. HMS Bristol was laid down in 1967, featuring four new systems: ...|$|E

The hyperbolic convex <b>hull,</b> <b>one</b> of <b>hulls,</b> {{can be used to}} recognize the existing region of straight lines on the raster display. The geometric interpretation in the procedure of its answer-seeking is provided and on-line can be obtained by its algorithm.

5000|$|Ten Sa'ar IV class {{boats were}} {{built for the}} Israeli Navy. [...] only two remain in service.

Two vessels were sold to Sri Lanka.|$|E
50|$|The Hunt {{class is}} {{a class of}} {{thirteen}} mine countermeasure vessels of the Royal Navy. As built, they combined the separate roles of the traditional minesweeper {{and that of the}} active minehunter in <b>one</b> <b>hull,</b> but later modifications saw the removal of mine-sweeping equipment. They have a secondary role as offshore patrol vessels.|$|E
50|$|The USS Camden (AOE-2) is {{the second}} ship of the United States Navy named after the city of Camden, New Jersey that lies on the Delaware River across from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was a Sacramento-class fast combat support ship, {{combining}} the functions of three logistic support ships in <b>one</b> <b>hull</b> - fleet oiler (AO), ammunition ship (AE), and refrigerated stores ship (AF).|$|E

50|$|All trains on the Hull to Bridlington and Scarborough Line call here, {{giving the}} station a basic half-hourly service in each {{direction}} with several additional peak hour trains to and from Beverley. There is an hourly service each way on Sundays throughout the year since the December 2009 timetable change (see GB National Rail Timetable 43), with six trains {{in each direction}} through to/from Scarborough. From 21 May 2017 it will be served by <b>one</b> <b>Hull</b> Trains service to London King's Cross {{in the morning and}} Beverley in the evening.|$|E
50|$|The Tornado {{typically}} flies {{one of its}} two hulls; {{the crew}} balancing the boat with their own weight and by controlling the sails. With only <b>one</b> <b>hull</b> in the water, drag is significantly reduced. The Tornado also features an adjustable, rotating mast, which not only greatly improves the aerodynamics of the crucial {{leading edge of the}} sail, but also allows improved control over mast bend and thus mainsail flatness. For the high speeds and apparent wind directions seen by this high speed vessel, a flat sail profile is often required.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{it being}} on three lines, only ten trains a day (Monday to Saturday) call at Ulleskelf. Five to York {{northbound}} and two to Sheffield, <b>one</b> to <b>Hull</b> and two to Leeds (the {{first of which}} continues through to Blackpool North) southbound.|$|R
