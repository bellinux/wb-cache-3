The designed diesel engine thermal <b>overload</b> <b>monitoring</b> system consists of two set of sensors, i. e., a lambda sensor to measure the oxygen concentration and a fast response thermocouple to measure the temperature of the gas leaving the cylinder. A medium speed Ruston diesel engine is instrumented to measure the required engine process parameters, measurements are taken at constant load and variable fuel delivery i. e., normal and excessive injection. It is indicated that with excessive injection, the test engine is of high risk to be operated at thermal overload condition. Further tests were carried out on a Sulzer 7 RTA 84 T engine to explore the influence of engine operating at thermal overload condition on exhaust gas temperature and oxygen concentration in the blow down gas. It is established that a lower oxygen concentration in the blow down gas corresponds to a higher exhaust gas temperature. The piston crown wear rate will then be much higher due to the high rate of heat transfer from a voluminous flame...|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{monitoring}} is {{a research}} field whose results can be exploited for several purposes, such as network resource management, security and accounting. An effective monitor needs {{to be capable of}} analyzing the traffic flowing through the monitored network by losing as few packets as possible since packet loss may result in a non accurate measurement of the required metrics. Such a monitor captures the packets from the network, associates each packet to a flow by evaluating its characteristics, performs some flow measurements, and exports the results of data analysis. In high speed networks such tasks might be hard to accomplish in an efficient way, as the number of analyzed flows is very high. For this reason, we decided to design and implement a distributed monitoring system comprising several components each responsible for a different task. Such a distributed approach helps overcome the problem of an <b>overloaded</b> <b>monitoring</b> system. Furthermore, distributed systems need an appropriate protocol, that defines the kind as well as the sequence of messages exchanged between system components. In this paper we present both the monitoring architecture and the corresponding management protocol. Finally, in order for the monitoring system to support different kinds of applications, we developed an open framework allowing a user to define a customized set of metrics...|$|R
40|$|Ankrd 2 {{may be a}} {{link between}} the {{sarcomere}} and the nucleus; a similar role has recently been proposed for CARP that has a high level of structural and functional conservation with Ankrd 2. Both Ankrd 2 and CARP are involved in striated muscle hypertrophy. The mechanism by which muscle stretch is sensed and signals are transduced is still unknown; however, Ankrd 2 and CARP could play similar roles in pathways leading to hypertrophy, the triggering mechanisms being heart pressure <b>overload</b> <b>monitored</b> by CARP and mechanical stretch in skeletal muscle monitored by Ankrd 2. Recently Ankrd 2 and CARP have been proposed as members of a family of muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (MARPs) that form a complex with titin, myopalladin and calpain protease p 94, involved in signaling and regulation of gene expression in response to muscle stress. Here, we show that Ankrd 2 is able to interact with the Z-disc protein telethonin as well as being able to interact with three transcription factors: YB- 1, PML and p 53. Ankrd 2 binding to the ubiquitous transcription factor YB- 1 can be demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo; this is not very surprising, since a similar interaction was previously described for CARP. However, the interactions with PML and p 53 are unexpected new findings, with interesting implications in the Ankrd 2 signaling cascade. Ankrd 2 co-localizes with the transcriptional co-activator and co-repressor PML in nuclear bodies (NBs) in human myoblasts as detected by confocal immunofluorescence. Interestingly, we show that Ankrd 2 not only binds the tumor suppressor protein p 53 both in vitro and in vivo but also enhances the up-regulation of the p 21 WAFI/CIPI promoter by p 53. Therefore, our findings strengthen the hypothesis that Ankrd 2 may be involved in sensing stress signals and linking these to muscle gene regulation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Iron {{overload}} from genetic disorders and/or regular {{blood transfusions}} {{is a serious}} health problem in many regions of the world. As liver and spleen iron stores {{account for more than}} 70 % of total body iron stores, the precise quantification and the continuous monitoring of these stores is of particular importance in the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. During the last two decades several noninvasive methods have been explored for the assessment of elevated liver iron stores in patients with primary (genetic hemochromatosis) or with iron loading anemias (e. g., -thalassemia major, leukemia after bone marrow transplantation). Of these different methods only quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) [1] and SQUID biomagnetic liver susceptometry (BLS) [2] have achieved a broader clinical acceptance.

The system has been implemented in two applications. The first one is related to medicine and used for <b>overload</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{for the purpose of}} medical rehabilitation, and the second one is designated for railways, to locate points on cross-sections. Calibrated images are required as input data for the system. The calibration can be performed in a laboratory, using a test field, by means of cameras with constant interior orientation parameters. For medical purposes, several points are marked on the patient's body in selected locations. Convergent photographs composed of direct photos and images reflected from a mirror located behind the patient are used to record points at the patient's front and back. The mirror allows to reduce to the minimum the numbers of stands for image recording. In this case, free-focus cameras, such as Kodak DC 200, were used. The system of reference is defined by reference points located on the mirror surface. Results of measurements are shown in a graphic form. The second application concerns locating points on railways cross-sections. Digital cameras with nearly parallel axes are placed on a special railway platform. The co-ordinates of reference points marked on the stiff frame structure are determined in relation to the rail head level and track axis. These cameras have a high-precision shutter synchronisation. ...|$|E

When the variable step size SON algorithm is used, 10 % more sessions are served by LTE compared to the case of using fixed step size. This results in a severe overload of the LTE layer and causes the crossing point between variable and fixed step SON algorithms to occur at around 16 sessions/s load level. In case of the LTE LC based SON, the variable step size algorithm protects the LTE macro and micro layers and at highest load levels pushes too many sessions, around 60 % or more, to be served by WLAN and congesting the WLAN system at around 14 sessions/s.|$|R

40|$|Magister Commercii - MComThe {{increasing}} demand for client-centred {{services in a}} highly competitive business environment {{has resulted in a}} substantial {{increase in the number of}} call centres world wide (Knight 2004 cited in Carrim, Basson & Coetzee, 2006; Nel & De Villiers 2004 cited in Carrim et al., 2006; Williams, 2000 cited in Carrim et al., 2006). According to Holdsworth and Cartwright (2003); Malhotra and Mukherjee (2004); Singh and Goolsby (1994), the work of a customer service representative is seen as one of the ten most stressful jobs in the present-day world economy. Customer service representatives are highly susceptible to elevated levels of stress and burnout, more so than in any other work environment. Within the call centre environment specifically, turnover has been identified as one of the most pressing problems in terms of scope (levels or percentages of turnover), cost and productivity (O’Herron, 2003 cited in Spies, 2006). Factors that lead to unhappiness in call centres are, inter alia, the monotony and repetitiveness of the job content. This situation is aggravated by lack of opportunities for promotion and by stress (Worldroom Digest, 2004 cited in Carrim et al., 2006). In addition, Hochschild (1983) posits that organisations in the service industry do not hesitate to “commercialize” employees’ emotions as a means to attract and retain customers. Research suggests that service providers are under implicit and explicit pressure to regulate their emotions as a tool to lure customers into patronizing the organisation. In recent studies, several key factors were identified that are commonly associated with turnover intention among customer service representatives, namely, work <b>overload,</b> <b>monitoring</b> and surveillance of employees, competing management goals, upward career movement, lack of skill variety, and emotional labour (Cordes & Dougherty, 1993; Deery et al., 2002; Deery & Kinnie, 2004; Holman, 2004; Singh, 2000; Zapf, Isic, Bechtoldt & Blau, 2003). If not dealt with appropriately, stress, burnout and emotional labour can increase the turnover rate, which accordingly can be damaging to the organisation. The current research was conducted at an outbound call centre in a retail organisation in the Western Cape. The sample comprised of a hundred and sixty three call centre employees who are employed in the collections/outbound department. Convenience sampling was utilised. A self-developed Biographical Questionnaire, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (Maslach & Jackson, 1981), the Emotional Labour Scale (Brotheridge & Lee, 2003), the Experience of Work and Life Circumstances Questionnaire (Van Zyl &Van der walt, 1994), and the Turnover Intentions Questionnaire (Roodt, 2004) were used to collect the data. The data was analysed using SPSS and the results were interpreted by means of descriptive and inferential statistics (the Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient, T-Test, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Multiple Regression Analysis. The results indicate that there is a moderate relationship between stress and intention to leave the organisation amongst the sample of employees. There was also a significant relationship between burnout and intention to leave the organisation. Moreover, there was a significant relationship between emotional labour and intention to leave the organisation. Further findings of the current study are: there are significant differences in stress based on employees’ gender and tenure, a significant difference in burnout with regards to gender and employment type, and significant differences between emotional labour based on gender and tenure. However, no significant difference was found between burnout and tenure, nor was there a significant difference between emotional labour and employment type. Recommendations are made to alleviate the effects of stress on call centre employees which in turn, will minimise the effects of burnout and emotional labour. Recommendations included the development of wellness programmes, stress management programmes, coping programmes and effective communications as a mean to shape employee perceptions regarding their interpretation of organisational demands, threats or opportunities and to enhance call centre employees’ performance within their work.

Readjustment of the pulmonary artery band might be required in the postoperative period. In this study we aimed to test the feasibility of a novel device for bidirectionally adjustable pulmonary artery constriction. Methods: A hydraulic main pulmonary artery occluder was implanted in lambs and gradually inflated to create right ventricular pressure overload at a systemic (aortic) level. During the following period (up to 12 weeks), this pressure <b>overload</b> was <b>monitored</b> by measuring aortic and right ventricular pressures by means of implanted subcutaneous reservoirs. If required to maintain the right ventricular pressure overload at a systemic level in the growing animals, the occluder was deflated through a third subcutaneous reservoir. Results: After the banding period (average of 64 ± 8 days), the main pulmonary artery cuff could still be adjusted, and the animals showed no clinical signs of heart failure. Histologic analysis of the pulmonary artery showed extensive fibrosis, a giant cell response around the device, and small areas of tissue necrosis; complete transmural necrosis was not detected. Conclusions: This device allows adjustment of the pulmonary artery cuff in a precise manner over a prolonged period of time without surgical reintervention.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Noninvasive measurement of tissue iron levels {{can be assessed}} using T 2 * magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify and monitor patients with iron <b>overload.</b> This study <b>monitored</b> cardiac siderosis using T 2 * MRI in a cohort of 19 heavily iron-overloaded patients with β-thalassemia major receiving iron chelation therapy with deferasirox over an 18 -month period. Overall, deferasirox therapy significantly improved mean ± standard deviation cardiac T 2 * from a baseline of 17. 2 ± 10. 8 to 21. 5 ± 12. 8 ms (+ 25. 0 %; P= 0. 02). A concomitant reduction in median serum ferritin from a baseline of 5, 497 to 4, 235 ng/mL (− 23. 0 %; P= 0. 001), and mean liver iron concentration from 24. 2 ± 9. 0 to 17. 6 ± 12. 9 mg Fe/g dry weight (− 27. 1 %; P= 0. 01) was also seen. Improvements were seen in patients with various degrees of cardiac siderosis, including those patients with a baseline cardiac T 2 * of < 10 ms, indicative of high cardiac iron burden. These findings therefore support previous observations that deferasirox is effective in the removal of myocardial iron with concomitant reduction in total body iron...|$|R
40|$|The Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) {{systems are}} used, among other applications, in {{pavement}} and bridge engineering, in infrastructure {{monitoring and assessment}} and inspection and reinforcement strategies. In the Netherlands and some other countries, the video-WIM system was implemented for pre-selection, and for continuously <b>monitoring</b> <b>overloads.</b> The systems record pictures of vehicles analyzed in the system together with measurements for number of axles, inter axle separation, vehicle length, weight per axle vehicular speed and total vehicular weight. In one month the WIM system in the Netherlands stores approximately 150, 000 registrations of trucks. Currently, the WIM system operates in eight locations in the Netherlands. Because {{of the nature of}} the traffic, the quantities measured are regarded as random variables. The dependence structure of the data of such complex systems as the traffic systems are also very complex. Thus, the aim would be to be able to represent the complex multidimensional-distribution with a model where the dependence may be explained in a clear way and different locations where the system operates may be treated simultaneously. Bayesian Networks (BNs) offer an alternative for a model with the characteristics listed above. In this paper we discuss the construction of a large scale BN and results concerning its ability to adequately represent the data. The paper places special attention in the construction of the model. Furthermore, ideas as to how the model may be extended to include locations where the WIM system does not operate are given. These ideas benefit from structured expert judgment techniques previously used to quantify large scale Hybrid Bayesian networks (HBNs) with success. Copyright © (2012) by IAPSAM & ESRA...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground and aimElderly {{patients}} {{are vulnerable to}} complications of intravenous fluid <b>overload,</b> however daily <b>monitoring</b> of fluid balance in this population has been highlighted as sub optimal by the NCEPOD. We compare current practice in fluid balance monitoring and intravenous fluid prescribing for elderly patients in a London District General Hospital to guidelines for fluid management in children issued by the National Patient Safety Agency. MethodsThis study consists of two parts: (1) a ward-based survey of fluid balance monitoring in all patients above the age of 65 receiving intravenous fluids; (2) an anonymous questionnaire completed by 20 doctors {{of a variety of}} grades and specialities on the parameters of fluid balance routinely checked by doctors prior to prescribing intravenous fluids. ResultsThe results highlight that the most frequently monitored parameters of fluid balance are daily serum urea, creatinine and sodium levels (65. 1 % of patients receiving intravenous fluids on the wards, 85 % of doctors check these levels before prescribing fluids). Initial weight is measured in one quarter of patients; daily weight is monitored in 9. 4 % of patients and 25 % of doctors check daily weight before prescribing intravenous fluids. ConclusionInitial and daily weights are non-invasive parameters of fluid balance that are infrequently monitored in elderly patients receiving intravenous fluids. We propose that all elderly patients should be weighed (1) on admission to the Emergency Department, (2) prior to commencement of intravenous fluids and (3) on a regular basis, preferably daily, for the duration of intravenous fluid administration. For immobile patients, strict fluid input–output charts should be maintained as a surrogate index of changes in daily weight. We encourage consistent and accurate documentation of these non-invasive parameters on the fluid prescription charts...|$|R
40|$|Objective:  Although it {{has been}} known for about 200 years that the blood flow (i. e. the cardiac output), and not the blood pressure, is decisive for the oxygen supply of the cells and that the blood pressure, but not the cardiac output, is {{measured}} intraoperatively. The aim is to explain why and in which patients an cardiac output measurement is already useful in an intraoperative manner. Method: With the Vigileo / FloTrac® system, a pulse contour-based, self-calibrating method for the cardiac output measurement has recently been available. The advantage {{is the fact that the}} sensor can be connected to any arterial cannula, that is to say, intraoperatively in the case of an advanced hemodynamic monitoring which is not provided a priori if a patient unexpectedly deteriorates. Studies on hemodynamic optimization were performed with the aim of ensuring an optimal filling of the heart, ensuring adequate oxygen supply and / or achieving a sufficient mixed or central venous saturation (ScvO 2) and thus improving the "outcome" of the patients. Results:  Numerous studies have shown that an intraoperative measurement and optimization of the cardiac output or the oxygen transport capacity (DO 2) in patients with high risk can lead to lethality and morbidity (complication rate) lowering the length of stay (intensive care unit, hospital). Thus, in spite of the intraoperative <b>overload,</b> the advanced <b>monitoring</b> and optimization therapy (essentially fluids and catecholamines), the total cost of treatment can be reduced by up to 25 %. An early onset of the measures (e. g., intraoperatively) was decisive, whereas a later onset (for example, only after an organ failure had ceased) had no effect. Conclusion:  A hemodynamic monitoring and optimization of flow - based variables (cardiac output, DO 2, ScvO 2), which already begins intraoperatively, lowers mortality in surgical high-risk patients at the same time economic advantages. However, unrealistic target values ​​should be avoided in the optimization, in order not to endanger the patients...|$|R

In such a context, high level cognitive functions are vital abilities for handling the aircraft, interpreting the instrument parameters, maintaining up-to-date situation awareness and making relevant decisions. These functions, which are traditionally labelled executive functions or cognitive control, are known to involve the prefrontal cortex (Miller & Cohen, 2001), this latter being also involved in decision making in uncertain environment, including navigation task (Yoshida & Ishii, 2006). Despite its impressive complexity, human brain exhibits severe capacity constraints in information processing. Neural basis for such limitations has been showed in various neuroimaging studies (Charron & Koechlin, 2010; Dux, Ivanoff, Asplund, & Marois, 2006). When cognitive functions are overloaded, which is often the case when the context is unfamiliar, uncertain or when time pressure is high, the pilots performance are lessened Durantin et al. 2013). Worst, they may face cognitive tunneling, defined as the inability of the operator to reallocate his/her attention from one task to another (Thomas & Wickens, 2001). In such a situation, it is more likely to commit error and to miss critical information such as visual or auditory alerts. A promising way to detect mental <b>overload</b> is to <b>monitor</b> the prefrontal lobes online. Near infrared spectroscopy is an increasingly popular technique for observing the brain functioning (e. g., Ayaz, 2012). Contrary to more common neuroimaging technique like functional magnetic resonance imaging, it allows in vivo imaging in ecological condition with a correct freedom of movement and in complex environments such as high-fidelity simulators. We used a BIOPAC 16 channel functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to monitor prefrontal activity of 10 airline student pilots during two landing phases (easy and difficult) in a flight simulator. In both scenarios, instrument landing system was available to help performing the approach. However, in the easy landing scenario, the external visibility was perfect and there was no crosswind while in the difficult landing scenario, there was no external visibility (dense cloud layer) and there was a strong crosswind. So, the difficult landing condition was supposed to load more heavily on executive functions than the easy one. As expected, results from subjective measurements revealed that perceived cognitive mental effort was higher during the difficult landing. The right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was the region that demonstrated the highest concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin (HBo 2) during both scenarios. In addition, fNIRS measurements showed significantly higher right DLPFC concentrations of HBo 2 for the difficult landing than for the easy one. In the difficult scenario, the flight performance was strongly degraded in comparison to the easy one. This result demonstrates the sensitivity of fNIRS to detect mental overload in complex and ecological set up. The applications concern online monitoring of the pilot mental workload as well as the evaluation and the certification of new cockpit designs...|$|R
