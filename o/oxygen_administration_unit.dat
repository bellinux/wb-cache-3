40|$|Nursing Procedures of <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Administration</b> to Newborns The diploma {{thesis is}} to outline the current {{perspective}} of oxygen therapy of newborns who need highly specialized care {{as early as}} {{in the delivery room}} and subsequently in intensive and resuscitation care units of perinatologic centres. The research in the diploma thesis is focused on the assessment of the level of implementation of recommendations of the Czech Neonatology Society concerning <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> on all levels of neonatal care. The theoretical part addresses the first treatment and evaluation of a newborn. Then the reasons leading to <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> are discussed as well as the methods of oxygen application in the delivery room and intensive and resuscitation care units. Being at the forefront, oxygen {{is one of the most}} often administered medicines. Inadequate use of oxygen as a medicine increases the risk of complications for the newborn. The delivery and the first weeks after the birth rank among the crucial periods of every child. Adherence to the recommended procedures improves the outlooks of premature newborns for leading quality life. The objective of the thesis is to ascertain the level of implementation of recommendations of the Czech Neonatology Society concerning <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> on all levels of neonatal care. The research was quantitative and used the questionnaire technique. The author created one kind of the questionnaire for the selected research set. The set consisted of nurses working in neonatal wards of selected hospitals. A total of 65 questions were created to ascertain the level of implementation of recommendations of the Czech Neonatology Society concerning <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> on all levels of neonatal care. The research set consisted of 184 respondents. In order to attain the objective, the following hypotheses were raised: H 1 : Nurses know the current recommendations for <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> to newborns. H 2 : Delivery rooms have sufficient technical equipment for <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> to newborns. H 3 : Nurses are theoretically and practically trained for situations requiring <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> to newborns. H 4 : Clearly formulated rules of oxygen therapy are available for nurses in a written form in a well visible place in the delivery room. Based on the statistically processed results, the first three hypotheses have been confirmed. The fourth hypothesis was disconfirmed. The objective of the thesis has been attained. The research results may be used for better understanding of the issue of <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> to newborns in a hypoxic condition with regard to the findings of its toxicity. In order to secure adherence to the recommendations for <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> to newborns, it is appropriate to create a nursing procedure and standard and secure its availability in every delivery room and station...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} intranasal <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> on blood gas variables and outcome in neonatal calves with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 20 neonatal calves with RDS. PROCEDURES: Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)), arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) before and after intranasal <b>administration</b> of <b>oxygen</b> were analyzed. RESULTS: There were significant increases in PaO(2) and SaO(2) in the first 24 hours after <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> was begun, with mean +/- SD PaO(2) increasing from 38. 4 +/- 8. 8 mm Hg to 58. 7 +/- 17. 8 mm Hg during the first 3 hours of treatment. Calves with PaO(2) > 55 mm Hg within the first 12 hours after <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> was begun had a significantly higher survival rate (9 / 10) than did calves that did not reach this threshold (4 / 10). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that intranasal <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> was a simple method of improving blood gas variables in neonatal calves with RDS and that PaO(2) could be used to predict outcome...|$|R

Arterial oxygen concentration was estimated by transcutaneous oxygen measurement. Both methods of <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> resulted in increased levels of oxygen during surgery, with the nasal mask being more effective than the nasal cannula for raising oxygen levels. Intravenous premedication with the combination of diazepam and fentanyl resulted in less increase in oxygen levels.

30|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigated}} <b>Oxygen</b> therapy <b>administration</b> {{in terms of}} importance, limitations, and global burden of hypoxaemia. We provided a medical background about hypoxia and hypoxemia by explaining the difference between hypoxia and hypoxemia, defining the different sources causing hypoxia, classifying hypoxia into four different types based on causes, and describing how hypoxemia can be detected and measured. Furthermore, we defined the <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> process, and provided the benefits of automated <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> process on healthcare service and hypoxaemic patient’s life by having a PAOAS. To address the aforementioned needs and provide the hypoxaemic patient with continuous administered oxygen therapy at hospital, pre-clinic, and home settings, we introduced a prototype model for the PAOAS. The developed prototype consisted of two subsystems that communicate wirelessly using Bluetooth technology: an Oxygen Reader Subsystem, and Automated Adjustment Oxygen Delivery Subsystem. The prototype model measures the SpO_ 2 and consequently adjusts the amount of supplemental oxygen that is delivered to the patient accordingly using simple <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> algorithm. The measurements for SpO_ 2, and heart rate from our system showed strong agreements with the measurements from a commercial Pulse Oximeter. We expect to achieve higher reading accuracy after calibrating our system based on experimental measurements. Our final product will be small, the Oxygen Reader Subsystem will be wearable earlobe device and the Automated Adjustment Oxygen Delivery Subsystem will be more intelligent by implementing more robust <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> process that could help in accelerating the weaning process for patient who needs oxygen therapy for short-term.|$|R

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to audit current {{practices}} on oxygen prescription in the Emergency Department (ED), and on accurate <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> in the wards of Mater Dei Hospital. Method: Two hundred and forty eight adult patients attending the ED with diagnoses most likely to require oxygen therapy (mainly cardio-respiratory conditions) were randomly selected during 5 winter weeks. Data were collected on oxygen saturation, arterial blood gases, <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> at the ED, oxygen prescription and its documentation, and <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> in wards. The z-test was used to assess statistical significance of results and Fisher’s exact test was used to determine the effect of oxygen prescription documentation in treatment charts. Results: Oxygen treatment was indicated in 85 of the 248 patients. Of these, documented <b>oxygen</b> <b>administration</b> at the ED was only present in 23. 5 % (p< 0. 0001). Formal instructions on oxygen use were documented in 85. 9 % (p< 0. 0001), however in 51. 8 % of these there were incomplete details. Only 7. 1 % of patients in whom oxygen treatment was prescribed received oxygen therapy in the wards according to instructions (p< 0. 0001). It was also found that documenting oxygen prescription in treatment charts made no significant difference to the number of patients who actually received oxygen correctly in the ward. Conclusion: This study shows that there is need for better prescription, documentation and <b>administration</b> of <b>oxygen</b> in our hospital. Introduction of simple standardized oxygen charts may ensure that oxygen prescription and monitoring in the ED is carried out properly and that these instructions are then faithfully carried out in our wards...|$|R
