[...] In an email to Time, he wrote it was [...] "a bit embarrassing that <b>our</b> <b>leadership</b> couldn't secure other sponsors three months before the Olympic Games" [...] but credited the show's host Stephen Colbert for [...] "his willingness to help out our nation's greatest athletes". [...] In return for The Colbert Report donation, long track and short track skaters had the [...] "Colbert Nation" [...] logo on their uniforms for World Cup events leading up to the 2010 Winter Games. [...] Ohno did not wear the logo because Alaska Airlines was his primary sponsor for the 2010 Games. He was also part of Oreo's Team DSRL sketch in 2011.|$|E
500|$|In {{the words}} of Nicholas C. Pano, [...] "Khrushchev {{attempted}} to transform the Bucharest Conference into a communist summit meeting {{for the purpose of}} securing the condemnation of the Chinese" [...] with Kapo being the only representative of a European party [...] "to refrain from criticizing Peking, to attack Yugoslav revisionism, and to refuse to alter his stand on the Chinese and Yugoslav issues despite Soviet pressure. Khrushchev's hopes of bringing the Albanians to heel by means of peaceful persuasion were certainly shattered by the time the Bucharest Conference had come to an end." [...] During the Conference Hoxha communicated with Kapo via radiogram, stating for instance on June 24, in response to a lengthy document distributed at the Conference by the Soviets attacking the Chinese, [...] "When you make your speech at the meeting you should declare: 'I am not authorized to make statements on these matters because <b>our</b> <b>leadership</b> knows that these matters will be discussed at the forthcoming Meeting of representatives of the parties, as we have all agreed.'...

Ibrahim Makkawi, a member of the movement and professor of Educational Psychology, explained this position further in a paper presented at the Third North American Student Conference on the Palestine Solidarity Movement at Rutgers University in October 2003, stating:We refuse to enter the Zionist Knesset, simply because it is (a) in direct contradiction with our national identity as the legitimate owners of the land, (b) it gives legitimacy to the Zionist Entity and support to its myth about democracy, (c) it is a vehicle of cooptation and fragmentation of <b>our</b> <b>leadership</b> and (d) there is virtually nothing that we can achieve through the Knesset with regard to our citizens rights that we cannot do without it." ...|$|E

Asked why he stopped fighting even {{when he did not}} receive a full pardon, Zubeidi answered [...] "because of the conflict between Fatah and Hamas. Look, it's perfectly clear to me that we won't be able to defeat Israel. My aim was for us, by means of the resistance, to get a message out to the world.

2500|$|A {{few days}} after the {{military}} invasion of Iraq, O'Brien sent March 25, 2003 an explicit letter to US Catholic military chaplains, writing [...] "Given the complexity of factors involved, many of which understandably remain confidential, it is altogether appropriate for members of our armed forces to presume the integrity of <b>our</b> <b>leadership</b> and its judgments, and therefore to carry out their military duties in good conscience (nota : [...] "our leadership" [...] is not referring to the Pope)... It is to be hoped that all factors which have led to our intervention will eventually be made public, and... will shed helpful light upon our President's decision". Knowing to be a target for Catholic war opponents as increasingly distancing himself from the Pope's sayings and from some statements expressed at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops ("A preemptive war against Iraq is an unjust war"), O'Brien wrote this letter without endorsing the motives of the war. However, it is acknowledged that the proponents of the Iraqi war cause were comforted by his positions. Nevertheless, after the war has started, his spiritual direction proved to be efficient in helping calm the doubts of soldiers, advising them that they can safely leave the responsibility for moral decision-making to the Government. On several occasions, US Army chaplains including O'Brien were asked by Catholics [...] "to call on all Catholic soldiers to leave Iraq" [...] : O'Brien gave flat refusals for discussions. O'Brien thinks that, to make Just War, the role of chaplains becomes essential to help soldiers perform their fighting duties, to ease relationships with local populations and to avoid gross misconducts (such as torturing in the Abu Ghraib prison). In such a context, O'Brien is often complaining that the paucity of priests serving in active duty in the US Army is nearing disaster.|$|E

40|$|Distance Learning Notes. There {{is little}} doubt about the {{importance}} of leadership in all or-ganizations in the complex and ever-changing context of the twenty-first century. The cult of leadership is especially visible to us now as the Americans, the French, and the Russians crank up their respective presidential leadership campaigns. But closer to home and the workplace, it is easy to think about leadership as being something for which someone else, higher up, is responsible. Surely our problems exist because the president, the provost, my department head, or my colleagues just aren’t being effective leaders! However, crowd sourcing, the viral influence of individual blogs and YouTube posts, and the power of tweets and Facebook posts force all of us to confront and take responsibility for <b>our</b> own <b>leadership</b> capacities. We can exercise a great deal of <b>leadership</b> in <b>our</b> homes, schools, and workplaces, but that leadership demands commitment, energy, and risk. All of us, as distance education researchers and practitioners, are challenged to maximize and optimize <b>our</b> respective <b>leadership</b> contributions. <b>Our</b> collective mission, to expand oppor-tunity and to increase the development and effective use of knowledge, demands that we be leaders and develop <b>our</b> individual <b>leadership</b> capacities. We hope this new series will help all of us to become more effective leaders. We welcome new articles from both students and practitioners for this series.
