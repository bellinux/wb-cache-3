5|$|Jersey is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British Isles {{where the}} agile frog Rana dalmatina is found. The {{remaining}} population of agile frogs on Jersey {{is very small}} and is restricted to the south west of the island. The species {{is the subject of}} an ongoing programme to save it from extinction in Jersey via a collaboration between States of Jersey, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and Jersey Amphibian and Reptile Group (JARG), with support and sponsorship from several other organisations. The programme includes captive breeding and release, public awareness and habitat restoration activities.|$|E

5|$|The Gram-negative {{bacterial}} disease brucellosis occasionally affects elk in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. where {{the disease is}} still known to exist. In domesticated cattle, brucellosis causes infertility, abortions and reduced milk production. It is transmitted to humans as undulant fever, producing flu-like symptoms which may last for years. Though bison {{are more likely to}} transmit the disease to other animals, elk inadvertently transmitted brucellosis to horses in Wyoming and cattle in Idaho. Researchers are attempting to eradicate the disease through vaccinations and herd management measures, which are expected to be successful. Nevetheless, research has been ongoing since 2002, and a successful vaccine has yet to be developed as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|Many of Gibraltar's fortifications {{were already}} {{redundant}} {{well before the}} British garrison was withdrawn from the territory in the 1990s, and the rapid military rundown in the 1980s and the 1990s left the civilian authorities with {{a large amount of}} surplus military property. Many of the best-preserved fortifications are in the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, a conservation area that covers about 40% of the area of Gibraltar. A few of the Upper Rock batteries have been preserved intact; all three of the 5.25-inch guns at Princess Anne's Battery are still in place, making it the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world where a complete 5.25-inch battery can still be seen. The 9.2 inch guns at Breakneck, Lord Airey's and O'Hara's Batteries are still in situ and can now be visited. Elsewhere, most of the ordnance has been removed. Two surviving 6-inch guns remain at Devil's Gap Battery, one of which is the gun that engaged a German U-boat in August 1917. At Napier of Magdala Battery one of the two 100-ton RML 17.72 inch guns is still in situ and has been restored, along with a 3.7 inch quick-firing anti-aircraft gun. The site is now run by the Gibraltar Tourist Board in conjunction with the Nature Reserve.|$|E
