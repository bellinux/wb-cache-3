50|$|The AARNet4 {{national}} network comprises high capacity <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>transmission</b> paths between switching centres {{in major cities}} from Cairns to Perth as well as branch lines to Darwin, Hobart and several other locations. Because optical fibre repair times are long, the backbone network follows two physically diverse paths. As at late 2013, capacity on each leg of the routed network was between 10 and 100 gigabit per second (Gbit/s). Starting with only 48 kbit/s national backbone capacity in 1990, this reflects a similarly rapid exponential growth rate as for AARNet's international capacity.|$|E

It purchased 2 fibres from PTC in the main optical fibre backbone and equipped it with 622 Mbps SDH system. It expanded its exchanges in different cities {{to gain access to}} its customers along with laying of copper cable. These exchanges were converted into transit exchanges to provision long distance services on NTC network and to have direct interconnects with cellular and other operators.|$|E
50|$|The strain margin {{requirements}} tend to favour cable designs using multiple loose tubes. Tight-buffer cable designs {{do not provide}} sufficient strain margin and the <b>optical</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>transmission</b> performance is compromised under strong winds, heavy ice accretions and at high temperatures. In cables based on a single loose tube design, the optical fibres have too much freedom of movement along the cable axis. Consequently, mechanical {{energy in the form}} of wind-induced vibration of the host conductor causes the optical fibres to move gradually ‘downhill’ and allowing the excess fibre length to collect in the low point of the span. This uneven distribution of excess fibre length compromises the optical performance of the cable with increased optical attenuation at low temperatures in the relatively crowded sections of tube in the middle of spans and at high temperatures where the fibres are under strain at the high sections close to the towers. These problems are worse on longer spans.|$|E
