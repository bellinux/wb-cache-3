25|$|The {{currency}} devaluation of large notes in 1959 saw the {{official exchange rate}} devalued to Rp 45 as of August 1959. Despite this, the fundamental issues with the fixed exchange rate system and severe import controls (which saw cotton mills running at only 11% of capacity {{due to lack of}} imported raw materials) were not addressed, and smuggling grew, often backed by the army, while assets were moved offshore by <b>overinvoicing.</b>|$|E
40|$|Whereas {{the policy}} {{incentives}} {{were designed to}} promote exports from Pakistan, the incentive system instead led to illicit export practices, i. e., export <b>overinvoicing</b> due to the weaknesses of implementation. Such practices resulted in a significant financial loss {{to the country and}} undermined the effectiveness of the export-promoting policy. This paper has determined the presence of <b>overinvoicing</b> of exports in Pakistan and the geographic and product-wise patterns in export <b>overinvoicing.</b> The paper has applied the ‘partner-country data comparison ’ technique. Empirical findings confirm the strong presence of export <b>overinvoicing</b> across trading partner countries and products. This conclusion is further supported by the evidence of {{a significant difference between the}} duty-drawback rate and the premium on foreign exchange in the kerb market. Convincing presence of export <b>overinvoicing</b> is the basis for a set of policy recommendations made in the paper. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} divided in two parts. The {{first is a}} {{theoretical}} development {{of the question of}} under or <b>overinvoicing</b> of exports and imports {{within the context of a}} model of choice between risky and secure assets. The second part attempts to ascertain the empirical evidence for the Brazilian economy. It is concluded that the hypothesis that the black market dollar premium plays a role in this process can not be rejected. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{questions}} {{the impact of}} protectionist and liberal trade policies on foreign trade data discrepancies. Official records of Turkish exports and imports data are compared with data of the major partner countries (OECD, Germany, USA, Italy, Switzerland, France, UK, Benelux) for the period 1970 - 91. An analysis of detailed data reveals that the patterns of discrepancies are not common to all countries in the pre- and post-liberal years (i. e. before and after 1980). Hence, the Turkish case does not provide full support for the expectation that faked invoicing disappears with the liberalization of the trade regime. In addition, Switzerland emerges as a very exceptional trade partner, as compared with other partners, for both imports and exports. Turkey's exports to Switzerland are overinvoiced up to 700 % until 1985, the rate of <b>overinvoicing</b> decreases to 200 % after then. On the other hand, imports from Switzerland are overinvoiced up to 250 % until again 1985. <b>Overinvoicing</b> of imports disappears {{in the wake of}} 1983 December measures. A comparison of imports and exports data of Switzerland with data of the above stated countries reveals that Turkey is also an exceptional partner for Switzerland. The patterns of discrepancies in foreign trade data might be closely related to capital transactions, noting that Switzerland offers the world favourable conditions for financial transactions. We also note that general patterns can be related to those of some specific commodities which might act as a means of transferring capital because the details of the trade regime regulations concerning them can be easily identified. Yet, generally speaking, the consequences of policy implementations do not straightforwardly match with expectations. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} extent and the {{direction}} of trade misinvoicing {{in the context of}} the new policy environment that has affected the Turkish economy in the post 1990 period. Utilizing bilateral partner country statistics between Turkey and its major trading partners, we observe persisting export <b>overinvoicing</b> and an oscillating pattern of import misinvoicing at the aggregate level. Country-specific data reveal different patterns. As opposed to the general trend in misinvoicing, exports to China are underinvoiced and imports are overinvoiced. We also analyze how the liberalization policies and the customs union agreement with the European Union countries affect trade misinvoicing. We find that, with trade liberalization policies, import misinvoicing has decreased at the aggregate level. However, contrary to the expectations, customs union agreement did not help decrease the extent of trade misinvoicing in Turkey. ...|$|E
40|$|The Bretton Woods system {{broke down}} in 1971 and since that time the {{developing}} countries have faced serious problems in keeping their exchange rates stable. Since 1975, the situation has become more difficult with acclerating inflation rates in many industrial countries. To meet these problems, the major industrial countries opted for free floating currencies and the developing countries opted for either pegging their currencies to some major currencies or fixing the exchange rate of their currencies vis-a- vis a basket of major currencies. In addition to exchange rate problems, the developing countries also suffered from chronic monetary disequilibrium, which is reflected in domestic inflation. As inflation has eroded the competitive edge of exports, the balance of payments deteriorated, and the fixed exchange rate was overvalued, generating such illegal practices as underinvoicing exports and <b>overinvoicing</b> imports. These phenomena support the monetarist proposition that a domestic monetary disequilibrium will have spillover effects on both the balance of payments and on the exchange rate...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{show how}} the various methods {{commonly}} used to measure capital flight produce vastly different estimates (with a 100 percent difference between the lowest and the highest, in Mexico's case). They {{emphasize the importance of}} the conceptual approach to its measurement. First of all, they did not try to separate normal capital flows from capital flight. A capital shift outward because of expected taxation is as much a response to anticipated developments in rate of return as is a shift out in response to lower interest rates at home. Nor is it satisfactory to directly measure capital flight by taking short-term asset changes and the balance of errors and omissions from the balance of payments. Neither is necessarily related to the unreported private accumulation of foreign assets. They chose the residual approach, which assumes that capital inflows in the form of increases in external indebtedness and foreign direct investment should finance either the current account or reserve accumulation; any shortfall in reported use can be attributed to capital flight. Implementing the residual approach requires careful data selection and several adjustments. The authors contend that: introducing debt stock data into the analysis - instead of the changes in debt recorded directly in the balance of payments - requires many difficult adjustments and should be avoided; foreign asset changes of public corporations must be subtracted; rather than eliminate interest received on foreign assets from the current account, as some have done, earnings on private assets held abroad should be considered part of the flight capital that might have been repatriated, given different incentives and macroeconomic conditions; and the effect on capital flight of the faking of trade invoices should be assessed, since import <b>overinvoicing</b> and export underinvoicing can be used to channel capital abroad. They demonstrate the empirical importance of these choices with a new set of capital flight estimates for Mexico, based on the recommendations they present. They contrast the results of this approach with those of other approaches, to demonstrate the effect of conceptual choices.
