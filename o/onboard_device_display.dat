30|$|Similarly to CBTC systems, a PIS {{consists}} of <b>onboard</b> <b>devices,</b> ground equipment, and a network. <b>Onboard</b> <b>devices</b> include cameras, screens, and PIS MSs, while ground equipment includes a video server, a monitor center and PIS APs. PIS train-ground communications ensure passengers onboard can get real-time {{information from the}} video server, and the monitor center can real-timely receive monitoring pictures of the train interior and the station.|$|R
30|$|Suppose a packet, {{originating}} from an <b>onboard</b> <b>device</b> with IP address 2001 :db 8 : 1 : 1 :: 33 (see Figure 9) is destined for a wayside server with IP address 2001 :db 8 :a::a. Just {{as in the}} previous scenario, the packet first needs to be routed to the onboard standard gateway, which is the MCE with IP address 2001 :db 8 : 1 : 1 :: 1 (see Figure 9). The <b>onboard</b> <b>device</b> knows this via fixed configuration or via e.g., DHCPv 6. The <b>onboard</b> <b>device</b> then resolves the link layer address for 2001 :db 8 : 1 : 1 :: 1 (via neighbor discovery [76]), and the packet is sent over the onboard network (e.g., via Wi-Fi or Ethernet) to the MCE.|$|R

30|$|There {{are many}} ways to support {{mobility}} for the nodes on board of the train. In this article, we assumed that the network mobility is managed solely by the MCE on board of the train and that the <b>onboard</b> <b>devices</b> are unaware {{of the fact that they}} are part of a moving network. Moreover, all third party communicating nodes are also unaware of any mobility of the <b>onboard</b> <b>devices.</b> Therefore, all data traffic is routed to the WCE at the wayside. This way, mobility is transparent in the complete system (which was reflected in the addressing scheme in Figure 9) and it allows to centrally optimize bandwidth capacity, prioritize some data traffic flows etc.|$|R
50|$|A train-type sign (列車種別表示灯, ressha shubetsu hyōjitō), {{transmitted}} from an <b>onboard</b> <b>device,</b> {{is attached to}} a starting signal and shows the type of train that can pass it. It is mainly used by large private railway companies in stations with passing loops, express stops or turn-back stations. The sign type depends on the operator; character and number signs and symbols are used.|$|R

30|$|When {{the packet}} {{arrives at the}} MCE, the Marker will assign a value to the Traffic Class and the Flow Label field (see Figure 5). When the packet arrives at the Accelerator, an {{additional}} change in the packet header occurs, which was not applicable for unreliable traffic flows (Section 7.2). The Accelerator will send a TCP ACK to the <b>onboard</b> <b>device</b> (TCP ACK spoofing, see Section 5.1. 3) and will convert the TCP payload into raw data, encapsulated in e.g., UDP, in order to terminate the TCP mechanisms of each independent traffic flow here.|$|R
40|$|Power system {{interface}} with electrified railways (ER), auxiliary power, hybrid trains, electromagnetic interface (EMI) and traction are reviewed {{in this paper}} for diesel electric trains and ERs. Auxiliary power supply is a low voltage AC/DC power supply for <b>onboard</b> <b>devices</b> with an important consideration for safety equipment. In diesel electric railways because of variable train speed, a sort of compromise is taking place between traction and auxiliary power which usually affects auxiliary equipment performance. Hybrid train's energy storage unit can compensate this deficiency. Other challenges in railways are their compatibility with power and communication systems...|$|R
