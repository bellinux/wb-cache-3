500|$|In Pinafore, Sullivan {{exploits}} minor keys for comic effect, {{for instance}} in [...] "Kind Captain, I've important information". Further, he achieves a musical surprise when he uses the subdominant minor in [...] "Sorry her lot". The musicologist Gervase Hughes {{was impressed with the}} introduction to the opening chorus which includes [...] "a rousing nautical tune... in a key of no nonsense, C major... a modulation to the mediant minor, where to <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> a plaintive oboe gives us the first verse of [...] "Sorry her lot" [...] in 2/4 [...] After this closes on the local dominant B major the violins (still in 2/4) introduce us to Little Buttercup... meeting her under these conditions one would hardly expect her to blossom out later as a queen of the waltz." [...] He continues, [...] "the bassoon and basses... assert vigorously who is the Captain of the Pinafore... in the improbable key of A flat minor.... Buttercup makes a last despairing attempt to make herself heard in D flat minor, but the others have never known that such an outlandish key existed. So in a flash they all go back to C major on a good old 6/4".|$|E
500|$|According to Vig, Not Your Kind of People evokes ambient vibes of Garbage's {{first two}} albums, Garbage and Version 2.0: [...] "There's lots of {{elements}} of things we've always loved: noisy guitars, big electronic beats, atmospheric film moments", {{adding that the}} band [...] "wanted to make a record sound like something {{that we want to}} hear when we're driving the car." [...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs to blow out a little bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave a lot of the performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, we sort of throw paint at the wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and what we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's going to end up sounding like Garbage. I think we have a strong sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio. Much to <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> there hasn't been another band like ours since we came off the road." ...|$|E
2500|$|An early {{visitor to}} Torquay in 1794 is {{recorded}} as saying “Instead {{of the poor}} uncomfortable village we had expected, how great was <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> at seeing a pretty range of neat new buildings, fitted up for summer visitors, visitors here can enjoy carriage rides, bathing, retirement and a most romantic situation.” Another early visitor exclaimed [...] "It is not England, but a bit of sunny Italy taken bodily from its rugged coast and placed here amid the green places and the pleasant pastoral lanes of beautiful Devon’." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in, Sherlock! Come in, sir," [...] said he blandly, {{smiling at}} <b>our</b> <b>surprised</b> faces. [...] "You don't expect such energy from me, do you, Sherlock? But somehow this case attracts me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I kept my lips shut, of course. The {{signal for}} the Indians to attack was never given. Instead, the bugle-calls of the {{relieving}} force for which my ears had thirsted so long, burst out, terrifying like {{the call of}} the Last Day to <b>our</b> <b>surprised</b> enemies.|$|R

2500|$|On March 17, 2007, Plame {{testified before}} the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. She was asked how she learned of Novak's {{reference}} to her in his column. Plame told the committee [...] "I found out {{very early in the}} morning when my husband came in and dropped the newspaper on the bed and said, 'He did it'.... We had indications in the week prior that Mr. Novak knew my identity and my true employer. And I of course alerted my superiors at the agency, and I was told, don't worry; we'll take care of it. And it was much to <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> that we read about this July 14.... I believe, and this is what I've read, that the then-spokesman, Mr. Harlow, spoke directly with Mr. Novak and said something along the lines of, don't go with this; don't do this. I don't know exactly what he said, but he clearly communicated the message that Mr. Novak should not publish my name." ...|$|E
60|$|And now, to <b>our</b> <b>surprise,</b> we were accosted by {{an eager}} and servile throng.|$|E

6000|$|<b>Our</b> <b>surprised</b> {{story now}} finds itself {{for a moment}} among very famous events and personages, and {{hanging on to the}} skirts of history. When the eagles of Napoleon Bonaparte, the Corsican upstart, were flying from Provence, where they had perched after a brief sojourn in Elba, and from steeple to steeple until they reached the towers of Notre Dame, I wonder whether the Imperial birds had any eye for a little corner of the parish of Bloomsbury, London, which you might have thought so quiet, that even the {{whirring}} and flapping of those mighty wings would pass unobserved there? ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Our</b> first <b>surprise</b> was {{the casting}} because the {{characters}} are magnificent! The film is amazingly accomplished and the scenes succeed {{with a lot of}} sensitivity (...) Both actresses are astonishing, the mother Sana (Louise Portal) and the daughter Dounia (Renée Thomas) in the role of two conflictual characters superbly interpreted. M.H.|$|R
60|$|While {{making these}} remarks, one drew near {{at a brisk}} trot, who, Mr. Downright observed, eagerly desired <b>our</b> acquaintance. <b>Surprised</b> at his pretending to know such a fact without any {{previous}} communication, I took the liberty of asking why he thought that we were the particular objects of the other's haste.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've <b>surprised</b> <b>our</b> secret," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "but anyhow, Stephen {{was going}} to tell you to-day. We were married the day before yesterday." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{answer was}} communicated, and {{we waited for}} {{its effect on the}} Indians. To <b>our</b> <b>surprise,</b> several of them soon {{gathered}} around, evidently regarding us both with interest and respect.|$|E
60|$|Just then {{we heard}} our father wishing the other gentlemen good- night, and to <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> Clarence opened the door, though he was deadly white and with dew {{starting}} on his forehead.|$|E
60|$|These, as well {{as other}} {{symptoms}} of refinement, somewhat abated <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> at the reserve of the little Loo; her parents, doubtless, were magnates in Partoowye, and she herself was an heiress.|$|E
60|$|Next inning, after old man Hathaway had baffled the Canadians {{with his}} wide, tantalizing curves, my {{predictions}} {{began to be}} verified. Snead rapped one high and far to deep right field. To <b>our</b> infinite <b>surprise,</b> however, the right fielder ran with fleetness that made our own Deerfoot seem slow, and he got under the ball and caught it.|$|R
60|$|Selim. Most gracious sire, I know not. <b>Our</b> guard <b>surprised</b> him {{wandering}} {{without the}} camp,--alone, unarmed, save {{with a single}} sword; young, and I think a Greek. Abdallah seized him as a spy, and led him hither to await thy royal will. He doth refuse all question, demanding to be led before thee, where he will unfold his errand.|$|R
40|$|The author {{presents}} {{his personal}} {{response to the}} newly found poems of Marulić,discovered at Glasgow by Darko Novaković. In {{sharp contrast to the}} stereotypical picture of Marulić as an exclusively religious poet, the new poems, to <b>our</b> great <b>surprise,</b> show him as a brilliant satirist, teasing, even bold jester and erotic poet who, in spite of his old age, wittily plays on sensuality...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you like}} it, dear? This is <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> {{for you and}} Jack, and here we mean to have good times together," [...] said Mrs. Minot, who had stood quietly enjoying the effect of her work.|$|E
60|$|Certain it is, however, {{that the}} {{afternoon}} was well spent before {{we saw him}} coming up the road, and <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> can well be imagined when we learned that he had with him as companion none other than Horry Sims.|$|E
60|$|To <b>our</b> <b>surprise,</b> Cecile did {{not seem}} so much dismayed at {{returning}} under the power of her tyrant as we had expected. It was doing what her husband wished, and living where she would have news of him, and perhaps sometimes see him.|$|E
6000|$|It did [...] "pay" [...] {{in other}} ways than the mere {{pleasure}} of it. There was always a better feeling between the Roaders and the Hillites thereafter. The big brothers of the little girls, to whom <b>our</b> Christmas <b>surprise</b> {{had been such a}} treat, thought it worthwhile to bury the hatchet, and quarrels between the two villages became things of the past.|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{landed at}} the Villa at twelve o'clock this morning," [...] Draconmeyer replied. [...] "You know, of course, {{of the little}} <b>surprise</b> <b>our</b> young American friend had {{prepared}} for Mr. Grex?" ...|$|R
60|$|Placing him in {{one corner}} where he might sit with {{his back against the}} boards, the old sailor went outside and drove the mule in the {{direction}} of the tavern, himself following until he was lost to view, much to <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> and disquietude.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye ain't got no bunk to spare, you boys, hev ye?" [...] asked Mosby, evasively, {{glancing at}} Percy Briggs {{without looking at}} the stranger.

60|$|The frog, as before, {{refused to}} make any reply; so our friend lay for some time chuckling and making faces at it. While thus engaged he {{happened}} to look up, and to <b>our</b> <b>surprise</b> as well as alarm we observed that he suddenly turned as pale as death.|$|E

50|$|Gordon's {{report on}} the {{bombardment}} stated that:A little before sunset the squadron anchored just out of gunshot; the bomb vessels at once took up their position to cover the frigates in the projected attack at daylight next morning and began throwing shells until about 7:00pm. The garrison, to <b>our</b> great <b>surprise,</b> retreated from the fort; and a short time afterward Fort Washington was blown up.|$|R
