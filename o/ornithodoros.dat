5|$|The Ixodidae {{contains}} over 700 {{species of}} hard ticks with a scutum or hard shield, which the Argasidae lack. The Argasidae contains about 200 species; the genera accepted as of 2010 are Antricola, Argas, Nothoaspis, <b>Ornithodoros</b> and Otobius. They have no scutum, and the capitulum (mouth and feeding parts) is concealed beneath the body. The family Nuttalliellidae contains {{only a single}} species, Nuttalliella namaqua, a tick found in southern Africa from Tanzania to Namibia and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} bird families, {{pelicans}} {{are susceptible to}} a variety of parasites. Specialist feather lice of the genus Piagetella are found in the pouches of all species of pelican, but are otherwise only known from New World and Antarctic cormorants. Avian malaria is carried by the mosquito Culex pipens, and high densities of these biting insects may force pelican colonies to be abandoned. Leeches may attach to the vent or sometimes the inside of the pouch. A study of the parasites of the American white pelican found 75 different species, including tapeworms, flukes, flies, fleas, ticks and nematodes. Many of these do little harm, but flies may be implicated in the death of nestlings, particularly if they are weak or unwell, and the soft tick <b>Ornithodoros</b> capensis sometimes causes adults to desert the nest. Many pelican parasites are found in other bird groups, but several lice are very host-specific.|$|E
25|$|ABV {{was found}} in the <b>Ornithodoros</b> genus of soft-bodied tick in seabird nests in {{southern}} Texas, USA, in 1975; it was the first member of the genus to be found in North America. No natural vertebrate host has been identified, but the virus is highly pathogenic to mice in laboratory infections. The virus particle is spherical or ovoid, with a range of sizes, from 75nm × 85nm to 120nm × 140nm. The genome has six RNA segments. It is most similar to UPOV, with some similarity to THOV and JOSV.|$|E
25|$|UPOV {{was first}} {{isolated}} on Upolu Cay in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia in 1966, from soft-bodied ticks {{of the species}} <b>Ornithodoros</b> capensis associated with the sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscatus). No natural vertebrate host has been identified, but the virus is highly pathogenic to mice in laboratory infections. The virion can either be spherical, with a diameter in the range 75–95nm, or slightly ovoid, {{with a range of}} dimensions from 75nm × 85nm to 105nm × 120nm. The genome has six RNA segments. It is most similar to ABV, with some similarity to THOV and JOSV.|$|E
500|$|Other ticks, {{mainly the}} Argasidae, are [...] "nidicolous", finding hosts in their nests or burrows, and in caves {{in the case}} of bats. They use the same stimuli as non-nidicolous species to {{identify}} hosts, with body heat and odors often being the main factors. Many of them feed primarily on birds, though some <b>Ornithodoros,</b> for example, feed on mammals. Both groups feed rapidly, typically biting painfully and drinking their fill within minutes. None of the species stick to the host in the way that hard ticks do. Unlike the Ixodidae that have no fixed dwelling place except on the host, they live in sand or in crevices near animal dens or nests, or in human dwellings where they come out nightly to attack roosting birds, or emerge when they detect carbon dioxide in the breath of their hosts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, several {{workers on}} Laysan {{contracted}} a feverish illness previously unknown there or anywhere else. It affected workers on Laysan in {{varying levels of}} severity: one woman was evacuated for persistent fever, but others exhibited very mild symptoms. Cedric Yoshimoto, of the University of Hawaii at Mānoa School of Public Health, wrote that [...] "surveillance has identified a newly-described illness of humans termed 'Laysan fever (LF)' It is associated with bites of the seabird tick <b>Ornithodoros</b> capensis... joins {{a short list of}} human illnesses associated with seabird colonies..." [...] The symptoms of Q fever overlap significantly with those of Laysan fever, and scientists have speculated as to their possible common causes.|$|E

50|$|ASFV is a large, {{double-stranded}} DNA virus which replicates in the cytoplasm {{of infected}} cells, {{and is the}} only member of the Asfarviridae family. ASFV infects domestic pigs, warthogs and bushpigs, as well as soft ticks (<b>Ornithodoros),</b> which likely act as a vector.|$|E

50|$|African {{swine fever}} virus (ASFV) is the causative agent of African swine fever (ASF). The virus causes a {{haemorrhagic}} fever with high mortality rates in pigs, but persistently infects its natural hosts, warthogs, bushpigs, and soft ticks of the <b>Ornithodoros</b> genus, with no disease signs.|$|E
50|$|The {{virus is}} thought to be derived from a virus of soft tick (genus <b>Ornithodoros)</b> that infects wild swine, {{including}} giant forest hogs (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni), warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus), and bushpigs (Potamochoerus porcus). In these wild hosts, infection is generally asymptomatic. This virus appears to have evolved around 1700 AD.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ornithodoros</b> spp {{are found}} {{worldwide}} in semi-arid regions, living in burrows, caves, dens, cliffsides, and bird colonies. O. savignyi and O. coriaceus are exceptional in having eyes. O. coriaceus occurs under hillside scrub oak from northern California and Nevada to Mexico, in deer beds under trees {{and in the}} lee of large rocks. O. gurneyi favours tree-shaded sand in the deserts of Australia, resting places of kangaroos and people. O. porcinus is found on warthogs, bushpigs and other pig species and occurs throughout Africa in suitable habitats - it plays a role in transmitting the virus causing African swine fever which in 2013 was found 35 km north of Pretoria. A salticid spider, Phidippus rimator, has been recorded from northern California as predating <b>Ornithodoros</b> coriaceus and is only the second predator recorded for this species.|$|E
50|$|A {{naturally}} occurring inhibitor of factor Xa was first reported in 1971 by Spellman et al. from the dog hookworm. In 1987, Tuszynski et al. discovered antistasin, which was {{isolated from the}} extracts of Mexican leech, Haementeria officinalis. Soon after this, another {{naturally occurring}} inhibitor, tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP) was isolated from the extract of tick <b>Ornithodoros</b> moubata.|$|E
50|$|Johnston Atoll {{virus was}} first {{isolated}} in 1964 from soft-bodied <b>Ornithodoros</b> capensis ticks infesting the brown noddy tern (Anous stolidus) from Sand Island, Johnston Atoll, in the Pacific. Its range also includes Hawaii, Australia and New Zealand. The virus {{has been shown}} to be transmitted between vertebrates by ticks. In the laboratory, it causes severe disease in mice and chicks.|$|E
