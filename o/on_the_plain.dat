5|$|Aerial {{reconnaissance}} {{reported that}} no defensive works {{of any kind}} had been identified <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> or covering the approaches to it, apart from German troops, garrisoned at the Yildirim Army Group headquarters of Otto Liman von Sanders at Nazareth. At 12:30 on 19 September Liman von Sanders ordered the 13th Depot Regiment at Nazareth and the military police, {{a total of six}} companies and 12 machine guns, to occupy Lejjun and defend the Musmus Pass.|$|E
5|$|Each sermon {{begins with}} a scriptural passage that {{reinforces}} the ideas that {{will be discussed in}} the sermon and each was preceded with the same opening prayer (which Swift also delivered). The sermons are plainly written and apply a common-sense approach to contemporary moral issues in Dublin. Swift patterned his sermons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> style of the Book of Common Prayer and the Church of Ireland Authorized Version of the Bible.|$|E
5|$|For the {{expression}} of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as can, may, will, shall and the past tense forms could, might, would, should. There is also a subjunctive and an imperative mood, both based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular -s), and which is used in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: It is important that he run every day; imperative Run!).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plains</b> depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hills also <b>on</b> vital {{questions}} like flood control. Flood control in <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> requires for soil conservation and afforestation in the hills. <b>The</b> hills depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> for markets for their produce. They depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> even for food grains because of limited cultivable {{land in the}} hill.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> primary {{constraint}} <b>on</b> agriculture <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Plains</b> is that precipitation {{is often}} deficient for growing maize, the primary crop of Indian farmers. In addition, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northern Great <b>Plains</b> <b>the</b> growing season is short. Agriculture <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plains</b> {{seems to have}} had an ebb and flow, advancing westward into the drier areas in favorable wet periods and retreating in drier periods. The periodic abundance or scarcity of bison was also a factor in human settlements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plains.</b> <b>The</b> animal was an important food resource for Plains people.|$|R

5|$|Further inland, another serious {{attack was}} made on the British lines of {{communication}} from Ramleh by units of both the Ottoman 16th Division <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> and the 19th Division in the hills. The aim of this counterattack was the destruction of two British Empire divisions in the hills by cutting their lines of communication.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stephen Breyer {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on April 19, 2004. Breyer believed that the question the Court needed to answer was whether Congress had the authority to relax restrictions that had been imposed on an Indian tribe's inherent sovereignty. He noted that the intent of Congress was clear, not only based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> language of the statute, but also from its legislative history.|$|E
5|$|Pyrrhus {{attempted}} to goad Antigonus into fighting a pitched battle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> {{in front of}} Argos but the Macedonian king was unmoved. The Argives sent ambassadors to both kings, beseeching them to respect the city's neutrality. Antigonus agreed to the Argives' terms and gave his son as a hostage in order to demonstrate his sincerity. While Pyrrhus agreed to retreat from Argos, he failed to give a pledge {{and as a result}} was regarded with suspicion.|$|E

5|$|Basil II was at {{that time}} in the eastern provinces of his empire, {{wintering}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> of Tarsus following his campaign against the Fatimid dynasty in Syria. On hearing of David’s death he marched north-eastward to claim the lands David had promised to the emperor. The local Georgian and Armenian nobility submitted without any serious resistance. The only notable incident occurred when a quarrel between a Georgian soldier and a Varangian Guardsman over a bale of hay developed into a major fight, involving 6,000 Varangians and taking the lives of thirty Georgian high-ranking nobles.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of 19 November, a {{thunderstorm}} followed by a drenching downpour broke over the opposing armies. In a few hours every wadi in the foothills and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> was in flood. The black soil plain, hard and firm during summer, became in these winter conditions sticky and heavy for marching and almost impassable for wheeled vehicles. The temperature, which had been hot {{during the day and}} pleasant at night, dropped rapidly to become piercingly cold. The infantrymen had been marching light in their summer uniform of twill shorts and tunics. With only one blanket (and/or a Greatcoat), this gear gave little protection from the driving rain and bitter chill.|$|E
5|$|Externally the {{architectural}} style of Leigh Court is Palladian. The house, built of Bath stone, has a hipped slate roof with a glazed and coffered area over its Great Hall. The {{appearance of the}} south-east and north-west elevations mirror each other. Each has three central bays, These project slightly {{from the rest of}} the frontage. The porticoes have of four, unfluted Ionic columns, above which are pediments <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> entablature. Ionic columns can also be found on the seven bay north-east elevation. There are two-storey service wings attached to the main house.|$|E

Souvanna called upon the U.S. for support and was answered in the affirmative by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was eager to support a rightist/neutralist alliance in Laos. In November 1963 General Maxwell D. Taylor, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had proposed that U.S. armed reconnaissance missions be conducted over Laos {{as part of a}} two phase program that would warn Hanoi of U.S. determination to support the Saigon government. The missions were to take place along North Vietnamese infiltration routes then developing in the Laotian panhandle.|$|E
5|$|Hebron Church is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> of a {{predominantly}} rural agricultural and forested area of southeastern Hampshire County, in the Cacapon River Valley. Baker Mountain, a forested, narrow anticlinal mountain ridge, rises {{west of the}} church, and the western rolling foothills of the anticlinal Great North Mountain rise east of the valley. The Cacapon River, just southeast of the church, is hidden from the church and cemetery by mature foliage. George Washington National Forest, encompassing the forested area east of the Cacapon River, is east of the church.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Torvioll, {{also known}} as the Battle of Lower Dibra, was fought on 29 June 1444 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plain</b> of Torvioll, in what is modern-day Albania. Skanderbeg was an Ottoman Albanian captain who {{decided to go back to}} his native land and take the reins of a new Albanian rebellion. He, along with 300 other Albanians {{fighting}} at the Battle of Niš, deserted the Ottoman army to head towards Krujë, which fell quickly through a subversion. He then formed the League of Lezhë, a confederation of Albanian princes united in war against the Ottoman Empire. Murad II, realizing the threat, sent one of his most experienced captains, Ali Pasha, to crush the rebellion with a force of 25,000 men.|$|E

5|$|The Gospels portray Jesus {{teaching}} in well-defined sessions, such as Matthew's Sermon on the Mount or Luke's parallel Sermon <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plain.</b> According to Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz, these teaching sessions include authentic teachings of Jesus, but the scenes were invented by the respective evangelists to frame these teachings, which {{had originally been}} recorded without context. While Jesus' miracles fit within {{the social context of}} antiquity, he defined them differently. First, he attributed them to the faith of those healed. Second, he connected them to end times prophecy.|$|E
5|$|The {{cease-fire}} {{went into}} effect on 22 February 1973. Not all of the fighting, however, had ended. This was particularly true around the town of Paksong, the last Royal Laotian stronghold on the Bolovens Plateau – the strategic high ground overlooking the Mekong River. At the request of Souvanna, nine B-52s and 12 U.S tactical fighters struck {{the outskirts of the}} town on 24 February. By mid-month, the bombers had flown 1,417 sorties and struck 286 targets in northern Laos. Once again acceding to a request from Souvanna, B-52s returned for two more days of bombing on 16 and 17 April, dropping ordnance in support of government forces under attack around Ban Tha Vieng <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plain</b> of Jars.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{asserts that}} all wild trees grow from seed or from roots. He {{mentions}} that the philosophers spoke of spontaneous generation, as when Anaxagoras claims the air contains {{the seeds of}} every plant, whereas Diogenes believed plants arose when water mixed with earth. In places like Crete, Theophrastus writes that native plants spring up if the ground is simply disturbed, and that wild trees are generally more vigorous than cultivated ones, give fruit later, and like cold and hilly terrain. He asserts that trees which can grow both on hill and plain grow better and taller when grown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plain.</b>|$|E

5|$|To {{the east}} von Falkenhayn, held his reserve force of 3rd Cavalry Division (Seventh Army's III Corps) and 19th Division (Eighth Army reserve) {{in front of}} Beit Jibrin. They waited {{throughout}} the day for the main attack to make progress before beginning their own advance, but the opportunity never eventuated. This powerful Ottoman counterattack had been contained and had not forced any rearrangement of the invading forces, whose preparations and concentration <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> were now complete. But von Falkenhayn was forced to halt his Seventh Army's attack and then {{to take away from}} it the 16th Division plus one regiment.|$|E
5|$|When Cleomenes {{heard about}} the revolt at Argos, he sent his {{stepfather}} with 2,000 men to try and save the situation. Megistonous was killed while assaulting the city, however, and the relief force retreated, leaving the Spartans in the citadel to continue resistance. Cleomenes abandoned his much stronger position at the Isthmus {{for fear of being}} encircled and left Corinth to {{fall into the hands of}} Antigonus. Cleomenes advanced his troops upon Argos and forced his way into the city, rescuing the men stuck in the citadel. He retreated to Mantinea when he saw Antigonus' army <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> outside the city.|$|E
5|$|After the {{infantry}} established {{a gap in}} the Ottoman front line on the coast early on the morning of 19 September, the Australian Mounted Division's 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades (less the 5th Light Horse Brigade temporarily detached to the 60th Division) in reserve, followed the 4th Cavalry Division north <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plain</b> of Sharon and across the Mount Carmel Range, by the Musmus Pass, to Lejjun on the Esdrealon Plain. While the 4th Light Horse Brigade remained to garrison Lejjun and provide various guards for artillery, supplies, and corps headquarters before being ordered to capture Samakh, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade advanced to Jenin, where the 9th and 10th Light Horse captured the town after a brief fire fight. Subsequently, these two regiments captured some 8,000 Ottoman soldiers, who had been attempting to retreat northwards out of the Judean Hills, during the night of 20/21 September. The outnumbered Australian Light Horsemen were reinforced as quickly as possible, and the majority of the prisoners were marched back into holding camps, near Lejjun in the morning. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade remained in the area to garrison Jenin until they advanced to capture Tiberias on 25 September 1918, before participating in the pursuit to Damascus.|$|E
