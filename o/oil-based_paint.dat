5000|$|There are {{two common}} types of paint used today. The first are {{water-based}} paints such as latex and acrylic paint, {{and the second}} are <b>oil-based</b> <b>paints.</b> The paint of choice {{will depend on the}} substrate to be painted upon and the desired end result. All paints have the same basic structure: ...|$|R
50|$|Synthetic {{filaments}} {{last longer}} than natural bristles. Natural bristles are preferred for <b>oil-based</b> <b>paints</b> and varnishes, while synthetic brushes are better for water-based paints as the bristles do not expand when wetted.|$|R
50|$|Neatsfoot oil {{is often}} used to oil sign-writers' brushes that have been used in <b>oil-based</b> <b>paint,</b> as this oil is non drying and can be easily washed out with solvent at any time. Oiling the brushes reduces the buildup of pigment in the ferrule, the metal part that many brushes have to hold the hairs in place.|$|E
50|$|Before using {{paint on}} trees, it is {{sometimes}} necessary to clean the surface. One of the preferred techniques in the USA {{is to use a}} knife or drawknife to smooth the outer bark of trees without penetrating to the inner bark (so as to not injure the tree), then using an <b>oil-based</b> <b>paint</b> to create the blaze. Since paint introduces small amounts of potentially toxic chemicals into a protected environment, it is often preferred to keep the blazes small. Stencils are often useful, and sash brushes are the preferred brush type for precise work. <b>Oil-based</b> <b>paint</b> seems to last longer than latex-based and seems to be more benign to the bark. Blazes may also be painted on obvious rock surfaces or on posts set into the ground (or on utility poles, fences, or other handy surfaces) where the trail follows a road or goes through fields and meadows.|$|E
50|$|The oil print {{process is}} a {{photographic}} printmaking process {{that dates back to}} the mid 19th century. Oil prints are made on paper on which a thick gelatin layer has been sensitized to light using dichromate salts. After the paper is exposed to light through a negative, the gelatin emulsion is treated {{in such a way that}} highly exposed areas take up an <b>oil-based</b> <b>paint,</b> forming the photographic image.|$|E
50|$|Silicone {{sealants}} form a durable, water-tight seal, but are {{not typically}} paintable. Some silicone sealants are made to be paintable with certain types of paint such as water or <b>oil-based</b> <b>paints.</b> Other sealants are paintable.|$|R
50|$|Lestoil is a {{registered}} trade name of Clorox for a heavy-duty multi-purpose cleanser product, used to remove extremely difficult laundry stains, dissolve water-based and <b>oil-based</b> <b>paints,</b> and clean grease, oil, paint, and adhesives from floors and surfaces.|$|R
50|$|TSP {{is still}} in common use for the cleaning, {{degreasing}} and deglossing of walls prior to painting. TSP breaks the gloss of <b>oil-based</b> <b>paints</b> and opens the pores of latex-based paint providing a surface better suited for the adhesion of the subsequent layer.|$|R
50|$|Profile Portrait of a Young Lady is a 1465 half-length portrait, {{commonly}} {{attributed to}} Italian artist Antonio del Pollaiuolo and <b>oil-based</b> <b>paint</b> on a poplar panel. A minority of scholars attribute the portrait to another Italian artist, Piero della Francesca. Wilhelm von Bode attributed {{the painting to}} Domenico Veneziano, while others think of Alessio Baldovinetti. The emphatic use of line and {{the clarity of the}} contrasting colour surfaces are typical features of the Florentine School.|$|E
50|$|The Mean Streak {{is a type}} of marker made by Sanford, but {{can also}} refer to a variety of {{solidified}} paint marking sticks. This marker is a semi-solidified stick of <b>oil-based</b> <b>paint</b> in a twist tube which makes marks on many types of surfaces, including metal, wood, plastics, and paper, making it a popular graffiti instrument. It leaves a mark similar to a crayon or chalk. They {{come in a variety of}} colors; the original colors were blue, red and yellow.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{with most}} {{permanent}} markers the ink is an <b>oil-based</b> <b>paint</b> and generally requires shaking before use, similar to an aerosol spray paint can. In addition, {{the line is}} very opaque and, unlike spirit-based or other permanent inks, will not fade with exposure to UV light, and overlays all other colors beneath it. The paint from these types of markers is not truly permanent, {{as it can be}} removed using high pressure cleaning or paint thinning solvents such as acetone.|$|E
5000|$|A {{paint thinner}} is a solvent used to thin <b>oil-based</b> <b>paints</b> or {{clean up after}} their use. Commercially, {{solvents}} labeled [...] "Paint Thinner" [...] are usually mineral spirits having a flash point at about 40 °C (104 °F), the same as some popular brands of charcoal starter.|$|R
50|$|Solvent-borne, {{also called}} <b>oil-based,</b> <b>paints</b> can have various {{combinations}} of organic solvents as the diluent, including aliphatics, aromatics, alcohols, ketones and white spirit. Specific examples are organic solvents such as petroleum distillate, esters, glycol ethers, and the like. Sometimes volatile low-molecular weight synthetic resins {{also serve as}} diluents.|$|R
50|$|Solvent - this is {{the bulk}} of the paint, it is used to keep the paint {{workable}} when it is wet. After paint is applied to a surface the solvent evaporates, the pigment and binder will coalesce together to form a uniform coating. The solvent is water for water-based paints, and an oil for <b>oil-based</b> <b>paints.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Typically {{the term}} [...] "enamel paint" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} oil-based covering products, usually with {{a significant amount of}} gloss in them, however recently many latex or water-based paints have adopted the term as well. The term today means [...] "hard surfaced paint" [...] and usually is in reference to paint brands of higher quality, floor coatings of a high gloss finish, or spray paints. Most enamel paints are alkyd resin based. Some enamel paints have been made by adding varnish to <b>oil-based</b> <b>paint.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} making a wax figure can take {{anywhere}} from four to six months. After a survey has been conducted on who the attraction should include, researchers find out {{as much information as}} possible about the chosen celebrities including their hairstyle, common facial expressions, and clothing preferences. If they are able, celebrities visit the Madame Tussauds stylists who take more than 150 measurements and 200 photos, and use an <b>oil-based</b> <b>paint</b> to create a realistic skin complexion. The figure is not made entirely of wax, but also uses clay and steel.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, a {{new layer}} of <b>oil-based</b> <b>paint</b> {{is applied to}} most parts of a {{painting}} only after allowing a previous layer to dry completely; this drying process can take from several days to several weeks, depending on {{the thickness of the}} paint. In contrast, work performed using [...] "alla prima" [...] can be carried out in one or more sessions (depending on the types of paint used and their respective drying times), and it is common for such a work to be finished in only one session or [...] "sitting".|$|E
5000|$|An oil drying agent, {{also known}} as siccative, is a {{coordination}} compound that accelerates (catalyzes) the hardening of drying oils, often as they are used in <b>oil-based</b> <b>paints.</b> This so-called [...] "drying" [...] (actually a chemical reaction that produces an organic plastic) occurs through free-radical chemical crosslinking of the oils. The catalysts promote this free-radical autoxidation of the oils with air.|$|R
50|$|White's {{enthusiasm for}} {{watercolor}} was unusual - most contemporary painters preferred to use <b>oil-based</b> <b>paints.</b> White's watercolors would soon become a sensation in Europe; {{it was not}} long before the watercolors were engraved by the Flemish master engraver Theodore de Bry. Through the medium of print, the illustrations became widely known and distributed; they were published in 1590 under the title America.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} 18 she {{attended}} the Traphagen School Of Design in New York City for a year. She began work painting clothing and baby cribs in the 1950s until she finally began a career painting portraits. Early on, Margaret began experimenting in Kitsch. She worked in both acrylic- and <b>oil-based</b> <b>paints,</b> but her work was limited to women, children and familiar animals (cats, dogs, horses).|$|R
50|$|Mineral {{spirits are}} an {{inexpensive}} petroleum-based {{replacement for the}} vegetable-based turpentine. It is commonly used as a paint thinner for <b>oil-based</b> <b>paint</b> and cleaning brushes, and as an organic solvent in other applications. Mineral turpentine is chemically very different from turpentine, which mainly consists of pinene, and it has inferior solvent properties. Artists use mineral spirits {{as an alternative to}} turpentine since it is less flammable and less toxic. Because of interactions with pigments in oil paints, artists require a higher grade of mineral spirits than many industrial users, including the complete absence of residual sulfur.|$|E
5000|$|Water {{miscible}} {{oil paints}} (also called [...] "water soluble" [...] or [...] "water-mixable") {{is a modern}} variety of oil paint engineered to be thinned and cleaned up with water, {{rather than having to}} use chemicals such as turpentine. It can be mixed and applied using the same techniques as traditional <b>oil-based</b> <b>paint,</b> but while still wet it can be effectively removed from brushes, palettes, and rags with ordinary soap and water. Its water solubility comes from the use of an oil medium in which one end of the molecule has been altered to bind loosely to water molecules, as in a solution.|$|E
50|$|An oil {{painting}} consists of several layers, comprising the base canvas, {{a layer of}} gesso base coat, several layers of the <b>oil-based</b> <b>paint</b> and then several coats of varnish to protect the paint surface. With many different materials, {{it is understandable that}} each layer may dry at different rates and will also absorb and release moisture at different rates. When this occurs, expansion and contraction of the painting will result in a crazing of the varnish surface. This pattern of small cracks is known as craquelure. Along with the darkening or yellowing of the varnish surface, it is this visual representation of the cracking that is typically the primary indicator of ageing.|$|E
5000|$|In fire classes, a Class B fire is {{a fire in}} {{flammable}} liquids or flammable gases, petroleum greases, tars, oils, <b>oil-based</b> <b>paints,</b> solvents, lacquers, or alcohols. For example, propane, natural gas, gasoline and kerosene fires are types of Class B fires. [...] The use of lighter fluid on a charcoal grill, for example, creates a Class B fire. Some plastics are also Class B fire materials.|$|R

50|$|Metro began {{collecting}} and recycling post-consumer latex paint (PCLP) {{from the public}} in 1991 {{as part of its}} household hazardous waste program. While not considered a hazardous waste, latex paint was received by regional garbage customers along with hazardous wastes such as <b>oil-based</b> <b>paints,</b> pesticides, solvents, and cleaners. In an effort to handle the latex paint in a cost-effective, environmentally-responsible manner, Metro decided to recycle the reusable latex paint and return it to the public.|$|R
