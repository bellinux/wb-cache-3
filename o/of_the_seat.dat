5|$|The new Parliament met in 1904 {{and reached}} a compromise, {{choosing}} Dalgety, which, like Bombala, {{was located in}} the Monaro region. Thus, with the passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seat</b> of Government Act 1904, {{it appeared that the}} matter had been settled. However, while the Federal Parliament supported Dalgety, the New South Wales government did not, and they proved unwilling to cede the amount of territory the Federal Government demanded.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Paul was speculated {{to run for}} {{president}} in 1992 but opted instead to work on the campaign for Pat Buchanan. That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned to the Republican Party and was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without much support from establishment Republicans, who supported the party-switching Democratic incumbent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a free market and advocating a reduction {{in the size of the}} federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. Bush in the 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran {{for president}} again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of grassroots support.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the late}} eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Cumaná {{experienced}} an increase in population. The areas around the castles and the Manzanares River became densely populated. New buildings were constructed that were attached to the castle walls, completely closing off the perimeter and making direct access impossible. Another earthquake in 1929 left the structure in ruins and rendered it unusable. The offices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of government for the Province of Cumaná were moved elsewhere and the building was abandoned. The castle was declared a Cultural and Municipal Asset in May 2005 by the state Cultural Assets Institute.|$|E
5|$|During the Nanboku-chō period {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Kamakura shogunate in 1333, Nanbu Motoyuki accompanied Kitabatake Akiie north when he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the North, and Shugo of Mutsu Province. Nanbu Motoyuki established Ne Castle, which was intended to be a center for the imperial government administration in the area. This marked the official transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of the Nanbu clan from Kai Province to Mutsu. Nanbu Motoyuki was under allegiance to the Southern Court; however, at the same time, another branch of the same Nanbu family ruled the nearby Sannohe and Morioka areas under allegiance to the rival Northern Court. The two branches of the clan made peace with each other in 1393.|$|E
5|$|In 1987 Rambhadradas {{established}} a religious {{and social service}} institution called Tulsi Peeth (The seat of Tulsi) in Chitrakoot, where, according to the Ramayana, Rama had spent twelve out of his fourteen years of exile. As the founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> the title of Śrīcitrakūṭatulasīpīṭhādhīśvara (literally, the Lord of the Tulsi Peeth at Chitrakoot) was bestowed upon him by Sadhus and intellectuals. In the Tulsi Peeth, he arranged for a temple devoted to Rama and his consort Sita to be constructed, which is known as Kanch Mandir ("glass temple").|$|E

5|$|Neither the {{clockwork}} {{visible to}} {{the left side of the}} machine nor the drawer that housed the chess set extended fully to the rear of the cabinet; they instead went only one third of the way. A sliding seat was also installed, allowing the director inside to slide from place to place and thus evade observation as the presenter opened various doors. The sliding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> caused dummy machinery to slide into its place to further conceal the person inside the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Peterborough is a borough {{constituency}} {{represented in}} the House of Commons of the UK Parliament. Its current form is the direct, unbroken successor of a smaller constituency that {{was created in the}} mid-16th century as such used for the legislatures of England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom (UK). Today's version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> elects one Member of Parliament by the first past the post system of election since 1885, before which its earlier form had two-member representation using the similar bloc vote system and both forms had a broadening but restricted franchise until 1918.|$|E
5|$|Some top riders receive special frames to {{give more}} {{stability}} and comfort. Different materials make the ride more comfortable. Tom Boonen, using a Time frame with longer wheelbase for the first time, won the race in 2005 and has since continued to use a bike with a longer wheelbase. George Hincapie had a frame featuring a 2mm elastomer insert at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> stays. The manufacturers claimed this took nearly all the shock out of the cobbles. Hincapie's Trek bicycle fared less well in 2006: his aluminum steerer tube snapped with 46km to go, the crash injuring his shoulder.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally Luffa is held to {{have begun}} the {{building}} of Chichester Cathedral, the eastern section of which was dedicated in 1108. However, this view has been challenged by the art historian R. D. H. Gem, who argues {{that because of the}} conservative nature of the architecture it was more probably begun under Luffa's predecessor, Stigand, who was bishop from 1070 to 1087, and who oversaw the transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of the bishopric from Selsey to Chichester. Most historians still incline to the belief that Luffa began the cathedral construction, however.|$|E
5|$|France even {{linked the}} issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> {{to the ongoing}} dispute {{regarding}} {{the seat of the}} European Parliament. Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg has a banking tradition that wasn't so careful. London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone. It was also seen as important to locate the bank in a city not already hosting a national government or EU institution, in order to emphasise its independence. Others, such as {{the former head of the}} Bundesbank Karl Otto Pöhl, favoured a small country with a stable currency. The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists. While there was seen by some as little to gain in terms of attracting other banks and financial institutions, others saw it as affecting which cities would be financial hubs in the years to come.|$|E
5|$|Superman the Ride has {{undergone}} numerous safety upgrades. After the 2001 incident, the PVC airlines were replaced with steel reinforced air hoses {{to prevent a}} similar accident from occurring. After the 2004 incident, metal bars were installed {{on both sides of}} the “T-bar” restraint, encasing the rider's legs. Shin restraints were added to the lower portion of the restraint, preventing riders’ feet from leaving the car. In addition, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> belts on both 36-passenger trains were replaced with ones at a consistent length, as well as a “go or no go” belt for each seat and “T-bar” restraint. The “go or no go” belt ensured the “T-bar” restraint was in an effective position before leaving the station. During the 2009 rebranding, new trains were deployed with new restraints added. The new lapbars eliminated the center pole, leaving only the exterior poles. New seat belts provided more strength and were less likely to come undone unintentionally.|$|E

40|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} that first-past-the-post in single-member constituencies is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most disproportional <b>of</b> electoral systems. <b>The</b> {{reasons for this}} are well understood. Much less discussed and understood, however, {{is the degree to}} which that system treats political parties differentially, creating bias. Such bias is well-illustrated by recent UK general elections. In 1979, the Conservative party won 43. 9 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> votes cast and 53. 4 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats.</b> Four years later, it won 42. 4 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> votes but 61. 1 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats.</b> In 1987, its shares <b>of</b> <b>the</b> votes and <b>seats</b> were 43. 4 and 57. 8 per cent respectively, and then in 1992 its vote share fell slightly, to 42. 3 per cent, but its share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> fell more sharply – to 51. 6 per cent. Labour won in 1997, with 43. 3 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> votes and 63. 6 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats.</b> Thus over five elections, whereas the leading party’s share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> votes only ranged between 42. 3 and 43. 9 per cent its share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> varied more, from 51. 6 to 63. 6 per cent.
