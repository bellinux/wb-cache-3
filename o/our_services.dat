40|$|AbstractThe formal aspects {{underlying}} a novel distributed {{backup service}} are discussed. Strength and originality {{of the service}} lie in the combined adoption of an established information dispersal algorithm with a simplified version of an existing location service. Information dispersal makes <b>our</b> <b>service</b> threshold-secure in that the backup owner only needs participation of a pre-established threshold number of nodes to recompose a distributed backup. This means that the service is highly available as it tolerates a number of node breakdowns. Even the right threshold number of nodes cannot retrieve the backup on their own initiative. The location <b>service</b> adopted allows <b>our</b> <b>service</b> to work over non-organized, flat networks. Indirect advantages are the optimization of the total redundancy of data and the efficient management of resources. <b>Our</b> <b>service</b> has reached the stage of a proof-of-concept implementation...|$|R
