Four representatives of the company were interviewed via Skype calls and telephone call, the information obtained was recorded by taking hand-written notes. Three research objectives were addressed on the base of the collected data. The results of the research indicated that the company successfully coordinated and integrated information, material and financial flows within its boundaries. Despite, the company failed to externally integrate with suppliers and customers. Key words: Supply chain integration, internal integration, supplier integration, customer integratio...|$|R

Many organisations use traditional approaches like the Waterfall model to develop software products for different customers.

The framework comprises four elements: the animator element which distinguishes the rationale that defines the system and its motive; the process element; the temporal element; and the material element which demarcates physical constraints and the way affordances of the lived world are taken up. There are two dimensions: distinction, the extent to which boundaries demarcate; and threshold, the degree to which boundaries regulate movement and asymmetries in that regulation.

40|$|The {{decline of}} {{collective}} bargaining and the blurring of <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries</b> between firms have adversely affected employment {{standards in the}} British labour market. In this context, this paper considers the potential for using socially sustainable sourcing to strengthen collective labour market protections for low-wage workers, particularly in situations where work and production is organised across <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries.</b> It examines the different ways that firms, unions, civil society organisations and governments have used sustainable sourcing mechanisms to counter the negative impacts of outsourcing and supply chain pressures on labour standards. At a domestic level, compulsory forms of sustainable sourcing {{appear to be a}} more effective than voluntary forms for protecting labour standards, but the prospect of a compulsory model being adopted in Britain seems unlikely. Socially sustainable sourcing mechanisms are nevertheless likely to become increasingly important for protecting labour standards across <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries.</b> 20 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Requirements {{engineering}} plays a {{vital role}} in the software development process. While it is difficult to manage those requirements locally, it is even more difficult to communicate those requirements over <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries</b> and to convey them to multiple distribution customers. This paper discusses the requirements of multiple distribution customers empirically in the context of customised software products. The main purpose is to understand the challenges of communicating and allocating customisation requirements across distributed <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries.</b> We conducted an empirical survey with 19 practitioners, which confirmed that communicating customisation requirements in a DSD context is a significant challenge. We therefore propose a model for allocating customisation requirements between a local, customer-based agile team and a distributed development team that uses a traditional development approach. Our conjecture is that the model would reduce the challenge of communicating requirements across <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries,</b> address customers’ requirements and provide a focus for future empirical studies...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{leadership}} and engagement across <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries</b> {{has been gaining}} significant attention {{over the last few}} years. Within the NHS, there has been an increased focus within policy directives and the literature on partnership working, collaborations, cross-organisation and cross-profession working. These innovative ways of working are a means of improving the quality and co-ordination of patient care across the pathway, thus influencing the patients’ experience. Despite this focus, the evidence of what constitutes and therefore what can deliver effective inter-organisational clinical {{leadership and}} engagement within this context is sparse. This paper identifies the characteristics and impact of effective clinical leadership, clinical engagement and team effectiveness when working across <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries.</b> The paper demonstrates that there are significant improvements in the delivery of healthcare and patient experience when clinicians work effectively across the whole of the patient pathway, spanning <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Guidelines on critical areas for future development and sustainability is expounded upon as an outcome of this study...|$|R
40|$|Organisational {{structure}} {{is synonymous with}} a firm’s knowledge – both today and in respect of a firm’s future knowledge stocks. For some, this may seem obvious, yet for most scholars (and practitioners) {{this is not the}} case, as structure – particularly where the boundaries of the firm lie and what they look like – rarely makes it into any knowledge management discussion. Yet what a firm does today, be it broad in its activities or highly focussed {{to the point of being}} a virtual organisation, is both a reflection of its existing capabilities/routines (which are based around knowledge) as well as determining its likely learning and transformational opportunities into the future. In addition, the permeability of any <b>organisational</b> <b>boundary</b> and the existence of any mechanism to maximise the inflows of new knowledge are fundamental to developing new or reconfiguring existing capabilities. This paper therefore addresses how knowledge and structure and inextricably linked and through the use of a case study illustrates how a public sector organisation has significantly rebuilt its capabilities by rethinking its <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries,</b> both in terms of location and basic characteristics. The determination of <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries</b> is a classic theme with theories being developed on the basis of tasks and activities (Katz & Kahn 1966; Lawrence & Lorsch 1967; Thompson 1967), to theories of economic organisation focused on property rights and transaction costs (Alchian & Demsetz 1972; Grossman & Hart 1986; Jensen & Meckling 1976; Williamson 1975), and strategic theories of resources, capabilities and knowledge (Barney 1995; Foss 2002; McGee 2003; Teece, Pisano & Shuen 1997). While these different theories each provide a different lens with which to understand how organisations structure themselves to create their boundaries, these theories tend to be weak in linking <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries</b> to value creation (or competitive advantage). Furthermore, these theories say little about the nature of <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries</b> beyond their basic location. To counter this perceived weakness, we draw primarily upon the knowledge based view of the firm which proffers an alternative explanation regarding <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries</b> and the need for organisational alliances. The knowledge literature simultaneously provides an opportunity to investigate the nature of <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries</b> in the context of alliances and knowledge transfer. Positing that organisational structure in terms of firm boundaries (location and permeability) fundamentally drive an organisation’s ability to engage in learning and knowledge transfer, we use a case study of Main Roads Western Australia (WA) to illustrate how rethinking their structural boundaries and the nature of these boundaries allowed for a rebuilding of key organisational capabilities...|$|R
40|$|<b>Organisational</b> <b>boundaries</b> can be {{analysed}} via {{a variety}} of lenses – organisational design principles, transaction cost economics, property rights and agency theory, amongst others. We review these before taking a knowledge-based perspective to firstly explain how {{the boundaries of the}} firm are determined by the knowledge resources present, and second, to highlight how conceptualising the drivers of competitive advantage in terms of knowledge and learning create a backdrop for understanding the move towards intermediate or hybrid organisational forms most commonly characterised by strategic alliances. We subsequently propose that the exact location of these naturally more fluid boundaries of the firm that exist in conjunction with strategic alliances are not as important as the level of permeability of the <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Permeable <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries</b> allow for more efficient use of key knowledge resources; for firms to make and buy the same activity simultaneously and for learning to occur – a key driver of competitive advantage for those that subscribe to the knowledge-based view or the dynamic capabilities view of competitive advantage...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: In this paper, {{integrated}} care in an inter-organisational cooperative {{setting of}} in-home elderly care is studied. The {{aim is to}} explore how home care workers coordinate their daily work, identify coordination issues in situ and discuss possible actions for supporting seamless and integrated elderly care at home. Method: The empirical findings are drawn from an ethnographic workplace study of the cooperation and coordination taking place between home care workers in a Swedish county. Data were collected through observational studies, interviews and group discussions. Findings: The paper identifies a need to support two core issues. Firstly, it must be made clear how the care interventions that are currently defined as ‘self-treatment’ by the home health care should be divided. Secondly, the distributed and asynchronous coordination between all care workers involved, regardless of organisational belonging must be better supported. Conclusion: Integrated care needs to be developed between organisations as well as within each organisation. As a matter of fact, integrated care needs to be built up beyond <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries.</b> <b>Organisational</b> <b>boundaries</b> affect the planning {{of the division of}} care interventions, but not the coordination during the home care process. During the home care process, the main challenge is the coordination difficulties that arise from the fact that workers are distributed in time and/or space, regardless of organisational belonging.

40|$|Society is {{challenging}} systems engineers by demanding increasingly complex and integrated IT systems (Northrop et al., 2006; RAE, 2004) e. g. integrated {{enterprise resource planning}} systems, integrated healthcare systems and business critical services provisioned using cloud based resources. These types of IT system are often systems-of-systems (SoS). That is {{to say they are}} composed of multiple systems that are operated and managed by independent parties and are distributed across multiple <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries,</b> geographies or legal jurisdictions (Maier, 1998). SoS are notorious for becoming problematic due to interconnected technical and social issues. Practitioners claim that they are ill equipped to deal with the sociotechnical challenges posed by system-of-systems. One of these challenges is to identify the socio-technical threats associated with building, operating and managing systems whose parts are distributed across <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Another is how to troubleshoot these systems when they exhibit undesirable behaviour. This thesis aims to provide a modelling abstraction and an extensible technique that enables practitioners to identify socio-technical threats prior to implementation and troubleshoot SoS post-implementation. This thesis evaluates existing modelling abstractions for their suitability to represent SoS and suggests that an agent-responsibility based modelling abstraction may provide a practical and scalable way of representing SoS for socio-technical threat identification and troubleshooting. The practicality and scalability of the abstraction is explored through the use of case studies that motivate the extension of existing responsibility-based techniques so that new classes of system (coalitions-of-systems) and new classes of threat (agent-related threats) may be analysed. This thesis concludes that the notion of ‘responsibility’ is a promising abstraction for representing and analysing systems that are composed of parts that are independently managed and maintained by agents spanning multiple <b>organisational</b> <b>boundaries</b> e. g. systems-of-systems, enterprise-scale systems...|$|R
