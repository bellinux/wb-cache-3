25|$|Nero Wolfe is {{a fictional}} character, a brilliant, oversize, {{eccentric}} armchair detective created in 1934 by American mystery writer Rex Stout. Wolfe {{was born in}} Montenegro and keeps his past murky. He lives in a luxurious brownstone on West 35th Street in New York City, and he is loath to leave his home for business <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> would keep him from reading his books, tending his orchids, or eating the gourmet meals prepared by his chef, Fritz Brenner. Archie Goodwin, Wolfe's sharp-witted, dapper young confidential assistant with an eye for attractive women, narrates the cases and does the legwork for the detective genius.|$|E

At such moments people experience the common everyday trance; they tend to gaze {{off to the right}} or left, depending upon which cerebral hemisphere is most dominant (Baleen, 1969) and get that faraway or blank look. Their eyes may actually close, their bodies tend to become immobile (a form of catalepsy), certain reflexes (e.g., swallowing, respiration, etc.) may be suppressed, and they seem momentarily oblivious to their surroundings until they have completed their inner search on the unconscious level for the new idea, response, or frames of reference that will restabilize their general reality orientation. We hypothesize that in everyday life consciousness is in a continual state of flux between the general reality orientation and the momentary microdynamics of trance...|$|E
25|$|However, many monastic orders, {{particularly}} the Benedictines, were {{very involved in}} healing and caring for the sick and dying. In many cases, the Greek philosophy that early Medieval medicine was based upon was compatible with Christianity. Though the widespread Christian tradition of sickness being a divine intervention in reaction to sin was popularly believed throughout the Middle Ages, it did not rule out natural causes. For example, the Black Death was {{thought to have been}} caused by both divine and natural origins. The plague was thought to have been a punishment from God for sinning, however because it was believed that God was the reason for all natural phenomena, the physical cause of the plague could be scientifically explained as well. One of the more widely accepted scientific explanations of the plague was the corruption of air in which pollutants such as rotting matter <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> gave the air an unpleasant scent caused the spread of the plague.|$|E

500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the series, Crash's sole offensive maneuvers were jumping onto his enemies and a distinctive technique in which he spins around like a tornado, kicking away anyone <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> he strikes. In later games Crash can expand his range of abilities by defeating boss characters. The expanded abilities include a powerful splash, the ability to jump while in the air, the [...] "Death Tornado Spin" [...] (a variation of his spinning technique that allows him to hover through the air for a limited time), a bazooka that fires Wumpa Fruit, increased running speed, the ability to safely tip-toe on top of explosive crates, and the ability to jump at incredibly high heights. The games Crash of the Titans and [...] allow Crash to further expand his offensive abilities with new fighting moves learned from collecting a magical substance known as [...] "Mojo". In , Crash has the ability to throw TNT crates, and can use his Yo-yo to bring in enemies to spin attack.|$|E

[...] On their relationship he added, [...] "except for the final act, when they finally succumb to their lust for one another ...

Especially Shannon, whose high point of usefulness was deciphering Rousseau's documents for Sayid. Well, Maggie Grace is given an opportunity to shine and she does an acceptable job as the distraught sibling who is now looking for someone to blame for Boone's death. We finally get to see some real depth to Shannon's character and her quest for vengeance is believable."

She never left him till he was dead, but continued kissing him the very moment his breath {{went out of his}} body, and 'twas {{with a great deal of}} difficulty my Lady Marlborough prevailed upon her to leave him."
