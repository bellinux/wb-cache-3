40|$|Background and Design: The aims of {{our study}} were to {{determine}} the frequency of positive patch reactions and the most common allergens in patients with allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and/or mucositis(M) who underwent with T. R. U. E. “Thin-layer Rapid-Use Epicutaneous” test and evaluate supplemantal series used with T. R. U. E. test effect on patch test results. Material and Method: In this study 161 ACD, 5 ACM, 1 ACD and ACM were enrolled. While 139 of all patients were patch tested with T. R. U. E. test alone,out of 28 patients were tested for T. R. U. E. test and also with supplemental series that included textile colours (9 of tested patients), plastic and glues (9), dental screening (6), backery (2), cosmetic (1) and plastic and glues and dental screening (1). Supplemental series were chosen according to patient’s occupation and clinic presentation. The data from our patients were analyzed as percentage. The relationship between contact sensitization and atopic status was evaluated with Yate’s correlation x 2 test. Results: Eighty-six male, 81 female were taken into this study. The median age was 36. 5. While 25. 9 % of 139 patients tested with T. R. U. E. test alone, 46. 4 % of 28 patients applied supplemental series in addition to T. R. U. E. test showed positive reaction {{to one or more}} allergens. The most common allergens were nickel sulphate (14. 4 %), potassium dichromate (4. 8 %), fragrance mix (2. 9 %) and colophony (2. 9 %). The most common supplemental allergens were <b>octil</b> gallat (50 %) in bakery and copper sulphate, goldsodiumthiosulphate (42. 8 %) in dental screening. Positive patch reactions were detected 83. 3 % in 6 patients with AKM, 80 % of these positive reactions was againts dental screening. The rate of contact sensitization between atopics and non-atopics was not significant (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: We suggest in presence of mucositis and/or occupational dermatoses using supplemental series in addition to T. R. U. E. test would be more beneficial in identifing the responsible allergen. (Turkderm 2008; 42 : 13 - 7...|$|E
