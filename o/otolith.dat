5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an <b>otolith</b> is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced <b>otolith</b> rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result {{in the perception of}} vertigo.|$|E
5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the <b>otolith</b> organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
25|$|In weightlessness, astronauts {{must rely}} {{much more on}} vision to {{maintain}} their spatial orientation, because the <b>otolith</b> organs can no longer signal the “down” direction. During prolonged exposure, however, reliance seems to shift toward an intrinsic, body vertical reference. The erroneous illusions of self-motion during head movements performed during and after return to Earth gravity are presumably due to a re-interpretation of vestibular inputs. Ground-based {{studies suggest that the}} CNS resolves the “tilt-translation” ambiguity based on the frequency content of the linear acceleration detected by the <b>otolith</b> organs, with low frequency indicating “tilt” and high frequency indicating “translation”. A crossover exists at about 0.3Hz where the <b>otolith</b> signals are then ambiguous. Exposure to weightlessness presumably results in a shift of this crossover frequency, which could then contribute to spatial disorientation and SMS.|$|E
40|$|Previous ageing studies {{compared}} {{the precision of}} yellow perch (Perca flavescens) scales to <b>otoliths</b> and scales to opercles and in each study, scales were proven to be less precise. To date, a comparative study between yellow perch <b>otoliths</b> and opercles has not been undertaken. Therefore, the goal of our study was to compare ageing precision of opercles to <b>otoliths,</b> while establishing the best methodology to use for ageing <b>otoliths.</b> Opercles and <b>otoliths</b> were collected from 217 yellow perch {{in the summer of}} 2003 from three sites located in southern Lake Michigan. Opercles were read as whole structures, while <b>otoliths</b> were read whole, sectioned, and break and burn. All four methodologies were aged three times by three independent readers. Opercles, sectioned <b>otoliths,</b> and break and burn <b>otoliths</b> were found to be the most precise structures for aging. Further investigation into the ageing of yellow perch improves the efficiency and precision of the ageing process. As a result, better fisheries management practices can be utilized.

40|$|Summary: Sagittal <b>otoliths,</b> dorsal spines and {{scales were}} {{critically}} assessed as structures to potentially determine {{the age of}} the long-finned gurnard, Lepidotrigla argus. Counts were made of opaque growth increments and a readability score was assigned to each structure. Comparisons of growth increment counts were made between structures and between readings. All three structures showed some degree of readability and quantifiable growth increments, but this varied within fishes and between structures. Initial results showed that whole <b>otoliths</b> were more suitable to determine age estimates than dorsal spines and scales. Scales were considered unsuitable due to between reading ageing bias, variation in age estimates between structures, low precision and poor readability for this species. Dorsal spines showed evidence of loss of growth increments due to hollowing of the vascular core, which resulted in underestimation of older individuals in comparison to whole <b>otoliths.</b> Further analysis showed that growth increment counts from whole <b>otoliths</b> were lower for older individuals in comparison to sectioned <b>otoliths.</b> It is suggested that this is because of decreased clarity of growth increments towards the outer margin of whole <b>otoliths</b> in older individuals; this problem was not present with sectioned <b>otoliths.</b> It was concluded that sectioned <b>otoliths</b> were a more suitable structure from which to estimate age of L. argus than were whole <b>otoliths,</b> dorsal spines and/or scales...|$|R
40|$|The <b>otoliths</b> of {{sea bass}} (Lates calcarifer) were sampled from 23 {{locations}} in Peninsular Malaysia {{in order to}} analyse the Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios. This study found that these elements/Ca ratios in sea bass <b>otoliths</b> were correlated with the salinity zone (thalassic series) compared with elements/Ca ratios in ambient water. The contradictory pattern of Sr/Ca ratios and Ba/Ca ratios in <b>otoliths</b> was found according to salinity zone variations. Thus, oligohaline waters showed the highest Ba/Ca ratios while the highest Sr/Ca ratios were recorded for saline waters. The terrigenous enrichment of Ba in water also affects the Ba content in <b>otoliths.</b> The presence of Mg in <b>otoliths</b> acts as a rival to Ba, thus affecting Mg and Ba deposition. Meanwhile, Ba is the tracer for salinity fluctuations based on the partition coefficient (D) and it shows significant changes. However, the elements in <b>otoliths</b> were found to originate indirectly from the water column. The sequence of the elements/Ca ratios in <b>otoliths</b> and ambient water was Sr/Ca>Mg/Ca>Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca>Ba/Ca>Mg/Ca, respectively...|$|R
25|$|Otoliths {{cannot be}} used alone to {{reliably}} estimate cetacean or pinniped diets, however. They may suffer partial or complete erosion in the digestive tract, skewing measurements of prey number and biomass. Species with fragile, easily digested otoliths may be underestimated in the diet. To address these biases, <b>otolith</b> correction factors have been developed through captive feeding experiments, in which seals are fed fish of known size, {{and the degree of}} <b>otolith</b> erosion is quantified for different prey taxa.|$|E

40|$|<b>Otoliths</b> {{of modern}} bony fishes are massive {{polycrystalline}} structuresconsisting mainly of calcium carbonate (primarily aragonite), and 1 - 10 %organic residuals.

We examined internal structuralvariation of <b>otoliths</b> through microstructural and texture analyses. Ourstudy applied the electron backscattered diffraction technique (EBSD) towhole sections of saccular <b>otoliths</b> on cave- and surface-dwelling fish. Application of high spatial resolution EBSD on <b>otoliths</b> of thelivebearing fish Poecilia mexicana allowed for an investigation ofcrystal orientation despite the small size (< 150 nm) of aragonitecrystallites.

40|$|<b>Otoliths</b> are calcium {{carbonate}} structures {{located in the}} inner ear of fish; {{they are responsible for}} hearing and balance. The inner ear has three pairs of otoliths: the lapilli, the sagittae and the asterisci. The sagittae <b>otoliths</b> are the largest and their format is species-specific. Because of their composition, <b>otoliths</b> can resist to the digestive tract of ichthyophagous species, and they can be used as an important tool for identifying species of fish found in stomach contents. The purpose of this work is to provide a photographic guide of the sagittae <b>otoliths</b> of the main fish species from the Sinos River.

25|$|Each year, {{the fish}} {{experiences}} {{a period of}} rapid growth, often in summer, and one of slower growth, normally in winter. This results in ring formation around an earbone called the <b>otolith,</b> (annuli) analogous to the growth rings visible in a tree trunk. Freshwater growth shows as densely crowded rings, sea growth as widely spaced rings; spawning is marked by significant erosion as body mass is converted into eggs and milt.|$|E
25|$|Sagittal {{otoliths}} (sagittae) are bilaterally symmetrical, {{with each}} fish having one right and one left. Separating recovered otoliths into right and left, therefore, {{allows one to}} infer a minimum number of prey individuals ingested for a given fish species. <b>Otolith</b> size is also proportional to the length and weight of a fish. They can therefore be used to back-calculate prey size and biomass, useful when trying to estimate marine mammal prey consumption, and potential impacts on fish stocks.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{compounds}} in fish <b>otoliths</b> {{are resistant to}} digestion, they {{are found in the}} digestive tracts and scats of piscivorous marine mammals, such as dolphins, seals, sea lions and walruses.

25|$|During {{this early}} stage of life they {{are very similar to}} Carangoides bartholomaei, and often form {{associations}} with floating pelagic Sargassum mats which provide the young fish with protection. Young fish often inhabit the shallow reef waters, but move offshore once they reach sexual maturity.

25|$|BPPV {{can result}} from a head injury or simply occur {{among those who are}} older. A {{specific}} cause is often not found. The underlying mechanism involves a small calcified <b>otolith</b> moving around loose in the inner ear. It is a type of balance disorder along with labyrinthitis and Ménière's disease.

25|$|The {{function}} of the vestibular system during spaceflight {{is by far the}} most carefully studied of all. This is especially true of the gravity-sensing <b>otolith</b> organs and their relationship to eye movements. The vestibular semicircular canal function seems unchanged in weightlessness because the horizontal eye movements that compensated for head yaw rotation are not affected by spaceflight. The absence of gravity stimulation of the otoliths reduces the torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex during head roll rotation in microgravity. This deficit is absent when astronauts are exposed to centrifugal forces, suggesting that the adaptive CNS changes are taking place centrally rather than peripherally.|$|E

40|$|Age {{composition}} {{is fundamental to}} understanding the population dynamics and productivity of a fish stock. The use of scales to estimate age can result in large errors in age data for long-lived species, usually due to compression of scale circuli with age.

For scales, we made impressions on acetate slides; for <b>otoliths,</b> we used transverse sections prepared by baking and grinding the posterior and anterior sides. Using ANOVA, we compared data obtained from the two structures to test the hypothesis that <b>otoliths</b> and scales give the salvie age estimates, and compared the precisioli of age estimation for both structures and between readers. Ages estimated using scales were significantly less than those estimated using <b>otoliths.</b> For scales, bias occurred for both readers between readings; for <b>otoliths,</b> only one reader was biased. Residual variances indicated one reader was relatively more precise than the other in estimating age using <b>otoliths,</b> but less precise using scales. This reflected the comparative experience of the two readers in estimating the age of D. eleginoides using <b>otoliths</b> and scales...|$|R

One of the goals in that project was to develop a reference collection for each species. These collections would be used as a guide for new age readers, but also for checking the precision of the routine age reading. Bente Røttingen and Jaime Alvarez started to plan a reference collection of capelin <b>otoliths</b> in 2008, and selected <b>otoliths</b> from 1981, when the historic material contained <b>otoliths</b> from all months throughout the year. The <b>otoliths</b> were selected based on the criterion that they should be easy to interpret. Since the age reading of capelin by yearly rings in the <b>otoliths</b> never have been validated, the age given is agreed age by experienced readers.

However, the reference collection is a valuable tool for establishing a standard for how capelin <b>otoliths</b> are presently interpreted at the Institute of Marine Research...|$|R
25|$|Endolymphatic infillings such as {{otoliths}} are {{structures in}} the saccule and utricle of the inner ear, specifically in the vestibular labyrinth of all vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds). In vertebrates, the saccule and utricle together make the <b>otolith</b> organs. Both statoconia and otoliths are used as gravity, balance, movement, and directional indicators in all vertebrates and have a secondary function in sound detection in higher aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates. They are sensitive to gravity and linear acceleration. Because of their orientation in the head, the utricle is sensitive {{to a change in}} horizontal movement, and the saccule gives information about vertical acceleration (such as when in an elevator).|$|E

25|$|Space {{neuroscience}} is {{the scientific}} study of the central nervous system (CNS) functions during spaceflight. Living systems can integrate the inputs from the senses to navigate in their environment and to coordinate posture, locomotion, and eye movements. Gravity has a fundamental role in controlling these functions. In weightlessness during spaceflight, integrating the sensory inputs and coordinating motor responses is harder to do because gravity is no longer sensed during free-fall. For example, the <b>otolith</b> organs of the vestibular system no longer signal head tilt relative to gravity when standing. However, they can still sense head translation during body motion. Ambiguities and changes in how the gravitational input is processed can lead to potential errors in perception, which affects spatial orientation and mental representation. Dysfunctions of the vestibular system are common during and immediately after spaceflight, such as space motion sickness in orbit and balance disorders after return to Earth.|$|E

Compared with previous SEM techniques, which normally prepare <b>otoliths</b> individually for viewing, this allowed larger sample sizes to be examined.

40|$|Geometric morphometric {{analysis}} was used to evaluate the shape of complete and broken <b>otoliths</b> in stock discrimination of Scomberomorus sierra. Data come from three different fishing locations in the mouth of the Gulf of California. Of the 70 <b>otoliths</b> pairs from location, 35 were broken. On the Complete <b>Otoliths</b> (CO) image 41 marks were located and 31 on Broken <b>Otoliths</b> (BO), the latter lacking rostrum. To evaluate the potential loss of BO resolution, the last 10 marks were eliminated from the CO and a third set of information was integrated as Virtually Broken <b>Otoliths</b> (VBO). The effect of the size, position and orientation of the spatial configurations of the <b>otoliths</b> were eliminated through the procedure of Procrustes superimposition. A canonical variable analysis detected significant differences (p< 0. 05) in the three data sets and the distribution of the scores indicated a clear separation of the three groups, suggesting a morphologic difference of the <b>otoliths</b> from the three fishing locations. Also, the pairwise differences based on the Procrustes distances were statistically significant in all cases (p< 0. 05). In agreement with Mahalanobis distances, the average percentage of correct assignation varied from 89 % in CO and VBO to 80 % in BO. It is ruled out that the morphologic differences are attributed to an allometric effect, since, in none of the cases the size of the centroid showed a significant correlation with the canonical axes.

25|$|In fact, {{the human}} body has seven sensory systems – not five. The sixth and seventh systems are the senses of motion located in the inner ear. The former signals the {{beginning}} and end of rotation and the latter signals body tilt relative to gravity as well as body translation. The seventh system no longer provides tilt information in weightlessness; however, it does continue to signal translation, so the afferent signals to the CNS are confusing. The experience of living and working in space alters the way the CNS interprets the <b>otolith</b> organ signals during linear acceleration. Although the perception is fairly accurate when subjects are exposed to angular acceleration in yaw in-flight, there are disturbances during angular rotation in pitch and roll, and during linear acceleration along the body transversal and longitudinal axes. Perception of body motion is also altered during the same motion immediately after landing. There is an adaptation to weightlessness in orbit that carries over to post-flight reactions to linear acceleration.|$|E

During this early juvenile stage, there are several dark vertical bars clearly present on the side. Larvae and small juveniles remain offshore, living either at depths of around 10 to 20 m, or congregating around floating objects, particularly Sargassum mats and large jellyfish. As the fish grow, they often move to more inshore lagoons and reefs, before slowly making their way to deeper outer reefs {{at the onset of}} sexual maturity. Absolute growth rates are not well known, but the species has all the adult characteristics by a length of 59.3mm. In all cases studied, there are more females in the adult population than males, with female to male ratios ranging from 1.15F:1M to 1.91F:1M.

These modern data show that the timing of annulus formation in <b>otoliths</b> and vertebrae is more or less similar. Back-calculations on vertebrae and <b>otoliths</b> yield similar growth curves. The age distribution, the edge condition of both vertebrae and <b>otoliths,</b> and the growth rate obtained on the material from Raversijde all show that the plaice from the studied assemblage were captured during spring {{in the southern part of}} the North Sea.
