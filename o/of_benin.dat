5|$|Spotted hyenas feature {{prominently}} in the rituals of certain African cultures. In the Gelede cult of the Yoruba people <b>of</b> <b>Benin</b> and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted hyena mask is used at dawn to signal {{the end of the}} èfè ceremony. As the spotted hyena usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E
5|$|After Wizkid tweeted a {{subliminal}} {{message and}} tweaked his Twitter account, reports about his departure from E.M.E went viral. Wizkid {{moved out of}} the E.M.E mansion in Lagos and acquired his own home in the Lekki Phase 1 area. Prior to Wizkid's subliminal tweets, Banky W pacified fans by assuring them that nothing was amiss. Furthermore, it was reported that troubles within E.M.E started as early as the 2012 E.M.E all stars concert. It was also reported that money was at the centre of the controversy. On 20 February 2013, Information Nigeria reported that Wizkid was getting 25 percent from every performance, while Banky W and Segun Demuren were getting 50 percent. Osagie, Wizkid's former manager, was getting the remaining 25 percent. After firing Osagie and hiring Godwin Tom (whom he parted ways with in April 2014), Wizkid wanted a 50–50 share with Banky W. The source revealed that Banky W refused to accept Wizkid's proposal. Moreover, it was reported that Banky W wanted to find a manager for Wizkid who would accept 25 percent. It was also reported that things started getting sour as a result of both parties disagreement. Information Nigeria went on to report that Wizkid was doing three shows weekly and bringing in close to ₦24 million monthly. On 30 April 2013, Nigerian Entertainment Today reported that Wizkid and E.M.E reunited after contract negotiations. The news source also reported that Wizkid performed alongside label mates Shaydee and DJ Xclusive in The Republic <b>of</b> <b>Benin.</b> In August 2014, Wizkid told Olisa Adibua that he will depart the label following the release of his second studio album, Ayo.|$|E

25|$|In the 16th century, Lagos {{island was}} reputedly sacked by {{troops of the}} Oba <b>of</b> <b>Benin</b> during that kingdom's expansionary phase. It became known as Eko.

The Idejo aristocracy remained Yoruba. Ashipa's son built his palace on Lagos Island, and his grandson moved the seat of government to the palace from the Iddo peninsula. In 1730 the Oba of Lagos invited Portuguese slave traders to the island, where soon a flourishing trade developed.|$|E
