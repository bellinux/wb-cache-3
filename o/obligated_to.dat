40|$|Dung fungi, such as Sordaria fimicola, {{generally}} reproduce sexually with ascospores {{discharged from}} mammalian dung after passage through herbivores. Their life cycle is thought <b>to</b> be <b>obligate</b> <b>to</b> dung, and thus their ascospores in Quaternary sediments have been interpreted {{as evidence of}} past mammalian herbivore activity. Reports of dung fungi as endophytes would seem to challenge the view that they are <b>obligate</b> <b>to</b> dung. However, endophyte status is controversial because surface-sterilization protocols could fail to kill dung fungus ascospores stuck to the plant surface. Thus, we first tested the ability of representative isolates of three common genera of dung fungi to affect plant growth and fecundity given that significant effects on plant fitness could not result from ascospores merely stuck to the plant surface. Isolates of S. fimicola, Preussia sp., and Sporormiella sp. reduced growth and fecundity of two of three populations of Bromus tectorum, the host from {{which they had been}} isolated. In further work with S. fimicola we showed that inoculations of roots of B. tectorum led to some colonization of aboveground tissues. The same isolate of S. fimicola reproduced sexually on inoculated host plant tissues as well as in dung after passage through sheep, thus demonstrating a facultative rather than an obligate life cycle. Finally, plants inoculated with S. fimicola were not preferred by sheep; preference had been expected if the fungus were <b>obligate</b> <b>to</b> dung. Overall, these findings make us question the assumption that these fungi are <b>obligate</b> <b>to</b> dung...|$|R

Chapters describes the term "credit" and the difference between his legal and economic sense for society.

Most important part of my thesis examines relevant Czech legislation of the credit contract, his meaning in system of law, necessary and unnecessaty part of loan agreement, diferrent kind of legal security of provided money and the special possition of bank like a creditor.

5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, has argued that the constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's view, only a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid.

Brody has put forth a unique theory that the legality of the NPVIC could potentially hinge on the notion that faithless electors are not necessarily <b>obligated</b> <b>to</b> vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E
