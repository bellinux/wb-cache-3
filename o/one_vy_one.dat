50|$|There {{have been}} {{conflicting}} {{opinions of the}} properties of <b>VY</b> CMa. In <b>one</b> view, the star {{is a very large}} and very luminous red hypergiant. The various larger estimates of the size and luminosity fall outside the bounds of current stellar theory, both beyond the maximum predicted size of any star and far cooler than a star of its luminosity can become. In another opinion (such as Massey, Levesque, and Plez's study), the star is a normal red supergiant, with a radius around 600 solar radii and falling comfortably inside models of stellar structure and evolution. More recent papers produce intermediate values for radius and luminosity, falling at the very extreme for the expected size and luminosity of red supergiants (or hypergiant based on its emission spectrum and high mass loss rate).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, network flow {{algorithms}} for bipartite {{networks are}} studied. A network G = (V. E) is called bipartite if its vertex set V can be partitioned into two subsets V 1 and V 2 such that all edges have <b>one</b> endpoint in <b>VY</b> {{and the other}} in V 2. Let n = I., nl = ll I 1, n = IV 21, m = El and assume without loss of generality that n s < n 2. A bipartite network is called unbalanced if n << n and balanced otherwise. (This notion is necessarily imprecise.) It is shown that several maximum flow algorithms can be substantially sped up when applied to unbalanced networks. The basic idea in these improvements is a ntwo-edge push rule that allows one to &quot;charge&quot; most computation to vertices in VI, and hence develop algorithms whose running times depend on n rather than n. For example, it is shown that the two-edge push version of Goldberg and Tarjan's FIFO preflow-push algorithm runs in O(nlm + n 3) time and that the analogous version of Ahuja and Orlin's excess scaling algorithm runs in O(n m + n log U) time, where U is the largest edge capacity. These ideas are also extended to dynamic tree implementations, parametric maximum flows, and minimum-cost flows...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} hedging process in L´ vy markets. It consists of e three self-contained chapters. In Chapter 1, we study some results from Malliavin calculus and their applications to the hedging problem. We {{set up a}} market with finite number of assets each driven by a L´ vy process {{and focus on the}} hedging problem. A selfe financing trading strategy is designed to perfectly hedge (if possible) a given contingent claim. If a perfect hedging is not possible, it is designed to approximately hedge a given contingent claim. In general, such a market is not complete and only a small subset of square integrable contingent claims can be hedged. For other claims, a minimum variance hedging strategy is given in literature in terms of Malliavin derivative of contingent claims and assets in the market. We review this result. Such a finite market can be completed by power jump assets. Malliavin derivative of each power jump asset is a polynomial and these polynomials are dense in square Lebesgue-integrable functions. In particular, Malliavin derivative of a contingent claim gives us a square integrable function and it can be approximated by Malliavin derivative of power jump assets. This result shows that enlarged market by infinitely many power jump assets gives us a market complete in the limit. In other words, a contingent claim in such a market (complete in the limit) can be either hedged perfectly or there exists a sequence of contingent claims, each can be hedged perfectly, such that mean squared hedging error goes to zero. Chapter 2 focuses on hedging in Heath-Jarrow-Morton model (HJM). We assume that forward rates are driven by a L´ vy process and summarize no- e arbitrage conditions in HJM framework. We develop necessary and sufficient conditions for perfect hedging of a contingent claim by a self-financing trading strategy. These conditions give us two integral equations: one eliminates Brownian motion related risk and another eliminates jump risk. The latter one {{takes the form of a}} Fredholm integral equation of the first kind and it does not have a solution for all possible square integrable contingent claims. Both integral equations have kernels in terms of forward rates and both equations are solved for Malliavin derivatives in different directions. First, we derive the solutions for the hedging problem when the market is driven by a pure jump process. Our analysis shows that under certain conditions, all power jump assets can be perfectly hedged. This result gives us sufficient conditions for a market which is complete in the limit. Further, we extend our results for a general L´ vy process. e As an application of our approach, we develop a hedging strategy for a variance swap which can be approximately hedged. We also obtain the Malliavin derivative of a caplet. Chapter 3 investigates hedging in exponential L´ vy markets. First, we ree view the call option pricing model that is derived on the basis of Fourier transform. Using Malliavin calculus, we develop the necessary and sufficient conditions for perfect hedging of a contingent claim by a self-financing trading strategy of call options. These conditions give us two integral equations: the first one relates to hedge of Brownian motion related risk and the other deals with hedging jump risk. First, we assume that market is driven by a pure jump process and jump sizes are bounded. In this case, we have only one integral equation which is related to jump risk. The integral equation is transformed into a con- volution type integral equation and a closed form solution for a dense subset of square integrable contingent claims is obtained in terms of Fourier transform and Malliavin calculus. We extend these results to general L´ vy process with e bounded jump sizes. Our approach can be used in practice to develop dynamic hedging strategies using call options. The above results have important implications for hedging in exponential L´ <b>vy</b> market: <b>one</b> key implication is that for e each possible jump size we need a call option with a strike value equal to jump size. We also show some results related to Asian options in exponential L´ vy e markets. Finally, we outline the major limitations of our approach. 2019 - 05 - 2...|$|R
40|$|The general {{evolution}} of stars with initial mass between 0. 8 and 8 solar masses {{is believed to}} be well understood until the last stages, when significant mass loss starts. However, an initially spherical star may evolve into an asymmetrical planetary nebula (PN), whereas the underlying mechanism to this process remains as a puzzle. Until about a decade ago, it was believed that stars in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase were still spherically symmetric. Nevertheless, observations performed in the last years show that, for some sources, elongated and asymmetrical envelopes can already be detected during the AGB phase. In the following pre-PN and planetary nebula phases, a variety of morphologies is observed, and the sources are classified into round, elliptical/elongated, bipolar, quadrupolar, multipolar, spiral, collimated lobes and irregular. It is unknown which mechanism or set of mechanisms is responsible for this change of morphology, making this topic {{to be one of the}} most discussed by the evolved stars community. To shed some light on this problem, three AGB stars (IK Tau, R Scl, and V 644 Sco) and <b>one</b> red supergiant (<b>VY</b> CMa) were observed at optical wavelengths. We analyzed their dust scattered emission and searched for signs of upcoming asymmetries in their circumstellar envelope. The observations in R band reveal that the dust envelope of the AGB star IK Tau has a global elliptical morphology, and the presence of a central waist is discussed. The observation of VY CMa shows a complex morphology in the very extended nebula that surrounds the source. Furthermore, for the first time the detached shell around the AGB star V 644 Sco was imaged, allowing a better investigation of the mass-loss episodes of the source. The detached shell around R Scl was also imaged and analyzed. The results reported in this thesis add together with previous works, confirming that the loss of spherical symmetry in the circumstellar envelope of evolved stars can already start during the AGB phase. Moreover, we studied one of the mechanisms that can play a role in the shaping process of the circumstellar envelope of these sources: magnetic fields. For this purpose, we investigated 22 GHz H 2 O maser observations around five sources: four AGB stars (IK Tau, RT Vir, IRC+ 60370, and AP Lyn) and one pre-PN (OH 231. 8 + 4. 2). By analyzing the linear and circular polarization in the masers, we detected the presence of magnetic field in four of these five sources. We measured the field strengths to be from a few tens up to a few hundreds of milligauss in the H 2 O maser region (at a few tens of astronomical units from the star). Comparing our results with magnetic field measurements from the literature, obtained at different distances with respect to the stars, we tried to determine the most plausible geometry of the magnetic fields for the observed sources. However, it is not yet definitive if the observed fields are toroidal, poloidal, or dipole. The influence of magnetic fields on the shaping process of the circumstellar envelope of evolved stars is still unclear, but their detection around AGB stars, pre-PNe and PNe supports that they might play a role in the process. More measurements of the strength of the fields, also at different distances to the stars, and the investigation of the geometry of the fields are fundamental for providing better constraints to models, and for the better understanding of this subject...|$|R
