30|$|Sectors were {{classified}} {{according to the}} highest aggregate impact on production and {{with respect to the}} widest diffusion of resources. This classification was then compared to the ranking of the most central sectors in the economy. The top ten sectors with the highest impact on aggregate production in the EU are, in order of magnitude, uranium and thorium ores, motor vehicles, basic metals, office machinery and computers, <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> <b>equipment,</b> recovered secondary raw materials, leather and leather products, food products and beverages, radio television and communication equipment, and coke refined petroleum products and nuclear fuel.|$|E
30|$|If {{we look at}} sectoral {{results in}} S 1 in Table  6, {{domestic}} production increases in construction (1.55 %), other non-metallic products (1.09 %) and wood and wood products (0.34 %). Nonetheless, domestic production declines in almost all other industries such as machinery and equipment, electric and electronic machinery and motor vehicles and <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> <b>equipment.</b> The effects on these sectors are due to the cut down of non-residential private investment motivated by the change in foreign savings. The effects on prices are negligible for all products. This is a savings-driven model, such as private investment adjusts to variations in total savings. The increase in final demand due to public investment is counteracted by the reduction in private investment, and the general equilibrium effects are rather small.|$|E
30|$|In {{the cases}} of Japan and Korea, who have been known as highly {{efficient}} in fossil fuel consumption and environmental friendly in production process, they shared a quite similar PM 2.5 emission structure. The variety of status along the supply chain of these sectors led to the difference of attributions between the production and consumption sides, like China, but with a very small emission amount, even if comparing with other countries. Both Japan and Korea held a large emission in transport equipment sector, which only occupied 2.21 % (or consumption side 6.10 %) of the total emission in China’s case. This is probably because both {{of the two countries}} depended heavily on the manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> <b>equipment.</b> Compared with Japan, PM 2.5 emission embodied in the first industry in Korea was smaller partly due to its limited cultivated land and weaker agriculture.|$|E
30|$|By disaggregating the Latin American effect among sectors, we {{provided}} {{a picture of}} which sectors have been most affected and used our previous findings to {{shed some light on}} the reasons for such heterogeneity. As a result, we found that sectors built during the ISI period such as, motor vehicles and <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> <b>equipments,</b> have been more affected than the average in Latin America, which might be explained by the low import content of their exports. The other sectors, such as IT, computing machinery and communication equipment, besides their small share, have presented the intermediate import ratio and the import content of export as high as in the manufacturing sectors of industrialized countries. The high dependence on imports, typical of these sectors, seems to affect the way they respond to currency appreciation/depreciation. In the case of the computing machinery, for instance, a currency overvaluation will likely increase the growth rate of production due to the reduced cost of imported inputs.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that the seasonals in Indian manufacturing production are affected by rainfall. Since the effect of rainfall comes through agricultural production, this finding {{raises the question of whether}} the effect is through demand channel or supply channel. This paper attempts to provide a preliminary answer to this question by testing for this effect in the production in different sub-sectors within the manufacturing sector. We look at the three subsectors which have more than 10 % weightage each in the index of manufacturing production: (i) food products, (ii) basic chemicals and chemical products (except products of petroleum and coal), and (iii) machinery and <b>equipment</b> (<b>other</b> than <b>transport</b> <b>equipment).</b> As almost all the estimated models show some type of misspecification, we also estimate models that allow for time-variation in this behaviour. We find evidence for effect of rainfall on overall dynamics of all three components studied, and also for significant time variation in this behaviour. Focusing on seasonal component, while estimations were not possible for the basic chemicals and chemical products, for the other two components we find evidence of significant effect of rainfall on seaosonality, indicating both the channels are significant. ...|$|R

30|$|Our result {{points to}} the import content of exports as an {{important}} factor on the sectorial level in explaining the heterogeneous effect of real exchange rate over or undervaluation {{on the performance of}} manufacturing sectors. By disaggregating the Latin American effect we can find some regularities related to that feature: (1) motor vehicles and <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> <b>equipment</b> (Isic 34 and 35) are the most sensitive to changes in the undervaluation index and both present low import ratio and import content of exports when compared to their counterpart in the sample of industrialized countries. (2) The sectors highly dependent on the imports of intermediate goods and with imports content of exports similar to the ones in industrialized economies presented a negative coefficient for the undervaluation index. 11 In these cases, the currency overvaluation causes a nominal cost reduction which may offset the Latin American effect or even increase their growth rate of production rather than decrease it.|$|E

40|$|The article aims at {{identifying}} main structural {{characteristics and}} development trends of business R&D {{support in the}} Czech Republic in the period 2007 – 2015 and their assessment {{in light of the}} development of total R&D expenditures in the business sector. Possible impacts of business research support on R&D expenditure from own resources of businesses and on R&D employment are also examined at the level of individual economic sectors. The volume of support annually allocated from the state budget to non-investment R&D activities of businesses culminated between 2009 and 2012. Compared to domestic companies, the companies in foreign ownership obtained only a quarter of public support but their share in total R&D expenditures in the business sector exceeds over a long period the share of domestic companies. Moreover, the difference has further grown in the last years mainly due to rapid increase of private funding from abroad. As regards to the size of businesses the reduction of public funding in the last years occurred primarily in the group of large businesses. However, the decreasing volume of public funding impacted only minimally on large businesses while the reliance of medium and especially small businesses on public resources is considerably higher. Substantial amounts of R&D support from the state budget were allocated particularly to high-tech and medium high-tech industries: manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products; manufacture of machinery; and manufacture of <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> <b>equipment.</b> Unlike in the majority of industrial branches where the absolute annual amounts of public support decreased during the last years, the amounts allocated to the sector of IT services grew significantly.

40|$|A {{statistical}} summary {{posted on the}} internet by the Commission shows an expansion of ACP exports to the EU of 9 % in 2001 following a record 31 % rise in 2000. The memo expresses the view that this 'suggests the stagnation which characterised EU-ACP trade during the 1990 s may finally be coming to an end'. According to the Commission the increase in ACP exports were mainly of prepared foodstuffs, diamonds, aluminium, cocoa and oil. Five products (oil - 30 %, diamonds - 10 %, cocoa beans - 4 %, wood - 4 % and sugar cane - 3 %) account for 51 % of total ACP exports to the EU. Four ACP countries account for 40 % of total ACP exports to the EU. Finished products made up only 19 % of ACP exports to the EU, of which textiles and clothing and prepared foodstuffs {{were the most important}} categories. Accounting for 3. 4 % and 3 % respectively. Finished products accounted for 16 % of the increase in ACP exports in 2001. The EU accounts for 29 % of total ACP exports (compared to 33 % for the USA), and provides 29 % of all ACP imports (compared to 18 % for the USA). LDC exports to the EU increased by 15 % in 2001. Excluding oil the EU accounts for over 80 % of QUAD (EU, Japan, USA and Canada) imports from African ACP countries (compared to 10 % for the USA). EU exports to the ACP grew 4 % in 2001, following a rise of 21 % in 2000. The most important EU exports are machinery and mechanical equipment (25 %), vehicles, aircraft and <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> <b>equipment</b> (24 %) and chemical products (10 %). The most important ACP markets for EU exports are Nigeria (which takes 18 % of EU exports), Angola (5 %), Ivory Coast (5 %), Gabon (4 %), Cameroon (4 %), Dominican Republic (4 %) and Senegal (4 %). Comment: While the Euro value of ACP exports to the EU increased 43 % between 1999 and 2001 it should be borne in mind that the prices of the major ACP exports to the EU, such as oil, cocoa, coffee, tobacco and aluminium are all denominated in US$. With the Euro devaluing against the US$ by 24 % between 1999 and 2001, a major expansion of the Euro value of ACP exports would be expected simply on the basis of currency fluctuations. Earnings from ACP oil exports alone accounted for fully 60 % of the increase in total ACP exports to the EU between 1999 and 2001. Taking out this oil factor, ACP exports to the EU increased only 17 % between 1999 and 2001. More detailed analysis is required to ascertain whether the increase in the Euro value of ACP exports reflects any underlying structural changes in the ACPs trade with the EU.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The primary {{aim of the research}} project was to present an overview of Britain's relative competitive performance in the postwar period. Previous research in this area has concentrated on either the total economy or on manufacturing. The aim of the project was to broaden the scope of research by examining competitive performance for all sectors of the aggregate economy. To do so, a dataset was constructed to enable measurement of productivity (both labour and total factor productivity) and unit labour costs comparing Britain to four of her major competitors, i. e. the US, France, Germany and Japan. The research was concerned with to what extent the performance at the aggregate economy level was affected by the inclusion of non-market services (health, education and government), which are poorly measured in the national accounts. Differences in performance between service sectors and production industries were also analysed. Main Topics : The dataset contains the raw data necessary to enable an evaluation of Britain's relative competitive performance at the sector level. Hence the dataset contains annual time series, from 1950 to 1995, on real output (generally value added), number of persons engaged, average annual hours worked, net capital stocks, labour force skills and labour's share of value added. It also includes benchmark estimates of relative productivity levels for 1993. The data are available for a maximum of 33 sectors, some of which are broad sectors and some comprise sub-industries with these broad sectors. The sectors included are : 1. Agriculture, forestry and fishing; 2. Mining and oil refining (2. 1 oil and gas extraction, 2. 2 other mining, 2. 3 mineral oil refining); 3. Utilities (3. 1 electricity, 3. 2 gas, 3. 3 water supply); 4. Manufacturing 5. Construction 6. Distributive trades (6. 1 wholesale trade, 6. 2 retail trade, 6. 3 hotels and catering); 7. Transport and communications (7. 1 rail transport, 7. 2 water transport, 7. 3 air transport, 7. 4 other transport & transport services, 7. 5 communications); 8. Financial & business services (8. 1 banking & finance, 8. 2 insurance, 8. 3 business services); 9. Miscellaneous personal services; 10. Non-market services (10. 1 health, 10. 2 education, 10. 3 government) plus the total for the aggregate economy and the total over market sectors (excluding non-market sectors). The manufacturing sectors are : 4. 1. Chemicals and allied products (4. 11 chemicals, 4. 12 rubber and plastics); 4. 2. Metals (4. 21 basic metals and 4. 22 metal products); 4. 3. Engineering industries (4. 31 mechanical engineering, 4. 32 office machinery, 4. 33 electrical engineering, 4. 34 mo tor vehicles, 4. 45 <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> <b>equipment,</b> 4. 36 instrument engineering); 4. 4. Textile and related products (4. 41 textiles, 4. 42 clothing, footwear and leather); 4. 5. Food, drink and tobacco and 4. 6. Other manufacturing (4. 61 non-metallic mineral products, 4. 62 wood & furniture, 4. 63 paper & printing, 4. 64 miscellaneous manufacturing. The data originate from official publications but include adjustment to render them internationally comparable. Data limitations imply that the series are not always available for all sectors in all countries. The most complete data series are for the US, the UK and Germany - less detail is available for France and Japan. The data represent in some cases a complete, and in some cases a partial transcription of original sources. Adjustments were made to the original sources to render them consistent across both time and countries. For example, in constructing real output for the US, the data are those published for Construction, indexed to 1993 = 100. For the communications sector, however, the US industry definition includes telecommunications, radio and TV, whereas communications in all other countries comprise telecommunications and postal services. Hence for the US output of the postal services (included with the Federal Government) was estimated and added to output in telecommunications. For further details, please see documentation. The dataset contains the following files : NISECQ. xls: Real value added by sector, (index, 1993 = 100). NISECMQ. xls: Real value added in manufacturing industries, (index, 1993 = 100). NISECE. xls: Number of persons engaged by sector, (thousands of persons). NISECME. xls: Number of persons engaged in manufacturing, (thousands of persons).
