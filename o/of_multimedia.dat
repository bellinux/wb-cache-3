Drowned Gods concept and visuals were widely praised, while its gameplay, audio, and puzzles received more varied responses. A planned sequel never came to fruition.|$|E

Palmer discovered that Jamaican children's interest dropped during segments with the Muppets, possibly due to language and cultural differences; musical segments were the most effective. The children's learning increased after exposure to the show, especially letter and number recognition.|$|E

Therefore, the research on the vulnerability <b>of</b> IP <b>multimedia</b> subsystems attracts widespread attention recently. In this article, the security threats of next-generation core networks are discussed first. And then we analyze the vulnerability characteristics <b>of</b> IP <b>multimedia</b> subsystems. In order to evaluate the vulnerability <b>of</b> IP <b>multimedia</b> subsystems effectively, this paper further applies the complex network theory to construct the network model <b>of</b> IP <b>multimedia</b> subsystem and propose the vulnerability assessment indicator by adopting entropy model. Finally, some simulation experiments and result analysis are provided to our evaluation model. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations indicate that the proposed vulnerability measurement is a simple and effective new method to evaluate the overall vulnerability of this kind <b>of</b> IP <b>multimedia</b> subsystems. In addition, the proposed method provides a new idea and scientific basis for the vulnerability assessment <b>of</b> IP <b>multimedia</b> subsystems...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} <b>of</b> interactive <b>multimedia</b> {{content is}} {{in most cases}} an expensive task {{in terms of time}} and cost. It must hence be the goal to optimize the production by exploiting the reusability <b>of</b> interactive <b>multimedia</b> elements. Reusability can be triggered by a combination <b>of</b> reusable <b>multimedia</b> components, together with the appropriate use of metadata to control the components as well as their combination. In this article, we discuss reusability and adaptability aspects <b>of</b> interactive <b>multimedia</b> content in web-based learning systems. In contrast to existing approaches, we extend a component-based architecture to build up interactive multimedia visualization units by the use of metadata for reusability and customizability issues. 1...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this mini thesis is to {{investigate}} the research question, "What is the importance and effectiveness of public relations practice in obtaining coverage in a multimedia newspaper?" It {{is obvious that the}} introduction <b>of</b> the <b>multimedia</b> newspaper has affected the role of the public relations practitioner {{and the role of the}} journalists. But has it changed the manner in which public relations practitioners practice public relations (that is the influence <b>of</b> the <b>multimedia</b> newspaper on the public relations industry) and its value in the eyes <b>of</b> the <b>multimedia</b> journalist. The study will measure the multimedia editorial staff's opinion and perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>multimedia</b> newspapers content and public relations practice's impact on that content. The research is interested in whether the introduction <b>of</b> the <b>multimedia</b> newspaper has affected the role of the public relations practitioner and the journalists and whether it has changed the manner in which public relations practitioners practice public relations (that is the influence <b>of</b> the <b>multimedia</b> newspaper on the public relations industry).

5|$|Nationwide, {{there are}} three state-run and three private TV networks. All provide live music {{at least some of}} the time, thus giving work to musicians, singers, and dancers. Many large cities in Italy have local TV stations, as well, which may provide live folk or dialect music often of {{interest}} only to the immediate area. Book and CD superstores have entered the Italian market over the last decade. The largest of these chains is Feltrinelli, originally a publishing house in the 1950s. In 2001, it geared up to the level <b>of</b> <b>Multimedia</b> Store and now sells massive quantities of recorded music. There are, as of 2006, 14 such mega-stores in Italy, with more planned.

Moreover, it covers the students’ responses toward the use <b>of</b> interactive <b>multimedia.</b> The research design employed in this study was quasi experimental in which the participants were 56 students from two classes. The data were obtained from several instruments, pre-test,post-test, questionnaire, and students’ interview. The findings indicate that the use <b>of</b> Interactive <b>Multimedia</b> had significantly improved students’ reading ability in descriptive text. The results show that t obtain value (6. 159) was higher than t critical value (2. 055) at the level of significance 0. 05 (two-tailed). Apparently, it indicates that the null hypothesis (H 0) isrejected. In addition, the result of data analysis from questionnaire and interview showed that the use <b>of</b> Interactive <b>Multimedia</b> was positively responded by all students. Considering the findings, it is recommended tha the use <b>of</b> Interactive <b>Multimedia</b> in teaching reading helps Junior High School students comprehend descriptive text better...|$|R

5|$|The {{inclusion}} <b>of</b> <b>multimedia</b> software as {{a special}} feature was a novelty when Chrysalis Records released the Billy Idol's Cyberpunk diskette. This was also widely adopted by the music industry years later. CD-ROMs were initially considered as a medium for Cyberpunks multimedia features, but were too expensive {{at the time of}} production, and so floppy disks were used instead. Peter Gabriel and Todd Rundgren had previously experimented with CD-ROMs, but it was hoped that if Idol's album had proved popular, it could have been reissued with CD-ROMs, catapulting the format into the music industry's mainstream. This never materialised due to the album's general failures. However, during the late '90s it became increasingly common for some limited edition digipaks to include CD-ROMs, evolving by the early 2000s into the inclusion of DVDs.|$|E
25|$|Multimedia {{advertising}} {{is the result}} of animation and graphic designs used to sell products or services. There are various forms <b>of</b> <b>multimedia</b> advertising through videos, online advertising and DVDs, CDs etc. These outlets afford companies the ability to increase their customer base through multimedia advertising. This is a necessary contribution to the marketing of the products and services. For instance, online {{advertising is}} a new wave example towards the use <b>of</b> <b>multimedia</b> in advertising that provides many benefits to the online companies and traditional corporations. New technologies today have brought on an evolution <b>of</b> <b>multimedia</b> in advertising and a shift from traditional techniques. The importance <b>of</b> <b>multimedia</b> advertising is significantly increased for companies in their effectiveness to market or sell products and services. Corporate advertising concerns itself with the idea that “Companies are likely to appeal to a broader audience and increase sales through search engine optimization, extensive keyword research, and strategic linking.” The concept behind the advertising platform can span across multiple mediums, yet, at its core, be centered around the same scheme.|$|E
