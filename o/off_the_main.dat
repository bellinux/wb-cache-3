5|$|The {{model for}} the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a closed binary star system. The larger of the two stars is the first to evolve <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> sequence, and it expands to form a red giant. The two stars now share a common envelope, causing their mutual orbit to shrink. The giant star then sheds most of its envelope, losing mass until it can no longer continue nuclear fusion. At this point it becomes a white dwarf star, composed primarily of carbon and oxygen. Eventually the secondary star also evolves <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> sequence to form a red giant. Matter from the giant is accreted by the white dwarf, causing the latter to increase in mass. Despite widespread acceptance of the basic model, the exact details of initiation and of the heavy elements produced in the catastrophic event are still unclear.|$|E

To {{the west of}} the town, {{on the edge of the}} Mendip Hills, there are large active limestone quarries, such as Whatley Quarry and Merehead Quarry, along with disused quarries.

5|$|In a 1960 paper, American {{astronomer}} Olin J.

Members of the group are of a similar age, and those that are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun have moved <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> sequence after exhausting their core hydrogen reserves and are expanding and cooling into red giants.|$|E

5|$|Two star {{systems have}} had exoplanets {{discovered}} by doppler spectroscopy, and the substellar companion {{of a third}} star system—the sunlike star HD 131664—has since {{been found to be}} a brown dwarf with a calculated mass of the companion to 23 times that of Jupiter (minimum of 18 and maximum of 49 Jovian masses). HD 134606 is a yellow sunlike star of spectral type G6IV that has begun expanding and cooling <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> sequence. Three planets orbit it with periods of 12, 59.5 and 459 days, successively larger as they are further away from the star. HD 137388 is another star—of spectral type K2IV—that is cooler than the Sun and has begun cooling <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> sequence. Around 47% as luminous and 88% as massive as the Sun, with 85% of its diameter, it is thought to be around 7.4 ± 3.9 billion years old. It has a planet that is 79 times as massive as the Earth and orbits its sun every 330 days at an average distance of 0.89 astronomical units (AU).|$|E
5|$|US41 {{was first}} {{designated}} as a US Highway in 1926. A section of the highway originally served as part of Military Road, a connection between Fort Wilkins and Fort Howard during the Civil War. US41 replaced the original M-15 designation of the highway which dated back {{to the formation of}} the Michigan state trunkline highway system. M-15 ran from Menominee through Marquette to Houghton and ended in Copper Harbor. Realignments and construction projects have expanded the highway to four lanes in Delta and Marquette counties and have created three business loops <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> highway.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it appears}} to be a single star to the naked eye, Capella is {{actually}} a system of four stars in two binary pairs. The first pair consists of two bright yellow giant stars, both of which are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun. They have exhausted their core hydrogen, and cooled and swollen, moving <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> sequence. Designated Capella Aa and Capella Ab, they are in a very tight circular orbit some 0.76 astronomical units (au) apart, and orbit each other every 104 days. Capella Aa is the cooler and more luminous of the two with spectral class K0III; it is 78.7 ± 4.2 times the Sun's luminosity and 11.98 ± 0.57 times its radius.|$|E

5|$|Before the match, the {{decision}} was taken to close the roof on the Millennium Stadium, {{the first time this}} had happened in the United Kingdom. Liverpool lined up in a 4–4–2 formation, with new signing John Arne Riise included in the team, while midfielder Steven Gerrard was absent with an ankle injury. There was also no place for striker Robbie Fowler, who was expected to captain the side. Manchester United lined up in a 4–4–1–1 formation, with Paul Scholes playing just <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> striker, Ruud van Nistelrooy, who made his debut for the club. Van Nistelrooy's fellow new signing, Juan Sebastián Verón, was on international duty with the Argentina national team; his place in midfield was taken by Nicky Butt.|$|E
5|$|During the Lebanese Civil War and the Israeli {{occupation}} of South Lebanon (1985–2000), the temple site was neglected and was invaded by vegetation overgrowth; it was cleared and recovered its former condition after the Israeli withdrawal.

5|$|Eta Hydri is {{the other}} optical double, {{composed}} of Eta1 and Eta2. Eta1 is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B9V that was suspected of being variable, and is located just over 700 light-years away. Eta2 has a magnitude of 4.7 and is a yellow giant star of spectral type G8.5III around 218 light-years distant, which has evolved <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> sequence and is expanding and cooling {{on its way to}} becoming a red giant. Calculations of its mass indicate it was most likely a white A-type main sequence star for most of its existence, around twice the mass of our Sun. A planet, Eta2 Hydri b, greater than 6.5 times the mass of Jupiter was discovered in 2005, orbiting around Eta2 every 711 days at a distance of 1.93 astronomical units (AU).|$|E

5|$|Six star {{systems have}} been found to contain exoplanets, of which two were {{discovered}} by the Doppler method and four by the transit method. 6 Lyncis, an orange subgiant that spent much of its life as an A-type or F-type main sequence star, is orbited by a planet with a minimum mass of 2.4 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 899 days. HD 75898 is a 3.8 ± 0.8 billion-year-old yellow star of spectral type G0V that has just begun expanding and cooling <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> sequence. It has a planet at least 2.51 times as massive as Jupiter orbiting with a period of around 418days. The centre of mass of the system is accelerating, indicating there is a third, more distant, component at least the size of Jupiter. Three star systems were found to have planets that were observed by the XO Telescope in Hawaii as they passed in front of them. XO-2 is a binary star system, both the stars of which are slightly less massive and cooler than the Sun and have planetary companions: XO-2S has a Saturn-mass planet at 0.13 au distance with a period of around 18 days, and one a little more massive than Jupiter at a distance of 0.48 au and with a period of around 120 days, and XO-2N has a hot Jupiter with around half Jupiter's mass that has an orbit of only 2.6 days. XO-4 is an F-type main sequence star that is a little hotter and more massive than the Sun that has a hot Jupiter orbiting with a period of around 4.1 days. XO-5 is a Sun-like star with a hot Jupiter about as massive as Jupiter that takes around 4.2 days to complete an orbit. WASP-13, a Sun-like star that has begun to swell and cool <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> sequence, had a transiting planet discovered by the SuperWASP program in 2009. The planet is around half as massive as Jupiter and takes 4.35 days to complete a revolution.|$|E
5|$|Three stars make up {{the long}} narrow {{triangle}} that gives the constellation its name. The brightest member is the white giant star Beta Trianguli of apparent magnitude 3.00, lying 127 light-years distant from Earth. It is actually a spectroscopic binary system; the primary is a white star of spectral type A5IV with 3.5 times the mass of our sun that is beginning to expand and evolve <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> sequence. The secondary is poorly known, but calculated to be a yellow-white F-type main-sequence star around 1.4 solar masses. The two orbit around a common centre of gravity every 31 days, and are surrounded by a ring of dust that extends from 50 to 400AU away from the stars.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally called Kochab, Beta Ursae Minoris at {{apparent}} magnitude 2.08 {{is only slightly}} less bright than Polaris. Located around 131light-years away from Earth, it is an orange giant—an evolved star that has used up the hydrogen in its core and moved <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> sequence—of spectral type K4III. Slightly variable {{over a period of}} 4.6days, Kochab has had its mass estimated at 1.3times that of the Sun via measurement of these oscillations. Kochab is 450 times more luminous than the Sun and has 42 times its diameter, with a surface temperature of approximately 4,130K. Estimated to be around 2.95 billion years old, give or take 1 billion years, Kochab was announced to have a planetary companion around 6.1times as massive as Jupiter with an orbit of 522days.|$|E
