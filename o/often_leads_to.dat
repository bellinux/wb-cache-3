5|$|Like all New World {{vultures}}, {{it is not}} {{closely related}} to the Old World vultures of Europe, Africa, and Asia. The two groups strongly resemble each other because of convergent evolution; natural selection <b>often</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> similar body plans in animals that adapt independently to the same conditions.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} {{may occur}} {{in association with}} several systemic disorders (see table). These ulcers are clinically and histopathologically identical to the lesions of aphthous stomatitis, but this type of oral ulceration is {{not considered to be}} true aphthous stomatitis by some sources. Some of these conditions may cause ulceration on other mucosal surfaces in addition to the mouth such as the conjunctiva or the genital mucous membranes. Resolution of the systemic condition <b>often</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> decreased frequency and severity of the oral ulceration.|$|E

5|$|Destruction and {{encroachment}} {{of habitat}} by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, {{forcing them to}} nest closer to the surf. Urbanization <b>often</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles {{at or near the}} surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of the city are known as Mysoreans in English and Mysoorinavaru in Kannada. The dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the sharing of Kaveri river water <b>often</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> minor altercations and demonstrations in the city. Growth in the information technology industry in Mysore {{has led to a}} change in the city's demographic profile; likely strains on the infrastructure and haphazard growth of the city resulting from the demographic change have been a cause of concern for some of its citizens.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws hatch asynchronously and {{incubation}} begins before clutch completion, which <b>often</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> {{the death}} of the last-hatched young. If the supply of food is low, parental investment in the brood is kept to a minimum as little energy is wasted on feeding a chick that is unlikely to survive. Replacement clutches are very rarely laid in the event of clutch failure.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines <b>often</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). Bromination <b>often</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination. Bromine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Br bonds.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it <b>often</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated {{blood vessels in the}} esophagus and stomach.|$|E

5|$|The {{prototype}} and series trains have various differences. The {{number of}} seats was increased from 264 to 309 by changing the seat configuration in second class from 2+1 to 2+2. The information screens {{on the outside of}} the carriages were moved from the center of the carriages to next to the doors. There are also differences with the light switch logic, which <b>often</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> the trains running with both front and tail lights on at the same end. The prototypes differed also originally by their restaurant car and Extra class features. They were modified in the mid-2000s to be similar to the series trains.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between fluorine and bromine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Chlorine is a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine but a stronger one than bromine or iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). However, this trend is not shown in the bond energies because fluorine is singular due to its small size, low polarisability, and lack of low-lying d-orbitals available for bonding (which chlorine has). As another difference, chlorine has a significant chemistry in positive oxidation states while fluorine does not. Chlorination <b>often</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> higher oxidation states than bromination or iodination but lower oxidation states to fluorination. Chlorine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Cl bonds.|$|E
5|$|Major Himalayan-origin {{rivers that}} {{substantially}} flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, {{both of which}} drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient <b>often</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.|$|E

5|$|This region's land is {{appropriate}} for agricultural and livestock activities. It is mostly a flat area, interrupted only by the Tandilia and Ventana hills in its southern portion. The climate of the Pampas is temperate and humid with no dry season, featuring hot summers and mild winters (Cfa/Cfb according to the Köppen climate classification). The weather in the Pampas is variable due to the contrasting air masses and frontal storms that impact the region. Maritime polar air from the south produces the cool pampero winds, while warm humid tropical air from the north produces sultry nortes - a gentle wind usually from the northeast formed by trade winds, and the South Atlantic High that brings cloudy, hot, and humid weather and is responsible for bringing heat waves. The Pampas {{are influenced by the}} El Niño–Southern Oscillation which is responsible for variations in annual precipitation. An El Niño year <b>often</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> higher precipitation, while a La Niña year leads to lower precipitation. The Pampas are moderately sunny, ranging from an average of 4–5 hours of sunshine per day during the winter months to 8–9 hours in summer.|$|E
