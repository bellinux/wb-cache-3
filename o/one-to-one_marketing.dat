40|$|Treballs Finals de Grau de Matemàtiques, Facultat de Matemàtiques, Universitat de Barcelona, Any: 2015, Director: Marina NúñezThe {{purpose of}} this degree project is to study two-sided {{matchings}} where money is not involved. Matching theory is a branch of discrete mathematics belonging to game theory. This theory considers markets with two disjoint sets, such as men and women, ﬁrms and workers or colleges and students. Each agent on one sector has preferences (a complete and transitive binary relation) over the set of agents on the opposite side. Then, a matching {{is a set of}} pairs formed by agents of different side, {{in such a way that}} one agent can take part in at most one pair. We can situate its origin in the article of Gale and Shapley (1962) "College admissions and the stability of marriage" followed by the book of Knuth (1976), which ﬁrst edition in French had the title of "Mariages stables". The ﬁrst chapter of this monograph focuses on the theory of one-to-one matching, that is known as the marriage problem. This chapter provides the theoretical basis to develop two-sided matching theory, since the notions of stability and optimality for matchings are studied in depth. Chapter 2 is devoted to many-to-one matching problems, say the college admission problem, to analyse until which extent the results obtained for <b>one-to-one</b> <b>markets</b> still hold. In these two chapters the existence of stable matchings, their properties and the structure of the set of stable matchings are studied. Chapter 3 is a real-life application of the theory of matchings: the school choice problem. Here, we are going to analyse which algorithms have been used to fairly assign children to schools. This problem is currently under study, approached from the ﬁelds of mathematics, economics, operations research or computer science...|$|R
40|$|We study a {{labor market}} with finitely many {{heterogeneous}} workers and firms {{to illustrate the}} decentralized (myopic) blocking dynamics in two-sided <b>one-to-one</b> matching <b>markets</b> with continuous side payments (assignment problems, Shapley and Shubik [24]). Assuming individual rationality, a labor market is unstable if {{there is at least}} one blocking pair, that is, a worker and a firm who would prefer to be matched to each other in order to obtain higher payoffs than the payoffs they obtain by being matched to their current partners. A blocking path is a sequence of outcomes (specifying matchings and payoffs) such that each outcome is obtained from the previous one by satisfying a blocking pair (i. e., by matching the two blocking agents and assigning new payoffs to them that are higher than the ones they received before). We are interested in the question if starting from any (unstable) individually rational outcome, there always exists a blocking path that will lead to a stable outcome. In contrast to discrete versions of the model (i. e., for marriage <b>markets,</b> <b>one-to-one</b> matching, or discretized assignment problems), the existence of blocking paths to stability cannot always be guaranteed. We identify a necessary and sufficient condition for an assignment problem (the existence of a stable outcome such that all matched agents receive positive payoffs) to guarantee the existence of paths to stability and show how to construct such a path whenever this is possible...|$|R

5000|$|Kaplan categorizes mobile {{marketing}} {{along the}} degree of consumer knowledge and the trigger of communication into four groups: strangers, groupies, victims, and patrons. Consumer knowledge can be high or low and according to its degree organizations can customize their messages to each individual user, similar {{to the idea of}} <b>one-to-one</b> <b>marketing.</b> Regarding the trigger of communication, Kaplan differentiates between push communication, initiated by the organization, and pull communication, initiated by the consumer. Within the first group (low knowledge/push), organizations broadcast a general message to a large number of mobile users. Given that the organization cannot know which customers have ultimately been reached by the message, this group is referred to as [...] "strangers". Within the second group (low knowledge/pull), customers opt to receive information but do not identify themselves when doing so. The organizations therefore does not know which specific clients it is dealing with exactly, which is why this cohort is called [...] "groupies". In the third group (high knowledge/push) referred to as [...] "victims", organizations know their customers and can send them messages and information without first asking permission. The last group (high knowledge/pull), the [...] "patrons" [...] covers situations where customers actively give permission to be contacted and provide personal information about themselves, which allows for one-to-one communication without running the risk of annoying them.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} inquiry for this {{dissertation}} is the tribalisation {{of society and}} its impact on the conduct of communication practice. The dissertation presents an alternative to the characterization of postmodernity as an urge to celebrate freedom from social constraints. Our thesis is that people gather together in tribes and re-establish communal embeddedness. Thus people are less interested in the objects of consumption than in the social links and identities that come with them. 	This renewed sense of community presents communication and marketing practitioners with new challenges as the communities are inherently unstable, small-scale, affectual and not fixed by any of the established parameters of modern society. These communities are held together essentially through shared emotion and they exist in no other form but the symbolically and ritually manifested commitment by their members. Furthermore the social, proximate characters of these communities are more affective and influential on people’s behaviour than traditional notions such as market segmentation, atomistic <b>markets</b> and <b>one-to-one</b> relationship <b>marketing.</b> With an example of community phenomenon around New Age we explore the constitution of what we designate cultural communities in postmodernity and present new concepts and tools for communication and marketing practitioners to work with this cultural community phenomenon in their communication strategy...|$|R
