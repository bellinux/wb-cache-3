40|$|Abstract—Mobile {{phones are}} truly {{personal}} devices loaded with personal data such as photos, contacts, and call history. Yet {{it is often}} necessary or desirable to share <b>our</b> <b>phones</b> with others. This is especially true as mobile phones are integrating features conventionally provided by other dedicated devices, from MP 3 players to games consoles. Yet existing phones assume a single user and provide little protection for private data and applications when a phone is shared. That is, when we lend <b>our</b> <b>phones</b> to others, we give away complete access. In this work, we present xShare, a protection solution to address this problem. xShare allows phone owners to rapidly specify {{what they want to}} share and place the phone into a restricted mode where only the data and applications intended for sharing can be accessed. We first present two formative user studies and derive the design requirements of xShare. We then offer the design of xShare based on file-level access control. We describe the implementation of xShare on Windows Mobile and report a comprehensive evaluation, including performance measurements, usability, and a one-month field trial. Index Terms—Mobile phone, sharing, privacy, virtualization. ...|$|R

We seek to deliver your information during your morning routine and throughout the day, when taking out your phone is not always possible. This will cater to a larger audience base, as the average consumer nowadays hopes to accomplish tasks with minimal active interaction with their adopted technology. This idea has many future applications, such as integration with new virtual or augmented reality devices, or simplifying consumer personal media sources...|$|R
