5|$|Dragon Quest VII is {{best known}} for its huge size. Without {{completing}} the game's side quests, a single game of Dragon Quest VII can take a hundred hours or more. In terms of gameplay, not much has changed from previous installments; battles are still fought in a turn-based mode from a first person perspective. Although non-battle sequences are rendered in 3D, battles themselves are still portrayed two dimensionally. The ability to talk with the party characters in and outside of battles was added to this game. They <b>offer</b> <b>advice</b> about battle strategies and plot points, or simply comment on how they feel at a given moment. There are four ways and means of locomotion: feet, boat, magic carpet, and skystone. Each of these can move across different terrain.|$|E

25|$|Usually, the bowler {{decides what}} type of {{delivery}} to bowl next, without consultation or even informing any other member of his team. Sometimes, the team captain will <b>offer</b> <b>advice</b> or even issue a direct order regarding what deliveries to bowl, based on his observations of the batsman and the strategic state of the game. Another player who occasionally offers advice to the bowler is the wicket-keeper, since he has a unique view of the batsman and {{may be able to}} spot weaknesses of technique.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{was forced}} by post-lingual {{deafness}} {{as an early}} teen to communicate by letters throughout his professional life. This effort created a written network for scholars interested in Western American themes. Vast stores of correspondence indicate his willingness to help another writer or scholar, to provide information on sources and materials, or <b>offer</b> <b>advice</b> on projects. Many emerging scholars, particularly those out of the academic mainstream, considered him a mentor. As a result, Morgan {{stood in the center}} of a scholarly group of literary figures of the 1930s through 1960s involved in history and biography of the American West. These individuals included Juanita Brooks, Fawn Brodie, Bernard DeVoto, Charles Kelly, J. Roderic Korns, A. Russell Mortensen, William Mulder, and Harold Schindler.|$|E

25|$|Since Baptism {{can only}} be {{received}} once, the sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation is the principal means by which Catholics may obtain forgiveness for subsequent sin and receive God's grace and assistance not to sin again. This is based on Jesus' words to his disciples in the Gospel of John 20:21–23. A penitent confesses his sins to a priest who may then <b>offer</b> <b>advice</b> or impose a particular penance to be performed. The penitent then prays an act of contrition and the priest administers absolution, formally forgiving the person of his sins. A priest is forbidden under penalty of excommunication to reveal any matter heard under the seal of the confessional. Penance helps prepare Catholics before they can validly receive the Holy Spirit in the sacraments of Confirmation (Chrismation) and the Eucharist.|$|E
25|$|The {{redundancy}} notices {{were issued}} on 27 September, {{together with a}} letter from the council's leader and deputy leader (John Hamilton and Derek Hatton) explaining that there was no intention to make any employee redundant but that the notices were a legal requirement. With time running out, the council had to hire taxis to distribute the notices. At the Labour Party conference the following week, David Blunkett agreed with Hatton that the GLC's Director-General Maurice Stonefrost could <b>offer</b> <b>advice</b> to Liverpool. Stonefrost suggested increasing rates by 15%, and cutting the housing programme. The council's budget problems for the 1985–86 financial year were only solved when the council removed £23m from its capital budget to fund revenue spending, and borrowed £30m from Swiss banks to replenish the capital fund. The council also transferred £3m in loans which it had given to other Labour councils and found £3m of budget savings. The council's Finance Committee approved this plan on 26 November 1985.|$|E
25|$|Mass Effect: Andromeda {{was built}} using EA DICE's Frostbite 3 engine, which {{required}} that BioWare construct all systems, tools, and assets from scratch as {{the series was}} previously built on Epic Games' Unreal Engine. Going into development, the company knew that the transition to Frostbite would be a difficult one, having already made the switch for Dragon Age: Inquisition, which proved to be extremely challenging as the engine was not designed with role-playing games in mind. In an effort to optimize the engine's capabilities, BioWare would sometimes enlist the help of other Frostbite developers. For example, {{to ensure that the}} game's driving mechanics handled well, BioWare invited the Need for Speed team to come onsite and <b>offer</b> <b>advice</b> and guidance. BioWare tried to push the boundaries of the software, particularly in the area of character animation, but struggled with facial animations in particular. This was due in part to struggles with various animation programs, an understaffed development team, and a delayed production cycle.|$|E

25|$|Besides, Landale {{was one of}} {{the leading}} {{businessmen}} in the colony who repeatedly opposed the introduction of income tax. As early as during the Second World War, the government proposed for the introduction of the tax to support the British war effort in Europe and to subsidise the local defence budget. Landale {{was one of the}} members who were appointed to the War Revenue Committee by the government in October 1939, which was tasked to <b>offer</b> <b>advice</b> on the proposed new tax. The Committee later submitted its report in February 1940 in which Landale and other members expressed strong reservations about the tax proposal. Despite of their reservations, the government eventually managed to secure the support of the Committee to introduce the income tax in April 1940, having promised that the tax, as an interim measure to generate war revenue, would be repealed after the war. Ironically, although the government did repeal the tax after the war as promised, the tax was soon re-introduced in 1947, a move which was strongly opposed by Landale and other unofficial members of the Legislative Council. In response to the tax proposal, Landale requested that it should be put on hold for a year to have sufficient time for further review, but his request was turned down by the government. After heated debates, the bill to reintroduce the tax was read a third time and was passed in the Legislative Council in May 1947, notwithstanding that it was rarely voted against by three unofficial members, namely Chau Tsun-nin, Chau Sik-nin and Leo d'Almada e Castro. Landale, however, was compelled to vote for the Bill during the division.|$|E

She frequently reiterates her intense dislike of Ko throughout the series and often squabbles with him. Despite this, she is very like him in behavior and talents, as several characters comment. After Ko becomes the ace pitcher of Seishu High School, Aoba slowly comes to admit his qualities as a player, and becomes less reluctant to <b>offer</b> <b>advice</b> and even teaches him new breaking pitches.

500|$|Mary {{joined the}} Melbourne District Nursing Society in 1931 and was its vice {{president}} from 1943 to 1953. She banded together with George Simpson and Victor Wallace {{to establish the}} Women's Welfare Clinic to <b>offer</b> <b>advice</b> on birth control, {{at a time when}} many doctors and a large segment of the community were opposed to it. This clinic functioned for one day a week until 1945 when it was discontinued, as the advice it offered could by then be obtained elsewhere. The social mores of the time often kept young women ignorant of matters dealing with sex and pregnancy, but she recognised that pregnant women in particular needed more information about what was happening to them. [...] "She broke taboos", Della Hilton later wrote, and [...] "made forbidden subjects not only matters for discussion, but for action".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed at the Warner Bros. Television studios in Burbank, California on October 15, 1997.

Gomez quipped that having two guys paint his body in make-up was [...] "more embarrassing" [...] than filming the routine, while Stiles joked that the episode {{was the first time}} he had been [...] "totally naked" [...] since he was cast in the show. Carey admitted that he was grateful that stripping during prime-time had to be PG and apologized that viewers had to see his naked buttocks. He also clarified that the cast wore pouches to protect their modesty.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, two amateur {{researchers}} named Daniel Dvorak and Matthew Myers proposed Mayfield as {{a suspect}} once again, asserting that they had assembled a convincing circumstantial case that would be detailed in a forthcoming book.

(Himmelsbach said the FBI never called Mayfield.) [...] Mayfield further charged that Dvorak and Myers asked him to play along with their theory, and [...] "we'll all make a lot of money".

500|$|Of {{the three}} schools, St. Lulim has the least {{emphasis}} on romance between characters, although the Lulim characters are typically found together. The leader of their friendly group is Chikaru Minamoto, the student council president of Lulim, and a born leader. She has a friendly and supportive personality which she often uses to <b>offer</b> <b>advice</b> {{or simply a}} shoulder to cry on. The other three girls include Kizuna Hyūga, a very outgoing and excitable girl who enjoys following Chikaru's decisions, finding fun in doing so. She is very expressive in her actions and words, not wasting a chance to introduce herself to anyone new. Her close friend is Remon Natsume, who is much like Kizuna in personality, but is not as accident-prone as her. Of the pair, Kizuna is the more talkative; Remon often agrees with her companion and will offer up an opinion when need be. Lastly, there is Kagome Byakudan, {{the youngest of the}} group, who is typically accompanied by her stuffed bear [...] which she often talks to as if it were alive. Although she does not talk or express her emotions much, she has a heightened perception of others' emotions and can tell when those around her are distraught or in emotional pain.|$|E
