The <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> is held a set {{distance}} away from the eye of the surveyor. Most <b>angle</b> <b>gauges</b> have a string or chain that lets the user know the set distance. Each <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> is set at a certain basal area factor (BAF). Each tree that is in the plot represents this number, the BAF, of square footage. It is multiplied by the number of trees on the plot to give basal area per acre. In the United States BAF is measured in units of square feet. For example, using a BAF 10 <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> a forester measures 12 trees that are in trees. Therefore, this plot represents [...]|$|R
5000|$|An <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> {{is a tool}} used by foresters to {{determine}} which trees to measure when using a variable radius plot design in forest inventory. Using this tool a forester can quickly measure the trees that are {{in or out of}} the plot. An <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> is a very similar tool to a wedge prism though it must be held a fixed distance from your eye for it to work properly. Unlike the wedge prism, which is held over the plot center, the surveyor's eye is kept over plot center when using an <b>angle</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{a concept}} that comes from {{variable}} radius plots, or point sampling. It happens when a tree cannot be easily determined as in or out when using a prism or <b>angle</b> <b>gauge.</b> Borderline trees occur only when the distance from the sampling point {{to the center of the}} tree is equal to the DBH times plot radius factor (PRF). The PRF is determined based on the type of prism or <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> being used. Basal Area Factor (BAF) 5, 10, and 20 <b>angle</b> <b>gauges</b> result in PRFs of 3.89, 2.75, and 1.94 (feet inch−1) respectively. The metric equivalents of these PRFs are 0.467, 0.33, and 0.233 (m cm−1).|$|R

50|$|Some {{trees are}} on the {{borderline}} of the plot and must be checked {{to be sure they}} are to be included. The limiting distance must be calculated to see if the trees are in or out. The equation to calculate the limiting distance in feet is Diameter at breast height, DBH, in inches times plot radius factor, PRF, in feet/area Dlim=DBH*PRF For example, using a BAF 10 <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> a forester needs to know the limiting distance for a 20 in tree. The PRF using a 10 BAF <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> is 2.75 ft for every inch of tree diameter. Therefore, 20 inches * 2.75 ft/inch = 55 ft. This means that a 20 in tree must be over 55 ft away {{from the center of the}} plot using a BAF 10 <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> to be out of the plot.|$|R
40|$|To realise precise, {{real-time}} {{measurement of}} forest volume, this study discusses {{the principles and}} method of forest volume measurement when utilizing an electronic gauge. Use of the electronic gauge, to count trees within five concentric circles, resulted in {{a decrease in the}} variation of estimated forest volume, as the number of circles increased. This estimate became reliable upon reaching the fourth concentric circle. In contrast, the use of a conventional <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> revealed no obvious regularity and no significant trend using multiple observation points. As well, for forest inventory plots with uneven spatial distribution, there was relatively low precision when using multiple observation points with a conventional angle gauge: the relative errors of forest volume measurement reached almost 40 % in the first plot using multiple observation points. The electronic <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> is comprised of a telescope and Charge Coupled Device (CCD) system, which reduced the probability of a misreading and achieved accurate real-time measurement of forest volume. Observers can choose an arbitrary location to position the electronic <b>angle</b> <b>gauge.</b> The survey time with the new method was half that of using a conventional <b>angle</b> <b>gauge</b> at five different observation locations. The forest volume measurement was automated using a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) with newly-designed software capable of identifying, registering and then counting the trees in a plot. This method improves accuracy of forest volume measurement and reduces the time and effort required previously...|$|R

40|$|Vehicle {{kinematics}} {{and optical}} parameters such as <b>optical</b> <b>angle,</b> <b>optical</b> expansion rate, and tau {{are thought to}} underlie drivers’ ability to avoid and handle critical traffic situations. Analyses of these parameters in naturalistic driving data with video, such as commercial event recordings of near-crashes and crashes, can provide insight into driver behavior in critical traffic situations. This paper describes a pair of methods, one for the range to a lead vehicle and one for its <b>optical</b> <b>angle,</b> that are derived from image processing mathematics and that provide driver behavior researchers with a relatively simple way to extract optical parameters from video-based naturalistic data when automatic image processing is not possible. The methods begin with manual measurements {{of the size of}} other road users on a video on a screen. To develop the methods, 20 participants manually measured the width of a lead vehicle on 14 images where the lead vehicle was placed at different distances from the camera. An on-market DriveCam Event Recorder was used to capture these images. A linear model that corrects distortion and modeling optics was developed to transform the on-screen measurements distance (range) to and <b>optical</b> <b>angle</b> of the vehicle. The width of the confidence interval for predicted range is less than 0. 1 m when the actual distance is less than 10 m and the lead-vehicle width estimate is correct. The methods enable driver behavior researchers to easily and accurately estimate useful kinematic and optical parameters from videos (e. g., of crashes and nearcrashes) in event-based naturalistic driving data...|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of <b>angle</b> metrology, <b>angle</b> <b>gauges</b> and polygons are the {{material}} artefact standards. Conventionally, autocollimator along with indexing table, are used for the calibration of <b>angle</b> <b>gauges</b> and polygons. A novel multiple reflections method is devised at NPLI to improve the uncertainty of measurements during calibrations. A polygon under calibration is fixed at the centre of a Moore’s indexing table within eccentricity offset ± 20 μm. A reference autocollimator is aligned {{to one of the}} face of the polygon. A flat reflector is fixed in the centre of a rotatable table. The rotatable table is arranged to collect the optical beam on to the flat reflector then deflected to same face of the polygon, wherefrom the light beam is received at the autocollimator. Thus the optical beam strikes the same face of the polygon twice. Therefore the resolution of the reference autocollimator is virtually doubled. In this experimental setup, two set of readings are obtained simultaneously. One set of the readings corresponds to conventional method and the second set of the readings belongs to the proposed novel method. The readings of the autocollimator are analysed and the results are discussed in the article. The results thus obtained by conventional method are compared with the results obtained using the proposed method. Using this novel calibration method, the uncertainty of measurement is improved from ± 0. 39 ″ to ± 0. 23 ″...|$|R
