5|$|Wellingborough {{experiences}} an <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate</b> (Köppen climate classification) {{which is}} similar to most of the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|An <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate</b> is {{typically}} found {{along the west}} coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, and in southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oceanic</b> <b>climates</b> are not {{necessarily}} always found in coastal locations on the aforementioned parallels; however, in most cases <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates</b> parallel higher middle latitude oceans. The polar jet stream, which moves in a west to east direction across the middle latitudes, advancing low pressure systems, storms, and fronts. In coastal areas of the higher middle latitudes (45-60° latitude), the prevailing onshore flow creates {{the basic structure of}} most <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates.</b> <b>Oceanic</b> <b>climates</b> are a product and reflection of the ocean adjacent to them. In the fall, winter, and early spring, when the polar jet stream is most active, the frequent passing of marine weather systems creates the frequent fog, cloudy skies, and light drizzle often associated with <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates.</b> In summer, high pressure often pushes the prevailing westerlies north of many <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates,</b> often creating a drier summer climate (for example in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada).|$|R
50|$|<b>Oceanic</b> <b>climates</b> {{can have}} much storm {{activity}} {{as they are}} located in the belt of the stormy westerlies. Many <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates</b> have frequent cloudy or overcast conditions due to the near constant storms and lows tracking over or near them. The annual range of temperatures is smaller than typical climates at these latitudes due to the constant stable marine air masses that pass through <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates,</b> which lack both very warm and very cool fronts.|$|R
50|$|All {{mid-latitude}} <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates</b> {{are classified}} as humid. However, some rainshadow climates feature thermal régimes {{similar to those of}} <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates</b> but with steppe-like (BSk) or even desert-like (BWk) scarcity of precipitation. Despite the oceanic-like thermal regimes, these areas are generally classified as steppe or desert climates. These arid versions of <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates</b> are found in eastern Washington and Oregon to the east of the Cascade Range in the United States, in the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia in Canada, Patagonia in southern Argentina, and the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.|$|R
5|$|Canterbury {{experiences}} an <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate</b> (Köppen climate classification Cfb), {{similar to}} {{almost all of}} the United Kingdom. Canterbury enjoys mild temperatures all year round, being between 1.8°C (35.2°F) and 22.8°C (73°F). There is relatively little rainfall throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the rest}} of United Kingdom and its parent county, Cheshire, Bradwall has an <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate</b> {{influenced}} by the Atlantic Ocean, and also by its altitude due to its proximity to the Pennines.|$|E
5|$|Northern England has a cool, wet <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate</b> {{with small}} areas of subpolar <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate</b> in the uplands. Averaged {{across the entire}} region, Northern England is cooler, wetter and cloudier than England as a whole, and {{contains}} both England's coldest point (Cross Fell) and its rainiest point (Seathwaite Fell). Its temperature range and sunshine duration {{is similar to the}} UK average and it sees substantially less rain than Scotland or Wales. These averages disguise considerable variation across the region, due chiefly to the upland regions and adjacent seas.|$|E
50|$|Precipitation is both {{adequate}} and reliable {{throughout the year}} in <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates.</b> Extended months of rain and cloudy conditions are common in <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates.</b> Seattle {{is an example of}} this. Between October and May, Seattle experiences high rainfall and is mostly or partly cloudy six out of every seven days.|$|R
50|$|It {{is grown}} {{in other areas}} with mild <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates</b> such as Scotland.|$|R
50|$|Outside the Mediterranean Basin, the Mediterranean {{climate is}} usually located {{geographically}} {{on the western}} coasts of continental masses, typically between <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates</b> towards the poles, and semi-arid and arid climates towards the Equator. In essence, a Mediterranean climate {{is a combination of}} the three climates with winters somewhat mimicking winters in <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates</b> and summers imitating dry seasons in semi-arid and arid climates. Additionally, Mediterranean climates tend to be wetter poleward and drier the closer it gets to the Equator.|$|R
5|$|The geology and {{geomorphology}} of {{the area}} is complex and the islands and the surrounding sea lochs each have distinctive features. The influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Atlantic Drift create a mild, damp <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Being {{surrounded}} by the sea in three directions, Skagen has a cool <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate</b> {{with a lack of}} temperature extremes. Its maritime and moderated characteristics is shared {{with the rest of the}} country. Skagen is Denmark's sunniest town with an average of 233 hours of sunshine in the holiday month of July, higher than the 222 hours recorded for Bornholm's Østerlars.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen {{is in the}} <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate</b> zone (Köppen: Cfb ). Its {{weather is}} subject to {{low-pressure}} systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate. While snowfall occurs mainly from late December to early March, there can also be rain, with average temperatures around the freezing point.|$|E
50|$|The park's {{variations}} in topography support plants from regions of Portugal with both Mediterranean and <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates.</b> Over 800 {{species of plants}} are found within the natural park.|$|R
5000|$|The humid {{subtropical}} climate zone predominantly lies in eastern Australia. The coastal strip from Mackay, Queensland {{to the southern}} coast of Sydney, where it grades into the cooler and wet <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Monterey cypress {{has been}} widely {{cultivated}} away from its native range, both elsewhere along the California coast, and in other areas with similar cool summer, mild winter <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates.</b> It is a popular private garden and public landscape tree in California.|$|R
5|$|Salta, {{like the}} rest of the Solway plain, has an <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate</b> (Köppen climate {{classification}} Cfb), with warm summers and cool winters which generally avoid extremes of temperature. Salta has a cool climate, with average daytime highs of around 19°C during July and 7°C during December, although lows of −12°C have been recorded. It is wet all year round, with rain or drizzle expected on 16 to 19 days of most months. Snowfall is relatively uncommon.|$|E
5|$|The archipelago's remote {{location}} and <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate</b> are matched in the UK {{only by a}} few smaller outlying islands such as the Flannan Isles, North Rona, Sula Sgeir, and the Bishop's Isles at {{the southern edge of}} the Outer Hebrides. Administratively, St Kilda was part of the parish of Harris in the traditional county of Inverness-shire. Today it is incorporated in the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles) unitary authority.|$|E
5|$|The island's lush vegetation, {{a product}} of its mild climate and {{frequent}} rainfall, earns it the sobriquet the Emerald Isle. Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate</b> with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is temperate avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas {{in the world at}} similar latitudes. This {{is a result of the}} moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the South-Western Atlantic.|$|E
50|$|It {{typically}} lacks a dry season, as precipitation is {{more evenly}} dispersed throughout the year. It is the predominant climate type {{across much of}} Western Europe, the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada, portions of central Mexico, southwestern South America, southeastern Australia including Tasmania, New Zealand as well as isolated locations elsewhere. <b>Oceanic</b> <b>climates</b> generally have cool summers and cool (but not cold) winters. They are characterised by a narrower annual range of temperatures than are encountered in other places at a comparable latitude, and generally {{do not have the}} extremely dry summers of Mediterranean climates or the hot summers of humid subtropical. <b>Oceanic</b> <b>climates</b> are most dominant in Europe, where they spread much farther inland than in other continents.|$|R
50|$|Lisieux has a {{temperate}} <b>oceanic</b> humid <b>climate.</b>|$|R
50|$|Chambéry {{is right}} on the {{boundary}} between the humid subtropical and <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates</b> under the Köppen system. In spite of this it is highly influenced by its interior position within France, resulting in quite hot summers and winters with frequent temperatures below freezing, especially at night.|$|R
5|$|The Köppen {{classification}} {{depends on}} average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The {{most commonly used}} form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical, humid continental, <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate,</b> Mediterranean climate, steppe, subarctic climate, tundra, polar ice cap, and desert.|$|E

5|$|The {{coastal areas}} {{bordering}} the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate</b> with warm to hot, moderately dry summers and cool to cold, wet winters. Snow {{falls on the}} coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in {{no more than a}} few days. However snow is rare in the coastal areas of the Aegean Sea and very rare in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{species from}} the <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates</b> of coastal Alaska, New Zealand, Tierra del Fuego and Tasmania are adapted to Faroe, while species {{from the more}} {{continental}} climates of Scandinavia and Europe do not show that virtue because of intolerance to {{the wind and the}} lack of summer heat.|$|R
50|$|This region’s climate {{corresponds}} with the <b>oceanic</b> low-mountain <b>climate.</b>|$|R
50|$|Andenes has {{a climate}} on the {{boundary}} between the subarctic and the subpolar <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates,</b> due to it being extremely mild for its latitude as a result of Gulf Stream influence. Summers are extremely cool due to the moderation, whereas even during the polar night period, daytime highs frequently rise above freezing.|$|R
5|$|P.acicularis is {{probably}} the most abundant species of the genus. Most specimens have been found on the west coast of North America as far north as Alaska, but it has been reported most frequently from British Columbia and Washington. The species is found in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and has also been reported from the Russian arctic. In general, P.acicularis seems to prefer an <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate</b> without extremely low temperatures, at least in comparison with other species of the genus. This assumption is supported by the fact that P.acicularis is found more southerly (34 findings in California) than all other species and is less frequently found in northern Alaska where, for example, P.robustus and P.vegae are more common. P.acicularis is rare east of the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Atlantic Current creates a mild <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate.</b> Temperatures are generally cool, averaging 6.5°C (44°F) in January and 15.4°C (60°F) in July at Duntulm on the Trotternish peninsula of Skye. Snow seldom lies at sea level and frosts are fewer than on the mainland. Winds are a limiting factor for vegetation: a speed of 128km/h (80mph) has been recorded; south-westerlies are the most common. Rainfall is generally high at between 1300 and 2000mm (50–80in) per annum, and the mountains and hills are wetter still. Tiree {{is one of the}} sunniest places in the country and had 300 days of sunshine in 1975. Trotternish typically has 200 hours of bright sunshine in May, the sunniest month.|$|E
5|$|Under the Köppen climate classification, Boston has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen Dfa or Dfb) that borders a humid subtropical climate or a temperate <b>oceanic</b> <b>climate</b> (Köppen Cfa or Cfb) with some maritime influence. Despite its climate, the city {{lies at the}} transition between USDA plant hardiness zones 6b (most of the city) and 7a (Downtown, South Boston, and East Boston neighborhoods). Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and humid, while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperatures. Spring and fall are usually mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize {{the influence of the}} Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
50|$|Dryopteris aemula is {{confined}} to the atlantic coastal areas of western Europe and Macaronesia. D. aemula is highly oceanic in its distribution occurring mostly in the Köppen <b>climate</b> type Cfb (<b>oceanic</b> <b>climates).</b> Even within Great Britain it is restricted to western districts and has just a few outlying eastern localities such as The Weald.|$|R
50|$|In some climate classifications, the {{temperate}} zone {{is often}} divided into several smaller climate zones, based on latitude. These include humid subtropical <b>climate,</b> Mediterranean <b>climate,</b> <b>oceanic,</b> and continental <b>climate.</b>|$|R
25|$|Berlin has a Maritime {{temperate}} climate (Cfb) {{according to the}} Köppen climate classification system. There are significant influences of mild continental climate due to its inland position, with frosts being common in winter and there being larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many <b>oceanic</b> <b>climates.</b> Furthermore, Berlin is classified as a temperate continental climate (Dc) under the Trewartha climate scheme.|$|R
