25|$|In {{coherent}} sheaf theory, {{pushing to}} the limit <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done with Serre duality without the assumption of a non-singular scheme, {{the need to take}} a whole complex of sheaves in place of a single dualizing sheaf became apparent. In fact the Cohen–Macaulay ring condition, a weakening of non-singularity, corresponds to the existence of a single dualizing sheaf; and this is far from the general case. From the top-down intellectual position, always assumed by Grothendieck, this signified a need to reformulate. With it came the idea that the 'real' tensor product and Hom functors would be those existing on the derived level; with respect to those, Tor and Ext become more like computational devices.|$|E

25|$|The {{significance}} of Bai Bureh's {{war against the}} British {{is not a matter}} of whether he won or lost the war but that a man who had none <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> called formal military training was able to show that for a significant number of months he was able to take on the British who were very proud of their great military successes across the globe. The British troops were led by officers trained at the finest military academies where war is studied in the same way that one studies a subject at university. The fact that Bai Bureh was not executed after his capture has led some historians to claim that this was in admiration for his prowess as an adversary to the British.|$|E
25|$|Mantetsu {{was also}} {{charged with a}} government-like role in {{managing}} the rail transportation system after the formation of Manchukuo in 1932. By 1938, Mantetsu had 72 subsidiary companies, development projects in 25 urban areas and carried 17,515,000 passengers per year. Between 1930-1940, the Japanese population of Manchukuo rose by 800,000 making ethnic Japanese the majority {{in many of the}} towns and cities served by Mantetsu. Mantetsu prided itself on state-of-the-art urban planning, with modern sewer systems, public parks, and creative modern architecture far in advance <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> found in Japan itself. These things were possible due to Mantetsu's tremendous profitability, and its political power to seize property and silence opposition and dissent at will through its political connections to the military and totalitarian national leadership.|$|E
25|$|Penthouse, {{started by}} Bob Guccione in England in 1965, took a {{different}} approach. Women looked indirectly at the camera, {{as if they were}} going about their private idylls. This change of emphasis was influential in erotic depictions of women. Penthouse was also the first magazine to publish pictures that included pubic hair and , both of which were considered beyond the bounds of the erotic and in the realm of pornography at the time. In the late 1960s, magazines began to move into more explicit displays often focusing on the buttocks as standards <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> legally depicted and what readers wanted to see changed. By the 1970s, they were focusing on the pubic area and eventually, by the 1990s, featured sexual penetration, lesbianism and homosexuality, group sex, masturbation, and fetishes in the more hard-core magazines such as Hustler.|$|E

25|$|The {{exhibition}} {{was an enormous}} success in that it served to catalyze anew designers, decorators, artists and architects in France, who prior to the 1910 Salon d'Automne had been lagging behind in the design sector. It also catalyzed public opinion, formerly interested solely in paintings. The fact that the viewers saw first hand, and many for the first time, {{what had been done}} abroad, opened up a potential <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done in the field of decorative arts at home. Jourdain had successfully staged the German show to provoke French designers into improving the quality of their own work. The effects would be felt in Paris, first with the 1912 exhibition of French decorative arts at the Pavillon de Marsan, then again at the Salon d'Automne of 1912, with La Maison Cubiste, the collaborative effort of the designer André Mare, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and other artists associated with the Section d'Or.|$|E
25|$|Presented {{with this}} quasi-paradoxical situation, Sarkar offers {{a concept of}} {{progress}} as a society that transcends material and technological development. Moving {{along the lines of}} the triple bottom line that analyzes the social, environmental and financial output of a given enterprise, PROUT advocates a measure of progress that encompasses the qualities <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> termed a „fourth bottom line“ , characterized by the incorporation of a transcendental dimension of human life that focuses on the integrated development of the body, mind and spirit. This fourth bottom line will allow society in general and individuals in particular to develop an expanded sense of identity, allowing for a neo-humanistic will of inclusion, creating a society where material gains are not the summum bonum of life and allowing space to be created for people to work together in a symbiotic movement that primes for individual and collective welfare through social, cultural, as well as technological development.|$|E
25|$|The Gulf of Tonkin {{incident}} of 2 August 1964 {{led to a}} dramatic increase in direct American participation in the war, with nearly 200,000 troops deployed {{by the end of the}} year. Viet Cong and PAVN strategy, organization and structure meant Westmoreland faced a dual threat. Regular North Vietnamese army units infiltrating across the remote border were apparently concentrating to mount an offensive and Westmoreland considered this the danger that had to be tackled immediately. There was also entrenched guerrilla subversion throughout the heavily populated coastal regions by the Viet Cong. Consistent with the enthusiasm of Robert McNamara for statistics, Westmoreland placed emphasis on body count and cited the Battle of Ia Drang as evidence the communists were losing. However, the government wished to win at low cost, and policymakers received McNamara's interpretation indicating huge American casualties in prospect, prompting a reassessment <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> achieved. Moreover, the Battle of Ia Drang was unusual in that US troops brought a large enemy formation to battle. After talking to junior officers General Johnson became skeptical about localised concentrated search and destroy sweeps of short duration, because the Communist forces controlled whether there were military engagements, giving an option to simply avoid battle with US forces if the situation warranted it. The alternative of sustained countrywide pacification operations, which would require massive use of US manpower, was never available to Westmoreland, because it was considered politically unacceptable.|$|E

500|$|This {{painting}} has a Ben-Day dots background {{with four}} layered vigorous brushstrokes atop them in white, yellow, green, and red. The focal {{point is the}} topmost central red brushstroke that depicts dripping paint. The black contours contribute a dynamic effect to the two-dimensional work. The subject of the painting {{is the process of}} Abstract Expressionist painting via sweeping brushstrokes and drips, but the result of Lichtenstein's simplification that uses a Ben-Day dots background is a representation of the mechanical/industrial color printing reproduction. [...] Big Painting No. 6 [...] is depicts imitations <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> typical Abstract Expressionist brushstrokes on an extremely large scale.

500|$|Initially {{struggling}} to find financial backing for Donnie Darko in Hollywood, director Richard Kelly spent {{a year and a}} half pitching the project to executives. After reading the script, Drew Barrymore agreed to finance the film through her production company Flower Films. Following Barrymore's involvement, Kelly was able to hire several well-known actors—such as Patrick Swayze, Mary McDonnell and Katharine Ross—and to produce the film for a budget of $4.5million. On January 19, 2001, Donnie Darko made its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. Despite the film receiving considerable acclaim from critics, distributors felt daunted and were unsure <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done with it.
