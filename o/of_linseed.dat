25|$|Many {{vegetable}} oils {{are used to}} make soaps, skin products, candles, perfumes and other personal care and cosmetic products. Some oils are particularly suitable as drying oils, and are used in making paints and other wood treatment products. Dammar oil (a mixture <b>of</b> <b>linseed</b> oil and dammar resin), for example, is used almost exclusively in treating the hulls of wooden boats. Vegetable oils are increasingly {{being used in the}} electrical industry as insulators as {{vegetable oils}} are not toxic to the environment, biodegradable if spilled and have high flash and fire points. However, vegetable oils are less stable chemically, so they are generally used in systems where they are not exposed to oxygen, and they are more expensive than crude oil distillate. Synthetic tetraesters, which are similar to vegetable oils but with four fatty acid chains compared to the normal three found in a natural ester, are manufactured by Fischer esterification. Tetraesters generally have high stability to oxidation and have found use as engine lubricants. Vegetable oil is being used to produce biodegradable hydraulic fluid and lubricant.|$|E

40|$|Linseeds {{are used}} in {{ruminant}} feeding for a long time, but this feedstuff knows now increasing interest. Linseeds are rich in alpha-linolenic acid, a fatty acid from the omega- 3 series. Despite an extensive biohydrogenation of dietary alpha-linolenic acid in the rumen, its concentration in milk and beef meat increases with linseed incorporation in diets; this increase is accompanied by that of other fatty acids produced during biohydrogenation, especially conjugated linoleic acids and trans 18 : 1 fatty acids. The increase in cow fertility due to omega- 3 fatty acids has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, linseed incorporation in ruminant diets {{is one of the}} most efficient ways to decrease enteric methane emissions. In addition to a global mitigating effect of all lipid sources on methane, linseeds have a specific effect due to changes in rumen microbial ecosystem. The practical use <b>of</b> <b>linseeds</b> in ruminant feeding at a large scale requires the absence of negative effect at any step of the ruminant production system. An excessive supply <b>of</b> lipids from <b>linseeds</b> can have deleterious effects on digestive efficiency, milk fat and protein content, beef susceptibility to oxidation, milk and beef fatty acid composition, but when linseed incorporation in the diet does not exceed ca. 3 % of additional fat, only positive effects are remaining. A challenge is the increase in linseed cropping to meet increased needs for animal feeding...|$|R
