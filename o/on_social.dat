40|$|Online social {{networks}} {{have become a}} seamless and critical online communication platform for personal interactions. They are a powerful tool that businesses are using to expand among domestic markets. The increase in participation in online social networking can and has caused damage to individuals and organizations, and the issuance of trust has become a concern <b>on</b> the <b>social</b> web. The factors determining the reputation of persons (customers) {{in the real world}} may relate to the factors of reputation <b>on</b> the <b>social</b> web, though relative to how trust is established in the physical world, establishing trust <b>on</b> the <b>social</b> web can be fairly difficult. Determining how to trust another individual’s online social profile becomes critical in initiating any interaction <b>on</b> the <b>social</b> web. Rather than focusing on content <b>on</b> the <b>social</b> network page, this research proposes and examines the application of user reputations to determine whether the trust should be issued <b>on</b> the <b>social</b> web. A top-level framework to establish trust in an identity <b>on</b> the <b>Social</b> Network Sites (SNS) {{as a function of the}} users’ associations, usage patterns and reputation <b>on</b> the <b>social</b> web is presented...|$|R
