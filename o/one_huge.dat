The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are {{club-shaped}} or elongated ellipses, up to 130–155µm in length. The pleurocystidia protrude from the face of the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development. C.micaceus may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are 60–100 by 5–10µm, but their presence is variable and cannot reliably be used for identification. Both De Bary and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of cytoplasm formed where numerous thin plates of cytoplasm meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes, but Buller thought that they were formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles, and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the vacuoles enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the cytoplasm may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with <b>one</b> <b>huge</b> vacuole occupying the cell center.|$|E

At this point he was pursued probably by three of the opponents, barely keeping up. This continued till he got opposite the further goal post, and then <b>one</b> <b>huge</b> foot was smartly dropped on the ball, stopping it dead, {{and of course the}} pursuers all ran a yard or so too far, not suspecting the sudden pull up; thus he had a clear shot at the goal.|$|E

25|$|While {{microscopy}} is {{a central}} tool in the documentation of biological specimens, it is, in general, insufficient to justify the description of a new species based on microscopic investigations alone. Often genetic and biochemical tests are necessary to confirm {{the discovery of a}} new species. A laboratory and access to academic literature is a necessity, which is specialized and, in general, not available to amateurs. There is, however, <b>one</b> <b>huge</b> advantage that amateurs have above professionals: time to explore their surroundings. Often, advanced amateurs team up with professionals to validate their findings and (possibly) describe new species.|$|E

In total, the three apartments sold for a combined $54.8 million.|$|E

In his Tōkyō Bay Project Tange spoke about the living body having two types of information transmission systems: fluid and electronic. That project used the idea of a tree trunk and branches that would carry out those types of transmission in relation to the city.

25|$|There was however <b>one</b> <b>huge</b> {{improvement}} {{created by}} Wyatt – the cloisters. This two-storeyed gallery {{which was built}} around all four sides of the inner courtyard, provided the house with not only the much needed corridors to link the rooms, but also a magnificent gallery to display the Pembroke collection of classical sculpture. Wyatt died before completion, but not before he and Lord Pembroke had quarrelled over the designs and building work. The final touches were executed by Wyatt's nephew Sir Jeffry Wyatville. Today nearly two hundred years later Wyatt's improvements do not jar the senses {{as much as they}} did those of the great architectural commentators James Lees-Milne and Sir Sacheverell Sitwell writing in the 1960s. That Wyatt's works are not in the same league of style as the south front, and the Tudor tower, is perhaps something for future generations to judge.|$|E
25|$|On Giorgione's {{premature}} death, Titian {{completed the}} painting {{and went on to}} paint a great many more naked women, most frequently, as Botticelli did, disguising them as goddesses and surrounding them with sylvan woods and starry skies to make perfect decoration for the walls of rich clientele. But it was as a painter of portraits that Titian excelled, his longevity allowing him to achieve far more, both in the way of production and in stylistic development than either Giorgione or his Florentine contemporary Raphael were able to. Titian gave the world images of Pietro Aretino and Pope Paul III and many other people of his day, perhaps his most powerful portrait being that of Doge Andrea Gritti, ruler of Venice, who looms large in the picture space, <b>one</b> <b>huge</b> hand clasping his heavily buttoned robe in a dynamic Expressionistic gesture. Titian is also renowned for his religious painting, his last work being a turbulent and abstracted Pietà.|$|E

500|$|Welles had {{originally}} wanted the entire film to use high contrast cinematography, resembling engravings of the Middle Ages; only the opening title sequence uses this technique. The film's most famous sequence is the Battle of Shrewsbury; only about 180 extras were available and Welles used editing techniques {{to give the}} appearance of armies of thousands. Welles filmed all of the battle scenes in long takes, but cut the shots into fragments to create the effect that he wanted. It took ten days to shoot the scenes and six weeks to edit what became a six-minute sequence. In filming the sequence, Welles often used hand-held cameras, wide-angle lenses, slow motion and speed up shots, static shots, swish pans and constant rapid movement of the characters to create a kinetic and chaotic atmosphere. Anderegg has said that [...] "in the end, both armies have become <b>one</b> <b>huge,</b> awkward, disintegrating war machine, a grotesque robot whose power source slowly begins to fail and finally comes to a frozen halt. Verbal rhetoric—language itself—seems, for the moment, both irrelevant and obscene." ...|$|E
500|$|On a {{slightly}} less positive note, Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode with a B+. He remarked that it [...] "starts out intense and crazy" [...] but [...] "becomes fairly predictable {{in its second}} half," [...] as he correctly predicted Walternate's involvement in the abduction. Murray concluded, [...] "Ultimately, 'Bloodline' {{is more of a}} plot-mover than most episodes of Fringe. There’s no additional case to solve, and no profound theme to explore. If anything, it’s like the writers decided to inject a serum into the belly of show and accelerate the story, to get Fauxlivia’s baby out and to get on to the next phase." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler also didn't find the birth storyline all that shocking [...] "since {{the number of people that}} had the power and knowledge to do this kind of thing was low." [...] Rating the episode 7.5/10, Isler added that [...] "the story could have used a bit more misdirection and a red herring or two to really keep us guessing, but that's a minor critique. Overall, Walternate's Machiavellian role in this story works, and the most important takeaway from this story is that it moved the overarching plot forward in <b>one</b> <b>huge</b> leap. Instead of waiting nine 'story' months for Fauxlivia's baby to pop out, we've already got the kid ready to fit into whatever plot twist the show runners have planned." ...|$|E

Mondale called her [...] "a remarkable woman and a dear human being... She was a pioneer in our country for justice for women and a more open society. She broke a lot of molds and it's a better country for what she did." [...] George H. W. Bush said, [...] "Though we were one-time political opponents, I am happy to say Gerry and I became friends in time – a friendship marked by respect and affection. I admired Gerry in many ways, {{not the least of which}} was the dignified and principled manner she blazed new trails for women in politics." [...] Palin paid tribute to her on Facebook, expressing gratitude for having been able to work with her the year before and saying, [...] "She broke <b>one</b> <b>huge</b> barrier and then went on to break many more. May her example of hard work and dedication to America continue to inspire all women."

500|$|As soon as {{the turret}} had been hit the captain had ordered Q {{magazine}} doors closed and the magazine flooded, the order passing to the Transmitting Station below the armoured deck where Stoker 1st Class William Yeo was entrusted with passing the order on. The magazine was consequently flooded and locked up within minutes of the hit. [...] However the cordite charges which had fallen down from gun house after the hit were not removed to safety, and there were still ready charges in the working chamber. [...] A large number of crewmen still remained in the shell room, magazine handing room and working chamber. [...] The fire which was {{thought to have been}} put out after the hit on the turret gained strength and ignited the remaining cordite charges, setting off a large explosion at 16:28 which killed the turret crewmen, the flame of the explosion reaching as high as the top of the ship's masts. [...] Even with the precautions taken in hand, the magazine doors were later found to be severely buckled – only the seawater in the magazine behind it prevented the blast reaching inside. Other ships of the battlecruiser fleet were less lucky; {{at about the same time}} as Harvey's death, [...] was torn to pieces by a series of magazine explosions that claimed 1,013 lives and just minutes after that HMS Queen Mary exploded [...] "like a puffball" [...] in <b>one</b> <b>huge</b> column of grey smoke, killing 1,275 sailors.

500|$|... "Nebraska" [...] {{was widely}} lauded by {{television}} commentators. Alex Strachan of the Ottawa Citizen {{felt that the}} episode was very poignant, adding that various scenes were [...] "beautifully acted". In his A– review, Verne Gay of Newsday opined that [...] "Nebraska" [...] accurately established the progression of a dark atmosphere {{for the second half}} of the season. Rawlings asserted that the episode gives the audience [...] "plenty to chew on", and that it nicely sets up a foundation for future storylines. The A.V. Club Zack Halden evoked similar sentiments; [...] "'Nebraska' doesn’t entirely rectify this concern, but it’s a solid hour of television, and a promising indication of where the series is headed." [...] Writing for IGN, Eric Goldman commended the installment's sense of direction; [...] "I liked how this episode thrust us right back into it, and the understandable misery everyone was going through. [...] It was a mixture of chaos, sadness and zombie killing—a mixture this show can do very well." [...] Concluding his review, Goldman issued [...] "Nebraska" [...] an eight out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. The Atlantic Scott Meslow iterated: [...] "'Nebraska' largely spends its first two acts reiterating things that happened earlier in the season, which in this case can somewhat be forgiven [...] But just when it looks as though the series will devote another episode to wheel-spinning, [...] "Nebraska" [...] surprises with a final act that serves as a reminder of why it's too soon to give up on The Walking Dead." [...] Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy noted that it successfully addressed the concerns of fans about the episodic pace, while also raising expectations for succeeding installments. Not all reviewers were enthusiastic about the episode as the general consensus. Boston Herald journalist Mark Perigard affirmed that [...] "Nebraska" [...] was inferior to its predecessor, ultimately giving it a C+ grade. Starlee Kine of New York wrote that it was [...] "just <b>one</b> <b>huge</b> whirlpool of pointless drama, pulling everything in its path under with it", while Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich thought that it was a setback from the previous episode.|$|E
