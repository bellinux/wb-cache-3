When the application grows in complexity, manual code development is not suitable, because it lacks in efficiency, reuse, reliability, maintainability, and group work facilities.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} popularity of semantic lexica such as wordnets {{that are being}} developed {{for more and more}} languages the need for tools which enable displaying and management of their content has risen as well. Dictionary writing systems or tools for ontology management are not suitable for use with wordnets because they are concept-based and relational on the one hand but less formal and more language-oriented on the other. Several specialized wordnet tools have been developed but it is still very difficult to find an all-in-one solution that would freely available and would enable <b>on-line</b> browsing, <b>editing</b> as well as visualization of wordnet content in a mono- as well as a multilingual setting.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} general {{methodology}} {{for protecting the}} confidentiality and integrity of user data for a class of <b>on-line</b> <b>editing</b> applications. The key insight {{is that many of}} these applications are designed to perform most of their data-dependent computation on the client side, so it is possible to maintain their functionality while only exposing an encrypted version of the document to the server. We apply our methodology to Google Documents and describe a prototype extension tool that enables users to use a cloud application to manage their documents without sacrificing confidentiality or integrity. To provide adequate performance, we employ an incremental encryption scheme and extend it to support variable-length blocks. We analyze the security of our scheme and report on experiments that show our extension preserves most of the cloud application’s functionality with less than 10 % overhead for typical use.

40|$|A common {{requirement}} to solve EM-based optimization problems consists of implementing numerical drivers to perform multiple calls to highly accurate commercial CAD tools, such as HFSS. Usually, this multiple {{calls to the}} tools cause a high consumption of computational resources and dedicated usage of licenses to manage the software. In environments such as academy and industry, sometimes {{it is not possible}} to have unlimited resources of these kind, being important to optimize the usage of them.

Our method consists of <b>on-line</b> <b>editing</b> the structure under study and collecting the EMresponses without ever opening or using the HFSS’s GUI. HFSS is especially suitable to this approach since it handles two separate licenses for its GUI and solving engine.

40|$|Abstract — Clustering {{algorithms}} aim at modeling fuzzy (i. e., ambiguous) unlabeled patterns efficiently. Our goal is {{to propose}} a theoretical framework where the expressive power of clustering systems can be compared {{on the basis of}} a meaningful set of common functional features. Part I of this paper reviews the following issues related to clustering approaches found in the literature: relative (probabilistic) and absolute (possibilistic) fuzzy membership functions and their relationships to the Bayes rule, batch and <b>on-line</b> learning, prototype <b>editing</b> schemes, growing and pruning networks, modular network architectures, topologically perfect mapping, ecological nets and neuro-fuzziness. From this discussion an equivalence between the concepts of fuzzy clustering and soft competitive learning in clustering algorithms is proposed as a unifying framework in the comparison of clustering systems. Moreover, a set of functional attributes is selected for use as dictionary entries in the comparison of clustering algorithms, which is the subject of Part II of this paper [1].

40|$|Authoring {{support for}} {{semantic}} annotations represent the wiki {{way of the}} Semantic Web, ultimately leading to the wiki version of the Semantic Web's eternal dilemma: why should authors correctly annotate their content? The obvious solution {{is to make the}} ratio between the needed effort and the acquired advantages as small as possible. Two are, at least, the specificities that set wikis apart from other Web-accessible content in this respect: social aspects (wikis are often the expression of a community) and technical issues (wikis are edited "on-line"). Being related to a community, wikis are intrinsically associated to the model of knowledge of that community, making the relation between wiki content and ontologies the result of a natural process. Being <b>edited</b> <b>on-line,</b> wikis can benefit from a synergy of Web technologies that support all the information sharing process, from authoring to delivery.
