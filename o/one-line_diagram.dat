5000|$|Schematic {{diagrams}} {{showing the}} electrical interconnections between the components are made. They may not show all the conductors and termination points. Except for <b>one-line</b> <b>diagrams,</b> this should show all the circuit nodes. <b>One-line</b> <b>diagrams</b> represent {{the three or}} four conductors of three-phase power circuits with one line.|$|R

It supports PCB layout programs with several netlist formats and can also produce SPICE simulation netlists. It is also often used to draw <b>one-line</b> <b>diagrams,</b> block diagrams, and presentation drawings.|$|R
50|$|A {{secondary}} {{advantage to}} using a <b>one-line</b> <b>diagram</b> {{is that the}} simpler diagram leaves more space for non-electrical, such as economic, information to be included.|$|E
5000|$|In power engineering, a <b>one-line</b> <b>diagram</b> or {{single-line}} diagram (SLD) is {{a simplified}} notation for representing a three-phase power system. [...] The <b>one-line</b> <b>diagram</b> has its largest application in power flow studies. Electrical {{elements such as}} circuit breakers, transformers, capacitors, bus bars, and conductors are shown by standardized schematic symbols. Instead of representing each of three phases with a separate line or terminal, only one conductor is represented. It {{is a form of}} block diagram graphically depicting the paths for power flow between entities of the system. Elements on the diagram do not represent the physical size or location of the electrical equipment, but it is a common convention to organize the diagram with the same left-to-right, top-to-bottom sequence as the switchgear or other apparatus represented. A <b>one-line</b> <b>diagram</b> {{can also be used to}} show a high level view of conduit runs for a PLC control system.|$|E

50|$|For {{simplicity}} on <b>one-line</b> <b>diagrams,</b> {{the protection}} function is usually identified by an ANSI device number. In {{the era of}} electromechanical and solid state relays, any one relay could implement {{only one or two}} protective functions, so a complete protection system may have many relays on its panel. In a digital/numeric relay, many functions are implemented by the microprocessor programming. Any one numeric relay may implement one or all of these functions.|$|R

5000|$|An energy {{management}} system (EMS): {{a computer system}} for controlling a power grid. The EMS enables remote operation of electrical equipment, such as circuit breakers or transformers. It also receives information transmitted back to an electricity control centre, such as the status of equipment or notification of alarms. The user interface typically displays {{the state of the}} transmission system on computerised <b>one-line</b> <b>diagrams</b> with controllable points for simulated operation of plant such as circuit breakers or transformer tap-changers.|$|R

50|$|By {{expanding}} a <b>one-line</b> <b>diagram</b> to {{show the}} positive sequence, negative sequence and zero sequence impedances of generators, transformers and other devices including overhead lines and cables, analysis of such unbalanced conditions as a single line to ground short-circuit fault is greatly simplified. The technique can also be extended to higher order phase systems.|$|E

The results indicate that compared to standard 2 D one-line displays, 3 D visualizations of generator output and reserves can be used successfully on one-line displays to improve both the speed and accuracy of certain tasks...|$|R
50|$|When {{using the}} method of {{symmetrical}} components, separate <b>one-line</b> <b>diagrams</b> are made {{for each of the}} positive, negative and zero-sequence systems. This simplifies the analysis of unbalanced conditions of a polyphase system. Items that have different impedances for the different phase sequences are identified on the diagrams. For example, in general a generator will have different positive and negative sequence impedance, and certain transformer winding connections block zero-sequence currents. The unbalanced system can be resolved into three single line diagrams for each sequence, and interconnected to show how the unbalanced components add in each part of the system.|$|R

50|$|In {{electric}} power systems design, a schematic drawing called a <b>one-line</b> <b>diagram</b> is frequently {{used to represent}} substations, distribution systems or even whole electrical power grids. These diagrams simplify and compress the details that would be repeated on each phase of a three-phase system, showing only one element instead of three. Electrical diagrams for switchgear often have common device functions designate by standard function numbers.|$|E
50|$|In power engineering, the power-flow study, or {{load-flow}} study, is {{a numerical}} {{analysis of the}} flow of electric power in an interconnected system. A power-flow study usually uses simplified notations such as a <b>one-line</b> <b>diagram</b> and per-unit system, and focuses on various aspects of AC power parameters, such as voltages, voltage angles, real power and reactive power. It analyzes the power systems in normal steady-state operation.|$|E
50|$|An {{asymmetric}} fault {{breaks the}} underlying assumptions used in three-phase power, namely that the load is balanced {{on all three}} phases. Consequently, {{it is impossible to}} directly use tools such as the <b>one-line</b> <b>diagram,</b> where only one phase is considered. However, due to the linearity of power systems, it is usual to consider the resulting voltages and currents as a superposition of symmetrical components, to which three-phase analysis can be applied.|$|E
50|$|A gyrator is {{an entirely}} non-reciprocal device, and hence is {{represented}} by antisymmetric impedance and admittance matrices:If the gyration resistance is chosen to be equal to the characteristic impedance of the two ports (or to their geometric mean if {{these are not the}} same), then the scattering matrix for the gyrator iswhich is likewise antisymmetric. This leads to an alternative definition of a gyrator: a device which transmits a signal unchanged in the forward (arrow) direction, but reverses the polarity of the signal travelling in the backward direction (or equivalently, 180° phase-shifts the backward travelling signal). The symbol used to represent a gyrator in <b>one-line</b> <b>diagrams</b> (where a waveguide or transmission line is shown as a single line rather than as a pair of conductors), reflects this one-way phase shift.|$|R

40|$|An novel {{method of}} {{generating}} <b>one-line</b> <b>diagrams</b> of radial distribution {{systems in the}} form of a visibility graph is proposed. An algorithm that automatically generates an aesthetically 'pleasing' and 'readable' visibility diagram is presented. In addition to the basic property of a visibility graph that nodes and edges be represented by axis-parallel horizontal and vertical lines, respectively, a new set of layout specifications (aesthetic criteria) suitable for easy visualization of the distribution system have been proposed. This work is based on the premise that, in general, the network data of distribution systems does not contain any geographical information of node locations. Therefore the algorithm assumes that only the identity of the terminal nodes of all the edges are known. The proposed algorithm automatically determines node positions such that the specified aesthetic criteria are satisfied...|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} in {{planning}} a substation layout is the preparation of a <b>one-line</b> <b>diagram,</b> which shows in simplified form the switching and protection arrangement required, {{as well as the}} incoming supply lines and outgoing feeders or transmission lines. It is a usual practice by many electrical utilities to prepare one-line diagrams with principal elements (lines, switches, circuit breakers, transformers) arranged on the page similarly to the way the apparatus would be laid out in the actual station.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{analysis}} of a three-phase system is simplified by assuming balanced loading of all three phases. Steady-state operation is assumed, with no transient changes in power flow or voltage due to load or generation changes. The system frequency is also assumed to be constant. A further simplification {{is to use the}} per-unit system to represent all voltages, power flows, and impedances, scaling the actual target system values to some convenient base. A system <b>one-line</b> <b>diagram</b> is the basis to build a mathematical model of the generators, loads, buses, and transmission lines of the system, and their electrical impedances and ratings.|$|E
30|$|For easy {{maintenance}} and support, {{it is also}} preferred to leverage existing one-line diagrams from users’ current EMS. The system provides the capability to import one-line diagrams through the <b>one-line</b> <b>diagram</b> editor. User can also create, edit and update <b>one-line</b> <b>diagram</b> files, as well as map both PMU measurements and LSE estimated results on the electrical components in the <b>one-line</b> <b>diagram.</b> User can define dynamic behaviors to power system shapes of the <b>one-line</b> <b>diagram</b> by setting logic conditions. For instance, change of color on change of value, change of shape on change of value thresholds. <b>One-line</b> <b>diagram</b> information is stored in a database for providing centralized access for all visualization clients using ISG. These diagrams are stored by using versions for backward compatibility and change management.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In the {{operation}} of a power plant, the operator {{has to deal with}} a number of variables displayed in several windows, presented in different formats such as tabular, <b>one-line</b> <b>diagrams,</b> process diagrams, etc. Under these conditions, the operator needs to locate data relevant to the current status of the plant and efficiently navigate a large number of screens within the user interface. This situation becomes critical for infrequent tasks within the plant such as the start-up, shut-down or for abnormal operational conditions. In order to deal with the above situations, we propose a personalization mechanism based on models for adapting contents in a user interfaces for {{the operation}} of power plants. The model takes advantage of the integration of specific sub-models from artificial intelligence, user modeling and human-computer interaction. A personalization approach is applied into a...|$|R

40|$|New {{power system}} {{displays}} {{have been developed}} to aid operators in the detection and diagnosis of faults. The enhancement of integrated <b>one-line</b> <b>diagrams</b> of power system data with motion and motion cues was examined in this experiment. Participants acknowledged and solved power system failures on a simulated power network across a number of trials of varying complexity. Participants performed these tasks using interactive displays indicating power flow with digits, stationary arrows, or moving arrows. For high complexity scenarios, results indicated a general advantage for the motion display in the diagnostic task (problem resolution) but a slight advantage of the digital display on the fault detection task (problem identification). Performance with the stationary arrow display was generally between the other two groups, being nearly as good as with the digital display in the detection task and nearly as good as with the moving arrow display in the diagnosis task. Further research is necessary to determine the conditions where motion is most beneficial...|$|R

40|$|This senior project {{focuses on}} the {{simulation}} of the Cal Poly – Poly Canyon Cogeneration facility using SKM. The purpose of this project is to model the cogeneration system in the SKM software so theoretical calculations and analysis can be executed. This required an ample amount of research of the facility, collecting data about the cogeneration facility, a deep understanding of <b>one-line</b> <b>diagrams,</b> and efficiently learning the SKM software to produce an adequate model of the system. The data was obtained and examined from the Cal Poly facility offices. The cogeneration facility was simulated with a power systems analysis program called SKM, which was provided by a lab room in the electrical engineering building. The analysis performed on the overall system included a load flow study, a fault analysis, and an arc flash evaluation. With {{the results of the}} SKM software, the engineers working in the facility department can use this data for future improvements to the system. Improvements that could be made include adding protective devices at areas that are susceptible to faults, figuring out future power flow conditions, and using arc flash data to make the system safer. After project completion, I learned about power system design and protection in the fundamental form. I also learned how to isolate faults using protection devices.
