5|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> of the {{epidermis}} (outer skin) consists of: sensory cells; {{cells that}} secrete mucus, which protects the body; and interstitial cells, which can transform into {{other types of}} cell. In specialized {{parts of the body}} the <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> also contains colloblasts, found along the surface of tentacles and used in capturing prey, or cells bearing multiple large cilia, for locomotion. The inner layer of the epidermis contains a nerve net, and myoepithelial cells that act as muscles.|$|E
5|$|The {{shedding}} {{of scales}} is called ecdysis, or, in normal usage moulting or sloughing. In {{the case of}} snakes, the complete <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> of skin is shed in one layer. Snake scales are not discrete but extensions of the epidermis hence they are not shed separately, but are ejected as a complete contiguous <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> of skin during each moult, akin to a sock being turned inside out.|$|E

5|$|The insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, {{is made up}} of two layers: the epicuticle, {{which is}} a thin and waxy water {{resistant}} <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> and contains no chitin, and a lower layer called the procuticle. The procuticle is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers: an <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> known as the exocuticle and an inner layer known as the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and hardened. The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects (e.g., caterpillars), especially during their larval stages.|$|E

5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe the corona (the <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona. According to the point reached in the solar cycle, the corona may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. It is very hard to predict this in advance.|$|E
5|$|Galloways have a thick {{double-layered}} {{coat that}} is wavy or curly. This thick coat of hair insulates their bodies {{so well that}} they have a minimal <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> of fat on their bodies, which would otherwise create waste at slaughter. This coat sheds out in the summer months and in warmer climates. Despite the animal's usual use in beef production, there is evidence of Galloway herds being milked in Cumberland for cheese production.|$|E
50|$|The primary star {{is thought}} to be a post-AGB star, a highly evolved star that has ceased fusion and is {{ejecting}} its <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> {{on its way to becoming}} a white dwarf. Although many post-AGB stars become planetary nebulae once they become hot enough to ionise their ejected <b>outer</b> <b>layers,</b> it is thought that IRAS 08544-4431 is not massive enough to do this.|$|R

5|$|Most Hippeastrum bulbs are {{tunicate}} (a protective dry <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> and fleshy concentric inner scales or leaf bases). The bulbs {{are generally}} between 512cm (2"5") {{in diameter and}} produce two to seven long-lasting evergreen or deciduous leaves that are 3090cm (12"36") long and 2.55cm (1"2") wide. The leaves are hysteranthous (develop after flowering), sessile, rarely persistent and subpetiolate.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{growth is}} the {{elongation}} of the stems and roots. Secondary growth {{consists of a}} progressive thickening and strengthening of the tissues as the <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> of the epidermis is converted into bark and the cambium layer creates new phloem and xylem cells. The bark is inelastic. Eventually {{the growth of a}} tree slows down and stops and it gets no taller. If damage occurs the tree may in time become hollow.|$|E
5|$|The element, {{like other}} lanthanides, has no {{biological}} role. Promethium-147 can emit X-rays during its beta decay, which are dangerous for all lifeforms. Interactions with tiny quantities of promethium-147 are not hazardous if certain precautions are observed. In general, gloves, footwear covers, safety glasses, and an <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> of easily removed protective clothing should be used.|$|E
50|$|All {{nuclear fusion}} {{reactions}} that produce heavier elements cause the star to lose energy and {{are said to}} be endothermic reactions. The pressure that supports the star's <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> drops sharply. As the outer envelope is no longer sufficiently supported by the radiation pressure, the star's gravity pulls its <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> rapidly inward. As the star collapses, these <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> collide with the incompressible stellar core, producing a shockwave that expands outward through the unfused material of the outer shell. The pressures and densities in the shockwave are sufficient to induce fusion in that material, and the energy released leads to the star's explosion, dispersing material from the star into interstellar space.|$|R

50|$|A {{third option}} {{is that a}} giant star passes {{close enough to the}} central massive black hole for the <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> to be {{stripped}} away by tidal forces, after which the remaining core may become an EMRI. However, it is uncertain if the coupling between the core and <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> of giant stars is strong enough for stripping to have a significant enough effect on the orbit of the core.|$|R
5|$|The thyroid sits {{near the}} front of the neck, lying against and around the front of the larynx and trachea. The thyroid {{cartilage}} and cricoid cartilage lie just above the gland, below the Adam's apple. The isthmus extends from the second to third rings of the trachea, with the uppermost part of the lobes extending to the thyroid cartilage, and the lowermost around the fourth to sixth tracheal rings. The thyroid gland is covered by a thin fibrous capsule, which has an inner and an <b>outer</b> <b>layer.</b> The <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> is continuous with the pretracheal fascia, attaching the gland to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, via a thickening of the fascia to form the posterior suspensory ligament of thyroid gland also known as Berry's ligament. This causes the thyroid to move up and down with swallowing. The inner layer extrudes into the gland and forms the septae that divides the thyroid tissue into microscopic lobules. Typically four parathyroid glands, two on each side, lie on each side between the two layers of the capsule, {{at the back of the}} thyroid lobes.|$|E
5|$|A few species release fertilized {{eggs into}} the water, but most retain the eggs until they hatch. There are {{four types of}} larvae, but all are balls of cells with an <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> of cells whose flagellae or cilia enable the larvae to move. After {{swimming}} {{for a few days}} the larvae sink and crawl until they find a place to settle. Most of the cells transform into archeocytes and then into the types appropriate for their locations in a miniature adult sponge.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E
40|$|Rotavirus {{antisera}} {{with and}} without neutralizing activity to calf rotavirus were compared {{for their ability to}} agglutinate calf rotavirus particles {{with and without}} an <b>outer</b> capsid <b>layer.</b> Particles without the <b>outer</b> capsid <b>layer</b> were agglutinated by antisera with immunofluorescent antibody activity and by antisera with immunofluorescent antibody and neutralizing activity. Particles with the <b>outer</b> capsid <b>layer</b> were agglutinated only by antisera with neutralizing activity. The neutralization test appears to be type specific, and it was concluded that type-specific antigens are associated with the <b>outer</b> capsid <b>layer</b> of rotaviruses. Since particles with the <b>outer</b> capsid <b>layer</b> were not agglutinated by antisera lacking neutralizing activity but possessing immunofluorescent antibody activity, it was concluded that in intact particles the group-specific antigen is masked by the <b>outer</b> capsid <b>layer...</b>|$|R
50|$|Researchers {{produced}} an artificial tooth whose microstructure mimicked {{that of a}} real tooth. The <b>outer</b> <b>layers,</b> corresponding to enamel, were hard and structurally complex. The <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> contained glass nanoparticles and aluminium oxide plates were aligned perpendicular to the surface. After the <b>outer</b> <b>layers</b> hardened, a second suspension was poured. It contained no glass, and the plates were aligned horizontally {{to the surface of}} the tooth. These deeper layers were tougher, resembling dentine. The tooth was then cooked at 1,600 degrees to compact and harden the material — a process known as sintering. The last step involved filling remaining pores with a synthetic monomer used in dentistry, which polymerizes after treatment. Hardness and durability approximated that of both the enamel and dentine of a tooth.|$|R

5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series of {{developmental}} stages known as instars. Near the end of each stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During this phase, the cuticle, a tough <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.|$|E
5|$|Earth is {{estimated}} to have formed 4.54billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets. The moon formed roughly 20million years later. Initially molten, the <b>outer</b> <b>layer</b> of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, {{most or all of}} which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources. The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|More {{representatives of}} the genus are present in Asia. At least nine species have been {{recorded}} from mainland India, some of which also overlap C.cinnabarinums range in Indonesia, Taiwan, or Japan. Many of these species can be readily distinguished by macroscopic features. C.japonicum is pinkish orange and lacks a gelatinous <b>outer</b> <b>layer,</b> while both C.jiangii and C.junghuhnii are brown. However, others require microscopic features of spore shape and ornamentation for identification. Unlike the uniformly elongated spores of C.cinnabarinum, C.guizhouense possesses both elliptical and globose spores. C.pengii differs primarily {{in the pattern of}} ornamentation on its spore surface.|$|E
