5|$|In November 1988, B-1B (s/n 85-0076) {{from the}} 28th Bomb Wing, 37th Bomb Squadron, Ellsworth AFB crashed short <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> at Ellsworth AFB during adverse weather. All four crew members ejected successfully.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was assigned the airport's runway 22 for the takeoff, but used runway 26 instead. Runway 26 {{was too short}} for a safe takeoff, causing the aircraft to overrun the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> before it could become airborne. It crashed just past the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway,</b> killing all 47 passengers {{and two of the}} three crew. The flight's first officer was the only survivor.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1973. The airport {{needed to be}} built on permafrost. The runway is {{insulated}} against the ground, so it will not melt during the summer. The hangar is frozen into the ground, with the pillars being melted into place and then being frozen stuck. The runway was plagued with frost heave due to an incorrect construction method, forcing the airport to regularly re-asphalt the runway. In 1989, parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> were re-insulated, giving these areas that previously had been the worst an acceptable solution. In 2006, this measure {{was conducted on the}} remaining parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> An upgrade to the terminal building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Bits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runways</b> {{still exist}} {{and the site}} is now used for farming.|$|R
50|$|Flights into or out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{airfield}} apparently {{continued to}} at least 1989, but <b>the</b> <b>runways</b> existed into <b>the</b> 2000s (decade) (see the Google maps link for an excellent satellite image <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runways</b> apparently being torn up).|$|R
25|$|Also, in {{traditionally}} hot summers, strong easterly winds travelling {{across the}} scarp have presented serious issues for planes using the Perth Airport because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runways.</b>|$|R
5|$|Japan Airlines Flight 350, a DC-8, {{crashed in}} 1982 short <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> in Tokyo, after {{the mentally ill}} captain {{attempted}} suicide during the final approach phase of the flight, by putting the inboard engines into reverse thrust. Of the 174 people aboard, 24 died.|$|E
5|$|On 20 March 2009, Emirates Airline Flight 407, an Airbus A340-500, {{was taking}} off from Melbourne Airport on Runway 16 for a flight to Dubai International Airport and failed to become {{airborne}} in the normal distance. When the aircraft was nearing the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway,</b> the crew commanded nose-up sharply, causing its tail to scrape along the runway as it became airborne, during which smoke was observed in the cabin. The crew dumped fuel {{and returned to the}} airport. The damage caused to the aircraft was considered substantial. The aircraft damaged a strobe light at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> as well as an antenna on the localiser, which led to the ILS being out of service for some time causing some disruptions to the airport's operation.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1958, a B-47B Stratojet crashed {{while taking}} off from Loring, killing all four crewmembers on board. The plane belonged to a unit at McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando, Florida. The plane was {{described}} as having reached {{two-thirds of the way}} down the runway, when it veered sharply to the right, eventually crashing 400 feet north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> On 25 November 1958, a KC-135 Stratotanker of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron crashed on takeoff roughly in the same area as the B-47 three days before. Two crewmembers were thrown to safety by the impact of the crash. The Air Force stated that after a four-hour mission, the crewmembers were practicing taking off and landing on the runway. On 18 November 1960, a KC-135 crashed upon landing at Loring, killing one and injuring sixteen others. The plane landed after a six-and-a-half-hour training mission, veered off to the left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway,</b> and skidded three thousand feet while on fire. Surviving crewmembers were able to use the emergency chutes to evacuate the plane safely. On 9 May 1962, six crewmembers of a KC-135 were killed when their plane crashed during takeoff into a surrounding marsh, about fifteen hundred feet north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> On 4 January 1965, four crewmembers were killed three miles north of Loring when their KC-135 crashed into the ground after takeoff. On 5 September 1969, a B-52 Stratofortress crashed approximately three miles north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> after taking off. Seven men were killed, including six crewmembers, during a Minimum Interval Takeoff drill. On 4 October 1989 a KC-135 crash killed all 4 crewmembers. The jet, which crashed about 2.4 miles off the TransCanada Highway in New Brunswick, was attempting to land at Loring.|$|E
30|$|Runway {{consists}} of runway identifier, priority and its state. <b>The</b> set <b>of</b> <b>runways</b> {{is defined by}} a mapping from runway identifier to <b>Runway.</b> In <b>the</b> invariants, it is stated that an identifier element in <b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runways</b> mapping is in <b>the</b> <b>Runway</b> data type.|$|R
500|$|Pilots {{have called}} Congonhas airport the [...] "aircraft carrier," [...] because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway's</b> short length and because pilots {{are told to}} {{go-around}} if they overshoot <b>the</b> first [...] <b>of</b> <b>runway.</b>|$|R
2500|$|For {{the first}} time ever, Mumbai's {{airports}} ( [...] Chatrapati Shivaji International Airport and Juhu aerodrome) were shut for more than 30 hours due to heavy flooding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runways,</b> submerged Instrument Landing System equipment and extremely poor visibility. Over 700 flights were cancelled or delayed. The airports reopened on <b>the</b> morning <b>of</b> 28 July 2005. Within 24 hours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airports becoming operational, there were 185 departures and 184 arrivals, including international flights. Again from early morning of 31 July, with increase in water logging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runways</b> and different parts of Mumbai, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flights were indefinitely cancelled.|$|R
5|$|Some locals {{wanted to}} keep Fornebu as a {{regional}} airport for the Oslo and BÃ¦rum area. The proposal was to keep part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> and terminals and allow aircraft such as the Bombardier Dash 8, Fokker 50 and British Aerospace 146 to use the airport. Proponents argued that a similar role was filled by Stockholm-Bromma Airport and Chicago's Midway Airport.|$|E
5|$|Thompson's company dug {{in at the}} end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> nearest OP 1 with XO Peter Everts' platoon {{overlooking}} the deep ravine where caves kept the NVA from harm due to B-52 strikes called in on their location.|$|E
5|$|In August 1996, a Spanish Learjet {{operated}} by Mar Aviation overshot runway 25 and {{collided with a}} van heading eastward on the A40 Western Avenue; the aircraft was carrying an actress bound for Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. The two pilots, the actress and van driver all suffered minor injuries. The ensuing investigation by the Civil Aviation Authority's Air Accidents Investigation Branch found that both the crew's lack of understanding English and military air traffic control procedures had {{contributed significantly to the}} crash. Subsequently, after some thirty years of protracted consideration, an ILS was eventually fitted to Northolt's redefined Runway 25. In addition, aggregate-filled safety pits were installed at each end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> by 21 January 1998 to protect road users in the event of another business jet or military transport failing to stop or ascend before the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> The House of Commons Transport Select Committee considered the conversion of RAF Northolt to a possible offshoot of Heathrow Airport in the 1990s. While the existing runways would cause aircraft to cross the flightpaths of those using Heathrow, new parallel runways were suggested. These suggestions were opposed by then MP for Ruislip-Northwood, John Wilkinson, and eventually progressed no further.|$|E
50|$|Donald Trump sued {{to block}} <b>the</b> {{expansion}} <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runways</b> at PBIA in 2010. In 2015 he initiated a lawsuit over the flight path that passes over his Mar-a-Lago estate.|$|R

25|$|The {{two main}} hangars at Seighford were built {{adjacent}} to the airfield but across the B5405 road, which ran along <b>the</b> northern edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runways.</b> This necessitated closing the road to transport aircraft between the hangars and <b>the</b> <b>runways.</b> This procedure carried on into the Boulton Paul era too.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the positions of the}} thrust levers, the report points to several factors that {{may have contributed to the}} accident, such as a high volume of rain on the day, with the formation of puddles on the runway, as well as the absence of grooving. The report does not blame the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> for the accident. The BEA also cleared Airbus of any misdoing because they had proposed a system warning modification regarding the incorrect thrust lever positions which TAM had rejected.|$|E
5|$|On 30 September 1977, an Interconair Britannia 253G {{was on a}} ferry flight, on {{approach}} to Shannon Airport severe vibration was experienced at a height of 300 feet. The {{approach to}} runway 24 was abandoned and an overshoot was commenced. The aircraft continued to sink and collided with the ground short {{and to the right}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> The Britannia aircraft bounced, the right wing broke off. The aircraft then skidded and caught fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{arrived at}} John F. Kennedy International Airport at around 4:00 pm EDT and taxied {{to a remote}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> A three-man hostage negotiation team had been assembled in the air traffic control tower. NYPD detective Dominick Misino spoke with Demeke over the radio, assisted by FBI special agent John Flood and Port Authority detective sergeant Carmine Spano. After 70 minutes of negotiation, Demeke traded his pistol for the pilot's sunglasses and surrendered peacefully to authorities. All 94 passengers and ten crew were unharmed.|$|E
50|$|At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War the {{airfield}} fell into disuse, and Google Earth high-resolution imagery shows {{the airfield}} {{to be in}} poor condition. <b>The</b> outline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runways</b> and tarmac is still visible from satellite imagery.|$|R
50|$|After the war ended, {{the airport}} was closed {{sometime}} in 1945 or 1946. It remains abandoned to this day, the land being {{owned by the}} Flagship Harbor Preserve. <b>The</b> outlines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runways</b> are clearly delineated in aerial imagery.|$|R
50|$|HB 876 mine: 1970s-1999. An air dropped mine used as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> JP233 <b>runway</b> attacking system. Each {{attack with}} a JP233 also dropped 215 HB 876s that were {{intended}} to make repair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damaged <b>runway</b> slow and dangerous.|$|R
5|$|The general concept pre-dated the Mk. IV and was {{essentially}} a UK version of the German Lorenz beam system. Lorenz, or Standard Beam Approach as it was known in the UK, used a single transmitter located off {{the far end of}} the active runway that was alternately connected to one of two slightly directional antennas using a motorized switch. The antennas were aimed so they sent their signals to the left and right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway,</b> but their signals overlapped down the centreline. The switch spent 0.2seconds connected to the left antenna (as seen from the aircraft) and then 1second on the right.|$|E
5|$|Andreas Hjelmeland {{established}} FÃ¸rdefly in 1966 as {{the second}} airline based in Sogn og Fjordane. FÃ¸rdefly never received a concession to operate scheduled services; instead it flew a daily charter flight to Bergen Airport. The airline established a water aerodrome at Ãyrane {{at the mouth of}} the river JÃ¸lstra. The aerodrome had a passenger and freight terminal, a quay, a hangar and a control tower. The municipality received permission from the Ministry of Transport and Communications in mid 1970 to operate a municipal airport, and chose to use the terminal facilities operated by FÃ¸rdefly. Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> cost 1.3 million Norwegian krone and the first aircraft landed on the strip on 14 July 1970. Scheduled services commenced on 1 July 1971, the same day as FlorÃ¸ Airport, Sogndal Airport, HaukÃ¥sen and Ãrsta-Volda Airport, Hovden opened.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Thunderbird 2, Virgil deploys three Elevator Cars, two {{of which}} will be {{remote-controlled}} from his master vehicle. Fireflash will be guided into a controlled landing on top of the cars, touching down with its undercarriage raised. Virgil and the Elevator Cars rush to intercept the inbound Fireflash on Runway 29, but when one of the remote-controlled cars malfunctions and crashes into a Boeing 727, which explodes twice on impact, the rescue attempt is aborted and the operation suspended while Virgil activates a reserve car. Fireflash starts a second run and successfully makes contact with all three vehicles. Applying brakes, Virgil loses control of the master car, which crashes into a trench; he is uninjured, however, and Fireflash comes to a halt before reaching the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> The bomb is dislodged from its original position but ultimately fails to explode.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 1960s the civil {{activities}} moved on <b>the</b> east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> property {{and an old}} hangar {{was used as a}} passenger terminal. In 1971 the first passenger terminal was built. In <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> was lengthened to the current 3000 meters, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longest <b>runways</b> in Italy and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> safest.|$|R
50|$|GdaÅsk Lech WaÅÄsa Airport has {{a single}} asphalt-concrete <b>runway</b> in <b>the</b> {{direction}} <b>of</b> 11/29. <b>The</b> <b>runway</b> is 2800 m long and it {{is equipped with a}} modern ILS CAT II allowing aircraft to land in foggy weather. The decision height established for the approach system in GdaÅsk is 30 m, whereas the visibility minimum for pilots varies from 125 m to 300 m, the higher value being required in <b>the</b> initial one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway's</b> length. In addition, the navigation facilities at the airport are supplemented with a modern wide area multilateration system.|$|R

5|$|In November 1945 it {{returned}} with the 509th Composite Group to Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico, where it remained {{for the rest of}} its flying career, except for a brief period when it was assigned to Task Force 1.5 for Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in July 1946. It returned to the 509th, now designated the 509th Bombardment Group, in September. On 3 September 1948, during a polar navigation training mission, it developed an engine problem after takeoff from Goose Bay Air Base, Labrador, and ran off the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> when attempting to land. Heavily damaged, it never flew again, and was eventually scrapped at Goose Bay in September 1949, despite its historical significance.|$|E
5|$|M-80 {{starts at}} exit378 along Interstate 75 (I-75) near Kinross. A short section of it runs {{concurrently}} with H-63 (Mackinac Trail) {{to connect to}} ramps in the interchange. This section runs northeastâsouthwest across the freeway from Mud Lake before the M-80 designation turns southeasterly along Tone Road running past Kinross Lake in a forested area. Tone Road curves sharply northeasterly and then southeasterly to run around the north end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway</b> complex at the Chippewa County International Airport. The highway runs due east past the airport terminal area {{to the south and}} a prison and the residential area of the former Kincheloe Air Force Base to the north. Near Dukes Lake, M-80 crosses Gaines Highway and leaves the former base and runs through forest to the intersection with M-129 where M-80 terminates. The roadway continues eastward as 17Mile Road in Pickford Township.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 1952, the Comet {{suffered}} {{its first}} hull loss when a BOAC flight departing Rome's Ciampino airport failed to become airborne {{and ran into}} rough ground at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runway.</b> Two passengers sustained minor injuries, and the aircraft, G-ALYZ, was a total loss. On 3 March 1953, a new Canadian Pacific Airlines Comet 1A, registered CF-CUN and named Empress of Hawaii, failed to become airborne while attempting a night takeoff from Karachi, Pakistan, on a delivery flight to Australia. The aircraft plunged into a dry drainage canal and collided with an embankment, killing all five crew and six passengers on board. The accident was the first fatal jetliner crash, {{as well as the}} Comet's first accident to result in fatalities. In response, Canadian Pacific cancelled its remaining order for a second Comet 1A and never operated the type in commercial service.|$|E
25|$|Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runways</b> {{still exist}} and {{although}} they are heavily overgrown, Staffordshire Police use them for driver training. The former technical site is now occupied by an industrial estate which lets out space for companies as well as permanent occupancy buildings.|$|R
