5|$|Two {{people were}} arrested in 1997 and four in 1998 for espionage activities. Of those arrested in 1997, one was a male {{permanent}} resident who was a deep-cover operative of a foreign intelligence service who had used the other person, a female Singaporean, as a collaborator. Three of the people arrested in 1998 were agents for a foreign intelligence agency. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> recruited the fourth person to collect intelligence on and to subvert a local community organization. All the detainees were subsequently released.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, Aruban police {{detained}} Nick John and Abraham Jones, former {{security guards}} {{from the nearby}} Allegro Hotel (which was then closed for renovation) on suspicion of murder and kidnapping. Authorities have never officially disclosed the reason for their arrests, but according to news accounts, statements made by Van der Sloot and Kalpoe {{may have been a}} factor in the arrests of John and Jones. Reports also indicated that the two former guards were known for cruising hotels to pick up women, and at least <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> a prior incident with law enforcement. John and Jones were released on June 13 without being charged.|$|E
5|$|The next {{attack was}} on {{officers}} from the 9th Parachute Battalion on 28June. The officers were dining at a restaurant when two men of the Irgun approached and fired machine guns through the windows. One officer was killed outright while several others were wounded. The officers returned fire and the car the gunmen were escaping in crashed; later examination revealed at least <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> been wounded. On 19July two police officers on patrol in Haifa were {{shot in the back}} and killed. The following day the 3rd Parachute Brigade cordoned the area and imposed a night time curfew, which was not lifted until 30July.|$|E

5|$|During the battle, Oryol was {{probably}} hit by five 12-inch, two , nine , thirty-nine 6-inch shells, and 21 smaller rounds or fragments. Although {{the ship had}} many large holes in the unarmored portions of her side, she was only moderately damaged as all of the four (one 12-inch and three 6-inch) shells that hit her side armor failed to penetrate. The left gun of her forward 12-inch turret had been struck by an 8-inch shell that broke off its muzzle and another 8-inch shell struck {{the roof of the}} rear 12-inch turret and forced it down, which limited the maximum elevation of the left gun. Two 6-inch gun turrets had been jammed by hits from 8-inch shells and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> been burnt out by an ammunition fire. Another turret had been damaged by a 12-inch shell that struck its supporting tube. Splinters from two 6-inch shells entered the conning tower and wounded Yung badly enough that he later died of his wounds. Casualties totaled 43 crewmen killed and approximately 80 wounded.|$|E

25|$|There {{were more}} than 800 burials in the Anglo-Saxon cemeteries ranging in date from the early 5th to the 7th century. Two cemeteries were excavated, {{although}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> already been partially destroyed by gravel working. Cemetery II contained cremation and inhumation graves, while cemetery I contained only inhumations. Cemetery II (the undamaged cemetery) contained graves from which 125 brooches were recovered, allowing the reconstruction of Anglo-Saxon dress styles. The cemeteries were not used after the middle 7th century although the settlement continued in to the 8th century. Later burials may have been at a Christian cemetery associated with Cedd's minster church at Tilbury.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the history}} of the Soviet Union, there were at least 476 {{separate}} camp administrations. The Russian researcher Galina Ivanova stated that, to date, Russian historians have discovered and described 476 camps that existed at different times on the territory of the USSR. It is well known that practically every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> several branches, many of which were quite large. In addition to the large numbers of camps, there were no less than 2,000 colonies. It would be virtually impossible to reflect the entire mass of Gulag facilities on a map that would also account for the various times of their existence.|$|E
25|$|In 1786 Tipu Sultan, again {{following}} the lead of his father, decided to build a navy consisting of 20 battleships of 72 cannons and 20 frigates of 62 cannons. In the year 1790 he appointed Kamaluddin as his Mir Bahar and established massive dockyards at Jamalabad and Majidabad. Tipu Sultan's board of admiralty consisted of 11 commanders in service of a Mir Yam. A Mir Yam led 30 admirals and each <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> two ships. By the year 1789 most of Tipu Sultan's ships had copper-bottoms, an idea that increased the longevity of the ships and was introduced to Tipu by Admiral Suffren.|$|E

25|$|Firefighters often carry {{personal}} self-rescue ropes. The ropes {{are generally}} 30 {{feet long and}} can provide a firefighter (that has enough time to deploy the rope) a partially controlled exit out of an elevated window. Lack of a personal rescue rope is cited {{in the deaths of}} two New York City Firefighters, Lt. John Bellew and Lt. Curtis Meyran, who died after they jumped from the fourth floor of a burning apartment building in the Bronx. Of the four firefighters who jumped and survived, only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> a self-rescue rope. Since the incident, the Fire Department of New York City has issued self-rescue ropes to their firefighters.|$|E
25|$|The Morelands {{have spoken}} to journalists, {{including}} Edward R. Murrow, about family life in a lighthouse that was still, at the time, a half-mile from the nearest land. The Coast Guard supplied them with water, so they no longer needed {{to rely on the}} cistern, although it was still kept full. It was necessary {{to go back to the}} land at least every two days for milk, and they bought groceries every two weeks. The couple could never go out together as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> to remain at the lighthouse at all times. During one power outage, Richard Moreland hung an emergency kerosene lamp in the lantern house and rang the fog bell himself.|$|E
25|$|Sennacherib {{was assassinated}} in obscure {{circumstances}} in 681BCE. An inscription by Sennacherib's successor, Esarhaddon, describes how Esarhaddon heard that his brothers were fighting {{in the streets of}} Nineveh, hurried back from the Western provinces with an army, defeated them all, and took the throne. The inscription does not mention that the brothers were fighting because <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> just murdered Sennacherib, but this is indicated in the Babylonian chronicles, the Bible (Isaiah 37:36-38, Tobit 1:21), and in later Assyrian records. Esarhaddon's silence {{on the subject of the}} name of his father's murderer may have been to avoid perpetuating any perceptions of instability. To one Babylonian historian, it was divine punishment for what the king had done to Babylon.|$|E

25|$|This {{method of}} diving is {{commonly}} used in Philippines waters for pa-aling fishing, which is fishing with big nets on coral reef areas where a surface-dragged net would snag on coral; the compressor air hoses are also {{used to make a}} curtain of bubbles to corral and herd the fish into the nets, since muro-ami fishing was stopped in the area. At least one pa-aling fishing fleet has been found and arrested in a protected fishery area. Compressor diving was shown, and so called, used for pa-aling fishing, in episode 1 (Oceans: Into the Blue) of the BBC television series Human Planet. The cameramen used ordinary scuba gear, but <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> a trial-dive with the crew's compressor-diving gear.|$|E
25|$|The ILP {{still had}} some {{significant}} strength {{at the end}} of the war, but it went into crisis shortly afterward. At the 1945 general election it retained three MPs, all in Glasgow, although only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> a Labour opponent. Its conference rejected calls to reaffiliate to the Labour Party. A major blow came in 1946 when the party's best known public spokesman, James Maxton MP, died. The ILP narrowly held his seat in the Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1946 (against a Labour opponent). However all their MPs defected to Labour at various stages in 1947, and the party was roundly defeated at the Glasgow Camlachie by-election, 1948, in a seat they had won easily only three years earlier. The party was never again able to take a significant vote in a Parliamentary election.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of Dussek's music involves the piano or harp in some way. He wrote 35 sonatas for piano and 11 for piano duet, as well as numerous other works for both configurations. His chamber music output includes 65 violin sonatas, 24 piano (or harp) trios, {{and a variety of}} works for harp, harp or piano, or harp and piano. Some sonatas had trio parts added by J. B. Cramer. Orchestral works were limited to concertos, including 16 for piano (<b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> lost and two of them are remained dubious attribution), six for harp (three of them lost), and one for two pianos. He wrote a modest number of vocal works, include 12 songs, a cantata, a mass, and one opera, The Captive of Spilberg. His compositions also included arrangements of other works, especially opera overtures, for piano.|$|E
