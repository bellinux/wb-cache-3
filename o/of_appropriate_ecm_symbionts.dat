40|$|It {{is assumed}} that global change will cause a treeline shift. Because {{competitive}} abilities and natural regeneration of trees are infl uenced by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis and fi ne roots and ECM mycelia {{play a key role}} in belowground carbon turnover, we have studied the ECM associations of treeline ecosystems. We aim to fi nd out how resistant and resilient current ECM associations of these ecosystems are and whether the absence <b>of</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>ECM</b> <b>symbionts</b> could be a limiting factor of an ecosystem shift. We have focused on natural mountain spruce forests and spruce forests on the treeline; dwarf pine stands with scattered spruce trees above the treeline will be studied in years to come. Ectomycorrhizas were described by morphological features and sequenced to identify fungal species. In the case of taxonomically complicated ECM fungal groups, sequences from microscopically identifi ed sporocarps were used for the identifi cation of ectomycorrhizas. A disproportion between ECM fungi diversity in spruce stands and dwarf pine stands revealed based on a literature review can indicate diff erent ectomycorrhiza patterns at the treeline. According to preliminary results from the Giant Mts. there is an adequate ECM fungal species diversity in mountain spruce forest and spruce forests on the treeline...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{auditing}} can be {{an important}} contribution for identification and assessment of energy conservation measures (ECMs) in buildings. Numerous tools and software have been developed, with varying degree of precision and complexity and different areas of use.   This paper evaluates PHPP as a versatile, easy-to-use energy auditing tool and gives examples of how it has been compared to a dynamic simulation tool, within the EU-project iNSPiRe. PHPP is a monthly balance energy calculation tool based on EN 13790. It is intended for assisting the design of Passive Houses and energy renovation projects and as guidance in the choice <b>of</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>ECMs.</b>   PHPP was compared against the transient simulation software TRNSYS for a single family house and a multi-family house. It should be mentioned that dynamic building simulations might strongly depend on the model assumptions and simplifications compared to reality, such as ideal heating or real heat emission system. Setting common boundary conditions for both PHPP and TRNSYS, the ideal heating and cooling loads and demands were compared on monthly and annual basis for seven European locations and buildings with different floor area, S/V ratio, U-values and glazed area of the external walls.   The results show that PHPP can be used to assess the heating demand of single-zone buildings and the reduction of heating demand with ECMs with good precision. The estimation of cooling demand is also acceptable if an appropriate shading factor is applied in PHPP. In general, PHPP intentionally overestimates heating and cooling loads, {{to be on the safe}} side for system sizing. Overall, the agreement with TRNSYS is better in cases with higher quality of the envelope as in cold climates and for good energy standards. As an energy auditing tool intended for pre-design it is a good, versatile and easy-to-use alternative to more complex simulation tools. QC 20161107 iNSPiR...|$|R

While most truffles form ectomycorrhizal relationships, it is unclear is {{this is true of}} Fevansia aurentiaca. There are no DNA matches to ECM root tips that suggests Fevasia forms these relationships. It is most likely, however, because it is most often found under ECM forming Pinaceae. The new DNA evidence that puts Fevansia in the Albatrellaceae also suggests that it is an <b>ECM</b> <b>symbiont,</b> like most members of that family.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Mycorrhizal fungi are {{important}} {{contributors to the}} functioning of boreal forests, since they act in the bilateral carbon and nutrient transport between above- and belowground parts of the ecosystem. In ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis of woody host plants, both fungal and plant partners depend on resources provided by the other. A single tree may simultaneously host several ECM fungal partners, which greatly enhance the host's nutrient uptake. At the same time nearly 20 % of host primary production is allocated to mycorrhizal fungi. Although fungi depend on host-derived carbon, it is poorly understood how reduced carbon availability, e. g., due to herbivory, affects the <b>ECM</b> fungal <b>symbionts.</b> In this thesis I studied the impact of simulated insect defoliation or mammal browsing on mycorrhizal fungi of boreal woody hosts. Quantitative and qualitative changes in biomass partitioning in different fungal compartments were detected. None of the experiments showed that defoliation or shoot clipping treatments reduced the intensity of ECM colonisation, while treatments often shifted fungal composition towards less biomass producing ECM morphotypes. Above- and belowground diversity in <b>ECM</b> <b>symbionts</b> tended to decrease due to shoot or foliar damage. In addition, in some cases defoliation also reduced fungal biomass in fine roots and decreased ECM sexual reproduction by {{reducing the number of}} sporocarps produced. Defoliation induced a similar response pattern in the host and in ECM fungi with a stronger response to increasing severity of treatment (e. g. degree of removed foliage or repeated years of defoliation). This was also confirmed when relating the effects of host and <b>ECM</b> fungal <b>symbionts</b> to defoliation using present and previously published data. The present results suggest that belowground adaptation of boreal trees to the changing environment is mediated by changes in fungal community or biomass partitioning. The lack of response in the intensity of ECM colonisation further emphasises the importance of the symbiosis to boreal trees...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} planting sites on the establishment and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) colonization of American chestnut (Castanea denetata (Marsh.) Borkh.) on an abandoned coal mine in an Appalachian region of the United States. Root morphotyping and sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region were used to identify the ECM species associated with the chestnut seedlings. Germination, survival, ECM root colonization, and growth were assessed in three habitats: forest edge, center (plots without vegetation), and pine plots (a 10 -year-old planting of Pinus virginiana). Seedlings in pine plots had higher survival (38 %) than the other plot types (center 9 % and forest edge 5 %; P= 0. 007). Chestnuts found colonized by ECM within the pine plots were larger (P= 0. 02), contributed by a larger root system (P= 0. 03). Forest edge and pine plots had more ECM roots than seedlings in center plots (P= 0. 04).

40|$|In this work, by artificially {{reproducing}} severe (75 %) {{and moderate}} (25 %) defoliation on maritime pines Pinus pinaster in NW Spain, we investigated, under natural conditions, {{the consequences of}} foliage loss on reproduction, abundance, diversity and richness of the fungal symbionts growing belowground and aboveground. The effect of defoliation on tree growth was also assessed. Mature needles were clipped during April 2007 and 2008. Root samples were collected in June-July 2007 and 2008. Collection of sporocarps was performed weekly from April 2007 to April 2009. Taxonomic identity of ectomycorrhizal fungi was assessed by using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rDNA through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, subsequent direct sequencing and BLAST search. Ectomycorrhizal colonization was significantly reduced (from 54 to 42 %) in 2008 by 75 % defoliation, accompanied with a decline in species richness and diversity. On the other hand, sporocarp abundance, richness and diversity were not affected by foliage loss. Some <b>ECM</b> fungal <b>symbionts,</b> which are assumed {{to have a higher}} carbon cost according to the morphotypes structure, were reduced due to severe (75 %) defoliation. Furthermore, 75 % foliage loss consistently depressed tree growth, which in turn affected the ectomycorrhizal growth pattern. Defoliation impact on <b>ECM</b> <b>symbionts</b> largely depends on the percentage of foliage removal and on the number of defoliation bouts. Severe defoliation (75 %) in the short term (2 years) changed the composition of the ECM community likely because root biomass would be adjusted to lower levels in parallel with the depletion of the aboveground plant biomass, which probably promoted the competition among mycorrhizal types for host resources. The persistence of fungal biomass in mycorrhizal roots would be crucial for nutrient up-take and recovery from defoliation stress of the host plants. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|Ligaments are a dense {{connective}} tissue responsible for joint movements and stability. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) {{is one of the}} four major ligaments of the knee. Being subjected to high physiological loads, ACL is commonly injured,Surgical management with ligament grafts is often required, but these treatments are associated with complications of reduced strength, joint stiffness, repair-rupture. Interface Tissue engineering (ITE) may effectively address these complications where an artificial ligament incorporating the interfacial fibrocartilage can be engineered to provide similar mechanical and functional characteristics as the native tissue. Therefore a multi-compartmental scaffold that can induce the growth and differentiation of fibrocartilage at the interface of engineered bone and ligament tissues would mimic the native structure of bone-ligament –bone block with deposition <b>of</b> <b>appropriate</b> extracellular matrix (<b>ECM)</b> in respective compartments and possession of adequate mechanical properties to support the healing tissue. The current project has focused on the fabrication of a silk-based knitted scaffold which comprises of three compartments, one each for the bone, ligament and enthesis tissues. an array of methods were adopted for surface modification of the compartmentalized knitted silk scaffold by using bio-polymers such as silk solution, chitosan, gelatin and hydroxyapatite on the appropriate compartments. The ligament and bone compartments were reserved for mature cell line culture like MG 63 and Saos- 2. The various methods used for coatings of polymers over the knitted-silk were alternate soaking, plain coating and freeze-drying. The knitted scaffold was characterized for its water absorption biodegradability,tensile strength, and bio compatibility. Such a complex graft with incorporation of enthesis in laboratory can provide natural insertional strength at the interface and can change the current scenario of replacing injured ligaments...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi on forest nursery production {{is regarded as}} part of good management practice. However, before employing large scale inoculations in a nursery the interaction between <b>ECM</b> <b>symbionts,</b> growth substrate and fertilisation input should be studied to select the most suitable nursery practices for promoting plant growth and ECM colonisation. In this study, seedlings of Quercus ilex were inoculated with Paxillus involutus, Hebeloma mesophaeum or Cenococcum geophilum and grown in three different substrates commonly used in forest nurseries: peat-based compost, forest soil or composted pine bark. The effect of various fertilisation regimes was also studied. The choice of substrate {{had a significant effect}} on plant growth and ECM colonisation. The most <b>appropriate</b> combination <b>of</b> substrate and ECM fungus for Q. ilex growth and nutrition was peat and H. mesophaeum. Plants grown on a peat-based compost and inoculated with H. mesophaeum had a significantly greater biomass and leaf phosphorus concentration without fertilisation. Composted pine bark was found not to be suitable for growth or for mycorrhization. If the appropriate growth substrate is selected, it is possible to replace the use of chemical fertilisers by inoculation with selected ECM fungi. This results in a significant increase in plant development, and thus ECM fungi can be recommended as a more environmental friendly biotechnological approach to plant management in the nursery...|$|R
40|$|The role of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) {{fungi in}} the {{interface}} between plant and soil environment is key in explaining ecosystem processes and functions, in particular in the recovery of ecosystem services in degraded environments. Using a trait-based approach, we aimed to study how the effects of soil contamination by trace elements on individual trees were mediated by changes in the community composition and functional traits of <b>ECM</b> <b>symbionts.</b> Soil abiotic properties and ECM patterns of colonization were characterised on holm oak trees (Quercus ilex subsp. ballota) in areas with different levels of contamination in the Guadiamar Green Corridor, in SW Spain. A variety of morphological traits were characterised for both the trees and their associated ECM fungal species, {{as well as the}} molecular characterisation of ECM fungal communities. ECM communities’ composition was found to be dependent on soil pH, nutrients and contamination levels. The two most abundant ECM fungal taxa, Hebeloma cavipes and Thelephora terrestris, had contrasting distributions: H. cavipes was found in non-contaminated soils while T. terrestris was associated with acidic soils. Among the studied fungal traits, frequency of emanating hyphae was found to be clustered among species in the communities in contaminated soils. The reduction of emanating hyphae in contaminated soils had an effect on the associated trees by reducing their phosphorous uptake. In conclusion, soil contamination acted as an environmental filter to ECM fungal communities which decreased their functional diversity posing a negative effect on holm oaks performance. N...|$|R
40|$|Fungi {{are major}} players in the carbon cycle in forest {{ecosystems}} due to the wide range of interactions they have with plants either through soil degradation processes by litter decayers or biotrophic interactions with pathogenic and ectomycorrhizal symbionts. Secretion of fungal proteins mediates these interactions by allowing the fungus to interact with its environment and/or host. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis independently appeared several times throughout evolution and involves approximately 80 % of trees. Despite extensive physiological studies on <b>ECM</b> <b>symbionts,</b> {{little is known about the}} composition and specificities of their secretomes. In this study, we used a bioinformatics pipeline to predict and analyze the secretomes of 49 fungal species, including 11 ECM fungi, wood and soil decayers and pathogenic fungi to tackle the following questions: (1) Are there differences between the secretomes of saprophytic and ECM fungi? (2) Are small-secreted proteins (SSPs) more abundant in biotrophic fungi than in saprophytic fungi? and (3) Are there SSPs shared between ECM, saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi? We showed that the number of predicted secreted proteins is similar in the surveyed species, independently of their lifestyle. The secretome from ECM fungi is characterized by a restricted number of secreted CAZymes, but their repertoires of secreted proteases and lipases are similar to those of saprotrophic fungi. Focusing on SSPs, we showed that the secretome of ECM fungi is enriched in SSPs compared with other species. Most of the SSPs are coded by orphan genes with no known PFAM domain or similarities to known sequences in databases. Finally, based on the clustering analysis, we identified shared- and lifestyle-specific SSPs between saprotrophic and ECM fungi. The presence of SSPs is not limited to fungi interacting with living plants as the genome of saprotrophic fungi also code for numerous SSPs. ECM fungi shared lifestyle specific SSPs likely involved in symbiosis that are good candidates for further functional analyses...|$|R
40|$|Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) {{communities}} of mature trees and regenerating seedlings of a non-native tree species Pinus mugo grown in a harsh {{environment of the}} coastal region of the Curonian Spit National Park in Lithuania were assessed. We established three study sites (S 1, S 2, and S 3) that were separated from each other by 15  km. The ECM species richness was rather low in particular for mature, 100 -year-old trees: 12 ectomycorrhizal taxa were identified by molecular analysis from 11 distinguished morphotypes. All 12 taxa were present on seedlings and on mature trees, with between 8 – 11 and 9 – 11 taxa present on seedlings and mature trees, respectively. Cenococcum geophilum dominated all ECM communities, but the relative abundance of C. geophilum mycorrhizas was nearly two times higher on seedlings than on mature trees. Mycorrhizal associations formed by Wilcoxina sp., Lactarius rufus, and Russula paludosa were also abundant. Several fungal taxa were only occasionally detected, including Cortinarius sp., Cortinarius obtusus, Cortinarius croceus, and Meliniomyces sp. Shannon’s diversity indices for the ECM assemblages of P. mugo ranged from 0. 98 to 1. 09 for seedling and from 1. 05 to 1. 31 for mature trees. According to analysis of similarity, the mycorrhizal communities were similar between the sites (R[*]=[*] 0. 085; P[*]=[*] 0. 06) and only slightly separated between seedlings and mature trees (R[*]=[*] 0. 24; P[*]<[*] 0. 0001). An incidental fruiting body survey that was conducted weakly reflected the below-ground assessment of the ECM fungal community and once again showed that ECM and fruiting body studies commonly supply different partial accounts of the true ECM fungal diversity. Our results show that P. mugo has moved into quite distinct habitats {{and is able to}} adapt a suite of <b>ECM</b> <b>symbionts</b> that sufficiently support growth and development of this tree and allow for natural seedling regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Scleroderma, a genus of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, {{is often}} {{associated}} with trees in disturbed habitats and is therefore considered to be suitable for use in plantation forestry. This study investigated aspects of Scleroderma and its mycorrhizas with the view to its future use in plantation forestry in south China. Spores were chosen as inoculum as they are preferred by nursery managers in south China, {{due to the lack of}} on-site fermentation and storage facilities. To determine the need for inoculation, Eucalyptus plantations in south China were sampled for sporocarps and mycorrhizas over two years. This study revealed a low diversity of ECM fungi consisting of 15 taxa fruiting beneath Eucalyptus plantations. The most common genera were Scleroderma and Pisolithus, but they were infrequent and the extent of root colonization was poor. Bioassay trials with E. urophylla as a bait host, using soils collected from 8 eucalypt plantations, confirmed low levels of inoculum in field soil. It was concluded that introduction of suitable <b>ECM</b> <b>symbionts</b> into eucalypt nurseries in south China is desirable in the future. As the Scleroderma genus has not been well studied in Australasia or SE Asia, over 140 collections gathered mainly from eucalypt plantations in south China and south-western Australia were described using sporocarp and spore morphology. Twelve Scleroderma taxa were recognized from collections made from under eucalypt plantations in south-western Australia and 6 of these were collected from under eucalypt plantations in south China. In conjunction with classical taxonomy, 30 collections, including those used in inoculation trials, were further characterized by phylogenetic analyses of ITS or LSU rDNA sequences. These studies supported classical delineation of some Scleroderma species but not all. Although a limited number of collections were amplified, phylogenetic results showed that most collections in this study were distinct from the European and Malaysian taxa extracted from GenBank (89...|$|R
