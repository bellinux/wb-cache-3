This device uses regions of different depths to generate and transport the droplets, which further simplifies the operation and reduces the need for precise flow control. The use of robust consumer electronics, combined with open source hardware, leads to a great reduction in the price of the device, as well as its footprint, without reducing its performance compared with the laboratory setup...|$|E
40|$|Jewish and British {{histories}} {{were never}} more fatefully intertwined {{than during the}} 1930 s and 40 s, but {{the period of the}} British Mandate in Palestine receives relatively little attention <b>outside</b> <b>specialist</b> circles and does not feature centrally in the many debates about Empire, decolonisation and diaspora. This is not necessarily (just) a result of non-Jewish amnesia, but also relates to the fact that for many British Jews the anti-colonial struggle of the Zionists in Palestine were (and perhaps still are) as acute an embarrassment as the contentious politics of the state of Israel. Since the late 1980 s, however, contemporary British Jewish writers have repeatedly made this period and relationship the focus of their narratives. The article argues that British Jewish fictions of the historical colonial encounter of the Jews with the British during the Palestine Mandate bring about the convergence not only of English (or British) and Jewish identification patterns, but also of English and Jewish constructions of the past. The contribution discusses works by Linda Grant, Bernice Rubens and Jonathan Wilson...|$|E
40|$|THERE is a {{widespread}} reluctance amongst surgeons to undertake cholecystectomy {{on the basis of}} symptoms alone. These views derive from early studies suggesting an unacceptable incidence of the post-cholecystectomy syndrome in such cases. ' There is however, a well recognised group of patients with typical biliary tract symptoms and normal oral cholecystography ('stoneless symptoms') who pose considerable management problems. It has been suggested that the persistence of contrast medium in the gall bladder on a straight x-ray taken 24 hours after an otherwise normal cholecystogram is a reliable index of gall bladder dysfunction. 2 Whilst more sophisticated techniques of demonstrating gall bladder function exist these are not universally available, <b>outside</b> <b>specialist</b> centres. The concept, that the simple, inexpensive, addition of one further x-ray, 24 hours after normal oral cholecystography might help to select out those with genuine gall bladder pathology, has considerable clinical appeal.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comBackground: The majority of patients with liver trauma can be managed conservatively. However, the unstable patient requires emergency laparotomy to control bleeding. Controversy exists regarding the primary surgical management of these injuries. This is of particular relevance for the isolated rural general surgeon. Methods: The literature was reviewed by searching MEDLINE databases from 1966 to the present time. The majority of the evidence presented is level 3, with interpretations and recommendations based {{on the experience of}} the senior authors. Results: In the majority of patients, conservative management remains the mainstay of treatment. However, haemodynamic instability requires urgent laparotomy. Perihepatic packing should be used to arrest bleeding. Primary anatomical resection is rarely indicated, especially in non-specialist centres. Conclusion: In the remote rural setting, severe liver trauma remains a daunting condition for the general surgeon to manage. Primary surgical treatment should be perihepatic packing, stabilization and urgent transfer; there is no place for primary anatomical resection <b>outside</b> <b>specialist</b> units. Simon A.

40|$|Summary: Background: Three-quarters {{of people}} who commit suicide are not in contact with mental health {{services}} {{at the time of}} death. No previous UK study has focused specifically on this group of suicides. Aims: To identify the characteristics {{of people who}} commit suicide while outside the care of mental health services. Method: A case-control study was conducted in SW England involving 100 individuals who committed suicide while not in contact with mental health services and 100 age-sex matched controls drawn from the living population. Data were collected by means of semistructured interviews with key informants and from medical records. Results: Key predictors of suicide were previous attempted suicide, social and interpersonal problems, current mental illness, past mental illness, and previous contact with specialist services. However, nearly a third of cases (32 %) appeared to have no current mental disorder. Conclusion: This group is distinguished by a markedly lower rate of mental illness than has previously been recorded. The findings highlight the difficulty of identifying individuals <b>outside</b> <b>specialist</b> mental health care who are at risk of suicide and therefore support the continued development of broad population-based measures rather than the targeting of high-risk groups...|$|E
40|$|Background: Domestic {{violence}} and abuse (DVA), defined as threatening behavior or abuse by {{adults who are}} intimate partners or family members, is a key public health and clinical priority. The prevalence of DVA in the United Kingdom and worldwide is high, {{and its impact on}} physical and mental health is detrimental and persistent. There is currently little support within healthcare settings for women experiencing DVA. Psychological problems in particular may be difficult to manage <b>outside</b> <b>specialist</b> services, as conventional forms of therapy such as counseling that do not address the violence may be ineffective or even harmful. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the overall effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a novel psychological intervention tailored specifically for survivors of DVA and delivered by domestic violence advocates based in third-sector organizations. Methods and study design: This study is an open, pragmatic, parallel group, individually randomized controlled trial. Women ages 16 years and older experiencing domestic violence are being enrolled and randomly allocated to receive usual DVA agency advocacy support (control) or usual DVA agency support plus psychological intervention (intervention). Those in the intervention group will receive eight specialist psychological advocacy (SPA) sessions weekly or fortnightly, with two follow-up sessions, 1 month and then 3 months later.
