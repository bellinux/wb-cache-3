5|$|Through {{his actions}} and speeches, {{and because he}} was able to symbolize the popular Arab will, Nasser {{inspired}} several nationalist revolutions in the Arab world. He defined the politics of his generation and communicated directly with the public masses of the Arab world, bypassing the various heads of states of those countries—an accomplishment not repeated by other Arab leaders. The extent of Nasser's centrality in the region made it a priority for incoming Arab nationalist heads of state to seek good relations with Egypt, in order to gain popular legitimacy from their <b>own</b> <b>citizens.</b>|$|E

5|$|The United Nations Commission on Human Rights {{came under}} fire during its {{existence}} for the high-profile positions it gave to member states that did not guarantee {{the human rights of}} their <b>own</b> <b>citizens.</b> Several nations known to have been guilty of gross violations of human rights became members of the organization, such as Libya, Cuba, Sudan, Algeria, China, Azerbaijan and Vietnam. Meanwhile, the United States was also angry when it was ejected from the Commission in 2002. While it was re-elected, the election of human rights-abusing nations also caused frictions. It was partly because of these problems that Kofi Annan in the In Larger Freedom report suggested setting up a new Human Rights Council as a subsidiary UN body.|$|E
5|$|World {{leaders and}} their diplomats have taken note of Twitter's rapid {{expansion}} and have been increasingly utilizing Twitter diplomacy, the use of Twitter to engage with foreign publics and their <b>own</b> <b>citizens.</b> US Ambassador to Russia, Michael A. McFaul has been attributed as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy. He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in 2011, posting in English and Russian. On October 24, 2014, Queen Elizabeth II sent her first tweet to mark {{the opening of the}} London Science Museum's Information Age exhibition. A 2013 study by website Twiplomacy found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the United Nations had established government Twitter accounts. The same study also found that those accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world {{leaders and their}} foreign ministers, with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} spring of 313, as Licinius {{advanced}} against Maximinus, the latter resorted to savagery in his dealings with his <b>own</b> <b>citizens,</b> and his Christians in particular. In May 313, Maximinus issued one more edict of toleration, hoping to persuade Licinius to stop advancing, and win more public support. For the first time, Maximinus issued a law which offered comprehensive toleration {{and the means to}} effectively secure it. As in his earlier letter, Maximinus is apologetic but one-sided. Maximinus absolves himself for all the failings of his policy, locating fault with local judges and enforcers instead. He frames the new universal toleration as a means of removing all ambiguity and extortion. Maximinus then declares full freedom of religious practice, encourages Christians to rebuild their churches, and pledges to restore Christian property lost in the persecution. The edict changed little: Licinius defeated Maximinus at the Battle of Adrianople on April 30, 313; the now-powerless Maximinus committed suicide at Tarsus in the summer of 313. On June 13, Licinius published the Edict of Milan in Nicomedia.|$|E

5000|$|Mascoutah was {{considered}} a progressive town near {{the turn of the}} 20th century. The town saw steady growth thanks to the construction of a train depot in 1870, courtesy of the Southern Railway Company. The largest Turner Hall in Southern Illinois was established in Mascoutah in 1873 which served as the center of town social life, and the town constructed its <b>own</b> <b>citizen</b> <b>owned</b> power plant in 1894. The Mascoutah Herald was established in 1885 and remains in production to this day.

40|$|Using the Source-Position-Performance (SPP) {{framework}} and {{the literature on}} information and communication technology (ICT) impact, we posit that the IS capabilities <b>owned</b> by <b>citizens</b> (i. e., source of advantage) lead to ICT penetration among them (i. e., positional advantage), which in turn affects the sustainability of the country (i. e., national performance). Based on secondary data from 120 countries, our results supported the hypothesized model. Specifically, IS capabilities <b>owned</b> by <b>citizens</b> in a country {{appears to be a}} significant enabler of ICT penetration among them, which in turn lead to the management of national performance in terms of economic, environmental, and social sustainability.
