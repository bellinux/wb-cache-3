25|$|A {{heritage}} {{turkey is}} one of a variety of strains of domestic turkey which retains historic characteristics that are no longer present in the majority <b>of</b> <b>turkeys</b> raised for consumption since the mid-20th century. Heritage turkeys can be differentiated from other domestic turkeys in that they are biologically capable of being raised in a manner that more closely matches the natural behavior and life cycle of wild turkeys. Heritage turkeys have a relatively long lifespan and a much slower growth rate than turkeys bred for industrial agriculture, and unlike industrially-bred turkeys, can reproduce without artificial insemination.|$|E

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>turkeys</b> are reared indoors in purpose-built or modified buildings {{of which there}} are many types. [...] Some types have slatted walls to allow ventilation, but many have solid walls and no windows to allow artificial lighting manipulations to optimise production. [...] The buildings can be very large (converted aircraft hangars are sometimes used) and may contain tens of thousands of birds as a single flock. The floor substrate is usually deep-litter, e.g. wood shavings, which relies upon the controlled build-up of a microbial flora requiring skilful management. Ambient temperatures for adult domestic turkeys are usually maintained between 18 and 21°C. High temperatures should be avoided because the high metabolic rate <b>of</b> <b>turkeys</b> (up to 69W/bird) makes them susceptible to heat stress, exacerbated by high stocking densities. [...] Commercial turkeys are kept under a variety of lighting schedules, e.g. continuous light, long photoperiods (23 h), or intermittent lighting, to encourage feeding and accelerate growth. [...] Light intensity is usually low (e.g. less than one lux) to reduce feather pecking.|$|E

2500|$|In recent years, the aim {{has been}} to develop more {{permanent}} beak trimming (although repeat trimming may be required), using [...] electrically heated blades in a beak trimming machine, to provide a self-cauterizing cut. [...] There are currently (2012) four widely used methods of beak trimming: hot blade, cold blade (including scissors or secateurs), electrical (the Bio-beaker) and infrared. [...] The latter two methods usually remove {{only the tip of}} the beak and do not leave an open wound, therefore they may offer improvements in welfare. Other approaches {{such as the use of}} lasers, freeze drying and chemical retardation have been investigated but are not in widespread use. [...] The infrared method directs a strong source of heat into the inner tissue of the beak and after a few weeks, the tip of the upper and lower beak dies and drops off making the beak shorter with blunt tips. [...] The Bio-beaker, which uses an electric current to burn a small hole in the upper beak, is the preferred method for trimming the beaks <b>of</b> <b>turkeys.</b> [...] The Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) wrote regarding beak trimming <b>of</b> <b>turkeys</b> that cold cutting was the most accurate method, but that substantial re-growth of the beak occurred; although the Bio-beaker limited beak re-growth, it was less accurate. [...] It was considered that the hot cut was the most distressing procedure for turkeys.|$|E

2500|$|Beak {{trimming}} is {{most common}} in egg-laying strains of chickens. [...] In some countries such as the United States, turkeys routinely have their beaks trimmed, however, in the UK, only 10% <b>of</b> <b>turkeys</b> are beak trimmed. [...] Beak trimming is a preventive measure to reduce damage caused by injurious pecking such as cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking, and thereby improve livability. [...] Commercial broiler chickens are not routinely beak trimmed as they reach slaughter weight at approximately 6 weeks of age, i.e. before injurious pecking usually begins. [...] However, broiler breeding stock may be trimmed to prevent damage during mating. [...] In some countries, beak trimming is done {{as a last resort}} where alternatives are considered not to be possible or appropriate.|$|E

2500|$|The forms {{sacrifice}} {{might take}} vary considerably. In contemporary sacrificial rites, {{there is an}} overall emphasis on the sprinkling of blood, especially that <b>of</b> <b>turkeys.</b> In the pre-Spanish past, sacrifice usually consisted of animals such as deer, dog, quail, turkey, and fish, but on exceptional occasions (such as accession to the throne, severe illness of the ruler, royal burial, or drought and famine) also came to include human beings, adults as well as children. The sacrificed child may {{have served as a}} 'substitute', a concept known from curing ritual. Partaking of the sacrifice was common, but ritual cannibalism appears to have been exceedingly rare. A characteristic feature of ancient Mayan ritual (though not exclusive to the Mayas) were the [...] "bloodletting" [...] sessions held by high officials and members of the royal families, during which the earlobes, tongues, and foreskins were cut with razor-sharp small knives and stingray spines; the blood fell on paper strips that were possibly burnt afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|Whenever natural {{fletching}} is used, {{the feathers}} {{on any one}} arrow must {{come from the same}} wing of the bird. The most common being the right-wing flight feathers <b>of</b> <b>turkeys.</b> [...] The slight cupping of natural feathers requires them to be fletched with a right-twist for right wing, a left-twist for left wing. This rotation, through a combination of gyroscopic stabilization and increased drag on the rear of the arrow, helps the arrow to fly straight away. [...] Artificial helical fletchings have the same effect. Most arrows will have three fletches, but some have four or even more. Fletchings generally range from two to six inches (152mm) in length; flight arrows intended to travel the maximum possible distance typically have very low fletching, while hunting arrows with broadheads require long and high fletching to stabilize them against the aerodynamic effect of the head. [...] Fletchings may also be cut in different ways, the two most common being parabolic (i.e. a smooth curved shape) and shield (i.e. shaped as one-half of a very narrow shield) cut.|$|E
2500|$|Stocking {{density is}} {{an issue in the}} welfare of {{commercial}} turkeys and high densities are a major animal welfare concern. [...] Permitted stocking densities for turkeys reared indoors vary according to geography and animal welfare farm assurance schemes. [...] For example, in Germany, there is a voluntary maximum of 52kg/m2 and 58kg/m2 for males and females respectively. [...] In the UK, the RSPCA Freedom Foods assurance scheme reduces permissible stocking density to 25kg/m2 for turkeys reared indoors. [...] Turkeys maintained at commercial stocking densities (8 birds/m2; 61kg/m2) exhibit increased welfare problems such as increases in gait abnormalities, hip and foot lesions, and bird disturbances, and decreased bodyweight compared with lower stocking densities. [...] Turkeys reared at 8 birds/m2 have a higher incidence of hip lesions and foot pad dermatitis than those reared at 6.5 or 5.0 birds/m2. [...] Insufficient space may lead to an increased risk for injuries such as broken wings caused by hitting the pen walls or other turkeys during aggressive encounters and can also lead to heat stress. The problems of small space allowance are exacerbated by the major influence of social facilitation on the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>turkeys.</b> If turkeys are to feed, drink, dust-bathe, etc., simultaneously, then to avoid causing frustration, resources and space must be available in large quantities.|$|E
