40|$|AbstractBased on Structural Vector Auto-regression Model (SVAR), {{this paper}} divides global crude oil price shock into oil supply shock, global demand shock, {{domestic}} demand shock and precautionary demand shock. It analyzes {{the impacts of}} the four types of oil price shocks on the stock returns of China's <b>oil</b> exploitation <b>industry,</b> <b>oil</b> refinery <b>industry</b> and <b>oil</b> sales <b>industry</b> by impulse response function. The sample is from 1, 2008 to 12, 2013. The results show that all the returns of the three industries response to all the four oil price shocks positively, and the impacts of the three demand shocks are most significant. What's more, the returns of different industries response to different oil price shocks differently. The returns of <b>oil</b> exploitation <b>industry</b> is mainly influenced by domestic demand shock, while precautionary demand shock plays the dominant factor of the returns of oil exploitation and <b>oil</b> sales <b>industries.</b> In addition, the more connected with the market, the more significant the impacts of oil price shocks on the returns. Namely, the return of <b>oil</b> sales <b>industry</b> responses to all oil price shocks most significantly, that of <b>oil</b> refinery <b>industry</b> comes second and that of <b>oil</b> exploitation <b>industry</b> comes the last...|$|R
