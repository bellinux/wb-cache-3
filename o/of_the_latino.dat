While many of the male leaders of the movement had the role of being dynamic, powerful speakers that would inspire others to join the movement, the women devoted their efforts to negotiating better working contracts with companies, organizing boycotts, rallying for changes in immigration policies, registering Latinos to vote with Spanish language ballots, and increasing pressure on legislation to improve labor relations.|$|E
25|$|Philadelphia {{has been}} a heavy Puerto Rican {{destination}} since the 1950s, though migration to the city has picked up and now Philadelphia {{has one of the}} fastest-growing Puerto Rican populations in the country. Puerto Ricans constitute over 75% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> population in the city. Most Puerto Ricans live in the areas of North Philadelphia east of Germantown Avenue (eastern North Philadelphia), and to a lesser extant the Lower Northeast and Uptown sections of the city. In fact, the Fairhill section of Eastern North Philadelphia, particularly the blocks between 6th street and B street, north of York street and south of Erie avenue, have some of highest concentrations of Puerto Ricans in the country, with most blocks usually being around 85-90% Puerto Rican alone, with most of the remaining portion made up of Dominicans and African Americans. Increases in Latino immigration and migration have fueled the growth of El Centro de Oro in Fairhill.|$|E

Other issues in the city proper of Dallas include an increase in immigration of Latinos. In the 1980s and 1990s, the school district had a majority of black students.

40|$|African-Americans and Latinos make {{up about}} 60 % of Chicago's population. This {{research}} looks at how these groups view local TV news coverage of their communities. A random telephone survey of 340 blacks and bilingual Latinos reveals that only 35 % think their race or ethnic group is accurately portrayed on local TV news. They rate local news as "good" in general, but say it does only a "fair" job of covering their ethnic community. The most common complaint, brought up {{by more than half}} the blacks and nearly one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latinos</b> is that TV news focuses on the bad things in their community and rarely reports the good. African-Americans are three times more likely than Latinos to say local TV news hurts race relations in the city, though the largest number said it makes no difference. The two groups watch about <b>the</b> same amount <b>of</b> local TV news, averaging 5. 6 days a week. African-Americans are significantly more likely than Latinos to have a favorite anchor and show a strong preference for black anchors. While 80 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latinos</b> surveyed also watch Spanish-language local TV news, they watch it less often than English-language stations. Main Report Methdology Appendix...|$|R

2500|$|The diverse Hispanic and Latin American {{population}} in Bergen {{is growing in}} many areas of the county but is especially concentrated in a handful of municipalities, including Fairview (37.1%), Hackensack (25.9%), Ridgefield Park (22.2%), Englewood (21.8%), Bogota (21.3%), Garfield (20.1%), Cliffside Park (18.2%), Lodi (18.0%), and Bergenfield (17.0%). Traditionally, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> residents were of Colombian and Cuban ancestry, although that has been changing in recent years. Englewood's Colombian community is the largest in Bergen County and among the top ten in the United States (7.17%); Hackensack, Fairview, Bergenfield, Bogota, and Lodi also have notable populations. [...] The Cuban population is largest in Fairview, Ridgefield Park, Ridgefield, and Bogota, although the Cuban community is much bigger in Hudson County to the south.

2500|$|On December 16 at , Del Rio {{turned into}} a fan {{favorite}} {{for the first time}} in his WWE career, when he saved Ricardo Rodriguez and the Spanish announcers from 3MB (Drew McIntyre, Heath Slater, and Jinder Mahal). Later in the event, Del Rio teamed with The Miz and The Brooklyn Brawler to defeat 3MB in a six-man tag team match. The next night on Raw, Del Rio and Miz teamed up with Tommy Dreamer to defeat 3MB in another six-man tag team match. On the December 28 episode of SmackDown, Ricardo Rodriguez was awarded a title match against World Heavyweight Champion Big Show, but Show knocked Rodriguez out backstage. Del Rio was then awarded the title match in Rodriguez's place, however, the match ended in a no contest after Sheamus attacked Big Show. On the December 31 episode of Raw, Show chose to defend his title against Ricardo Rodriguez. As Rodriguez was about to lose the match, Del Rio attacked Show from behind, causing a disqualification and re-igniting a feud between Del Rio and Show. On the January 11 episode SmackDown, as Del Rio's character transitioned into a hero <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> fanbase, he defeated Show in a Last Man Standing match to win his first World Heavyweight Championship. Del Rio made his first successful title defense on January 27 at the Royal Rumble, defeating Show in another Last Man Standing match, after Rodriguez duct taped Show's legs to the ropes. After repeated attacks from Show to both himself and Rodriguez, Del Rio and Show faced off in a singles match on February 17 at Elimination Chamber, where Del Rio submitted him to the cross armbreaker to retain his title. Del Rio then began a feud with his new number one contender, Jack Swagger, over his opposing political views regarding immigration in America. The feud escalated on the March 18 episode of Raw, when Swagger broke Rodriguez's ankle with his Patriot Lock submission. Del Rio continued feuding with Swagger on the April 1 episode of Raw, defeating Swagger's manager Zeb Colter via disqualification after Colter hit Del Rio with Ricardo Rodriguez's crutch. On April 7 at WrestleMania 29, Del Rio defeated Swagger via submission to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. The next night on Raw, Del Rio defeated Swagger and Zeb Colter in a Two-on-one handicap match after forcing Swagger to submit to the cross armbreaker. After that, Del Rio lost the World Heavyweight Champion to Dolph Ziggler who cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase, ending his reign at 90 days. After the loss of the World Heavyweight Title, Del Rio would continue feud with Swagger and Ziggler over the title. On the April 29 episode of Raw, Ricardo Rodriguez defeated Big E Langston and Zeb Colter in a three-way match to give Del Rio the right to choose the stipulation of his three-way match at Extreme Rules and chose a ladder match. However, Ziggler would suffer a legitimate concussion at a SmackDown taping, thus removing their match from Extreme Rules. In result of Ziggler's injury, Del Rio instead would be booked to face Swagger in a number one contender [...] "I Quit" [...] match at the pay-per-view on May 19, which Del Rio won. In the following weeks, Del Rio would face Ziggler's enforcer Big E. Langston in a series of matches, which Del Rio won 3-2.|$|E
