5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} were twofold. First, to evaluate in a community sample the age of onset <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> {{adolescents and young adults}} with and without parental major depression. Second, to examine whether specific clinical characteristics <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> adolescents and young adults are associated with elevated rates <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> among parents. Baseline and 4 -year follow-up data were used from the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology Study (EDSP), a prospective-longitudinal community study of adolescents and young adults. Results are based on 470 subjects who completed the follow-up, for whom diagnostic information for both parents was available, and who reported at least one episode <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> according to DSM-IV-criteria through second follow-up. Diagnostic assessment in respondents was accomplished by using the standardized Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI). Information on major <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> parents was collected as family history information from the respondents, and additionally from M-CIDI diagnostic interviews with parents of the younger cohort. Both recurrence and impairment as clinical characteristics <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> adolescents and young adults were associated with elevated rates <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> among parents. Age of onset as well as overall higher impairment as clinical characteristics <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> youth were associated with elevated rates <b>of</b> parental major <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> the univariate, but not in the multiple, analyses. Our findings suggest that clinical features <b>of</b> major <b>depression</b> may indicate familial subtypes of the disorder, most evident for recurrence and impairment.

25|$|Sertraline {{used for}} the {{treatment}} <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> elderly (older than 60) patients was superior to placebo and comparable to another SSRI fluoxetine, and TCAs amitriptyline, nortriptyline (Pamelor) and imipramine.

In addition, sertraline appeared to be more effective than fluoxetine or nortriptyline in the older-than-70 subgroup. A 2003 trial of sertraline vs. placebo in elderly patients showed a statistically significant (that is, unlikely to occur by chance), but clinically very modest improvement in depression and no improvement in quality of life.|$|E

40|$|<b>Depression</b> <b>in</b> {{pregnancy}} {{is a common}} psychiatric disorder affecting health of both {{the mother and the}} unborn child. The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and depressive symptoms during pregnancy ranges from 12 % to 36 %. Genetic, psychological, biological, environmental and hormonal factors comprise the predisposing factors for development <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>in</b> pregnancy may cause such pregnancy and obstetrical complications as preterm delivery, preeclampsia, difficult birth, increased need for surgical intervention during delivery, smaller fetus compared to the gestational age, newborns with low birth weights and low apgar scores. It is also important due to its potential to increase the risk of suicide attempts and postpartum depression. Depression seen at an early period of the pregnancy affects both the mother and the fetus negatively in the long run. Therefore, early diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> and its treatment will decrease the prospective risks for both parts. Health care staff {{play a key role in}} the early detection of the risk groups inclined to the gestational <b>depression,</b> <b>in</b> the prevention and treatment <b>of</b> <b>depression.</b> With the present work, we aimed at revising the diagnosis <b>of</b> the <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> pregnancy, its prevalence, risk factors for mother and fetus, its prevention and treatment during pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|The {{surface runoff}} process in fluvial/pluvial flood {{modelling}} is often simulated employing a two-dimensional (2 -D) diffusive wave approximation described by grid based digital elevation models (DEMs). However, this approach may cause potential problems {{when using the}} 2 -D surface flow model which exchanges flows through adjacent cells, with conventional sink removal algorithms which also allow for flow exchange along diagonal directions, due to the existence <b>of</b> artificial <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> DEMs. In this paper, we propose an effective method for filling artificial <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> DEM so that the problem can be addressed. We firstly analyse two types <b>of</b> <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> DEMs and demonstrate the issues caused by the current depression filling algorithms using the surface flow simulations from the MIKE SHE model built for a medium-sized basin in Southeast England. The proposed depression-filling algorithm for 2 -D overland flow modelling is applied and evaluated by comparing the simulated flows at the outlet of the catchment represented by DEMs at various resolutions (50 m, 100 m and 200 m). The {{results suggest that the}} existence <b>of</b> <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> DEMs can substantially influence the overland flow estimation and the new depression filling algorithm is shown to be effective in tackling this issue based upon the comparison of simulations for sink-dominated and sink-free DEMs, especially in the areas with relatively flat topography...|$|R

25|$|In {{looking at}} the issue of {{antidepressant}} use, some academics have highlighted the need to examine the use of antidepressants and other medical treatments in cross-cultural terms, {{due to the fact}} that various cultures prescribe and observe different manifestations, symptoms, meanings and associations of depression and other medical conditions within their populations. These cross-cultural discrepancies, it has been argued, then have implications on the perceived efficacy and use of antidepressants and other strategies in the treatment <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> these different cultures. In India antidepressants are largely seen as tools to combat marginality, promising the individual the ability to re-integrate into society through their use—a view and association not observed in the West.|$|E
25|$|Until 2002, {{sertraline}} {{was only}} approved {{for use in}} adults ages 18 and over; that year, it {{was approved by the}} FDA for use in treating children aged 6 or older with severe OCD.

However, sertraline can still be used in the UK for the treatment of OCD in children and adolescents. In 2005, the FDA added a boxed warning concerning pediatric suicidal behavior to all antidepressants, including sertraline. In 2007, labeling was again changed to add a warning regarding suicidal behavior in young adults ages 18 to 24.|$|E
25|$|Oxytocin {{produces}} antidepressant-like {{effects in}} animal models of depression, and {{a deficit of}} it {{may be involved in}} the pathophysiology <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> humans. The antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin are not blocked by a selective antagonist of the oxytocin receptor, suggesting that these effects are not mediated by the oxytocin receptor. In accordance, unlike oxytocin, the selective non-peptide oxytocin receptor agonist WAY-267,464 does not produce antidepressant-like effects, at least in the tail suspension test. In contrast to WAY-267,464, carbetocin, a close analogue of oxytocin and peptide oxytocin receptor agonist, notably does produce antidepressant-like effects in animals. As such, the antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin may be mediated by modulation of a different target, perhaps the vasopressin V1A receptor where oxytocin is known to weakly bind as an agonist.|$|E

25|$|Ingesting a {{compound}} by smoking {{is one of}} the most rapid and efficient methods of introducing it into the bloodstream, second only to injection, which allows for the rapid feedback which supports the smokers' ability to titrate their dosage. On average it takes about ten seconds for the substance to reach the brain. As a result of the efficiency of this delivery system, many smokers feel as though they are unable to cease. Of those who attempt cessation and last three months without succumbing to nicotine, most are able to remain smoke-free for the rest of their lives. There exists a possibility <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> some who attempt cessation, as with other psychoactive substances. Depression is also common in teenage smokers; teens who smoke are four times as likely to develop depressive symptoms as their nonsmoking peers.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, it is {{estimated}} that this condition afflicts as many as 200,000 Americans, but fewer than 50,000 are diagnosed. It is as widespread as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis and more prevalent than cystic fibrosis, but it is less well known. Narcolepsy is often mistaken for depression, epilepsy, or the side effects of medications. It can also be mistaken for poor sleeping habits, recreational drug use, or laziness. Narcolepsy can occur in both men and women at any age, although its symptoms are usually first noticed in teenagers or young adults. There is strong evidence that narcolepsy may run in families; around 10 percent of people diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy have a close relative with this neurological disorder. While narcolepsy symptoms are often confused with depression, there is a link between the two disorders. Research studies have mixed results on co-occurrence <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> narcolepsy patients - the numbers quoted by different studies are anywhere between 6% and 50%.|$|E
25|$|The era {{since the}} 1980s flourished, in large part, because of {{contributions}} {{made in the}} 1970s, a decade during which child psychiatry witnessed a major evolution {{as a result of}} the work carried out by Michael Rutter. The first comprehensive population survey of 9- to 11-year-olds, carried out in London and the Isle of Wight, which appeared in 1970, addressed questions that have continued to be of importance for child psychiatry; for example, rates of psychiatric disorders, the role of intellectual development and physical impairment, and specific concern for potential social influences on children's adjustment. This work was influential, especially since the investigators demonstrated specific continuities of psychopathology over time, and the influence of social and contextual factors in children's mental health, in their subsequent re-evaluation of the original cohort of children. These studies described the prevalence of ADHD (relatively low as compared to the US), identified the onset and prevalence <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> <b>in</b> mid-adolescence and the frequent co-morbidity with conduct disorder, and explored the relationship between various mental disorders and scholastic achievemment.|$|E
