5|$|The First Lady of the United States is {{the hostess}} of the White House.

The First Lady is not an elected position; it carries no official duties and receives no salary. Nonetheless, she attends many official ceremonies and functions of state either along with or in place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> Traditionally, the First Lady does not hold outside employment while occupying the office. She has her own staff, including the White House Social Secretary, the Chief of Staff, the Press Secretary, the Chief Floral Designer, and the Executive Chef.

5|$|Another issue {{concerned}} the election <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> Few agreed with Madison that the executive should be {{elected by the}} legislature. There was widespread concern with direct election, because information diffused so slowly in the late 18th century, and because of concerns that people would only vote for candidates from their state or region. A vocal minority wanted the national executive to be chosen by the governors of the states.|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} decision-theoretic model {{to explain how}} {{cabinets}} help presidents implement their policy-making strategies. Presidents are assumed to have two policy-making strategies: a strategy based on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> statutes or a strategy based on executive prerogatives. If <b>the</b> <b>president’s</b> preferences and <b>the</b> institutional incentives and economic conditions faced favor a statutory strat-egy, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> {{is more likely to}} appoint a majority cabinet, select more par-tisan ministers, and distribute portfolios to parties on a proportional basis. Econometric analysis of 106 cabinets appointed in 13 countries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ameri-cas demonstrates that <b>the</b> determinants <b>of</b> cabinet legislative status are <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>president’s</b> party, extremist presidents, and economic crises. <b>The</b> share <b>of</b> partisan ministers and proportionality in portfolio allocation are affected by <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>president’s</b> party, extremist presidents holding decree powers, <b>the</b> extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>president’s</b> veto powers, and <b>the</b> elapsing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>president’s</b> term...|$|R
