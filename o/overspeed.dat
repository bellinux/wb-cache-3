25|$|Electrical {{boosting}} ("E-boosting") is a {{new technology}} under development. It uses an electric motor to bring the turbocharger up to operating speed quicker than possible using available exhaust gases. An alternative to e-boosting is to completely separate the turbine and compressor into a turbine-generator and electric-compressor as in the hybrid turbocharger. This makes compressor speed independent of turbine speed. In 1981, a similar system that used a hydraulic drive system and <b>overspeed</b> clutch arrangement accelerated the turbocharger of the MV Canadian Pioneer (Doxford 76J4CR engine).|$|E

25|$|The Mirage IV {{is powered}} by two SNECMA Atar turbojets, fed by two air intakes {{on either side of}} the {{fuselage}} that had intake half-cone shock diffusers, known as souris ("mice"), which were moved forward as speed increased to trim the inlet for the shock wave angle. It can reach high supersonic speeds: the aircraft is redlined at Mach 2.2 at altitude because of airframe temperature restrictions, although it is capable of higher speeds. While broadly similar to the model used on the Mirage III, the Atar engine had a greater airflow and an elevated <b>overspeed</b> limit from 8,400 rpm to 8700 rpm for greater thrust during high altitude supersonic flight. While the first Mirage IV prototype was fitted with double-eyelid engine nozzles, production aircraft featured a complicated variable geometry nozzle that automatically varied in response to the descent rate and airspeed.|$|E
500|$|In {{the twelve}} seconds between brake {{application}} and brake release, the train {{passed over the}} fixed AWS magnet for signal SN43, which was displaying a single yellow (caution) aspect. This warning was cancelled in time. The train then passed over the TPWS+ <b>overspeed</b> sensor for signal SN45, which was displaying a red (danger) aspect. As the train was travelling more slowly than the trigger speed, no brake action was demanded from the train. The train then passed over the second TPWS <b>overspeed</b> sensor for signal SN45, this time at , which was {{in excess of the}} [...] trigger speed. Consequently, a TPWS intervention occurred, but as the AWS isolating cock was open the brakes did not apply. When the driver saw that signal SN45 was at danger, he applied the brakes on the train.
