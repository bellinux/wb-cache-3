He also holds the 11th position in the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> <b>Precedence</b> of India.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers and}} {{prestige}} {{of the prime minister}} have varied through the years. Pham Van Dong, Vietnam's second prime minister, often lamented that in practice he had little power. Since the death of Pham Hung in 1988, the prime minister has been ranked 3rd in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> of the Communist Party's Politburo, the highest decision-making body in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Royal Canadian Sea Cadets and Royal Canadian Army Cadets, they form the Canadian Cadet Organizations. Though the cadet {{programs}} {{have a close}} relationship with the CF, cadets are not members of the Forces, and are not expected or required to join the Canadian Forces. In keeping with Commonwealth custom, the Royal Canadian Air Cadets stand last in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence,</b> after the Royal Canadian Sea and Army Cadets.|$|E

50|$|The term is {{sometimes}} {{confused with the}} collective body of diplomats from a particular country - the proper term for which is diplomatic service. The diplomatic corps is not always given any formal recognition by its host country, but can be referenced by official <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence.</b>|$|R
5|$|At a 2006 {{conference on}} Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, {{an expert on}} Canada's honours, raised the concern that the three grades of the Order of Canada were {{insufficient}} to recognize the nation's very best; one suggestion was to add two more levels to the order, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders. The <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels {{of each of the}} other orders (except the Order of Merit), contrary to international practice.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, it {{provided}} an escort to the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) through the Savernake Forest, {{in recognition of}} which {{it was the first}} regiment in the British Army to be awarded the title of 'Prince of Wales's Own' (entitling it to wear the Prince of Wales's feathers as a badge). In 1884, it was placed {{at the head of the}} newly formed Yeomanry <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> <b>Precedence</b> by Queen Victoria.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} {{conflict}} between commemorations (for example, November 11 with St. Martin of Tours and Søren Kierkegaard), there is no <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence,</b> and individual worship planners need to choose which commemoration, if any, to highlight. In some cases, several individuals are listed together (June 14 with St. Basil the Great, St. Gregory the Theologian, and St. Gregory of Nyssa) because of their close association with each other, and they are thus designed to be commemorated jointly, not as a choice between one or the other.|$|E
50|$|What follows are {{the general}} <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> for {{different}} countries for state purposes, such as diplomatic dinners, and are made {{under the assumption}} that such functions are held in the capital. When they are held in another city or region, local officials such as governors would be much higher up the order. There may also be more specific and local <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence,</b> for particular occasions or within particular institutions. Universities and the professions often have their own rules <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> applying locally, based (for example) on university or professional rank, each rank then being ordered within itself on the basis of seniority (i.e. date of attaining that rank). Within an institution the officials of that institution are likely to rank much higher in the order than in a general <b>order</b> <b>of</b> precedence—the chancellor or president of a university may well precede anyone except a head of state for example. The same might be true for a mayor {{in his or her own}} city.|$|R
50|$|The Great Houses are {{as follows}} (in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> their <b>precedence</b> in the cycle), with their two primary {{representative}} characteristics.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> in the People's Republic of China is {{the ranking}} of {{political}} leaders in China, by <b>order</b> <b>of</b> presumed political power. Although there is no formally published ranking, there is usually an established convention and protocol, and the relative positions of Chinese political figures can usually be deduced from the order in meetings and especially by the time and order in which figures are covered by the official media.|$|R
5|$|Joint Secretaries in the Union Government is {{analogous}} to Major-General and equivalent ranks in Indian Armed Forces and are listed as such in the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> <b>Precedence.</b> In the Cabinet Secretariat, the Military wing is headed by an officer {{from one of the}} three services with the rank of Major General and equivalent is given the status of this rank and is designated as Joint Secretary (Military) in the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
5|$|Reception for {{the medal}} was mixed, with {{veterans}} criticizing {{the placement of}} the medal in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence.</b> Production of the medal was halted on 12 March 2013, pending a review of its precedence as ordered by Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel. It was subsequently cancelled by Secretary Hagel on 15 April 2013 who made the decision to instead create and offer a new distinguishing device to existing medals. On January 8, 2016, the DoD presented two new award devices.|$|E
5|$|Judges in a High Court are {{appointed}} by the President of India {{in consultation with the}} Chief Justice of India and the governor of the state. High Courts are headed by a Chief Justice. The Chief Justices are ranked fourteenth (in their state) and seventeenth (outside their state) in the Indian <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence.</b> The number of judges in a court is decided by dividing the average institution of main cases during the last five years by the national average, or the average rate of disposal of main cases per judge per year in that High Court, whichever is higher.|$|E
50|$|Only one medal is conferred and, {{for each}} {{additional}} period of ten years of qualifying service {{to a maximum of}} another forty years, altogether four bars may be awarded to denote subsequent conferments of the medal. The position of the Medalje vir Troue Diens - Medal for Loyal Service in the official military and national <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> depends on which bars for further periods of service beyond ten years, if any, had been awarded to the recipient.|$|R
50|$|Orders, decorations and medals {{earned by}} Germans before the Nazi {{assumption}} of power {{continued to be}} worn and were incorporated into the prescribed <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> and uniform regulations for the German armed forces and civil organisations in Germany. These included awards of Imperial Germany and its members states (Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, etc.), awards of the Weimar Republic and awards of Austro-Hungary (after the 1938 annexation, Austrian awards were treated as another class of state award like Prussian and Bavarian).|$|R
50|$|The Department of Canadian Heritage {{issues a}} Table <b>of</b> <b>Precedence</b> for Canada, {{which does not}} include members of the Royal Family, save for the sovereign, {{mentioned}} in a note as preceding the governor general. The Department of National Defence issues near identical guidelines, with the primary difference being the inclusion {{of members of the}} Canadian Royal Family, specifying that they take precedence after the governor general. The provinces and territories of Canada also have their own <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> for events <b>of</b> a provincial or territorial nature. They serve the same purpose and are structured similarly, but place an emphasis on provincial or territorial offices.|$|R
5|$|Northern Laos, however, was {{not going}} to be a {{priority}} for the Americans. It was decided at the Honolulu Executive Conference of April 1965 that U.S. aircraft could be used for interdiction in Laos only after close air support needs were met in South Vietnam. General Westmoreland was also granted veto power over bombing, interdiction, and reconnaissance programs outside territorial South Vietnam. That decision placed Barrel Roll behind South Vietnam, Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence.</b> Only an estimated two percent of the total U.S. aerial effort in Southeast Asia was going to be utilized in northern Laos.|$|E
5|$|The president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier (19 March 2017–present), is {{the head}} of state and {{invested}} primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the Bundesversammlung (federal convention), an institution consisting {{of the members of the}} Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates. The second-highest official in the German <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> is the Bundestagspräsident (President of the Bundestag), who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body. The third-highest official and the head of government is the Chancellor, who is appointed by the Bundespräsident after being elected by the Bundestag.|$|E
5|$|Members are {{assigned}} {{positions in the}} <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence,</b> coming before all others of knightly rank, and above baronets. The wives, sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of Knights Companion are also assigned precedence. Relatives of Ladies Companion are not, however, assigned any special positions. (Generally, individuals can derive precedence from their fathers or husbands, but not from their mothers or wives.) The Chancellor is also assigned precedence, but except for the period between 1553 and 1671 when the office was held by a layman who was not necessarily {{a member of the}} Order, this precedence has been purely theoretical. As a member of the Order, the Chancellor has a higher precedence than that attached to the office, and when the office was filled by a diocesan bishop of the Church of England, the holder again had a higher precedence by virtue of that office than any that the chancellorship could bestow.|$|E
50|$|The 21st century United States Army {{issues the}} {{following}} military badges (listed below in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> group <b>precedence)</b> which are worn {{in conjunction with}} badges of rank and branch insignia.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, some {{international}} organizations, {{such as the}} Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, or the European Union, have designated their Permanent Representatives in third countries as Ambassadors, although they do not represent sovereign entities. This is now largely accepted, and because these Ambassadors rank after the UN representative in the <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>precedence</b> <b>of</b> representatives of international organizations, the UN coming naturally first as pre-eminent, the UN Resident Coordinators are now also commonly but informally referred to in diplomatic circles as ambassadors, although the UN itself does not refer to them in this way.|$|R
50|$|The body-guard of Catherine the Great, {{as well as}} {{the main}} {{supporter}} of her bloodless coup against her husband Peter III, this regiment was declared the highest in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> military <b>precedence</b> from 14 July 1762.|$|R
