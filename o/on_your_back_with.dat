6000|$|... "You are {{certainly}} run down," [...] said Dick, [...] "and unless you take extra {{good care of}} yourself you'll be flat <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> some serious illness. But the question still is, Dan, What are we to do with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Narvous {{you well}} may be, Susan, and you slavin' for forty boarders, with {{transitory}} meals for travellers, and nobody to help you. If you was flat <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> rheumatiz, ez you well might be, perhaps {{you might get}} a hand. A death in the family might be of sarvice to you in callin' round you friends az couldn't otherwise leave their business. That cough that little Manty had on to her for the last five weeks would frighten some mothers into a narvous consumption." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And you awoke, {{and found}} you were lying <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back,</b> or <b>with</b> <b>your</b> head {{hanging over the}} bedside, or {{suffering}} some pain from indigestion?' said Ralph. 'Pshaw, Mr Bray! Do as I do (you will have the opportunity, now that a constant round of pleasure and enjoyment opens upon you), and, occupying yourself a little more by day, {{have no time to}} think of what you dream by night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{the people}} {{may very well}} say 'save me from my friends'," [...] Fardell answered, grimly. [...] "Mind, I believe you're honest, or you'd be lying <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> now <b>with</b> a cracked skull. But you are using a great {{influence}} on the wrong side. You're standing between {{the people and the}} one reasonable scheme which has been brought forward which has a fair chance of changing their condition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said she, very scornfully, [...] "neither are you {{strong enough}} to pull King Pelias off his throne. And, Jason, unless you will help an old woman at her need, you {{ought not to be}} a king. What are kings made for, save to succor the feeble and distressed? But do as you please. Either take me <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back,</b> or <b>with</b> my poor old limbs I shall try my best to {{struggle}} across the stream." ...|$|R
60|$|I am grieved to {{say that}} on Saturday I stand engaged to dine, at three weeks' notice, with one ----, {{a man who has}} read every book that ever was written, and is a perfect gulf of information. Before {{exploding}} a mine of knowledge he has a habit of closing one eye and wrinkling up his nose, so that he seems perpetually to be taking aim at you and knocking you over with a terrific charge. Then he looks again, and takes another aim. So you are always <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> your legs in the air.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a funny}} bath. We {{could not}} sink. One could stretch himself at full length on his back, with his arms on his breast, {{and all of his}} body above a line drawn {{from the corner of his}} jaw past the middle of his side, the middle of his leg and through his ancle bone, would remain out of water. He could lift his head clear out, if he chose. No {{position}} can be retained long; you lose your balance and whirl over, first on your back and then on your face, and so on. You can lie comfortably, <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> your head out, and your legs out from your knees down, by steadying yourself with your hands. You can sit, with your knees drawn up to your chin and your arms clasped around them, but you are bound to turn over presently, because you are top-heavy in that position. You can stand up straight in water that is over your head, and from the middle of your breast upward you will not be wet. But you can not remain so. The water will soon float your feet to the surface. You can not swim on your back and make any progress of any consequence, because your feet stick away above the surface, and there is nothing to propel yourself with but your heels. If you swim on your face, you kick up the water like a stern-wheel boat. You make no headway. A horse is so top-heavy that he can neither swim nor stand up in the Dead Sea. He turns over on his side at once. Some of us bathed for more than an hour, and then came out coated with salt till we shone like icicles. We scrubbed it off with a coarse towel and rode off with a splendid brand-new smell, though it was one which was not any more disagreeable than those we have been for several weeks enjoying. It was the variegated villainy and novelty of it that charmed us. Salt crystals glitter in the sun about the shores of the lake. In places they coat the ground like a brilliant crust of ice.|$|E

6000|$|... "Jeffrey," [...] he went on, [...] "I have {{papers on}} me {{that should not be}} lost, for with them might go my girl's heritage. Take them," [...] and he thrust a packet into his hand, [...] "and this purse also. There's plenty in it. Away--anywhere, and lie hid out of reach a while, or they'll still your tongue. Then I charge you <b>on</b> <b>your</b> soul, come <b>back</b> <b>with</b> help and hang that knave Abbot--for your Lady's sake, Jeffrey. She'll reward you, and so will God above." ...|$|R
5000|$|Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan {{recorded}} [...] "You're Gonna Need Somebody <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> Bond" [...] {{in early}} 1965 for inclusion on his debut album What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid. Since Donovan recorded {{a version of}} [...] "Universal Soldier" [...] after hearing it on Buffy Sainte-Marie's debut album, {{it is likely that}} he first heard [...] "You're Gonna Need Somebody <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> Bond" [...] from the same source. Hickory Records released [...] "You're Gonna Need Somebody <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> Bond" [...] <b>backed</b> <b>with</b> a cover of [...] "The Little Tin Soldier" [...] by Shawn Phillips in November 1965 (Hickory 45-1375), but it did not appear in the single charts.|$|R
5000|$|After being {{signed with}} the help of Fred Rose to Sterling Records, Williams {{assisted}} his debut recording session on December 11, 1946 at Castle Recording Company's studio D in Nashville, Tennessee. The singer cut four songs, returning later on February 13, 1947 to cut four new sides. His first single, [...] "Never Again (Will I Knock <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> Door)" [...] <b>backed</b> <b>with</b> [...] "Calling You" [...] was released in January 1947.Not satisfied with Sterling, and upon learning of the creation of MGM Records by the Loews Corporation, Fred Rose negotiated a deal for Williams. Rose bought the Sterling masters, became Williams' manager and signed him to the label, agreeing to record all of his sessions in Nashville. By June 1947, Williams debuted on the MGM label with [...] "Move it On Over" [...] <b>backed</b> <b>with</b> [...] "(Last Night) I Heard You Crying in Your Sleep". The release quickly became a hit.|$|R

5000|$|The Sit-Up: [...] "The sit-up event {{measures}} the endurance of the abdominal and hip-flexor muscles. On the command [...] "get set," [...] assume {{the starting position}} by lying <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> your knees bent at a 45- degree angle. Your feet may be together or up to 12 inches apart. Another person will hold your ankles with the hands only. No other method of bracing or holding the feet is authorized. The heel is {{the only part of}} your foot that must stay in contact with the ground. Your fingers must be interlocked behind your head and the backs of your hands must touch the ground. Your arms and elbows need not touch the ground. On the command [...] "go," [...] begin raising your upper body forward to, or beyond, the vertical position. The vertical position means that the base of your neck is above the base of your spine. After you have reached or surpassed the vertical position, lower your body until the bottom of your shoulder blades touch the ground. Your head, hands, arms, or elbows do not have to touch the ground. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state the number of sit-ups you have correctly completed. A repetition will not count if you fail to reach the vertical position, fail to keep your fingers interlocked behind your head, arch or bow your back and raise your buttocks off the ground to raise your upper body, or let your knees exceed a 90-degree angle. If a repetition does not count, the scorer will repeat the number of your last correctly performed sit-up. The up position is the only authorized rest position. If you stop and rest in the down (starting) position, the event will be terminated. As long as you make a continuous physical effort to sit up, the event will not be terminated. You may not use your hands or any other means to pull or push yourself up to the up (resting) position or to hold yourself in the rest position. If you do so, your performance in the event will be terminated. Correct performance is important. You will have two minutes to perform as many sit-ups as you can.".|$|E
