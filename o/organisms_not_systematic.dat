5000|$|We want to {{transform}} the whole <b>organism,</b> <b>not</b> just one cell. This is done by transforming plant cells in culture, selecting transformed cells and regenerating an entire plant from the transformed cell (e.g. tobacco) ...|$|R

50|$|In Puget Sound, Washington, aggregations {{of up to}} 3,500 {{tubes of}} Neosabellaria cementarium per square metre at depths of between 15 and 40 m were found to provide a habitat to a diverse range of other <b>organisms</b> <b>not</b> found in {{adjacent}} areas.|$|R
5000|$|In common use, a {{catchall}} or catch-all is {{a general}} term, or metaphoric dumping group, {{for a variety of}} similar words or meanings. For instance, a catch-all taxon a.k.a. [...] "wastebasket taxon" [...] is a grouping of <b>organisms</b> <b>not</b> fitting anywhere else.|$|R

25|$|The {{biometric}} school, led by Karl Pearson and Walter Weldon. They argued vigorously against mutationism, {{saying that}} empirical evidence indicated that variation was continuous in most <b>organisms,</b> <b>not</b> discrete as Mendelism seemed to predict; they wrongly believed that Mendelism inevitably implied evolution in discontinuous jumps.|$|R

40|$|What causes sterile pyuria? Evidence-Based Answer: Sterile pyuria can {{be caused}} by {{atypical}} <b>organisms</b> <b>not</b> found on routine culture (18 % of cases) or as part of systemic illness, such as lupus. General categories of etiology include infectious and systemic diseases, structural problems, and drugs (SOR: B, observational studies) ...|$|R
50|$|Negligible {{senescence}} is {{the lack}} of symptoms of aging in some organisms. Negligibly senescent <b>organisms</b> do <b>not</b> have measurable reductions in their reproductive capability with age, or measurable functional decline with age. Death rates in negligibly senescent <b>organisms</b> do <b>not</b> increase with age as they do in senescent organisms.|$|R
5000|$|The Acts {{evidence}} Congress' understanding, {{at least}} since 1930, that 101 does <b>not</b> include living <b>organisms.</b> If newly developed living <b>organisms</b> <b>not</b> naturally occurring had been patentable under 101, the plants included in {{the scope of the}} 1930 and 1970 Acts could have been patented without new legislation.|$|R

25|$|This {{level of}} {{biosafety}} {{is appropriate for}} work with several kinds of microorganisms including non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other <b>organisms</b> <b>not</b> suspected to contribute to human disease. Due to the relative ease and safety of maintaining a BSL-1 laboratory, these are the types of laboratories generally used as teaching spaces for high schools and colleges.|$|R
50|$|A {{second type}} of food testing strip is a gram-negative swab, which is usually {{administered}} directly to the food itself. Gram-negative swabs generally work faster than enzyme reactant strips, but they differ in that the gram-negative swabs are designed to detect a broad group of <b>organisms,</b> <b>not</b> just those that can cause foodborne illness in humans.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, biosystems {{engineering}} {{is a field}} of engineering which integrates engineering science and design with applied biological and environmental sciences. It represents an evolution of engineering disciplines applied to all living <b>organisms</b> <b>not</b> including biomedical applications. Therefore, biosystems {{engineering is}} 'the branch of engineering that applies engineering sciences to solve problems involving biological systems' (according to Erabee Network).|$|R

5|$|As {{with all}} parts of Quenya grammar, the pronominal system was subject to many {{revisions}} throughout Tolkien's life, and the available corpus was <b>not</b> <b>systematic</b> until a list of endings was published in Vinyar Tengwar No. 49 in 2007.
