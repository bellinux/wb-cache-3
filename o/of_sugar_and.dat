The high winds destroyed large areas <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> soybean crops, estimated at $289million in damage. Strong winds also left at least 230,000people without electricity. During the storm's passage, upwelling occurred in the Atchafalaya Basin and Bayou Lafourche, killing 187million freshwater fish. Damage to the fishing industry was estimated at $266million. Overall, losses {{in the state of}} Louisiana reached approximately $1.56billion. A total of 17deaths occurred in Louisiana, 8directly and 9from indirect causes.

5|$|Riesling is a {{versatile}} wine for pairing with food, {{because of its}} balance <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> acidity.

A Riesling's typical aromas are of flowers, tropical fruits, and mineral stone (such as slate or quartz), although, with time, the wine acquires a petrol note as mentioned above.|$|E

5|$|English tastes evolved {{during the}} sixteenth century {{in at least three}} ways. Firstly, recipes emphasise a balance of sweet and sour. Secondly, butter becomes an {{important}} ingredient in sauces, a trend which continued in later centuries. Thirdly, herbs, which could be grown locally but had been little used in the Middle Ages, started to replace spices as flavourings. In A. W.'s Book of Cookrye, 35% of the recipes for meat stews and sauces include herbs, most commonly thyme. On the other hand, 76% of those meat recipes still used the distinctly mediaeval combination <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> dried fruit, together or separately. New ingredients were arriving from distant countries, too: The Good Huswifes Jewell introduced sweet potatoes alongside familiar Medieval recipes.|$|E
5|$|Magnapop {{have been}} defined genre-wise as power pop by {{multiple}} rock critics, and their performances have drawn comparisons with punk, new wave, and surf rock. Reviewers have {{commented on the}} band's pop-influenced songwriting, specifically their employment of guitar hooks and simple chord structure. To that end, they have been compared to Mould's previous work as a member <b>of</b> <b>Sugar</b> <b>and</b> Hüsker Dü, as well as fellow Georgia-based rock acts such as Guadalcanal Diary and Let's Active and alternative rock pioneers Pixies and The Replacements. The album Rubbing Doesn't Help represented a stylistic shift for the band away from their more pop-inspired material toward more guitar-oriented rock, but their comeback with Mouthfeel returned to the more pop-inspired sound of Hot Boxing.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with a free}} plot {{of land in the}} United Kingdom and {{few hundred}} {{thousand}} pounds, the player must build a profitable amusement park. Money is spent on building rides, shops, and staff, and earned through sale of entry tickets, merchandise, and refreshments. Shops available include those selling foodstuff (such as ice creams) or soft drinks, and games such as coconut shies and arcades. Their attributes can be customised, which may affect customers' behaviour: for example, affecting the flavour of foods (e.g. by altering the amount <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> ice cream contains) may affect customers' enticements to return. Facilities such as toilets, and items that enhance the park's scenery (such as trees and fountains) can be purchased. Over thirty attractions, ranging in complexity from the bouncy castle and tree house to more complicated and expensive rides such as the roller coaster and Ferris wheel are available. Also available as rides are shows (called 'acts') with themes such as clowns and mediaeval. Certain rides, such as roller coasters, require a track to be laid out. The ride complement varies between platforms: for example, the PlayStation version is missing the mediaeval and dolphin shows. Rides require regular maintenance: if neglected for too long they will explode. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour the park or the rides.|$|E
