The most important factor out of four, which can persuade the customer's online buying decision, is delivery cost for purchased items and it has negative relationship with dependent variable, moreover perceived risk has also negative relationship with dependent one. Perceived convenience and Perceived enjoyment has positive relationship with <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> preference.

Social media is also becoming a widespread tool, {{not only for}} interaction with others but also for marketing. Despite this trend, there is a dearth {{of knowledge about the}} acceptance of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> and the use of social media in developing countries such as Saudi Arabia. Technology adoption levels in Saudi Arabia are growing rapidly but have yet to reach their full potential. One of the leading theories explaining <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> behaviour – the <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> acceptance model (OSAM) – has not been employed in previous studies of social media use or in developing countries such as Saudi Arabia to understand <b>online</b> <b>shopping.</b> To address this research problem, the researcher implemented a study using a positivist approach. Quantitative data was gathered using an online survey. This survey was conducted with Saudi residents who engage with <b>online</b> <b>shopping.</b> A data set of 423 completed survey responses is used in this thesis for statistical analysis. The data was collected using a random sample and was collected from January to September 2015. The structural equation modelling tested the hypothesised relationships between the constructs as postulated in the model. Nineteen of the hypothesised links were supported and ten were rejected. Eventually, the model that has statistical and explanatory power was confirmed. The findings indicate a positive relationship between <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> intention and other factors of online shopping acceptance in Saudi Arabia. A positive relationship is also seen between <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> orientation and <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> experience.

The same applies for the relationship between <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> and social media through the mediation of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> intention. This research contributes to understanding the role of social media in OSAM in Saudi Arabia as a developing country, as OSAM incorporates social media as a new factor that influences acceptance aside from what is traditionally stipulated. A second contribution is the finding that shopping orientation is the most important construct affecting <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> intention in Saudi Arabia...|$|R
