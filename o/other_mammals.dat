5|$|The {{brains of}} humans and other {{primates}} contain the same structures as the brains of <b>other</b> <b>mammals,</b> but are generally larger in proportion to body size. The encephalization quotient (EQ) is used to compare brain sizes across species. It {{takes into account the}} nonlinearity of the brain-to-body relationship. Humans have an average EQ in the 7-to-8 range, while most other primates have an EQ in the 2-to-3 range. Dolphins have values higher than those of primates other than humans, but nearly all <b>other</b> <b>mammals</b> have EQ values that are substantially lower.|$|E
5|$|Among scientists, he {{is perhaps}} best known for his work on the {{ligament}} which bears his name.

5|$|Habitats in Boise National Forest support nearly 300 {{terrestrial}} vertebrate {{species and}} 28 fish species. The most common large animals are mule deer and elk, but <b>other</b> <b>mammals</b> present include moose, black bears, cougar, coyote, yellow-bellied marmot, beaver, porcupine, Canadian lynx, mountain goat, pika, river otter, muskrat, pronghorn, mink, bobcat, marten, and timber wolves.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} {{cerebrospinal}} fluid varies by size and species. In humans and <b>other</b> <b>mammals,</b> cerebrospinal fluid, produced, circulating, and reabsorbed {{in a similar}} manner to humans, and with a similar function, turns over at a rate of 3–5 times a day. Problems with CSF circulation leading to hydrocephalus occur in other animals.|$|E
5|$|The forests were {{dominated}} by birds, {{and the lack of}} mammalian predators led to some like the kiwi, kakapo, weka and takahē evolving flightlessness. The arrival of humans, associated changes to habitat, and the introduction of rats, ferrets and <b>other</b> <b>mammals</b> led to the extinction of many bird species, including large birds like the moa and Haast's eagle.|$|E

5|$|The mammary glands {{of mammals}} are {{specialized}} to produce milk, {{the primary source}} of nutrition for newborns. The monotremes branched early from <b>other</b> <b>mammals</b> and do not have the nipples seen in most mammals, but they do have mammary glands. The young lick the milk from a mammary patch on the mother's belly.|$|E
5|$|A 1988 {{field study}} found that most flowers of B.serrata opened at night, and {{recorded}} the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus), and bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) as nocturnal mammalian visitors and pollinators. <b>Other</b> <b>mammals</b> recorded eating the flowers include the grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), little red flying fox (P. scapulatus) and common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis). Banksia serrata is a host plant for the larval and adult stages of the banksia jewel beetle (Cyrioides imperialis). Native bees and European honey bees visit the flowers.|$|E
5|$|A herd of elk was {{introduced}} to the watershed shortly before November 2000. Black bears have also been observed in the watershed. Coyotes live in the watershed, and have been hunted and trapped. <b>Other</b> <b>mammals</b> living in the watershed include gray squirrels, beavers, minks, bobcats, raccoons, and red and gray foxes. The Allegheny Wood Rat has the potential to inhabit much of the watershed except for the northwestern part.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} <b>other</b> <b>mammals,</b> {{including}} the cat-like fossa, are endemic to Madagascar. Over 300 {{species of birds}} have been recorded on the island, of which over 60percent (including four families and 42 genera) are endemic. The few families and genera of reptile that have reached Madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90percent of these being endemic (including one endemic family). The island is home to two-thirds of the world's chameleon species, including the smallest known, and researchers have proposed that Madagascar may be the origin of all chameleons.|$|E
5|$|Although {{far less}} common than other metallo{{proteins}} (e.g. those of zinc and iron), cobaltoproteins are known aside from B12. These proteins include methionine aminopeptidase 2, an enzyme {{that occurs in}} humans and <b>other</b> <b>mammals</b> that does not use the corrin ring of B12, but binds cobalt directly. Another non-corrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that metabolize nitriles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the eyes}} of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, no species is blind. Microbats have mesopic vision, meaning that they can only detect light in low levels, whereas <b>other</b> <b>mammals</b> have {{photopic}} vision, which allows colour vision. Microbats may use their vision for orientation and while they are travelling between their roosting grounds and their feeding grounds, as echolocation is only effective over short distances. Some species can detect ultraviolet (UV). As the bodies of some microbats have distinct coloration, {{they may be able}} to discriminate colours.|$|E
25|$|<b>Other</b> <b>mammal</b> remains {{include the}} broken tooth UA 8699, which as been {{interpreted}} both as metatherian and as eutherian, a non-gondwanathere multituberculate tooth fragment, and a yet undescribed mammal known from an articulated skeleton.|$|R
50|$|Non-mammalian {{vertebrate}} embryos {{depend on}} nutrients from the yolk sac. Humans and <b>other</b> <b>mammal</b> genomes contain broken, non-functioning genes that code {{for the production}} of yolk. alongside the presence of an empty yolk sac with the embryo.|$|R
50|$|<b>Other</b> <b>mammal</b> {{species are}} only {{occasional}} visitors. Remains of elephants, monkeys and bongo {{have been found}} high in the alpine zone, and other sightings are remembered in names such as Simba Tarn (simba means lion in Swahili).|$|R
5|$|Although {{the term}} lipid is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym for fats, fats are a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides. Lipids also encompass molecules such as fatty acids and their derivatives (including tri-, di-, monoglycerides, and phospholipids), {{as well as other}} sterol-containing metabolites such as cholesterol. Although humans and <b>other</b> <b>mammals</b> use various biosynthetic pathways both to break down and to synthesize lipids, some essential lipids cannot be made this way and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E
5|$|Ambondro mahabo was {{described}} {{from the middle}} Jurassic (Bathonian, about 167million years ago) of northwestern Madagascar in 1999. It is known from a single lower jaw fragment with three teeth, probably the last premolar and first two molars. The molars have been interpreted as showing the tribosphenic pattern that is characteristic of modern mammals; Ambondro is the oldest known mammal with such a pattern. This led its discoverers to propose that the ancestors of tribosphenic mammals arose in the south (Gondwana), not, as generally assumed, in the north (Laurasia). In 2001, however, paleontologist Zhe-Xi Luo and colleagues alternatively proposed that Ambondro {{was part of a}} clade with Ausktribosphenos from the Cretaceous of Australia and the monotremes that developed tribosphenicity independently from <b>other</b> <b>mammals</b> (Boreosphenida). This clade, Australosphenida, has since been expanded with more recently discovered species from Argentina (Asfaltomylos and Henosferus) and Australia (Bishops). Other paleontologists have disagreed with this interpretation and proposed different models; for example, in 2001 Denise Sigogneau-Russell and colleagues proposed that although Ausktribosphenos and monotremes were related, Ambondro was not and was in fact more similar to boreosphenidans, and in 2003 Michael Woodburne and colleagues excluded monotremes from Australosphenida and placed the remaining australosphenidans close to placentals. The deposits that produced Ambondro have yielded some reptiles, but no <b>other</b> <b>mammals.</b>|$|E
5|$|As with <b>other</b> <b>mammals,</b> {{domestic}} sheep reproduction occurs sexually. Their reproductive strategy {{is very similar}} to other domestic herd animals. A flock of sheep is generally mated by a single ram, which has either been chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams (in feral populations). Most sheep have a breeding season (tupping) in the autumn, though some are able to breed year-round.|$|E
50|$|A strong {{signal peptide}} {{detected}} in the mitochondrion region (0.788) suggests that the LENG9 protein localizes in the mitochondrial matrix. However, further analysis among <b>other</b> <b>mammal</b> orthologs predicted sub-cellular localization in the cytoplasm and nuclear localization for Danio rerio.|$|R
50|$|The largest (and type) species, A. mortoni was a cow-sized predator. Rhino {{jaws and}} <b>other</b> <b>mammal</b> bones {{have been found}} with bite marks on them that match the large canines of A. mortoni. A fossil {{trackway}} in Toadstool Geologic Park depicts {{the path of a}} Subhyracodon walking forward, stopping to see an Archaeotherium approach, then breaking into a gallop with the entelodont chasing after it. In leaner times, it is suggested that Archaeotherium dug for roots and tubers, as with <b>other</b> pig-like <b>mammals.</b>|$|R
5|$|Among many <b>other</b> <b>mammal</b> crosses are hybrid camels, crosses {{between a}} bactrian camel and a dromedary. The first known {{instance}} of hybrid speciation in marine mammals {{was discovered in}} 2014. The clymene dolphin (Stenella clymene) is a hybrid of two Atlantic species, the spinner and striped dolphins.|$|R
5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many <b>other</b> <b>mammals</b> use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Bats may avoid flying {{during the}} day to prevent {{overheating}} in the sun, since their dark wing-membranes absorb solar radiation. Bats {{may not be able}} to dissipate heat if the ambient temperature is too high. Unlike birds which have air sacs or <b>other</b> <b>mammals</b> which have sweat glands, bats have no means to cool themselves by evaporation, though they may use saliva to cool themselves in an emergency.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is {{considered}} to be a keystone species whose presence in the ecosystem maintains a healthy balance of organisms. In its absence, fish, such as piranhas, might dominate the environment. The eggs and newly hatched young of Cuvier's dwarf caiman are most at risk and are preyed on by birds, snakes, rats, raccoons and <b>other</b> <b>mammals.</b> Adult caimans are protected by the bony osteoderms under the scales and their main predators are jaguars, green anacondas (Eunectes murinus) and large boa constrictors (Boa constrictor).|$|E
