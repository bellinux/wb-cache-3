Today, teachers and students are gradually utilizing the net in education {{more and more and}} more frequently. Therefore, this study is a descriptive search as if aims to clarify the prospective teachers (at Pamukkale University Education Faculty) level of internet knowledge and use it. The sampling was performed through sampling group method among 780 prospective teachers. Meanwhile, the data obtained in this study was piled up through a specifically developed scale which had been built up in <b>optical</b> <b>reader</b> <b>form.</b> After these forms were filled in, they were scanned by the optic reader and the result obtained were analyzed through the program called SPSS 11. 5 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences).

Optical forms are evaluated by employing optical mark recognition techniques through <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> High cost of these machines, limited access to them, long waiting time for evaluation results make the process hard for educationists working in cities or countries.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} acquiring on-job performance evaluation marks for enlisted personnel is deficient in two important respects: (1) the scales do not adequately differentiate among actual levels of ratee performance, and (2) the manual forms and procedures do not per-mit timely processing {{and application of}} the data for important indi-vidual personnel actions (e. g., advancement, assignment, and quality retention). In 1968 the Navy began its transition from a manual to an auto-mated system, starting with {{the development and implementation}} of an <b>Optical</b> Mark <b>Reader</b> (OMR) document for the top three enlisted Pay Grades, E- 7 / 8 / 9. This report describes the development of new marking scales for two other Pay Grade groups, 5 - 6 and 1 - 4. Although automated processing equipment was used, the primary thrust of the project was on substantive, rather than hardware, considerations. The purpose was to reduce inflation of marks and to achieve greater differentiation of levels of performance among ratees by designing new formats tailored to the specific pay grade groups. B. Approach Alternative marking scales and coding procedures for each pay grade group were experimentally administered to a fleet sample.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comObjective: To describe oral health in the Anangu Pitjantjatjaraku lands in South Australia and to compare with earlier surveys and national data. Design: Descriptive. Setting: Data were collected {{at the time of}} dental care service provision, according to World Health Organization protocols, {{at the request of the}} Nganampa Health Council on <b>optical</b> mark <b>reader</b> <b>forms.</b> Participants: There were 356 Anangu adults and 317 children surveyed. Results: The mean number of teeth affected by dental caries in the deciduous dentition in young children, aged 5 – 6 years, was double (mean 3. 20) that of the overall Australian child population aged 5 – 6 years (mean 1. 44). In contrast to the decline in deciduous caries in Australian children generally, Anangu children aged 5 – 9 years had a 42 % increase in the mean number of teeth affected since 1987. Adults experienced low levels of dental caries, but severe periodontal disease was more prevalent among diabetics (79 %) compared with-non-diabetics (13. 8 %). Tooth loss was found more frequently among adults with diabetes (mean 5. 51) than non-diabetics (mean 1. 53). Conclusions: Oral health promotion strategies, in association with general health strategies, need to be developed to improve oral health in this remote Aboriginal population. What this paper adds: Recent studies have shown that oral health of Indigenous children is worsening, but there has been little documentation of the changing oral health status of Indigenous adults. This study notes the deterioration of oral health in both children and adults since 1987 / 88. The relationship between glycaemic control, periodontal diseases and tooth loss in Indigenous adult populations needs to be further investigated.

40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{prototype}} of an open source, <b>optical</b> fingerprint <b>reader,</b> called RaspiReader, using ubiquitous components. RaspiReader, a low-cost and easy to assemble reader, provides the fingerprint research community a seamless and simple method for gaining {{more control over the}} sensing component of fingerprint recognition systems. In particular, we posit that this versatile fingerprint reader will encourage researchers to explore novel spoof detection methods that integrate both hardware and software. RaspiReader's hardware is customized with two cameras for fingerprint acquisition with one camera providing high contrast, frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) images, and the other camera outputting direct images. Using both of these image streams, we extract complementary information which, when fused together, results in highly discriminative features for fingerprint spoof (presentation attack) detection. Our experimental results demonstrate a marked improvement over previous spoof detection methods which rely only on FTIR images provided by COTS <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> Finally, fingerprint matching experiments between images acquired from the FTIR output of the RaspiReader and images acquired from a COTS fingerprint reader verify the interoperability of the RaspiReader with existing COTS <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

To address this, a highly sensitive point-of-care fluorescence lateral flow immunoassay is being developed to diagnose dengue in its earliest stages. Through use of different fluorescent labels, multiplexed test strips will eventually be created to test for several diseases simultaneously. To quantify the resulting signals produced by the assay, a corresponding <b>optical</b> <b>reader</b> was designed, built, and tested in accordance with design thinking principles. The effectiveness of the design was verified through usability testing. The reader works in conjunction with software run on any internet-enabled device to take an image of a test strip and analyze the signal levels by comparing them to predetermined calibration curves. Through use of the fluorescence lateral flow immunoassay and corresponding <b>optical</b> <b>reader,</b> users in resource-limited settings can diagnose dengue rapidly and accurately. 2021 - 05 - 3...|$|R
40|$|We {{open source}} an easy to assemble, spoof resistant, high resolution, <b>optical</b> {{fingerprint}} <b>reader,</b> called RaspiReader, using ubiquitous components. By using our open source STL files and software, RaspiReader {{can be built}} in under one hour for only US $ 175. As such, RaspiReader provides the fingerprint research community a seamless and simple method for quickly prototyping new ideas involving fingerprint reader hardware. In particular, we posit that this open source fingerprint reader will facilitate the exploration of novel fingerprint spoof detection techniques involving both hardware and software. We demonstrate one such spoof detection technique by specially customizing RaspiReader with two cameras for fingerprint image acquisition. One camera provides high contrast, frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) fingerprint images, and the other outputs direct images of the finger {{in contact with the}} platen. Using both of these image streams, we extract complementary information which, when fused together and used for spoof detection, results in marked performance improvement over previous methods relying only on grayscale FTIR images provided by COTS <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> Finally, fingerprint matching experiments between images acquired from the FTIR output of RaspiReader and images acquired from a COTS reader verify the interoperability of the RaspiReader with existing COTS <b>optical</b> <b>readers.</b> Comment: substantial text overlap with arXiv: 1708. 0788...|$|R
