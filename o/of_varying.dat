5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} is {{the study}} of the chemical reactions that are catalysed by enzymes. In enzyme kinetics, the reaction rate is measured and the effects <b>of</b> <b>varying</b> the conditions of the reaction are investigated. Studying an enzyme's kinetics in this way can reveal the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme, its role in metabolism, how its activity is controlled, and how a drug or an agonist might inhibit the enzyme.|$|E
