5|$|For the 1733 version, Bach used a {{somewhat}} more extended orchestra: the recorders are replaced by traversos (Fl) and they get separate parts in all four choral movements. In movements three and four the <b>oboes</b> are replaced by <b>oboes</b> d'amore (Oa). In the 10th movement (Suscepit Israel) the <b>oboes</b> replace the trumpet for the obbligato instrumental part.|$|E
5|$|The second aria is {{accompanied}} by the strings and the two <b>oboes</b> da caccia in unison as obbligato instruments, thus both arias are dominated by instruments with a relatively low range (<b>oboes</b> de caccia having a pitch below that of a normal oboe).|$|E
5|$|The work is scored for vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir SATB, and an {{orchestra}} of two flauto traverso (Ft), two <b>oboes</b> (Ob), two <b>oboes</b> da caccia (Oc), two <b>oboes</b> d'amore (Oa), two violins, viola (Va), and basso continuo. Bach added some instruments which were already old-fashioned {{at the time}} in arias for special effects, such as the archlute, the viola d'amore and the viola da gamba (Vg). Bach did not differentiate the vox Christi (voice of Christ), singing the words of Jesus, from the other bass recitatives and arias, nor the evangelist from the tenor arias.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in nine movements with choral {{movements as}} a frame and in movement 7, otherwise alternating recitatives and arias. He scored it for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and an orchestra of four trumpets (Tr), timpani (Ti), two recorders (Fl), three <b>oboes</b> (Ob), {{two of them}} also playing <b>oboes</b> da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc).|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{an opening}} choral fugue, alternating arias and recitatives and closing chorale. He scored {{the work for}} four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a festive Baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets and timpani, two <b>oboes,</b> strings and continuo. The <b>oboes</b> and strings play with the voices in motet style in the choral sections, while the trumpets add {{the style of a}} new time. The cantata is part of Bach's Picander cycle.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} <b>oboe</b> {{has several}} siblings {{of various sizes}} and playing ranges. The most widely known today is the cor anglais, or English horn, the tenor (or alto) member of the family. A transposing instrument; it is pitched in F, a perfect fifth lower than the <b>oboe.</b> The <b>oboe</b> d'amore, the alto (or mezzo-soprano) member of the family, is pitched in A, a minor third lower than the <b>oboe.</b> J.S. Bach made extensive use of both the <b>oboe</b> d'amore {{as well as the}} taille and <b>oboe</b> da caccia, Baroque antecedents of the cor anglais. Even less common is the bass <b>oboe</b> (also called baritone <b>oboe),</b> which sounds one octave lower than the <b>oboe.</b> Delius and Holst both scored for the instrument. Similar to the bass <b>oboe</b> is the more powerful heckelphone, which has a wider bore and larger tone than the baritone <b>oboe.</b> Only 165 heckelphones have ever been made. Not surprisingly, competent heckelphone players are difficult to find due to the extreme rarity of this particular instrument. The least common of all are the musette (also called <b>oboe</b> musette or piccolo <b>oboe),</b> the sopranino member of the family (it is usually pitched in E or F above the <b>oboe),</b> and the contrabass <b>oboe</b> (typically pitched in C, two octaves deeper than the standard <b>oboe).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The piccolo <b>oboe,</b> {{also known}} as the piccoloboe and {{historically}} called an <b>oboe</b> musette (or just musette), is the smallest and highest pitched member of the <b>oboe</b> family. Pitched in E or F above the regular <b>oboe</b> (i.e. notated a minor third or perfect fourth lower than sounding), the piccolo <b>oboe</b> is a sopranino version of the <b>oboe,</b> comparable to the E clarinet.|$|R

5|$|For {{the festive}} occasion, the cantata is scored for three vocal soloists—alto, tenor and bass—a four-part choir, two horns (corno da caccia), two <b>oboes,</b> two violins, viola and basso continuo.

5|$|In the {{following}} table of the movements, the scoring and keys follow the Neue Bach-Ausgabe for the version performed in 1724, which is in B minor, uses <b>oboes</b> d'amore in the first movement and brass playing colla parte with {{the voices in the}} last movement, a choir of cornett (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) (or trumpets (Tr)). According to the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, the audition version of 1723 had no reinforcement by brass, matching the scoring of the other audition piece. The originally composed version, which was not performed until 1728, was in C minor, had <b>oboes</b> in the opening movement and no brass. The time signatures are taken from the book on all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, played throughout, is not shown.|$|E
