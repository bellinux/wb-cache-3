The Cwmbach lock had a fall of 9.2 ft, after which the middle pound crossed the Nant Pennar stream on an aqueduct to arrive at the Dyffryn lock, which lowered the level by another 3.8 ft.

The analyses used the numerical calculation results of the inflow hydrographs performed in the SWMM (Storm Water Management Model) program on the basis of six-year-long rainfall measurement sequence. The obtained simulation results for the analysed catchment allowed for the performance of statistical analyses, which demonstrated that the volume of stormwater discharge, the maximum instantaneous flow and the share of stormwater volume discharged through the emergency <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> in relation to the total volume of the inflow hydrograph from the catchment are affected by the maximum 30 -minute rainfall depth, whereas the discharge duration is affected by the depth of the catchment rainfall layer.

50|$|Although {{sedimentation}} {{might occur}} in tanks of other shapes, removal of accumulated solids is easiest with conveyor belts in rectangular tanks or with scrapers rotating around the central axis of circular tanks. Mechanical solids removal devices move {{as slowly as}} practical to minimize resuspension of settled solids. Tanks are sized to give water an optimal residence time within the tank. Economy favors using small tanks; but if flow rate through the tank is too high, most particles will not have sufficient time to settle, and will be carried with the treated water. Considerable {{attention is focused on}} reducing water inlet and outlet velocities to minimize turbulence and promote effective settling throughout available tank volume. Baffles are used to prevent fluid velocities at the tank entrance from extending into the tank; and <b>overflow</b> <b>weirs</b> are used to uniformly distribute flow from liquid leaving the tank over a wide area of the surface to minimize resuspension of settling particles.|$|E
50|$|Numerous flood {{retarding}} basins exist along Carbon Canyon Creek below Carbon Canyon Dam. These basins are Miller, Placentia, Raymond, and Gilbert, in downstream order. These basins are occasionally used {{to infiltrate}} water; however, their main {{purpose is to}} reduce floodflows in the area downstream from Carbon Canyon Dam. Miller Basin Complex is approximately3.5 mi downstream of the dam at the confluence of Carbon Canyon Channel and Atwood Channel. It consists of a small stilling basin, retarding basin, desilting basin, and flow diversion structure. Flows entering Miller Basin Complex first run through the stilling basin, then into the desilting basin where a set of <b>overflow</b> <b>weirs</b> split flows between Carbon Canyon DiversionChannel (diverting flows to the Santa Ana River) and the Miller Retarding Basin. The capacity of the stilling basin is 44 ac-ft, while {{the capacity of the}} retarding basin is 340 ac-ft.

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} on a 1 : 25 -scale model of the San Ramon Bypass Channel, Contra Costa County, California, to develop an <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> to remove flows from the channel {{in excess of the}} 100 -year frequency discharge. The <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> would remove flows upstream of the covered channel reach to maintain open channel flow conditions through the covered reach and to not exceed channel capacity downstream of the covered reach. The model reproduced approximately 900 ft of the San Ramon Bypass Channel, 100 ft of the Sans Crainte Creek channel, and 400 ft of the catch channel. The model was constructed so that the slopes of the channels could be adjusted to reproduce various energy gradients equivalent to those resulting from different prototype Manning 2 Ì 7 s n roughness factors. The slopes of the model were initially adjusted to produce an energy gradient resulting from a Manning 2 Ì 7 s n roughness factor of 0. 012 in the prototype. Based on initial water-surface profiles measured in the model without the <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> installed, the weir height was set at 13. 25 ft above the center line invert elevation and the weir length was set at 200 ft. With the <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> installed in the model, water-surface profiles and discharges over the weir were recorded with various flow conditions. The weir length was shortened from the upstream end by 25, 50, and 75 ft. Test results indicated that a weir length of 125 ft set at 13. 25 ft above the center-line invert provided satisfactory results. Discharges over the weir were recorded with various channel discharges for each weir length. The slopes of the high-velocity channels were adjusted to reproduce the energy gradient resulting from a Manning 2 Ì 7 s n roughness factor of 0. 014 in the prototype. These tests {{were conducted}} with an <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> length of 125 ft and weir height of 13. 25 ft. Water-surface profiles and discharges over the weir were recorded with various channel discharges.

The hydraulic parametersâhead loss, velocity patterns, and turbulence structureâwere measured under each set of test conditions. A significantly higher proportion of fish moved through submerged orifices and vertical slots than through <b>overflow</b> <b>weirs</b> for any given flow rate, velocity, and head loss. The orifice and vertical slot efficiencies were directly correlated to the velocities at their entrances. To reach the tested devices, salmon parr tended to remain {{near the bottom of}} the flume and followed paths providing them with low velocities and cover along the sides of the test arena. The movements of salmon approaching entrances were consistent with energy-conserving strategies.

40|$|This {{technical}} note describes a spreadsheet calculatioml procedure (DILUTE) for estimating alternate releases from different outlet devices {{to meet a}} specific release dissolved oxygen target. Background When low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations occur in release from a Corps of Engineers reservoir, an option for increasing the level of DO leaving the tailrace is a supplemental release through an aerating outlet. For example, during nongeneration periods, a small discharge of poorquality water can pass through the hydroturbines because of wicket gate leakage. Without some improvement technique, the water leaving the tailrace area would be very low in DO. The DC) concentration of the water leaving the tailrace area can be improved by diluting this poorquality water with highly aerated water from another outlet at the project. Sluiceway, spillway, or <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> releases are most often used in this enhancement technique. Generally, the flow from a spillway, sluiceway, or an <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> will have a much higher DO concentration than the poorquality discharge. A flow-weighted average {{can be used to}} estimate the required release from the aerating outlet to provide a desired average DO level exiting the tailrace area. To estimate the required release from the alternate source, the DO of the alternate release must be calculated. The spreadsheet DILUTE calculates the oxygen concentration in the releases through the aerating outlet and uses this concentration in the flow-weighted averaging process to estimate the required release discharge.
