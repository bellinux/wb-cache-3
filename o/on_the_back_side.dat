5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} sensory organ occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> of the maxillary fossa, which implies that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of {{the outline of the}} skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized sensory organ analogous to the pit organ of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of nerve cells. It is also possible that this organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded sensory organ would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|E
5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} pipistrelle. It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish-brown below. The glandular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are hairless. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is about half as long as the ear and contains a slight constriction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> of its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth metacarpals (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first phalange (finger bone) on the third finger is short. P.endoi has a longer first phalange on the third metacarpal. P.raceyi has short tibiae (lower leg bones) and small feet and the tail is shorter than the head and body. Forearm length is 28.0 to 31.2mm (1.10 to 1.23in), tail length is 22.9 to 30.3mm (0.90 to 1.19in), hindfoot length is 5.3 to 7.5mm (0.21 to 0.30in), and ear length is 7.5 to 10.6mm (0.30 to 0.42in) in 13 measured specimens. Females average slightly larger than males.|$|E
25|$|The Clinic, a one-story {{structure}} {{consisting of}} two rooms with an exterior door for each room on the west side, built over a rock cellar circa 1923. Located behind the manse, it has corrugated metal siding with four windows spanning the front wall and two windows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{traditional}} screentone sheet {{consists of}} a flexible transparent <b>backing,</b> <b>the</b> printed texture, and a wax adhesive layer.

50|$|The {{color of}} this species is variable, and can be brown, gray, green, or {{yellowish}} above, often with red blotches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> middle of <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> Usually there are between 9 and 13 dark crossbands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> <b>sides,</b> and tail, with adjacent white spots. These crossbands can be pronounced or covered with reddish or yellowish color.|$|R

25|$|The {{cross-sectional}} {{shape of the}} hob teeth are almost the same shape as teeth of a rack gear {{that would be used}} with the finished product. There are slight changes to the shape for generating purposes, such as extending the hob's tooth length to create a clearance in the gear's roots. Each hob tooth is relieved <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> to reduce friction.|$|E
25|$|Various {{artefacts}} {{of daily}} life are also clearly Hellenistic: sundials, ink wells, tableware. An almost life-sized dark green glass phallus with a small owl <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> and other treasures {{are said to have}} been discovered at Ai-Khanoum, possibly along with a stone with an inscription, which was not recovered. The artefacts have now been returned to the Kabul Museum after several years in Switzerland by Paul Bucherer-Dietschi, Director of the Swiss Afghanistan Institute.|$|E
25|$|Isolated {{characters}} from the Byblos syllabary {{have also been}} found on various other objects, such as axes and pottery. Also, a spatula is known which has on the front side a Phoenician inscription and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> traces of a Proto-Byblian inscription—about half a dozen proto-Byblian characters are recognizable. The Phoenician inscription on this spatula is dated to the 10th century BC which suggests that Pseudo-hieroglyphs may have remained in use longer than is usually assumed.|$|E
50|$|The {{scales of}} E. multicarinata are keeled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> <b>sides,</b> and legs. There are 14 rows of scales across <b>the</b> <b>back</b> at <b>the</b> {{middle of the}} body. A band of smaller {{granular}} scales separates <b>the</b> larger scales <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and stomach, creating a fold along {{each side of the}} animal. These folds allow the body to expand to hold food or eggs.|$|R

In 2001 the complete text, in six volumes, was published in Russia.|$|R
25|$|During the Santa Ana winds, large ocean waves can develop. These waves {{come from}} a northeasterly direction; toward the {{normally}} sheltered side of Catalina Island. Protected harbors such as Avalon and Two Harbors are normally sheltered and the waters within the harbors are very calm. In strong Santa Ana conditions, these harbors develop high surf and strong winds that can tear boats from their moorings and crash them onto the shore. During a Santa Ana, it is advised that boaters moor <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> of the island to avoid the dangerous conditions of the front side.|$|E
25|$|Following the Challenger disaster, {{examination}} of the recovered vehicle cockpit revealed {{that three of the}} crew members Personal Egress Air Packs were activated: those of Onizuka, mission specialist Judith Resnik, and pilot Michael Smith. The location of Smith's activation switch, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> of his seat, means that either Resnik or Onizuka could have activated it for him. This is the only evidence available from the disaster that shows Onizuka and Resnik were alive after the cockpit separated from the vehicle. However, if the cabin had lost pressure, the packs alone would not have sustained the crew during the two-minute descent.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, the Robbins Company {{took over}} production. They {{produced}} six distinct variants, all in sterling silver. The first 1920 version {{was similar to}} the Dieges & Clust design, but with smaller scroll lettering and the standard single knot. The second 1920 version has more distinctive feathering <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> of the pendant. The engraving on the 1930 version is especially fine. In 1933, BSA was removed from all of the Eagle Scout insignia, including the medal. In 1955 the obverse of the eagle pendant was made flat so it could be engraved. BSA was added back to the front and the reverse was returned to a full feathered design in 1969.|$|E

50|$|The {{banknotes}} of Denmark, 1972 {{series are}} part of the physical form of Denmark's currency, the Krone (kr). They have been issued solely by Danmarks Nationalbank since 1 August 1818. They are still valid but are no longer printed. The theme of the notes is paintings by Jens Juel (1745-1802) of various more or less famous people <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front sides and common animals in Denmark <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Antimenes Painter (530–500 BC) {{liked to}} {{decorate}} hydria with animal friezes in the predella, and otherwise especially neck amphoras. Two hydria attributed to him are decorated {{on the neck}} region using a white ground technique. He {{was the first to}} paint amphoras with a masklike face of Dionysus. The most famous of his over 200 surviving vases shows an olive harvest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side.</b> His drawings are seldom really precise, but neither are they excessively careless. Stylistically, the painter Psiax is closely related to the Antimenes Painter, although the former also used the red-figure technique. As the teacher of the painters Euphronius and Phintias, Psiax had a great influence on the early development of the red-figure style. He frequently shows horse and chariot scenes and archers.|$|E
25|$|Front Street – The final {{component}} of Adriaen's Landing, 'Front Street', {{sits across from}} the Convention Center and covers the land between Columbus Boulevard and The Hartford Times Building. The Front Street development combines retail, entertainment and residential components. Publicly funded parts of the project will include transportation improvements. There have been significant delays in the Front Street project – the first developer {{was removed from the}} project because of lack of progress. The city has chosen a new developer, but work is yet to begin on the retail and residential {{component of}} Front Street. The city and state may soon take action to increase the speed with which the project enters implementation phases. There has been talk of bringing an ESPN Zone to the Front Street (ESPN is headquartered in nearby Bristol). <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> of Front Street, the historic Beaux-Arts Hartford Times Buildinzg is being converted into a downtown campus of the University of Connecticut.|$|E
