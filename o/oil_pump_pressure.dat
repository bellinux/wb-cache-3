40|$|AbstractHydrostatic guide-ways {{utilizing}} {{thin film}} feedback restrictor are {{applied for the}} ultra-precision optical aspheric machine tool that we have developed. this machine tool. The parameters of the PM flow controllers have a direct influence on the dynamic performance of the hydrostatic worktable. During the machining process, the cutting force acted on the cutting tool and other load will {{be transferred to the}} hydrostatic guide-way. On the basis of the flow equation of the PM controller and the force schematic of the hydrostatic worktable, this paper theoretically establishes a mathematic model of the hydrostatic guide-ways of the worktable. The transfer function is derived, and the influence of the restrictor parameters, including the initial flow rate, <b>oil</b> film thickness, <b>pump</b> <b>pressure</b> and initial flow ratio, on the dynamic performance of the hydrostatic guide-way is studied. According to the results, it needs the longest time at the flow rate ratio Kr of 5 for the hydrostatic bearing system to adjust and the maximum displacement and the maximum overshoot arose. When the flow rate of the restrictor reaches 20 cm 3 /s, the overshoot and response time of the hydrostatic guide-way bearing system hardly increase. The final displacement of the system decreases when the <b>pump</b> <b>pressure</b> increases. The effect of <b>pump</b> <b>pressure</b> increase provides a decrease in the final displacement of the system...|$|R
50|$|There {{are only}} 4 reasons for low oil pressure. 1) no oil or low {{oil in the}} engine 2) worn or {{defective}} <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> or broken <b>pressure</b> relief valve spring 3) worn main bearings (big ends {{have nothing to do}} with oil pressure as most of the pressure to these are supplied by centrifugal force and 4) oil gallery fracture or blockage. Low oil pressure can cause engine damage. First thing to fail will be cam carrier bearings if vehicle is OHC as this is fed through a restrictor and low pressure will starve top of engine of lube.If pistons have crown jets eg scania,could cause piston/liner nip. Also the crankshaft and connecting rod bearings will seize. Indications of low oil pressure may be that the warning light is on, a low pressure reading on the gauge, or clattering/clinking noises from the engine. Low oil pressure is a problem that must be addressed immediately to prevent serious damage.|$|R

50|$|There is {{a common}} oiling problem with the pre-1992 R32 RB26 motors, as the surface where the {{crankshaft}} meets the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> was machined too small, eventually leading to <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> failure at high rpm. This issue was resolved in later versions of the RB26 with a wider <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> drive. Aftermarket performance parts makers also make <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> extension drive collars to rectify this problem.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{hydraulic}} efficiency, modern automatic transmissions tend to apply electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> in their hydraulic system. The electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> can support the mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> for cooling, lubrication, and maintaining the line pressure at low engine speeds. In addition, the start–stop function can be realized {{by means of the}} electric oil pump; thus, the fuel consumption can be further reduced. This article proposes a method of applying two-pump system (one electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> and one mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>pump)</b> in automatic transmissions based on the forward driving simulation. A mathematical model for calculating the transmission power loss is developed. The power loss transfers to heat which requires oil flow for cooling and lubrication. A leakage model is developed to calculate the leakage of the hydraulic system. In order to satisfy the flow requirement, a flow-based control strategy for the electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> is developed. Simulation results of different driving cycles show that there is a best combination of the size of electric <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> and the size of mechanical <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> with respect to the optimal energy conservation. Besides, the two-pump system can also satisfy the requirement of the start–stop function. This research is extremely valuable for the forward design of a two-pump system in automatic transmissions with respect to energy conservation and start–stop function...|$|R
30|$|In Fig.  1, the {{emulsified}} oil, which {{flows from}} the overflow pipe {{and then into the}} strainer through the filling valve, thereby filtering bulky mechanical impurities. The emulsified oil then flows into the vacuum separation chamber through the oil-taking control valve and the oil-taking solenoid valve. After the pressure is increased by the <b>oil</b> circulating <b>pump,</b> the emulsified <b>oil</b> is heated by the heater and the temperature gradually increases. After stabilizing temperature using the temperature controller, an oil mist cover is formed because of the positive pressure {{at the top of the}} vacuum chamber by the atomizer. This mist can prevent the rise of oil bubbles in the vacuum separation chamber and can avoid the injection of the vacuum <b>pump</b> of <b>oil</b> during the operation. Thus, antifoaming is automatically prevented. After atomization, the oil reenters the efficient separation tower, in which an oil film is again formed. The developed area of the oil film significantly increases. The water in the oil rapidly transforms from liquid into vapor. When nitrogen is at the bottom of the vacuum separation chamber, the water vapor in oil is removed and expelled from the top. Under the <b>oil</b> drain <b>pump,</b> the <b>pressure</b> of <b>oil</b> after dehydration changes from negative to positive, and the oil {{flows from the}} oil discharge outlet through the check valve and the fine filter.

40|$|In {{addition}} to the adequate lubrication of the moving parts, the oil flow in a hermetic reciprocating compressor has a significant influence on the thermal characteristics of a compressor.

40|$|An Oil filter is {{a filter}} to remove {{contaminants}} from engine oil, transmission oil, lubricating oil, or hydraulic oil. Oil filters {{are used in}} {{many different types of}} hydraulic machinery. A chief use of the oil filter is in internal-combustion engines in on- and off-road motor vehicles, light aircraft, and various naval vessels. Other vehicle hydraulic systems, such as those in automatic transmissions and power steering, are often equipped with an oil filter. Gas turbine engines, such as those on jet aircraft, require the use of oil filters. And oil production, transport, and recycling facilities employ filters.
