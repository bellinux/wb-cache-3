40|$|Purpose This {{chapter is}} devoted to {{analysing}} the historical peculiarity of the contemporary British politics <b>of</b> <b>policing.</b> Methodology/approach Research {{is based on an}} analysis of policy statements and debates, news reports, and official statistics, in the light of historical studies of the earlier politics <b>of</b> <b>policing.</b> Findings The Conservative government’s police reform programme severely diminishes the resources, powers, status and independence <b>of</b> the <b>police,</b> reversing the Tory’s traditional unquestioning support <b>of</b> the <b>police.</b> The package is shown to reflect broader changes in political economy and culture under neoliberalism. Originality/value There has been no previous academic analysis bringing together the various aspects of the reform programme, contrasting it with previous historical understanding of the politics <b>of</b> <b>policing,</b> and linking it to broader contemporary change...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Sociological Research Online and the definitive published version is available at [URL] article focuses on <b>police</b> officers’ views <b>of</b> the professionalisation <b>of</b> <b>policing</b> in England {{against a backdrop of}} government reforms to <b>policing</b> via establishment <b>of</b> the College <b>of</b> <b>Policing,</b> evidence-based policing and a period <b>of</b> austerity. <b>Police</b> officers view professionalisation as linked to: top-down government reforms; education and recruitment; the building of an evidence-base; and the ethics <b>of</b> <b>policing</b> (Peelian principles). These elements are further entangled with new public management principles, highlighting the ways in which professionalism {{can be used as a}} technology of control to discipline workers. There are tensions between the government’s top-down drive for police organisations to professionalise and officers’ bottom-up views <b>of</b> <b>policing</b> as an established profession. Data is presented from qualitative interviews with 15 police officers and staff in England...|$|R
