5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Göttingen, Goeppert Mayer wrote her doctorate on the theory of possible two-photon absorption by atoms. At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> permitted this. Today, the unit for the two-photon absorption cross section is named the Goeppert Mayer (GM) unit.|$|E
5|$|By {{moving the}} pan-tilt units <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> range finders, {{it is also}} {{possible}} to obtain a point cloud in three dimensions. Technical readjustment between the model of the aircraft and the scene point cloud is already used in navigation to estimate the static placement of the robot. It is planned to make targeted acquisitions, simpler in terms of movement, to verify the absence of chocks in front of the landing gear wheels, or the proper closing of engine cowling latches.|$|E
5|$|Near the aircraft, a {{point cloud}} in three {{dimensions}} is acquired by changing the orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> scanning sensors fixed on pan-tilt units. After filtering data to remove floor- or insufficiently large dot clusters, a registration technique with {{the model of the}} aircraft is used to estimate the static orientation of the robot. The robot moves and holds this orientation by considering its wheel odometry, its inertial unit and visual odometry.|$|E

40|$|A multi-state optical {{flip-flop}} memory {{based on}} cascaded lasers is presented. We show {{that only one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lasers</b> can lase at a time, thus <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical memory is determined by <b>the</b> wavelength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dominant <b>laser.</b> <b>The</b> light from <b>the</b> dominant <b>laser</b> suppresses its neighboring lasers through gain saturation, but still receives amplification by <b>the</b> active element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suppressed <b>lasers,</b> compensating for coupling losses. This light passes through each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> successive <b>lasers,</b> simultaneously suppressing and being amplified, thus all other lasers are suppressed.

5|$|One {{advantage}} of this design was that the diodes created light around the same frequency as the laser glass' output, {{as compared to the}} white light flashtubes where most of the energy in the flash was wasted as it was not near the active frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> glass. This change increased the energy efficiency to about 10%, a dramatic improvement.|$|E
5|$|The {{small size}} and {{independence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> modules allowed the huge NIF building to be dispensed with. Instead, the modules were arranged in groups surrounding the target chamber in a compact arrangement. In baseline designs, the modules were stacked in 2-wide by 8-high groups in two rings {{above and below}} the target chamber, shining their light through small holes drilled into the chamber to protect them from the neutron flux coming back out.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{a number}} of {{different}} drivers were considered, but the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> a few years later provided the first obvious solution with the right combination of features. The desired energies were well beyond {{the state of the art}} in laser design, so LLNL began a laser development program in the mid-1960s to reach these levels. Each increase in energy led to new and unexpected optical phenomena that had to be overcome, but these were largely solved by the mid-1970s. Working in parallel with the laser teams, physicists studying the expected reaction using computer simulations adapted from thermonuclear bomb work developed a program known as LASNEX that suggested Q of 1 could be produced at much lower energy levels, in the kilojoule range, levels that the laser team were now able to deliver.|$|E

40|$|Erbium {{photoluminescence}} in GaN:Er was {{studied with}} above-band-gap excitation, {{provided by a}} He-Cd (lambda = 325 nm) laser and below-band-gap excitation by a tunable Ti-Sa <b>laser.</b> <b>The</b> spectra obtained with these two lasers exhibit different spectral shapes. When both lasers are used at the same time, we observe that the Er 3 + photoluminescence induced by each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lasers</b> is partly quenched by <b>the</b> illumination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other <b>laser.</b> In this experiment, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lasers</b> is modulated and a lockin amplifier is used to filter the corresponding photoluminescence signal. The spectra recorded this way {{are found to be}} linear combinations of spectra obtained with each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lasers</b> used separately. This effect is explained by <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> defects mediating <b>the</b> excitation towards the Er 3 + ions. These defects act as electron traps, which can be populated by one specific laser excitation and are photo-ionized by <b>the</b> other <b>laser</b> leading to a large quenching of Er 3 + emission.

5|$|Other recent {{developments}} in welding include the 1958 breakthrough of electron beam welding, making deep and narrow welding possible through the concentrated heat source. Following the invention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> in 1960, laser beam welding debuted several decades later, and {{has proved to be}} especially useful in high-speed, automated welding. Magnetic pulse welding (MPW) is industrially used since 1967. Friction stir welding was invented in 1991 by Wayne Thomas at The Welding Institute (TWI, UK) and found high-quality applications all over the world. All of these four new processes continue to be quite expensive due the high cost of the necessary equipment, and this has limited their applications.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders {{has been}} remade on {{numerous}} platforms and spawned many sequels. Re-releases include ported and updated {{versions of the}} original arcade game. Ported versions generally feature different graphics and additional gameplay options—for example, moving defense bunkers, zigzag shots, invisible aliens, and two-player cooperative gameplay. Ports on earlier systems like the Atari home consoles featured simplified graphics, while later systems such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and PlayStation featured updated graphics. Later titles include several modes of gameplay and integrate new elements into the original design. For example, Space Invaders Extreme, released on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable, integrated musical elements into the standard gameplay. A spin-off for WiiWare, Space Invaders Get Even, allows players to control the aliens instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> cannon.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, many {{manufacturers}} have added additional coloring to disguise their unstable cyanine CD-Rs in the past, so {{the formulation of}} a disc cannot be determined based purely on its color. Similarly, a gold reflective layer does not guarantee use of phthalocyanine dye. The quality of the disc is also not only dependent on the dye used, it is also influenced by sealing, the top layer, the reflective layer, and the polycarbonate. Simply choosing a disc based on its dye type may be problematic. Furthermore, correct power calibration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> in the writer, as well as correct timing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laser</b> pulses, stable disc speed, and so on, is critical to not only the immediate readability but the longevity of the recorded disc, so for archiving {{it is important to}} have not only a high quality disc but a high quality writer.
