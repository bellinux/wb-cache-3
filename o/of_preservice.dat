40|$|Much attention, both {{nationally and}} internationally, {{has been given}} to {{mathematics}} teaching and student mathematical performance (e. g. No Child Left Behind Act (2001), National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (1991, 2000) standards, Common Core State Standards Initiative, Trend in International Mathematics and Science Study (2013), and Program of International Student Assessment PISA (2013)). Teachers of mathematics have come under greater scrutiny and demands for student success have been placed upon them. Research has shown that teacher efficacy and mathematics teaching efficacy, forms of self-efficacy beliefs (Bandura, 1977, 1997), can {{have a positive impact on}} teaching and learning. Yet, there has been limited research on the mathematics teacher efficacy <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> elementary teachers (Swars, 2005). This study examined the impact of the student teaching experience on the mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> elementary teachers. What happens to the level of mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers during the student teaching experience? What are the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers with low and high levels of efficacy beliefs? What factors from the student teaching experience influenced efficacy beliefs? A qualitative case study (Merriam, 2009) with an embedded survey was used to address the previous questions. The results of this study demonstrate that mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers rose significantly during the student teaching experience. However, the change was not uniform. Personal mathematics teaching efficacy (PMTE) increased significantly. Although mathematics teaching outcome expectancy (MTOE) increased, it was not significant. Furthermore, the research indicates four characteristics influenced mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs: attitude toward mathematics, use of manipulatives, motivation to teach, and persistence. Four factors appear to impact the development of efficacy beliefs <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers: prior experiment with mathematics, student teaching experience, relationship with cooperating teacher, and students served by the preservice teachers...|$|E

40|$|Practicum {{is a vital}} {{component}} <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> {{teacher education}} but national and international reviews have raised concerns regarding the low {{quality and quantity of}} mentoring received by preservice teachers. Without adequate mentoring and guidance, the professional development <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers may not be maximised during these crucial real-world learning experiences. Mentoring <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers while on practicum is typically undertaken by classroom teachers, many of whom lack understanding of mentoring requirements and may not have the necessary skills for facilitating preservice teachers‟ development. Therefore, government reviews recommend that higher education institutions prepare mentor teachers for their roles and Australian universities have responded accordingly. Such recommendations are made under an assumption that professional development will develop current knowledge and skills on effective mentoring. However, while it is expected that professional development will be beneficial to new mentors, it is not as obvious how it will benefit experienced mentors. Hence, this paper addresses: How can professional development serve experienced and inexperienced mentors <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers? By examining a 10 -hour professional development program that aims to prepare teachers for mentoring preservice teachers, we have identified potential rewards. Content analysis of interviews with ten mentor teachers and oral and written program reflections from 27 participants revealed that mentoring professional development can benefit mentors of all levels of experience because it acts as: (a) a professional information source, (b) a prompt, and (c) an affirmer. It can also: (d) initiate professional dialogue about mentoring <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> teachers and (e) reinvigorate educational professionals in their work with preservice teachers. These rewards were attributable to the following: the professional development program was founded on a research-backed theoretical framework, it provided opportunities for more experienced mentors to share effective practices with newer mentors, and it necessitated discussions within individual schools towards school-wide approaches for mentoring preservice teachers...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of a training intervention on the dogmatism, flexibility, and attitudes <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> students. The content of the program was based on the following two models of teaching: the Concept Attainment model and the Synectics model. ^ The quasi-experimental research design was used for this study. The subjects were members of two intact groups. All subjects were administered the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale, Form E, as a pretest and the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory as a posttest. Flexibility was measured using the modified Flanders 2 ̆ 7 Interaction Analysis System (Flanders, 1970). ^ Analysis of variance was the major statistical procedure used for data analysis. The alpha level for statistical significance was set at. 05. The findings for this study were: (1) No significant relationships were found between dogmatism and flexibility, dogmatism and attitudes, and flexibility and attitudes <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> students. A significant relationship, however, was detected between the levels of flexibility for preservice students. (2) No significant difference was found between the pretreatment and post-treatment teaching flexibility of senior preservice students. (3) No significant difference was detected between the teaching flexibility of junior and senior preservice students. (4) Elementary preservice students were significantly more flexible than secondary preservice students. (5) No significant difference was found in the teaching flexibility and attitudes between low dogmatic and high dogmatic preservice students. (6) Preservice students were significantly more flexible during the second teaching episode than during the first teaching episode. ^ The significant findings for this study indicate that the training intervention had an effect on the flexibility <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> students, thus suggesting that the teaching flexibility <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> students can be influenced through training. This, however, is inconclusive as pre-treatment flexibility scores were not available and comparison between the pre- and post-treatment teaching flexibility <b>of</b> <b>preservice</b> students was not possible. ...|$|E
