40|$|The Winner <b>s</b> <b>Curse</b> (WC) is a non-equilibrium {{behavior}} in common-value auctions involving systematic and persistent overbidding that {{often results in}} signi ficant losses. It {{is one of the}} most robust fi ndings in laboratory experiments. We developed an auction mechanism with a payment rule that internalizes the adverse selection by inducing a simple strategy, sincere bidding, as no-regret equilibrium. Other less efficient payment rules, that use more than the minimal information needed, may also induce sincere bidding as equilibrium. However, given concerns with the WC, we study whether such less minimal rules can help bidders find their way to equilibrium bidding. Our main experimental fi ndings are that the no-regret minimal payment rule results in more WC than the English auction. Yet, a less efficient but more intuitive payment rule addresses overbidding better than the minimal payment rule and, remarkably for a static, sealed-bid design, matches the performance of the English auction...|$|R

40|$|Although autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASDs) have {{a substantial}} genetic basis, most of the known genetic risk has been traced to rare variants, principally copy number variants (CNVs). To identify common risk variation, the Autism Genome Project (AGP) Consortium genotyped 1558 rigorously defined ASD families for 1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and analyzed these SNP genotypes for association with ASD. In one of four primary association analyses, the association signal for marker rs 4141463, located within MACROD 2, crossed the genome-wide association significance threshold of P < 5 ? 10 ? 8. When a smaller replication sample was analyzed, the risk allele at rs 4141463 was again over-transmitted; yet, consistent with the winner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>curse,</b> its effect size in the replication sample was much smaller; and, for the combined samples, the association signal barely fell below the P < 5 ? 10 ? 8 threshold.

40|$|The {{standard}} model of judicial behavior suggests that judges primarily care about deciding cases {{in ways that}} further their political ideologies. But judicial behavior seems much more complex. Politicians who nominate people for judgeships do not typically tout their ideology (except sometimes using vague code words), but they always claim that the nominees will be competent judges. Moreover, {{it stands to reason}} that voters would support politicians who appoint competent as well as ideologically compatible judges. We test this hypothesis using a dataset consisting of promotions to the federal circuit courts. We find, using a set of objective measures of judicial performance, that competence seems to matter in promotions in that the least competent judges do not get elevated. But the judges who score the highest on our competence measures also do not get elevated.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines common value auctions {{in which}} bidder default is allowed. Contractual default {{on the part}} of bidders is commonly observed in many auction settings and yet has remained virtually unexplored in the literature. We develop a two bidder model of a common value auction with default. We solve for the equilibria in both the default and no-default cases. Two key theoretical results are produced by the model: (i) bidders are more aggressive in their bidding when default is allowed, and (ii) allowing default can actually lead to an increase in the auctioneer 2 ̆ 7 s expected revenue in certain situations. In addition to the theoretical approach, we use a laboratory experiment to study this problem. Our experimental results confirm result (i). Subjects in our experiments do indeed bid more aggressively when default is allowed. Result (ii) is rejected. We find that in our experimental auctions the auctioneer is always better off by not allowing bidder default. We also compare our experimental results to the existing literature. This approach extends the experimental literature on common value auctions to include cases of limited liability. We also show that a winner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>curse</b> exists in auctions with only two bidders. ...|$|R

40|$|Over Sam Shepard’s forty-plus year {{career as}} a playwright, his work has closely {{followed}} a very specific format. While the work itself varies wildly in subject matter, style, and language, his protagonists continue to age along with the playwright. Since tackling his family and alcoholic father in 1977 <b>s</b> <b>Curse</b> of the Starving Class, his main characters continually struggled with their father figures through the different stages of their lives: Wesley as the young teenager in Curse, Vince as the twenty-something in Buried Child, Austin and Lee as 30 -somethings in True West, Eddie as the late 30 s cowboy in Fool for Love, and Jake and Frankie in A Lie of the Mind. The Late Henry Moss, first produced in 2000, signaled a seismic shift in Shepard’s work. The father figure dies (in the same manner Shepard’s father did) and leaves the two brothers to ponder what happens next. What does happen is that Shepard’s latest plays, God of Hell, Kicking a Dead Horse, and Ages of the Moon, don’t focus on the father/ son dynamic at all. The protagonists have continued to age along with Shepard, but their struggles have become more internal, more self-aware, but no less tragic. These latest plays show an artist grappling with his own mistakes, not his father’s, his own mortality, not his father’s, and his own legacy. These plays are the totality of a life lived and signal a natural progression in Shepard’s work that is only possible with his age and experiences...|$|R
40|$|Auctions play an {{important}} role in economics. In their most basic form, they are one of the ways in which various commodities, financial assets and concession rights are allocated to individuals and firms, particularly in a market-oriented setting. An auction is a market institution with an explicit set of rules determining resource allocation and prices on the basis of bids from the market participants. Since some products such as spectrum concessions have no standard value, auctions provide one way approaching the question of price formation of these products. This paper explores the details of Turkish GSM 1800 MHz auction held in April, 2000 within auction theory and competition policies framework. According to the findings of this study, since the auction design inappropriately dealt with market conditions, Is-Tim, winning bidders of one of two spectrums on offer, was able to make a high bid by deriving the price of first license, the reserve price of second one, up to excessive level, so other bidders were not able to afford to bid over this price at second round. First finding of this study is that Is-Tim is either predatory pricer or winner <b>s</b> <b>curse</b> both of which undermines general economic efficiency. As a result by not selling second license, Turkish GSM market has been unnecessarily concentrated; Turkish Treasury has obtained less revenue than it would; and the liability of TT owner of third license at the extremely high winning price of the first license, has soared more than what it otherwise would be by possibly undermining the market value of TT.

Admission to the event is free, and all are welcome to attend. Should equal rights for gay people give way to liberties for religious people? According to Eskridge, a similar question was posed a generation ago – Should equal rights for people of color give way to the liberties of religious people? His lecture will explore this controversial parallel and its implications. Since joining the Yale faculty in 1998, Eskridge has taught Constitutional Law, Legislation, Theories of Statutory Interpretation, and Sexuality, Gender and the Law. With more than 20 years in the legal academy, he has also taught at Georgetown University, New York University and Harvard University. Before beginning his teaching career, Eskridge clerked for Judge Edward Weinfeld of the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and practiced law at Shea 2 ̆ 6 Gardner. He has published a field-establishing casebook, three monographs and dozens of law review articles articulating a legal and political framework for proper state treatment of sexual and gender minorities. The historical materials in his book Gaylaw: Challenging the Apartheid of the Closet formed the basis for an amicus brief he drafted for the Cato Institute and for much of the U. S. Supreme Court’s analysis in Lawrence v. Texas (2003), which invalidated consensual sodomy laws. Eskridge earned his B. A. summa cum laude from Davidson College and his masters degree from Harvard University. He then earned his J. D. from Yale, where he was the note and topics editor of The Yale Law Journal. The Sibley Lecture Series, established in 1964 by the Charles Loridans Foundation of Atlanta in tribute to the late John A. Sibley, is designed to attract outstanding legal scholars of national prominence to Georgia Law. Sibley was a 1911 graduate of the law school. #...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{variations in}} corporate fiduciary duties arising from financial distress. This paper argues {{whether there is}} an affirmatively enforceable duty under the principles of Credit Lyonnais is not moot, because, inter alia, the availability of aiding and abetting liability for breach of fiduciary duty will give rise to a greater set of potentially liable defendants (aiding and abetting a fraudulent transfer typically not separately giving rise to liability), allowing a court to reverse some outcomes that would otherwise obtain under the in pari delicto doctrine and the Wagoner rule, and will expand the remedies available. This paper argues application of the business judgment rule to directors 2 ̆ 7 operation of a distressed firm should be, if anything, stronger than the corresponding provision applied to a solvent firm. The rationale is that a contrary right would create an anomalous option for creditors having expressly negotiated approval rights - one that would be difficult to value and that would create greater costs of investigation in order to avoid being a winner in a contest presenting a winner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>curse.</b> This paper also examines the interplay of distress with approval of conflict of interest and final period transactions. It concludes that during distress short of insolvency, fiduciary duties to maximize firm value on a sale should continue to be owed to stockholders, and that approval of conflict-of-interest transactions by disinterested stockholders should continue to shift the burden of proof as to transaction fairness. Lastly, this paper argues for an increase in the duty of candor, following Malone v. Brincat, during distress appertaining to communications to creditors. Financial creditors will consider information a debtor provides in deciding whether to exercise contractually negotiated control rights. Creditors should be entitled to rely on truthfulness even if the debtor is unaware of a particular action the creditor may take in reliance. As proposed, a creditor would not need to prove a distressed debtor made a statement for purposes of influencing the creditor 2 ̆ 7 s conduct because financial creditors may be presumed to be deciding whether to exercise remedies on an ongoing basis. Other elements of a cause of action, e. g., whether a defendant failed to exercise the appropriate care in assuring the accuracy of the statement, would remain unchanged.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} cultural {{presence of the}} quarto book in Romantic-era Britain and argues that the format classed the period 2 ̆ 7 s defining literary ideologies [...] from sentimentalism, to liberalism, to Wordsworthian Romanticism, to orientalism [...] as luxuries meant exclusively for the nation 2 ̆ 7 s wealthiest consumers. Chapter 1 situates the quarto {{within the context of}} the period 2 ̆ 7 s luxury debates and advances a conception of the quarto as the era 2 ̆ 7 s predominant luxury format. Focusing on Oliver Goldsmith 2 ̆ 7 s The Deserted Village, Chapter 2 argues that early quarto editions of the poem classed the sympathetic feeling it celebrated as the unique privilege of a readerly elite and describes how the poem was later appropriated and repurposed by radically oriented Irish and English printers. In so doing, the chapter shows that British sentimentalism 2 ̆ 7 s political alignments were shaped by the formats of its major texts as much as changing political contexts. Chapter 3 argues that the Crown 2 ̆ 7 s refusal to prosecute quarto publications during the 1790 s gave the format a protected status that was exploited by the era 2 ̆ 7 s major publisher of respectably radical political literature, Joseph Johnson. By publishing the anti-monarchical poems of Blake, Barlow, Wordsworth, and Coleridge in quarto, Johnson curbed their seditious tendencies and configured them as liberal works whose textual appeals to middle-class audiences were reinforced by their bibliographic format. Chapter 4 examines William Wordsworth 2 ̆ 7 s use of the quarto format to publish his career-defining poem The Excursion, arguing that the poem 2 ̆ 7 s quarto publication was not only intended to mitigate Wordsworth 2 ̆ 7 s anxieties of influence or declare his newly Royalist political alliance but that it also succeeded in classing the poem 2 ̆ 7 s aesthetic ideology for many Regency readers.

40|$|The Czech {{composer}} Petr Eben (1927 - 2007) {{has written}} music in all genres except symphony, {{but he is}} highly recognized for his organ and choral compositions, which are his preferred genres. His vocal works include choral songs and vocal-instrumental works at {{a wide range of}} difficulty levels, from simple pedagogical songs to very advanced and technically challenging compositions. This study examines two of Eben‘s vocal-instrumental compositions. The oratorio Apologia Sokratus (1967) is a three-movement work; its libretto is based on Plato‘s Apology of Socrates. The ballet Curses and Blessings (1983) has a libretto compiled from numerous texts from the thirteenth to the twentieth centuries. The formal design of the ballet is unusual—a three-movement composition where the first is choral, the second is orchestral, and the third combines the previous two played simultaneously. Eben assembled the libretti for both compositions and they both address the contrasting sides of the human soul, evil and good, and the everlasting fight between them. This unity and contrast is the philosophical foundation for both compositions. The dissertation discusses the multileveled meanings behind the text settings and musical style of the oratorio and ballet in analyses focusing on the text, melodic and harmonic construction, and symbolism. Additional brief analyses of other vocal and vocal-instrumental compositions by Eben establish the ground for the examination of the oratorio and ballet and for understanding features of the composer‘s musical style. While the oratorio Apologia Sokratus was discussed in short articles in the 1970 <b>s,</b> the ballet <b>Curses</b> and Blessings has never previously been addressed within Eben scholarship. The dissertation examines the significant features of Eben‘s music. His melodic style incorporates influences as diverse as Gregorian chant and folk tunes on the one hand, and modern vocal techniques such as Sprechgesang and vocal aleatoricism on the other. His harmonic language includes bitonality and polytonality, used to augment the tonal legacy of earlier times, together with elements of pitch collections and limited serial procedures as well as various secundal and quartal harmonic sonorities derived from them.

40|$|The {{object of}} this study is an {{investigation}} of the connection between the Indian divinatory practice known as jyotish and Hindu devotion. By focusing on the connection between jyotish and devotion, I want to offer a new perspective on 2 ̆ 2 the most prestigious and encompassing form of Hindu divination, permeating Indian society today as it has done for centuries: from its universities - where, as part of current Hindutva efforts and amidst much upheaval, astrology was recently introduced as an academic discipline - to the matrimonial columns of its daily papers. 2 ̆ 2 Jyotish, literally meaning 2 ̆ 2 light 2 ̆ 2 of the heavenly bodies, is India 2 ̆ 7 s system of divination, which investigates how heavenly lights affect human life. Jyotish helps to achieve the four main goals of life: dharma (social and religious duty), artha (acquiring wealth), kama (love and worldly enjoyment), and moksha (liberation). Through the jyotish system of examination one can understand the karmic unfoldments in those four areas as well as learn the ways to improve them. Jyotish also can be described as a model of reality 2 ̆ 2 which interprets the observed conditions of the cosmos at the time of an event in order to provide insight into the nature of that event. 2 ̆ 2 Jyotish is sometimes referred to, especially outside India, as 2 ̆ 2 Hindu astrology; 2 ̆ 2 this term, however, is misleadingly sectarian, for jyotish is also practiced by Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Muslims and Christians, in many countries other than India. At the same time, jyotish is Hindu astrology {{in the sense that it}} is an outgrowth of Hinduism, and is an intrinsic part of India 2 ̆ 7 s religious and cultural experience. Jyotish is still as integral to the lives of India 2 ̆ 7 s common people as are the prayers, rituals, pilgrimages, and other religious ceremonies that jyotish helps to time. Considering the pervasiveness of jyotish in India, as well as its noticeable recent rise in popularity in the West, the scarcity of western scholarship on the subject is surprising. David Pingree was one of the few western scholars who examined and studied the history of jyotish. Studying primary texts, Pingree produced excellent work on the history, transmission, and development of jyotish. Pingree was mostly interested in the transmission and development of the exact sciences such as mathematics, astronomy and astrology. Even though today astrology is not considered a science, it was viewed as such in the past. In fact, astrology began to disappear from European universities as late as the 17 th century. The discussion of what 2 ̆ 2 science 2 ̆ 2 is deserves much more attention and research that goes beyond the scope of the present thesis. However, one obvious point is that when we cross the boundaries of time and cultures the concept of 2 ̆ 2 science 2 ̆ 2 considerably changes. When western scholars approach an ancient eastern system, they largely focus on jyotish 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 scientific 2 ̆ 2 aspect, placing it among disciplines such as mathematics, medicine, and astronomy (modern day scientific classification). Martin Gansten, for instance claims that, 2 ̆ 2 The pride of place thus given to astrology is presumably due at least in part to its scientific character, by which I mean not only because of its complexity and systematic nature, but above all its claims to objectivity. 2 ̆ 2 Jyotish 2 ̆ 7 s claim to objectivity derives from the fact that the planetary positions at a person 2 ̆ 7 s birth may be calculated any number of times by different astrologers, with, at least in theory, identical results. Thus, Gansten argues that a personal ability on the part of the astrologer to apply the various rules of interpretation is called forth, but this is predominantly an intellectual skill, rather than a mystical or magical one. Another key factor that contributes to the scientific categorization of jyotish derives from the Hindu tradition itself. The Kalpa Sutra texts, composed between the eight and fourth centuries BCE, and concerned with ritual and law, place jyotish among the auxiliary sciences, known as the 2 ̆ 7 limbs of the Veda 2 ̆ 7 (vedanga). Its placement among the Vedangas - which consist of the correct pronunciation of Vedic texts (siksa), the correct performance of ritual (kalpa), the study of grammar (vyakarana), etymology of Vedic words (nirukta), and prosody (chandas) - also an invites analytical perception of jyotish. Jyotish 2 ̆ 7 s affiliation to science cannot be underestimated since the very base of it lies in the rigorous knowledge of spherical astronomy (gola) and astronomical calculations (ganita). There are different systems of horoscope calculations. For example, one of the major divisions in zodiacal measurement is the difference between the tropical zodiac (utilized by Western astrologers) and the sidereal zodiac (utilized by Eastern astrologers). Despite the differences in systems, however, the calculations of astronomical data are strictly objective. That objectivity allowed computerization of the complex astronomical and mathematical calculations that had to be done manually in antiquity. Today, anyone who has an access to a computer can obtain a basic astrological program, downloading it for free from the internet, or buying a more complex version from a specialized vendor. However, access to the calculations, no matter how accurate, does not provide one with the correct understanding of an astrological chart. The technical calculations are only a preliminary step that leads to the more complex aspect of jyotish astrology - interpretation. Just as there are different systems of calculation, there are different styles of interpretation. The chief styles of jyotish are: Nadi jyotish, Parashari jyotish, Jaimini jyotish, Tantric jyotish, and Tajika jyotish; each style retains its distinctive character and capabilities, though they have repeatedly influenced each other over the centuries. The variety of approaches leads to differences and sometimes even to contradictions between chart interpretations. However, the intricacy and inconsistency of interpretations cannot be solely ascribed to the differences in astrological styles. It is not rare to encounter contradictory predictions made by astrologers from the same astrological school. The reason may be that as in any other branch of knowledge there are knowledgeable people and there are others who simply imitate expertise in order to gain a profit. The true reason, however, according to tradition, lies much deeper. The source of interpretations 2 ̆ 7 inconsistency is rooted in myth. As we should see further, myth plays a central role in Hindu culture, and many important phenomena such as cosmological data, archetypal material, cultural and social taboos, medical information, and spiritual and mystical matters were elucidated by it. According to one of the astrological myths, in ancient times the divine couple Siva and Parvati, inflamed great curiosity among people. Since their relationship was charged with volcanic passion, knowing its details was very entertaining. At that time, the all seeing eye of jyotish was so powerful that with its help, astrologers were able to perceive all the intimate details of the divine couple 2 ̆ 7 s daily life. For amusement, people would come to the astrologers to hear those details. When Siva discovered that astrologers had brazenly intruded into his personal life, he became furious and cursed all the astrologers. Since then, Siva 2 ̆ 7 s wrath has not permitted astrologers to interpret horoscopes identically and agree with each other on astrological interpretations. Their ability to obtain omniscience with the help of jyotish was lost forever. With or without considering Siva 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>curse</b> it is easy to see how astrological combinations may lead to contradictory interpretations and how different astrologers looking at the same chart may give polar opposite interpretations. For example, it is not unusual to find six planetary indications for prosperity and another six for poverty in the same chart. In this situation, the astrologer 2 ̆ 7 s ability to look beyond the mere calculations is called forth; intuition or divine insight is vital for the correct interpretation. Genuine astrologers have to use rational methods and intuitive powers to complement one another, and only those who become adept at both these approaches to divination can ever become fit receptacles for the Jyotir Vidya (the 2 ̆ 2 Lore of Light 2 ̆ 2). An important practice that develops divine intuition is devotion. Therefore, it would be wrong to limit jyotish to a strictly scientific domain, ignoring an essential part of mastery in interpretation that, as we shall see, is very tightly connected to devotion. Without denying the scientific aspect of jyotish astrology, I will illuminate another very important aspect of it - devotion. Like many other divinatory Hindu practices, jyotish astrology is immersed in religion, and by overlooking that fact, we fail to perceive the full picture of jyotish. By exploring the close links between jyotish astrology and Hindu religious practice, I argue that attending to those connections is a more holistic way to perceive jyotish astrology. This approach does not limit the jyotish system solely to an intellectual domain; it allows space for religious and mystical experiences. Examining philosophical and methodological aspects of this ancient divinatory practice, I will show that it is impossible to fully understand the jyotish astrological system without considering its connection to devotion...|$|R
40|$|According to the {{resource}} curse thesis (RCT) of the 1990 s, {{a strand of}} development discourse informed by neoliberal development economics, natural resource-rich developing countries are cursed by their natural resources abundance, particularly minerals and petroleum. Based on comparative statistics collected from the 1970 s to the 1990 <b>s,</b> {{the resource}} <b>curse</b> theorists claim that natural resources-rich developing countries have performed very poorly {{in terms of economic}} growth leading to industrialisation and improvement in social welfare compared to resource-poor developing countries at similar stage of development such as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea. The resource curse theorists argue that, contrary to the assumptions of modernisation theory of the 1940 s and 1950 s that natural resources abundance would lead to rapid capital accumulation that would then lead to rapid industrialisation and usher in a stage of sustained economic growth, resource-rich developing countries have experienced regressive economic growth trends, systemic corruption, civil wars, political instability, and general decline in the standard of living and social wellbeing. The resource curse theorists thus assume that resource-poor developing countries prospered because they pursued 'free market' and export-oriented policies such as open trade while resources-rich developing countries sought 'autarkic' (heavily regulated) policies that led to their regression. Therefore, these theorists conclude that the solution to the resource curse is 'free market' policies epitomised by the Washington Consensus. This thesis critically examines the RCT from a political economy standpoint and establishes that the resource curse effects are the same outcome described by political economists in the 1950 s and 1960 s as the underdevelopment of development. The difference in the choice of words to describe the same effects stems from the ideological standpoint from which Third World poverty and underdevelopment is discussed. To the resource curse theorists viewing from the standpoint of neoliberalism, internal factors such as political corruption, rent seeking, lack of transparency and good governance cause the resource curse. To the political economists on the other hand, external factors such as the volatility of world commodity prices, capital flight, tax evasion, colonialism, imperialism, neocolonialism and globalisation cause underdevelopment. This thesis establishes that both external and internal factors contribute to the poverty and underdevelopment of Third World countries. One of the external factors is the legal regime imposed through colonialism. Colonial laws have effectively divested indigenous peoples of their ownership and property rights in natural resources, which the neo-colonial nation-states retained upon independence, which are then transferred to transnational corporations in exchange for licence fees and non-controlling equity. Local ruling elites and foreign capitalists share the resources wealth, leaving the majority impoverished and their countries underdeveloped. Chapters 10 and 11 examine Papua New Guinea's legal regime to demonstrate this point. The thesis concludes that the solution to the resource curse or underdevelopment is for natural resources-rich developing countries to reform their laws to allow majority ownership and control in their citizens and adopt policies that the now developed countries adopted and followed when they were at similar stage of development. These policies are the 'autarkic' policies rejected by the resource curse theorists but recommended by the political economists of the underdevelopment discourse. ...|$|R
40|$|Este estudo analisa três obras dramáticas de Sam Shepard: Curse of the Starving Class, Buried Child e Fool for Love dentro do contexto de sua obsessão compartilhada com o sonho {{americano}} sobre uma família harmoniosa mostrando um desvio do sonho o que também é predominante em peças de dramaturgos americanos, como OŃeill e Miller, que antecedem Sam Shepard. Este estudo também investiga o conceito da identidade americana nas peças. Entre os trabalhos do dramaturgo Sam Shepard encontramos três peças que exploram o que significa ser o membro de uma família do meio oeste americano. Em Curse of the Starving Class, Buried Child, Shepard retrata a dor ecoando dentro do círculo familiar. Assim como os trabalhos iniciais de Shepard, essas peças familiares se revelam com um forte elemento biográfico, nascidas das experiências pessoais e persistentes preocupações do dramaturgo; através das peças, ele examina e reexamina o sistema familiar multigeracional do qual ele é oriundo. Por exemplo, o alcoolismo do pai e a forma como os pais são construídos em suas peças, a partir de uma perspectiva pessoal, são muito mais do que simples características das personagens, são uma condição que afeta a todos os personagens, seu relacionamento interpessoal e seus destinos. Além disso, podemos observar que o sonho americano, e sua relação com essa instabilidade familiar é um dos temas recorrentes nos dramas escritos pelo autor. Outra intenção deste estudo é, num primeiro momento analisar, o sonho americano sob uma perspectiva histórica para definir suas múltiplas facetas desde os tempos coloniais até o século XX, tal como apresentado no drama; em segundo lugar em um nível temático para identificar os vários temas que Sam Shepard usa em suas peças, tais como laços familiares adulterados, alienação, incapacidade de se comunicar, a violência, a relação esposa-amante surreal, e a busca de identidade e assim definir como eles impedem a realização do sonho; em terceiro lugar, as características usadas por Sam Shepard, que servem para apresentar as peças como instâncias do sonho de uma família harmoniosa tornando-se um pesadelo. Na peça Fool for Love analiso também a tirania exercida pela família sobre as vidas das suas crianças crescidas. De 1977 até 1985, Shepard distancia-se da aceitação fatalística e desse modo revela mudanças tanto na perspectiva autoral como no ambiente social. Como ele faz frequentemente em seus trabalhos, Shepard reflete o comportamento de uma época. This study analyzes three dramatic {{works of}} Sam Shepard: Curse of the Starving Class, Buried Child and Fool for Love {{within the context}} of their shared obsession with the American dream of a harmonious family showing a deviation of the dream which is also predominant in plays of American playwrights such as OŃeill and Miller, preceding Sam Shepard. This study also investigates the concept of American identity in the plays. Among the works of playwright Sam Shepard there are three plays that explore {{what it means to be}} a member of a family in the U. <b>S.</b> Midwest. In <b>Curse</b> of the Starving Class, Buried Child, Shepard portrays the pain echoing within the family. As the initial work of Shepard, these family plays reveal themselves with a strong biographical element, born of personal experience and persistent concerns of the playwright, through the plays, he examines and reviews the multigenerational family system of which he also derives from. For example, the fatherś alcoholism and how the fathers of his plays are constructed from a personal perspective are much more than simple features of the characters, it is a condition that affects all the characters, their relationships and their interpersonal destinations. In addition, we note that the American dream and its relationship with that family instability is one of the recurring themes in dramas written by the author. Another aim of this study is, at first look at the American dream from a historical perspective to define its many facets from colonial times to the twentieth century, as depicted in the drama, and secondly on a thematic level to identify the various themes Sam Shepard uses in his plays, such as family ties tampered with, alienation, inability to communicate, violence, wife-lover surreal relationship, and the search for identity and to define how they prevent the fulfillment of the d́ream,́ and finally, the features used by Sam Shepard, which serve to make the plays as instances of the d́reamóf a harmonious family becoming a nightmare. In the play Fool for Love we also analyze the tyranny exercised by the family on the lives of their grown children. From 1977 until 1985, Shepard is away from the fatalistic acceptance and thereby reveals changes in both the authorial perspective and the social environment. As he does often in his work, Shepard reflects the behavior of an era...|$|R
