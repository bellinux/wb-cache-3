5|$|Terphenylquinones are {{chemical}} compounds that are widely distributed among the Basidiomycetes division of fungi. Ascocoryne sarcoides {{has been shown}} to contain a terphenylquinone named ascocorynin—a chemical derivative of the compound benzoquinone. This pigment, when in alkaline solution, turns a dark violet, similar in color to the fruit bodies of the fungus. Ascocorynin has moderate antibiotic activity, and was shown in laboratory tests to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria, including the widely distributed food spoilage organism Bacillus stearothermophilus; however, it has no effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> on Gram-negative bacteria, nor does it have any anti-fungal activity.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, {{research}} {{started in}} the Soviet Union and the US <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> of diamond by pyrolysis of hydrocarbon gases at the relatively low temperature of 800°C. This low-pressure process is known as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). William G. Eversole reportedly achieved vapor deposition of diamond over diamond substrate in 1953, {{but it was not}} reported until 1962. Diamond film deposition was independently reproduced by Angus and coworkers in 1968 and by Deryagin and Fedoseev in 1970. Whereas Eversole and Angus used large, expensive, single-crystal diamonds as substrates, Deryagin and Fedoseev succeeded in making diamond films on non-diamond materials (silicon and metals), which led to massive research on inexpensive diamond coatings in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Limnoperdon is a fungal genus in the {{monotypic}} family Limnoperdaceae. The genus is also monotypic, as {{it contains}} a single species, the aquatic fungus Limnoperdon incarnatum. The species, described as new to science in 1976, produces fruit bodies that lack specialized structures such as a stem, cap and gills common in mushrooms. Rather, the fruit bodies—described as aquatic or floating puffballs—are small balls (0.5–1mm diameter) of loosely interwoven hyphae. The balls float {{on the surface of}} the water above submerged twigs. Experimental observations on the development of the fruit body, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> on the fungus in pure culture, suggest that a thin strand of mycelium tethers the ball above water while it matures. Fruit bodies start out as a tuft of hyphae, then become cup-shaped, and eventually enclose around a single chamber that contains reddish spores. Initially discovered in a marsh in the state of Washington, the fungus has since been collected in Japan, South Africa, and Canada.|$|E

5|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{can cause}} adverse effects and even death, whether by side-effects of their active substances, by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. Many such effects are known, while others {{remain to be}} explored scientifically. There {{is no reason to}} presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like atropine and nicotine shows this to be untrue. Further, the high standards applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant medicines, and dose can vary widely depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than young ones, for instance.|$|E
5|$|The lone {{surviving}} Pipe roll from Henry I's reign, that of 1130, {{has been}} a popular subject of study. Recent investigations include Judith Green's search for evidence of Henry's financial system. Another historian, Stephanie Mooers Christelow, has studied the roll along with those from the reign of Henry II, looking for the exemptions and grants made by both kings to various royal favourites. Christelow has also studied the 1130 roll to see what light it can shine on Henry I's judicial system, as well as <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> of royal courts during Henry's reign. The historian C. Warren Hollister used the 1130 Pipe roll to study the rewards of royal service during Henry's reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} history of Greece {{between the end}} of the second Persian invasion of Greece and the Peloponnesian War (479–431 BC) is not well supported by surviving ancient sources. This period, sometimes referred to as the pentekontaetia (πεντηκονταετία, the Fifty Years) by ancient writers, was a period of relative peace and prosperity within Greece. The richest source for the period, and also the most contemporaneous, is Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, which is generally considered by modern historians to be a reliable primary account. Thucydides only mentions this period in a digression <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> of Athenian power in the run up to the Peloponnesian War, and the account is brief, probably selective and lacks any dates. Nevertheless, Thucydides's account can be, and is, used by historians to draw up a skeleton chronology for the period, on to which details from archaeological records and other writers can be superimposed.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND. Diabetes in {{pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} both accelerated fetal growth and intrauterine growth restriction. OBJECTIVE. To compare the difference in occurrence of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses in a pregnant diabetic population using population-based growth charts and customised growth charts. METHODS. Retrospective observational study at Steve Biko Academic and Kalafong hospitals, Pretoria, South Africa. Information from an electronic database was used to retrospectively generate customised centiles using a web-based tool (www. gestation. net). <b>The</b> first fetal <b>growth</b> scan of <b>the</b> third trimester, as determined by ultrasound, was plotted for each patient <b>on</b> both <b>the</b> population-based and customised growth charts. We compared <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> category <b>on</b> <b>the</b> population-based <b>growth</b> chart with that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> customised <b>growth</b> chart. RESULTS. Of the patients, 44 had type 1, 66 type 2 and 173 gestational diabetes. <b>The</b> <b>growth</b> of 79 / 283 fetuses would have been reclassified had customised growth charts been used. Of cases in which fetal growth was classified as appropriate for gestation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> populationbased <b>growth</b> charts, 58 fetuses would have been LGA and 14 SGA had customised growth charts been used. Four of the fetuses that were SGA and three that were LGA <b>on</b> <b>the</b> population-based <b>growth</b> charts would have been classified as appropriately grown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> customised <b>growth</b> charts. This was {{a statistically significant difference}} (p< 0. 001), with a Cohen’s kappa of 0. 45 indicating moderate agreement. CONCLUSIONS. Customised growth charts identified more babies with aberrations of growth, who may need vigilant antenatal care and elective delivery and may be at increased health risk in the future.
