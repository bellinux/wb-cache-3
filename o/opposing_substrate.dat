40|$|The {{development}} of thermal interface materials (TIMs) is necessitated by the temperature drop across interfacing materials arising from macro and microscopic irregularities of their surfaces that constricts heat through small contact regions {{as well as}} mismatches in their thermal properties. Similar to other types of TIMs, CNT TIMs alleviate the thermal resistance across the interface by thermally bridging two materials together with cylindrical, high-aspect ratio, and nominally vertical conducting elements. Within the community of TIM engineers, the vision driving the {{development of}} CNT TIMs was born from measurements that revealed impressively high thermal conductivities of individual CNTs. This vision was then projected to efforts focused on packing many individual CNTs on a single substrate that efficiently conduct heat in parallel and ultimately through many contact regions at CNT-to-substrate contacts. ^ This thesis encompasses a comprehensive investigation of the viability of carbon nanotube based thermal interface materials (CNT TIMs) to efficiently conduct heat across two contacting materials. The efforts in this work were initially devoted to engaging CNT TIMs with an <b>opposing</b> <b>substrate</b> using two bonding techniques. Using palladium hexadecanethiolate, Pd(SC 16 H 35) 2 the CNT ends were bonded to an <b>opposing</b> <b>substrate</b> (one-sided interface) or opposing CNT array (two-sided interface) to enhance contact conductance while maintaining a compliant joint. The palladium weld is particularly attractive for its mechanical stability at high temperatures. The engagement of CNT TIMs with an <b>opposing</b> <b>substrate</b> was also achieved by inserting a solder foil between the CNT TIM and <b>opposing</b> <b>substrate</b> and subsequently raising {{the temperature of the}} interface above the eutectic point of the solder foil. This bonding technique creates a strong weld that not only reduces the thermal resistance significantly but also minimizes the change in thermal resistance with an applied compressive load. The thermal performance was further improved by infiltrating the CNT TIM with paraffin wax, which serves as an alternate pathway for heat conduction across the interface that ultimately reduces the bulk thermal resistance of the CNT TIM. ^ For CNT TIMs synthesized at the Birck Nanotechnology Center at Purdue University, the thermal resistance was shown to scale linearly with their aggregate, as-grown height. Thus, the bulk thermal resistance can alternatively be tuned by adjusting the as-grown height. The linear relationship between thermal resistance and CNT TIM height provides a simple and efficient methodology to estimate the contact resistance and effective thermal conductivity of CNT TIMs. In this work, the contact resistance and effective thermal conductivity were estimated using two measurement techniques: (i) one-dimensional, steady-state reference bar and (ii) photoacoustic technique. A discrepancy in the estimated contact resistance exists between the two measurement techniques, which is due to the difficulty in measuring the true contact area. In contrast, the effective thermal conductivities estimated from both measurement techniques moderately agreed and were estimated to be on the order of O(1 W/mK). ^ The final chapter is in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories and focuses on the development of an apparatus to measure the thermal conductivity of insulation materials critical for the operation of molten salt batteries. Molten salt batteries are particularly useful power sources for radar and guidance systems in military applications such as guided missiles, ordinance, and other weapons. Molten salt batteries are activated by raising the temperature of the electrolyte above its melting temperature using pyrotechnic heat pellets. The battery will remain active as long as the electrolyte is molten. As a result, the thermal processes within the components and interactions between them are critical to the overall performance of molten salt batteries. A molten salt battery is typically thermally insulated using wrappable and board-like insulation materials such as Fiberfrax wrap, Fiberfrax board, and Min-K insulation. The Fiberfrax board and Min-K insulation are composites of alumino-silicate and fumed silica-titania, respectively. In Chapter 9, the thermal conductivities of the Fiberfrax board and Min-K insulation were measured under different uniaxial compressive states and ambient environments. The thermal conductivity of the mixed separator pellets (LiCl/MgO/KCl) was also measured along with its contact resistances with interfacing members. To measure the thermal quantities, a steady-state reference bar with thermocouples was employed. The resulting values serve as inputs to a thermal model that aims to predict lifetimes of the batteries. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.) ...|$|E

An array of long, parallel electrodes is flush-mounted into each <b>opposing</b> <b>substrate</b> face of a narrow gap interface, and exposed to the gap formed between the two surfaces. Electrodes are oriented such that their lengthwise dimension in one substrate runs perpendicular to those in the other. A capacitance measurement taken between opposing electrodes is used to characterize the interface region in the vicinity of their crossing point (junction). The electric field associated with each electrode junction is numerically simulated and analyzed. Criteria are developed for the design of electrode junction geometries that localize the electric fields. The capacitances between floating-ground electrodes in the electrode sensor configuration employed give rise to a nontrivial network of interacting capacitances which strongly influence the measured response at any junction. A generalized solution for analyzing the floating network response is presented. The technique is used to experimentally detect thermal grease spots of 0. 2 mm to 1. 8 mm diameter within a 25 lm interface gap.

Loss of material due to subsurface fatigue could not be demonstrated with a contact pressure of 45 MPa at which the experiments were performed.

40|$|In this work, capacitance-based sensing is {{investigated}} for characterizing the morphology of dielectric inhomogeneities in high aspect-ratio planar domains. The work {{is motivated by}} the need for in situ experimental characterization of void development in a layer of dielectric thermal interface material under realistic operating conditions. The sensing methods are applicable to phase characterization in other media such as polymer sheets or dielectric fluids in narrow microfluidic channels. ^ First, an orthogonal mesh sensor configuration is investigated, which requires a rake of embedded electrodes in each of two confining substrates. Substrates are oriented to create a grid of crossing points. Capacitance measurements at each crossing point are used to interrogate the material under test (MUT). In an electrically floating configuration, the system {{gives rise to a}} nontrivial capacitance network, which must be solved in reverse to correctly map inhomogeneities. In a grounded configuration, electrodes other than the active pair are maintained at virtual ground during each measurement. Detection of inhomogeneities approximately 200 ?m in diameter are demonstrated in thin (25 – 250 µm) MUTs. Next, a sensor configuration with an array of electrodes in one substrate and a single large electrode on the <b>opposing</b> <b>substrate</b> is investigated. When the MUT is comparatively thick (~ 1 mm), capacitance measurements taken between neighboring coplanar pairs in the array and between facing pairs also provide useful information. Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) using this setup is demonstrated on a 1. 27 mm-thick MUT. Alternatively, when the MUT is thin (? 200 ?m), measurements between coplanar pairs do not provide useful information, but measurements obtained from opposing pairs may be used to reconstruct a map of non-uniform MUT thickness, as might occur due to substrate tilting or warpage, in addition to a map of local void content. Reconstruction of both thickness and voiding maps in a thermal grease confined by tilted substrates is demonstrated experimentally. ^ A theoretical investigation of the effectiveness of double-sided electrode configurations for thick MUTs is also conducted. Simulated tomography is conducted using different electrode designs patterns. It is shown that an optimum electrode size may be identified, which depends on signal-to-noise ratio of the system. Patterns with a lateral offset between the arrays are generally superior to their aligned counterparts. ^ Throughout this investigation of the capacitive sensing methods, image reconstruction algorithms are developed which are tailored to the different sensor types. A level-set shape reconstruction algorithm for mapping local void fractions is developed, which dramatically improves visualization compared to a map of tessellated, grayscaled void fractions. A strictly binary image algorithm for ECT on large meshes is developed, termed the shape-energy evolution reconstruction (SEER) algorithm. The SEER algorithm developed in this work provides an efficient methodology for reconstructing purely binary images while forcefully regularizing the image reconstruction process in severely underdetermined systems. Next, an explicitly regularized solution for general ECT, sensitivity factor regularization (SFR), is presented. The SFR algorithm is shown to perform better than other explicit methods, including linear back projection and Tikhonov regularization, and is ideal for conducting design studies on 2 D systems using electrode density as a design variable. Also, a distinguishing algorithm is developed for obtaining maps of both of MUT thickness and void content over the footprint of a joint from a single map of capacitance measurements. ...|$|E
40|$|Because {{of their}} high thermal {{conductivity}} and excellent mechanical properties, carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays have emerged as a promising class of materials to enhance thermal interface conductance. However, traditional measurement techniques suffer larger errors when used to characterize the thermal performance of such high conductance structures, and {{little is known about}} the effects of CNT array morphology on thermal performance. Additionally, integrating CNT arrays with technically relevant substrates and functional devices and modeling thermal performance remain as significant challenges. In this dissertation, a photoacoustic (PA) technique was developed to measure precisely the resistances of various CNT array thermal interfaces directly synthesized on substrates of technical interest such as Si, SiC, diamond, and Cu. The PA technique was used to measure the total thermal resistances of interfaces with CNT arrays grown on one and both sides of the interface. The two-sided interface achieved a very low resistance of 4 mm 22 ̆ 6 dot;K/W at moderate pressures. The total resistances of other interfaces that consist of CNT arrays synthesized on the surfaces of insertable metal foils were measured using the PA technique, and structures with arrays synthesized on both sides of Cu foil achieved values as low as 8 mm 22 ̆ 6 dot;K/W. The local CNT-substrate resistances and the intrinsic resistance of the CNT arrays in the one-sided, two-sided, and CNT/foil configurations were measured with the PA technique. The CNT-substrate resistances were observed to dominate the total resistances of each structure, and, for the one-side configuration, the resistances at the free CNT ends were measured to be an order of magnitude higher that the resistances between CNTs and their growth substrate. To reduce resistance at this thermal bottleneck, a wicking technique was developed to add consistent amounts of paraffin wax to the free ends of CNT arrays, and resistance values as low as 2 mm 22 ̆ 6 dot;K/W were achieved. A templated catalyst structure and microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) was used to grow CNT arrays from 500 to 800 °C with systematic control over defect density, CNT number density, and CNT diameter. Reduced CNT diameter and number density were revealed to produce higher thermal resistances because of less interface contact and reduced phonon transmission at small diameter CNT contacts, and increased defect density was revealed to produce lower thermal resistances because of enhanced array compliance. The performances of CNT/foil and wax/CNT/foil interface materials were tested for more than 1000 thermo-mechanical cycles in a burn-in process employed by the Intel Corporation. The thermal resistances of the CNT/foil interfaces exhibited excellent durability and resilience over the test range and for a large sample set. ^ A model was developed to predict the thermal contact resistance of CNT array interfaces with CNT arrays synthesized directly on substrate surfaces. An analytical model for contact mechanics was first developed in conjunction with prior data from load-displacement experiments to predict the real contact area established in CNT array interfaces as a function of applied pressure. The contact mechanics model was integrated with a detailed thermal model that treats the multitude of individual CNT-substrate contacts as parallel resistors and considers the effects on phonon transport in the confined geometries that exist at such contacts. The influence of CNT array properties, e. g. diameter and density, are explicitly incorporated into the thermal model, which agrees well with experimental measurements of thermal resistances as a function of pressure for different types of interfaces. The model reveals that: (1) ballistic thermal resistance dominates at the CNT array interface; (2) the overall performance of CNT array interfaces is most strongly influenced by the thermal resistance at the contacts between free CNT ends and the <b>opposing</b> <b>substrate</b> surface (one-sided interface) or the opposing CNT array (two-sided interface); and (3) dense arrays with high mechanical compliance reduce the thermal contact resistance of CNT array interfaces by increasing the real contact area in the interface. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} heat {{transfer}} {{and the associated}} thermal interface resistance at heterogeneous material interfaces is over 70 years old since the first measurements of thermal interface resistance by Kapitza in 1941. However, recent developments in experimental metrology techniques that enable spectrally-resolved phonon transport measurements at the nanoscale along {{with the development of}} high-fidelity simulation methods have provided a renewed interest in the fundamental physics of heat transfer across interfaces. Miniaturized electronic devices and nanostructured materials for energy applications are among technologies that would benefit from a fundamental understanding of interfacial thermal transport. This dissertation focuses on the study of problems in interfacial heat transfer that span the atomistic and mesoscopic length scales and have broad applications in electronic thermal management. ^ The first part of this dissertation develops a mesoscale simulation framework to predict the mechanical and thermal performance of carbon nanotube (CNT) thermal interface materials (TIMs). CNT arrays have been widely studied for use as TIMs due to the high thermal conductivity and mechanical compliance of CNTs. However, modeling of CNT TIMs has been largely limited to semi-empirical methods that lack detailed consideration of CNT array microstructure. We develop a physics-based, microstructure-sensitive, thermo-mechanical simulation framework {{that can be used in}} the design and optimization of CNT TIMs. Coarse-grain mechanics simulations are used to predict the CNT array microstructure and the finite volume method is used to solve the Fourier conduction equations for CNTs embedded in a filler matrix. The simulations provide insights on the sensitivity of thermal resistance of the CNT array to microscopic CNT-CNT and CNT-substrate contact resistances. Microstructural parameters that are not readily accessible in experiments such as the contact areas and the fraction of CNTs in contact with the <b>opposing</b> <b>substrate</b> are reported to demonstrate the usefulness of the simulation approach. ^ The latter part of this dissertation deals with the development of a first-principles atomistic simulation framework to study heat transfer across metal-semiconductor heterojunctions which form an important class of interfaces used in electronic devices. The silicides of transition metals such as titanium and cobalt (TiSi 2, CoSi 2) are commonly used as metal contacts to silicon in transistors; hence, TiSi 2 -Si and CoSi 2 -Si interfaces are chosen here as model metal-semiconductor junctions for studies of thermal transport. All the atomistic simulations reported in this work use the atomistic Green 2 ̆ 7 s function (AGF) method that is analogous to the non-equilibrium Green 2 ̆ 7 s function (NEGF) method used in quantum transport calculations of electrons. We propose the use of Büttiker probe scattering models to develop a phenomenological but computationally efficient description of phonon-phonon and electron-phonon scattering within the AGF framework. ^ First-principles calculations of electron-phonon coupling reveal that energy transfer between metal electrons and lattice vibrations in the semiconductor is mediated by interfacial phonon modes whose vibrational pattern is delocalized across the metal and semiconductor regions, and the coupling of metal electrons with phonon modes localized in the semiconductor is negligible. The transport simulations also help identify the contributions of various scattering mechanisms such as elastic interfacial scattering, inelastic phonon scattering, electron-phonon coupling within the metal, and direct electron-phonon coupling across the interface to the total thermal conductance of a CoSi 2 -Si interface. ^ The inclusion of the various transport processes in the simulation is found to be critical to obtain a good agreement with experimental data on thermal conductance of an epitaxial CoSi 2 -Si interface. The last part of this work develops an eigenspectrum formulation of the AGF method that enables the prediction of polarization- or branch-resolved contributions to the phonon transmission function and the thermal interface conductance. Unlike prior work in the literature, our approach makes a direct connection to the bulk phonon dispersion of materials forming an interface and is also computationally efficient. The essential idea behind the formulation is the use of bulk phonon eigenspectrum to obtain the surface Green 2 ̆ 7 s functions used in the AGF method instead of the more commonly used Sancho-Rubio or decimation technique. The new approach is applied to study phonon transport across a Si-Ge interface with atomic intermixing. The computation of polarization-resolved transmission functions, which are not accessible within the conventional AGF method that groups different phonon branches together, provides insights on the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the increase in phonon transmission due to interfacial disorder. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we aim to}} improve thermal {{transport}} in three types of materials: vertical arrays of polymer nanotubes, polymer thin films, and vertical arrays of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In addition to developing new materials, we examine ways to extend several existing photothermal techniques for better measurements of nanostructured materials. Vertically aligned arrays of polymer nanotubes are synthesized through electrochemical polymerization, and melt processing. In both cases the vertically aligned arrays are created using a nanoporous template with pore sizes ranging from 50 to 200 nm. It is found that the nanopores induce alignment of polymer chains {{in the direction of}} the pore axis, which creates large enhancements in thermal conductivity. For amorphous polythiophene nanofibers the thermal conductivity was up to 4. 4 W/m-K, up to 20 times higher than bulk. Polyethylene nanofibers were melt infiltrated into 200 nm templates, and the thermal conductivity was as high as ~ 10 W/m-K based on in-template measurements. The vertical arrays of polymer nanotubes are joined to opposing surfaces to create thermal interface materials (TIMs) and the total thermal resistance was as low as 10 mm 2 -K/W shown to be thermally stable at elevated temperatures. In addition the thermal conductivity of conjugated polymer thin films is measured using Time Domain Thermoreflectance (TDTR) and the photoacoustic technique for thin (~ 100 nm) films and thick (~ 10 μm) films and it is found that Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), highly anisotropic electrical conductivity leads to only small increases in through-plane thermal conductivity, despite high in-plane electrical conductivity of 2000 S/cm. In poly(3 -hexylthiophene- 2, 5 -diyl) the addition of 10 wt. % of a heavy dopant molecule was found to decrease the thermal conductivity by nearly a factor of two. Individual carbon nanotubes possess high thermal conductivity although when grown in a vertical array their thermal conductivity is drastically reduced. A method for the direct measurement of the effective thermal conductivity of CNT arrays is presented using the photoacoustic technique. In addition, new data analysis is applied to time domain thermoreflectance to measure the contact resistance between CNT free tips and <b>opposing</b> <b>substrates.</b> Lastly, vertically aligned CNT forests are infiltrated with PEDOT:PSS to reduce the contact resistance and increase the thermal conductivity.

Habitat preferences were determined by pitfall trapping and radio-tracking studies, and a comparison of catchments with and without chevron skinks. Over {{the course of the}} research, 88 skinks were encountered. Significantly more skinks were caught in pitfall traps set in stream habitat than in alluvial terrace, boulder bank or ridge habitat. Eight chevron skinks were radio-tracked for periods between three and eight days, and 118 fixes were taken from 55 different retreat sites. When compared with randomly selected sites, chevron skinks {{were more likely to be}} found at sites that had crevices, debris dams and trees than those that did not. The further a site was away from the stream edge, the less likely it was to be a chevron skink retreat site. Chevron skinks were more likely to be found in catchments with narrow streams with rocky, as <b>opposed</b> to silty, <b>substrates.</b> We recommend that future management of chevron skinks incorporate sites that contain mature forest and rocky streams.

40|$|Durable {{adhesion}} {{of repair}} material on concrete substrate requires compatibility between the materials to be bonded. There are four main compatibility components {{to be addressed}} in any concrete repair scenario: dimensional, permeability, chemical and electrochemical compatibility. Among those, dimensional compatibility is often prevalent: while a cement-base repair material inevitably undergoes shrinkage, the <b>substrate</b> <b>opposes</b> to its free movement, a situation that can lead to cracking and, subsequently, promote debonding. Besides, an essential requirement for bond development is the creation of the interface itself: the intimate contact between the repair system and concrete substrate is required in order to maximize adhesion. Adequate compaction of the new layer is consequently one of the main parameters that will govern the quality of the bond: sufficient vibration or specific rheological properties for the repair material are needed. Self-Compacting Repair Mortar (SCRM) can be advantageously used in many repair situations. Limestone fillers seem to offer interesting advantages as addition to these repair materials as they increase the workability of the final product. Several materials have been tested and characterised by means of a physical, chemical and mechanical characterization test program: specific attention has been given to water demand and superplasticizer efficiency.

40|$|Previous robotic sample return {{missions}} lacked in situ sample verification/ quantity measurement instruments. Therefore, {{the outcome}} of the mission remained unclear until spacecraft return. In situ sample verification systems such as this Distributed Capacitive (DisC) sensor would enable an unmanned spacecraft system to re-attempt the sample acquisition procedures until the capture of desired sample quantity is positively confirmed, thereby maximizing the prospect for scientific reward. The DisC device contains a 10 -cm-diameter pressure-sensitive elastic membrane placed {{at the bottom of a}} sample canister. The membrane deforms under the weight of accumulating planetary sample. The membrane is positioned in close proximity to an <b>opposing</b> rigid <b>substrate</b> with a narrow gap. The deformation of the membrane makes the gap narrower, resulting in increased capacitance between the two parallel plates (elastic membrane and rigid substrate). C-V conversion circuits on a nearby PCB (printed circuit board) provide capacitance readout via LVDS (low-voltage differential signaling) interface. The capacitance method was chosen over other potential approaches such as the piezoelectric method because of its inherent temperature stability advantage. A reference capacitor and temperature sensor are embedded in the system to compensate for temperature effects. The pressure-sensitive membranes are aluminum 6061, stainless steel (SUS) 403, and metal-coated polyimide plates. The thicknesses of these membranes range from 250 to 500 m. The rigid substrate is made with a 1 - to 2 -mm-thick wafer of one of the following materials depending on the application requirements glass, silicon, polyimide, PCB substrate. The glass substrate is fabricated by a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication approach. Several concentric electrode patterns are printed on the substrate. The initial gap between the two plates, 100 m, is defined by a silicon spacer ring that is anodically bonded to the glass substrate. The fabricated proof-of-concept devices have successfully demonstrated tens to hundreds of picofarads of capacitance change when a simulated sample (100 g to 500 g) is placed on the membrane...|$|R
40|$|Asymmetric oxygen {{transport}} membranes (OTM) {{provide a}} low ionic {{resistance of the}} functional separation layer together with a high mechanical stability. Hence, they are promising candidates for high-permeation {{in a variety of}} high-temperature applications for the separation of oxygen from gas mixtures. However, the microstructure of the porous support in the membrane assembly affects the overall flux significantly [1]. In this work, the optimization of the porous support was studied by simulating numerically the effect of geometrical changes (pore size, pore geometry, substrate thicknesses) of the support on the overall flux, using different flow conditions (3 -end, 4 -end), and assembly orientation [2]. These effects were studied by applying the binary friction model (BFM) for the support together with a modified Wagner equation for the dense membrane using transport relevant parameters obtained from micro computed tomography data of a BSCF-Z support. Additionally, the effect of the support geometry and the depth of travel of the sweep gas on the permeated flux were investigated by computational fluid dynamics using Ansys Fluent. From the CFD simulation, u-shaped pores are more desirable for inverse tape cast porous support and enables quick removal of the permeated gas. Supports with elongated pores would be ideal for 4 -end mode (binary diffusion limited configurations/gas mixtures e. g. membrane reactors) transport, while for oxygen generation from air (3 -end), supports with either compressed or elongated pores are comparable (rel. difference < ~ 7 %). A relationship between the <b>opposing</b> factors <b>substrate</b> thickness and pore size was developed that ensures a given flux. This can be used to optimize support’s microstructure with regards to mechanical strength and permeability. [1] P. Niehoff, et al.

30|$|Transparent {{conducting}} oxide [TCO] {{films have}} been widely used as transparent electrodes in the field of optoelectronic devices. Specifically, they have been used in applications such as liquid crystal displays, organic light-emitting diodes, e-papers, and thin-film solar cells [1 – 4]. It is well known that the performance of such devices is closely related to the physical properties (for example, the electrical and optical properties) of the TCO [5]. Indium tin oxide [ITO] is the most widely used TCO because of its excellent electrical and optical characteristics. However, ITO requires high process temperatures (greater than 200 °C) in order to obtain these favorable characteristics. This is because an additional annealing treatment is needed to transform its structure from amorphous to poly-crystalline. Thus, it is difficult to apply ITO films onto flexible plastic substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate [PET], polyimide, polyethylene naphthalate, and polycarbonate because these polymer substrates have low glass transition temperatures [6]. In general, there are several disadvantages to fabricating ITO on plastic <b>substrates</b> as <b>opposed</b> to glass <b>substrates,</b> which can be fabricated with a relatively low treatment temperature. These disadvantages include low transmittance, low conductivity, and many defects. Therefore, the development of a low temperature process for depositing ITO onto plastic substrates is very important.|$|R

However, they are well known to suffer from capacity fading which is induced by loss of mechanical integrity during cycling. Among various nano-structured electrodes, nano-scale thin films deposited on thick substrates have been widely studied through experimental and theoretical methods. Experiments show that even nano-scale thin-film electrodes could undergo extensive fracture and delamination from the underneath current collector. In this paper, we examine the effect of interaction between chemical and mechanical driving forces on the solute distribution {{in the vicinity of the}} edge of an elastic semi-infinite nano-film which is bonded onto the surface of a thick elastic substrate. The film as <b>opposed</b> to the <b>substrate</b> is considered chemically active, and in chemical equilibrium with an external infinitely large mass reservoir which maintains a uniform chemical potential everywhere in the film.

The thermal plasma (T ˜ 10 000 K, p ˜ 0. 5 bar) will then expand supersonically into a vessel where the pressure can be varied between 0. 1 mbar and 100 mbar.

40|$|Previously {{published}} {{results from}} a novel, homogeneously distributed shear, tubular fermenter used to study continuous chemostat (high shear) and biofilm (low shear) fermentations (Brink and Nicol, 2014 a), were compared to results obtained in the same reactor at intermediate shear conditions as well as batch (biofilm) fermentations of Actinobacillus succinogenes. It {{was found that the}} steady-state volumetric production rates increased by nearly an order of magnitude (1. 8 g. L− 1. h− 1 vs 15 – 17 g. L− 1. h− 1) as the shear was reduced from the chemostat (1. 83 m. s− 1) to the lower shear biofilm conditions. The biofilm results indicated similar volumetric production rates for the different shear conditions, while the measured extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the biofilm exhibited a significant shear dependence; EPS fractions of 0. 50 ± 0. 05 g. g− 1 vs. 0. 16 ± 0. 02 g. g− 1 for the low and intermediate shear conditions respectively. The cell-based biofilm production rates were shown to be dependent on shear conditions at succinic acid titres less than the growth-maintenance boundary (10 g. L− 1), with a reduction in cellular production rate associated with an increase in shear. Under maintenance conditions the cell-based production rates appeared independent of the shear conditions in the fermenter, with the cell-based production rates decreasing with increasing succinic acid titres. The industrial implications are that for succinic acid titres in excess of 10 g. L- 1, the same mass of biomass under intermediate shear conditions should exhibit a greater volumetric production rate due to the higher fraction of cells as opposed to EPS. The initial values for the batch cell-based succinic acid production rates corresponded to the steady-state values for biofilms grown under the same continuous conditions. However, during transient operation the production rates exceeded the steady-state values; a lag in the product inhibition response was observed. The transient production rates eventually ceased at succinic acid titres in excess of approximately 60 – 72 g. L− 1; a residual glucose concentration of 20 g. L- 1 was measured at the highest succinic acid titre (72 g. L- 1), indicating product related inhibition as <b>opposed</b> to <b>substrate</b> depletion. The transient results indicate that a larger average cellbased production rate can be obtained during transient operation when compared to the steady fermentation conditions due to a lag in the succinic acid inhibition during transient operation.

However, it is unknown whether PVCs originating from the left ventricular septum, are effectively eliminated by RFCA. This study aimed to investigate electrophysiologic characteristics and effects of Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) for patients with symptomatic premature ventricular contraction (PVC) originating from the left ventricular septum without including fascicular PVCs. Methods Characteristics of body surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrophysiologic recordings endocardiogram in a successful RFCA target were analyzed in 20 patients with symptomatic PVCs originating from the left ventricular septum. RFCA was performed using pace mapping and activation mapping. Results The QRS morphology of PVCs originating from the left ventricular septum {{is similar to that}} seen in fascicular tachycardia. Most of the PVCs originated from the left septum appears in the form of ventricular parasystole. The incidence of ventricular parasystole was 70 %. Sustained ventricular tachycardia was not inducible by electrical stimulation and isoproterenol infusion in all 20 patients, ablation at the site recording the earliest Purkinje potential was not effective in all 20 patients, and Purkinje potentials were not identified at successful sites during point mapping. Sixteen patients were successful with RFCA using pace mapping and activation mapping, 3 failed, and 1 recurrent. Conclusion Although the ECG characteristics of the PVCs arising from the left ventricular septum are similar to that seen in fascicular tachycardia, the electrophysiologic characteristics are different between the two types of PVCs. The distinguishing characteristic of the PVCs is that Purkinje potentials were not present at the site of successful ablation, suggesting a myocardial as <b>opposed</b> to fascicular <b>substrate.</b> RFCA is an effective curative therapy for symptomatic PVCs originating from the left ventricular septum (not from the left anterior and posterior fascicle). </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 7 (NPP 7) is {{the only}} member of the {{mammalian}} NPP enzyme family that has been confirmed to act as a sphingomyelinase, hydrolyzing sphingomyelin (SM) to form phosphocholine and ceramide. NPP 7 additionally hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), a substrate preference shared with the NPP 2 /autotaxin(ATX) and NPP 6 mammalian family members. This study utilizes a synergistic combination of molecular modeling validated by experimental site-directed mutagenesis to explore the molecular basis for the unique ability of NPP 7 to hydrolyze SM. Results The catalytic function of NPP 7 against SM, LPC, platelet activating factor (PAF) and para-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine (pNPPC) is impaired in the F 275 A mutant relative to wild type NPP 7, but different impacts are noted for mutations at other sites. These results are consistent with a previously described role of F 275 to interact with the choline headgroup, where all substrates share a common functionality. The L 107 F mutation showed enhanced hydrolysis of LPC, PAF and pNPPC but reduced hydrolysis of SM. Modeling suggests this difference can be explained by the gain of cation-pi interactions with the choline headgroups of all four <b>substrates,</b> <b>opposed</b> by increased steric crowding against the sphingoid tail of SM. Modeling also revealed that the long and flexible hydrophobic tails of substrates exhibit considerable dynamic flexibility in the binding pocket, reducing the entropic penalty that might otherwise be incurred upon substrate binding. Conclusions Substrate recognition by NPP 7 includes several important contributions, ranging from cation-pi interactions between F 275 and the choline headgroup of all substrates, to tail-group binding pockets that accommodate the inherent flexibility of the lipid hydrophobic tails. Two contributions to the unique ability of NPP 7 to hydrolyze SM were identified. First, the second hydrophobic tail of SM occupies a second hydrophobic binding pocket. Second, the leucine residue present at position 107 contrasts with a conserved phenylalanine in NPP enzymes that do not utilize SM as a substrate, consistent with the observed reduction in SM hydrolysis by the NPP 7 -L 107 F mutant. </p...|$|R
40|$|Surface Flow Types (SFTs), {{distinctive}} {{patterns of}} disturbance {{on the surface}} of flowing water resulting from the interaction between flow and channel shape, were used to delimit meso-scale in-channel habitats in eight British lowland rivers to determine whether SFT mesohabitats were capable of being mapped, and were physically and biologically distinct. Five different SFTs - No Perceptible (NP), Smooth (SM), Rippled (RP), Unbroken wave (UW) and Upwelling (UP) - were investigated, a further three rare types (Chute, Broken wave and Confused) were mapped but not investigated further. Identification and mapping the extent of SFTs of was shown to be practical by estimating SFT mesohabitat extent onto large scale plans of the stream channel supported by differential Global Positioning Satellite technology. Mesohabitats were drawn as they existed, giving a large degree of variability in relation to channel shape and improving over several current rapid habitat mapping methods. The physical distinctiveness of five SFT mesohabitats was examined using data collected from 596 mesohabitats over a wide range of discharges. Mean column velocity and substrate grain size (dominant and sub-dominant) increased from NP, through SM and RP to UW. Velocity, substrate size and embeddedness of fine particles were significantly different (ANOVA and Pair-wise) between the five SFTs investigated. Substrate size was positively associated with increasing velocity, depth and embeddedness were negatively associated with velocity. PCA showed that <b>substrate</b> <b>opposes</b> embeddedness and velocity opposes depth. The degree of distinctiveness was diminished by data ranges which encompassed several SFTs. Macroinvertebrates were collected in 375 samples from 139 SFTs, using one-minute kick samples and identified to Biological Monitoring Working Party family level. ANOVA and Pair-wise analysis of Lotic-invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation Velocity Group shows significant differences between 80 % of SFT combinations with UP least distinct. Mean relative abundance and taxonomic richness increased from NP, through SM and RP to UW and were positively related to velocity. ANOVA showed significant differences between relative abundance and richness in SFTs, whilst Pair-wise analysis shows that adjacent SFTs, in relation to velocity, were less different than those further away. Thus NP is similar to SM and different to UW. Diversity and Equitability The Relationship of Benthic Macroinvertebrate Assemblages to Water Surface Flow Types in British Lowland Rivers iv between SFTs were less distinct. Thirteen macroinvertebrate family groups were significantly associated (X 2 Test) with particular Surface Flow Types, e. g. Ancylidae with UW; Chironomidae with NP. Biological distinctiveness was not established, although general trends were identified One mesohabitat – UP - is rare, being physically related to NP and SM in depth and substrate, and to SM and RP in velocity and embeddedness. It is biologically less distinct than the other four SFTs. The research shows that the extents of NP, SM, RP and UW mesohabitats in British lowland rivers are capable of being mapped. There are significant trends in their physical distinctiveness which are linked to increasing downstream velocity although is not strong.
