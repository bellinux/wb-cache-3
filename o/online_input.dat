DARCL suits the needs of MTN and can also serve as a powerful general-purpose policy language for authorization. To orchestrate the negotiation process among multiple parties without a centralized moderator, we propose the diffusion negotiation protocol, a set of message-passing conventions that allows parties to carry out a negotiation in a distributed fashion. Building on top of the diffusion negotiation protocol, we propose two negotiation strategies to drive MTN with different tradeoffs between privacy and negotiation speed.

40|$|The network {{topology}} of neurons {{in the brain}} exhibits an abundance of feedback connections, but the computational function of these feedback connections is largely unknown. We present a computational theory that characterizes the gain in computational power achieved through feedback in dynamical systems with fading memory. It implies that many such systems acquire through feedback universal computational capabilities for analog computing with a non-fading memory. In particular, we show that feedback enables such systems to process time-varying input streams in diverse ways according to rules that are implemented through internal states of the dynamical system. In contrast to previous attractor-based computational models for neural networks, these flexible internal states are high-dimensional attractors of the circuit dynamics, that still allow the circuit state to absorb new information from <b>online</b> <b>input</b> streams. In this way one arrives at novel models for working memory, integration of evidence, and reward expectation in cortical circuits.
