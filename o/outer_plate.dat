500|$|The design {{weakness}} of super-dreadnoughts, which distinguished them from post-World War I designs, was armour disposition. Their design emphasized the vertical armour protection needed in short-range battles, where shells would strike {{the sides of}} the ship, and assumed that an <b>outer</b> <b>plate</b> of armour would detonate any incoming shells so that crucial internal structures such as turret bases needed only light protection against splinters. [...] This was {{in spite of the fact}} that these ships could engage the enemy at , ranges where the shells would be descending at angles of up to thirty degrees ('plunging fire') and so could drop behind the <b>outer</b> <b>plate</b> and strike the internal structures directly. Post-war designs typically had 5 to 6inches (130 to 150mm) of deck armour laid across the top of single, much thicker vertical plates to defend against this. The concept of zone of immunity became a major part of the thinking behind battleship design. Lack of underwater protection was also a {{weakness of}} these pre-World War I designs which were developed before the use of torpedoes became widespread.|$|E

500|$|The {{underwater}} {{protection system}} {{was designed to}} withstand a direct hit from a [...] explosive warhead; British aerial torpedoes had smaller warheads than this, though their ship-launched weapons were more powerful. The navy conducted several full-scale underwater explosion tests with sections of armour cut from the old pre-dreadnought [...] The tests revealed that welded steel construction better withstood {{the impact of the}} 250kg warhead than did riveted steel plates. However, the torpedo bulkhead, composed of Wotan Weich (Wotan, soft) steel, placed behind the armoured belt was riveted; this was done because plate joints that had been incorrectly welded would not sufficiently withstand explosive shocks. The underwater protection system was constructed out of several layers: the outer layer that was between 12–66mm (.47–2.6in) thick, directly underneath the main armoured belt, was designed to detonate the torpedo warhead. Behind the <b>outer</b> <b>plate</b> was a large void which would allow gases from the explosion to expand and dissipate. Beyond this was a fuel bunker with an [...] thick outer wall; this would absorb any remaining explosive force. The bunker was supported by longitudinal stiffeners and transverse bulkheads.|$|E

I have {{recently}} put into an experimental form that general {{statement of the}} question of specific inductive capacity which is given at No. 1252 of Series XI., and the result is such as to lead me to hope the Council of the Royal Society will authorize its addition to the paper {{in the form of a}} supplementary note. Three circular brass plates, about five inches in diameter, were mounted side by side upon insulating pillars; the middle one, A, was a fixture, but the outer plates B and C were moveable on slides, so that all three could be brought with their sides almost into contact, or separated to any required distance. Two gold leaves were suspended in a glass jar from insulated wires; one of the outer plates B was connected with one of the gold leaves, and the other <b>outer</b> <b>plate</b> with the other leaf. The outer plates B and C were adjusted at the distance of an inch and a quarter from the middle plate A, and the gold leaves were fixed at two inches apart; A was then slightly charged with electricity, and the plates B and C, with their gold leaves, thrown out of insulation at the same time, and then left insulated. In this state of things A was charged positive inductrically, and B and C negative inducteously; the same dielectric, air, being in the two intervals, and the gold leaves hanging, of course, parallel to each other in a relatively unelectrified state.|$|E

50|$|The {{roller chain}} design reduces {{friction}} compared to simpler designs, resulting in higher efficiency and less wear. The original power transmission chain varieties lacked rollers and bushings, {{with both the}} inner and <b>outer</b> <b>plates</b> held by pins which directly contacted the sprocket teeth; however this configuration exhibited extremely rapid wear of both the sprocket teeth, and the plates where they pivoted on the pins. This problem was partially solved {{by the development of}} bushed chains, with the pins holding the <b>outer</b> <b>plates</b> passing through bushings or sleeves connecting the inner plates. This distributed the wear over a greater area; however the teeth of the sprockets still wore more rapidly than is desirable, from the sliding friction against the bushings. The addition of rollers surrounding the bushing sleeves of the chain and provided rolling contact with the teeth of the sprockets resulting in excellent resistance to wear of both sprockets and chain as well. There is even very low friction, as long as the chain is sufficiently lubricated. Continuous, clean, lubrication of roller chains is of primary importance for efficient operation as well as correct tensioning.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{form of the}} device was just a glass bottle partially filled with water, with a metal wire passing through a cork closing it. The role of the <b>outer</b> <b>plate</b> {{was provided by the}} hand of the experimenter. Soon it was found that it was better to coat the exterior of the jar with metal foil (Watson, 1746), leaving the (accidentally) impure water inside acting as a conductor, connected by a chain or wire to an external terminal, a sphere to avoid losses by corona discharge. Later the water inside was replaced with a second metal foil lining. Early experimenters found that the thinner the dielectric, the closer the plates, and the greater the surface, the greater the charge that could be stored at a given voltage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{was of the}} Christie type, {{with long}} helical springs (in tension) angled back to keep the hull sides low. Of the five road wheels each side, four had shock absorbers. The tracks were driven by sprocketed wheels at the rear and tension adjusted at the front idler, this being standard British practice. Some variants were produced with 14 in tracks; later, 15.5-inch tracks were used. As with previous Christie-suspension cruiser tanks, there were no track return rollers, the track being supported instead {{on the tops of}} the road wheels, known as the [...] "slack-track" [...] design. The side of the hull was made up of two spaced plates, the suspension units between them, and the <b>outer</b> <b>plate</b> having cutouts for the movement of the road-wheel axles.|$|E
