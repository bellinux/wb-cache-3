5|$|Although {{other firms}} {{expressed}} interest to Kates and Rogers Majestic {{in using the}} tubes, issues with acquiring patents prevented him, Rogers Majestic, or the University of Toronto from patenting the tubes anywhere outside Canada until 1955, and the patent application was not accepted in the United States until March 1957, six years after filing. By then, research and use of vacuum tubes was heavily waning in the face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of the superior transistor, preventing any re-visitation of Bertie or similar machines.

5|$|In 1823, the Anti-Slavery Society {{was founded}} in Britain, {{dedicated}} to abolishing slavery throughout the British Empire; the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 represented the achievement of their goal.

5|$|Senator Henry Wilson, {{founder of}} the unit, was well known during the war for his antislavery {{political}} stance.

In 1872, the same year he was elected Vice-President under Ulysses Grant, Wilson published the first volume of his History <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rise</b> and Fall of the Slave Power, a severe criticism of slave owners and their primary role, according to Wilson, in bringing about the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|There are {{different}} accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of Darius {{to the throne}} from both Darius himself and Greek historians. The oldest records report a convoluted sequence of events in which Cambyses II lost his mind, murdered his brother Bardiya, and was killed by an infected leg wound. After this, Darius {{and a group of}} six nobles traveled to Sikayauvati to kill an usurper, Gaumata, who had taken the throne by pretending to be Bardiya during the true king's absence. Many modern historians believe that Gaumata, in fact, was the true heir Bardiya, with the historical account being altered by Darius to make the coup d'etat appear more legitimate.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper has}} {{established}} an evolutionary game model, and has examined <b>the</b> promotional effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> oil price on companies’ behaviour of {{carbon emission reduction}}. The research results show that, <b>the</b> promotional impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> oil price on companies’ carbon reduction behaviour is uncertain. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> oil price, <b>the</b> evolutionary result <b>of</b> companies’ carbon emission reduction behaviour will depend on <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> oil price, <b>the</b> initial status <b>of</b> companies, <b>the</b> saved cost and the revenues from emission permits. At the same time, <b>the</b> percentage <b>of</b> companies who reduce carbon emission at the initial evolutionary period will also influence <b>the</b> evolution direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole group. This paper has showed the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> oil price and companies’ carbon reduction behaviour, and it will provide theoretical reference for promulgating rational low carbon policies...|$|R

5|$|In 1195 Walter {{issued an}} {{ordinance}} by which four knights were appointed in every hundred {{to act as}} guardians of the peace, a precursor {{to the office of}} Justice of the Peace. His use of the knights, who appear {{for the first time in}} political life, is the first sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of this class who, either as members of parliament or justices of the peace, later became the mainstay of English government. In 1198, Walter requested a carucage, or plough-tax, of five shillings on every plough-land, or carucate, under cultivation. However, difficulties arose over the assessments, so the justiciar ordered them to be made by a sworn jury in every hundred. It is likely that those jurors were elected.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of the Pectinidae family, the Antarctic scallop is a {{suspension}} feeder, extracting its nourishment from the sea water that surrounds it. Bands of cilia on the velum, a curtain-like fold of the mantle, waft particles towards the gills. Oxygen is absorbed by the gills and food particles, mostly microscopic algae, are trapped in mucous and transported to the mouth by cilia. There is a seasonal increase in microscopic ice algae which become available to suspension feeders when the sea ice melts in the summer, and most of the annual growth takes place at this time. Research has shown that this is as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> in sea temperature and not the greater availability of food.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} slaves in Indiana were {{owned by the}} French traders who entered the region and introduced the practice to the native tribes. Jesuit priests encouraged the tribes they lived among to adopt slavery {{as an alternative to}} executing their prisoners in war. According to some classical historians, the decline of cannibalism among the tribes was a direct result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of slavery. Early slaves were often Native Americans who were sold to pay debts. The early slaves typically performed manual labor, helping the traders transport their goods and to build forts and trading posts. While part of new France, laws were enacted to give slaves some protection from their masters. Torture and mutilation of slaves was forbidden, and families were prevented from being forcibly broken up. Other laws allowed slaves to be seized by creditors as payment. Other laws required that if a master had children by a slave, the slave and her children were then to be freed. Their status under the French laws was similar to that of minors.|$|E

5|$|The {{political}} history of medieval Karnataka spans the 4th to the 16th centuries, when the empires that {{evolved in the}} Karnataka region of India made a lasting impact on the subcontinent. Before this, alien empires held sway over the region, and the nucleus of power was outside modern Karnataka. The medieval era can be broadly divided into several periods: The earliest native kingdoms and imperialism; the successful domination of the Gangetic plains in northern India and rivalry with the empires of Tamilakam over the Vengi region; and the domination of the southern Deccan and consolidation against Muslim invasion. The origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of the Karnataka region as an independent power {{date back to the}} fourth-century birth of the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi, the earliest of the native rulers to conduct administration in the native language of Kannada in addition to the official Sanskrit. This is the historical starting point in studying the development of the region as an enduring geopolitical entity and of Kannada as an important regional language.|$|E
