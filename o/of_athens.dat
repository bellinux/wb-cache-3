5|$|Greek epigrams {{contribute}} {{their share}} in Pliny's descriptions of pictures and statues. One {{of the minor}} authorities for books XXXIV–XXXV is Heliodorus <b>of</b> <b>Athens,</b> {{the author of a}} work on the monuments <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b> In the indices to XXXIII–XXXVI, an important place is assigned to Pasiteles of Naples, the author of a work in five volumes on famous works of art (XXXVI:40), probably incorporating the substance of the earlier Greek treatises; but Pliny's indebtedness to Pasiteles is denied by Kalkmann, who holds that Pliny used the chronological work of Apollodorus <b>of</b> <b>Athens,</b> as well as a current catalogue of artists. Pliny's knowledge of the Greek authorities was probably mainly due to Varro, whom he often quotes (e.g. XXXIV:56, XXXV:173, 156, XXXVI:17, 39, 41).|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of his doctorate, Tsakalotos entered into an academic career. His first role was as a {{research associate at the}} University of Kent, from 1989 to 1990. From October 1990 to June 1993, he taught at the university as a lecturer. In 1993, Tsakalotos and his wife moved to Greece, and in October 1994 he began teaching at the Athens University of Economics and Business. In September 2010, he became a full professor of economics at the National and Kapodistrian University <b>of</b> <b>Athens,</b> more commonly referred to simply as the University <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b>|$|E
5|$|As no {{description}} of the frieze survives from antiquity and many religious rituals involved secret symbolism and traditions left unspoken, so {{the question of the}} meaning of the sculpture has been a persistent and unresolved one. The first published attempt at interpretation belongs to Cyriac of Ancona in the fifteenth century AD who referred to it as the “victories <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> in the time of Pericles”. What is now the more accepted view of the piece, however, namely that it depicts the Greater Panathenaic procession from the Leokoreion by the Dipylon gate, to the Acropolis, was mooted by Stuart and Revett in the second volume of their Antiquities <b>of</b> <b>Athens,</b> 1787. Subsequent interpretations have built largely on this theory, even if they disallow that a temple sculpture could represent a contemporary event rather than a mythological or historical one. It has only been in recent years that an alternative thesis in which the frieze depicts the founding myth of the city <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> instead of the festival pompe has emerged.|$|E
5|$|Ephialtes' {{murder in}} 461 BC {{paved the way}} for Pericles to {{consolidate}} his authority. Without opposition after the expulsion of Cimon, the unchallengeable leader of the democratic party became the unchallengeable ruler <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b> He remained in power until his death in 429BC.|$|E
5|$|Following Thermopylae, the Persian army {{burned and}} sacked the Boeotian cities {{that had not}} {{submitted}} to them—Plataea and Thespiae—and then marched on the now evacuated city <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following their conquest in 1211–1212, {{the cities}} were granted as a fief to Otto de la Roche, Duke <b>of</b> <b>Athens,</b> by Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea. The lordship {{remained}} {{in the possession of}} the de la Roche and the Brienne Dukes <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> even after the conquest of the Duchy <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> by the Catalan Company in 1311, and the Brienne line continued to be recognized as Dukes <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> there. Walter II of Brienne was largely an absentee lord, spending most of his life in his European domains, except for a failed attempt in 1331 to recover Athens from the Catalans. After his death in 1356 the lordship was inherited by his sixth son, Guy of Enghien. Guy took up residence in Greece, and in 1370–1371 Guy and his brothers launched another, also failed, invasion of the Catalan domains. When Guy died in 1376, the lordship then passed to his daughter Maria of Enghien and her Venetian husband Pietro Cornaro, who would also reside there until his death in 1388. The lordship became a de facto Venetian dependency during this period, and shortly after his death, Marie sold the two cities to Venice, where she retired. Before Venice could take possession, Argos was seized by the Despot Theodore I Palaiologos, while his ally, Nerio I Acciaioli seized Nauplia. The latter city was soon captured by Venice, but Argos remained in Byzantine hands until 1394, when it too was handed over to Venice.|$|E

5|$|In Greek mythology, Auriga {{is often}} {{identified}} as the mythological Greek hero Erichthonius <b>of</b> <b>Athens,</b> the chthonic son of Hephaestus who was raised by the goddess Athena. Erichthonius was generally credited to be {{the inventor of the}} quadriga, the four-horse chariot, which he used in the battle against the usurper Amphictyon, the event that made Erichthonius the king <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b> His chariot was created {{in the image of the}} Sun's chariot, the reason Zeus placed him in the heavens. The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and, soon after, Zeus raised him into the night sky in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.|$|E
5|$|In Oedipus at Colonus, the banished Oedipus and his {{daughter}} Antigone arrive at the town of Colonus where they encounter Theseus, King <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b> Oedipus dies and strife begins between his sons Polyneices and Eteocles.|$|E

5|$|According to Diodorus, Philip {{marched on}} his enemies in this {{alliance}} {{before they had}} chance to combine, and forced them to ally to Macedon instead. However, other sources suggest that the picture was actually much more complex, and that Philip in turn defeated each of the powers {{over the next few}} years, with the exception <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{the story}} of the Tree That Owns Itself is more legend than history, the tree has become (along with the University Arch and the Double-Barreled Cannon) one of the most {{recognized}} and well-loved symbols <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b> It is routinely featured in travel guides and other visitor information, and has even garnered international recognition through such publications as Ripley's Believe It Or Not, where it has been featured on several occasions.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this turmoil, {{specific}} regions in mainland Greece witnessed a dramatic population decrease, especially Boeotia, Argolis and Messenia. Mycenaean refugees migrated to Cyprus and the Levantine coast. Nevertheless, other regions {{on the edge of the}} Mycenaean world prospered, such as the Ionian islands, the northwestern Peloponnese, parts of Attica and a number of Aegean islands. The acropolis <b>of</b> <b>Athens,</b> oddly, appears to have avoided destruction.|$|E
5|$|Aspasia, who {{was noted}} for her {{ability as a}} conversationalist and adviser, was accused of corrupting the women <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> {{in order to satisfy}} Pericles' perversions. The accusations against her were {{probably}} nothing more than unproven slanders, but the whole experience was very bitter for Pericles. Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles, his friend, Phidias, died in prison and another friend of his, Anaxagoras, was attacked by the ecclesia for his religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Athens {{was chosen}} as the Greek capital for {{historical}} and sentimental reasons, not because it was a large city. At the time, it was a town consisting of only 400 houses {{at the foot of the}} Acropolis. A modern city plan was laid out, and public buildings erected. The finest legacy of this period are the buildings of the University <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> (1837, under the name Othonian University), the Athens Polytechnic University (1837, under the name Royal School of Arts), the National Gardens <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> (1840), the National Library of Greece (1842), the Old Royal Palace (now the Greek Parliament Building, 1843), and the Old Parliament Building (1858). Schools and hospitals were established all over the (still small) Greek dominion, Due to the negative feelings of the Greek people toward non-Greek rule, historical attention to this aspect of his reign has been neglected.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Princess Andrew {{was in the}} {{difficult}} situation of having sons-in-law fighting on the German side and a son in the British Royal Navy. Her cousin, Prince Victor zu Erbach-Schönberg, was the German ambassador in Greece until the occupation <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> by Axis forces in April 1941. She and her sister-in-law, Princess Nicholas of Greece (the mother of Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent), lived in Athens {{for the duration of}} the war, while most of the Greek royal family remained in exile in South Africa. She moved out of her small flat and into her brother-in-law George's three-storey house in the centre <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b> She worked for the Red Cross, helped organize soup kitchens for the starving populace and flew to Sweden to bring back medical supplies on the pretext of visiting her sister, Louise, who was married to the Crown Prince. She organized two shelters for orphaned and stray children, and a nursing circuit for poor neighbourhoods.|$|E
5|$|For the Persians, {{the only}} {{unfinished}} business that remained {{by the end}} of 493 BC was to exact punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt. The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> and Eretria.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the invasion, the Athenians began rebuilding their city under the guidance of Themistocles. They wished to restore the fortifications <b>of</b> <b>Athens,</b> but the Spartans objected on the grounds that no place north of the Isthmus should be left that the Persians could use as a fortress. Themistocles urged the citizens to build the fortifications as quickly as possible, then went to Sparta as an ambassador to answer the charges levelled by the Spartans. There, he assured them that no building work was on-going, and urged them to send emissaries to Athens to see for themselves. By the time the ambassadors arrived, the Athenians had finished building, and then detained the Spartan ambassadors when they complained about the presence of the fortifications. By delaying in this manner, Themistocles gave the Athenians enough time to fortify the city, and thus ward off any Spartan attack aimed at preventing the re-fortification <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b> Furthermore, the Spartans were obliged to repatriate Themistocles in order to free their own ambassadors. However, this episode may be seen as the beginning of the Spartan mistrust of Themistocles, which would return to haunt him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 472 BC, Pericles {{presented}} The Persians of Aeschylus at the Greater Dionysia as a liturgy, demonstrating {{that he was one}} of the wealthier men <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b> Simon Hornblower has argued that Pericles' selection of this play, which presents a nostalgic picture of Themistocles' famous victory at Salamis, shows that the young politician was supporting Themistocles against his political opponent Cimon, whose faction succeeded in having Themistocles ostracized shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{month after}} Alexander Onassis's death, McCusker had {{manslaughter}} proceedings initiated against him by the public prosecutor <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> in connection with the crash. Six people were also charged over Onassis's death in January 1974, with their indictment indicating that faulty controls had been fitted to his plane.|$|E
5|$|Miran Pastourma is a famed pastourma and sujuk charcuterie {{business}} and market in Athens, Greece. The {{market has been}} in operation since 1922. It is considered the charcuterie of the connoisseurs. Despite the Greek economic crisis, Miran is expanding its {{business and}} has doubled in size to accommodate increased demand. The founder of the shop, Miran Kourounlian, {{is thought to be}} the man who brought pastourma to Athens for the first time. Miran is considered the largest company {{of its kind in the}} European Union. The flavour of pastourma coming from the historical enterprise permeates Euripides Street in the centre <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b> Miran and its neighbor Arapian Cold Cuts are considered two of the historical establishments <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b> Miran has been in the same spot in Euripidou Street since its opening in 1922. Miran is the recipient of multiple gourmet prizes.|$|E
5|$|On , Britain and France officially {{recognized}} Venizelos {{government as}} the only lawful government of Greece, effectively splitting the country. On , Venizelos' government officially declared war on the Central Powers. A royal warrant for the arrest of Venizelos was immediately issued and the Archbishop <b>of</b> <b>Athens,</b> pressured by the royal house, anathematised the prime minister.|$|E
5|$|Otto's early reign {{was also}} notable for his moving {{the capital of}} Greece from Nafplion to Athens. His first task as king {{was to make a}} {{detailed}} archaeological and topographic survey <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b> He assigned Gustav Eduard Schaubert and Stamatios Kleanthis to complete this task. At that time, Athens had a population of roughly 4,000–5,000 people, located mainly in what today covers the district of Plaka in Athens.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Halmyros, {{known by}} older {{scholars}} as the Battle of the Cephissus or Battle of Orchomenos, was fought on 15 March 1311 between {{the forces of}} the Frankish Duchy <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> and its vassals under Walter of Brienne and the mercenaries of the Catalan Company, resulting in a devastating victory for the Catalans.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Marathon (Greek: , Machē tou Marathōnos) {{took place}} in 490 BC, during the first Persian {{invasion}} of Greece. It was fought between the citizens <b>of</b> <b>Athens,</b> aided by Plataea, and a Persian force commanded by Datis and Artaphernes. The battle {{was the culmination of}} the first attempt by Persia, under King Darius I, to subjugate Greece. The Greek army decisively defeated the more numerous Persians, marking {{a turning point in the}} Greco-Persian Wars.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Eurymedon was {{a double}} battle, taking place both on water and land, between the Delian League <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> and her Allies, and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I. It {{took place in}} either 469 or 466 BC, in the {{vicinity}} of the mouth of the Eurymedon River (now the Köprüçay) in Pamphylia, Asia Minor. It forms part of the Wars of the Delian League, itself part of the larger Greco-Persian Wars.|$|E
5|$|The Greek states <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> and Eretria allowed {{themselves}} {{to be drawn into}} this conflict by Aristagoras, and during their only campaigning season (498 BC) they contributed to the capture and burning of the Persian regional capital of Sardis. After this, the Ionian Revolt carried on (without further outside aid) for a further 5 years, until it was finally completely crushed by the Persians. However, in a decision of great historic significance, the Persian king Darius the Great decided that, despite successfully subduing the revolt, there remained the unfinished business of exacting punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt. The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> and Eretria.|$|E
5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} slavery in ancient Greece is beset by significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing primarily on the city-state <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b> No treatises are specifically devoted to the subject, and jurisprudence was interested in slavery only inasmuch as it provided a source of revenue. Greek comedies and tragedies represented stereotypes, while iconography made no substantial differentiation between slaves and craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of defensive structures was {{closely linked to}} the establishment of the palaces in mainland Greece. The principal Mycenaean centers were well-fortified and usually situated on an elevated terrain, like on the acropolis <b>of</b> <b>Athens,</b> Tiryns and Mycenae or on coastal plains, in the case of Gla. Mycenaean Greeks in general appreciated the symbolism of war as expressed in defensive architecture, reflected by the visual impressiveness of their fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Themistocles {{probably}} turned 30 in 494BC, which qualified him {{to become}} an archon, the highest of the magistracies in Athens. On {{the back of his}} popularity, he evidently decided to run for this office and was elected Archon Eponymous, the highest government office in the following year (493BC). Themistocles's archonship saw the beginnings of a major theme in his career; the advancement of Athenian sea-power. Under his guidance, the Athenians began the building of a new port at Piraeus, to replace the existing facilities at Phalerum. Although further away from Athens, Piraeus offered three natural harbours, and could be easily fortified. Since Athens was to become an essentially maritime power during the 5th centuryBC, Themistocles's policies were to have huge significance for the future <b>of</b> <b>Athens,</b> and indeed Greece. In advancing naval power, Themistocles was probably advocating a course of action he thought essential for the long-term prospects <b>of</b> <b>Athens.</b> However, as Plutarch implies, since naval power relied on the mass mobilisation of the common citizens (thetes) as rowers, such a policy put more power into the hands of average Atheniansand thus into Themistocles's own hands.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the {{conflict}} with Persia, the process by which the Delian League became the Athenian Empire reached its conclusion. The allies <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> were not released from their obligations to provide either money or ships, despite the cessation of hostilities. In Greece, the First Peloponnesian War between the power-blocs <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> and Sparta, which had continued on/off since 460 BC, finally ended in 445 BC, with the agreement of a thirty-year truce. However, the growing enmity between Sparta and Athens would lead, just 14 years later, into the outbreak of the Second Peloponnesian War. This disastrous conflict, which dragged on for 27 years, would eventually result in the utter destruction of Athenian power, the dismemberment of the Athenian empire, and the establishment of a Spartan hegemony over Greece. However, not just Athens suffered—{{the conflict}} would significantly weaken the whole of Greece.|$|E
5|$|When Mardonius {{learned of}} the Spartan force, he {{completed}} the destruction <b>of</b> <b>Athens,</b> tearing down whatever was left standing. He then retreated towards Thebes, hoping to lure the Greek army into territory that would be suitable for the Persian cavalry. Mardonius created a fortified encampment on the north bank of the Asopus river in Boeotia covering the ground from Erythrae past Hysiae {{and up to the}} lands of Plataea.|$|E
5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual {{strategy was}} adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
5|$|According to some later accounts, {{before the}} {{eruption}} of the Peloponnesian War (431 BC404 BC), Pericles, some of his closest associates (including the philosopher Anaxagoras and sculptor Phidias) and Aspasia faced a series of personal and legal attacks. Aspasia, in particular, was reportedly accused of corrupting the women <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> {{in order to satisfy}} Pericles' perversions. According to Plutarch, she was put on trial for impiety, with the comic poet Hermippus as prosecutor. The historical nature of the accounts about these events is disputed, and apparently no harm came to her as a result.|$|E
5|$|According to the Suda, the Catalogue {{was five}} books long. The length of each is unknown, {{but it is}} likely that the entire poem {{consisted}} of anywhere from 4000 to over 5000 lines. The majority of the content was structured around major genealogical units: the descendants of Aeolus were found in book 1 and at least part of book 2, followed by those of Inachus, Pelasgus, Atlas and Pelops in the later books. It is believed that a rough guide to this structure can be found in the Bibliotheca, a Roman-era mythological handbook transmitted under the name of Apollodorus <b>of</b> <b>Athens</b> which used the Catalogue as a primary source for many genealogical details and appears to have followed reflect the poem's overall arrangement.|$|E
