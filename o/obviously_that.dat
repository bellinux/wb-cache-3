500|$|Finkelstein noted 20 instances, {{in as many}} pages, where Dershowitz's book {{cites the}} same sources and {{passages}} used by Joan Peters in her book, in largely the same sequence, with ellipses in the same places. In two instances, Dershowitz reproduces Peters's errors (see below). From this Finkelstein concluded that Dershowitz had not checked the original sources himself, contrary to the latter's claims. Finkelstein suggests that this copying of quotations amounts to copying ideas. Examining {{a copy of a}} proof of Dershowitz's book he managed to obtain, he found evidence that Dershowitz had his secretarial assistant, Holly Beth Billington, check in the Harvard library the sources he had read in Peters's book. Dershowitz answered the charge {{in a letter to the}} University of California's Press Director Lynne Withey, arguing that Finkelstein had made up the smoking gun quotation, in that he had changed its wording (from 'cite' to 'copy') in his book. In public debate he has stated that if [...] "somebody borrowed the quote without going to check back on whether Mark Twain had said that, <b>obviously</b> <b>that</b> would be a serious charge"; however, he insisted emphatically that he himself did not do that, that he had indeed checked the original source by Twain.|$|E
500|$|When an {{interviewer}} {{asked him to}} describe himself as a child, he replied that he was [...] "probably well-meaning and naive like all kids." [...] His passion for sea life {{can be traced to}} his childhood, when several films by French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau made a strong impression on him. He has said that Cousteau [...] "provided a view into that world", which he did not know existed. He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that [...] "should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad." [...] Also at a young age, Hillenburg developed his interest in art. His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration that he drew in third grade depicting [...] "a bunch of army men... kissing and hugging instead of fighting" [...] marked the first praise that he received for his work after his teacher commended it. [...] "Of course, this is 1970... She liked it because, I mean, <b>obviously</b> <b>that</b> {{was in the middle of}} [...] She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...I had no idea about the implications, really, because I just thought it was a funny idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that,'" [...] Hillenburg elaborated. It was then when he knew that he [...] "had some [...] skill". Hillenburg asserted that his artistry comes from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was [...] "really, really gifted" [...] and a [...] "great painter". In the 1970s, someone took him to the International Tournée of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Hillenburg was [...] "knocked out" [...] by the foreign animated films that were screened at the festival, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). [...] "That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on," [...] he recounted.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{operating}} system and its portable components are used in commercial products, de Raadt says that little of the funding for the project comes from the industry: [...] "traditionally all our funding has come from user donations and users buying our CDs (our other products don't really make us much money). <b>Obviously,</b> <b>that</b> {{has not been a}} lot of money." ...|$|E

5000|$|The former {{majority}} Conservative government {{supported the}} prohibition of prostitution. Responding to the 2006 report, Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated [...] "In terms of legalization of prostitution I can just tell you <b>that</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>that's</b> something that this government doesn't favour". Justice Minister Rob Nicholson also stated: [...] "We {{are not in the}} business of legalizing brothels, and we have no intention of changing any of the laws relating to prostitution in this country.” ...|$|R

2500|$|Initially {{after the}} game ASU coach Todd Graham stated [...] "The quarterback put {{the ball on the}} ground while he was still {{standing}} up, he hadn't been tackled," [...] and [...] "So that should have been a turnover. That should have ended the game." [...] And after watching the footage {{after the game}} he acknowledged the officiating error when he stated [...] "You win or you lose. We won and let's move onto the next deal. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>that</b> was a very unusual deal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bjelland {{was married}} and {{divorced}} twice and had a son, Henry (born 1999), with her second husband. In 2007 Bjelland had a schizophrenic episode and had received treatment. Bjelland commented on the event, saying: “I don’t know how I’ve progressed musically as such but a major influence in my writing was dealing with my whole schizophrenia episode. I actually haven’t spoken to anyone much about this. Dealing with multiple personalities was extremely difficult because some days I didn't know who I was or where I was at. I was very lucky that Adrian stuck by and helped me through it all. So <b>obviously</b> <b>that</b> was going to affect some of what I wrote about." [...] She was later told she has a schizoaffective disorder.|$|E
2500|$|Jessie J {{has been}} criticized by people who find the lyrics of the song hypocritical: a [...] "rich rock star" [...] telling {{the rest of us}} that money doesn't matter, or {{questioning}} why she then charges for her music. She has repeatedly explained in interviews that this is a misreading of her meaning, which skewers the superficiality of conspicuous consumption -- or more simply, that [...] "show-offs suck." [...] "For me, so much I hear about how much money people have and how people just take stuff too seriously. It’s not me saying that you can live for free, because <b>obviously</b> <b>that</b> isn’t the case; but I’m saying that you don’t always have to let it be about that. It isn’t always about how much your shoes cost. It’s {{about the fact that you}} even have a pair of shoes to walk in." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the newly increased demand for reading matter in the Augustan period, Grub Street became a popular source of periodical literature. [...] One publication {{to take advantage of}} the reduction of state control was A Perfect Diurnall (despite its title, a weekly publication). [...] However it quickly found its name copied by unscrupulous Grub Street publishers, so <b>obviously</b> <b>that</b> the newspaper was forced to issue a warning to its readers. [...] Toward the end of the 17th century authors such as John Dunton worked on a range of periodicals, including Pegasus (1696), and The Night Walker: or, Evening Rambles in search after lewd Women (16961697). [...] Dunton pioneered the advice column in Athenian Mercury (16901697). [...] The satirical writer and publican Ned Ward published The London Spy (16981700) in monthly instalments, for over a year and a half. [...] It was conceived as a guide to the sights of the city, but as a periodical also contained details on taverns, coffee-houses, tobacco shops, and bagnios.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2014, Corbyn {{questioned}} subjective [...] "legal obstacles" [...] put {{in place}} for UK fighters returning from the Syrian Civil War, including those who had fought for ISIS and the Syrian Government {{as well as the}} Free Syrian Army, arguing that [...] "There {{are an awful lot of}} contradictions surrounding how we decide who is a good fighter and who is a terrorist; who is struggling for liberation and who is a terrorist." [...] Corbyn said [...] "I have no support for ISIS whatsoever, and <b>obviously</b> <b>that</b> should apply to someone who has committed crimes, but we should bear in mind that expressing a political point of view is not in itself an offence". He called on the Government to think about this rather more carefully and avoid the knee-jerk reaction of saying, [...] "These are bad fighters and those are good fighters, so we will ban these and allow those in." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-2004, Utada {{moved back}} to New York, and began work on a new {{recording}} contract with Island Def Jam Music Group. On October 5, 2004, she released her North American English-language debut album, Exodus, under the name [...] "Utada," [...] which was her new American-given artist title at the Universal Convention. It was released nearly a month earlier, on September 9 in Japan, with a special booklet and housed in a cardboard slipcase. In an MTV interview, Utada said: [...] "I don't think it's the music that I'm concerned about. It's <b>obviously</b> <b>that</b> I look really different and there really aren't any completely Asian people [...] right now." [...] Exodus became Utada's fourth consecutive release to debut at number 1 and boast 500,000 copies in its first-week sales in Japan. In spite of enlisting Timbaland to produce and co-write some songs, her American debut as an Island Records artist was met with indifference by the American market, selling 55,000 units. [...] "Easy Breezy" [...] was released as the lead single in early August 2004, peaking at number 9 Billboard Hot Dance/Club Airplay chart, followed up by [...] "Devil Inside" [...] a month and two weeks later. And Utada became {{the cover of the}} Interview magazine June 2005 issue.|$|E

2500|$|Chibnall was {{determined}} {{to ensure that the}} identity of the killer did not leak until the final episode aired. One reason for the secrecy was obviously commercial, for it kept viewers watching. But Chibnall also believed it would enhance the acting. [...] "There was a number of reasons for it, one of which was <b>obviously</b> <b>that</b> a lot of the story was driven from characters in the show not knowing, so it enables those characters to behave truthfully in that situation. And also what I wanted was for every performer to slightly suspect their character, and to really think about that, and to suspect each other. ... So what you get is ambiguity, and what it also means is that any of the performer or performers who are responsible for what happened aren't flagging it or signaling it in any way whatsoever." [...] The producers discussed the need for secrecy at length during pre-production and agreed it was essential. Chibnall also discussed secrecy issues with directors James Strong and Euros Lyn, and they both agreed to its necessity before coming aboard the project. As roles were cast, Chibnall also explained to each actor that the killer's identity would be kept from them until {{near the end of the}} production.|$|E
2500|$|Debnam-Carey thanked Lexa's creators, and said, [...] "It {{has been}} an honour to portray [...] To envelop myself in her skin. To be given the freedom to {{represent}} a moment in our cultural and social zeitgeist—she has left a great imprint on me. I will miss her. May we meet again." [...] While at Paleyfest 2016 promoting Fear the Walking Dead, she addressed Lexa's death publicly for the first time. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, {{she said she was}} [...] "surprised by the intensity and the fury" [...] that came from fans and she did not think [...] "anyone on the show expected such social outcry." [...] To Debnam-Carey, [...] "any attention we can draw to a movement like that is an amazing thing, and is a great thing to pursue and keep working towards." [...] She emphasized Lexa's death never came from a place of hate or negativity from the writers or Rothenberg, or anyone in the crew, and the death was purely a creative decision made due to her obligations to Fear the Walking Dead. [...] "I know <b>obviously</b> <b>that</b> it's hard when there are social issues going on and maybe they were dealt with in an insensitive way for some people," [...] stated Debnam-Carey. [...] "And I hate that people feel like that. That's really awful if people feel ostracized or targeted." [...] At her second Q panel weekend at Copenhagen Comic-Con, she said, [...] "It saddens me to think that this was an event that tarnished the show." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sound {{design for}} the film was handled by Martín Hernández, {{who has worked on}} all the director's feature films. The {{production}} sound his team was given was [...] "surprisingly perfect and clean", so they didn't need to spend much time tidying it. The lack of visual cuts in the film meant a departure from the usual way Hernández edited sound though. [...] "Normally Alejandro likes, as he calls it, 'the clashing of the sounds.' The camera changes angle within the scene and there is a change of everything backgrounds, texture, dialog. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>that</b> would not work on Birdman because here, everything is flowing." [...] Additionally, the sound of objects in the film needed to be coordinated with their position onscreen, a non-trivial task since the camera was nearly always moving. Hernández also helped to cut Sánchez's tracks, selecting and editing moments from the New York recordings against the film. When the tracks were re-recording in Los Angeles, in order [...] "to have distance, and closeness and resonance" [...] the team used thirty two microphones for each take. Hernández described the job as [...] "crazy". A large challenge of the post-production soundwork was designing the sound of the theatre audience, particularly in the scene when Mike is drunk and comes out of character. Iñárritu knew how he wanted the audience to respond, but figuring out the sound of their reaction took four months of work from five sound designers. Hernández said he thought, for a film in general, that the narrative created by sound [...] "provokes more 'explosions'" [...] than that created by images, and that in Birdman [...] "Alejandro has sound exploding all throughout the film." ...|$|E
