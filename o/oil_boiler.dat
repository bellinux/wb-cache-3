40|$|Karlshamnsverket is an {{oil fired}} reserve power plant, {{situated}} in the southeast part of Sweden. The power plant consists of three units with a total capacity of 996 MWel and it operates at least 4000 hours in standby annually. The most common standby mode is the 2 hour standby. At 2 hour standby mode the power plant is required to produce electricity to the grid within 2 hours. The order for a start-up is either given by the owners or Svenska Kraftnät. During standby the power plant needs steam to maintain readiness. Steam is supplied to the support steam system, either by an electric heater or by an <b>oil</b> <b>boiler.</b> The support steam system {{is divided into two}} circuits, a non-oil circuit and an oil circuit. Within these two circuits there are a total of ten heat consumers that are active during 2 hour standby. A heat consumer in this thesis is connected to the support steam system and is supplied with steam during 2 hour standby. Such heat consumer may be the deaerator or the heating of the oil tanks. At this time the amount of steam supplied to the heat consumers during 2 hour standby is unknown. The <b>oil</b> <b>boiler</b> of the support steam system has during a normal year 3000 operating hours. This means fuel is consumed when the power plant is not running, thus not generating any profit, only increased costs, for Karlshamnsverket. Therefore there is a strong economic incentive to reduce the running cost of the support steam system. In this thesis the support steam system and its heat consumers are mapped and measured at 2 hour standby to determine their respective heat requirement. The results from the measurements show that a total of 18. 1 MW of steam is required to operate the support steam system at maximum load. The <b>oil</b> <b>boiler</b> of the support steam system has a maximum capacity of 13 MWsteam. The efficiency of the <b>oil</b> <b>boiler</b> is determined to be 85 % via a created model. At this load the <b>oil</b> <b>boiler</b> has approximately 2 MW of flue gas losses. This flue gas loss can be minimized, thus increasing the energy efficiency of the <b>oil</b> <b>boiler.</b> The suggested energy efficiency measure is to install an economiser into the present oil boiler’s flue gas train. To avoid flue gas condensation the economiser is placed after the current Electro Static Precipitator (ESP). The proposed capacity of the economiser is 1. 4 MW and delivers feed water at 80 ºC to the <b>oil</b> <b>boiler.</b> This lowers the fuel consumption with approximately 46 tons of LS HFO per year. The investment cost is approximated to 1. 5 MSEK, resulting in a payback period approximately to 4 – 5 years. The annual savings are determined to be between 300 000 – 340 000 SEK...|$|E

This would mean less use of fuel and lower emissions to the atmosphere. This study has been undertaken as a case study at Skoghall Board Mill, where the possibilities for decreased use of live steam by increased internal heat exchanging have been investigated. As a tool Pinch Technology has been used. This is a tool that makes it easier to see where the system has heat and cooling demand and at which temperatures. Using this as a base, it is then possible to identify where the potential for more internal heat exchange is possible and as a result one can reduce the steam demand. The mill has two power boilers in addition to the recovery boiler, one <b>oil</b> <b>boiler</b> and one bark boiler. The bark boiler is fired with both bark from the mill’s own debarking and purchased bark. The <b>oil</b> <b>boiler</b> has the highest marginal operating costs, thus a reduced steam demand will decrease usage of the <b>oil</b> <b>boiler.</b> By identifying the pinch violations in the system one can identify potential measures for increasing internal heat exchanging. Four alternatives with different degrees of heat recovery have been identified. For these cases the investment costs have been calculated and the technical consequences considered. The calculations were carried out for winter operation. Two cases were considered for potential fuel savings: oil fuel and bark fuel. The results show that the use of live steam can be reduced by 10 to 20 MW. The pay back periods for these investments lie around one year when the saved fuel is oil. For the case with bark the pay back periods are approximately 2. 5 to 4 years...|$|E

The chain is divided in the following phases: grapes pruning harvesting and storage by a round-baler; chipping cylindrical bales to obtain a biochips whose size {{is consistent with the}} biomass boiler; chemical-physical characterization of the biochips; biomass energy conversion in the diathermic <b>oil</b> <b>boiler.</b> Grapes pruning round-baling reached an average productivity of 0, 70 tons/ha dry basis.

40|$|According to the European standard, the CO {{emissions}} of new fuel oil boilers, whose output power {{is lower than}} 400 kW, are limited in steady-state regime to 110 mg/kWh of energy consumption. In order to assess the performance of actual fuel oil boilers, an experimental work has been performed on a boiler available in the laboratory and whose output nominal power is about 370 kW. The two main parameters investigated are the nozzle capacity and the corresponding fuel injection pressure to keep the same burner consumption. Four nozzles whose capacity ranges from 30 to 45 kg/h at 20 bar were fitted on the burner equipping the fuel <b>oil</b> <b>boiler.</b> All the nozzles used are spill return and 45 ° type. To assess the CO {{emissions of}} the fuel <b>oil</b> <b>boiler,</b> tests have been performed in transient and steady-state regimes. The tests were performed so that the output power was kept constant in steady-state regime (same water flow rate and inlet and outlet temperatures). That is why for each nozzle tested, the fuel injection pressure has been adjusted {{in order to maintain}} the fuel mass flow rate at around 37. 7 kg/h. On the other hand, the oxygen content of the flue gas in the chimney was kept constant (around 3 %) by adjusting only the position of the burner air damper (the position of the flame holder was kept constant) and thus the air combustion mass flow rate. Classical gas analysers were used to measure the CO 2, O 2, CO and NOx concentrations in the flue gas. The tests performed showed that in steady-state regime, the CO emissions are very low compared to the European standard. On the other hand, in the transient regime (start-up regime for a cycling boiler), the CO emissions are not negligible and increase significantly if a high capacity nozzle is fitted on the fuel oil burner. In short, the paper demonstrates that in order to increase the boiler thermal efficiency and thus to reduce CO 2 emissions (for the same output power), one has to avoid the CO emissions in the transient regime. When performing a replacement of the burner nozzle, a low capacity nozzle associated with an adjustment of a high fuel injection pressure is recommended, since a reduction of CO emissions in the starting-up regime is achieved and, on the other hand, the thermal efficiency and the pollutants emissions of the fuel <b>oil</b> <b>boiler</b> in steady state regime are not affected...|$|E

The total dwelling space is l 270 square meters. Four of the dwelling-houses are heated from a heat station via a hot-water culvert. In the heat station there are a fuel <b>oil</b> <b>boiler,</b> an air heat pump and an electric water-heater. A fifth house is heated by electricity. The energy consumption has increased considerably at Stjärnhov since the present owner took over the farm in 1982. This depends mostly on the increasing animal stock and the ascending level of mechanization. In order to investigate the energy consumption and the possibilities of energy conservation at Stjärnhov the author has performed studies and made measurements {{during the summer of}} 1989. The investigation shows that the average electricity consumption is 253 000 kWh a year, of which 145 000 kWh is for heating. Installation of a time tariff for electricity has been profitable for the farm. From June 1988 to July 1989 3 460 Swedish crowns were saved. The winter 1988 / 89, however was very mild. A normal winter the saving will be less. The heat losses in the culvert are almost 40 000 kWh a year. By installing electric water-heaters in every house 3 000 Swedish crowns will be saved each year.
