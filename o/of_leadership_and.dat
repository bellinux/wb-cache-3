5|$|Although a professional—captains at {{the time}} were almost {{exclusively}} amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held meant that he was accepted as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. He disliked the responsibility and decision-making <b>of</b> <b>leadership,</b> <b>and</b> rarely even offered tactical advice.|$|E

5|$|A Kansas native, Isenhour {{attended}} the University of Kansas. She began her political {{career as a}} staffer in the Kansas House of Representatives. In 1990 {{she worked as a}} legislative aide to House Minority Leader Marvin Barkis, and the following year was an administrative assistant to House Majority Leader Donna Whiteman. From 1991 to 1995, Isenhour served as Chief of Staff to House Minority Leader Tom Sawyer, where she worked with Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike to advance legislation, served as a liaison between Sawyer and other officials, and worked with members <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> committees to develop legislative strategies and build coalitions. In 1992, Isenhour was the director of the Democratic Party's Kansas Coordinated Campaign for legislative races, both in the state House and Senate. Those races included more than three dozen candidates by July 1992.|$|E
5|$|A {{third major}} {{criticism}} of the Act {{is that it was}} poorly administered. The Act purposefully brought together competing interests (labor and business, big business and small business, etc.) in a coalition to support passage of the legislation, but these competing interests soon fought one another over the Act's implementation. As a consequence, NRA collapsed due to failure <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> confusion about its goals. By the end of 1934, NRA leaders had practically abandoned the progressive interventionist policy which motivated the Act's passage, and were supporting free-market philosophies—contributing to the collapse of almost all industry codes.|$|E

5|$|The 1881 year-end {{retrospective}} of the Pacific Commercial Advertiser {{was focused on}} Kalākaua's journey. The newspaper took a wait-and-see attitude about what {{the impact of the}} tour would be, but looked optimistically towards the kingdom having a more secure future as an independent nation. It gave much credit to Liliuokalani for rising to the occasion as a capable ruler who gained respect for her performance as temporary Regent.

5|$|The President of the United States of America, {{authorized}} by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, {{takes pride in}} presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal (Posthumously) to Major General Clarence R. Edwards, United States Army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. After having organized the 26th Division, General Edwards commanded it with distinction during all but 18 days of its active service at the front. The high qualities <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> unfailing devotion to duty displayed by him {{were responsible for the}} marked espirit and morale of his command. To his marked tactical ability and energy are largely due the brilliant successes achieved by the 26th National Guard Division during its operations against the enemy from 4 February 1918 to 11 November 1918. General Edwards died 14 February 1931.|$|E
5|$|The {{event has}} been {{described}} by historians as a decapitation strike, which was intended to deprive the Armenian population <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> a chance for resistance.
