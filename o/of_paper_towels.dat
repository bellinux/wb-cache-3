25|$|Scrolls can {{be rolled}} {{in one of}} two ways. The first method is to wrap the scroll around a single core, similar to a modern roll <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels.</b> While simple to construct, a single core scroll has a major disadvantage: in order to read text {{at the end of the}} scroll, the entire scroll must be unwound. This is {{partially}} overcome in the second method, which is to wrap the scroll around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double scroll, the text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of the scroll not being read can remain wound. This still leaves the scroll a sequential-access medium: to reach a given page, one generally has to unroll and re-roll many other pages.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the television show The Wonder Years. Homer's flashbacks to his childhood were based on the plot of the film Stand By Me, which in turn is based on Stephen King's novella The Body. However, the scenes in the quarry were based on the coming of age film Breaking Away, directed by Peter Yates. Burly, the brand <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> featured in the episode, is based on the real brand Brawny Paper Towels. The model for Burly paper towels, called Chad Sexington, was based on the Brawny paper towels' logo; however, the logo, within [...] "a year or two of [...] ", was changed into a more [...] "right-of-center" [...] looking brunette, according to Dean Moore. One of the walls in Pimento Grove shows photos of several characters and guest stars who have appeared on The Simpsons, including Birch Barlow, Stephen Hawking, and Ringo Starr. Mesmerino later reads a letter in a similarly to Carnac the Magnificent, played by Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Mama Celeste also appears in the episode, when Homer fantasizes the image on the box coming to life, only for it to threaten him with a pizza cutter: [...] "You touch-a me, and I cut you!" ...|$|E
500|$|Weinberg rose {{to success}} as the drummer for Springsteen's E Street Band, as his {{powerful}} yet controlled beat solved the E Street Band's drumming instabilities. On Born to Run (1975), Weinberg's drumming evoked {{two of his}} idols, Ringo Starr and Levon Helm, and he covered his snare drum with heavy paper towels to capture some of the Memphis soul sound. While travelling on tour, Weinberg became known for his exact requests, such as specifying the particular brand <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> to use for his drums or the standards for his hotel rooms. Weinberg never adopted the [...] "rock and roll lifestyle"; he treated his music seriously and kept to the mantra, [...] "Show up, do a good job, and give them more than their money's worth." [...] One compromise Weinberg did have to make was sometimes playing on the High Holy Days. During shows, Springsteen built up the personas of his bandmates, and Weinberg was frequently referred to as [...] "the Mighty Max". Weinberg started a long practice of keeping his eyes on Springsteen every moment during the show, even when Springsteen was behind the stage, as he never knew when Springsteen would change a tempo or suddenly deviate from the set list. Decades later, E Street guitarist Steve Van Zandt would say of Weinberg, [...] "What nobody understands is {{that not only is}} Max a great drummer, Max reads Bruce's mind. You can't learn that." [...] Weinberg bought a house overlooking the water in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, triggering a lifelong interest in real estate and home design.|$|E

Commercial usage, or otherwise any use outside of the North American household, accounts for one third of North American consumption. [...] The growth in commercial use <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> {{can be attributed to the}} migration from folded towels (in public bathrooms, for example) to roll towel dispensers, which reduces the amount <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> used by each patron.|$|E

50|$|Paper is {{made from}} either virgin or {{recycled}} paper pulp which is extracted from wood or fiber crops. They are sometimes bleached during the production process to lighten the paper's coloration. It {{is not uncommon for}} rolls <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> to include intricate colored images on each square (such as flowers or teddy bears). Resin size is used to improve the wet strength. Paper towels are packed individually and sold as stacks, or are held on a continuous roll, and come in two distinct classes: domestic and institutional. Many companies produce paper towels some of which include, but are not limited to: Charmin, Bounty, Seventh Generation, Scott, and Viva among many others.|$|E

40|$|Cellulose, {{which is}} one of the most-abundant and -renewable natural resources, has been {{extensively}} explored as an alternative substance for electrode materials such as activated carbons. Here, we demonstrate a new class of coffee-mediated green activation of cellulose as a new environmentally benign chemical-activation strategy and its potential use for all-paper flexible supercapacitors. A piece <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> is soaked in espresso coffee (acting as a natural activating agent) and then pyrolyzed to yield paper-derived activated carbons (denoted as EK-ACs). Potassium ions (K+), a core ingredient of espresso, play a viable role in facilitating pyrolysis kinetics and also in achieving a well-developed microporous structure in the EK-ACs. As a result, the EK-ACs show significant improvement in specific capacitance (131 F g- 1 at a scan rate of 1. 0 mV s- 1) over control ACs (64 F g- 1) obtained from the carbonization <b>of</b> a pristine <b>paper</b> <b>towel.</b> All-paper flexible supercapacitors are fabricated by assembling EK-ACs/carbon nanotube mixture-embedded <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> (as electrodes), poly(vinyl alcohol) /KOH mixture-impregnated <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> (as electrolytes), and polydimethylsiloxane-infiltrated <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> (as packaging substances). The introduction of the EK-ACs (as an electrode material) and the <b>paper</b> <b>towel</b> (as a deformable and compliant substrate) enables the resulting all-paper supercapacitor to provide reliable and sustainable cell performance as well as exceptional mechanical flexibility. Notably, no appreciable loss in the cell capacitance is observed after repeated bending (over 5000 cycles) or multiple folding. The coffee-mediated green activation of cellulose and the resultant all-paper flexible supercapacitors open new material and system opportunities for eco-friendly high-performance flexible power sources...|$|R

When I look at Scheinfeld’s photographs, I experience loss and disbelief. Graffiti and mildew streak the once-magnificent multi-tier lobby at Grossinger’s in Liberty. A moldering roll <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> lies on the flooded kitchen floor of the Pines in South Fallsburg. A hallway overpass at the Pines is a wreck of drooping fiberglass insulation. And yet the work is compelling for more than its depiction of disaster and decay.

50|$|In 1907, the Scott Paper Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{introduced}} paper tissues to {{help prevent}} the spread of colds from cloth towels in restrooms. Popular belief is that this was partly accidental and was the solution to a railroad car full of long paper rolls meant for toilet paper that were unsuitable to cut into rolls of toilet paper. In 1919, William E. Corbin, Henry Chase, and Harold Titus began experimenting with paper towels in the Research and Development building of the Brown Company in Berlin, New Hampshire. By 1922, Corbin perfected their product and began mass-producing it at the Cascade Mill on the Berlin/Gorham line. This product was called Nibroc Paper Towels (Corbin spelled backwards). In 1931, the Scott Paper Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, introduced their paper towel rolls for kitchens; they are now the leading manufacturer <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{sheet of}} {{nitrocellulose}} (or, alternatively, nylon) membrane {{is placed on}} top of (or below, depending on {{the direction of the}} transfer) the gel. Pressure is applied evenly to the gel (either using suction, or by placing a stack <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>towels</b> and a weight on top of the membrane and gel), to ensure good and even contact between gel and membrane. If transferring by suction, 20X SSC buffer is used to ensure a seal and prevent drying of the gel. Buffer transfer by capillary action from a region of high water potential to a region of low water potential (usually filter paper and paper tissues) is then used to move the DNA from the gel onto the membrane; ion exchange interactions bind the DNA to the membrane due to the negative charge of the DNA and positive charge of the membrane.|$|E
