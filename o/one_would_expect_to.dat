5|$|Either {{side of the}} Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which {{contains}} a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase {{to the east of}} the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.|$|E

25|$|The {{advertising}} {{program for the}} Crown Jewels sandwiches featured the slogan Flash, but not too flash which was an inference stating while they cost more than the standard burger offerings at BK, they were {{not as much as}} <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> pay at a higher end outlet. The products were introduced in a series of three pairs of commercials in both 15 and 30 second formats. The commercials featured animals such as snails or frogs that are used as exotic cuisine in various regions of the world. As the narrator announces BK is looking for new and more complex ingredients for their new line of sandwiches, the animals are shown reacting in a fearful way believing they are the new ingredients. At the end, the narrator declares one of the new flavors and the animal is relieved to find out they are not food, then they are promptly dispatched by the new food item (e.g. the frog is hit with a mango).|$|E
25|$|To {{determine}} which epitopes are shared between pathogen and self, large protein databases are used. The largest protein database in the world, {{known as the}} UniProt database (formerly SwissProt), has shown reports of molecular mimicry becoming more common with expansion of the database. The database currently contains 1.5 X 107 residues. The probability of finding a perfect match with a motif of 5 amino acids in length is 1 in 3.7 X 10−7 (0.055). Therefore, within the SwissProt database, <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find 1.5 X 107 X 3.7 X 10−7 = 5 matches. However, there are sequence motifs within the database that are overrepresented and are found more than 5 times. For example, the QKRAA sequence is an amino acid motif in the third hypervariable region of HLA-DRB1*0401. This motif is also expressed on numerous other proteins, such as on gp110 of the Epstein-Barr virus and in E. coli. This motif occurs 37 times in the database. This {{would suggest that the}} linear amino acid sequence may not be an underlying cause of molecular mimicry since it can be found numerous times within the database. The possibility exists, then, for variability within amino acid sequence, but similarity in three-dimensional structure between two peptides can be recognized by T cell clones. This, therefore, uncovers a flaw of such large databases. They may be able to give a hint to relationships between epitopes, but the important three-dimensional structure cannot yet be searched for in such a database.|$|E

500|$|Another great {{passion that}} is {{depicted}} in Traherne's work is his love {{of nature and the}} natural world, frequently displayed in a very Romantic treatment of nature that has been described as characteristically pantheist or panentheist. While Traherne credits a divine source for its creation, his praise of nature seems nothing less than what <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find in Thoreau. Many scholars consider Traherne a writer of the sublime, and in his writing he seems to have tried to reclaim the lost appreciation for the natural world, as well as paying tribute to what he knew of in nature that was more powerful than he was. In this sense Traherne seems to have anticipated the Romantic movement more than 130 years before it actually occurred. There is frequent discussion of man's almost symbiotic relationship with nature, as well as frequent use of [...] "literal setting", that is, an attempt to faithfully reproduce a sense experience from a given moment, a technique later used frequently by William Wordsworth.|$|E

500|$|Exceptions {{are made}} for {{children}} and a person [...] "in the exercise of his calling" [...] (a professional person or somebody exercising a trade or skill). With children, occupiers must [...] "be prepared for children to be less careful than adults"; a warning notice, for example, would normally {{be good enough to}} alert adults to a potential danger, but not to alert children. This is another extension of a common law principle; in Glasgow Corporation v Taylor [...] 1 AC 44, a seven-year-old child died after eating poisonous berries from a bush in a park. The berries, which looked like cherries or blackcurrants, were found by the House of Lords to constitute an [...] "allurement" [...] to the child, who found Glasgow Corporation, which owned the park, liable. However, the situation is different if the child has a guardian with him, who <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> appreciate any obvious dangers, as in Phipps v Rochester Corporation [...] 1 QB 450.

500|$|Bell et al. {{wrote that}} while there was an ongoing debate over the origins of homosexuality, there is {{evidence}} supporting the view that homosexuality has a biological basis, and that hormonal factors could be involved. Though they acknowledged that their study {{did not have the}} necessary data to explain how sexual preference might be related to biology, Bell et al. wrote that their findings were consistent with what <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find if sexual preference had a biological basis. They suggested that biological factors probably have a more powerful influence on exclusive homosexuals than on bisexuals, and {{that if there is a}} biological basis to homosexuality, it probably accounts for gender nonconformity as well as sexual orientation. They also proposed that the [...] "familial factors commonly thought to account for homosexuality" [...] may actually result from the way parents react to their prehomosexual children. Bell et al. argued that demonstrating that homosexuality is biologically innate would lead to greater social tolerance, and help to relieve parents of gay people of guilt. They expressed hope that researchers would eventually produce more definitive answers about the origins of homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|In {{looking to}} give each episode of the series a {{distinct}} feel, showrunner Steven Moffat pitched the Wild West theme to writer Toby Whithouse, suggesting that the episode could be about a town terrorised by a robot. Moffat was keen on putting Matt Smith in a Western setting, who he {{called one of the}} last people <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> replace Clint Eastwood. Whithouse had previously written the Doctor Who episodes [...] "School Reunion" [...] (2006), [...] "The Vampires of Venice" [...] (2010), and [...] "The God Complex" [...] (2011). Moffat had been planning for the first five episodes of the series to have [...] "movie marquee" [...] themes. Whithouse noted that it was a genre he had not written before, but he [...] "absolutely [...] it". The Wild West has not been a setting for a Doctor Who episode since the 1966 third season serial The Gunfighters. Whithouse was advised not to watch The Gunfighters by the other writers, who said it was [...] "not exactly the jewel in the crown". Whithouse felt obliged to include common Western tropes, such as the Doctor riding a horse and a face-off. He stated the hardest scene to write was where the Doctor is forced to use a gun; the Doctor is a pacifist and he would need [...] "the right sort of emotional journey".|$|E

500|$|Speirs was {{captain of}} the side and in the days up to the final {{he wrote to his}} {{opposite}} number, Colin Veitch. The contents of his letter are not known, but in his reply, Veitch said Speirs had [...] "expressed in sound terms the true spirit of comradeship, and the proper sentiments <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> see associated with the sportsman, and the sport". Speirs led out a team which contained eight Scots for the final at the Crystal Palace on 22 April 1911 against Newcastle United. The game ended in a 0–0 draw, in what was described as a [...] "decidedly dull and uneventful game". The final replay was played four days later at Old Trafford, Manchester, with City making [...] one change to the team, bringing in Bob Torrance for fellow Scottish defender Willie Gildea. After 15minutes, Speirs scored {{what turned out to be}} the only goal of the game to win the cup. Robinson shot at goal, but the wind caught the ball, which was headed on by Frank Thompson. Speirs himself headed the ball at goal, and Newcastle's goalkeeper Jimmy Lawrence was distracted by City striker Frank O'Rourke and the ball rolled into the net. Speirs lifted the newly-cast trophy, which had been made by Bradford jewellers Fattorinis, and displayed it on the club's victory parade later that evening in Bradford. The following day, Speirs was pictured on the front page of the Daily Mirror newspaper, holding the cup.|$|E

The results are surprising. They indicate that the CAPM has worked well in the small Icelandic stock market and that it, or the beta coefficient, does explain returns better than on larger foreign stock markets. There was a strong relationship between the beta coefficient and stock returns in this research. Further, the stock returns with high betas were higher than <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> according <b>to</b> the CAPM.
