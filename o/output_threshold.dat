40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we propose two novel low-complexity, low-delay erasure {{insertion}} schemes, namely, the <b>output</b> <b>threshold</b> test (OTT) and joint maximum output and ratio threshold Test (MO-RTT). The employment of the OTT and MO-RTT is beneficial {{in the context of}} the “errors-and-erasures” Reed–Solomon (RS) decoding in a slow frequency-hopping spread-spectrum (SFH/SS) system using -ary frequency-shift keying (MFSK). The statistics of the erasure insertion related decision variables associated with the OTT, MO-RTT as well as with the ratio threshold test (RTT) are investigated, when the channel of each frequency-hopping (FH) slot is modeled as flat Nakagamifading. The transmitted signals also experience both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) as well as partial-band Gaussian interference (PBGI). The properties of these erasure insertion schemes are investigated with the aid of their statistics. The performance of the proposed erasure insertion schemes and that of the erasure insertion scheme using the RTT is investigated and compared in the context of RS coded SFH/SS systems using MFSK. Furthermore, the performance of the RS coded SFH/SS systems is also compared both with and without side-information concerning the PBGI.

40|$|Purpose: The {{observation}} {{periods and}} thresholds of serum creatinine and urine output {{defined in the}} Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria were not empirically derived. By continuously varying creatinine/urine <b>output</b> <b>thresholds</b> {{as well as the}} observation period, we sought to investigate the empirical relationships among creatinine, oliguria, in-hospital mortality, and receipt of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Methods: Using a high-resolution database (Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II), we extracted data from 17, 227 critically ill patients with an in-hospital mortality rate of 10. 9 %. The 14, 526 patients had urine output measurements. Various combinations of creatinine/urine <b>output</b> <b>thresholds</b> and observation periods were investigated by building multivariate logistic regression models for in-hospital mortality and RRT predictions. For creatinine, both absolute and percentage increases were analyzed. To visualize the dependence of adjusted mortality and RRT rate on creatinine, the urine output, and the observation period, we generated contour plots. Results: Mortality risk was high when absolute creatinine increase was high regardless of the observation period, when percentage creatinine increase was high and the observation period was long, and when oliguria was sustained {{for a long period of}} time. Similar contour patterns emerged for RRT. The variability in predictive accuracy was small across different combinations of thresholds and observation periods.

Establishing standardized electrical measurements can provide necessary information for designers, and measuring transistor electrical characteristics establishes its equivalent-circuit model for circuit simulations. Moreover, high power output requires multiple parallel power transistors, and sorting the difference between similar electrical characteristics is critical in a power system.

40|$|A neural {{model is}} {{developed}} of how motion integration and segmentation processes compute global motion percepts. Figure-ground properties, such as occlusion, influence which motion signals determine the percept. For visible apertures, a line’s extrinsic terminators do not specify true line motion. For invisible apertures, a line’s intrinsic terminators create veridical feature tracking signals, which are amplified before they propagate across space and are integrated with ambiguous motion signals within line interiors. This integration {{process is the}} result of several processing stages: directional transient cells respond to image transients and input to a directional short-range filter that selectively boosts feature tracking signals. Competitive interactions further boost feature tracking signals and create speed-selective receptive fields. A long-range filter gives rise to true directional cells by pooling signals over multiple orientations and opposite contrast polarities. A distributed population code of speed tuning realizes a size–speed correlation, whereby activations of multiple spatially shortrange filters of different sizes are transformed into speed-tuned cell responses.

40|$|Abstract—with {{increasing}} circuits ’ {{complexity and}} demand to use portable devices, power consumption {{is one of}} the most important parameters these days. Full adders are the basic block of many circuits. Therefore reducing power consumption in full adders is very important in low power circuits. One of the most powerconsuming modules in full adders is XOR/XNOR circuit. This paper presents two new full adders based on two new logic approaches. The proposed logic approaches use one XOR or XNOR gate to implement a full adder cell. Therefore, delay and power will be decreased. Using two new approaches and two XOR and XNOR gates, two new full adders have been implemented in this paper. Simulations are carried out by HSPICE in 0. 18 µm bulk technology with 1. 8 V supply voltage. The results show that the ten-transistors proposed full adder has 12 % less power consumption and is 5 % faster in comparison to MB 12 T full adder. 9 T is more efficient in area and is 24 % better than similar 10 T full adder in term of power consumption.
