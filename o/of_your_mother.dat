Liz congratulates them and tells the two that their son will have an old dad as Jack is in his early 50s. As {{a result of what}} Liz said, Jack fears that he will not be around so he decides to teach his unborn son how to live by {{recording}} a video containing advice for him. Later, Jack learns that he and Avery are in fact expecting a daughter and not a son.

2500|$|... "The hateful {{murder of}} your mother" ... "has shocked me {{just as it}} has shocked all the French and all those who defend press freedom", Chirac said. [...] "You should {{understand}} {{how important it is}} to France that everything be done to ensure justice is done and that the murderers <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> be found and punished." ...|$|E
60|$|ANDERSON. Mr. Dudgeon {{you are in}} the {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> and her grief.|$|E
60|$|LORD CAVERSHAM. It is {{the secret}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother’s</b> happiness. You are very heartless, sir, very heartless.|$|R
6000|$|... "One always remembers Italy; the {{distance}} makes no difference. I remembered it well the day I heard <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> death!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh—a private affair. I {{thought it}} would be some church matter <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's.</b> She's very big at the church, isn't she?" ...|$|R
60|$|CRAMPTON (holding her hand). My dear: I'm afraid I spoke very {{improperly}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> this afternoon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I understand," [...] Frank {{reassured}} her. [...] "Besides, I {{think you}} are right. But I was thinking <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> She won't come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Since {{the death}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> all has been indefinite--all!' he said gloomily. That was the whole. Possibly, Wherryborne Rectory may see him no more.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Did I not bid {{you speak}} the truth, Teule? If <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> was one <b>of</b> them, must you not also be of them; for {{are you not}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> bone and blood?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} any <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> relations?" [...] Mr. Ravenor asked, taking no notice of the {{qualifying}} addition to my previous answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Fitzgerald," [...] {{continued}} the lawyer, [...] "I {{do not know}} how far you may be acquainted with the history <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> first marriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are the {{daughter}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> dear Isobel," [...] he said. [...] "Beyond that, {{what is there}} that I can say--I, who loved her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank ye, Martin," [...] replied she; [...] "it {{was very}} good <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> {{fetching}} me. She's been the best friend I've had many a day." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then she fetched, {{from the}} upper chamber, a box full of money, which she laid before him, saying, 'That is the price <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> She sold well.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Red light!" [...] {{commanded}} the Voice. [...] "Approach--quietly. Victor, take charge <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> body. She will not re-enter it. Her spirit is with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{care what}} Carew said--and I don't care whether you approve <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> sitting {{for me or}} not. Her {{controls}} will decide that question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a direct}} materialization," [...] confessed Mrs. Joyce. [...] "My own feeling is that your {{grandfather}} sent it to assure us <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anne," [...] he pleaded, [...] "{{not because}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> {{not because you}} would make me a {{suitable}} wife, but because I love you, will you marry me?" ...|$|E
60|$|You have {{then all}} the loveliness of Nature, {{combined}} {{with the hope of}} a future joy, which Art--the art <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> or whoever roasts the corn--will give you.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lord Cadurcis, this childish {{nonsense}} must cease; it {{has already}} endangered the life <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> nor can I answer for her safety, if you lose a moment in returning.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Keep it and welcome. My {{mother gave}} it to me; and when you read it try to believe that neither <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mothers</b> will ever forget you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For long years, my son, I can scarce {{recall a}} moment that the radiant vision <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> face has not been ever before me. Tell me of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, Rima, {{that your}} {{grandfather}} has now told me your history--how he found <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> at this place, {{and took her}} to Voa, where you were born; but <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> people he knows nothing, and therefore he can now take you no further." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rima," [...] I said, [...] "do you {{remember}} where we first talked together {{under a tree}} one morning, when you spoke <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> telling {{me that she was}} dead?" ...|$|E
6000|$|ALICE. 'The {{more you}} ask <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{the more she}} has to give. It is my love you need, Amy; and you can draw upon it, and draw upon it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. But {{you know}} I don't {{pretend to be}} an {{authority}} in such matters. As far as they go, I am always in the hands <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> and you children." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why an't you <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> way <b>of</b> thinking, my dear?' {{said the}} dwarf, turing round and {{addressing}} his wife, 'why don't you always imitate <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> my dear? She's the ornament of her sex--your father said so {{every day of}} his life. I am sure he did.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now {{let me hear}} it,' he said soothingly. 'You {{may tell}} me with the {{greatest}} freedom. I was a friend <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's,</b> you know. That is, I knew her; and I'll be a friend of yours.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You rebellious spirit! You mutinous child! Tell me this, Lavinia. If in {{violation}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> sentiments, you had condescended to {{allow yourself to}} be patronized by the Boffins, {{and if you had}} come from those halls of slavery--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{later the}} better, Jolyon; the young have such cheap, hard judgment. When you were {{nineteen}} {{what would you}} have thought <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> if she had done what I have?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Abner," [...] {{said the}} father, with the {{deliberation}} with which all his proceedings were characterised, [...] "take the brother <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> from the wagon, {{and let him}} stand on the 'arth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'For God's sake, Sire! For {{the love}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> spare him!' she cried, falling upon her knees at the Emperor's feet. 'I will answer {{for him that}} he never offends you again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is my wish, Mr. Ladislaw, to {{make amends}} for the {{deprivation}} which befell <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> I {{know that you are}} without fortune, and I wish to supply you adequately from a store which would have probably already been yours had your grandmother been certain <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> existence and been able to find her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd make a {{case out}} of my {{grandmother}} if as much hinged on her as swings on this question <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> honesty. You can't blink these charges, Vic, they'll have to be met if she remains in the city." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was more}} shocked than {{surprised}} by the receipt <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> announcement <b>of</b> our poor dear Marguerite's death. When I heard of the consultation, and recalled what had preceded it and what I have seen here, my hopes were very slight.|$|R
