40|$|This article explores whether {{proposed}} {{changes to the}} regulation of <b>synthetic</b> <b>securitisation</b> in Australia are sufficient {{in light of the}} Global Financial Crisis. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>securitisation</b> is specifically chosen as an object of study, given the relative ease with which it can be over-used. The article examines several theoretical problems with securitisation, which entice corporations into excessively risky behaviour. Contrary to popular belief, it is established that agency issues are not a serious problem with securitisation. Instead, managerial behavioural biases are shown to be most problematic. The article recommends stricter capital adequacy relief requirements, which would provide a disincentive for excessive risk-taking by potentially over-confident managers...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to critically analyse <b>synthetic</b> <b>securitisation</b> schemes in South African law as synthetic collateralised debt obligations using primarily credit default swaps (CDSs). This transpires {{from the perspective of}} primarily company law, and secondarily securities law and the law of contract. It includes a contextualised study of these schemes with regards to their origins, their significance regarding the recent financial crisis, and their rationales micro-economic influence and Basel capital requirements. Not only are the participants, such as parties acting in a primary role and secondary role and special-purpose institutions, studied, but also the obligations between these parties, such as the CDS contract, and the meaning of commercial paper, the legal nature of credit-linked notes, the business of a bank, and the influence of recent case law. It also includes a consideration of <b>synthetic</b> <b>securitisation</b> schemes in terms of the Collective Investment Schemes Control Act 45 of 2002. Furthermore, the role of systemic risk and moral hazard is explained, as well as the interaction between <b>synthetic</b> <b>securitisation</b> schemes, credit rating agencies and the function of risk management. The CDS is compared with insurance contracts, and a discussion of the 2014 International Swaps and Derivatives Association Credit Derivative Definitions is incorporated. For legal comparison, the South African model is compared with Canadian law and its unfunded credit derivatives in the light of recent regulation, and compared to German law and its prevalence of funded credit derivatives.

40|$|Recently, {{a number}} of organisations have called for open access to {{scientific}} information and especially to the data obtained from publicly funded research, among which the Royal Society report and the European Commission press release are particularly notable. It has long been accepted that building research on the foundations laid by other scientists is both effective and efficient. Regrettably, some disciplines, chemistry being one, {{have been slow to}} recognise the value of sharing and have thus been reluctant to curate their data and information in preparation for exchanging it. The very significant increases in both the volume and the complexity of the datasets produced has encouraged the expansion of e-Research, and stimulated the development of methodologies for managing, organising, and analysing "big data". We review the evolution of cheminformatics, the amalgam of chemistry, computer science, and information technology, and assess the wider e-Science and e-Research perspective. Chemical information does matter, as do matters of communicating data and collaborating with data. For chemistry, unique identifiers, structure representations, and property descriptors are essential to the activities of sharing and exchange. Open science entails the sharing of more than mere facts: for example, the publication of negative outcomes can facilitate better understanding <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>synthetic</b> routes to choose, an aspiration of the Dial-a-Molecule Grand Challenge. The protagonists of open notebook science go even further and exchange their thoughts and plans.

Results show that the combination of a nanocircle and a DNA polymerase gives a positive telomere-repeat amplification protocol assay result for telomerase activity, and similar to the natural enzyme, it is inhibited by a known telomerase inhibitor. We show that artificial telomeres can be engineered on human chromosomes by this approach. This strategy allows for the preparation of synthetic telomeres for biological and structural study of telomeres and proteins that interact with them, and it raises the possibility of telomere engineering in cells without expression of telomerase itself. Finally, the results provide direct physical support for a recently proposed rolling-circle mechanism for telomerase-independent telomere elongation...|$|R

40|$|Reflection {{artifacts}} {{caused by}} acoustic inhomogeneities constitute {{a major problem}} in epi-mode biomedical photoacoustic imaging. Photoacoustic transients from the skin and superficial optical absorbers traverse into the tissue and reflect off echogenic structures to generate reflection artifacts. These artifacts cause difficulties in the interpretation of images and reduce contrast and imaging depth. We recently developed a method called PAFUSion (photoacoustic-guided focused ultrasound) to circumvent the problem of reflection artifacts in photoacoustic imaging. We already demonstrated that the photoacoustic signals can be backpropagated using synthetic aperture pulse-echo data for identifying and reducing reflection artifacts in vivo. In this work, we propose an alternative variant <b>of</b> PAFUSion in <b>which</b> <b>synthetic</b> backpropagation <b>of</b> photoacoustic signals is based on multi-angled plane-wave ultrasound measurements. We implemented plane-wave and synthetic aperture PAFUSion in a handheld ultrasound/photoacoustic imaging system and demonstrate reduction of reflection artifacts in phantoms and in vivo measurements on a human finger using both approaches. Our results suggest that, while both approaches are equivalent in terms of artifact reduction efficiency, plane-wave PAFUSion requires less pulse echo acquisitions when the skin absorption is the main cause of reflection artifacts...|$|R

This lipid organization, including the characteristic 13 nm lamellar phase, can be reproduced in vitro with mixtures based on cholesterol, free fatty acids and natural as well as synthetic ceramides (CER). In human SC, nine CER classes have been identified (CER 1 –CER 9). Detailed studies on the effect of molecular structure of individual ceramides on the SC lipid organization are only possible with synthetic lipid mixtures, as their composition can be accurately chosen and systematically modified. In the present study, small-angle X-ray diffraction was used to examine the {{organization in}} <b>synthetic</b> lipid mixtures <b>of</b> <b>which</b> the <b>synthetic</b> ceramide fraction was prepared with sphingosine-based CER 1 or phytosphingosine-based CER 9. The latter acylceramide contains an additional hydroxyl group at the sphingoid backbone. The results show that a gradual increase in CER 1 level consistently promotes the formation of the 13 nm lamellar phase and that partial replacement of CER 1 by CER 9 does not affect the phase behavior. Interestingly, complete substitution of CER 1 with CER 9 reduces the formation of the long periodicity phase and results in phase separation of CER 9...|$|R

These include tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI- 1), leptin, resistine and adiponectin. These are collectively known as adipocytokines. Adiponectin (also referred to as AdipoQ, Acrp 30, apM 1 or GBP 28) is a novel adipose-specific protein. A recent genome study mapped a susceptibility locus for type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome on chromosome 3 q 27, where the adiponectin gene is located. Adiponectin is a peculiar adipocytokine because in contrast to the markedly increased levels of many others, as leptin or TNF-alpha, its level is reduced in obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Blue feathers, in which colour is based on the microstructural arrangement of keratin, air and melanin granules, and green feathers, which combine structural blue with yellow psittacofulvins, degraded at a rate similar to that of red and black feathers.

40|$|Background: Synthetic lethal genetic {{interaction}} {{analysis has}} been successfully applied to predicting the functions of genes and their pathway identities. In the context of synthetic lethal interaction data alone, the global similarity of synthetic lethal interaction patterns between two genes is used to predict gene function. With physical interaction data, such as proteinprotein interactions, the enrichment of physical interactions within subsets of genes and the enrichment of synthetic lethal interactions between those subsets of genes are used {{as an indication of}} compensatory pathways. Result: In this paper, we propose a method of mapping genetically compensatory pathways from synthetic lethal interactions. Our method is designed to discover pairs <b>of</b> gene-sets in <b>which</b> <b>synthetic</b> lethal interactions are depleted among the genes in an individual set and where such gene-set pairs are connected by many synthetic lethal interactions. By its nature, our method could select compensatory pathway pairs that buffer the deleterious effect of the failure of either one, without the need of physical interaction data. By focusing on compensatory pathway pairs where genes in each individual pathway have a highly homogenous cellular function, we show that many cellular functions have genetically compensatory properties. Conclusion: We conclude that synthetic lethal interaction data are a powerful source to map genetically compensatory pathways, especially in systems lacking physical interaction information, and that the cellular function network contain...|$|R
