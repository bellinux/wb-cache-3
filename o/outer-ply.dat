Exact details for post-to-truss connections vary from designer to designer, {{and may be}} influenced by post type. Solid-sawn timber and glulam posts are generally notched to form a truss bearing surface. The truss is rested on the notches and bolted into place. A special plate/bracket may be added to increase connection load transfer capabilities. With mechanically-laminated posts, the truss may rest on a shortened <b>outer-ply</b> or on a shortened inner-ply. The later scenario places the bolts in double shear and is a very effective connection.|$|E

[90 m/ 0 n] s) has some important di#erences from the microcracking process in laminates which lack <b>outer-ply</b> 90 # plies (e. g. [0 n / 90 m] s). Foremost among the di#erences is the characteristic damage state. [90 m/ 0 n] s laminates form antisymmetric or staggered microcracks while [0 n / 90 m] s laminates form symmetric microcracks. To explain observed di#erences, {{this paper presents}} a variational mechanics analysis of the stresses and the energy release rate in a [90 m/ 0 n] s laminate having staggered microcracks. The new analysis and a previous analysis of [0 m / 90 n] s laminates are {{used to assess the}} e#ect of laminate structure on the mechanical properties and failure properties of cross-ply laminates. The findings are: 1. A given level of microcracking damage causes a greater amount of degradation in mechanical properties in [90 m/ 0 n] s laminates than in the corresponding [0 n / 90 m] s laminates. 2. Although [90 m/ 0 n] s laminates will initiate microcracks at lower loads, the corresponding [0 n / 90 m] s laminates will develop more microcracks after continued loading. 3. A bending e#ect present in [90 m/ 0 n] s laminates but not in [0 n / 90 m] s laminates promotes mode I delamination in [90 m/ 0 n] s laminates...|$|E
