5|$|In August 2006 the Jerusalem District Court upheld three earlier {{arbitration}} rulings {{and ordered}} Karta to pay Akirov NIS 100 million for project delays. Akirov resumed construction {{and opened the}} mall in stages from 2007 to 2008, bringing closure to a 37-year project that normally should have taken five to ten years. The 194-room Alrov Mamilla Jerusalem Hotel, anchored {{on the north side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> opened in June 2009.|$|E
5|$|Merle Hay Plaza was {{enclosed}} in 1972 and became Merle Hay Mall. Two years later, as Valley West Mall and Southridge Mall were under construction, Merle Hay Mall completed a major westward expansion that doubled the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> Two additional anchors, Montgomery Ward (which also moved from downtown) and Younkers Store for Homes, {{were added to}} the mall as part of that expansion. By 2000, Merle Hay Mall attracted an average of 35,000 shoppers per day.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} following, Cardinal and the county’s {{licensing}} and inspection department fell into dispute about <b>the</b> <b>mall’s</b> condition. [...] <b>The</b> local government claimed that Cardinal had not properly maintained <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> property. Cardinal’s property manager maintained that <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> had a full-time maintenance worker, {{and that a}} crew had repaired a leaky roof and cleaned mold out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall’s</b> interior.|$|R

5|$|The {{construction}} of the center cost $1.5 million, contained 1,200 parking spaces, and was anchored by a Country Club Market grocery store. For many years, the mall offered a seasonal shuttle that ferried shoppers around the facilities; this service was discontinued in the late 1990s.

5|$|As {{the number}} of {{expected}} participants grew, the rally was moved from {{the grounds of the}} Washington Monument to the east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mall</b> facing the Capitol. The stage was {{on the east side of}} the rally with an open back, allowing the Capitol building to provide the backdrop for the performances. In order to meet the public safety requirements of the National Park Service permit, the Mall between the Capitol and 14th Street was divided into sections, with access aisles lined by portable fences. Speakers and jumbotron television screens were placed along both the north and south edges to encourage the crowd to spread out rather than press against the main stage.|$|E
5|$|East <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> {{the route}} passes through {{increasingly}} rural areas, {{with the exception}} of the hamlet of Egypt midway between NY250 and the Wayne County line. NY31 progresses onward into Wayne County, where the Rochester suburbs end as the route heads eastward through the mostly rural town of Macedon to the village of the same name. Prior to exiting the village, NY31 meets the southern terminus of NY350 and the eastern terminus of NY31F. The highway continues on, exiting the village and proceeding eastward through the town of Macedon, bordered by the Erie Canal to the north and Ganargua Creek to the south. In Palmyra, NY31 joins NY21 through the center of the village.|$|E
50|$|Filene's Basement, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> anchors, {{filed for}} {{bankruptcy}} protection on May 4, 2009. The store closed in 2011 and was converted to Sports Authority, which in turn ceased operations in July 2016.|$|R
50|$|Barrett Rochman {{purchased}} <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> in 2011 and renamed it Illinois Star Centre. In March 2015, the Southern Illinoisan {{reported that}} three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> owners were imprisoned on various counts, and that leasing agents were unresponsive on inquiries about <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> {{which has become}} increasingly vacant and lacking in maintenance. Also complicating <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> future is <b>the</b> fact that {{the parking lot and}} anchor stores are owned by different companies than <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> itself.|$|R
50|$|During Winter 2009, the Shopping Centre, {{underwent}} through Phase 1 of a Redevelopment. This contained new tiling, new {{lighting and}} {{bigger and more}} lighter entrances into each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>malls,</b> and was completed in Summer 2010.|$|R
5|$|I-96 {{passes through}} {{an area with}} several lakes as it crosses into Oakland County. This area {{includes}} the Island Lake State Recreation Area {{to the south and}} the Kensington Metropark {{to the north of the}} freeway in an area where it crosses the Huron River. The Interstate runs through Wixom into Novi, where it passes to the south of the Twelve Oaks Mall. Southeast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> I-96 enters a complex interchange on the border between Novi and Farmington Hills that connects it to M-5 (Haggerty Connector), I-275 and I-696 (Reuther Freeway). The trunkline drops a lane in each direction as it enters the interchange and turns southward. The freeway then merges into I-275 and increases to four lanes in each direction running south in Farmington Hills.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{officials}} announced their long-term plan {{to prevent further}} traffic jams. They will create a series of loops and overpasses allowing traffic to go directly from southbound Route32 to the Thruway and remove some traffic lights in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> The changes {{were expected to be}} complete by 2011, as part of improvements to convert the Route17 expressway into I-86. However, in 2009 they were postponed due to funding constraints. Work was slated to begin in 2013, but just before it could start Governor Andrew Cuomo redirected the money to repair projects elsewhere in the state. The project was put on indefinite hold in 2014 until it could be funded.|$|E
5|$|In Syracuse, NY5 is {{parallel}} to I-690 for much of its routing but never encounters the highway, thus making the north–south streets that intersect NY5 entry points to and from I-690. In downtown Syracuse, West Genesee Street becomes James Street. At {{the southern tip of}} the interchange between I-690 and I-81, NY5 transfers onto Erie Boulevard and intersects State Street (US11), but passes under I-81 without access. From the downtown area to DeWitt, NY5 is divided. At the Syracuse–DeWitt boundary, NY5 intersects NY635 and eastward, it curves to a southeast course. Near Shoppingtown Mall, NY5 turns east onto Genesee Street to begin an overlap with NY92. Less than a mile east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> NY5 and NY92 intersect I-481 at a cloverleaf interchange.|$|E
50|$|A huge snow {{storm in}} 1997 caused part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>mall's</b> roof to cave in, {{triggering}} the sprinklers and flooding <b>the</b> entire <b>mall</b> in 3 in of water. Because <b>of</b> water damage, <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> original wood parquet flooring {{was replaced with}} ceramic tile.|$|R
50|$|Also {{included}} as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University <b>Mall</b> is Costco, {{which is located}} in its own separate building to <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>mall.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> is owned, managed, and leased out by Woodbury Corporation. With 1500000 sq ft of retail space and 5,400 parking spaces it was at one time <b>the</b> largest shopping <b>mall</b> in <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> Utah.|$|R
50|$|Fairway's fifth store {{opened on}} March 25, 2009, in the Fashion Center {{shopping}} mall in suburban Paramus, New Jersey, taking up a majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> former interior space. This {{is the first}} Fairway store located west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hudson River.|$|R
5|$|NY254 {{begins at}} the {{southbound}} ramp of Adirondack Northway (I-87) exit19 north of Glens Falls {{in the town of}} Queensbury. The route heads eastward from the interchange as Aviation Road, passing by many commercial buildings and Aviation Mall. As it passes along the north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> NY254 curves to the southeast before veering back to the northeast ahead of an intersection with the four-lane US9 (Upper Glen Street). The route continues past US9; however, maintenance of the highway is transferred from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to Warren County at the US9 junction. Now co-designated as CR47, NY254 progresses eastward along the four-lane Quaker Road, serving as a northerly bypass of the city of Glens Falls.|$|E
5|$|The {{station and}} the nearby Queens Center Mall are served by nine local MTA Regional Bus Operations routes and two express bus routes. Three of the four Woodhaven Boulevard bus lines (Q11, Q21, Q52 Limited) {{terminate}} at the station, with the Q53 Limited bus continuing westward towards the Woodside – 61st Street Station. Except for the Q88, Rego Park-bound Q59, Jamaica-bound Q60, and Corona-bound Q38, all northbound buses stop at the mall entrance, while all southbound buses {{as well as the}} QM10 and QM11 express buses stop at Hoffman Drive adjacent to Hoffman Park. The Q88 terminates at 92nd Street, in between the two halves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Heather awakens at a shopping mall, having fallen asleep while dining at a burger joint; she had been dreaming of being trapped in a demented amusement park, forced to follow roller coaster tracks in her flight from monstrous creatures and subsequently being run down by the roller coaster. Before she can leave the mall, a private detective called Douglas Cartland confronts her, claiming to have information about her birth. Heather evades him and discovers that the mall is mostly abandoned except for monsters. She encounters Claudia, who hints about Heather's fate. Heather finds herself in the Otherworld version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> — monster-filled and decaying — and is eventually restored back to the original shopping mall where she encounters Douglas, who confesses that Claudia had hired him to find her. Heather leaves the mall and resolves to take the subway home. Having arrived at her residence, Heather discovers that her father has been killed by a monster under the orders of Claudia, who tells her that she will be waiting for her in Silent Hill and leaves.|$|E
50|$|Also {{leading to}} <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> demise was <b>the</b> opening <b>of</b> a Walmart Supercenter roughly {{a mile away}} from <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> drawing from <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> {{customer}} base. Around the same time, <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> Italian Oven restaurant closed, as {{it was discovered that}} the restaurant could not legally serve alcohol. By 2001, <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> food court would be devoid of restaurants. Kmart's bankruptcy filings in 2002 resulted in <b>the</b> closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> Kmart location; Phar-Mor would close the same year, also as part of bankruptcy.|$|R
