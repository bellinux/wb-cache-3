As the EEF advanced into Palestine, the major medical problem remained transportation. During the operations in the Es Salt area, Downes experimented with the delivery of drugs and medical supplies by air. In the Jordan valley in 1918, however, Downes was confronted with an epidemic of malaria and vigorous preventative and prophylactic efforts were {{required in order to}} bring it under control.|$|E

The DRECP also aimed to preserve 4.2million acres of land. Conservation groups viewed the initiative more favorably than did wind and solar developers, who criticized the DRECP for removing some public land designated for development.|$|E

5|$|During the Gallipoli Campaign four {{light horse}} brigades had been {{dismounted}} and fought alongside the infantry divisions. However, in March 1916 the ANZAC Mounted Division {{was formed in}} Egypt (so named because it contained one mounted brigade from New Zealand). Likewise, the Australian Mounted Division—formed in February 1917—was originally named the Imperial Mounted Division because it contained the British 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades. Each division consisted of three mounted light horse brigades, each of which consisted of three regiments. Following the expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Desert</b> Column in August 1917 these divisions formed part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Desert</b> Mounted Corps, which consisted of the ANZAC Mounted Division, Australian Mounted Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade (which included a number of Australian, British and New Zealand camel companies). The AIF also included the Australian Flying Corps (AFC), which consisted of four operational squadrons—Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, and four training squadrons—Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8. More than 2,000 women served with the AIF, mainly in the Australian Army Nursing Service. In addition, {{a number of other}} specialist units were also raised, including tunnelling companies, motor transport units, railway, ordnance, workshops and service units, and hospitals and other specialist medical and dental units. One small armoured unit was also raised.|$|E

5|$|Hemilepistus reaumuri is an {{important}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> ecosystem. It has been found at population densities of up to 480,000 individuals per hectare, which is equivalent to a biomass of 19.2kg/ha; in comparison, desert mammals are estimated to have a combined biomass of 39.9kg/ha. The main predator of H. reaumuri is the scorpion Scorpio maurus, and it may compose up to 70% of the scorpion's diet. It appears to be vulnerable to attack only on the surface; no predators are known to attack H. reaumuri in its underground burrows.|$|E
