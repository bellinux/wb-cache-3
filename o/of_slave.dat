5|$|The Jägerstab was {{instrumental}} in bringing about the increased exploitation <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> labour {{for the benefit of}} Germany's war industry and its air force, the Luftwaffe. The task force immediately began implementing plans to expand the use <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> labour in the aviation manufacturing. Records show that SS provided 64,000 prisoners for 20 separate projects at the peak of Jägerstab's construction activities. Taking into account the high mortality rate associated with the underground construction projects, the historian Marc Buggeln estimates that the workforce involved amounted to 80,000−90,000 inmates. They belonged to the various sub-camps of Mittelbau-Dora, Mauthausen-Gusen, Buchenwald and other camps. The prisoners worked for Junkers, Messerschmitt, Henschel and BMW, among others.|$|E
5|$|Although {{signed by}} Pierce and Santa Anna, the treaty needed a 2/3 {{vote in favor}} of {{ratification}} in the US Senate, where it met strong opposition. Antislavery senators opposed further acquisition <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> territory. Lobbying by speculators gave the treaty a bad reputation. Some senators objected to furnishing Santa Anna financial assistance.|$|E
25|$|From {{the colonial}} period until the first {{independent}} decades, Rio de Janeiro was a city <b>of</b> <b>slaves.</b> There was a large influx <b>of</b> African <b>slaves</b> to Rio de Janeiro: in 1819, there were 145,000 slaves in the captaincy. In 1840, the number <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> reached 220,000 people. The Port of Rio de Janeiro was the largest port <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> in America.|$|R

5|$|As {{the river}} {{frontage}} areas of Alabama and Mississippi were settled by planters {{who developed the}} cotton plantation economy with the use <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> labor, Mobile's population exploded. It came to be settled by attorneys, cotton factors, doctors, merchants and other professionals seeking to capitalize on trade with the upriver areas.

We use a new data set {{to explore the}} direct effect on the price <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> that resulted from legislation prohibiting the importation <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> after January 1, 1808. Prohibition of the importation <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> increases the average price <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> as one would anticipate. Moreover, {{we find that the}} price <b>of</b> a female <b>slave</b> <b>of</b> childbearing age increases more than the price for older female <b>slaves.</b> The price <b>of</b> adolescent female <b>slaves,</b> ages 10 to 14, increased more than the price of an adult male slave {{as a result of the}} ban on importation <b>of</b> <b>slaves.</b> We also assess the impact of the embargo of 1807 and the ensuing War of 1812 on the price <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> as the intensive factor input in the production of cotton, rice and tobacco, goods that were severely impacted by the reduction of exports to Britain and continental Europe during this period.

25|$|Controlling for inflation, prices <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> rose {{dramatically}} in the six decades prior to Civil War, reflecting demand due to commodity cotton, as well as use <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> in shipping and industry. Although the prices <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> relative to indentured servants declined, both got more expensive. Cotton production was rising and relied on the use <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> to yield high profits. Fogel and Engeman initially argued that if the Civil War had not happened, the slave prices would have increased even more, an average of more than 50 percent by 1890.|$|R
5|$|Auschwitz was {{considered}} a comfortable posting by many SS members, due to its many amenities and the abundance <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> labor. Of the various prisoner groups, SS officers preferred Jehovah's Witnesses for household slaves because of their nonviolent behavior. Höss lived {{with his wife and}} children in a villa just outside the camp grounds. Other SS personnel were also initially allowed to bring fiancees, wives, and children to live at the camp, but when the SS camp grew more crowded, Höss restricted further arrivals. Facilities for the SS personnel and their families included a library, swimming pool, coffee house, and a theater that hosted regular performances.|$|E
5|$|Clark helped {{organize}} the Whig Party in Kentucky, and as a reward, he {{was chosen as the}} party's nominee for governor in 1836. He won the canvass, defeating Democrat Matthew Flournoy 38,587 to 30,491. In his first address to the legislature, he outlined an ambitious agenda of reforms, including the establishing a public school system, strengthening the office of state auditor, and combating an increase in crime. Believing that banks should be held to their responsibilities, he insisted that the state banks not suspend specie payments. He also strongly believed in the rights <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> owners, and encouraged Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to cooperate in returning escaped slaves.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} parts of Latin America, slavery played a much lesser role in the {{development}} of the Argentine economy, mostly because of the absence of gold mines and sugar plantations, which would have demanded huge numbers <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> workers. Colonial Brazil, for example, imported as many as 2.5 million Africans in the 18th century. By contrast, an estimated 100,000 African slaves arrived at the port of Buenos Aires in the 17th and 18th centuries, and many were destined for Paraguay, Chile and Bolivia.|$|E

Later, the General Assembly chose Dixon to fill the unexpired Senate term of Henry Clay. He served from September 1, 1852, to March 3, 1855, and did not stand for re-election. During his short tenure, Dixon's major accomplishment was convincing Stephen Douglas to include language in the Kansas-Nebraska Act that explicitly repealed the Missouri Compromise's prohibition on slavery north of latitude 36°30'.|$|E
5|$|Following {{accusations of}} forced labour {{on the large}} American-owned Firestone rubber {{plantation}} and American accusations <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> trading, the Liberian government asked the League to launch an investigation. The resulting commission was jointly appointed by the League, the United States, and Liberia. In 1930, a League report confirmed the presence of slavery and forced labour. The report implicated many government officials in the selling of contract labour and recommended that they be replaced by Europeans or Americans, which generated anger within Liberia {{and led to the}} resignation of President Charles D. B. King and his vice-president. The Liberian government outlawed forced labour and slavery and asked for American help in social reforms.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2005 {{purchase}} of the original Colross site by a real estate development company, an archaeological excavation was undertaken between March and June that year {{at the behest of}} the city of Alexandria.

The excavation of the Colross site resulted in 79 condominium buyers abandoning their purchase agreements because of the delay in construction of a luxury Monarch Condominium project.|$|E
50|$|Further, the {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> across regions was not homogenous. In the southeast, the proportion was quite high (especially in the oases). Some villages contained {{a clear majority}} <b>of</b> <b>slaves,</b> like those {{to the south of}} Gabès. At Tunis, despite continuous supply, the group likely remained a minority of the population, not exceeding a few thousand. The areas <b>of</b> concentration <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> were thus spread between Tunis, the Sahel and the southeast.|$|R
50|$|The chief {{concern of}} the article is the {{representation}} <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> in relation to taxation and representation.

5|$|Stolen Childhood: Slave Youth in Nineteenth-Century America is a 1995 {{history book}} about nineteenth century slave {{children}} in America by Wilma King. As the first full-length {{book on the}} subject, it began the scholarship <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> childhood. The book uses historical documents to argue that enslaved children were deprived of experiences now understood to constitute childhood, due to early work responsibilities, frequent bodily and emotional trauma, and separations from family. The book covers themes of the children's education, leisure, religion, transitions to freedmen, and work expectations. It {{was published in the}} Indiana University Press's Blacks in the Diaspora series, and a revised edition was released in 2011.|$|E

He then captained the merchantman Émilie, on which he engaged in commerce raiding despite lacking a letter of marque. He preyed on British shipping, capturing the East Indiaman Triton, before returning to Île de France in the Indian Ocean, where his prizes were confiscated. He then returned to France, where he obtained prize money from the government.|$|E
