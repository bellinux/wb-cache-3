40|$|We present new {{hash tables}} for joins, and a hash join based on them, that consumes far less memory {{and is usually}} faster than {{recently}} published in-memory joins. Our hash join is not restricted to <b>outer</b> <b>tables</b> that fit wholly in memory. Key to this hash join is a new concise hash table (CHT), a linear probing hash table that has 100 % fill factor, and uses a sparse bitmap with embedded population counts to almost entirely avoid collisions. This bitmap {{also serves as a}} Bloom filter for use in multi-table joins. We study the random access characteristics of hash joins, and renew the case for non-partitioned hash joins. We intro-duce a variant of partitioned joins in which only the build is partitioned, but the probe is not, as this is more efficient for large <b>outer</b> <b>tables</b> than traditional partitioned joins. This also avoids partitioning costs during the probe, {{while at the same time}} allowing parallel build without latching overheads. Additionally, we present a variant of CHT, called a concise array table (CAT), that can be used when the key domain is moderately dense. CAT is collision-free and avoids storing join keys in the hash table. We perform a detailed comparison of CHT and CAT against leading in-memory hash joins. Our experiments show that we can reduce the memory usage by one to three orders of magnitude, while also being competitive in performance. 1...|$|R

50|$|The five {{layers of}} the scalp, from {{superficial}} to deep, can be easily memorized by using the mnemonic SCALP. The Skin of the scalp is the thickest of the human body, measuring up to 8 mm in thickness and contains approximately 100.000 hairs. Hair lines make scalp reconstruction difficult because the hair lines have to be respected to get a satisfying aesthetic result.The subCutis is a layer of fat, enclosed in compartments formed by rigid fibrous septa. Their inelasticy prevents bleeding vessels to collapse and retract under the skin to achieve haemostasis. All large blood vessels and nerves of the scalp are located in this layer.The next layer is the galea Aponeurotica, which separates the underlying bone and the overlying layers. The large blood vessels and nerves of the scalp don’t pierce this layer.Loose connective tissue between the periostium and the aponeurosis makes these two rigid structures easily slide over each other and contributes to skin movement. Thus, if vascular and nervous anatomy is respected, the skin, sucutaneous tissue and galea aponeurotica can be lifted off the skull with minimal bleeding, nerve damage, or chance of necrosis. This method was first described by Orticochea in 1967, but has been updated to minimize scarring.The fifth layer is the Periosteum of the skull, {{also referred to as}} pericranium. It can be separated from the skull, except near the sutures. The skull consists of an inner and <b>outer</b> <b>table,</b> with spongy bone in between known as diploë.|$|E
50|$|Major {{findings}} regarding the two missile wounds: Skull: There are multiple fractures {{of the bones}} of the calvarium bilaterally. These fractures extend into the base of the skull and involve the floor of the anterior fossa on the right side as well as the middle fossa in the midline. With respect to the right frontoparietal region of the skull, the traumatic damage is particularly severe with extensive fragmentation of the bony structures from the midline of the frontal bone anteriorly to the vicinity of the posterior margin of the parietal bone behind. Above, the fragmentation extends approximately 25 mm across the midline to involve adjacent portions of the left parietal bone; below, the changes extend into the right temporal bone. Throughout this region, many of the bony pieces have been displaced outward; several pieces are missing. Distributed through the right cerebral hemisphere are numerous small, irregular metallic fragments most of which are less than 1 mm in maximum dimension.The majority of these fragments lie anteriorly and superiorly. None can be visualized {{on the left side of}} the brain and none below a horizontal plane through the floor of the anterior fossa of the skull. On one of the lateral films of the skull (#2), a hole measuring approximately 8 mm in diameter on the outer surface of the skull and as much as 20 mm on the internal surface can be seen in profile approximately 100 mm above the external occipital protuberance. The bone of the lower edge of the hole is depressed. Also, there is, embedded in the <b>outer</b> <b>table</b> of the skull close to the lower edge of the hole, a large metallic fragment which on the anteroposterior film (#1) lies 25 mm to the right of the midline. This fragment as seen in the latter film is round and measures 6.5 mm in diameter immediately adjacent to the hole on the internal surface of the skull, there is localized elevation of the soft tissues. Small fragments of bone lie within portions of these tissues and within the hole itself. These changes are consistent with an entrance wound of the skull produced by a bullet similar to that of exhibit CE 399. The metallic fragments visualized within the right cerebral hemisphere fall into two groups. One group consists of relatively large fragments, more or less randomly distributed. The second group consists of finely divided fragments, distributed in a posteroanterior direction in a region 45 mm long and 8& mm wide.As seen on lateral film #2, this formation overlies the position of the coronal suture; its long axis, if extended posteriorly, passes through the above-mentioned hole. It appears to end anteriorly immediately below the badly fragmented frontal and parietal bones just anterior to the region of the coronal suture. The foregoing observations indicate that the decedent's head was struck from behind by a single projectile. It entered the occipital region 25 mm to the right of the midline and 100 mm above the external occipital protuberance. The projectile fragmented on entering the skull, one major section leaving a trail of fine metallic debris as it passed forward and laterally to explosively fracture the right frontal and parietal bones as it emerged from the head. In addition to the foregoing, it is noteworthy that there is no evidence of projectile fragments in the left cerebral tissues or in the right cerebral hemisphere below a horizontal plane passing through the floor of the anterior fossa of the skull.Also, although the fractures of the calvarium extend to the left of the midline and into the anterior and middle fossa of the skull, no bony defect, such as one created by a projectile either entering or leaving the head, is seen in the calvarium to the left of the midline or in the base of the skull. Hence, it is not reasonable to postulate that a projectile passed through the head in a direction other than that described above. Of further note, when the X-ray films of the skull were presented to The Panel, film #1 had been damaged in two small regions by what appears to be the heat from a spotlight. Also, on film #2, a pair of converging pencil lines had been drawn on the film. Neither of these artifacts interfered with the interpretation of the films.|$|E

40|$|Background: The authors {{investigated}} the long-term outcome of frozen autologous bone cranioplasty {{in patients who}} had undergone decompressive craniectomy for severe traumatic brain injury. Methods: A retrospective analysis was undertaken of all patients who had undergone decompressive craniectomy at the two major trauma hospitals in Western Australia between 2004 and 2010. A specific note was made regarding "failure" of frozen autologous bone because of either infection or bone flap resorption. Results: A total of 194 patients required either unilateral or bilateral decompressive craniectomy for severe traumatic brain injury during the study period. Of these patients, 156 had had an autologous cranioplasty. Among these patients, the cranioplasty was judged a failure in 45 (29 percent). Thirteen (8. 5 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 5. 0 to 14. 0 percent) developed an infection requiring removal of the cranioplasty. Thirty-two (21 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 15 to 28 percent) developed clinical symptoms or signs relating to resorption of the cranioplasty. Fourteen (9 percent) required secondary titanium cranioplasty, two were offered surgical augmentation but declined, and 16 (10 percent) developed significant bone resorption through both the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>tables</b> of the skull. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated {{that the use of}} frozen autologous bone is associated with a high long-term failure rate; however, this does not necessarily imply that alternative materials should be routinely used. Although a number are available, their efficacy over and above frozen autologous bone remains to be established and perhaps this will only be demonstrated in the setting of a formal clinical trial...|$|R

On the other hand, bleeding from the edge of the sac was not so heavy, suggesting that main feedings no longer remained. The edge was then ligated and the scalp was closed in layers.|$|E
40|$|The {{calvarium}} encasing {{the brain}} parenchyma is {{formed by the}} frontal, parietal, and occipital bones, {{as well as a}} small portion formed by the temporal bones.

Slow-growing tumors lead to thinning in the neighboring calvarium, whereas aggressive tumors lead to dramatic destruction.

The large funerary structure, which contained the skeletal remains of 24 individuals, is dated back to the 13 th century. A skull, belonging to an adult male, was found among the skeletal remains showing evidences of two head lesions produced by bladed instruments. The first consists in a linear wound that involved only the <b>outer</b> cranial <b>table</b> of parietal bones; bone remodeling indicates that the individual survived the injury for a long time. The second {{is located on the}} right portion of the frontal squama and involves all the thickness of the bone with clean and well-defined margins; the absence of any traces of reparative processes and signs of healing allows a diagnosis of peri mortem lesion. Only the triangular extremities of this injury can be recognized because the central portion of the wound is obliterated by an oval bone loss, 3 x 2 cm, characterized by clean cutting-edges along the <b>outer</b> cranial <b>table,</b> whereas the margins of the inner cranial table are irregulars. In order to treat this lesion, the patient was submitted to a surgical intervention, probably performed to clean the wound and remove any bone splinters. Trepanation performed to treat cranial traumas was described in detail by several medical classic and medieval Authors, whose texts were available in the 13 th century. In particular, the surgeon from Poggibonsi had access to the medical literature and he probably followed the prescriptions of the surgical texts, such as that of Albucasis, {{which was one of the}} most famous during the Middle Ages.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONThe desmoplastic fibroma {{is a rare}} locally {{invasive}} bone tumour. Surgical resection {{with minimal}} margins is recommended. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 15 year-old boy was referred with chronic left thigh pain. MRI revealed a bone lesion within the cavity of the inner table of the left iliac wing without invasion of the underlying bone marrow. A surgical biopsy revealed a desmoplastic bone fibroma. A partial resection of the inner table of the iliac wing sparing the <b>outer</b> <b>table</b> was performed. At the latest follow-up the initially spared iliac wing had needed further resection. The reason proposed for this is devascularisation by substantial periosteal stripping causing partial resorption initially, then necrosis and ultimately ulceration through the skin necessitating further surgical resection. DISCUSSIONThe technique of resection of a pelvic desmoplastic fibroma sparing the <b>outer</b> <b>table</b> of the iliac wing has not previously been reported. The objective of a limited resection was {{to minimize the risk}} of a postsurgical limp caused by weakness of the gluteus medius muscle. However we report that this technique did not work in this case. A wider resection of the iliac wing as it is recommended for a malignant tumour would have yielded a similar final outcome. CONCLUSIONA partial resection of the iliac wing seemed an appealing technique for a benign tumour of the inner table of the iliac wing. However, considering the complications encountered, the authors advise a simple “en bloc” resection of the iliac wing for this type of tumour in this location...|$|E
