50|$|The typical German Jubilate reed {{configuration}} in Pakistani Qawwali harmoniums is one bank of Bass (16') reeds and {{a bank of}} Male (8') reeds (octaves apart) {{that sound}} together on one note being played with an engaged (most often permanently) right action <b>octave</b> <b>coupler</b> (a mechanism located under the keyboard that simultaneously couples and plays the same note/key an octave higher with the lower note or notes being played on the harmonium to create a strong and full sound). Often the lowest octave of German Bass reeds is not available and is therefore substituted with Indian Delhi style brass reeds.|$|E
5|$|In addition, larger organs may use unison off couplers, {{which prevent}} the stops pulled in a {{particular}} division from sounding at their normal pitch. These {{can be used in}} combination with <b>octave</b> <b>couplers</b> to create innovative aural effects, and {{can also be used to}} rearrange the order of the manuals to make specific pieces easier to play.|$|R
5|$|<b>Octave</b> <b>couplers,</b> which add {{the pipes}} an octave above (super-octave) or below (sub-octave) each note that is played, may operate on one {{division}} only (for example, the Swell super octave, which adds the octave above {{what is being}} played on the Swell to itself), or act as a coupler to another keyboard (for example, the Swell super-octave to Great, which adds to the Great manual {{the ranks of the}} Swell division an octave above what is being played).|$|R
25|$|The mid 70s saw {{changes to}} the interior. The Lady chapel altar was removed, and the organ was moved from its {{location}} in the south transept to a purpose built gallery {{at the rear of}} the church. Regrettably rather than extend the tonal range of the instrument, electric action allowed <b>octave</b> <b>couplers,</b> and some of the original stops were renamed but not revoiced. The instrument supports congregational singing, but is no longer useful for accompanying choral works.|$|R

500|$|Between 2006–2008 Sydney firm [...] "John W Parker – Pipe Organ Builders" [...] {{refurbished}} the organ, {{returning the}} soundboard action to electric, providing a new roll-top 'detached' console, and {{an entirely new}} wind supply and bellows. The swell box which had been discarded in the 1975 rebuild was reinstated, and the pedal Bourdon 16' stop was extended to 8' pitch. <b>Octave</b> <b>couplers</b> were provided in Sub and Octave pitches on the Swell also. All manual pipework was washed, cleaned and regulated to original Hill standards and tonality.|$|R
50|$|Reed {{organs and}} {{harmoniums}} {{of the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries often had a similar mechanism to a crescendo pedal. Since the player's feet were needed to pedal the bellows that provided the wind for the instrument, the mechanism was operated by a 'paddle' lever moved {{by one of the}} player's knees (the paddle being located under the keyboard). Usually this was called a 'full organ pedal', as it did not gradually engage ranks of stops {{in the manner of a}} true crescendo pedal, but simply engaged all the stops (and usually any <b>octave</b> <b>couplers</b> fitted to the instrument) when operated, with no progressive action.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Strip line {{version is}} the {{microwave}} integrated {{version of the}} microwave device that attracts towards miniaturization of the device without loosing {{the performance of the}} actual device. Compactness, lightweight, low loss, low cost, reproducibility and easy fabrication are the features of the miniaturized circuit. Design, fabrication of a 20 dB coupler operating from 2 GHz to 8 GHz is carried out according to the procedure outlined The fabricated coupler is tested and results found to be encouraging. Also, the design and development of the multi <b>octave</b> bandwidth <b>coupler</b> operating from 6 - 18 GHz and for a coupling value of 6 dB is carried out. For the design of this coupler, the offset parallel configuration is used. In this, the circuit is {{on both sides of the}} RT- Duriod of thickness of 5 mil. The coupler has been fabricated and tested with Network Analyzer test setup. The basic parameters of the couplers i. e. Coupling, Return loss etc are measured. The experimental results are in close agreement with the theoretical predictions. A 20 dB directional coupler finds a variety of other applications i. e. power monitoring, reflectometer, power divider, in radar systems, for the measurement of frequency etc in RF and microwave communications where as a 3 dB coupler may be used for power-monitoring device in antenna application...|$|R
