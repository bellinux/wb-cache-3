5000|$|Stubs may be {{lengthened}} {{in order}} to change from an <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> to a short circuit stub and vice versa. [...] Low-pass filters usually consist of series inductors and shunt capacitors. Applying Kuroda's identities will convert these to all shunt capacitors, which are <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> stubs. <b>Open</b> <b>circuit</b> stubs are preferred in printed technologies because they are easier to implement, {{and this is the}} technology likely to be found in consumer products. However, {{this is not the case}} in other technologies such as coaxial line, or twin-lead where the short circuit may actually be helpful for mechanical support of the structure. Short circuits also have a small advantage in that they are generally have a more precise position than <b>open</b> <b>circuits.</b> If the circuit is to be further transformed into the waveguide medium then <b>open</b> <b>circuits</b> are out of the question because there would be radiation out of the aperture so formed. For a high-pass filter the inverse applies, applying Kuroda will naturally result in short circuit stubs and it may be desirable for a printed design to convert to <b>open</b> <b>circuits.</b> As an example, a λ/8 <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> stub can be replaced with a 3λ/8 short circuit stub of the same characteristic impedance without changing the circuit functionally.|$|R

25|$|In rebreather diving, bailout to <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> is a {{procedure}} where the diver switches from breathing from the rebreather loop to <b>open</b> <b>circuit.</b> This is done when the loop is compromised for any reason, {{and is often}} done temporarily when there is some doubt that the gas in the loop is right for the depth. Bailout to <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> may be a local switch-over at the bailout valve (BOV) to breathe gas directly from the diluent cylinder, or may be a switch to off-board gas, which is carried in an independent cylinder and is directly equivalent to <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> bailout. This may be done through an off-board supply connected to the BOV or through a regular fully independent bailout set carried for the purpose.

50|$|A bailout valve is an <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> {{demand valve}} fitted to the {{mouthpiece}} of a rebreather with a manually operated mechanism {{to switch from}} closed <b>circuit</b> to <b>open</b> <b>circuit.</b> The position selecting the <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> demand valve may substitute for the closed state of a dive-surface valve (DSV) as the breathing loop is effectively sealed when on bailout. A bailout valve allows the diver to switch from closed <b>circuit</b> to <b>open</b> <b>circuit</b> without the need to change mouthpieces.
