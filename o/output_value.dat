25|$|The {{fragment}} processor cannot {{perform a}} direct scatter operation because {{the location of}} each fragment on the grid is fixed {{at the time of}} the fragment's creation and cannot be altered by the programmer. However, a logical scatter operation may sometimes be recast or implemented with another gather step. A scatter implementation would first emit both an <b>output</b> <b>value</b> and an output address. An immediately following gather operation uses address comparisons to see whether the <b>output</b> <b>value</b> maps to the current output slot.|$|E

40|$|A circuit {{may produce}} unknown <b>output</b> <b>values</b> during {{simulation}} of an input sequence {{due to an}} unknown initial state or due {{to the existence of}} tri-state elements. For circuits tested using BIST, unknown <b>output</b> <b>values</b> make it impossible to determine a single unique signature for the fault free circuit. To accommodate unknown <b>output</b> <b>values</b> in a BIST scheme, we describe a procedure for synthesizing a minimal logic block that replaces unknown <b>output</b> <b>values</b> by a known constant. The proposed procedure ensures that the BIST scheme will be able to detect all the faults detectable by the input sequence applied to the circuit while allowing a single unique signature to be obtained...|$|R

25|$|A {{function}} can {{be defined}} by any mathematical condition relating each argument (input value) to the corresponding <b>output</b> <b>value.</b> If the domain is finite, a function f may be defined by simply tabulating all the arguments x and their corresponding function values f(x).

To achieve code that computes not only the <b>output</b> <b>values</b> simultaneously but also the derivative values, this work introduces several source-to-source transformation rules.

While the “nonuniform” operator (Eq. 1) produces 2 P different <b>output</b> <b>values,</b> the uniform operator produces only P+ 2 distinct <b>output</b> <b>values,</b> and the “rotation invariant” operator produces P(P− 1)+ 2 points.|$|R
25|$|Fuzzy {{controllers}} {{are very}} simple conceptually. They consist of an input stage, a processing stage, and an output stage. The input stage maps sensor or other inputs, such as switches, thumbwheels, and so on, {{to the appropriate}} membership functions and truth values. The processing stage invokes each appropriate rule and generates a result for each, then combines {{the results of the}} rules. Finally, the output stage converts the combined result back into a specific control <b>output</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} Boolean {{results are}} transferred from a truth table onto a two-dimensional grid where, in Karnaugh maps, the cells are ordered in Gray code, and each cell position represents one combination of input conditions, while each cell value represents the corresponding <b>output</b> <b>value.</b> Optimal groups of 1s or 0s are identified, which represent {{the terms of}} a canonical form of the logic in the original truth table. These terms can be used to write a minimal Boolean expression representing the required logic.|$|E
25|$|This {{is useful}} in {{computer}} science since most data structures have members with 2X possible values. For example, a byte has 256 (28) possible values (0–255). Therefore, to fill a byte or bytes with random values a random number generator which produces values 1–256 can be used, the byte taking the <b>output</b> <b>value</b> −nbsp&1. Very large Fermat primes are of particular interest in data encryption for this reason. This method produces only pseudorandom values as, after Pnbsp&−nbsp&1 repetitions, the sequence repeats. A poorly chosen multiplier can result in the sequence repeating sooner than Pnbsp&−nbsp&1.|$|E

Another 25% of the output by value comes from offshore oil and gas resources. India operated about 3,000 mines in 2010, half of which were coal, limestone and iron ore. On output-value basis, India {{was one of the}} five largest producers of mica, chromite, coal, lignite, iron ore, bauxite, barites, zinc and manganese; while being one of the ten largest global producers of many other minerals. India was the fourth-largest producer of steel in 2013, and the seventh-largest producer of aluminium.|$|E
25|$|In this example, two {{variables}} {{that will be}} maintained within the loop are initialized to zero, then the loop begins. The current error is calculated by subtracting the measured_value (the process variable or PV) from the current setpoint (SP). Then, integral and derivative values are calculated and these and the error are combined with three preset gain terms – the proportional gain, the integral gain and the derivative gain – to derive an <b>output</b> <b>value.</b> In the real world, this is D-to-A converted and passed into the process under control as the manipulated variable (or MV). The current error is stored elsewhere for re-use in the next differentiation, the program then waits until dt seconds have passed since start, and the loop begins again, reading in new values for the PV and the setpoint and calculating a new value for the error.|$|E

This reduction is apparently good for economy since it could reduce unnecessary cost resources.

This paper develops an advanced radial DEA model dealing with mixed integer linear programming to improve integer <b>output</b> <b>values</b> through the combination of inputs.
