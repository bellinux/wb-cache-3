5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Potter sketched the {{interior}} of the third Lakefield Cottage belonging to a Mrs. Lord. These drawings included a watercolour and pen-and-ink sketches of the living-room, pen-and-ink sketches of the pots of geraniums on the living-room window sill, the entrance passage, the pantry, the stairs, some of the upstairs rooms, and details of the carved oak furniture. In some of the sketches Potter roughly outlined a cat. She also sketched the village including the sloping path down to the Lakefield Cottages and the post <b>office</b> <b>door.</b> These became the backgrounds for The Pie and The Patty-Pan.|$|E

Liz reminds Jack that Mother's Day is coming up, prompting Jack to realize he forgot to send his mother Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch) flowers and informs his office assistant Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) to send her flowers, however, Colleen is waiting outside Jack's <b>office</b> <b>door.</b> Colleen's real reason for visiting her son is that she learned from her friend in Florida that Jack is dating Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), a recent divorcée, {{and a woman who}} happens to be Jack's high school sweetheart. During dinner, Colleen does not bring Nancy up, but tells Jack she knows about his involvement with CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) after an awkward encounter between Avery and Jack in an elevator with Colleen present; because of the encounter, Colleen knows that Avery and Jack are sleeping together. Colleen is appalled that Jack is dating two women at the same time, and demands that he end it and make a choice between Nancy and Avery.|$|E

25|$|In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, {{the real}} Moody {{has joined the}} newly re-formed Order, and leads the party {{transferring}} Harry from 4 Privet Drive to Number 12 Grimmauld Place. He appears at the climax of that book, arriving to the battle at the Department of Mysteries after being tipped off by Snape. He also appears with Lupin and Tonks at the very end, when they give the Dursleys a warning concerning their treatment of Harry. Moody only features briefly in Half-Blood Prince. In Deathly Hallows he is killed by Voldemort after being abandoned by Mundungus Fletcher, who was acting as a Potter decoy. The Order is unable to recover his body; but later his magical eye is found by Harry mounted on Dolores Umbridge's <b>office</b> <b>door</b> to spy on Ministry of Magic employees.

40|$|<b>Office</b> <b>doors</b> {{are more}} than entrances to rooms, they are entrances to a person's time and attention. People can mediate access to {{themselves}} by choosing whether to leave their door open or closed {{when they are in}} their <b>office.</b> <b>Doors</b> also serve as a medium for communication, where people can broadcast individual messages to passersby, or accept messages from others who stopped by when the door was closed. These qualities make the door an excellent location for designing solutions that help people better manage their time and attention. In this paper, we present a study of doors, derive design insights from the study, and then realize some of these insights in two cooperating implementations deployed in our workplace.

40|$|Door {{detection}} {{by using}} wearable cameras helps {{people with severe}} vision impairment to independently access un-known environments. The goal {{of this paper is}} to robustly detect different doors and classify them as <b>office</b> <b>doors,</b> el-evators, exits, etc. These tasks are challenging due to the factors: 1) small inter-class variations of different objects such as <b>office</b> <b>doors</b> and elevators, 2) only part of an object is captured due to occlusions or continuous camera mov-ing of a mobile system. To overcome the above challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Compositional Model (HCM) approach which incorporates context information into the model decomposition process of a part-based HCM to han-dle partially captured objects as well as large intra-class variations in different environments. Our preliminary ex-perimental results demonstrate promising performance on doors detection over a wide range of scales, view points, and occlusions. 1...|$|R
