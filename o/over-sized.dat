5|$|Since the 1980s, several parties, {{including}} the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), the British Heart Foundation, the City of New York, and the Spanish government, {{have argued that}} Burger King has contributed to obesity and unhealthy eating behaviors in Western nations by producing products that contain large amounts of salt, fat, trans-fat and calories. After its purchase by TPG Capital from former parent company Diageo in 2002, the company introduced several large, <b>over-sized</b> products including its European BK XXL line, the British Angus burger six-pack, the Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line. These new offerings, and others like them, have resulted in further international scorn and negative attention due the large portion size and increased amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats in these items. Many consumer groups have accused Burger King and other fast food restaurant chains of failing to provide healthier alternatives.|$|E
25|$|The {{electorate}} rose through house-building from {{a relatively}} modest 37,051 in 1918 to an <b>over-sized</b> (malapportioned) 95,227 in 1945.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, pop rappers such as The Fresh Prince, Kid 'n Play, and Left Eye of TLC popularized {{baseball}} caps and bright, often neon-colored, clothing. TLC and late R singer Aaliyah created a fashion trend among women. Wearing <b>over-sized</b> pants and big flannel shirts, they would couple the <b>over-sized</b> clothing {{with a tight}} shirt usually a sports bra underneath their big shirts. This was to show {{their own version of}} femininity, everything {{does not have to be}} form fitting and tight in order to be sexy.|$|E
25|$|The hotel's Main Lobby was {{dramatic}} and opulent with {{green and gold}} decorations, carrying the theme through its carpets and drapes. It was furbished with marble throughout: floors, statues and a desk. Accents included brass fixtures and spittoons. There were <b>over-sized,</b> upholstered chairs, as well as shorter ones for women and children.|$|E
25|$|The renewed industrialization, which based {{itself on}} both a dogmatic {{understanding}} of Marxian economics {{and a series}} of autarkic goals, brought major economic problems to Romania, beginning with the effects of the 1973 oil crisis, and worsened by the 1979 energy crisis. The profound neglect of services and decline in quality of life, first manifested when much of the budget was diverted to support an <b>over-sized</b> industry, was made more drastic by the political decision to pay in full the country's external debt (in 1983, this was set at 10billion United States dollars, of which 4.5 was accumulated interest). By March 1989, the debt had been paid in full.|$|E
25|$|Membrane {{dry suits}} {{are made from}} thin {{materials}} which have little thermal insulation. They are commonly made of stockinette fabric coated with vulcanized rubber, laminated layers of nylon and butyl rubber known as Trilaminate or Cordura proofed with an inner layer of polyurethane. With {{the exception of the}} rubber-coated stockinette, membrane dry suits typically do not stretch, so they need to be made slightly <b>over-sized</b> and baggy to allow flexibility at the joints through the wearer's range of motion and to allow the hands and feet to pass through without difficulty. This makes membrane dry suits easy to put on and take off, provides a good range of motion for the wearer when correctly sized and sufficiently inflated, and makes them relatively comfortable to wear for long periods out of the water compared to a wetsuit or close-fitting neoprene dry suit, as the wearer does not have to pull against rubber elasticity to move or keep joints flexed.|$|E
25|$|The Ulysses mosaic {{is a work}} {{inspired}} by the Odyssey: the Greek hero is seen standing on a boat that is decorated with a human head and a palm branch and that has two sails and a battering ram. Ulysses’s hands {{are tied to the}} main mast so that he will not succumb to the fatal charm of the sirens’ music. Ulysses’s companions are seated around him, their ears blocked with wax as described in the legend. Three sirens stand {{at the base of a}} rocky crag. They are depicted with the bust of a woman, but with the wings and legs of a bird. One of them holds a flute, the second a lyre, while the third, who does not carry an instrument, is believed to be the singing siren. In front of Ulysses’s boat, there is a small barque with a fisherman holding a lobster, the depiction of which is <b>over-sized.</b> The mosaic has been dated to around 260-268 CE; it was discovered in the “house of Ulysses and the pirates”.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} changes was the decision to bore out the <b>over-sized</b> 40.6cm guns to 42cm caliber for the H-41 design. The design staff determined that modifications to the ammunition hoists and loading equipment would be easily effected and that the original turrets could be retained. The OKM was aware that the British had settled on a 40.6cm gun for the proposed the 42cm gun would grant the H-41 design a significant advantage over these new adversaries. The ships' armament was otherwise unchanged, apart from an increased number of 2cm anti-aircraft guns, of which there were now to be 34.|$|E
500|$|According to Tite Kubo, Zombiepowder. {{originated}} as an {{idea for}} a samurai manga which would have been titled [...] "Samurai Drive." [...] This initial conception of the story had very little in common with the end product, as it did not feature western elements or the titular zombie powder. It did star a version of Gamma, however, who still bore an <b>over-sized</b> sword and bounty, and featured scifi technologies. With respect to the premise of Zombiepowder., the author stated that the theme was fighting, and a world where the hope for resurrection lay not in god, but obtaining a mysterious substance. Tite Kubo did not comment on his influences for the series, but critic Theron Martin believed its tone, setting, and style drew heavily on the cyberpunk manga Battle Angel Alita, the dark fantasy manga Berserk, and fellow sci-fi/western manga Trigun, and A.E. Sparrow of IGN noted the obligatory genre influence of martial arts anime Dragon Ball Z. The series also borrows terminology from the music industry, referring to each chapter as a track, the bonus omake content in each volume as B-Sides, and naming primary character Elwood after a record label founder.|$|E
500|$|On Day 1, the {{original}} twelve HouseGuests entered the house. Following introductions, the HouseGuests {{learned of the}} season's twist, {{in which they would}} be playing as members of common high school cliques. Despite this, HouseGuests continued to play the game as individuals and competed in competitions as individuals, were nominated as individuals, and were evicted as individuals. They also learned that if a member of their clique won Head of Household, they could not be nominated for eviction. Upon entering the backyard to compete in their first Head of Household competition, the HouseGuests learned what cliques they would be playing as. HouseGuests Jeff, Natalie, and Russell were in the Athletes clique, while Chima, Michele, and Ronnie were in the Brains clique. Casey, Kevin, and Lydia were placed in the Offbeat clique, leaving Braden, Jordan, and Laura in the Popular clique. Following this, HouseGuests competed in [...] "The Wedgie" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests wore a pair of <b>over-sized</b> underwear and held onto a toilet seat while being suspended in air by the underwear. The last HouseGuest remaining in the air would earn a fourth member to their clique, with this member becoming the first Head of Household of the season. The four eligible HouseGuests to enter the game were former HouseGuests Michael [...] "Cowboy" [...] Ellis for the Offbeat clique, Jessica Hughbanks for the Popular clique, Brian Hart for the Brains clique, and Jessie Godderz for the Athletes clique. Natalie and Russell were the last two HouseGuests remaining, thus earned immunity for their clique and allowed them to earn a fourth clique member; Jessie entered the house as their fourth clique member, and became the first Head of Household of the season. Jessie's entrance to the house brought the total number of HouseGuests to thirteen. In an attempt to keep himself safe, Ronnie and Jessie later formed an alliance between the Brains clique and the Athletes clique. Hoping to hide their alliance, Jessie and Natalie later proposed Ronnie be nominated as a pawn, however, he quickly refused to do so.|$|E
500|$|On Day 4, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Big Brother Rave" [...] Have-Not competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were {{required}} to construct a series of pipes to spell out the word [...] "Have" [...] while neon [...] "Rave Juice" [...] flowed through the piping. If done correctly, the pipes would cause the juice to spill onto a wheel and cause it to spin; the last team {{to complete the task}} would be the Have-Nots for the week. The Brains clique lost the competition, meaning Chima, Michele, and Ronnie were the Have-Nots for the week. This greatly upset Chima, who stated on numerous occasions afterwards that she was debating walking from the game. Jessie took an immediate dislike to Laura, and hoped to put her up, though his clique members attempted to convince him that Lydia should be evicted that week. Due to Ronnie refusing to be nominated as a pawn, Chima later agreed to be nominated as a pawn. On Day 5, Jessie chose to nominate Chima and Lydia for eviction, with Lydia being his target for eviction. Worried they might not have the votes to keep Chima, Jessie and Russell formed an alliance with Laura in attempt to get her to evict Lydia. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Russell, Natalie, and Jeff were selected to compete for the Power of Veto; Casey was selected to host. On Day 7, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Pop Goes the Veto!" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to pop [...] "pimples" [...] on an <b>over-sized</b> face, with various Scrabble tiles inside of them. The HouseGuests would collect tiles and attempt to spell a word with their collected tiles; the HouseGuest with the longest correctly spelled word would win the Power of Veto. Russell was the winner of the Power of Veto. Following the competition, Jeff engaged in numerous arguments with Russell and Natalie, causing a rift in their clique. In an attempt to save herself, Lydia attempted to convince Russell and Jessie to backdoor Braden that week by taking her off the block as a way to hurt Jeff. Russell later told Ronnie that this was the plan, with Ronnie telling Braden, Jeff, and Jordan about the plan. On Day 9, Russell chose to use the Power of Veto to remove Lydia from the block, with Braden being nominated in her place. Following Braden's nomination, Jordan and Laura began campaigning to get the votes for him to stay, and appeared to have themselves, Casey, Jeff, Michele, and Ronnie in agreement; Ronnie, however, was playing both sides and had no intention of keeping Braden in the game. On Day 12, Braden became the first HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when Jessie cast the tie-breaker vote in Chima's favor.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{remarkable}} {{piece of}} orchestral music Ives completed was his [...] "Fourth Symphony". He {{worked on this}} from 1910 to 1916. This symphony is notable for its complexity and <b>over-sized</b> orchestra. It has four movements and a complete performance of it was not given until 1965 (i.e. half a century after it was completed and over a decade after Ives's death).|$|E
2500|$|SlotZilla at Fremont Street Experience is a 12-story, slot machine-inspired zip line attraction. SlotZilla offers [...] "flyers" [...] {{two levels}} of lines, the lower [...] "Zipline" [...] (77 feet up) and upper [...] "Zoomline" [...] (114 feet up). The lower lines travel halfway down the Fremont Street Experience {{pedestrian}} mall. The upper lines go {{the entire length of}} the mall (1,750 feet). Guests on the upper [...] "Zoomline" [...] travel prone, or [...] "superhero-style." [...] SlotZilla cost $17 million to construct and features a launch tower with <b>over-sized</b> dice, a martini glass, a pink flamingo, simulated video reels, a giant arm and two 37-foot-tall showgirls.|$|E
2500|$|Japanese art {{initially}} adapted Chinese {{styles to}} reflect {{their interest in}} narrative themes in art, with scenes set in landscapes mixing with those showing palace or city scenes using the same high view point, cutting away roofs as necessary. [...] These appeared in the very long yamato-e scrolls of scenes illustrating the Tale of Genji and other subjects, mostly from the 12th and 13th centuries. The concept of the gentleman-amateur painter had little resonance in feudal Japan, where artists were generally professionals with a strong bond to their master and his school, rather than the classic artists from the distant past, from which Chinese painters tended to draw their inspiration. Painting was initially fully coloured, often brightly so, and the landscape never overwhelms the figures who are often rather <b>over-sized.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, Matsumoto {{drew his}} first {{full-fledged}} manga, a 16-page story titled [...] Printed as an <b>over-sized</b> pamphlet with a sturdy cardboard cover, and {{included as a}} premium in the April issue of Shōjo no tomo, The Mysterious Clover was a variation on The Scarlet Pimpernel and Zorro. The protagonist of The Mysterious Clover is a young girl who protects the poor peasants from the cruel and greedy nobles. This work is remarkable for its use of varying angles, including bird's-eye views, and variation {{in the size of}} panels. Sakō Shishido (...) , influenced by American newspaper strips, had used similar techniques in his 1930 , but in a far cruder drawing style than Matsumoto's. The Mysterious Clover had been neglected for decades by manga scholars until it was displayed at a 2006 exhibition at the Yayoi Art Museum, where it caught the eye of Fusanosuke Natsume, who then wrote about it on his blog and in a newspaper column.|$|E
2500|$|The Miami-based {{advertising}} firm of Crispin Porter + Bogusky [...] (CP+B) {{took over}} the advertising account of Burger King on January 27, 2003. They began using a caricatured variation of the Burger King character from the Burger King Kingdom advertising campaign, now simply called [...] "the King". An employee at Crispin Porter + Bogusky found a 1970s'-era, oversized King head for sale on eBay; originally used as an inspiration for brainstorming, it was eventually decided to restore the head and {{use it in a}} campaign. This version of the King began appearing in commercials in 2004. Employing the advertising technique called Viral marketing, CP+B's ads generated significant word of mouth for its new use of what various trade publications and Internet articles labeled [...] "the Creepy King" [...] persona, an appellation that BK has come to favor and CP+B uses in its ads. In this incarnation, [...] "the King" [...] is an actor who wears an <b>over-sized,</b> grinning mask that resembles the King. The ads feature the King appearing in various, unexpected places, such as in bed with people or behind doors and walls, only to offer these people some sort of Burger King product.|$|E
2500|$|Following James' eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Glass Houses" [...] {{endurance}} Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were required to hang onto either a bar or rope while hanging inside of a glass box suspended in the air; the last HouseGuest remaining in their box is the winner. Sheila was the winner. During the competition, Sheila promised Natalie safety in exchange for {{dropping out of the}} competition, a deal which she agreed to. Despite this, all of the HouseGuests were united against Natalie that week. On Day 64, Sheila chose to nominate Adam and Sharon for eviction. That night, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "PoTV" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to use remote controls in an attempt to change the channels, thus forming an image on an <b>over-sized</b> television. The HouseGuest to complete the competition in the fastest time would be the winner. Adam was the winner of the Power of Veto. On Day 67, Adam chose to use the Power of Veto to remove himself from the block, with Natalie being nominated in his place. Despite feeling safe, Natalie was later confronted by the other HouseGuests and questioned about her true intentions. Following this, Adam and Ryan {{came up with a plan}} to split the vote, forcing Sheila to cast the deciding vote. On Day 70, Natalie became the twelfth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when Sheila broke a tie in Sharon's favor. She became the fifth member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E
2500|$|On Day 1, Dick, Dustin, and Jessica {{entered the}} house through the Head of Household room before the others arrived. The eleven {{remaining}} HouseGuests then {{entered the house}}, unaware {{of the fact that}} the three were already present. Shortly after entering the house, the HouseGuests learn that the three are in the house before going outside to compete in their first Head of Household competition. The HouseGuests then competed in the [...] "Mushroom Madness" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests paired up into teams of two. Due to the uneven number of players, Nick chose to sit out. One HouseGuest, the [...] "sitter", was required to answer questions while their partner spun on an <b>over-sized</b> mushroom. When the sitter answered incorrectly, their partner's mushroom began spinning faster. The final pair remaining was Eric and Kail, meaning one of them would become the new Head of Household. The three upstairs then learned that they were given the option of selecting the first Head of Household; they chose Kail. Due to them being unable to compete, the three HouseGuests upstairs were immune from the first eviction. On Day 3, the HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Butter Me Up" [...] food competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were required to pour butter onto their bodies while their teammates attempted to take the butter from their body and fill up a tub of popcorn using their hands; the team with the most pounds of butter was the winner. The competition resulted in Daniele, Eric, Jameka, Jessica, Joe, Nick, and Zach being on slop for the week.|$|E
2500|$|Following Allison's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Time After Time" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were asked true or false {{questions}} as to whether one event occurred before or after another event. Ryan was the winner. Shortly afterwards, Adam, James, Matt, and Ryan formed an alliance, and chose to target Sharon that week. On Day 29, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "A Little 'Fon Will 'Due' Ya!" [...] food competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were separated into two teams, and were required to get into two pools of chocolate {{one at a time}} and spell out words with the letters inside. The team with the most correctly spelled words would win the competition, but would only win the food items they had spelled. The team of Chelsia, Joshuah, Sharon, and Sheila were the losers, thus were put on the slop diet for the week. That same day, Ryan chose to nominate Sharon and Chelsia for eviction. Following this, Chelsia, James, Joshuah, Sharon, and Sheila devised a plan to get Ryan to backdoor Matt that week, and they told Natalie in hopes of getting her to agree with the plan. Despite initially agreeing, she later informed Matt of this plan. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Adam, Sheila, and Joshuah were selected to compete; Matt was selected to host. On Day 30, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Color of Veto" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests used an <b>over-sized</b> pool stick to shoot their ball {{as close as possible to}} the center of the pool table. The HouseGuest furthest away each round was eliminated, and would be able to select a prize. Ryan was the winner of the competition, however, chose to take a prize and allowed Chelsia to win the Power of Veto. Despite Ryan agreeing to the plan to backdoor Matt, Sheila later became offended by Chelsia and attempted to convince Ryan to keep Matt in the game. On Day 32, Chelsia chose to use the Power of Veto to remove herself from the block, with James being nominated in her place. On Day 35, James became the seventh HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of five to one. Following this, it was revealed that the viewers had voted for one HouseGuest to return to the game, and that the current HouseGuests would vote to either bring back America's selection or the recently evicted James; though not revealed to the HouseGuests, Alex was selected by the viewers to return. James was later voted back into the house in a vote of five to three.|$|E
60|$|With this {{helpless}} {{limitation on}} the part of the defence, the case came to trial. Everybody remembers it,--how for six weeks it was the daily food of Calaveras County; how for six weeks the intellectual and moral and spiritual competency of Mr. James Byways to dispose of his property was discussed with learned and formal obscurity in the court, and with unlettered and independent prejudice by camp-fires and in bar-rooms. At the end of that time, when it was logically established that at least nine-tenths of the population of Calaveras were harmless lunatics, and everybody else's reason seemed to totter on its throne, an exhausted jury succumbed one day to the presence of Peg in the court-room. It was not a prepossessing presence at any time; but the excitement, and an injudicious attempt to ornament herself, brought her defects into a glaring relief that was almost unreal. Every freckle on her face stood out and asserted itself singly; her pale blue eyes, that gave no indication of her force of character, were weak and wandering, or stared blankly at the judge; her <b>over-sized</b> head, broad at the base, terminating in the scantiest possible light-colored braid in the middle of her narrow shoulders, was as hard and uninteresting as the wooden spheres that topped the railing against which she sat.|$|E
