40|$|Controlling {{the water}} content within a product {{has long been}} {{required}} in the chemical processing, agriculture, food storage, paper manufacturing, semiconductor, pharmaceutical and fuel industries. The limitations of water content measurement {{as an indicator of}} safety and quality are attributed to differences in the strength with which water associates with other components in the product. Water activity indicates how tightly water is "bound," structurally or chemically, in products. Water absorption introduces changes in the volume and refractive index of poly(methyl methacrylate) PMMA. Therefore for a grating made in PMMA based optical fiber, its wavelength is an indicator of water absorption and PMMA thus {{can be used as a}} water activity sensor. In this work we have investigated the performance of a PMMA based <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>grating</b> as a water activity sensor in sugar solution, saline solution and Jet A- 1 aviation fuel.
