25|$|On {{arrival of}} Ibn Taymiyyah and the Shafi'ite scholar in Cairo in 1306, an <b>open</b> <b>meeting</b> was held. The Sultan of Egypt {{at the time}} was Al-Nasir Muhammad and his deputy {{attended}} the <b>open</b> <b>meeting.</b> Ibn Taymiyyah was found innocent. Despite the <b>open</b> <b>meeting,</b> objections regarding his creed continued and he was summoned to the Citadel in Cairo for a Munazara (legal debate), which took place on 8 April 1306. During the Munazara his views on divine attributes, specifically whether a direction could be attributed to God, were debated by the Indian Scholar Safi al-Din al-Hindi, in the presence of Islamic judges. Ibn Taymiyyah failed to convince the judges of his position and so on the recommendation of Al-Hindi was incarcerated for the charge of anthropomorphism. Thereafter, he together with his two brothers were imprisoned in the Citadel of the mountain (Qal‘at al-Jabal), in Cairo until 25 September 1307. He was freed due to the help he received from two Amirs (ruler or military ruler); Salar and Muhanna ibn Isa, but he was not allowed to go back to Syria. He was then, again summoned for a legal debate but this time he convinced the judges of his views and he was allowed to go free.|$|E

25|$|The National Christmas Tree again {{remained}} largely unlit in 1980. President Carter's five-year-old grandson, Jason, {{switched on the}} tree. The tree had been completely decorated with large balls and lights, but {{at a meeting in}} early December 1980 the families of the American hostages asked that the tree remain unlit. The lights on the tree shone for 417 seconds, one second for every day that the hostages had been captive. The lights were then turned off, leaving only the star atop the tree shining. When the hostages were released on January 20, 1981, the tree was redecorated. It was relit for the returning hostages on January 27. 1980 was also the first year that the Pageant of Peace organizers were required by the National Park Service to hold an <b>open</b> <b>meeting</b> to solicit input from the public. Once again, a separate small tree honored of American prisoners of war.|$|E

500|$|In July 1969, Martello {{attended}} an <b>open</b> <b>meeting</b> of the Mattachine Society's New York branch. He was {{appalled at the}} Society's negative reaction to the Stonewall riots, and castigated those gay {{people in the audience}} who accepted the categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness, accusing them of being self-loathing. He proceeded to publish his thoughts in an essay in which he stated that [...] "homosexuality is not a problem in itself. The problem is society's attitude towards it." [...] Those gay rights activists who rejected the Mattachine Society's approach and who favored a confrontational stance against the police and authorities founded the Gay Liberation Front (GLF), with Martello elected the group's first moderator. Martello supported the GLF's stance that condemned [...] "this rotten, dirty, vile, fucked-up capitalist conspiracy" [...] that dominated American society, and he volunteered by producing articles both for the group's newsletter Come Out! and for the wider press. He was involved in the GLF's campaign against The Village Voices decision to ban the word [...] "gay" [...] from advertisements; the magazine preferred the term [...] "homophile", which had also been used by the Mattachine Society. Wanting to break from previous gay liberation organizations, the GLF embraced the term [...] "gay", with Martello dismissing [...] "homophile" [...] as sounding like a nail file for homosexuals.|$|E
500|$|Bowdoin {{ran against}} Hancock in {{subsequent}} elections, but {{was never able}} to overcome Hancock's enormous popularity. [...] The contest between the two men was just one element of a long-running rivalry that encompassed business, politics, and religion, and was apparently deeply personal. [...] The two men were both involved in the administration of Harvard, where their feud sometimes became ugly. [...] For example, in 1776, while Hancock was simultaneously treasurer of Harvard and president of the Second Continental Congress, a committee headed by Bowdoin decided that securities physically held by Hancock were at risk because of the war, and a delegation was sent to Philadelphia to receive an accounting of them and physical custody of the papers. [...] Hancock's dilatory responses and refusal to produce an accounting of the college books dragged on for several years, as a result of which Bowdoin orchestrated his censure by the Harvard board of overseers. [...] The matter reached a peak of sorts in 1783 when the college's issues with Hancock were read and discussed in an <b>open</b> <b>meeting</b> at which Hancock was the presiding officer. [...] Both Bowdoin and Hancock attended the Brattle Street Church, where they competed with each other over the size and quality of the improvements to the building (and even the location of a new one) that they funded. [...] James Warren captured {{the differences between the two}} men: [...] "I don't envy either of them their feelings. the Vanity of one will Sting like an Adder if it is disappointed, and the Advancements made by the other if they dont succeed will hurt his Modest pride." [...] The rivalry between the men was so bitter that the founding of Bowdoin College, named in his honor, had to be delayed until after Hancock died.|$|E
