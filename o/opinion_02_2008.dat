The structure of houses is crucial for assessing the vulnerability of rural houses. However, at present, available data on rural housing structure are incomplete and their spatial scales are inconsistent.

With the percentage sampling census data in 2005, four accuracy levels were specified. Then, a set of down-scaling models were established, where the impact of climate, economic development level and ethnic minority cultural factors on rural housing structure, as well as the spatial autocorrelation of neighboring spatial units were considered. Based on the estimation results, a database of county-level rural housing structure was established, based on which the vulnerability of rural houses in different areas was clarified...|$|R

40|$|Phage-mediated {{transfer}} of microbial genetic elements plays {{a crucial role}} in bacterial life style and evolution. In this study, we identify the RinA family of phage-encoded proteins as activators required for transcription of the late operon in a large group of temperate staphylococcal phages. RinA binds to a tightly regulated promoter region, situated upstream of the terS gene, that controls expression of the morphogenetic and lysis modules of the phage, activating their transcription. As expected, rinA deletion eliminated formation of functional phage particles and significantly decreased the {{transfer of}} phage and pathogenicity island encoded virulence factors. A genetic analysis of the late promoter region showed that a fragment of 272 bp contains both the promoter and the region necessary for activation by RinA. In addition, we demonstrated that RinA is the only phage-encoded protein required for the activation of this promoter region. This region was shown to be divergent among different phages. Consequently, phages with divergent promoter regions carried allelic variants of the RinA protein, which specifically recognize its own promoter sequence. Finally, most Gram-postive bacteria carry bacteriophages encoding RinA homologue proteins. Characterization of several of these proteins demonstrated that control by RinA of the phage-mediated packaging and transfer of virulence factor is a conserved mechanism regulating horizontal gene transfer.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Coroners' death {{certificates}} {{form the}} basis of suicide statistics in England and Wales. Recent increases in coroners' use of narrative verdicts may affect the reliability of local and national suicide rates. METHOD: We used Ministry of Justice data on inquests held between 2008 and 2009 and Local Authority suicide data (2001 - <b>02</b> and <b>2008</b> - 09) to investigate variations between coroners in their use of narrative verdicts and the impact of these on suicide rates, using 'other' verdicts (79 % of which are narratives) as a proxy for narrative verdicts. RESULTS: There was wide geographic variation in Coroners' use of 'other' (mainly narrative) verdicts [...] they comprised between 0 and 50 % (median = 9 %) of verdicts given by individual coroners in 2008 - 09. Coroners who gave more 'other' verdicts gave fewer suicide verdicts (r = - 0. 41; P < 0. 001). In the 10 English Coroners' jurisdictions where the highest proportion of 'other' verdicts were given, the incidence of suicide decreased by 16 % between 2001 - <b>02</b> and <b>2008</b> - 09, whereas it did not change in areas served by the 10 coroners who used narratives the least. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in Coroners' use of narrative verdicts influences the validity of reported regional suicide rates.
