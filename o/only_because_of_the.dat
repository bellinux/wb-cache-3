5|$|Justice Souter joined Breyer's {{opinion in}} all respects but wrote {{separately}} to condition his support {{on the belief that}} the search was appropriate <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immediate danger that the evidence could have been destroyed. Only in this unique instance could the warrant requirement be waived.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's success {{continued}} in the NFL in 1950, silencing skeptics who thought the team stood out <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor quality of competition in the AAFC. After beating the defending NFL champion Philadelphia Eagles {{in the first game}} of the season, the Browns advanced to the championship game, where they beat the Los Angeles Rams 30–28 on a last-second Lou Groza field goal. Speedie had 548 receiving yards during the season and was selected for the NFL's first-ever Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Mahesh {{received}} the film's script while dubbing for Dookudu (2011), {{but due to}} that commitment took ten days to finish reading the script. He {{said in an interview}} that he could maintain the consistency in the character <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fewer working days. Jagannadh did not cast Brahmanandam and Ali because of Mahesh's specific characterisation; he added that Mahesh's voice had changed when compared to his performance in Pokiri. Mahesh also convinced Jagannadh to give up smoking, since he himself was trying to give up after being a chain smoker.|$|E

5|$|Olmstead was {{inducted}} into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1985. Olmstead, with his wife Nora, visited the town of Okotoks, Alberta on August 13, 2005, with the Stanley Cup. He had previously declined to spend a day with it, believing that it was being given to much older winners <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lockout. Olmstead also noted, {{at the end of the}} day, that he was happy to have the Stanley Cup again. Olmstead died at his home in High River, Alberta on November 16, 2015, due to complications from a stroke.|$|E
5|$|Several nearby office blocks {{were hit}} {{so badly that}} almost every window, front and back, was blown in as the {{explosion}} ripped through them. The timing of the explosion before work hours possibly prevented additional casualties. Reports also indicated that cars in nearby streets caught fire. The roof {{of at least one}} house was blown off. Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smoke and possibility of more explosions, but because of the danger of structural damage making the buildings unstable.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the time}} of de Vaux, the default {{assumption}} {{has been that the}} Wicked Priest is a single individual, if <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> appealing parallelism to the Teacher of Righteousness. The consensus time period for the founding of Qumran (150-140 BCE) includes five High Priests: three Hellenized and two Maccabean: Jason, Menelaus, Alcimus, Jonathan, and Simon, and also the various figures potentially associated with the intersacerdotium.|$|E

50|$|According to the glottalic theory, the Proto-Indo-European {{language}} had {{a series}} of ejectives (or, in some versions, implosives), but no extant Indo-European language has retained them. Ejectives are found today in Ossetic and Eastern Armenian <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nearby Northeast Caucasian and/or Kartvelian language families.|$|R
5|$|The {{city walls}} have been {{preserved}} {{to the present}} day, not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knowledge of the skilled construction workers and the constant care provided by city dwellers that maintained and rebuilt the structures as needed, {{but also because of}} the brilliantly reputed diplomacy in Ragusa, which managed on many occasions to avoid dangerous measures taken by enemies against the Republic of Ragusa.|$|E
5|$|The fiddle, and {{traditional}} music in general, remained popular in Donegal not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international coverage of certain artists {{but because of}} local pride in the music. Traditional music Seisiúns are still common place both in pubs and in houses. The Donegal fiddle music has been influenced by recorded music, but this is claimed {{to have had a}} positive impact on the tradition. Modern Donegal fiddle music is often played in concerts and recorded on albums.|$|E
5|$|This metric {{contains}} a scale factor, which {{describes how the}} size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a coordinate system to be made, called comoving coordinates. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their coordinate distance (comoving distance) remains constant, the physical distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the scale factor of the universe.|$|E

5|$|Betances' {{last days}} were chaotic, not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{events in the}} Caribbean, {{but also because of}} what {{happening}} in his own household. Jiménez' mental state is reported as dubious by then. Some even suggest that she had become an alcoholic (probably) or even a morphine addict (unlikely) by then, and she even wished for her husband to die in tantrums reported by his doctors. Political foes attempted to gain possession of Betances' intelligence dossiers, as did Spanish intelligence agents in Paris. Betances asked personal friends to keep personal guard of him, which they did until he died.|$|E
5|$|Cairano was {{undoubtedly}} {{affected by this}} period of sudden and profound decay, if <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sharp decline in commissions. After a decade of intense activity with several overlapping projects, a new stage in his career began, one which is obscured from the documentary view. The last relevant document {{in this regard is}} the contract for the entrance to the Duomo of Chiari in 1513, while the next document, in 1517, states that Cairano was already dead. Apart from this, there are other works from the period attributed to him, including the complex question of the completion of the Martinengo mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|Corder {{was taken}} back to Suffolk where he was tried at Shire Hall, Bury St Edmunds. The trial started on 7 August 1828, having been put back several days because of the {{interest}} which the case had generated. The hotels in Bury St Edmunds began to fill up from as early as 21 July, and admittance to the court was by ticket <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large numbers who wanted to view the trial. Despite this, the judge and court officials still had to push their way bodily through the crowds that had gathered around the door.|$|E

5000|$|A {{warrant for}} his arrest was issued by the Royal Parliament, and his {{possessions}} again confiscated. <b>Only</b> now, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dynastic pretentions expressed in them, Baluze's Histoire was banned and <b>the</b> building <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tomb at Cluny prevented.|$|R
5|$|In December 2016, {{after it}} was {{announced}} that Phase 2 might cost $6 billion, transit experts expressed concern that the Second Avenue Subway might be so excessively costly as to preclude construction of Phases 3 and 4, as well as future expansions. One expert stated that the Phase 1 project was the most expensive subway project in the world, and that compared to other subway systems around the world, the cost of building new subways in New York City was much higher. The Second Avenue Subway's per-mile construction cost is higher than that of other projects in similar cities like London's Crossrail and Paris's Grand Paris Express, which themselves are among the most expensive underground-railway projects in the world. MTA officials stated that the Second Avenue Subway cost as much as it did <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex underground infrastructure in Manhattan, as well as the fact that the New York City Subway runs all the time.|$|E
5|$|The Colombian {{tariff system}} {{is defined in}} the Ley de Servicios Públicos or Public Services Law from 1994. It is applied in public, mixed and private companies. The tariff system aims at {{reconciling}} the achievement of cost recovery with {{the protection of the}} poor. The basic tariff is calculated on the basis of economic costs according to a methodology defined at the national level by CRA (Law 287 of 2004). Therefore, in principle, tariffs in different municipalities do not differ due to local government’s decisions to raise tariffs or not, but <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different costs of the services.|$|E
5|$|The DPP {{argued that}} it was never the {{intention}} of The Chaser to breach security and that they were allowed into the restricted area <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mistakes of the police. The laws enacted for the summit meant that entry into the restricted zone needed justification, which could include police permission. The DPP stated that by waving The Chaser through, they had granted permission to be in the restricted zone. A further defence was available: all members charged, except Morrow, could argue that they were present for work-related purposes, and part of their employment was to be with Morrow, who was directing the stunt.|$|E

50|$|Stegocephalids {{extend their}} legs once {{resting on a}} substrate. In {{observations}} on captive specimens, they {{do not seem to}} have the tendency to burrow into the substrate, though this might <b>only</b> be <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> prey in <b>the</b> laboratory substrates.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the chosen}} Fourier convention, {{one of these}} {{represents}} an outward travelling wave and the other an nonphysical inward travelling wave. The inward travelling solution wave is <b>only</b> nonphysical <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> singularity that occurs at r=0; inward travelling waves do exist.|$|R
5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E
5|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, weighing 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated {{into the top of}} the frame. A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch, after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The revolver is double-action <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Two {{sites were}} chosen to {{study the effects of}} cane toads on the {{northern}} quoll, one of which was at Mary River ranger station, which is located in the southern region of Kakadu National Park. The other site was located {{at the north end of}} the park. In addition to these two sites, there was a third site located at the East Alligator ranger station, and this site was used as a control site, where the cane toads would not interact with the northern quoll population. Monitoring of the quoll population began at the Mary River ranger station using radio tracking in 2002, months before the first cane toads arrived at the site. After the arrival of the cane toads, the population of northern quolls in the Mary River site plummeted between October and December 2002, and by March 2003, the northern quoll appeared to be extinct in this section of the park, as there were no northern quolls caught in the trapping trips in the following two months. In contrast, the population of northern quolls in the control site at the East Alligator ranger station remained relatively constant, not showing any symptoms of declining. The evidence from the Kakadu National Park is compelling not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> timing of the population of northern quolls plummeting just months after the arrival of the cane toad, but also because in the Mary River region 31% of mortalities within the quoll population were attributed to lethal toxic ingestion, as there were no signs of disease, parasite infestation, or any other obvious changes at the site that could have caused such a rapid decline. The most obvious piece of evidence which supports the hypothesis that the invasion of the cane toads caused the local extinction of the northern quoll is that the closely monitored population of the control group, in the absence of cane toads, showed no signs of decline.|$|E
50|$|Both the Maoists and the Nepalese {{government}} used torture {{techniques to}} extract confessions and to force citizens {{to act in}} accordance with their dictates. Stevenson (2001) reports that 50% of torture victims stated they <b>only</b> confessed <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> torture they received.|$|R
50|$|Luryi {{proposed}} {{a variety of}} devices using 2DEGs, which <b>only</b> work <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low 2DEG density-of-states, and its associated quantum capacitance effect. For example, in the three-plate configuration metal-insulator-2DEG-insulator-metal, the quantum capacitance effect means that the two capacitors interact with each other.|$|R
