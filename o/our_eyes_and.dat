HitFix's Alan Sepinwall titled his review [...] "The rules get upended in a terrific episode." [...] Both Elio Garcia from westeros.org and Jace Lacob from Televisionary considered it the best episode of the series so far. In the words of reviewer Jace Lacob, the episode [...] "revolves around changes both great and small, {{about the way the}} scales can fall from <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> we can see the truth that has been standing in front of us for so long. For Eddard, it's a realization of just why Jon Arryn died, of the terrible secret he had gleaned from the book of royal lineages, and just what this could mean for the throne...and for the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. For Dany, it's the brutal truth of her brother's real nature, of his insatiable thirst for power and the twisted quality of his rampant heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Lady Gaga {{collaborated with}} RedOne and Space Cowboy {{in writing and}} {{producing}} [...] "So Happy I Could Die". All {{three of them were}} the main instrumentalists behind the song and recorded it at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. Other personnel who worked on the song includes Johny Severin for vocal editing and audio engineering, Dave Russell for audio engineering and Mike Orton for mixing the song at Sarm West Studios. An occasional drinker, the song represents Gaga's fear of what she describes as the [...] "Alcohol Monster", as evident of several lyrics in the song, such as the chorus; [...] "Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine, stars in <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> we're having a good time." [...] In an interview with MTV, Gaga professed that the song is about the euphoric effects of alcohol—the so-called [...] "happy place"—and explained that her fear is split between two songs. [...] "My fear of alcohol. My fear of drugs... fear of addiction. [...] But alcohol is funny because it takes you down to this very happy place and just like forgetting all your problems and for just a minute you're so happy, {{and then all of a}} sudden, [...] stomach turns and go way down... And that's my relationship with consumption and abuse." [...] Other meaning behind the song was given by a writer for Elle magazine, which described it as [...] "about masturbating while thinking about a woman". The singer also acknowledged on her Twitter account that while writing the song she was inspired by English singer Lily Allen.|$|E
2500|$|The art {{historian}} Michael Rosenthal described Gainsborough as [...] "one {{of the most}} technically proficient and, at the same time, most experimental artists of his time". He was noted for {{the speed with which}} he applied paint, and he worked more from observations of nature (and of human nature) than from application of formal academic rules. The poetic sensibility of his paintings caused Constable to say, [...] "On looking at them, we find tears in <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> know not what brings them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Eastern Orthodox {{portrayal}} of the Ascension is a major metaphor for the mystical nature of the Church. In many Eastern icons the Virgin Mary is placed {{at the center of}} the scene in the earthly part of the depiction, with her hands raised towards Heaven, often accompanied by various Apostles. The upwards-looking depiction of the earthly group matches the Eastern liturgy on the Feast of the Ascension: [...] "Come, let us rise and turn <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> thoughts high..." ...|$|E

It occurred about 7.5 billion years ago (roughly equal to half the time since the Big Bang), taking the light that long to reach Earth. It was suggested by Larry Sessions, a science writer for Sky and Telescope magazine blogging on earthsky.org, that the burst be named “The Clarke Event". American Atheist Magazine wrote of the idea, “It would be a fitting tribute to a man who contributed so much, and helped lift <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> our minds to a cosmos once thought to be province only of gods.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Previc further subdivides extrapersonal space into focal-extrapersonal space, action-extrapersonal space, and ambient-extrapersonal space. [...] Focal-extrapersonal {{space is}} located in the lateral temporo-frontal {{pathways}} at the center of our vision, is retinotopically centered and tied to the position of <b>our</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> is involved in object search and [...] recognition. [...] Action-extrapersonal-space {{is located in}} the medial temporo-frontal pathways, spans the entire space, and is head-centered and involved in orientation and locomotion in topographical space. [...] Action-extrapersonal space provides the [...] "presence" [...] of our world. [...] Ambient-extrapersonal space initially courses through the peripheral parieto-occipital visual pathways before joining up with vestibular and other body senses to control posture and orientation in earth-fixed/gravitational space. [...] Numerous studies involving peripersonal and extrapersonal neglect have shown that peripersonal space is located dorsally in the parietal lobe whereas extrapersonal space is housed ventrally in the temporal lobe.|$|E
2500|$|An undated, typewritten Bikini Kill tour flier {{answers the}} {{question}} [...] "What is Riot grrrl?" [...] with: [...] " [...] Because we girls {{want to create}} mediums that speak to US.

[...] We will never know if we don't break the code of silence... Because in every form of media we see ourselves slapped, decapitated, laughed at, objectified, raped, trivialized, pushed, ignored, stereotyped, kicked, scorned, molested, silenced, invalidated, knifed, shot, choked and killed. Because a safe space needs to be created for girls where we can open <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> reach out to each other without being threatened by this sexist society and our day to day bullshit."Like other third wave feminists, riot grrrls attempted to foster an acceptance of diversity within feminist expression.

5000|$|Klein draws a {{connection}} between these stylistic and technical features, taken together, {{and the influence of}} music on the artist's work: [...] "In his paintings, the relationship between the figure and ground - the painted space outside of the figure - shifts and alters.

25|$|As an example, {{suppose that}} {{light in the}} orange range of {{wavelengths}} (approximately 577nm to 597nm) enters the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> strikes the retina. Light of these wavelengths would activate both the medium and long wavelength cones of the retina, but not equally—the long-wavelength cells will respond more. The difference in the response can be detected by the brain, and this difference {{is the basis of}} our perception of orange. Thus, the orange appearance of an object results from light from the object entering <b>our</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> stimulating the different cones simultaneously but to different degrees.|$|R

On the contrary", and that [...] "We want an agreement with two factors, the first of which is the recognition of Israel as the national state of the Jewish people and [...] a security settlement. In the case of Gaza, both of these factors were lacking". He also said, [...] "Should we achieve a turn toward peace with the more moderate partners, we will insist on the recognition of the State of Israel and the demilitarization of the future Palestinian state". In October 2014, Netanyahu said [...] "We don't just hand over territory, close <b>our</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> hope for the best. We did that in Lebanon and we got thousands of rockets. We did that in Gaza, we got Hamas and 15,000 rockets. So we're not gonna just replicate that.
