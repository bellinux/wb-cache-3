40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the level of {{academic}} locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the students who study pre-school education program. The sample of study is 329 students selected randomly in Faculty of Education from a mid-sized state University. In the study, Personal Information Form and Academic Locus <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> Scale prepared by researchers were used. Academic Locus <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> Scale includes two sub-dimensions; internal locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and external locus <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Independent samples t test was used to show differences between variables and sub-dimensions. According to findings, there is a significant difference between scores of internal and external locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> females and scores of internal and external locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> males. Whereas the average score of external locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> female is lower than male’, point average of internal locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> female is high. There is a significant difference between scores of internal and external locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> 1 stgrade students and scores of internal and external locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> 4 stgrade students.

5|$|A {{strain of}} truly domesticated red foxes was {{introduced}} by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E

We examined the self-esteem, internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> through sociodemographic and neurocognitive factors. Methods: Forty-six schizophrenic patients and 31 healthy residents from the community or hospital were recruited as the control group. All subjects participated in the self-esteem questionnaire, health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> questionnaire, {{and a series of}} neuropychological measures. Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed that inhibition of attention and external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> were predictors for self-esteem (r=− 0. 30, P< 0. 05; r= 0. 41, P< 0. 01); inhibition of attention and external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> were contributors for internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> (r=− 0. 43, P< 0. 01; r= 0. 61, P< 0. 001); and education was related to external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> (r=− 0. 31, P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The current study integrated background characteristics and cognitive function to better understand the impact of self-esteem and health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in schizophrenia. The findings indicated that inhibition of attention, external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and education contributed to self-esteem, internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and external health locus <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> However, the overall predicted variance accounted for by these predictors was small; thus, further research is necessary to examine imperative variables related with self-esteem and health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in schizophrenia.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and functioning in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) was investigated. The hypothesis {{was that an}} internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> {{would be associated with}} less impairment in functioning than other dimensions of health locus <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Prior research undertaken into CFS has been inconsistent in its finding's and it continues to be an area of controversial interpretations. A repeated measures design was used, 74 people participated at the initial stage of the study and 67 people participated in the second stage. The Functional Limitations Profile was used to assess levels of impairment. The Multidimensional Health Locus <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> was used to identify types of health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> orientation, and the Shapiro Control Inventory was used to establish a clearer picture <b>of</b> <b>control</b> issues. Correlations and t-tests were used to investigate the {{relationship between}} health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and functioning. The results of these analyses indicated that an internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> was positively related to functioning. Multiple regression analysis was performed and showed that an internal health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> could successfully predict functioning measured at the second stage of the study. An unexpected discovery was that a doctor's health locus <b>of</b> <b>control</b> impacted negatively on functioning. The Shapiro Control Inventory revealed that the CFS sample fell within the normal range in the majority <b>of</b> <b>control</b> areas, but was outside the normal range in only six <b>of</b> the 23 <b>control</b> areas.

5|$|She {{observed}} {{the effects of}} the transposition of Ac and Ds by the changing patterns of coloration in maize kernels over generations <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> crosses, and described {{the relationship between the two}} loci through intricate microscopic analysis. She concluded that Ac controls the transposition of the Ds from chromosome9, and that the movement of Ds is accompanied by the breakage of the chromosome. When Ds moves, the aleurone-color gene is released from the suppressing effect of the Ds and transformed into the active form, which initiates the pigment synthesis in cells. The transposition of Ds in different cells is random, it may move in some but not others, which causes color mosaicism. The size of the colored spot on the seed is determined by stage of the seed development during dissociation. McClintock also found that the transposition of Ds is determined by the number of Ac copies in the cell.|$|E

5|$|Several {{relatively}} simple chemical tests — commercially available as reagent testing kits — {{can be used}} to assess the presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the Mandelin test. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis test will react with many classes <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> drugs, such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings, including amphetamine and methamphetamine. Ehrlich's reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer chromatography. Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography, the high temperature required to vaporize the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In forensic toxicology, techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used with ultraviolet, fluorescence, electrochemical, and electrospray mass spectrometric detection methods.|$|E

By discussing instances of skilful absorption from different cultural backgrounds I argue that the notion <b>of</b> <b>control</b> is not as closely related to self-consciousness as is often suggested.

The second is the view that losing this self-conscious type <b>of</b> <b>control</b> is a negative and upsetting experience. By focusing on “the paradox of control” in these experiences of skilful absorption, I argue that a feeling <b>of</b> <b>control</b> can occur without a self that narratively claims control.
