40|$|On-line {{learning}} in environments and applications with time-varying behavior pose serious challenges. Changes may lead the learning model designed with old data, to become {{inconsistent with the}} new data, so that adaptation strategies are necessary. Unfortunately, most adaptation strategies are performed only on a batch basis, i. e. after accumulating certain number of samples. This process usually requires a long time, and thus such data may not reflect {{the current state of}} the system. However, even the learning system is adapted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>basis,</b> most existing on-line learning algorithms adapt slowly to the abrupt changes. To overcome these drawbacks, a new dynamic and on-line ensemble regression (DOER) with fast adaptation capability for on-line prediction of variables given <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>basis</b> is proposed in this paper. DOER brings together desired properties which are not given by the previous works on on-line ensemble for regression: (1) on-line inclusion and removal of models to keep only the most accurate models with respect to {{the current state of the}} system; (2) dynamic adaptation of the models ’ weights based on their on-line predictions on the recent samples; and (3) on-line adaptation of the models ’ parameters. The accuracy of each model is obtained using a sliding window that is filled with the predictive errors of the most recent samples. Based on the model’s accuracies, weights are dynamically assigned, where accurate models are heavily weighted. When a new sample is available, all the models are retrained, and a new model may be included if the ensemble’s performance is not satisfactory. Inaccurate models can be removed for reducing the computational costs. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets are reported to evaluate the effectiveness of the DOER. Results show that DOER offers faster adaptation capability when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches...|$|E

30|$|After {{the network}} {{topology}} is specified, {{the next step}} in the scenario setup is to enter the transmission parameters. This covers the whole transmission chain, including the specification of the applied channel coding scheme, the multicarrier waveform, the applied channel model, as well as the equalizers and decoders employed by the receiver. Parameters can either be set locally for each link and node, or conveniently globally, in case all links and nodes use the same settings. Setting different parameters for different links enables coexistence investigations of multiple technologies; for example, one cell could be set up to operate with OFDM and turbo coding while the other cell uses FBMC with low-density parity-check (LDPC) coding. This allows to investigate the sensitivity w.r.t. out-of-cell interference of such systems.

Six yarding systems were studied: highlead, North Bend skyline, Grabinski running skyline, shotgun skyline ("flyer"), balloon, inverted skyline, and helicopter.

In addition to providing information for building improved sampling frames and better sample design, linking the two Censuses offers many advantages. The agriculture module of the Census of Population provides complete enumeration of agricultural households (and sometimes information on rural communities) which allows presentation of data for small geographical/administrative units, increasing considerably the value and relevance of the whole census operation. Also as the same identification of households is used for both censuses there is scope for in-depth analysis using cross-tabulations of agricultural data with the socio-economic and demographic data from the Census of Population.

40|$|Pooling {{techniques}} commonly {{are used}} to increase the throughput of samples used for screening purposes. While the advantages of such techniques are increased analytical efficiency and cost savings, the sensitivity of measurements decreases because it is inversely proportional {{to the number of}} samples in the pools. Consequently, uncertainties in estimates of dose and risk which are {{based on the results of}} pooled samples increase as the number of samples in the pools increases in all applications. However, sensitivities may not be seriously degraded, for example, in urinalysis, if the samples in the pools are of known time duration, or if the fraction of some attribute of the grab urine samples to that in a 24 -hour composite is known (e. g., mass, specific gravity, creatinine, or volume, per 24 -h interval). This paper presents square and cube pooling schemes that greatly increase throughput and can considerably reduce analytical costs (<b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>basis).</b> The benefit-cost ratios for 5 {times} 5 square and 5 {times} 5 {times} 5 cube pooling schemes are 2. 5 and 8. 3, respectively. Three-dimensional and higher arrayed pooling schemes would result in even greater economies; however, significant improvements in analytical sensitivity are required to achieve these advantages. These are various other considerations for designing a pooling scheme, where the number of dimensions and of samples in the optimum array are influenced by: (1) the minimal detectable amount (MDA) of the analytical processes, (2) the screening dose-rate requirements, (3) the maximum masses or volumes of the composite samples that can be analyzed, (4) the information already available from results of composite analysis, and (5) the ability of an analytical system to guard against both false negative and false positive results.

40|$|Many estimation, prediction, and {{learning}} applications have a dynamic nature. One {{of the most}} important chal-lenges in machine learning is dealing with concept changes. Underlying changes may make the model designed on old data, inconsistent with new data. Also, algorithms usually specialize in one type of change. Other chal-lenge is reusing previously acquired information in scenarios where changes may recur. This strategy improves the learning accuracy and reduces the processing time. Unfortunately, most existing learning algorithms to deal with changes are adapted on a batch basis. This process usually requires a long time, and such data may not reflect {{the current state of the}} system. However, even if the system is adapted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>basis,</b> existing algorithms may adapt slowly to changes and cannot conciliate old and new information. This paper proposes an On-line Weighted Ensemble (OWE) of regressor models which is able to learn incrementally sample by sample in the presence of several types of changes and simultaneously retain old information in recurring scenarios. The key idea is to keep a moving window that slides when a new sample is available. The error of each model on the current window is determined using a boosting strategy that assigns small errors to the models that predict accurately the samples predicted poorly by the ensemble. To handle recurring and non-recurring changes, OWE uses a new assignment of models ’ weights that takes into account the models ’ errors on the past and current windows using a discounting factor that decreases or increases the contribution of old windows. In addition, OWE launches new models if the system’s accuracy is decreasing, and it can exclude inaccurate models over time. Experiments with artificial and industrial data reveal that in most cases OWE outperforms other state-of-the-art concept drift approaches...|$|E

In performing such winter maintenance, the selection of appropriate chemicals for the bond prevention task involves consideration of a number of factors, as indicated in Nixon and Williams (2001). The factors are in essence performance measurements of the chemicals, and as such can be easily incorporated into a specification document to allow for selection of the best chemical(s) for a given agency to use in its winter maintenance activities. Once performance measures for de-icing or anti-icing chemicals have been specified, this allows the creation of a quality control program for the acceptance of those chemicals. This paper presents a series of performance measurement tests for chemicals, and discusses the role that they can play in such a quality control program.

The survey covered the whole country <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>basis</b> covering 651 Standard Enumeration Areas. About 10, 000 households were interviewed in total. The first survey took place from October to November, 1991 and covered 500 Standard Enumeration Areas and about 10, 000 households. This survey was conducted by the Central Statistical Office and was fully funded by the Norwegian government through the World Bank. The Central Statistical Office is organised into three subject-matter branches, namely Economic and financial statistics, Social and cultural statistics and Agriculture and environment statistics. Each of these branches is headed by an Assistant Director. The Priority survey was conducted and managed by the Social and cultural statistics branch. The Social Dimensions of Adjustment (SDA) project was launched in 1987 by the World Bank with the United Nations Development Programme and the African Development Bank as partners. Many other multilateral and bilateral agencies have supported the project financially and technically in several countries of sub-saharan Africa.

Project NEP/ 88 / 024 "National Sample Census of Agriculture 1991 / 92 " was signed by the Government on 13 February 1990, by FAO on 26 February 1990 and by UNDP on 1 March 1990. The project was scheduled to last for three years. A number of changes were made to the project design at the Tripartite Review meeting in April 1991, and the project was extended to June 1994. The development objective of the project was to provide reliable and comprehensive agricultural census data to facilitate planned development in the agriculture sector {{in order to meet the}} goals established in the development plans of the Government. The immediate objective of the project was to provide technical capability in terms of survey methodology, data processing and analysis within the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) to conduct a national agricultural census comprising 160 000 households by the end of 1992 and in future, to do similar sample censuses without recourse to external assistance. The project successfully met its objectives. The census was conducted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>basis</b> using strict sampling principles and covered the whole of Nepal, including urban areas. Only the household sector was included, agricultural activities undertaken by government organizations, businesses, etc., were excluded. Also, farm households not meeting a minimum size criterion in terms of area of crops or number of animals were excluded from the census. Throughout the project, staff of CBS participated in the various phases of the census work and have been trained in all aspects of the design, data collection, processing and analysis of an agricultural census. The capability of CBS to undertake future agricultural censuses and surveys has been greatly enhanced by the project. In order not to loose the momentum generated by this project, a number of recommendations have been made in the report, which I should like to bring to your attention. It is recommended that CBS continue its programme on census analysis with initial emphasis given to the following areas:-preparation of a small handout for each district, showing highlights of the census;-provision of census tables in computer readable form as required by users; and-preparation of analytical reports on specific topics such as women in agriculture. It is also recommended that CBS develop a suitable policy to enable unit level data to be released, subject to necessary provisions to protect confidentiality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Citizens Advice Administrative Dataset provides information regarding all Citizens Advice clients in England and Wales from April 2008. In particular, Citizens Advice is the national organisation responsible for providing advice and support for problems and issues faced by the public in England and Wales. Advice is provided by 384 Citizens Advice Bureaux (all independent charities) in England and Wales. There are separate national Citizens Advice organisations and CABx in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Citizens Advice {{is one of the}} largest volunteer organisations in the UK, with over 20, 000 volunteers. The service was established in 1939 just after the outbreak of the Second World War to offer members of the public general advice with their problems. The twin aims of Citizens Advice are to provide advice for problems that people have and to improve both the policies and practices which will affect people’s lives. The service offers advice and assistance in many areas including welfare benefits, debt, employment, housing, relationships, consumer issues and health. All Citizens Advice clients that enter a bureau are recorded onto a single database. A single record is created for that client and is updated every time they return to the same bureau. The client record collects information on the client profile (covering age, gender, ethnicity, disability and location of the client), the broad issue that the client seeks advice on (such as benefit, debt), the detail of the problem (such as the type of debt or benefit) and a third category which describes the nature of the advice given. The Bureaux record details of outcomes <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>basis</b> (approximately 7 %) covering advice outcomes (such the amount of benefit gained, debt managed or written off and employment tribunals won) and client outcomes (such as impact on health, relationships and confidence). At the moment advice outcomes are recorded in the case management system. Citizens Advice covers England and Wales only. Similar organisations exist in Scotland and Northern Ireland and together they form the Citizens Advice service network for the UK. Citizens Advice data is available from April 2008. External data is published quarterly six weeks after the end of each quarter. Internal data is consolidated around two to three weeks after each quarter. Data is available monthly for reporting and some data can be accessed in ‘real time’. Data collected in each client’s record is updated each time that they re-visit a bureau and when an outcome from any advice or support becomes available. Note that at present, a separate record is created if a client visits a different bureau. In the future, Citizens Advice plan to collect data onto one centralised system. Citizens Advice will consider applications for their micro level data providing that the research can demonstrate the impact of the Citizens Advice and cover key areas that they provide advice and support for, such as employment issues, discrimination, tribunals, welfare benefits, debt and housing. Research Usage and Linkage The Citizens Advice data is used to look at the problems people are experiencing and how this compares by geography, client profile and over time. Data has been used to inform research by the Government Equalities Office on intersectional discrimination and to look at how the recession was affecting different groups of people. Data was used as part of research by BIS on vulnerable workers. The data has also been used to inform the Cabinet Office on potential avoidable contacts in relation to benefit administration, used to look at the value of services and the return on investment and is routinely used to inform and support a wide range of policy work. Citizens Advice data has not been linked with any other datasets. In theory, it should be possible to link to other datasets using probabilistic matching techniques. </div...|$|E
40|$|In 1953 {{a survey}} of {{tuberculosis}} prevalence, {{carried out by the}} Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare <b>on</b> <b>a</b> statistical <b>sampling</b> <b>basis,</b> yielded valuable data on the status of tuberculosis in Japan. In 1954, a follow-up investigation, conducted on one-third of the areas surveyed in 1953, gave information which helped to elucidate the trend of tuberculosis and changes in the tuberculin-positive rate and in the incidence of the disease. Five years after the first survey, the Ministry of Health and Welfare conducted yet another survey, again by the stratified sampling method, to obtain basic information on the present status of tuberculosis, and, by comparing the results with those of the 1953 survey, to assess the trend of tuberculosis during the five years in question...|$|R

This is an analytical study based mainly on the primary data collected through scientifically developed questionnaires. The questionnaires have been personally administered <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> size of 188 in case of employees and 192 in case of customers, chosen <b>on</b> <b>a</b> random <b>sampling</b> <b>basis</b> from top five banks of Pakistan, i. e. NBP, HBL, MCB, UBL, ABL. SPSS was used to analyze the data. Findings of the study suggest that significant relationship was found between internal service quality perceived by employees, employee satisfaction and loyalty and service quality perceived by customers, customer satisfaction and loyalty. The study also concludes that private banks’ customers and employees are more satisfied with the service quality than that of public banks’...|$|R

The aim is to create such a network for general purpose applications and with a great degree of freedom in choosing the inner structure of the network. The algorithms used are all members of supervised learning classes, i. e. they are all supervised by a desired signal. The theory will be treated thoroughly for the steepest descent algorithm and for additional features which can be employed {{in order to increase}} the degree of generalization and learning rate for the network. Empirical results will be presented and some comparsions with pure linear algorithms will be made for a signal processing applications, speech enhencement...|$|R
