40|$|Provision of {{machining}} accuracy is a relevant objective in technology {{of mechanical engineering}} and its solution allows to guarantee an operational accuracy of mechanisms and machines, their wear resistance, reliability and durability. In order to solve the given task a method has been proposed {{in the paper that}} permits to ensure the highest {{machining accuracy}} margin on the basis of multiple-factor optimization of parameters for technological process while using methods of artificial intelligence. To ensure the machining accuracy by point tools, an intellectual system has been developed and it is based on technologies of functional semantic networks. For revealing correctness of SEMANTIC intellectual system operation an experimental inspection of its working capacity has been carried out in the paper. The paper contains description of the methodology for In article the technique of experimental investigations and their purpose is to make a comparative analysis of actual errors in <b>opening</b> <b>machining</b> with the machining errors predicted by the SEMANTIC system on the basis of functional semantic network application. The investigations have made it possible to determine dependences of axial misalignment in the <b>machined</b> <b>openings</b> on tool advance and its rotation frequency while making openings by high-speed steel drills. The paper presents analysis results of limiting and probable values for components of a total machining error. It has been shown that while making assessment of machining accuracy it is necessary to consider probabilistic nature of occurrence of total error components that are setting upper boundary as it is realized in the described intellectual system. The semantic network permits to compare errors in arrangement of opening axes which are machined in accordance with admissible drill advance and rotation frequency and corresponding experimental values. The experimental investigations prove the possibility to use an approach for forecasting a total machining error which is based on application of functional semantic network technology.   </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Every GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) phone, {{also called}} 2 G mobile phone and every UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) phone, aka 3 G mobile phone {{requires}} a smart card to connect and {{function in the}} mobile network. This smart card is called SIM, which stands for Subscriber Identity Module. In fact, this module contains the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and credentials that are necessary for the identification and authentication of the subscriber. Without the SIM the user {{will not be allowed}} to connect to the mobile network and hence not able to make or receive phone calls. As a smart card the SIM is a tampered resistant microprocessor card with its own operating system, storage and built-in security features that prevent unauthorized individual to access, retrieve, copy or modify the subscriber IMSI and credentials. Abuses of subscriber’s account and fraudulent accesses to the mobile network can hence be avoided. Furthermore, as a removable and autonomous module the SIM introduces great flexibility since the user can easily move the SIM to other mobile phones or replace a SIM with another one. So far, the smart card and its content, the SIM are bound together and called SIM. With the advances in wireless and storage technology, new demands have arisen. Because of cumbersome task of <b>opening</b> <b>machines</b> and installing the removable SIM, the M 2 M applications are designed with pre-installed SIM application. The M 2 M applications based on the cellular networks with the ability of installing the user subscription have advantages and disadvantages for a certain stakeholder. This master’s thesis provides the multiple alternative solutions to this installation and also describe the SIM evolutions i. e. eUICC and soft SIM to give a comprehensive view of the SIM’s situation. The thesis also presents the security assessment of these evolutions which are different with the current removable SIM. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Currently PVM is the {{standard}} for developing parallel applications in workstation environments. One of its goals {{is to use the}} computational power of idling workstations. In practice many users refrain from <b>opening</b> their <b>machine</b> to other users' PVM processes. This is due to their experience that such a process, which usually requires a lot of resources (CPU and memory), increases the response time for short interactive commands, i. e. reduces his own productivity. In the following, we describe an approach which enhances existing queuing systems with a support for parallel PVM applications and allows the migration of PVM processes to other machines. Hence, users who start to work interactively on their machine are no longer bothered by resource consuming PVM processes. 2 Load Leveling with Queuing Systems The interaction of the user with the queuing system is based on the notion of jobs. Formally, a job is the obligation of the que...|$|R
