5|$|Entertainment {{is a form}} <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> {{holds the}} {{attention}} and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but {{is more likely to}} be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.|$|E

25|$|Surface {{activity}} {{appears to}} be related to the age and rotation rate of main-sequence stars. Young stars with a rapid rate of rotation exhibit strong activity. By contrast middle-aged, Sun-like stars with a slow rate of rotation show low levels <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> varies in cycles. Some older stars display almost no activity, which may mean they have entered a lull that is comparable to the Sun's Maunder minimum. Measurements of the time variation in stellar activity can be useful for determining the differential rotation rates of a star.|$|E
25|$|The Viagens {{stories were}} written in two phases; the first, written between 1948 and 1953 and {{published}} between 1949 and 1958, was a burst <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> produced the first four Krishna novels {{and most of the}} non-Krishna pieces, including all the short stories. The second, produced at a more deliberate pace from 1977–1992, comprised the remaining four Krishna novels and the two novels of the Kukulkan sequence. The early works established the setting of a cosmopolitan future interstellar civilization comprising both Terrans {{and a handful of other}} space-faring races who trade and squabble with each other while attempting to maintain a benign stewardship of the more primitive planetary societies with which they come into contact. The later works assumed but largely ignored this background, concentrating exclusively on the adventures of Terrans on the alien worlds of Krishna and Kukulkan.|$|E
500|$|Following the event, eruptive events yearly {{and nearly}} continuous, a state <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> remains today. 1967–1968 saw a {{particularly}} large, 80-million-cubic-meter, 251-day event from Halemaumau Crater. This event was superseded {{the very next}} year by the marathon Mauna Ulu eruption, a large effusive eruption which lasted from May 24, 1969 to July 24, 1974 and added [...] of new land to the island. After eruptive activity had died down, there was a magnitude 7.2 earthquake that caused a partial summit collapse, after which activity did not resume at Kīlauea until 1977.|$|E

500|$|The 1983 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was the longest}} season ever recorded at that time. The 1983 Pacific {{hurricane season}} started on May15, 1983 in the eastern Pacific, and on June1, 1983 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November30, 1983. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. [...] During the 1983season, there were 21 named storms, which was slightly less than the previous season. Furthermore, eight storms reached major hurricane status, or Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). The decaying 1982–83 El Niño event likely contributed to this level <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> <b>That</b> same El Niño influenced a very quiet Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
500|$|Lōʻihi is a {{young and}} fairly active volcano, {{although}} less active than nearby Kīlauea. In the past few decades, several earthquake swarms {{have been attributed to}} Lōʻihi, the largest of which are summarized in the table below. The volcano's activity is now known to predate scientific record keeping of its activity, which commenced in 1959. Most earthquake swarms at Lōʻihi have lasted less than two days; the two exceptions are the 1991–92 earthquake, lasting several months, and the 1996 event, which was shorter but much more pronounced. Both of the earthquakes followed a pattern <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> began on the flank and migrated to the summit. The 1996 event was directly observed by an autonomous ocean bottom observatory (OBO), allowing scientists to calculate the depth of the earthquakes as [...] to [...] below the summit, approximating to the position of Lōʻihi's extremely shallow magma chamber. This is evidence that Lōʻihi's seismicity is volcanic in origin.|$|E
500|$|The {{synaptic}} {{network that}} finally emerges is only partly determined by genes, though. In {{many parts of}} the brain, axons initially [...] "overgrow", and then are [...] "pruned" [...] by mechanisms that depend on neural activity. In the projection from the eye to the midbrain, for example, the structure in the adult contains a very precise mapping, connecting each point {{on the surface of the}} retina to a corresponding point in a midbrain layer. In the first stages of development, each axon from the retina is guided to the right general vicinity in the midbrain by chemical cues, but then branches very profusely and makes initial contact with a wide swath of midbrain neurons. The retina, before birth, contains special mechanisms that cause it to generate waves <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> originate spontaneously at a random point and then propagate slowly across the retinal layer. These waves are useful because they cause neighboring neurons to be active at the same time; that is, they produce a neural activity pattern that contains information about the spatial arrangement of the neurons. This information is exploited in the midbrain by a mechanism that causes synapses to weaken, and eventually vanish, if activity in an axon is not followed by activity of the target cell. The result of this sophisticated process is a gradual tuning and tightening of the map, leaving it finally in its precise adult form.|$|E
