5|$|A {{group of}} cats is {{referred}} to as a clowder or a glaring, a male cat is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered), an unaltered female is called a queen, and a juvenile cat {{is referred to}} as a kitten. The male progenitor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat,</b> especially a pedigreed cat, is its sire, and its female progenitor is its dam. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now obsolete word catling.|$|E
5|$|By the 18thcentury, the menagerie {{was open}} to the public; {{admission}} cost three half-pence or the supply <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> or dog to be fed to the lions. By {{the end of the}} century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811.|$|E
5|$|Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive. Complications from cat bites can develop. A cat bite {{differs from}} the bites of other pets. This is because the teeth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> are sharp and pointed causing deep punctures. Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps {{microorganisms}} that cause infection.|$|E

5|$|Life in {{proximity}} to humans and other domestic animals {{has led to}} a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. Ethologically, the human keeper <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> may function as a sort of surrogate for the cat's mother, and adult housecats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. The high-pitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly hard for humans to ignore.|$|E
5|$|Like all jumping spiders, M. inclemens has {{excellent}} vision. The main eyes, in the front-and-center position, are large, and {{are more}} acute than those <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> and about 10 times as acute as a dragonfly's. The remaining three pairs of eyes are {{along the sides of}} the head, and work as motion detectors. The eyes are used for hunting, for avoiding threats and for finding and wooing mates. Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, and on other arthropods.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of lions at the Tower of London was intermittent, being restocked when a monarch or his consort, such as Margaret of Anjou {{the wife of}} Henry VI, either sought or were given animals. Records indicate they were kept in poor conditions there in the seventeenth century, in contrast to more open conditions in Florence at the time. The menagerie was {{open to the public}} by the eighteenth century; admission was a sum of three half-pence or the supply <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> or dog for feeding to the lions. A rival menagerie at the Exeter Exchange also exhibited lions until the early nineteenth century. The Tower menagerie was closed down by William IV, and animals transferred to the London Zoo, which opened its gates to the public on 27 April 1828.|$|E

50|$|First {{published}} in the UK in 1981 as A Hundred and One Uses <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Dead <b>Cat,</b> the collection was eventually re{{published in}} 20 countries and sold over 2 million copies. It spawned two sequels, 101 More Uses <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Dead <b>Cat</b> and Uses <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Dead <b>Cat</b> in History, as well as calendars featuring the cartoons and even a book in response called The Cat's Revenge - More Than 101 Uses for Dead People. In 2006, a 25th anniversary edition <b>of</b> <b>A</b> Hundred and One Uses <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Dead <b>Cat</b> was published with a new foreword.|$|R
25|$|Skin {{disorders}} {{are among the}} most common health problems in cats and have many causes. The condition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat's</b> skin and coat can be <b>an</b> important indicator <b>of</b> its general health.|$|R
5|$|During the {{original}} era the Panthers {{did not have}} a logo, instead using stylised lettering on the front of their shirts. The club's current logo was adopted in 2003 and is the fifth to be used since the Panthers were reformed. The first was used between 1980 and 1994 and was the silhouette of a Panthers' head in a red circle. The second logo, adopted in 1994, was similar to the first but used a more detailed Panthers' head. The third logo, introduced in 1998, featured a keyhole shaped like the head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> with a Panther reaching through it. The fourth logo was adopted following the move to the National Ice Centre and was similar to the logo of German side Augsburger Panther. The stylised lettering used during {{the original}} era was used again on special shirts made to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the club in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{design to}} the limits, Simonovich-Efimova created puppets {{to be worn}} on the head, {{allowing}} the puppeteer to manipulate several characters simultaneously. She patented {{a new type of}} rod puppet with rods attached to the elbows to free up the hands. The rods were hidden behind hanging costumes. To make puppets look more lifelike, the Efimovs devised a system where the arms were elongated. Rods rather than the puppeteer's fingers were inserted into the glove to manipulate the arms, which were allowed to move by manipulating strings inside the body of the doll. Simonovich-Efimova utilized other apparatus, like springs in the body <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> puppet to give it the flexibility of a live animal. These innovations allowed their finely formed, elegantly clad puppets to move about naturally, rather than with the stiff, jerky movements of their predecessors. In an era when almost all puppet performances were designed to entertain children or present government ideology, Simonovich-Efimova went {{out of her way to}} perform shows for adults, including The Enchanted Pear Tree, Macbeth, and works by Molière and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. Though she also made adaptations in her work with fables to replace what were seen as outmoded ideas, like replacing serfs with young communist characters, Simonovich-Efimova's focus was on artistry, entertainment and professionalism. She also developed a new system of life-sized manikins, blurring the lines between puppetry and acting, when she danced on stage with her Petrushka. Between 1920 and 1940, the Efimovs performed between 1,500 and 2,000 puppet shows.|$|E

50|$|The {{surface area}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat's</b> {{cerebral}} cortex is approximately 83 cm2 whereas {{the human brain}} has <b>a</b> surface area <b>of</b> about 2500 cm2.

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} explanations {{about the origin}} of the name [...] "": one is that it comes from the custom <b>of</b> carrying <b>a</b> sword without a scabbard, held only by <b>a</b> <b>cat's</b> skin (German word [...] means [...] "cat", while [...] means the skin (fur) <b>of</b> <b>an</b> animal. [...] means <b>a</b> piece made <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat’s</b> skin).|$|R

25|$|In the sci-fi comedy Men In Black, {{the last}} words of a dying alien {{disguised}} as a human were 'To prevent war, the Galaxy is on Orion's belt'. It was later revealed that 'Orion's belt' referred to the collar <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cat</b> named 'Orion'.|$|E
