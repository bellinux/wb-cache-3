5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration {{can be very}} detailed in the geographic divisions laid down. It may, for example, allow <b>one</b> <b>party</b> to own {{the right to use}} a mark within a fifty-mile radius around a handful of selected cities or counties, while the other party owns the right to use the same mark everywhere else in the country. It may even divide the rights to use a mark within a particular city by reference to roads or other landmarks in that city.|$|E
5|$|Assignment {{is an area}} of both English {{contract}} law and the law of real estate that governs the transfer of rights from <b>one</b> <b>party</b> to another. This can include the right to enforce a debt. In this situation the party who is assigned the debt can sue the debtor despite any contractual agreement between them. Again, this is permitted by statute, specifically the Law of Property Act 1925.|$|E
5|$|Even where a {{concurrent}} use registration is issued, the parties may eventually {{come to an}} agreement under which <b>one</b> <b>party</b> will surrender its registration. In some instances, a party will simply happen to cease using the mark in favor of a new brand name, and the registration will lapse. In other cases, the larger company will eventually acquire the smaller.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, unbeknown {{to their}} commanders and each other, and having lost communications, the seven landing craft {{that had been}} {{reported}} missing made for their assigned beaches, determined to press on with the attack. In the end two parties landed, <b>one</b> <b>party</b> consisting of six craft carrying approximately 120 men under Captain R.L Willis landed on the beach opposite Le Petit Berneval {{to the east of}} the battery—Yellow I—while the other, consisting of only one craft of 20 men from No. 6 Troop under Captain Peter Young landed to the west at Yellow II.|$|E

5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which <b>one</b> <b>party</b> gains at the expense of another.|$|E

5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any <b>one</b> <b>party,</b> such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E
5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely <b>one</b> <b>party</b> within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke and Deane is {{the local}} Borough Council and has its offices in the town centre. Elections to the council take place in 3 out of every 4 years. After the latest {{election}} in 2012 and 2 Conservative defections thereafter, the council is not controlled by any <b>one</b> <b>party</b> but the Conservatives are the largest party. As of 2014, the council is compiled of 30 Conservative, 14 Labour, 11 Liberal Democrat, 4 independent and 1 UKIP councillors. The Basingstoke parliamentary constituency was formed under the 1885 Act and is currently served by Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Maria Miller, who was elected in the 2005 general election. In September 2012, Miller was appointed as Secretary of State for Culture, Media & Sport under the Prime Minister's cabinet reshuffle, a position from which she resigned in April 2014.|$|E

Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (0 electoral votes), who ran {{as an independent}} on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was {{a significant part of}} Clinton's success. Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress, the first time <b>one</b> <b>party</b> controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.|$|E
5|$|Final {{adjudication}} of probate found a {{total of}} eight parties or groups of relatives, {{most of whom were}} descended from Moana and her four husbands, as heirs to the Kanaʻina estate splitting {{a total of}} 9 shares, with 2 shares going to <b>one</b> <b>party.</b> The probate records include {{a great deal of information}} from the four years of litigation. A great number of people petitioned the courts to claim title as heirs after the initial 1878 judgement. In the final adjudication, Bernice Pauahi Bishop received two of the nine shares. The remaining seven of the nine shares were divided equally in 1/9th and distributed to Ruth Keelikōlani, Haalilio and Haalelea (namesakes of the historic figures), Kilinahe (Whose grandmother was the older sister of Kanaina's mother and 5 other parties.

5|$|Flotilla is a {{three-dimensional}} simultaneous turn-based strategy space combat video game {{set in a}} randomly generated galaxy. The player and computer-controlled opponents issue orders to their ships, which are carried in a simultaneous and real-time fashion {{over a period of}} 30 seconds. The game then freezes, and the player and opponents issue new orders to their ships, which are again performed for 30 seconds. This process repeats until <b>one</b> <b>party</b> is defeated. Orders are separated into three groups: attack move, flank move and focus fire. An attack move orders the ships to move and fire simultaneously; a flank move increases the ship's speed but deactivates weapons until the ship stops moving; and focus fire increases fire rate but significantly reduces the ship's speed.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the 4th Rifle Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel Harold Barrowclough and positioned {{a distance from}} the west wall of the ramparts, had carried out scouting expeditions to explore the defences. Gradually, the German posts around the fortifications fell to the attacking platoons of the battalion. As on the northern side of the town, machine-gun fire from the ramparts prevented any further advance. <b>One</b> <b>party</b> reached the outer rampart but became pinned down by gunfire for several hours. By midday, the situation had settled into a temporary stalemate. In the afternoon, some German prisoners of war were sent into the town with an invitation to surrender but this approach was rebuffed, as had been a similar attempt earlier that morning.|$|E
5|$|Most {{concurrent}} use proceedings {{result in a}} legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, <b>one</b> <b>party</b> will surrender its {{concurrent use}} claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is that the parties can agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is likely to result from the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|E
5|$|Session Attacks are {{combination}} {{attacks that}} can be triggered by targeting an enemy's weakness. If another party member possesses a Session Skill linking {{to the type of}} attack used, they will automatically perform a pursuit attack, which may then trigger another attack and so on. For example, if <b>one</b> <b>party</b> member attacks with an ice attack, another party member with an Ice-Elec skill will follow up with an electrical attack. Session Attacks may also be carried out by the enemy if they target a party member's weakness. By building up a special meter through attacks, players can earn SP which can be used to trigger Performance attacks, which can be earned through Unity and by completing side-stories. These are called Duo Attacks which are performed by a partner's Mirage. Dual Attacks, on the other hand, can be triggered during a Session Attack to extend the combo at random times. Additionally, party members can learn Ad-lib Performances which may randomly activate while performing certain skills.|$|E

5|$|Small {{numbers of}} AIF {{personnel}} also served in other theatres. Australian {{troops from the}} 1st Australian Wireless Signal Squadron provided communications for British forces during the Mesopotamian Campaign. They participated {{in a number of}} battles, including the Battle of Baghdad in March 1917 and the Battle of Ramadi in September that year. Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Caucasus Front collapsed, leaving Central Asia open to the Turkish Army. A special force, known as Dunsterforce after its commander, Major General Lionel Dunsterville, was formed from hand-picked British officers and NCOs to organise any remaining Russian forces or civilians who were ready to fight the Turkish forces. Some 20 Australian officers served with Dunsterforce in the Caucasus Campaign and <b>one</b> <b>party</b> under Captain Stanley Savige was instrumental in protecting thousands of Assyrian refugees. Australian nurses staffed four British hospitals in Salonika, and another 10 in India.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Parliament Building at Holyrood itself did {{not open}} until October 2004, after lengthy {{construction}} delays and running over budget. The Scottish Parliament has {{a form of}} proportional representation (the additional member system), which normally results in no <b>one</b> <b>party</b> having an overall majority. The pro-independence Scottish National Party led by Alex Salmond achieved this in the 2011 election, winning 69 of the 129 seats available. The success of the SNP in achieving {{a majority in the}} Scottish Parliament {{paved the way for the}} September 2014 referendum on Scottish independence. The majority voted against the proposition, with 55% voting no to independence. More powers, particularly in relation to taxation, were devolved to the Scottish Parliament after the referendum, following cross-party talks in the Smith Commission.|$|E
5|$|Uruguay had a {{very low}} {{population}} density and a weak government. Ordinary citizens were compelled by circumstances to seek the protection of local caudillos—landlords who were either Colorados or Blancos and who used their workers, mostly gaucho horsemen, as private armies. The civil wars between the two factions were brutal. Harsh tactics produced ever-increasing alienation between the groups, and included seizure of land, confiscation of livestock and executions. The antagonism caused by atrocities, along with family loyalties and political ties, made reconciliation unthinkable. European immigrants, who came in great numbers during {{the latter half of}} the nineteenth century, were drawn into <b>one</b> <b>party</b> or the other; both parties had liberal and conservative wings, so the social and political views of newcomers could be reconciled with either. The feuding blocs impeded development of a broadly supported central national administration.|$|E
