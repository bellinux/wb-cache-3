50|$|Experimental cancer studies {{involve the}} {{implantation}} of tumors subcutaneously in mice. Such studies require a simple {{mechanism by which}} to evaluate tumor burden. One such method is to approximate the tumor shape by a spheroid. Two researchers blindly measure the tumor length L and width W, in millimeters, with an <b>ocular</b> <b>micrometer.</b> The depth is not measured and is assumed to equal the width W. The tumor's volume in cubic millimeters is then approximately 0.52W2L.|$|E
40|$|Prey size is an {{important}} factor in food consumption. In studies of feeding ecology, prey items are usually measured individually using calipers or <b>ocular</b> <b>micrometers.</b> Among amphibians and reptiles, there are species that feed on large numbers of small prey items (e. g. ants, termites). This high intake makes it difficult to estimate prey size consumed by these animals. We addressed this problem by developing and evaluating a procedure for subsampling the stomach contents of such predators in order to estimate prey size. Specifically, we developed a protocol based on a bootstrap procedure to obtain a subsample with a precision error of at the most 5 %, with a confidence level of at least 95 %. This guideline should reduce the sampling effort and facilitate future studies on the feeding habits of amphibians and reptiles, and also provide a means of obtaining precise estimates of prey size...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of a three-year study of 105 {{cultures}} of aerobic, non-thermophilic, spore-forming bacteria, a growth-range-tem-perature cell-size relation was incidentally noted, and on two separate occasions at a one-year interval, the rather definite consistency of this concomitancy was observed. Body size of the organisms was always measured in gentian-violet-stained dry preparations with an <b>ocular</b> filar <b>micrometer.</b> The author was impressed with one fact, which seems of ecological significance: Those cultures having lower minimum and maximum growth temperatures are as a rule larger in cell size than those having higher minimum and maximum growth temperatures. A corollary is that those cultures isolated from material incubated at 450 C. and 50 'C. are usually members of smaller sized species than those isolated from materials kept at room temperature. In this connection {{it is interesting to note}} that many cytological investigations of the nuclear phenomena of bacteria have used spore-forming species isolated from cold-blooded animals such as earthworms, insects, frogs, fish and shellfish. The species isolated are large-celled organisms. Table 1 summarizes data collected for those cultures to which species names have been assigned at the time of writing. Thirty-four other cultures included in the study show the same tendency. Those that resemble the Bacillus megatherium or Bacillus mycoides groups have lower optimum and maximum growth temperatures and show larger sizes than others having higher temperature limits of growth...|$|R
40|$|Taxonomic {{investigation}} of four varieties of Mangifera was undertaken in this study. The {{aim was to}} explore the use of foliar micro-anatomical traits in resolving the lingering systematic challenges associated with this fruit crop. Leaves of four varieties of Mangifera (Big-no-fibre, Julie, Opioro and Small-fibre varieties) were collected across various locations in the North Central part of Nigeria. Eighty (80) permanent slides were prepared from the foliar abaxial and adaxial surfaces following standard microscopic practices. Micrometry was carried out using the calibrated <b>ocular</b> and stage <b>micrometers</b> mounted on the compound microscope. From each specimen, thirteen (13) characters were examined and analysed. Mean values of all characters were computed and analysed using the SPSS software (20. 0 versions). Pearson’s correlation matrix was generated to ascertain the association among the characters. Dendrogram was constructed using the Ward’s method to classify the varieties {{on the basis of}} their similarities and differences. From the result obtained, the Julie mango had the longest epidermal cell length of 57 µm (adaxial) followed by the Smallfibre type with 55. 3 µm (abaxial). Stomata and guard cell displayed huge qualitative and quantitative variation among the varieties. Comparison of the abaxial surfaces revealed that the Big-fibre variety had the highest stomatal index (78...|$|R
50|$|Montanari {{was born}} in Modena, studied law in Florence, and {{graduated}} from the University of Salzburg. In 1662 or 1663 he moved to Bologna, where he drew an accurate map of the Moon using an <b>ocular</b> <b>micrometer</b> of his own making. He also made observations on capillarity and other problems in statics, and suggested that the viscosity of a liquid depended on the shape of its molecules. In 1669 he succeeded Giovanni Cassini as astronomy teacher at the observatory of Panzano, near Modena, where one of his duties was to compile an astrological almanac. He did so in 1665, but perpetrated a deliberate hoax by writing the almanac entirely at random, to show that predictions made by chance were {{as likely to be}} fulfilled as those made by astrology. In the period shortly after Galileo Galilei, experimentalists like Montanari were engaged in a battle against the more mystical views of scientists such as Donato Rossetti.|$|E

The results show that there is a correlation between the degree of ovary development and Dufour’s gland activity of workers. The diameter of the gland and the secretory cell activity increased with increasing oocyte size in the ovary. Regressive conditions of the gland were observed, which are probably related to increasing worker age.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{device for}} the {{controlled}} trimming of plastic specimen blocks for light and electron microscopy is described. Many advantages of previously reported instruments together with 1) a {{rack and pinion}} control of knife movement, and 2) a control of rotation of the specimen block at 90 0, 1800, 2700, or 3600 are incorporated. In conjunction with an <b>ocular</b> <b>micrometer,</b> the device allows accurate removal of thin slices during trimming. Several devices and techniques have been described which aid in the trimming of plastic embedded specimen blocks to form "pyramids " (= truncated pyramids) before they are mounted into the microtome (Boyde 1960, Butler 1974, Danon 1961, Guglielmotti 1976, Schneider and Sasaki 1976, Sjostrand 1967). Gorycki (1978) described a "rectangular trimming block " which, {{in conjunction with a}} small mirror mounted on the knife holder of the ultramicrotome, squarely re-trimmed the block face of a preformed truncated pyramid.
