40|$|Introduction Human {{always has}} looked for {{improving}} food production through increasing crops yield. In this path, weeds through competition with crop for environmental factors and inputs {{have reduced the}} quantity and quality of crop products. Competition for nitrogen absorption not only is the most common form of intra-specific competition amongst crop plants, but also is the most popular form of inter-specific competition in the system of weed-crop interference. Therefore, understanding the method of nitrogen absorption and its allocation in competing plants, will be a key tool to improve weed management strategies. Materials and Methods In order to study the effect of sowing method and nitrogen rate on the growth pattern of onion under interference with purple nutsedge, a factorial experiment based on a randomized complete block design was conducted with three replications at the Research Greenhouse of University of Birjand in 2013. The first factor included three sowing methods of onion (seed sowing, <b>onion</b> <b>set</b> and transplanting) and the second factor consisted of three levels of nitrogen (50, 100 and 150 kg N ha- 1, equivalent of 25, 50 and 75 mg N kg- 1 soil) that urea fertilizer with a purity of 46...|$|E

In weed control recent developments aim at increasing capacity and accuracy in mechanical inter-row and intra-row weed control.

For insect control the “Beetle Eater ” a Canadian “vacuum cleaner”, developed to suck up Colorado beetles, is tested for use against the carrot fly and adult cabbage white flies. Reflecting soil covers or coverage of the soil between the crops with other plants can be also quite effective.

40|$|Some organic arable and {{vegetable}} {{farms in the}} Netherlands use cm-precise guidance of machinery to restrict wheel traffic to fixed traffic lanes and to achieve non-trafficked cropping zones with optimized soil structure in between the lanes. Contrary to controlled traffic farming (CTF) the traffic lanes are not yet used for harvesting and primary tillage. Therefore, the system is called a seasonal-controlled traffic farming (SCTF) system. A field experiment was conducted on an organic vegetable farm to reveal soil, crop and emission responses of SCTF with traffic lanes at 3. 15 -m centres compared with conventional random traffic farming (RTF) using low ground pressures in spring from 2002 till 2005. The traffic systems were investigated in the crops green pea (Pisum sativum L.), spinach (Spinacea oleracea L.), onions (Allium cepa L.) and carrots (Daucus carota L.). Compared with RTF, the topsoil structure in the SCTF system improved for the crops sown on the flat but not for carrot grown on ridges. Crop yields increased significantly in green pea, spinach and planted <b>onion</b> <b>sets</b> but not in carrot and direct-sown onion. The available N-min {{at the end of}} the cropping period was not different between systems and, therefore, leaching losses in winter are expected to be the same.

40|$|Yellow dwarf {{of onions}} is a {{transmissible}} virus disease, of the mosaic group. The virus overwinters in the infected onion bulbs and in volunteer onion plants that live over {{winter in the}} fields. It probably is neither seed nor soil borne. Yellow dwarf symptoms are characterized by yellowing and crinkling of the leaves, which become more or less flat and droop over in the advanced stages. Flower stalks of infected mother on ion plants become yellow, twist, and curl and are shorter than normal plants. Masking of yellow dwarf symptoms occurs quite commonly in infected onion plants, and these plants {{are a source of}} inoculum for infecting healthy plants; bulbs from the plants masking symptoms when regrown produce infected plants that show disease symptoms. Plants grown from infected <b>onion</b> <b>sets</b> and those that become infected early in the growing season produce under-developed bulbs of little commercial value. Onion plants having masked infection throughout their growth period produce apparently normal plants and yields. Infected mother onion plants produce normal seed, but the seed yield is about 30 percent less than from healthy plants. Yellow Dwarf is transmissible by artificial inoculation and insect vectors. By artificial inoculations the incubation period is usually about 10 days. Onion bulbs hypodermically inoculated with juice extracted from the fleshy and dry scale leaves of infected onion bulbs failed to show infection. Inoculations made during retarded growth periods either fail to infect the plants or the symptoms are not manifested during the current growth period. Signs of the disease appear when the bulbs of such infected plants are regrown. The virus extracted from yellow dwarf infected onion leaves that mask the symptoms is infective. Yellow dwarf virus was transmitted under controlled conditions by the bean aphid (Aphis rumiscis Linn.), corn leaf aphid (Aphis maidis Fitch.), and the apple grain aphid (Rhopalosiphum prunifoliae Fitch). The yellow dwarf virus was inactivated when the viriferous juice was stored in vitro at 29 ° C. for a period of 112 hours. When infected onion leaves were stored in the open, at 29 ° C. for 100 hours, juice extracted from the leaves was non-infective. The infectivity of the virus was only slightly retarded when viriferous juice was heated 10 minutes at 70 ° C. At 75 ° C. for 10 minutes, 55 percent of the original virulence of the virus was lost. At 80 ° C. for 10 minutes, the virus was inactivated. With 10 -minute exposures the critical thermal point for the yellow dwarf virus lies between 75 and 80 ° C. Exposures as low as - 14 ° C. for 6 hours failed to inactivate yellow dwarf virus. Inoculations with dilutions of 1 - 10, 240 and above failed to infect any of the onion plants. Yellow dwarf virus inoculated into Chinese sacred lily (Narcissus tazetta L.) bulbs, Jonquil (Narcissus jonquilla L.) bulbs and shallots (Allium sativum L.) visibly infected 60, 30 and 90 percent of the plants, respectively. Inoculations with other plant viruses, including mosaic of Chinese sacred lily (Narcissus tazetta L.) and Jonquil (Narcissus jonquilla L.) failed to infect onion plants. Only one (Riverside Sweet Spanish) of thirty-six onion varieties tested seemed to be markedly resistant. The combined effect of indexing all growing stocks of onion bulbs, producing the planting stock of bulbs in areas free from yellow dwarf and roguing out the infected volunteer onions in the fields reduced the percentage of yellow dwarf infection in the district from 40 percent in 1928 to a trace in 1933 and 1934...|$|R

Fill the jar with water and allow the onion to begin root development (3 - 7 days). Mild aeration of the water will assist in the growth of the roots. - Set up another beaker, containing a 10 µ /ml solution of ^ 3 H-thymidine such that there are approximately 10 µc/ml, transfer the onion and its growing roots to the jar containing the radioactive thymidine. - Allow the roots to stay in the radioactive solution for 1 hour at room temperature. - Remove the onion and hold the bulb over a beaker containing water. Rinse the onion roots by dipping several times in the beaker. Transfer the bulb to yet another beaker of aerated water and allow to remain in this beaker for four hours. - Cut off the roots tips and fix in alcohol-acetic acid (3 : 1) overnight. Change the fixative after the first four hours. - Wash the roots in water for several minutes and place in 1 N HCl at 60 ° C for 12 minutes. - Stain the root tips with the Feulgen Reaction as given in Steps 3. b- 3. e of [Exercise 2. 5]([URL] - Dehydrate the root tips, embed in paraffin and section at 10 - 15 microns. Mount on microscope slides. - Deparaffinize in xylol and rehydrate sections by passing first through a series of alcohols and finally in two changes of water. - In a dark room melt some liquid autoradiographic emulsion at a water bath at 42 ° C. - Place two slides back-to-back and dip slowly into the melted emulsion. Remove, allow to drain and place in an appropriate light-proof container and allow them to dry in a vertical position. - When dry, place the slides into an opaque slide box containing drierite. Wrap in aluminum foil and place in a refrigerator. - The slides must stay in the refrigerator until a proper exposure has been made. This can vary from 5 days to over two weeks. After one week, a trial slide should be developed using Steps 15 and 16 below. Examine the slide at 10 X with a bright field microscope and look for the presence of black silver grains located over the cells. A correct exposure is determined by the appearance of silver grains over the cells, but few or no silver grains located in areas without cells. If the appearance of the trial slide is correct, then the remainder should be processed immediately. Repeat an additional trial slide in 2 - 3 days, and repeat every three days thereafter until an adequate exposure is obtained. - Develop the autoradiogram emulsion in the darkroom as follows: - Develop in Kodak D- 19 Developer at 20 ° C for 3 minutes. - Wash for 10 seconds in distilled water. - Fix with Kodak Fixer for 3 minutes. - Wash in running water for 15 minutes. - Dehydrate by placing in 95 % alcohol for 3 minutes. - Place in 100 % alcohol for 3 minutes. - Clear in two changes of xylol for 3 minutes each. - Mount coverslip with Permount. - Draw and label the autoradiograms in the space provided on the following page. Calculate the percent of cells actively undergoing DNA synthesis during the time of exposure to radioactive thymidine. Note that the tissue and the silver grains are in different planes of focus and you will need to constantly switch focus from one plane to the other. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") Drawing of thymidine incorporation ### Notes This procedure involves the incorporation of a radioactive substance into a cell, and subsequent detection of that material {{through the use of a}} photographic emulsion. The primary source used for cell biology is an organic molecule containing tritium, the radioactive form of hydrogen. Radioactive carbon, phosphorous and iodine are occasionally utilized, but tritium has inherently more resolution than any of the others. Tritiated thymidine (^ 3 H-thymidine) is often used, for example, to study the synthesis and location of DNA. Thymidine is a soluble base which is specific to DNA. It is incorporated into the macromolecular structure of DNA during synthesis and replication of the chromosomes. Upon fixing the cells for standard histological examination, the DNA molecules (with their incorporated, radioactive, thymidine) are precipitated or cross-linked as permanent parts of the cell. Un-incorporated thymidine is removed from the cell, as it remains soluble and is disposed of in the tissue washing procedures. When the tissues are sectioned and applied to a glass slide, they will contain radioactive nuclei, but only those nuclei that were in the S phase of division during the exposure of the cells to ^ 3 H-thymidine. Radioactive sources can not be detected directly, but if a photographic emulsion is applied directly over the section, it will become exposed by the radioactive source. When the photographic emulsion is subsequently processed (i. e. developed), the exposed portions of the emulsion will contain reduced silver grains in direct proportion to the amount of radiation being given off beneath it (in the nuclei of our example). If the exposed, developed slides are now examined with a microscope, there will be two layers of interest. Focusing the microscope on the tissue itself will give a view of the tissue and cell architecture. If the focus of the microscope is moved upward, however, the cells will go out of focus, exactly as the photographic emulsion comes into focus. Within the emulsion will be areas of reduced silver grains and clear areas containing no silver grains. By alternately focusing on the tissue and the emulsion, those nuclei that are radioactive can be readily identified. If desired, the number of silver grains could be counted to give a quantitative measure of ^ 3 H- thymidine incorporation (and thus DNA synthesis), although this is a rather complex procedure to control, with any significant accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Genetic studies {{aimed at}} onion {{improvement}} {{have been limited}} because of outcrossing, high heterozygosity and a very large genome size {{with a high level}} of repetitive DNA. Onion bulb initiation is photoperiod-dependent, which places a significant barrier to adapting new varieties for growth at different latitudes. In comparison to photoperiodic regulation of flowering, relatively little is known about genetic regulation of the bulbing process. This project aims to test the hypothesis that the genetic regulation of bulb formation in response to daylength is analogous to the daylength regulation of flowering and to identify genes involved in daylength adaptation in <b>onion.</b> A comprehensive <b>set</b> of developmental, diurnal and spatial mRNA and quantitative expression experiments were carried out to investigate the bulbing response. Bulbing ratios were used to measure the bulbing response of onion plants and the reversibility of the bulbing process under long day (LD) and short day (SD) conditions. RNA-Seq analysis provided a large number of differentially expressed transcripts in onion in response to daylength. Five FT and three COL genes were identified in onion including two novel COL sequences. AcFT 1 was expressed in LD, which might induce bulb formation, while AcFT 4 was expressed in SD, which might inhibit bulb formation. AcFT 5 and AcFT 6 were expressed in LD and might also be involved in bulb formation itself. FKF 1, GI and COL 2 showed good diurnal expression patterns consistent with photoperiod sensing and regulation of FT 1.

40|$|Sugar {{levels in}} Beta vulgaris leaves were {{increased}} by heat-girdling the petiole and returning {{the plant to}} the controlled-environment chamber for 10 and 34 hours. After 10 hours, sucrose influx into the treated leaves {{was similar to the}} controls, although sucrose levels increased from 2. 1 to 5. 3 micromoles per milligram chlorophyll. However, after a 34 -hour treatment, sucrose levels increased from 2. 1 to 11. 5 micromoles per milligram chlorophyll. In this instance, sucrose influx decreased relative to the untreated controls. Decreasing sugar levels by DCMU treatment resulted in a small stimulation of sucrose influx. A similar DCMU treatment applied to leaves of Allium cepa also resulted in an increase in sucrose influx. However, in A. cepa we could not attribute this increase to a lowering of sugar levels, as the kinetic profiles obtained from control leaves did not vary from each other throughout the day, despite considerable changes in sugar levels. Additionally, it appeared that sucrose uptake in <b>onion</b> may be <b>set</b> at some point and remains invariant throughout the day. Similar studies were also conducted on discs cut from mature leaves of Spinacia oleracea var America. Between 1 and 8 hours after the onset of the photoperiod, the sucrose content of the spinach leaves increased from 2. 6 to 9. 3 micromoles per milligram chlorophyll. A comparison of the kinetic profiles obtained from leaf discs, taken at these times, indicated that sucrose uptake was not influenced by these changes in internal sugar levels. The relationship between the above findings and `trans' inhibition of exogenous sucrose uptake is discussed. Although intermediate changes in sugar levels in sugar beet leaves did not appear to affect sucrose influx, autoradiographic studies revealed that these changes dramatically affected the partitioning of exogenously supplied [14 C]sucrose. Our results indicate that while intermediate changes in internal sugar levels have little effect on sucrose influx across the plasmalemma, they may dramatically affect partitioning between the phloem and the mesophyll vacuole...|$|R
