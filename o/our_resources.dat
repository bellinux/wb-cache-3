25|$|The John W. Graham Library traces {{its origins}} to 1828, when John Strachan secured a {{collection}} of some four hundred books from the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge to stock the library of the fledgling King's College. The modern Graham Library is located in Devonshire House, which also contains the Munk School of Global Affairs, occupying a heritage building renewed for the 21st-century, with 200,000 volumes, convenient technological resources, and fine study spaces. The Library serves primarily Trinity's undergraduate students in the Faculty of Arts and Science, the graduate Divinity students and faculty of Trinity and Wycliffe Colleges, and the greater University of Toronto and Anglican Church communities who seek <b>our</b> <b>resources.</b> Subject strengths reflect the academic programs and interests of the two colleges: international relations, ethics, literature in English, philosophy, theology, Anglican church history, biblical studies.|$|E
25|$|The War Committee met (3 November 1916) without Robertson, so Lloyd George could, in Hankey’s words “air {{his views}} freely unhampered by the {{presence}} of that old dragon Robertson”. He complained that the Allies had not achieved any definite success, that the Germans had recovered the initiative, had conquered most of Romania, had increased her forces in the East (after increased mobilisation the German Army had increased in size from 169 ½ divisions on 1 June to 197 divisions (of which 70 were in the East, up from 47 ½ on 1 June)) and still had 4 million men in reserve. On this occasion Asquith backed him and the committee’s conclusion, which was neither printed nor circulated, was that “The offensive on the Somme, if continued next year, was not likely to lead to decisive results, and that the losses might make too heavy a drain on <b>our</b> <b>resources</b> having regard to the results to be anticipated.” It was agreed to consider offensives in other theatres. The ministers again (7 November) discussed, after Robertson had left the room, the plan to send Robertson to a conference in Russia (all except possibly McKenna were in favour) and a further inter-Allied conference to upstage the forthcoming conference of generals at Chantilly. Robertson rejected the idea as “the Kitchener dodge” and was angry at the discussion behind his back and, concerned that Lloyd George wanted to “play hanky panky”, refused to go.|$|E

The team felt that dividing focus and resources across both a single-player and an online multiplayer mode {{would be less}} efficient. When questioned {{about the lack of}} an online multiplayer mode, Öjerfors explained that the decision was simple. [...] "If we could take every bit of energy and sweat the studio has and pour all that into the single-player campaign, it gives us the resources to make something very, very cool, compared to if we would also have to divert some of <b>our</b> <b>resources</b> to making multiplayer."

500|$|Despite the M2B's lack {{of success}} Herd said of the team, [...] "Everyone was ten times more {{determined}} to do better the following year." [...] On {{the design of the}} car he reflected that, [...] "our emphasis tended to be more on the elegance of the chassis structure rather than on the design of a really quick racing car" [...] and that, [...] "we ... tended to go towards technical ingenuity and bullshit rather than racewinning engineering". Team member and later manager of the organisation Teddy Mayer said, [...] "Our main problems were with the choice of the Ford engine." [...] Bruce McLaren's personal secretary and author Eoin Young concurs. The winners of the 1966 drivers' and constructors' championships, Jack Brabham and his eponymous team, used a Repco-modified and badged Oldsmobile engine. It produced approximately 290bhp – less than the Ford – but its light weight and reliability rendered it effective. Despite having used the Oldsmobile in sports racing cars, the McLaren team discounted it. Afterwards, Mayer said, [...] "We considered it, but the kind of modifications which Repco did were well beyond <b>our</b> <b>resources,</b> and I doubt very much if we could have done any more with it than we did with the Indy Ford." ...|$|E
