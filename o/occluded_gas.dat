40|$|The Bureau of Mines has {{developed}} two experimental designs {{for determining the}} volumes and relative proportions of the various gas species, particularly methane (ch 4), occluded in rock salt. To date, the rock salt samples analyzed have been relatively small (400 - to 1, 000 -gram) grab samples from Louisiana gulf coast domal salt mines. The results obtained are comparable to results in Polish domal salt mines, in terms of <b>occluded</b> <b>gas</b> volumes per mass of rock salt. The notable difference between the Louisiana and Polish <b>occluded</b> <b>gas</b> mixtures is in the relative proportions of the individual gas species. The two methods used by the Bureau are ball- mill crushing and dissolution. Of the two, the dissolution method {{appears to be more}} versatile because it can be performed in situ. The relevance and applicability of data on the <b>occluded</b> <b>gas</b> contents of rock salt are dependent on sample size, sample collection method, geologic context of the sample, and the correlation with gas emissions that occur as a result of mining-induced fractures and pressure differentials.

The method, which is portable and field worthy, provides results in 5 min or less and {{does not require a}} laboratory environment or specially trained personnel to obtain meaningful results. The results can be used to identify gas-enriched zones, and thus may aid mine operators in production planning or ventilation design. The test method is based on the relationship between gas content and the acoustic response of salt samples as they are dissolved in water. The relationship is defined by an equation, and the results are repeat- able. The equation was derived by testing a series of rock salt samples collected from domal salt mines in Louisiana...|$|E

40|$|The Conductivity Sensor {{designed}} {{for use in the}} Node 3 Water Processor Assembly (WPA) was based on the existing Space Shuttle application for the fuel cell water system. However, engineering analysis has determined that this sensor design is potentially sensitive to two-phase fluid flow (gadliquid) in microgravity. The source for this sensitivity is the fact that gas bubbles will become lodged between the sensor probe and the wall of the housing without the aid of buoyancy in l-g. Once gas becomes lodged in the housing, the measured conductivity will be offset based on the volume of <b>occluded</b> <b>gas.</b> A development conductivity sensor was flown on the NASA Microgravity Plan to measure the offset, which was determined to range between 0 and 50 %.

40|$|Context: Shear wave {{velocity}} tests (Vs) {{are commonly used}} to estimate the increase in resistance of explosive densified soils. In some historical cases, Vs tests performed after the soil improvement process do not show {{a significant increase in}} soil resistance, even though the soil surface sits more than 0. 50 m. It is believed that this response is due to the presence of gas on the soil mass. Method: This paper presents the results of monotonic triaxial tests performed on samples of dense gaseous sandy soils to evaluate the effect of <b>occluded</b> <b>gas</b> on the response to the shear {{wave velocity}} in densified sands with explosives. For sand sampling, it was collected from a loose sand deposit located in South Carolina, USA. These samples were densified in-situ with explosives, and consolidated to the in-situ effective stress conditions, which are considered representative in the conditions of effort at the moment of the densification with explosives. Results: Triaxial tests were performed under global non-drained conditions. The results of these tests show that gas causes the shear wave velocity values obtained for the gaseous sands to approximate the shear wave velocity values obtained in the saturated samples tested under drained conditions. In addition, behavior tends to be more pronounced as the soil is denser. Conclusions: These response may offer some insights as to why the shear wave velocity does not increase significantly in densified soils with explosives, even though the density increases considerably...|$|E

Using ice crystallography, stable O-H isotopes and gas composition, this thesis provides new clues {{to the understanding of}} ice wedge formation and filling process in the Yukon Territory and Alaska. An improved extraction line and mass spectrometry technique were used 10 analyze the gas composition of ice bubbles (O 2, N 2 and Ar). Conclusions from this study infer that climatic conditions may influence the source of infilling during ice wedge growth. Wet and dry environments have result in two different signatures in ice wedges. The Vault Creek tunnel ice wedges in Alaska, dated to the late Pleistocene, a cold and dry period, preserve stable O-H isotope and gas compositions similar to those expected for ice formed by snow densification. On the other hand, ice wedges from the Old Crow region, dated to the late Holocene, preserved isotopic and gas compositions more similar to those expected for ice formed by the freezing of liquid water. In some cases, the results from the <b>occluded</b> <b>gases</b> (O 2, N 2 and Ar) showed low oxygen concentration and high delta 18 O values, indicating respiration prior to formation.

40|$|Reprinted from THE PHYSICAL REVIEW, Vol. 37, No. 5, pp. 634 - 637, March 1, 1931 STRAIN AND DIAMAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY [...] ABSTRACT [...] The {{magnetic}} susceptibility of copper and, silver wires has been {{measured by the}} Gouy method before and after various annealing processes. Also, the susceptibility has been measured before and after straining specimens beyond the elastic limit, the strains being either twists or stretches. The susceptibilities are found to he increased, {{by as much as}} 20 percent for copper and 3 percent for silver by annealing at red heat for 15 minutes in an atmosphere of CO 2. This increase is probably due to release of <b>occluded</b> <b>gases</b> or to oxidation or recombination of impurities. Straining the specimens beyond the elastic limit is found to produce no measurable change of susceptibility. Francis Bitter has observed a large effect due to straining these metals beyond the elastic limit. The reason for Bitter's results is not clear, but it is pointed out that no effect is to be expected in copper, at least, because crystals of this metal are isotropic magnetically and have no observable magnetostriction. THE MOBILITY OF POSITIVE IONS IN FLAMES [...] ABSTRACT [...] The mobility was calculated from measured values of the current density, cathode drop of potential, and the thickness of the layer at the cathode in which the potential varies rapidly. The excess of ionization over recombination in the layer was assumed to be proportional to (1 â€”x/x 0 m, where x is the distance from the cathode, xi the thickness of the layer at the cathode, and m is a constant. J. J. Thomson supposed that in = 0, and P. E. Boucher took in = 1. The value calculated for the mobility depends on the value assumed for m. The results give, with m 2, a value of 1. 8; with m = 3, a value of 1. 07 cm/sec. per volt/cm for the mobility. It is found that the mobility is the same for salts of Rb, Cs, and K, and that it does not depend on the concentration of the salt. A small increase of mobility with electric intensity is indicated by the results...|$|R

Crushing the rock produced up to order-of-magnitude increases in the abundances of Ar, Kr, and Xe relative to the millimeter-sized chips of 60015 previously analyzed. Contrary to expectations for atmospheric contamination, high temperatures (above 1000 C) were necessary to remove about 75 % of the trapped Kr and Xe, and the rare-gas elemental abundance ratios differed from those in terrestrial samples believed to have <b>occluded</b> atmospheric <b>gases.</b> It is concluded, on the basis of similar temperature-release profiles and elemental-fractionation patterns, that the trapped Xe observed in all these 60015 analyses is atmospheric contamination. Such a conclusion cannot unequivocally be drawn for other lunar rocks containing terrestrial-like Xe, but the present results demonstrate that arguments based on high extraction temperatures and elemental abundance ratios cannot be useful to rule out rare-gas atmospheric contamination in such samples...|$|R

40|$|Apple slice {{texture and}} quality is {{affected}} by a diverse array of preharvest, postharvest and processing factors. The study described in this thesis had two primary objectives: 1) to investigate factors that influence {{the effectiveness of the}} vacuum infiltration process and thereby identify ways to enhance infiltration in difficult-to-infiltrate fruit. 2) to ascertain the effects of a range of pre- and post- harvest factors including cultivar, temperature, edible surface coatings and calcium treatments on fresh and processed apple texture and quality. Vacuum infiltration is used to replace the 8 - 36 % of tissue volume made up by <b>occluded</b> <b>gases</b> in the commercial production of solid-pack canned apple slices. This removal: reduces textural degradation caused by thermal expansion of these gases; prevents can corrosion and off-flavour development caused by residual oxygen; and ensures that relative density of the tissue is increased sufficiently to achieve prescribed can fill weights. Vacuum infiltration is often incomplete for fruit produced in cold growing seasons and also with immature fruit. In this study, level of infiltration achieved in apple slices was affected by pre-condition of the tissue (eg. maturity, porosity, whole fruit density) and by variables that relate directly to the vacuum infiltration process (eg. vacuum time, absorption time, solution temperature). Infiltration was enhanced in fruit taken from later harvests and in fruit pre-stored for a short period at 20 Â°C. Key aspects of the vacuum infiltration process were investigated and the relationships between vacuum time, absorption time, and slice relative density were characterised. Reduced vacuum levels were detrimental to liquid impregnation. To maximise infiltration in 'Braeburn' fruit required: high vacuum levels (preferably > 95 kPa), vacuum times of approx 2 min, and absorption times > 6 min. Infiltration was enhanced by heating the infiltrating solution. The texture and quality of solid-pack canned apple slices is to a large extent determined by the quality of the raw product. 'Braeburn', 'Fuji' and 'Granny Smith' apples varied quite markedly in terms of textural quality, storage potential, tolerance of ambient temperatures and ultimately in their response to processing. In general, fresh and processed apple texture declined with increasing fresh fruit storage temperature and duration. Application of edible surface coatings enhanced texture and reduced free-juice content of canned slices. The level of benefit achieved varied considerably with cultivar and storage temperature and, to a more limited extent, grower line and coating concentration. Calcium application during the pre- or post-harvest phases had little effect on processed slice texture, but in some cases free-juice volume was reduced. The interrelationships between the variables under study are discussed and a conceptual model presented that describes the effects of key postharvest variables on fresh and processed fruit texture...|$|R
40|$|Viscoelastic {{wheat flour}} doughs are renowned {{for their ability}} to produce high quality aerated bread products.

The ability of these bubbles to resist failure and remain stable throughout the proofing and baking process is critical to final bread structure and volume. Understanding these factors is important when creating the distinct structural and textural characteristics that consumers desire in baked products. In this study, a method was established for using X-ray microtomography (XMT) to study the microstructure of proving dough as well as bread made from three very different wheat flours.

40|$|Mixing of {{the dough}} is the {{critical}} control point in the breadmaking process. Mixing aerates the dough and develops its rheology such that inflation and coalescence of the bubbles proceed in the correct fashion so as to create the desired bread structure and texture. The amount and rate of energy imparted to the dough during mixing affects both aeration and rheology, but these two facets of dough mixing have seldom been studied together. This paper investigates the effects of mixer speed and work input in a Tweedy-type mixer on the aeration {{of the dough}} and its rheology, using dough density measurements and bubble inflation rheometry. Increasing mixing speed {{had little effect on}} the gas-free dough density, but increased the void fraction of <b>gas</b> <b>occluded</b> in doughs made from either strong or weak flour.

40|$|The {{aeration}} and {{rheological properties}} of bread doughs prepared from strong and weak flours at various mixing speeds and work inputs in a high-speed laboratory-scale mixer were investigated. Dough aeration was quantified {{in terms of}} gas-free dough density and gas void fraction using density measurements, while dough rheology was characterized {{in terms of the}} strain hardening index, failure strain and failure stress under large biaxial extensional deformation using the SMS Dough Inflation System. Increasing mixing speed had little effect on the gas-free dough density but increased the void fraction of <b>gas</b> <b>occluded</b> in dough. As mixing progressed, the gas-free dough density initially increased, more dramatically for the weak than the strong flour, before reaching a plateau at approximately 30 kJ kgâˆ’ 1 energy input. The gas content tended to increase over the range of work inputs tested. For both flours, the strain hardening index, failure strain and failure stress increased with work input initially, followed by a decrease. The absolute values were all higher for the strong flour, while maximum values and the work input at which the maximum occurred depended on the mixing speed.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the activity of Comet C/ 1995 O 1 (Hale-Bopp) with a thermophysical nucleus model that does not rely {{on the existence of}} amorphous ice is presented. Our approach incorporates recent observations allowing to constrain important parameters that control cometary activity. The model accounts for heat conduction, heat advection, gas diffusion, sublimation, and condensation in a porous iceÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚ï¿½dust matrix with moving boundaries. Erosion due to surface sublimation of water ice leads to a moving boundary. The movement of the boundary is modeled by applying a temperature remapping technique which allows us to account for the loss in the internal energy of the eroded surface material. These kind of problems are commonly referred to as Stefan problems. The model takes into account the diurnal rotation of the nucleus and seasonal effects due to the strong obliquity of Hale-Bopp as reported by Jorda et al. (Jorda, L., Rembor, K., Lecacheux, J., Colom, P., Colas, F., Frappa, E., Lara, L. M. [1997]. Earth Moon Planets 77, 167 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚ï¿½ 180). Only bulk sublimation of water and CO ice are considered without further assumptions such as amorphous ices with certain amount of <b>occluded</b> CO <b>gas.</b> Confined and localized activity patterns are investigated following the reports of Lederer and Campins (Lederer, S. M., Campins, H. [2002]. Earth Moon Planets 90, 381 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚ï¿½ 389) about the chemical heterogeneity of Hale-Bopp and of BockelÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â©e-Morvan et al.

Astrophys. 505, 825 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚ï¿½ 843) about a strong CO source at a latitude of 20. The best fit to the observations of Biver et al. (Biver, N. et al. [2002]. Earth Moon Planets 90, 5 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚ï¿½ 14) is obtained with a low thermal conductivity of 0. 01 Wm 1 K 1. This is in agreement with recent results of the Deep Impact mission to 9 P/Tempel 1 (Groussin, O., AÃƒÂ¢Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚ï¿½Hearn, M. F., Li, J. -Y., Thomas, P. C., Sunshine, J. M., Lisse, C. M., Meech, K.

The water production curve matches the production rates well from 4 AU pre-perihelion to the outgoing leg while the model does not reproduce so well the water production beyond 4 AU pre-perihelion.

The N- 2 /O- 2 ratio we observe is {{much closer to the}} atmospheric value. This has new implications for the interpretation of gas distributions in ice sheets. Raman spectroscopic scans to determine the N- 2 /O- 2 ratios on different planes through a clathrate, in which the two axes of the scans are perpendicular to each other, give no indication of fractionation effects on the N- 2 /O- 2 concentrations within a clathrate specimen. The frequency shift of the N- 2 and O- 2 peaks due to decomposition of a clathrate to an air bubble is shown qualitatively. From their peak integrals there is no indication of different retransformation rates to air bubbles between the oxygen and the nitrogen contents of clathrates. In air bubbles resulting from clathrate decomposition, the N- 2 /O- 2 ratio shows similar values to those observed in clathrates and present atmospheric values.

In acquisition, {{it has been shown}} that gravity coring provides samples of equal quality to piston coring, at greater safety and lower cost; while the best preservation is freezing to- 80 Â°C, since bactericides do not always penetrate clay samples and will contaminate at least the solvent extracts. The advantages of analysing <b>occluded</b> and adsorbed <b>gases</b> instead of just headspace gas have also been shown. Regarding analyses of liquid hydrocarbons, the two most critical choices involve i) the bulk assessment of the total extract, and ii) the GC-MS analyses of the extract, and these techniques are the focus of this work. Bulk analysis of the extract usually involves performing both gas chromatography (GC) and total scanning fluorescence (TSF). The GC method shows in chromatogram form, directly and unequivocally, the compounds present in the sample and show if biodegradation has occurred. This analysis is indisputably necessary to perform, not only due to its ability to show at a glance the type of hydrocarbons present, but also, when the extraction is performed quantitatively, to give the amounts of thermogenic hydrocarbons as opposed to those from recent organic matter. TSF is rather an 'indirect' method, targeting the aromatic compounds, and relying on the fluorescing properties of these under different wavelengths. By comparison with reference samples containing known types of hydrocarbons the emission data are qualitatively interpreted. It is shown here, however, that the TSF results do not consistently agree with the GC analyses, which are considered as the benchmark. The disagreement locally can be quite marked; e. g., TSF indicating thermogenic hydrocarbons in barren samples and vice versa. The value of performing TSF is then strongly questioned, especially as GC must in any case be performed on all samples...|$|R

The past origin of CO 2 is better comprehended when studying concomitantlythe evolution of its stable carbon isotope composition, as it is affected by various frac-tionation processes in and between carbon reservoirs. The LGGE dry extraction method of <b>gases</b> <b>occluded</b> in ice was used in combinationwith a new instrumental setup to investigate the CO 2 mixing ratio and its stable car-bon isotope composition (delta 13 CO 2) in air from the last deglaciation at the EPICADome Concordia site (Antarctica). The resolution of our results (250 years in average) allows us to divide Termination I (TI) into four sub-periods, each representing differ-ent climatic features at the Earth surface (Heinrich I, BÃ¸lling/Ã…llerÃ¸d, Antarctic ColdReversal, Younger Dryas). We observe that CO 2 and delta 13 CO 2 are not correlated. Delta 13 CO 2 shows positive and negative excursions associated with changes in thegrowth rate of atmospheric CO 2. This illustrates the dynamic character of the carboncycle and its coupling to climate change during the deglaciation. The use of two car-bon cycle box models highlight oceanic mechanisms as the major contributors to theCO 2 evolution during these periods of TI, and the terrestrial biosphere for the warmBÃ¸lling/Ã…llerÃ¸d event.

And then, occluded hydrocarbon evolution models were established for five types of source rocks (sapropelic, sapropelic prone hybrid, humic prone hybrid, humic and coal).

In additional animals (5 per group), lung tissue was frozen 24 hours after reperfusion and assessed for myeloperoxidase activity as a measurement of neutrophil migration into the graft and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances to quantify lipid peroxidation. Results: Graft function as assessed by arterial PO 2 in recipients treated with sCR 1 sLeX was superior not only to that of controls (383 Â± 53 vs 56 Â± 7 mm Hg, P =. 000095) but also to that of animals treated with sCR 1 (243 Â± 45 mm Hg, P =. 031). This improvement was confirmed by significant reduction of neutrophil migration (0. 33 Â± 0. 05 vs control, 1. 0 Â± 0. 09 Î”OD/mg/min, P =. 0000024) and lipid peroxidation (6. 2 Â± 0. 38 vs control, 10. 6 Â± 0. 54 pmol/g, P =. 00021). Conclusions: Our data indicate that combined inhibition of complement activation and leukocyte adhesion with sCR 1 sLeX reduces reperfusion injury significantly and that both mechanisms are effectively inhibited in this model.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryHulya DoganViscoelastic {{wheat flour}} doughs are renowned {{for their ability}} to produce high quality aerated bread products. Dough {{exhibits}} extremely complex rheological properties which makes it capable of <b>occluding</b> and retaining <b>gas</b> cells. The ability of these bubbles to resist failure and remain stable throughout the proofing and baking process is critical to final bread structure and volume. Understanding these factors is important when creating the distinct structural and textural characteristics that consumers desire in baked products. In this study, a method was established for using X-ray microtomography (XMT) to study the microstructure of proving dough as well as bread made from three very different wheat flours. Doughs were prepared according to AACC Method 10 - 10 B optimized straight-dough bread-making method. Sections from unproofed (0 min), underproofed (20 min) and optimally proofed (40 min) doughs were carefully cut and frozen at â€“ 80 Â°C. Baked loaves were also prepared following standard test bake procedures. Small specimens were cut from two locations of both the proofed and baked loaves prior to microstructural analysis. A total of 96 dough and bread samples were scanned using a high resolution desktop X-ray micro-CT system Skyscan 1072 (Skyscan, Belgium) consisting of an X-ray tube, an X-ray detector and a CCD-camera. X-ray images were obtained from 137 rotation views through 180 Â° of rotation. Hundreds of reconstructed cross sectional images were analyzed using CTAn (v. 1. 7) software. 3 -D analysis of the bubbles indicated that average dough void fractions increased dramatically over proof time from 30. 9 % for the unproofed dough (0 min) to 62. 0 % and 74. 5 % for the underproofed (20 min) and optimally proofed (40 min) doughs respectively. Oven spring caused further expansion in the baked loaves which increased average void fraction to 84. 3 %. Gas cell size distributions were largely skewed to the right and shifted in that same direction as processing time increased. Differences in gas cell size seen among flour varieties were largely due to variations {{in the size of the}} largest cells caused by coalescence...|$|R
40|$|Surface geochemistry, the {{measurement}} of near-surface hydrocarbons, {{has been used by}} the petroleum industry for more than 80 years to explore for subsurface petroleum deposits. The fact that hydrocarbons generated deep in the sedimentary section from thermally mature organic rich rocks can migrate to the near-surface in measurable concentrations is well documented but the methods currently used by industry to extract and measure these near-surface migrated hydrocarbons have not been rigorously tested. One of the key goals in this PhD research effort is to determine the best procedures to remove migrated hydrocarbon gases (C 1 to C 5) from near-surface marine sediments with minimal fractionation based on laboratory experiments and field calibration studies. A second key goal is evaluate procedures to evaluate nearsurface sediment gasoline range hydrocarbons (C 5 to C 10). The middle boiling point range hydrocarbons have been largely ignored in surface geochemistry and could contain valuable information to determine subsurface petroleum generation, migration, and entrapment. Lastly, it is extremely important to understand how best to evaluate and integrate the near-surface gas and gasoline range measurements into an overall understanding of the petroleum charge system, specifically the source, maturation, and migration elements for evaluating prospect charge. Empirical observations from the global surface geochemical database and laboratory experiments demonstrate that several of the surface geochemical methods currently used by industry do not accurately remove the nearsurface migrated gases thus providing biased and incorrect results. The acid extraction (Horvitz adsorbed method), microdesorption, and ball mill (<b>occluded)</b> bound sediment <b>gas</b> extraction methods all provided gas compositions and isotopic ratios significantly different than the charge gases. The extracted bound gases contain elevated wet gas (C 2 to C 5) relative to the charge gases. These results are similar to what was noted in the global surface geochemistry database. In addition, the laboratory results indicate we do not fully understand sediment bound gas process. Thus the bound gases may not properly reflect the composition or isotopic ratios of the migrated hydrocarbons. Three interstitial sediment gas methods were examined as part of my research efforts, two canned headspace with different preparation and laboratory procedures; and a new extraction method designated as the disrupter. One of the headspace methods and the new disrupter gas extraction method provided gas compositions and isotopic ratios very similar to the charge gases. One of the headspace can methods provided highly variable gas compositions due to can leakage and preparation procedures. In general the interstitial hydrocarbon gases when properly collected and evaluated can provide critical information on the presence of mature source rock at depth. The gasoline range plus hydrocarbons are rarely examined in surface geochemical studies due to the great difficulty in extracting this boiling point range of hydrocarbons. The SPME method, in conjunction with the disrupter chamber, has been shown from laboratory evaluation to accurately remove and reflect gasoline range hydrocarbons in marine sediments. Choosing the most efficient fiber, optimal boundary conditions, and limitations is very critical. Early field testing has shown the gasoline range hydrocarbons are heavily bacterially altered in most near-surface marine. Despite these issues, the gasoline range plus hydrocarbons have great potential in determining the source and maturity of the migrated hydrocarbons in near-surface marine sediments. Thus near-surface sediment gases and gasoline range hydrocarbons, when properly collected and extracted, can be used as indicators of subsurface generation and entrapment as shown in the observation with the global surface geochemical database and laboratory experiments.
