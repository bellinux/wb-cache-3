50|$|According to the Cochrane {{review on}} vitamin C {{and the common}} cold, 1 g/day or more of vitamin C does not {{influence}} common cold incidence in the general community. However, in five randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials with participants who were under heavy short-term physical stress (three of the trials were with marathon runners), vitamin C halved the incidence <b>of</b> <b>colds.</b> In the dose of 1 g/day or more, vitamin C shortened the duration <b>of</b> <b>colds</b> in adults by 8% and in children by 18%. Vitamin C also decreased the severity <b>of</b> <b>colds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Vitamin C has not {{decreased}} the frequency <b>of</b> <b>colds</b> {{in the general}} population, but it has halved the frequency <b>of</b> <b>colds</b> in people under heavy short-term physical stress.

5|$|Modern {{methods of}} {{producing}} lager were pioneered by Gabriel Sedlmayr the Younger, who perfected dark brown lagers at the Spaten Brewery in Bavaria, and Anton Dreher, who began brewing a lager (now known as Vienna lager), probably of amber-red colour, in Vienna in 1840–1841. With improved modern yeast strains, most lager breweries use only short periods <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> storage, typically 1–3 weeks.|$|E

5|$|The only useful ways {{to reduce}} the spread <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> viruses are {{physical}} measures such as hand washing and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Vaccination has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly. Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, thus, highly improbable.|$|E
40|$|Background: Cold and {{influenza}} {{transmission is}} a serious public health issue for universities. This case study describes a coordinated social marketing campaign that incorporated health messages and products. It was designed to motivate behavior change {{to prevent the spread}} <b>of</b> <b>colds</b> and influenza on a university campus. Methods: The aims of this multi-component intervention were to raise awareness of the importance of individual behavior in preventing the spread <b>of</b> <b>colds</b> and flu and to encourage staff and students to adopt three simple habits: hand washing, cough or sneeze in sleeve, and stay at home if sick. A repeated, cross-sectional survey design assessed the following pre- and post-campaign: salience <b>of</b> <b>colds</b> and flu; perceived severity of, and susceptibility to, colds and flu; beliefs about effective prevention strategies; and engagement in preventative behaviors. Campaign message and product recall were assessed post-campaign. Results: Campaign message recall was high (over 80...|$|R

40|$|Investigations of the {{relationship}} between symptoms of the natural common <b>cold</b> and administration <b>of</b> supplementary vitamin C must record and take into account the following factors: 1.

Days of absence from work provide a general measure arising from cold disability. 1 Integrated morbidity 2 is defined as the product <b>of</b> incidence <b>of</b> <b>colds,</b> and severity <b>of</b> individual <b>colds.</b> The two values for incidence and integrated morbidity are not independent of one another.
