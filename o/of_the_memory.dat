5|$|A popular {{approach}} {{to improve performance}} {{is to create a}} memory pool-based allocator. Instead of allocating memory every time an item is inserted or removed from a container, a large block of memory (the memory pool) is allocated beforehand, possibly at the startup of the program. The custom allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a pointer to memory from the pool. Actual deallocation of memory can be deferred until the lifetime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> pool ends. An example of memory pool-based allocators {{can be found in the}} Boost C++ Libraries.|$|E
5|$|Allocators {{were invented}} by Alexander Stepanov {{as part of}} the Standard Template Library (STL). They were {{originally}} intended as a means to make the library more flexible and independent of the underlying memory model, allowing programmers to utilize custom pointer and reference types with the library. However, in the process of adopting STL into the C++ standard, the C++ standardization committee realized that a complete abstraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> model would incur unacceptable performance penalties. To remedy this, the requirements of allocators were made more restrictive. As a result, the level of customization provided by allocators is more limited than was originally envisioned by Stepanov.|$|E
5|$|When the {{computer}} was not in use, contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> were preserved {{as long as the}} main lead-acid battery remained charged. The PowerBook100 Power Manager was an integrated circuit, usually placed on the logic board of a PowerBook, and was responsible for the power management of {{the computer}}. Identical to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the display's backlight, hard drive spin-down, sleep and wake, battery charging, trackball control, and input/output (I/O). The 100 did add a new feature: 3.5V batteries backed up permanent and expansion random access memory (RAM) when the PowerBook100's battery was being replaced or when the 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from all power sources. This made it a perfect candidate for use with Apple's RAM disk to help increase battery life by accessing the hard disk less frequently, since the 100 was the only PowerBook that maintained the contents of RAM on shutdown in order to reduce startup time.|$|E

50|$|Fragmentation {{of memory}} is a memory {{disorder}} in {{when an individual}} is unable to associate <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> to their autobiographical (episodic) <b>memory.</b> <b>The</b> explicit facts and details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events may be known to <b>the</b> person (semantic <b>memory).</b> However, <b>the</b> facts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events retrieve none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affective and somatic elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experience. Therefore, not allowing the emotional and personal content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> to become associated with the person's self.

25|$|Hermann Ebbinghaus {{contributed a}} lot to the {{research}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> of the brain. He made the first empirical study concerning the function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> as to the storage and forgetting of information. His major finding was that the amount of learned knowledge depends on the amount of time invested. Further, the more time that is passing by, the more repetitions that are necessary. Resulting from the findings of Ebbinghaus, the first theory of forgetting was established, the decay theory. It says that if something new is learned, a memory trace is formed. This trace will decay, if not used in the course of time, and by decaying of this trace, forgetting occurs (Weltens 1987).|$|E

30|$|These {{three types}} of memory modules are {{fabricated}} according to different architectural hierarchies. The register files reside {{right next to the}} GPU processing cores, <b>the</b> shared <b>memory</b> locates in a place with a farther distance to the GPU processing cores, and <b>the</b> global <b>memory</b> locates farthest to the GPU cores. The distance to the GPU cores determines <b>the</b> access speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific <b>memory</b> type. As a result, <b>the</b> access speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> register files is the fastest, <b>the</b> access speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shared <b>memory</b> is slower than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> register files, and <b>the</b> access speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global <b>memory</b> is <b>the</b> slowest among <b>the</b> three types <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> modules. However, on the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> size <b>of</b> a specific memory type is inversely proportional to its memory access speed. Thus, <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global <b>memory</b> is <b>the</b> largest, <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> register files is the smallest, and <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shared <b>memory</b> is between <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global <b>memory</b> and <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> register files. Therefore, in a GPU program memory assignment, small-size and frequently-used variables can be stored in the register files, while large amount of data should be stored in <b>the</b> global <b>memory.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> shared <b>memory</b> is usually used for the shared data space utilized in the computation among the GPU compute threads within a specific GPU compute block.|$|R
