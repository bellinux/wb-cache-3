Nick Gargan argues that police chiefs have welcomed and risen to the new localism agenda but central bodies are still administering direct <b>oversight</b> of <b>programmes</b> making it unclear where ultimate accountability lies.

40|$|Monitoring programmes, by necessity, must be {{commensurate}} with the socio-economic and technical and scientific development {{of the country where}} they are implemented. For example the extent of development of national legislation and co-ordinating or <b>oversight</b> <b>programmes</b> will affect activities undertaken. Similarly, more complex analytical variables require highly trained technicians and costly laboratory facilities. In general terms, it is possible to distinguish three levels into which monitoring programmes can be classified (Table 3. 1). All elements of assessment, from objective setting to data interpretation, are related to these three levels. The aim is to progressively develop monitoring operations from the basic level to the more comprehensive levels. Each level is associated with increasing demands on staff (expertise and numbers), inspection and fieldwork (complexity and frequency), laboratory facilities (range of analysis, throughput) and data management and reporting capacity.

Possible amendments to the Chicago Convention with the purpose of enhancing the USOAP are also considered and recommended...|$|R
40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need to {{increase}} coverage of the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) particularly in Madhya Pradesh and to overcome governance failures, such as staff absenteeism, leakage of funds and supplies and false reporting of coverage. By increasing community participation, ownership of the scheme, and improving <b>programme</b> <b>oversight,</b> social audits can result in increased coverage as well as better accountability among service?providers and the relevant line departments. The bulk of experience with social audits comes from implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), which mandates that social audits be conducted prior to fund release. There is also some experience of using social audits for ICDS in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. This article examines the experiences from those two states and draws lessons for its application in states such as Madhya Pradesh...|$|R
40|$|Considering {{that civil}} {{aviation}} safety {{is one of}} the most important elements in all aviation-related activities, this thesis presents the state of compliance of aviation safety in the Russian Federation. In the former Soviet Union, the authorities made sure that the rest of the world knew that its territory was impenetrable. In the 1980 s, their attack on the civilian flight KE 007 of the Korean Airlines, which lead to the crash of the aircraft and the death of innocent civilian passengers, demonstrated that when it came to guarding their territory, they showed little concern for the lives of innocent civilians. The first chapter focuses on how the Russian Federation managed the necessary transition from the Soviet-era system to a modernized aviation system with the objective of ensuring aviation safety. The second chapter presents the development of the ICAO Universal Safety <b>Oversight</b> Audit <b>Programme</b> since the 1990 s and details the compliance of Russian air law with international standards and recommended practices related to aviation safety. The last chapter highlights the necessity for the European Union and Russia to have working arrangements to conduct safety assessments of foreign aircraft to ensure aviation safety. This chapter also highlights the advantages of concluding comprehensive air transport agreements between them to harmonize their aviation relations and to solve pending issues, such as improving market opportunities for both sides, compliance with Community law by including an EU Community carrier clauses in bilateral agreements with Russia, and implementation of a phase-out of trans-Siberian overflight payments.

40|$|Aim: Multidrug-resistant {{tuberculosis}} (MDR-TB) arises where {{treatment is}} interrupted or inadequate, when patients are treated inappropriately, or {{when an individual}} has impaired immune function, {{which can lead to}} a rapid progression from infection with an MDR-strain to disease. This study examines the role of health systems in amplifying or preventing the development of MDR-TB. Methods: We present two comparative studies, which were undertaken in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (TFYR Macedonia) and Moldova. Results: The findings reveal several health systems-level factors that contribute to the different rates of MDR-TB observed in these two countries, including: pre-existing burden of disease; organization of the health system, with the existence of parallel systems; power dynamics among policy makers and disease programmes; and the accountability & effectiveness of <b>programme</b> <b>oversight.</b> Conclusions: The findings do not offer a universal template for health system reform but do identify specific factors that may be contributing to the epidemic and are worthy of further attention in the two countries...|$|R

The 1997 Amsterdam Conference on Combating the Most Intolerable Forms of Child Labour and the 1997 Oslo International Conference on Child Labour both {{drew attention to}} the urgent need for concerted global action to end child labour, and called for an expansion of information gathering, statistics and empirical research to help inform this action.The inter-agency programme, Understanding Childrenâ€™s Work (UCW), was initiated by the International Labour Organization (ILO), UNICEF and the World Bank as one of the responses to the recommendations of the Amsterdam and Oslo conferences.Through a variety of research activities, the UCW Programme supports the partner agencies in improving statistical information on child labour in its various dimensions - its nature, extent, causes and consequences - as well as on what policy approaches are most effective in addressing it.The Programmeâ€™s inter-agency configuration and technical orientation leave it uniquely placed to act as a platform for research cooperation, policy dialogue, partnership building and knowledge exchange in child labour and related policy areas. As partner agency efforts accelerate towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (by 2015) and the elimination of worst forms (by 2016), these Programme functions will likely only grow in importance. A Steering Committee composed of senior management representatives from each of the three partner agencies is responsible for the establishment and <b>oversight</b> of the <b>Programmeâ€™s</b> overall strategic direction and goals.|$|R
40|$|Pharmacotherapeutic {{advances}} {{in the treatment of}} depression have included the development of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), thereby providing alternatives to tricyclic antidepressants. Concurrent with these events have been significant structural (e. g. pharmaceutical formularies) and regulatory (e. g. required pharmacoeconomic evaluations) changes in the delivery, financing, and <b>oversight</b> of healthcare <b>programmes</b> throughout the world. International cost-containment initiatives are increasingly mandating a demonstration of value for money, defined in terms of a measurable health and/or financial outcome, and, in the case of medicines, attributable to a given expenditure, for a given pharmacotherapeutic option. We examine the inherent strengths and weaknesses of 5 study designs used to discern and contrast financial outcomes stemming from the use of antidepressant pharmacotherapy for the treatment of depressive illness [randomised controlled trials (RCTs); meta-analyses; decision-analytical models (DAMs); retrospective database investigations; randomised naturalistic inquiry]. We argue that the economic appraisal of pharmacotherapy requires an iterative process extending from the developmental (RCTs; meta-analyses; DAMs) through to the postmarketing phase (database reviews; naturalistic inquiry), thereby resulting in a porfolio of evidence as to the safety, efficacy and effectiveness of a given pharmacotherapeutic category (e. g. SSRIs) and/or a specific medication. Database reviews, while nonrandomised, and prospective naturalistic inquiry afford greater insight into the patterns of use and financial merits of prescribing specific pharmacotherapeutic options for the treatment of depression within the context of clinical practice as compared with RCTs, meta-analyses and DAMs. The portfolio of evidence to date indicates that the first-line use of SSRIs in the treatment of depression is clinically warranted, and represents value for money.

40|$|In 1981 the {{apartheid}} military initiated a {{chemical and biological}} warfare (CBW) programme (code-named Project Coast). The programme, terminated in 1993, was aimed at developing novel irritating and incapacitating agents for internal and external use, covert assassination weapons for use against apartheid opponents, and defensive equipment for use by South African Defence Force (SADF) troops in Angola. The CBW programme was driven by a single individual, Dr Wouter Basson, who reported to a military management committee (the Co-ordinating Management Committee) which comprised {{a select group of}} high ranking officers. Practical and financial <b>oversight</b> of the <b>programme</b> was weak which allowed both for the abuse of programme funds and for senior military officers to deny knowledge of aspects of the programme. The biological component of Project Coast was conducted in violation of the commitments of the South African government to the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention (BTWC). While the stateâ€™s commitment to the BTWC was one of the factors considered when initiating the programme, it was not a sufficient constraint to prevent the development of the biological weapons programme, but rather influenced its structure such that the programme could avoid national and international detection. Despite efforts to conceal the military front companies where the chemical and biological warfare (CBW) research and development was undertaken, evidence presented in this thesis shows that the United States had sufficient information about the programme to have been aware of its existence. Yet, it was only in 1993, {{on the eve of the}} democratic election in South Africa, that any attempt was made by the US administration to pressure the government to terminate the programme. This thesis considers the factors which influenced the decision to develop Project Coast; the structure and nature of the programme; the motivations of scientists to become involved in the programme and remain involved; the use of chemical and biological agents against opponents of the state, and the factors which influenced the termination of the programme on the eve of the first democratic elections in 1994. It also considers the nature and exent of international support, both tacit and overt, for the programme and argues that the failure of Western nations to call for the termination of the programme before the early 1990 s was a function of political expediency and indicates a significant weakness in the ability of international agreements to constrain the development of such programmes...|$|R
40|$|D. Phil. (Curriculum Studies) The study {{highlights}} the conceptual and practical challenges in providing initial teacher education that promotes, amongst other factors, coherence with the prescribed school curriculum. It investigates a History Teaching Methods (HTM) course {{offered by a}} university in Kenya to clarify how course related documents, lectures, studentsâ€™ microteaching lessons, and perceptions about these three aspects obtained from interviews with a teacher-educator and students addressed what the course had to provide as possibilities for the acquisition of professional knowledge and skills that would enable students to teach effectively the secondary school History and Government (H&G) subject. Through a review of literature on curriculum coherence and theories on ethical pedagogic practice and communication combined with primary data collected in Kenya, I explain {{the nature of the}} challenges in the HTM course. The challenges, I argue, are primarily a result of overlooking the disciplinary requirements of History. The findings suggest that misconceptions about professional responsibilities of the teacher-educators are largely responsible for the descriptive approach that characterises the pedagogical practices they promoted. The absence of engagement with disciplinary requirements in lectures contributed {{to the nature of the}} devices that were used by students to teach. In order to clarify the nature of these pedagogic challenges, I adopted a generic qualitative approach to the research. The direct contact and discussion with a teacher-educator and students enabled me to explore their understanding of the requirements of teaching history at school level. Through observations of lectures I established how the teacher-educators considered these requirements as important to the teacher education they provided. Through observing studentsâ€™ microteaching lessons I was able to establish their understanding of the nature of historical knowledge and how it ought to be approached when teaching. The study contributes to the general field of teacher education by having devised a conceptual orientation that can be drawn on to establish what is necessary to teach school history effectively, namely, the importance of normative critical thinking and contextual sensitivity. In this study, I indicate the pedagogic processes that need to be considered and constantly in place to teach history by drawing on relevant paradigms and conceptual orientations belonging to the discipline. I found that teacher-educators underplay the importance of these factors and view them as having to be considered by academic entities that are directly involved with history as a discipline. It is due to this <b>oversight</b> that the <b>programme</b> seemed to emphasise descriptive and procedural orientations in initial teacher education. I conclude by suggesting that a course that educates student teachers for, amongst other reasons, teaching H&G at secondary school in Kenya, has to consider firstly, what is essential to history teaching and learning as a discipline and secondly that effective history teaching has to be informed by reasoning that is not only relevant to History as a discipline but also its practicality to the objectives of school history...|$|R
