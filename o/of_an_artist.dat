5|$|Chekhov had {{at first}} written stories only for {{financial}} gain, but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations which {{have influenced the}} evolution of the modern short story. He made no apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers, insisting that the role <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> was to ask questions, not to answer them.|$|E

5|$|Susanna Paine, {{also known}} as Susannah and Susan (June 9, 1792 – November 10, 1862), was an American {{portrait}} artist in New England in the 19th century.

5|$|The ballet {{has been}} {{variously}} interpreted and adapted. The 1917 Russian film The Dying Swan by director Yevgeni Bauer, for example, {{tells the story}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> who strangles a ballerina. Maya Plisetskaya re-interpreted the swan simply as elderly and stubbornly resisting the effects of aging, much like herself. Eventually the piece came to be considered one of Pavlova's trademarks. More recently, Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo perform a parody version that emphasizes every excess dormant in the choreography, and, in 2000, street theatre artist Judith Lanigan created a hula hoop act based on the Fokine/Pavlova ballet divertissement that has been performed at international street theatre festivals, comedy and burlesque events, and in traditional and contemporary-style circuses.|$|E

5|$|Van der Goes's is the {{earliest}} extant autographed version, {{and one of}} the most important. This panel was originally a diptych wing of which the accompanying panel of the Virgin and Child is lost, and was probably made for a guild. Luke is dressed in a heavy red robe, draws a preparatory sketch in silverpoint, and wears a melancholy expression. Building on van der Weyden's theme of the role, practice and craft <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist,</b> van der Goes places pieces of charcoal, a knife and the feathers of a small bird in front of the saint. The similarities to the van der Weyden are many and striking, and include the painting utensils, red robes, physician's cap and blue mantle. The figure has the same middle-aged facial type and his pose, kneeling on a green cushion, although reversed compared to van der Weyden's, is the same. Van der Goes's adaption both increased van der Weyden's standing in the eyes of the later artist's followers, and led to a new group of copies that were modelled on the later painting.|$|E

25|$|The trial {{had been}} {{considered}} problematic because of the troubling possibility <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> being arbitrarily prosecuted for his work, art being open {{to a variety of}} interpretations.

25|$|Motives also figured {{occasionally}} in purely instrumental {{music of the}} Romantic period.
