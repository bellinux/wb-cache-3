5|$|Busch biographer Joseph Kraus divided {{his work}} into three periods. He points out, however, that this {{classification}} is a simplification, as some works by their nature {{can be of}} a later or earlier period. All three periods show Busch's obsession with German middle class life. His peasants are devoid of sensitivity and village life {{is marked by a}} vivid lack <b>of</b> <b>sentiment.</b>|$|E
5|$|I am vexed and {{surprised}} at your not thinking {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I say it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting {{that you are a}} man – For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as I have described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement <b>of</b> <b>sentiment</b> should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Travers' working {{relationship}} with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy <b>of</b> <b>sentiment</b> and whimsy. Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, {{given the nature of}} the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character George Banks, the estranged father of the children in Mary Poppins' charge, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel. Gradually, they grasp how deeply personal the Mary Poppins stories are to her and how many of the characters were inspired by her past.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes, the {{structure}} of sentiments and topics is fairly complex. Also, the problem <b>of</b> <b>sentiment</b> analysis is non-monotonic in respect to sentence extension and stop-word substitution (compare THEY would not let my dog stay in this hotel vs I would not let my dog stay in this hotel). To address this issue a number of rule-based and reasoning-based approaches have been applied to sentiment analysis, including defeasible logic programming. Also, there is a number of tree traversal rules applied to syntactic parse tree to extract the topicality <b>of</b> <b>sentiment</b> in open domain setting.|$|E
25|$|One {{step towards}} this aim is {{accomplished}} in research.

25|$|When the First Wheeling Convention met, 425 {{delegates from}} 25 {{counties}} were present, but a division <b>of</b> <b>sentiment</b> soon arose. Some delegates favored the immediate {{formation of a}} new state, while others argued that, as Virginia's secession had not yet been ratified or become effective, such action would constitute revolution against the United States. It was decided that if the ordinance were adopted (of which there was little doubt) another convention including the members-elect of the legislature should meet at Wheeling in June 1861.|$|E
40|$|Analyzing sentiments behind natural {{language}} processing {{is the focus of}} current research and the construction <b>of</b> <b>sentiments</b> lexicon is the foundation to analysis sentiments.

The proposed framework reflected extremely fine characteristics of the domain feature. Experimental results showed that the proposed framework was effective in the automatic evaluation and layed a sound foundation for the domain-oriented sentiment tendency analysis...|$|R

25|$|According to the {{statistics}} released on October 21, 2010 by the Institute of Sociology of National Academy of Science of Ukraine, positive attitudes towards Russians have been decreasing since 1994. In {{response to a}} question gauging tolerance of Russians, 15% of Western Ukrainians responded positively. In Central Ukraine, 30% responded positively (from 60% in 1994); 60% responded positively in Southern Ukraine (from 70% in 1994); and 64% responded positively in Eastern Ukraine (from 75% in 1994). Furthermore, 6-7% of Western Ukrainians would banish Russians entirely from Ukraine, and 7-8% in Central Ukraine responded similarly. This level <b>of</b> <b>sentiment</b> was not found in Southern or Eastern Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{subsequent}} {{efforts were}} less sophisticated, using a mere polar view <b>of</b> <b>sentiment,</b> from positive to negative, such as work by Turney, and Pang who applied different methods for {{detecting the polarity}} of product reviews and movie reviews respectively. This work is at the document level. One can also classify a document's polarity on a multi-way scale, which was attempted by Pang and Snyder among others: Pang and Lee expanded the basic task of classifying a movie review as either positive or negative to predict star ratings on either a 3- or a 4-star scale, while Snyder performed an in-depth analysis of restaurant reviews, predicting ratings for {{various aspects of the}} given restaurant, such as the food and atmosphere (on a five-star scale).|$|E
25|$|West Virginia was {{the only}} state in the Union to {{separate}} from a Confederate state (Virginia) during the American Civil War. In Richmond on April 17, 1861, the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 voted to secede from the Union, but of the 49 delegates from the northwestern corner (which ultimately became West Virginia), only voted 17 {{in favor of the}} Ordinance of Secession, and 30 voted against, with 2 abstentions. Almost immediately after that vote, a mass meeting at Clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to a convention to meet in Wheeling on May 13, 1861. When this First Wheeling Convention met, 425 delegates from 25 counties were present, though {{more than one-third of the}} delegates were from the northern panhandle area, but soon there was a division <b>of</b> <b>sentiment.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Given {{the very}} {{ambiguous}} and imprecise nature <b>of</b> <b>sentiments</b> and <b>of</b> their expressions, this survey focuses on ap-proaches {{making use of}} components of graduality in the task <b>of</b> automatic <b>sentiments</b> analysis. To that aim, we review methods taking account of intrinsic psychological models components of graduality as well as extrinsic components issued from computational intelligence approaches. In particular, beyond psychological models <b>of</b> <b>sentiments</b> that define affective states as multidimensional vectors in affective continuous spaces, we identify three components of graduality, namely composition or blending, intensity and inheritance. In our discussion, we review how fuzzy set theory {{as well as other}} gradual structures based on a vectorial representation are employed to describe affective states as complex or imprecise entities. Finally, we focus on verbal expressions <b>of</b> <b>sentiments</b> and more specifically, we discuss the use of components of graduality {{in order to deal with}} sentiments complex and subtle expressions issued from the expressive power of natural languages.

25|$|Open source {{software}} tools deploy machine learning, statistics, and {{natural language processing}} techniques to automate sentiment analysis on large collections of texts, including web pages, online news, internet discussion groups, online reviews, web blogs, and social media. Knowledge-based systems, on the other hand, make use of publicly available resources, to extract the semantic and affective information associated with natural language concepts. Sentiment analysis can also be performed on visual content, i.e., images and videos. One of the first approach in this direction is SentiBank utilizing an adjective noun pair representation of visual content. In addition, the vast majority <b>of</b> <b>sentiment</b> classification approaches rely on the bag-of-words model, which disregards context, grammar and even word order. Approaches that analyses the sentiment based on how words compose the meaning of longer phrases have shown better result, but they incur an additional annotation overhead.|$|E
25|$|Fafhrd is a {{very tall}} (nearly seven feet) and strong {{northern}} barbarian, skilled at both swordsmanship and singing; the Mouser is a small (not much more than five feet) mercurial thief, gifted and deadly at swordsmanship (often using a sword {{in one hand and}} a long dagger—technically a main-gauche—in the other), and a former wizard's apprentice who retains some skill at magic. Fafhrd talks like a romantic, but his strong practicality usually wins through, while the cynical-sounding Mouser is prone to showing strains <b>of</b> <b>sentiment</b> at unexpected times. Both are rogues, living in a decadent world where to be so is a requirement of survival. They spend a lot of time drinking, feasting, wenching, brawling, stealing, and gambling, and are seldom fussy about who hires their swords. But they are humane and—most of all—relish true adventure.|$|E
25|$|It {{refers to}} {{determining}} the opinions or sentiments expressed on different features or aspects of entities, e.g., {{of a cell}} phone, a digital camera, or a bank. A feature or aspect is an attribute or component of an entity, e.g., the screen of a cell phone, the service for a restaurant, or the picture quality of a camera. The advantage of feature-based sentiment analysis is the possibility to capture nuances about objects of interest. Different features can generate different sentiment responses, for example a hotel can have a convenient location, but mediocre food. This problem involves several sub-problems, e.g., identifying relevant entities, extracting their features/aspects, and determining whether an opinion expressed on each feature/aspect is positive, negative or neutral. The automatic identification of features can be performed with syntactic methods, with topic modeling, or with deep learning. More detailed discussions about this level <b>of</b> <b>sentiment</b> analysis {{can be found in}} Liu's work.|$|E

The test bed was developed using linguistic categories of lexical indicators <b>of</b> <b>sentiments</b> and selected sentences which have various levels <b>of</b> <b>sentiments.</b> Experimental results indicate that variations in syntactic categories of the lexical indicators influence the thought in deciding sentiments at varied levels.

25|$|A {{different}} {{method for}} determining sentiment {{is the use}} of a scaling system whereby words commonly associated with having a negative, neutral, or positive sentiment with them are given an associated number on a −10 to +10 scale (most negative up to most positive) or simply from 0 to a positive upper limit such as +4. This makes it possible to adjust the sentiment of a given term relative to its environment (usually on the level of the sentence). When a piece of unstructured text is analyzed using natural language processing, each concept in the specified environment is given a score based on the way sentiment words relate to the concept and its associated score. This allows movement to a more sophisticated understanding <b>of</b> <b>sentiment,</b> because it is now possible to adjust the sentiment value of a concept relative to modifications that may surround it. Words, for example, that intensify, relax or negate the sentiment expressed by the concept can affect its score. Alternatively, texts can be given a positive and negative sentiment strength score if the goal is to determine the sentiment in a text rather than the overall polarity and strength of the text.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the close}} of a September day in the year 1864, a crowd of {{students}} was collected on the Bowdoin campus near the Thorndike oak. Each class was not only represented, but present almost in its entirety; still, as the college at that time bore upon its rolls only about a hundred names, the reader is not to imagine the assembly as one of remarkable proportions. The several classes, without being grouped as separate bodies, were in a measure distinct, as if their members were drawn together by community <b>of</b> <b>sentiment</b> or interest. The center, of the throng was composed mainly of Sophomores who, to the melody of tin horns, devil's fiddles and watchmen's rattles, {{from time to time}} added vocal effects scarcely less loud and discordant. Next to them stood the open-eyed Freshmen, eagerly appreciative of the novelty of the scene; while most of the upper-class men were ranged along the outer edge or a little apart, and were endeavoring to preserve looks and attitudes of aloofness and indifference. The object of attraction appeared to be a tall, spare man who was standing upon a rude plank-and-barrel rostrum, and, whenever the uproar would permit, launching his remarks in a violent manner at the bystanders. He was apparently some sixty years of age. His head was uncovered, showing his hair thin and streaked with gray. His face was smooth except for a stubbly two days' growth of beard, and was wrinkled and browned by exposure to the weather. Beside him upon the platform rested a dilapidated silk hat which, as well as his suit of rusty black, looked as if it might have been discarded some years before by its former owner. They were not, however, incongruous {{with the rest of his}} attire, since both his dickey above and his shirt below his black stock bore the same signs of poverty and neglect.|$|E

However, while Rousseau ultimately rejects society, Wollstonecraft celebrates both domesticity and industrial progress.|$|E
