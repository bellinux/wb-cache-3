5|$|Senior officer Mark (Robin Clarke) radios Sandy – his romantic {{interest}} – {{from the}} <b>Operations</b> <b>Room</b> to stall for time as Kate and operations chief Gary (Steven Grives) depart to requisition chainsaws from a storage room. The ruse is uncovered and Sandy harpoons Gary outside the airlock, breathing the atmosphere to no ill effect as she mauls his flesh. Preparing {{for a final}} confrontation, Mark stumbles across Sandy's newborn, mutant twins. He entrusts them to Sharon as the mother blasts through the <b>Operations</b> <b>Room</b> door and destroys all the equipment inside, although {{it is evident that}} she no longer possesses unnatural strength. Crippled by an explosive charge, Kate is gored to death. In a last stand, Mark strangles and kills Sandy with a ripped-out cable. He returns to Sharon to discover one of the twins biting at her slit neck, before its sibling launches itself at him.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, between July and October 1940, RAF Fighter Command at RAF Bentley Priory {{received}} air threat {{warnings that}} it filtered to remove duplication, doubt and confusion. These were then forwarded to the <b>Operations</b> <b>Room</b> at RAF Uxbridge, which allocated appropriate defence resources and passed orders on to No. 11 Group sector airfields. No. 11 Group personnel doubled to 20,000 between April and November 1940. The RAF officers' hospital was converted to the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) hospital early in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Following the station's closure, the replica No. 33 Squadron Supermarine Spitfire gate {{guardian}} {{was removed}} from the main entrance for restoration work and moved to the entrance of the <b>Operations</b> <b>Room</b> (now known as the Battle of Britain Bunker). The area around the bunker was retained as an enclave under the RAF Uxbridge name, under the care of RAF Northolt. An additional guardian, a Hawker Hurricane in the colours of No. 303 (Polish) Squadron, was added to the area in November 2010.|$|E
40|$|Halothane, {{as one of}} {{the most}} widely used anesthetics in general anesthesia, has been found to play a role in causing Halothane Hepatitis, raising liver enzymes as well as a number of {{congenital}} abnormalities under frequent exposure. In this case-control study the possible contamination of <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> was probed through the measurement of the probable changes in liver enzymes among the <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> staff. The study was conducted on two groups: 1) Case group consisted of 40 <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> staff and 2) Control group consisted of 40 ward staff. The results showed that halothane could affect liver enzymes among the <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> staff especially in women. It seems that exposure to Halothane vapor among the <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> can be regarded as a risk factor...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Education {{is based}} upon the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are {{required}} for an occupation, and the changes occurring in the occupations and duties {{as well as in the}} ideals and values necessitate constant needs analysis. Furthermore, owing to the transformations in sciences, especially medical sciences, the current syllabus for the <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> courses at associate level will not meet the requirements for <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> personnel in future. Therefore, the syllabus for <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> B. S. was developed and proposed in a research project entitled “Study of the international syllabus for the <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> courses and proposing an appropriate syllabus for the courses in Iran. ” Since the <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> courses at B. S. level are supposed to be introduced in Iranian universities, we intended to learn about the opinions of other people related to this subject in Iran. METHODS: In this research, a questionnaire was used that contained the syllabus proposed for the <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> B. S. courses, which was the result of a research project entitled “Study of the international syllabus for the <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> courses and proposing an appropriate syllabus for the courses in Iran. ” To develop this syllabus, 12 heads of the <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> departments in universities across Iran in which the subject matter was being taught at associate level were consulted. RESULTS: The study showed that 14 out of the 53 courses proposed in the syllabus had a desirability level of 100...|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{resuscitation}} is {{the cornerstone}} in treatment of shock, and intravenous fluid administration is the most frequent intervention in <b>operation</b> <b>rooms</b> and intensive care units (ICUs). The composition of fluids used for fluid resuscitation gained interest over the past decade, with recent focus on whether balanced solutions should be preferred over isotonic saline. Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fluid resuscitation with a balanced solution versus isotonic saline in adult patients in <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> or ICUs. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, secondary outcomes included occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). The search identified 11 RCTs involving 2, 703 patients; 8 trials were conducted in <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> and 3 in ICU. In-hospital mortality, {{as well as the}} occurrence of AKI and need for RRT was not different between resuscitation with balanced solutions versus isotonic saline, neither in <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> nor in ICU patients. Serum chloride levels, but not arterial pH, were significantly lower in patients resuscitated with balanced solutions. Currently evidence insufficiently supports the use of balanced over isotonic saline for fluid resuscitation to improve outcome of <b>operation</b> <b>room</b> and ICU patient...|$|R
5|$|In 2007 {{the station}} {{underwent}} a major modernisation, removing the murals {{installed on the}} Central and Bakerloo line platforms in the 1980s and replacing them with plain white tiles, in a style {{similar to those used}} when the station opened in 1900. One 1980s mural remains on one of the platforms. The Central line platform works were substantially complete and a new Station <b>Operations</b> <b>Room</b> at top level opened. This enabled the entire CCTV system to be switched over to new recordable digital technology. The original motifs designed by Hans Unger on the Victoria line platforms were restored.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the <b>operations</b> <b>room</b> at RAF Uxbridge was {{disturbed}} by {{a visit from}} Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Most of the plotting tables were bare, save for a few plots indicating German reconnaissance machines. Most of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) were relaxing, in spite of Churchill’s presence (he had ordered that they not behave any differently). However, at 10:30 the first German aircraft triggered the alarm at Chain Home radar station at Dover. The filter room at Stanmore recognised the formation as hostile. The WAAF detailed group and sector commands throughout the south that 40-plus enemy aircraft were entering Kentish airspace.|$|E

In this thesis, we develop a model to help <b>Operation</b> <b>room</b> scheduling management to schedule elective patients based on the availability of surgeons and <b>operation</b> <b>rooms</b> with three phase hierarchical approach of scheduling. A linear integer goal programming method is used to solve problem. The model tries to minimize number of patients waiting for service, underutilization of operating room hours and maximum number of patients in the recovery units. Windsor Regional Hospital help is taken to understand the surgery booking procedure. Lexicographic goal programming method and weighted goal programming is employed and various combinations of priorities are solved to schedule Operating rooms. The focus of the study is to develop mathematical model for scheduling...|$|R
5|$|Several {{historical}} events {{have taken place}} in and around the town, including attempted negotiations between King Charles I and the Parliamentary Army during the English Civil War. The public house at the centre of those events, since renamed the Crown & Treaty, still stands. Uxbridge also houses the Battle of Britain Bunker, from where the air defence of the south-east of England was coordinated during the Battle of Britain. Situated in RAF Uxbridge, the No. 11 Group <b>Operations</b> <b>Room</b> within the bunker played a crucial rule during the battle and was later used during the D-Day landings.|$|E
5|$|Uxbridge had a Royal Air Force station, {{known as}} RAF Uxbridge, until its closure on 31 March 2010. The station was built within {{the grounds of}} Hillingdon House, a 19th-century mansion bought by the British {{government}} in 1915, and became most famous {{as the home of}} RAF Fighter Command's No. 11 Group <b>Operations</b> <b>Room</b> during the Battle of Britain. Fighter squadrons at airfields in the south-east of England were directed from the station, which was visited by Prime Minister Winston Churchill during the battle, and other foreign leaders {{throughout the rest of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|As a {{historic}} site, many of Duxford's buildings {{are of particular}} architectural or historic significance. In 2005, following a review of sites relating to British aviation history by English Heritage, some 255 buildings at 31 sites received listed building status. Duxford contains over thirty of these buildings, the largest number at any one site. Listed buildings include three hangars {{dating back to the}} First World War and the operations block, which received Grade II* status. This block, open to the public, houses the wartime <b>operations</b> <b>room</b> from which Duxford's aircraft were directed. Another historic building, the 1918 Watch Office, will be converted to accommodate a new exhibition entitled Historic Duxford. The exhibition, to open in late 2012, will depict the history of the site and the experiences of Duxford's personnel.|$|E

5|$|During the inter-war years, the {{government}} {{concluded that the}} fort was no longer militarily useful and there were unsuccessful attempts to sell it off for development. During the Second World War, the fort initially housed an improvised anti-aircraft <b>operations</b> <b>room,</b> controlling the defences of the Thames and Medway (North) Gun Zone between 1939 and 1940. Trenches were dug across the surrounding area to prevent an airborne attack. The enlisted barracks and the facilities block, as well as probably the sutler's house, were bombed and damaged, being demolished after the war. The fort was transferred out of military use relatively early in the post-war period, and in 1950 the Ministry of Works took over the site. Restoration work {{took place in the}} 1970, including the construction of replica wooden bridges. It was opened to the public in 1982.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere on the Camp, the Army began {{replacing}} the wartime Nissen huts with more permanent structures. New barracks opened in 1955, and the Headquarters of the Army in Scotland arrived {{the same year}} from Edinburgh Castle. Further land was purchased from Lord Rosebery and married quarters were built close to the river. In 1966, a purpose-built office block, by architects Bowhill Gibson and Laing, was constructed within the walled garden, and named Annandale Block in honour of the builder of Craigiehall. Craigiehall Camp was also {{the site of a}} Cold War Anti-Aircraft <b>Operations</b> <b>Room,</b> built in the 1950s. The two-storey, reinforced concrete structure was listed in 2016 as the best surviving example of its type in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{continued}} to the pedestrian gate where he stabbed the officer controlling the gate, and two officers {{who had just}} entered the prison. This incident was seen by a soldier on duty in a watch tower, who reported to the British Army <b>operations</b> <b>room</b> {{that he had seen}} prison officers fighting. The <b>operations</b> <b>room</b> telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied that everything was all right and that an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier. At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage {{out of the room and}} telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners had opened the main gate, and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and make their way to the outer fence which was 25 yards away. Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near the gate and abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier. At the main gate, a prison officer was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner who fired the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a watch tower, and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over the fence, and by 4:18 pm the main gate was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter. The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since World War II.|$|E

According to other sources, 10 hangars were destroyed, six damaged, the <b>operations</b> <b>room</b> put out of action, and many buildings were destroyed. It would have been worse had the bombs been released higher. A lot of bombs landed horizontally and did not explode on impact. To achieve this level of damage, KG 76 dropped nine tons of bombs. At {{the end of the}} day just one hangar was left operational at Kenley. The low-level raid put the airfield out of commission for two hours. In combat, two Hurricanes were shot down by the Dorniers' return fire. In return 9 Staffel lost four Do 17s, three slightly damaged and two seriously damaged. Low-level attacks were abandoned after The Hardest Day.|$|E
5|$|The {{intelligence}} assumes {{control of}} Sandy, {{who has been}} marked {{in the same way}} as Ricky.

The rest of the team seek refuge in the <b>Operations</b> <b>Room</b> as Sandy destroys essential machinery – including the base transmitter – with explosives. When the imbalance in Sandy's mind appears to correct itself, Karl, Sharon and Commander Holly McKay (Jennifer Ashley) attempt to sedate her to spare the unborn children. Sandy's madness returns and Holly and Karl are killed in an accident with heat-sealing apparatus, whereupon Sandy disembowels the corpses.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{political}} pressure, the MoD continued to lack confidence in UNAMSIL leadership. Thus, the British government refused to place combat troops under UN command, but did second additional staff officers to UNAMSIL, to the UN headquarters in New York, {{and to the}} SLA. The officers attached to UNAMSIL were tasked with assisting its commanders in planning and mounting operations and were led by a brigadier who became UNAMSIL's chief of staff, while in New York, the officers attached to UN headquarters provided planning support for logistics operations to bring UNAMSIL up to its mandated strength. At the same time, {{the focus of the}} British training programme shifted. Although six battalions had been trained, the SLA still lacked many combat support functions as well as command and control capabilities. The STTTs set out to improve the SLA's capabilities in these areas by providing the next set of recruits with more specialised training in addition to basic infantry training provided to the first intake. The British trainers also constructed an <b>operations</b> <b>room</b> at the SLA's headquarters and provided other support to improve the SLA's communications and logistical capabilities.|$|E

5|$|On 16February 1944, the {{day after}} the {{contentious}} destruction of Monte Cassino, Eaton took No.3 Squadron through a break in the bad weather to attack the ruined monastery, the only one of No.239 Wing's units to successfully bomb its target that day. He handed over command of No.3 Squadron later that month, and was transferred to No.1 Mobile <b>Operations</b> <b>Room</b> Unit as forward air controller for the final assault on Monte Cassino. The run of luck that Eaton experienced in his first weeks of air combat in Tunisia continued on the ground in Italy. He survived three months of constant artillery fire, including an occasion when a shell exploded directly above his observation post, striking down a British officer standing next to him. He also came under machine-gun fire when he took a wrong turn one day and drove into the German lines, but again escaped unhurt. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 7April, in recognition of his leadership of No.3 Squadron in North Africa, Malta, Sicily and Italy.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffes plan {{of attack}} was simple. German bombers were to strike at the RAF airfields in the {{south-east}} corner of England. The most important airfields in this region, {{under the command of}} AOC (Air Officer Commanding) Keith Park and his No. 11 Group RAF, were the Sector Stations at RAF Kenley, Biggin Hill, Hornchurch, North Weald, Northolt, Tangmere and Debden. The first five were on the periphery of Greater London. Tangmere was in the south near the coast at Chichester, while Debden was in the north near Saffron Walden. Each of these airfields housed two to three squadrons and had its own sector <b>operations</b> <b>room.</b> From there, its fighters were directed from its satellite airfields into combat. There were six satellite airfields at Westhampnett, Croydon, Gravesend, Manston, Rochford and RAF Martlesham Heath; Manston and Martlesham Heath each housed two squadrons, the remainder each housed one. Finally, there was RAF Hawkinge, just inland from Folkestone. Not all of these airfields were targeted on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremonial}} {{entrance to}} the north-west of the station, St Andrew's Gate, was officially opened on 16 December 1957 to mark the link between Uxbridge and the Royal Air Force. A memorial to the personnel of No. 11 Group, made of Cornish granite, {{was placed in the}} ground above the <b>Operations</b> <b>Room</b> in 1957. No. 11 Group moved to RAF Martlesham Heath on 14 April 1958 and the room was soon sealed in its original condition. The memorial was unveiled by Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding on 23 April 1958 in a ceremony attended by Group Captain Douglas Bader and Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, among others, and marked by a flypast of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. Control of RAF Hillingdon passed from Fighter Command to Technical Training Command that year, at which time the entire site became known as RAF Uxbridge. The RAF School of Education moved into Hillingdon House from RAF Spitalgate on 10 November 1958, and the station was subsequently merged with No. 22 Group RAF.|$|E
5|$|Both of the {{targeted}} airfields contained sector <b>operations</b> <b>rooms</b> {{from which the}} British fighters were directed into action.
