40|$|Numerical models used to {{simulate}} the lofting mechanisms of runway stones were developed to assess the threat to aircraft structures from runway debris impacts. An inflated aircraft tire model, which was validated by comparison with experimental indentation tests, showed that <b>over-rolling</b> of stones under typical takeoff conditions led to only modest vertical loft velocities of less than 5 m/s. Experiments using a drop weight impactor {{to simulate}} a section of aircraft tire descending upon stones, demonstrated that lofting was achieved with impacts with low rubber thicknesses, but with greater rubber thickness lofting was suppressed. Using more realistic tire geometries resulted in launches with backspin, but only horizontally along {{the ground in the}} direction of the tire axis. The speed at which launches occurred was proportional to the rate of descent of the tire section and would consequently determine the loft speeds due to potential asperity lofting.

40|$|Quantifying {{the surface}} {{roughness}} evolution in contacts {{is a crucial}} step in the fatigue prediction process. Surfaces are initially conditioned by the running-in process and later altered by surface fatigue. The {{aim of this study}} is to understand and predict the evolution of the micro-geometry in the first few <b>over-rolling</b> cycles. Numerical predictions are validated by experiments. A major difficulty in understanding surface degradation is the measurement of the surface roughness evolution at the relevant scales. A twin disc micro-test rig, called μMag, was specially designed for this kind of analysis. The μMag allows the “in situ” observation of changes in the disc surface during interrupted tests, thus avoiding dismounting the specimens, which is a major cause of inaccuracy. The new method also maintains the relative position of the two discs. The precision of the measurements allows one to use the initial surface micro-geometry as input for the numerical contact calculation. Thus, the plastic deformation of the surfaces can be measured during the first cycles and compared to the numerical prediction. Results show a very good agreement between numerical predictions and experimental measurements...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{initiated}} fatigue {{caused by}} debris {{is one of}} the most dominant failure modes for lubricated machine elements such as bearings, gears, cam and followers, etc. The existence of debris in lubricant significantly reduces the contact fatigue life. The life reduction is due to the surface damage caused by the debris when it is rolled into the contact. This dissertation presents the analytical, numerical and experimental studies of the debris denting effects on the elastohydrodynamic lubricated contacts. ^ Debris indentation model, thermal elastohydrodynamid lubrication contact model with dent effects, and elasto-plasto hydrodynamic lubrication contact model were developed to investigate debris denting effects. The results indicate that when debris enters a lubricated contact, it will indent the surfaces causing surface damage. Dents in the contact will create high pressure spikes and result in stress concentrations on the surface, which lead to surface initiated failures. ^ Based on the damage mechanics theory, spall initiation and propagation models were developed for both line and point contacts. The results indicate that the crack initiation in lubricated contacts with surface damage is due to the accumulated plastic strain process. This model includes the crack initiation life. ^ Experimental studies on dent initiated spalling and spall initiation location were conducted. The experiments were performed on a ball-on-disk rolling/sliding contact tester and a ball-on-rod fatigue test machine. The experimental results verify the numerical model predictions and the significant life reduction to debris denting effects. ^ Finally, the residual stress effects due to debris denting were studied. The residual stresses are generated in the debris denting process and the <b>over-rolling</b> of dent process. The results indicates that the residual stress effects are strongly influenced by the material properties. ...|$|E

High frequency analysis indicated {{the condition of the}} bearings through the determination of an increase in the structural resonances of the system as the size of an artificial defect was increased. As higher loads were applied, frequencies around 100 kHz were excited, indicating the release of AE possibly attributed to friction and the plastic deformation as peaks, induced through engraving of the raceway, were <b>over-rolled</b> and worn down. Sensitivity of AE to this level in bearings indicates that detection of subsurface cracking may be possible in future work, providing early indication of incipient failure...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of fluid-saturated porous media is a challenging topic with applications in many engineering fields like, e. g., road and railway mechanics. The {{complexity of the}} problem requires high computational effort when performing simulations of the coupled dynamic deformation and fluid flow in a saturated porous medium. Different possibilities for reducing the computational cost {{are discussed in the}} thesis. The porous medium is modeled as a binary mixture of a solid matrix phase and a fluid phase, whereby the thermodynamically consistent so-called Porous Media Theory is adopted. Reduction of the computational effort is achieved through simplifications of the continuum (physical) model as well as a novel reformulation of the variational format. As to the adopted modeling, different simplifying approximations for the relative fluid acceleration are compared. From the numerical examples, it is concluded that the contribution from the convective part of the relative fluid acceleration may be neglected without significant loss of accuracy; however, neglecting the complete relative fluid acceleration may lead to detrimental loss of accuracy. A problem of significant engineering importance, to which the developed model has been applied, is the coupled dynamic deformation and water flow in soils subjected to <b>over-rolling</b> of a high-speed train. As to the choice of computational method for the fully dynamic response, a novel two-field variational format, with the seepage velocity treated as a "local" field, was developed and compared to the more commonly used three-field format. This leads to a substantial reduction of the computational effort for given accuracy. A pressure gradient dependent permeability coefficient was introduced in the constitutive model for the seepage velocity. This was done essentially to illustrate the effectiveness of algorithmic structure for a nonlinear model...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{issues regarding}} the modeling and numerical simulation of singular cracks and their propagation {{in the context}} of Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) in rails. Typically, such cracks are associated with squats and head-checks in the rail head. One characteristic feature, which is of particular concern in the thesis (and in the CHARMEC project MU 17), is that the propagation of RCF-related cracks takes place under significant influence of large plastic deformations. Another feature is that several cracks interact in a complex fashion due to the rotating stress state during each single <b>over-rolling.</b> The work is reported in two papers submitted for international publication: In Paper A the objective is to investigate geometric and material parameters that effect the interaction of multiple preexisting (initiated) cracks due to RCF loading conditions. Parameters of interest are: initial crack angle, initial crack spacing, distribution of initial crack length, load/contact zone in relation to spacing, FE-mesh sensitivity, and material properties (in particular the friction coefficient). An open question of particular interest is the effect of crack interaction, e. g. shielding, on the prevailing crack spacing. In view of all uncertainties of the material model as well as the three-dimensional geometric complexity of the RCF-problem, it is important to obtain a good understanding of the sensitivity of parameters. This is achieved in the presented investigation, although it is carried out using simplifying assumptions such as plane strain, linear elasticity, Hertzian pressure distribution, etc. Paper B focusses on the proper definition and computation of the ”crack-driving force” to be used in crack propagation modeling. The crack-driving force is defined {{in the context of}} ”material forces” (or configurational forces), which is a vectorial measure of the energy release rate due to a (virtual) variation of the position of the crack tip. A particular issue is the role of material dissipation that is induced by configurational changes, such as crack advancement. In this paper, we introduce two approximations for the relation between the rate of internal variables and the given rate of change of material configuration. We consider convergence from mesh refinement for the two different assumptions for the simple model problem of a plate with a pre-existing edge crack in a setting of small strains and isotropic hardening...|$|E
40|$|Rolling contact fatigue is a damage {{process that}} may arise in {{mechanical}} applications with repeated rolling contacts. Some examples are: gears; cams; bearings; rail/wheel contacts. The resulting damage is often visible {{with the naked}} eye as millimeter sized surface craters. The surface craters are here denoted spalls and the gear contact served as a case study. The work focused on the asperity point load mechanism for initiation of spalls. It was found that the stresses at asperity level may be large enough to initiate surface cracking, especially if the complete stress cycle was accounted for. The gear contact is often treated as a cylindrical contact. The thesis contains experimental and numerical results connected to rolling contact fatigue of cylindrical contacts. At the outset a stationary cylindrical contact was studied experimentally. The stationary test procedure was used instead of a rolling contact. In this way the number of contact parameters was minimized. The cylindrical contact resulted in four different contact fatigue cracks. The two cracks that appeared first initiated below the contact. The other two cracks developed at the contact surface when the number of load cycles and the contact load increased. The influence of a surface irregularity (asperity) was studied numerically with the Finite Element Method (FEM). Firstly, the stationary contact was modelled and investigated numerically. At the cylindrical contact boundary a single axisymmetric was included. The partially loaded asperity introduced a tensile surface stress, which seen from the asperity centre was radially directed. Secondly, FE simulations were performed where a single axisymmetric asperity was <b>over-rolled</b> by a cylindrical contact. The simulations were performed for pure rolling and rolling with slip. For both situations, tensile forward directed stresses in front of the asperity were found. The presence of slip and a surface traction greatly increased the stresses in front of the asperity. Finally, when rolling started from rest with applied slip, the distance to steady-state rolling was determined for elastic similar cylindrical rollers. QC 20100702 </p...|$|R
