40|$|The {{free-flying}} SCRAMSPACE I Mach 8 hypersonic flight experiment will {{be launched}} using a two-stage sounding rocket motor system (RMS) from the Andoya Test Range in Norway in June 2013. The vehicle will reach {{an altitude of}} approximately 100 km before detaching from the RMS, with the fuelled phase of the scramjet experiment occurring between 32 km- 27 km during the down-leg of the ballistic RMS trajectory. Satisfying the static stability requirements specified by the launch service provider when SCRAMSPACE {{is attached to the}} RMS whilst also maintaining an acceptable static stability margin during the free-flying phase of the mission is shown to be an interdisciplinary and multi-constraint design problem. Inviscid computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools have been used to perform a trade-off analysis between the competing requirements of the RMS and the desired SCRAMSPACE stability margins from launch until termination of the experiment. The placement of both vehicles 2 ̆ 7 (RMS and SCRAMSPACE) centre of gravity (CG) and centre of pressure (CoP) are a coupled problem, with the vehicle length, <b>outer</b> <b>mould</b> <b>line,</b> stability fin mass and shape all having a profound effect on the stability margin evolution over the trajectory. The second (Improved Orion) stage is found to be the critical flight phase for the RMS stability during ascent. The addition of 50 mm high strakes between the Improved Orion stability fins has been shown to ensure static stability throughout the ascent phase. The shape of the stability fins on the SCRAMSPACE vehicle has evolved to place the fin CoP as far aft as possible without interfering with the launch rail or RMS manacle band release mechanism.

40|$|In recent years, both Europe and the US are {{developing}} hypersonic research and operational vehicles. These include (re) entry capsules (both ballistic and lifting) and lifting bodies such as ExoMars, EXPERT, ARV, CEV and IXV. The research programs {{are meant to}} enable technology and engineering capabilities to support {{during the next decade}} the development of affordable (possibly reusable) space transportation systems as well as hypersonic weapons systems for time critical targets. These programs have a broad range of goals, ranging from the qualification of thermal protection systems, the assessment of RCS performances, the development of GNC algorithms, to the full demonstration of the performance and operability of the integrated vehicles. Since the aerothermodynamic characteristics influence nearly all elements of the vehicle design, the accurate prediction of the aerothermal environment is a prerequisite for the design of efficient hypersonic systems. Significant uncertainties in the prediction of the hypersonic aerodynamic and the aerothermal loads can lead to conservative margins {{in the design of the}} vehicle including its <b>Outer</b> <b>Mould</b> <b>Line</b> (OML), thermal protection system, structure, and required control system robustness. The current level of aerothermal prediction uncertainties results therefore in reduced vehicle performances (e. g., sub-optimal payload to mass ratio, increased operational constraints). On the other hand, present computational capabilities enable the simulation of three dimensional flow fields with complex thermo-chemical models over complete trajectories and ease the validation of these tools by, e. g., reconstruction of detailed wind tunnel tests performed under identified and controlled conditions (flow properties and vehicle attitude in particular). These controlled conditions are typically difficult to achieve when performing in flight measurements which in turn results in large associated measurement uncertainties. Similar problems arise when attempting to rebuild measurements performed in "hot" ground facilities, where the difficulty level is increased by the addition of the free-flow characterization itself. The implementation of ever more sophisticated thermochemical models is no obvious cure to the aforementioned problems since their effect is often overwhelmed by the large measurement uncertainties incurred in both flight and ground high enthalpy facilities. Concurrent to the previous considerations, a major contributor to the overall vehicle mass of re-entry vehicles is the afterbody thermal protection system. This is due to the large acreage (equal or bigger than that of the forebody) to be protected. The present predictive capabilities for base flows are comparatively lower than those for windward flowfields and offer therefore a substantial potential for improving the design of future re-entry vehicles. To that end, it is essential to address the accuracy of high fidelity CFD tools exercised in the US and EU, which motivates a thorough investigation of the present status of hypersonic flight afterbody heating. This paper addresses the predictive capabilities of after body flow fields of re-entry vehicles investigated in the frame of the NATO/RTO - RTG- 043 Task Group and is structured as follows: First, the verification of base flow topologies on the basis of available wind-tunnel results performed under controlled supersonic conditions (i. e., cold flows devoid of reactive effects) is performed. Such tests address the detailed characterization of the base flow with particular emphasis on separation/reattachment and their relation to Mach number effects. The tests have been performed on an Apollo-like re-entry capsule configuration. Second, the tools validated in the frame of the previous effort are exercised and appraised against flight-test data collected during the Apollo AS- 202 re-entry...|$|E
40|$|The {{outsourcing}} {{that has}} taken place in the aircraft industry over the last few decades has created a globalized supply chain from and to a limited number of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This has led to multi-level design due to the shift from airframe subsystem design to suppliers. Increasingly OEMs focus on requirement allocation and definition of airframe subsystems and verification at a global level, whereas suppliers focus on the realization and improvement of airframe subsystems at the local level. Relying on a supply chain for innovative designs and builds can cause OEMs to have insufficient bottom-up knowledge about subsystem design, in particular, the innovative local designs, e. g. composites and new production methods, however, in the overall aircraft conceptual design phase, the analysis and evaluation of different subsystem designs, by OEM internally, rely heavily on assumptions and estimations which are usually based on statistical/empirical data. Although global designs can be quickly analyzed using assumptions and estimates, this risks costly design changes if the assumptions and estimations are proven incorrect in the later overall aircraft design phases. Suppliers who have detail-level knowledge should be involved early in the overall aircraft conceptual design phase, creating various local designs, and conducting more accurate analyses and evaluations of these designs. Early local design studies can help suppliers help OEMs {{to reduce the risk of}} design changes related to incorrect assumptions and estimations, and convince OEMs of the benefits of new material and new production methods. The objective of this research was to develop a design approach which can support suppliers to perform local design fast from which critical results, i. e. cost and weight, can be generated during the overall aircraft conceptual design phase. A fast airframe subsystem design is highly beneficial for suppliers wishing to increase their competiveness, providing fast response and being flexible in the overall aircraft conceptual design phase. It is also beneficial for OEMs to reduce the risk of design changes due to incorrect assumptions and estimations. Several issues in the current design process that hamper a fast study of airframe subsystems were identified in this research, some of which have to be addressed from the supplier’s side. 1) The dependency of suppliers on the OEMs to get coherent, consistent and timely design information, e. g. geometry and load cases, needed to start local design. This dependency causes suppliers wait until all the required information is available from the OEMs in the overall aircraft preliminary design phase. Therefore, the suppliers cannot proactively participate in the overall aircraft conceptual design, in which the airframe subsystem design relies heavily on assumptions and estimations. 2) The manual processes used by suppliers to update computer aided design (CAD) and analysis models to follow design changes at the global and local level. In the overall aircraft conceptual design phase, both the global and local design are not fixed yet and tend to change. Manually model updating at local design level takes significant engineering efforts, and hence slows down the supplier’s response to the changes in the global design. 3) There is a lack of multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) capability and capacity at a local design level due to this lack of MDO knowledge and a lack of tools to build parametric product and process models. Therefore, in the short conceptual design phase, suppliers often just deliver a (few) feasible design solution(s) instead of a family of Pareto design solutions. To address these issues, and hence to increase supplier competitiveness, a global-local knowledge coupling approach is proposed, which comprises two modules at the global and local design level. The module at global design level is the cross-over, which is used as a substitute for global design and provides the inputs required for starting a local design. The cross-over is used to make the global and local designs concurrent in the early aircraft design phase. The module at the local design level is a set of parametric product and process models of airframe subsystems used to automate repetitive design actions at local design level, such that the analysis and evaluation of subsystem designs can be quickly performed. Knowledge based engineering (KBE) is adopted to implement the two modules for two main purposes: 1) parameterization of product models that allows automatic model (re) generation; 2) automation of pre-processing to prepare inputs for disciplinary analysis tools. Multidisciplinary design optimization is used as the technical implementation mean of the proposed approach to automate the process of finding an optimal design for a complex airframe subsystem. Three demonstration systems are developed, each of them formed as a design framework, called the Airframe Design and Engineering Engine (ADEE), which is a specialized Design and Engineering Engine (DEE). The design and engineering engine (Tooren, 2003) is a MDO system aimed at supporting and accelerating the design process of complex products, through the automation of non-creative and repetitive design activities. The verification design systems are the fuselage ADEE, the fuselage panel ADEE and the movable ADEE. One of the main contributions of this research is to identify the issues in the airframe design process which involves OEM and suppliers, and how these issues can be solved for quickly performing local design in the aircraft conceptual design phase. Another contribution lies in the development of the global-local knowledge coupling approach and its demonstration systems for the new design approach, which provide tools and methods to address these issues. Each verification tool is an ADEE, which is supported by KBE to perform global design and local design in an automatic fashion, such that cross-over can quickly generate the required inputs for local design and the local design module can quickly generate and analyse various subsystem design variants. The fuselage ADEE is used to address issue 1 by increasing design independence for panel suppliers The fuselage ADEE is implemented as a cross-over, in which finite element analysis (FEA) based weight estimation is developed to capture the effects of material and structural layout on fuselage weight. The global knowledge is captured in the cross-over, including the knowledge of how to generate fuselage <b>outer</b> <b>mould</b> <b>line</b> (OML) and knowledge of how to perform disciplinary analysis such as load calculation and structural analysis using FEA. The ADEE is validated using data from fuselages of conventional aircraft such as the ATR 42, Fokker 100, Boeing 737 - 200, Airbus A 320 - 200 and Airbus A 300 B 2. The fuselage ADEE is also used to estimate fuselage weight of a joint wing aircraft. The fuselage panel ADEE is used to address issue 2 by automating repetitive model (re) generation for local design The fuselage panel ADEE is the local design module of the global-local knowledge coupling, which comprises a parametric panel product model and disciplinary analysis models, i. e. structural analysis, cost estimation and weight evaluation models. The fuselage ADEE is a cross-over which provides inputs for the fuselage panel ADEE. A KBE-enabled parametric panel product model is implemented in the fuselage panel ADEE to model various configurations of fuselage panels flexibly, which are composed of skin with multiple layers and back-up structural members, such as frames and stringers. These structural members are modeled based on the OML generated by the fuselage ADEE. The structural analysis uses global-local FEA in which a global FE model is obtained from the cross-over to predict the overall fuselage behavior, whereas a refined FE panel model is built for investigating panel behavior. The local panel process knowledge is captured in the panel ADEE so as to automate the panel modeling, structural analysis, parametric bottom-up cost estimation and weight evaluation. Using the accelerated local panel design process, the local panel design can quickly respond to the change of global design, while the model consistency between global and local levels can be guaranteed. The movable ADEE is used to address issue 3 by automating repetitive design actions in the MDO process The movable ADEE is developed to perform cost/weight multi-objective optimization of movable structures, e. g. rudders and elevators, including large topology variations of the structural configuration. The KBE-enabled modelling module of this ADEE is able to model very different product configurations and variants and extract all data required to feed the weight and cost estimation modules, in a fully automated fashion. The weight estimation method uses FEA to calculate the internal stresses of the structural elements and an analytical composite plate sizing method to determine their minimum required thicknesses. The manufacturing cost estimation module was developed on the basis of a cost model available in the literature. The capability of the framework is successfully demonstrated by designing and optimizing the composite structure of a business jet rudder. The study case indicates that this ADEE is able to find the Pareto optimal set for minimum structural weight and manufacturing cost quickly. The demonstration systems developed demonstrate that the global-local knowledge coupling approach can support suppliers wishing to perform fast airframe subsystem design in the overall aircraft conceptual design phase.

In this technique, which has also been used in ancient Chinese bronze-casting, a clay model of the sculpture is made {{and covered with a}} new layer of clay after drying. This outer layer of clay is then cut into pieces and removed before it dries completely.

Experiments are conducted using a cylindrical casting to study this effect for different sands (silica and zircon) and different sand binder systems (phenolic urethane and sodium silicate). The type of sand has a significant effect on the final casting dimensions, in particular because the expansion of silica sand can be irreversible. The sand expansion effect is enhanced by the presence of sodium silicate binder. In addition, the size of the core, which in the present experiments controls the amount of steel in the mould and thus the heat input to the mould, strongly affects the internal and external dimensions of the resulting casting. A combined casting and stress simulation code is used to predict the dimensional changes of the castings. In several cases, the pattern allowances are predicted successfully both for free and hindered shrinkage cases.

In case of the ribs for the LOCOMACHS Lean Assembly Wing Box, geometrical accuracy was {{as important as the}} laminate quality itself and therefore a variety of measures has been investigated to actively measure and tune all quality relevant production parameters. The process that has been chosen to produce the ribs is a combination of resin infusion and autoclave technology because this combination offers a wide bandwidth of process parameter variation. The rib design with one integrated rib foot and one integrated rib post has been offered a good combination of simplicity and degree of structural integration. Since the <b>mould</b> <b>line</b> is not critical from a CTE point of view it was possible to use a cost efficient aluminium male tooling which has been designed to produce two different ribs in one cycle. Flange angle of the rib foot and rib post have been designed to compensate “Spring-In” deformations in a formally defined production window. Process-induced distortions (PID) of the ribs have been predicted with a novel pheno-numerical simulation approach that has been introduced within the LOCOMACHS project. The methodology provides efficient PID predictions due to shell-element modeling and a significant reduction of corresponding simulation parameters. To ensure that all quality relevant production parameters are in the specified production window a network of ultrasonic sensors has been installed in a special pattern. A crucial advantage of the ultrasonic sensors is that they are installed on the accessible backside of the mould and do not affect the <b>mould</b> <b>line</b> side. By measuring and analyzing sound amplitudes and propagation times it was possible to monitor flow front propagation, laminate thickness and also the cure progress in the running process. To manipulate the process conditions {{on the basis of the}} gained information, the injection pressure of the two injection lines could be used to tune resin flow, the pressure difference between autoclave and injection system could be used to control laminate thickness and the temperature profile can be manipulated in function of the cure progress. The ability to compensate most of the typical production scatter problems is major step towards the formally defined target of reproducible, high product quality. Furthermore the overall process time is no longer restricted to predefined, highly conservative cure times since the degree of cure is directly measured...|$|R

A tiled inscription on the <b>outer</b> cavetto <b>moulding</b> runs up one side, {{across the top}} and {{down the other side}} of the mihrab. The cuerda seca cavetto tiles have raised white naskh characters which contrast with the cobalt blue background. Running through the shafts of the naskh characters is a second inscription in yellow Kufic characters. Some of the text on the left side is simply a mirror image of that on the right. The inscriptions include text from the Quran (3:32 - 3:35) and a dedication to Sultan Murad II who ruled between 1421-1444 and again from 1446-1451.|$|R
40|$|Rotational {{moulding}} is {{a process}} {{with a range of}} unique benefits, currently experiencing significant growth within industry. A primary limitation of the process, however, is the restricted range of suitable materials and the subsequent limitations placed upon the mechanical performance of rotationally moulded products. The aim of this research project was to develop a rotational moulding material which possessed substantially improved mechanical properties over conventional, rotationally moulded polyethylene grades. This was attempted through the development of a fibre-reinforced thermoplastic composite which was amenable to the rotational moulding process. Although the development of rotationally moulded composites has been previously reported in literature, these materials have largely proven to be unsatisfactory in terms of mechanical performance. The composite material developed here is distinct from those previously reported in that it utilises melt-compounded composite granules of a significantly larger size than are normally considered suitable for rotational moulding. These granules are intended to be moulded as an inner layer within a rotationally moulded product, with the <b>outer</b> <b>moulded</b> layer formed from conventional, unfilled polymer powder. In this way, the average length of the fibres within the moulded article is maximised while retaining the benefits of the melt-compounding process and giving an excellent external moulded finish. In order to achieve a sufficient degree of composite granule flow and coalescence during rotational moulding, it was found necessary to base the composite granules on high melt-flow, injection moulding grades of polypropylene and polyethylene. The most successful of the resultant composite materials was shown to be superior to the previously utilised rotational moulding grade of unfilled, high-density polyethylene by approximately 65 % in offset yield strength (0. 5 % offset) and over 95 % in tensile modulus...|$|R
50|$|In making Cheddar (or {{many other}} hard cheeses) the curd is {{cut into small}} cubes and the {{temperature}} is raised to approximately.39 C to 'scald' the curd particles. Syneresis occurs and cheese whey is expressed from the particles. The Cheddar curds and whey are often transferred from the cheese vat to a cooling table which contains screens that allow the whey to drain, but which trap the curd. The curd is cut using long, blunt knives and 'blocked' (stacked, cut and turned) by the cheesemaker to promote the release of cheese whey in {{a process known as}} 'cheddaring'. During this process the acidity of the curd increases and when the cheesemaker is satisfied it has reached the required level, around 0.65%, the curd is milled into ribbon shaped pieces and salt is mixed into it to arrest acid development. The salted green cheese curd is put into cheese <b>moulds</b> <b>lined</b> with cheesecloths and pressed overnight to allow the curd particles to bind together. The pressed blocks of cheese are then removed from the cheese moulds and are either bound with muslin-like cloth, or waxed or vacuum packed in plastic bags to be stored for maturation. Vacuum packing removes oxygen and prevents mould (fungal) growth during maturation, which depending on the wanted final product may be a desirable characteristic or not.|$|R
50|$|The coping {{line of the}} parapet {{walls to}} the side and rear facades of the {{extension}} has been matched to an upper <b>moulding</b> <b>line</b> on the front section of the building. While a rendered plinth line has been created on these facades, its level does not match that of the front section. Its width diminishes over the gentle slope from East Lane to Bolsover Street. Rendered strips mark each line established by the heads and sills of the windows in these facades. The extent of render modelling has been greatly parred down, compared to the building's front section. Each of the long side facades- one addressing Market Lane and the other a paved and treed avenue- has three gated entry points. The first set is located adjacent to the front section of the building, while the other two sets divide the remaining facade areas evenly. On each facade, these two openings are framed by rendered pilasters and topped by a triangular rise in the parapet. A number of double-hung sash windows are set in the walls between the various entries. On the rear facade, in the northern corner, there is a double door accessed via a short flight of metal stairs and overhung by a small metal shade roof. There are also four louvred windows with high sill levels.|$|R
