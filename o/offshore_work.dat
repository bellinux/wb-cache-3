The ownership {{and management of the}} Finnish multipurpose icebreakers was transferred to a subsidiary company, Arctia Offshore Oy. Botnica was not contracted for icebreaking during the winter season of 2010, and having been left without a charter for <b>offshore</b> <b>work,</b> she was laid up in Trieste, Italy. While during the particularly harsh winter of 2011 Botnica was again employed as an icebreaker in the Baltic Sea, her icebreaking contract was not renewed for the 2012 season — instead the Finnish Transport Agency decided to charter Zeus, a small icebreaking anchor handling tug supply vessel (AHTS) owned by the Finnish towing and salvage company Alfons Håkans, until 2016. The agency also entered a similar agreement with a large Swedish icebreaker.|$|E

40|$|Based on Relational Exchange Theory (RET), {{this paper}} explores the dual role in {{offshore}} sourcing as experienced by an Irish software development company. As {{part of a}} large U.

Hence, the Irish site has experience of being both customer and vendor in an IS offshoring relationship. The study reveals elements for a successful offshoring relationship and presents lessons learnt from the dual “bridge ” role that emerged in our study. Furthermore, it is questioned whether this bridge role will be a viable model also in future offshoring arrangements.

50|$|The Statnamic weight packs usually {{consist of}} steel or {{concrete}} rings {{placed over the}} Statnamic silencer. As the device does not rely on gravity to apply loads as in static or drop weight testing {{it can be used}} vertically, horizontally and inclined to test raked piles. The ability to test horizontally has led to the method being used for lateral load testing of piles and simulation of ship impacts on mooring bodies (Middendorp, 2000). In order to improve the flexibility of the device and minimise transportation costs for <b>offshore</b> <b>works</b> a device has also been tested that can apply up to 14MN using water as a reaction mass. This is achieved in an over water pile tests by connected the Statnamic device to a vessel full of water below the water bodies surface (Middendorp, 2000), thus removing the need for heavy reaction weights.|$|R
