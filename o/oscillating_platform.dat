The <b>oscillating</b> <b>platform</b> is modeled as a linear spring-damper-mass oscillator with two perpendicular degrees of freedom.

40|$|Vibration {{treatment}} by <b>oscillating</b> <b>platforms</b> {{is more and}} more employed in the fields of exercise physiology and bone research. The rationale of this treatment is based on the neuromuscular system response elicited by vibration loads [1, 6]. Surface Electromyography (EMG) is largely utilized to assess muscular response elicited by vibrations and Root Mean Square (RMS) of the electromyography signals is often used as a concise quantitative index of muscle activity; in general, EMG envelope or RMS is expected to increase during vibration [1]. However, {{it is well known that}} during surface bio-potential recording, motion artifacts may arise from relative motion between electrodes and skin and between skin layers. Also the only skin stretch, modifying the internal charge distribution, results in a variation of electrode potential [2, 4]. The aim of this study is to highlight the movements of muscles, and the succeeding relevance of motion artifacts on electrodes, in subjects undergoing vibration treatments. EMGs from quadriceps of fifteen subjects were recorded during vibration at different frequencies (15 - 40 Hz); Triaxial accelerometers were placed onto quadriceps, as close as possible to electrodes, to monitor motion. The muscle displacements showed a peculiar behaviour reflecting the mechanical properties of the structures involved. Motion artifact related to the impressed vibration have been recognized and related to movement of the soft tissues. Signals spectra also revealed sharp peaks corresponding to vibration frequency and its superior harmonics, in accordance with accelerometers data. The knowledge of skin motion could help in a better description of motion artifact origin and in filter-out motion-related electrode signals...|$|R

The aim of this work is to present a review about the published papers found in the PubMed in which there are information about the use of the whole body vibration (WBV) in postmenopausal women. As the increase of scientific interest in postmenopausal is evident, it was also evaluated, in the PubMed, the number of publications (NP) related with postmenopausal, some modalities of treatment and possible symptoms. The NP found in the PubMed in three keywords {{that can be used to}} study phenomena related with old women. It is verified that with the term menopause is found the biggest NP in the PubMed. The symptom with the biggest scientific interest, considering the NP is the hot flashes. A limited NP involving WBV exercises is found, that was bigger with postmenopausal than menopause. It is observed a strong interest in the studies involving osteoporosis and BMD. A small NP in menopause or postmenopausal with keywords involving BMD or osteoporosis and WBV was found. Twenty-six publications were analyzed and thirteen of them were common in at least two analyses. Eight papers were selected to be discussed. In general, all the authors agree that the WBV exercise can be a suitable therapeutic for preventing/reversing sarcopenia and possibly osteoporosis.

In addition to the act of pizza tossing, the vibro-impact system described above also applies to a class of standing-wave ultrasonic motors, which operates by tossing the rotor at rates above 20 kHz. Through numerical simulations, we investigate the performance of different pizza tossing techniques by varying the amplitude ratio (L) and the phase lag (θ) between the vertical and rotational component of the <b>oscillating</b> <b>platform.</b> Our results show that the energy efficiency and the rotational speed are maximized when L ≃ 1, and θ = 0...|$|E

The reference to be tracked is given by a sum of a constant and a fixed number of sinusoidal signals, and it is assumed not {{to be available to}} the controller. This represents a possible situation in which the controller is required to synchronize the vehicle motion with that of an <b>oscillating</b> <b>platform,</b> such as the deck of a ship in high seas.

Unlike non-jittering displays, jittering displays produced a situation of sustained visual - vestibular conflict. Contrary to the prevailing notion that visual - vestibular conflict impairs vection, jittering optic flow was found to produce shorter vection onsets and longer vection durations than non-jittering optic flow for all of jitter magnitudes and temporal frequencies examined. On the basis of these findings, it would appear that purely radial patterns of optic flow are not the optimal inducing stimuli for vection. Rather, flow patterns which contain both regular and random-oscillating components appear to produce the most compelling subjective experiences of self-motion...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{whole body}} {{vibration}} (WBV) {{has been the}} subject of a great amount of research towards improving physical capabilities as a postactivation potentiation because the muscle spindle’s sensitivity can be increased (Rittweger, 2010).

Previous reports have shown that WBV produces preconditioning effects that lead an increase of power and flexibility (Jacobs 2 ̆ 6 Burns, 2009), but controversial data exists that have shown no positive effect if an optimal dosage is not used in a controlled manner (Wilcock et al., 2009) and it has been suggested that the frequency may affect output (Turner et al., 2011).

40|$|Whole Body Vibration {{training}} {{is more and}} more utilized in sport medicine to enhance athletic performance and training; recently, vibration treatment is being also used for therapy and rehabilitation for patients affected by different pathologies. It is also worth mention that excessive vibrations can be hazardous. The treatment is based on the hypothesis that under some circumstances vibration loads induce specific responses from the neuromuscular system; some clinical evidences suggest mechanical and metabolic reaction. Usually, vibrations are transmitted by means of a <b>platform</b> <b>oscillating</b> at different frequencies (10 - 80 Hz) to patient body; mainly, limb muscles are involved. Many studies about the subject employ surface EMG recordings to evaluate muscle activity during vibration training. On electrodes, this condition generates large motion artifact at the vibration frequency. To get rid of such artifact an adaptive filter was designed: accelerometers placed onto platform or directly on muscles provide an error signal shape to be cancelled from the raw EMG. In particular, surface EMG have been recorded from leg quadriceps muscles of volunteers during whole body vibration therapy sessions at different oscillating frequency. A standard RLS adaptive filter have been used to cancel the motion artifact from EMG in real-time. Results show the effective cancellations of the vibration frequency from the raw EMG; the RMS value of the cleaned EMG results lower than that unprocessed in some cases up to 50 %...|$|R
40|$|Diffusion and {{convection}} are {{the main}} physical processes in crystal growth and metallurgy. On ground, the measured diffusion coefficients of liquids are often enlarged due to the additional mass transport of the natural convection especially at high temperatures.

The influence of vibrations on liquid transport experiments was investigated quantitatively in a model heat transport experiment using hot and warm water during three ESA parabolic campaigns. A reflight with a further developed experimental set-up was performed during ESA PFC 39 in March 2005. The goal was to minimize the transport induced by the starting of the experiment. Two different methods to start the experiments were used: the shear cell method and the flowing junction cell method.

40|$|The {{use of a}} free <b>oscillating</b> <b>platform</b> {{for balance}} {{training}} is widespread. However, {{there is a lack}} of variables used when analyzing these measurement results. The aim of this study was to introduce and evaluate a new variable.

Overall the directional ratio showed weak correlation with the damping ratio (r = - 0. 05) and the time of balance regain (r = - 0. 08), suggesting new information content. One-legged stances had significantly lower damping ratio (p = 0. 013) and directional ratio values (p < 0. 00), showing more anterior-posterior movement and elliptical trajectories.

Methods: Computerized literature searches were performed using the PubMed databases. Results: A strong interest in studies, considering the number of publications, involving CF and lung was found. Although, the exercises and physical activities seem to have a high relevance in the management of the patients with CF, the number of publications involving these procedures is limited. Moreover, a modality of exercise involving WBV seems to be poorly utilized by the patients with CF and only two papers were found with positive actions.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigate}} a control mechanism that dampens hand vibrations. Here, we propose a control method with two components to suppress hand vibrations. The {{first is a}} passive suppression method that lowers the joint stiffness to passively dampen the hand vibrations. The second is an active suppression method that adjusts an equilibrium point based on skyhook control to actively dampen the hand vibrations. In a simulation ex-periment, we applied these two methods to dampen hand vibrations during the shoulder’s horizontal oscillation. We also conducted a measurement experiment wherein a subject’s shoulder was sinusoidally <b>oscillated</b> by a <b>platform</b> that generated horizontal oscillations. The results of the measurement experiments showed that the jerk of {{each part of the}} arm in a task using a cup filled with water was smaller than the shoulder jerk and that in a task with a cup filled with stones was larger than the shoulder jerk. Moreover, the amplitude of the hand trajectory in both horizontal and vertical directions was smaller in a task using a cup filled with water than in a task using a cup filled with stones. The results of the measurement experiments were accurately reproduced by the active suppression method based on sky-hook control. These results suggest that humans dampen hand vibrations by controlling the equilibrium point through the information of the external workspace and the internal body state rather than by lowering joint stiffness only by using internal information...|$|R

Basictheory needed to calculate the forces acting on floating structures is presented. The main motivation for the thesis is to investigate the feasibility of includingfrequency dependent added mass and damping in USFOS. USFOS is a computerprogram originally developed to simulate the response to extreme environmentaland accidental loads for fixed offshore structures. The program has been modified tobe able to handle also floating offshore structures. Floating structures are howeversubjected to diffraction and radiation terms often simulated as added mass anddamping terms. So far, these terms {{are assumed to be}} constant in USFOS. Thisis not correct, as the added mass and damping terms are frequency dependentin reality. The frequency dependence can be accounted for by adding memoryfunctions expressed as convolution integrals. The convolution terms are integrated from 0 to t, i. e. from the beginning of timeand up to this moment. This is neither possible, due to computer restrictions, nornecessary, due to damping effects.

40|$|Human {{reactions}} to vibration have been extensively investigated in the past. Vibration, {{as well as}} whole-body vibration (WBV), has been commonly considered as an occupational hazard for its detrimental effects on human condition and comfort. Although long term exposure to vibrations may produce undesirable side-effects, {{a great part of}} the literature is dedicated to the positive effects of WBV when used as method for muscular stimulation and as an exercise intervention. Whole body vibration training (WBVT) aims to mechanically activate muscles by eliciting neuromuscular activity (muscle reflexes) via the use of vibrations delivered to the whole body. The most mentioned mechanism to explain the neuromuscular outcomes of vibration is the elicited neuromuscular activation. Local tendon vibrations induce activity of the muscle spindle Ia fibers, mediated by monosynaptic and polysynaptic pathways: a reflex muscle contraction known as the Tonic Vibration Reflex (TVR) arises in response to such vibratory stimulus. In WBVT mechanical vibrations, in a range from 10 to 80 Hz and peak to peak displacements from 1 to 10 mm, are usually transmitted to the patient body by the use of <b>oscillating</b> <b>platforms.</b> Vibrations are then transferred from the platform to a specific muscle group through the subject body. To customize WBV treatments, surface electromyography (SEMG) signals are often used to reveal the best stimulation frequency for each subject. Use of SEMG concise parameters, such as root mean square values of the recordings, is also a common practice; frequently a preliminary session can take place in order to discover the more appropriate stimulation frequency. Soft tissues act as wobbling masses vibrating in a damped manner in response to mechanical excitation; Muscle Tuning hypothesis suggest that neuromuscular system works to damp the soft tissue oscillation that occurs in response to vibrations; muscles alters their activity to dampen the vibrations, preventing any resonance phenomenon. Muscle response to vibration is however a complex phenomenon as it depends on different parameters, like muscle-tension, muscle or segment-stiffness, amplitude and frequency of the mechanical vibration. Additionally, while in the TVR study the applied vibratory stimulus and the muscle conditions are completely characterised (a known vibration source is applied directly to a stretched/shortened muscle or tendon), in WBV study only the stimulus applied to a distal part of the body is known. Moreover, mechanical response changes in relation to the posture. The transmissibility of vibratory stimulus along the body segment strongly depends on the position held by the subject. The aim of this work was the investigation on the effects that the use of vibrations, in particular the effects of whole body vibrations, may have on muscular activity. A new approach to discover the more appropriate stimulus frequency, by the use of accelerometers, was also explored. Different subjects, not affected by any known neurological or musculoskeletal disorders, were voluntarily involved in the study and gave their informed, written consent to participate. The device used to deliver vibration to the subjects was a vibrating platform. Vibrations impressed by the platform were exclusively vertical; platform displacement was sinusoidal with an intensity (peak-to-peak displacement) set to 1. 2 mm and with a frequency ranging from 10 to 80 Hz. All the subjects familiarized with the device and the proper positioning. Two different posture were explored in this study: position 1 - hack squat; position 2 - subject standing on toes with heels raised. SEMG signals from the Rectus Femoris (RF), Vastus Lateralis (VL) and Vastus medialis (VM) were recorded. SEMG signals were amplified using a multi-channel, isolated biomedical signal amplifier The gain was set to 1000 V/V and a band pass filter (- 3 dB frequency 10 - 500 Hz) was applied; no notch filters were used to suppress line interference. Tiny and lightweight (less than 10 g) three-axial MEMS accelerometers (Freescale semiconductors) were used to measure accelerations of onto patient’s skin, at EMG electrodes level. Accelerations signals provided information related to individuals’ RF, Biceps Femoris (BF) and Gastrocnemius Lateralis (GL) muscle belly oscillation; they were pre-processed in order to exclude influence of gravity. As demonstrated by our results, vibrations generate peculiar, not negligible motion artifact on skin electrodes. Artifact amplitude is generally unpredictable; it appeared in all the quadriceps muscles analysed, but in different amounts. Artifact harmonics extend throughout the EMG spectrum, making classic high-pass filters ineffective; however, their contribution was easy to filter out from the raw EMG signal with a series of sharp notch filters centred at the vibration frequency and its superior harmonics (1. 5 Hz wide). However, use of these simple filters prevents the revelation of EMG power potential variation in the mentioned filtered bands. Moreover our experience suggests that the possibility of reducing motion artefact, by using particular electrodes and by accurately preparing the subject’s skin, is not easily viable; even though some small improvements were obtained, {{it was not possible to}} substantially decrease the artifact. Anyway, getting rid of those artifacts lead to some true EMG signal loss. Nevertheless, our preliminary results suggest that the use of notch filters at vibration frequency and its harmonics is suitable for motion artifacts filtering. In RF SEMG recordings during vibratory stimulation only a little EMG power increment should be contained in the mentioned filtered bands due to synchronous electromyographic activity of the muscle. Moreover, it is better to remove the artifact that, in our experience, was found to be more than 40 % of the total signal power. In summary, many variables have to be taken into account: in addition to amplitude, frequency and duration of vibration treatment, other fundamental variables were found to be subject anatomy, individual physiological condition and subject’s positioning on the platform. Studies on WBV treatments that include surface EMG analysis to asses muscular activity during vibratory stimulation should take into account the presence of motion artifacts. Appropriate filtering of artifacts, to reveal the actual effect on muscle contraction elicited by vibration stimulus, is mandatory. However as a result of our preliminary study, a simple multi-band notch filtering may help to reduce randomness of the results. Muscle tuning hypothesis seemed to be confirmed. Our results suggested that the effects of WBV are linked to the actual muscle motion (displacement). The greater was the muscle belly displacement the higher was found the muscle activity. The maximum muscle activity has been found in correspondence with the local mechanical resonance, suggesting a more effective stimulation at the specific system resonance frequency. Holding the hypothesis that muscle activation is proportional to muscle displacement, treatment optimization could be obtained by simply monitoring local acceleration (resonance). However, our study revealed some short term effects of vibratory stimulus; prolonged studies should be assembled in order to consider the long term effectiveness of these results. Since local stimulus depends on the kinematic chain involved, WBV muscle stimulation has to take into account the transmissibility of the stimulus along the body segment in order to ensure that vibratory stimulation effectively reaches the target muscle. Combination of local resonance and muscle response should also be further investigated to prevent hazards to individuals undergoing WBV treatments...|$|R

Simultaneous recordings from quadriceps Rectus Femoris EMG and 3 D muscle accelerations on fifteen subjects undergoing vibration treatments were collected. In our study vibrations were delivered via a sinusoidal <b>oscillating</b> <b>platform</b> at different frequencies (10 - 45 Hz), with a constant amplitude. Muscle motion was estimated by processing accelerometer data. Displacements revealed a mechanical resonant-like behaviour of the muscle; resonance frequencies and dumping factors depended on subject. Large EMG motion artifacts were removed using sharp notch filters centred at the vibration frequency and its superior harmonics. RMS values of artifact-free EMG were found correlated to the actual muscle displacement. The results were in accordance to the hypothesis of a proprioceptive response during vibration treatment. Nevertheless, motion artifacts produced an overestimation of muscle activity, therefore its removal was essential. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel and practical recovery procedure for automatic landing of a Rotorcraft Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (RUAV) {{operating in a}} rough sea environment. An effective sensor fusion algorithm using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is developed to accurately estimate deck displacement based on measurements from on-board multi-sensors (inertial sensor, GPS, and Tracking Sensor (TS)). A modified recursive Prony Analysis (PA) procedure is outlined to build up an appropriate model aiming to extract the monotonous trend of deck displacement, in which parameters are identified through implementing the Forgetting Factor Recursive Least Square (FFRLS) method. Addition-ally, a feasible threshold criterion is proposed to separate the dominant components, which results in an accurate instantaneous estimation of the mean deck displacement. Further-more, a feasible flight control system is designed to adjust positions and attitudes of the RUAV to instantaneously track the estimated mean deck displacement so that a smooth landing operation can be achieved. A closed-loop high-fidelity simulation system has been constructed to realize the proposed landing procedure. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed landing procedure exhibits satisfactory performance when real deck dis-placement data are applied, making the RUAV land safely on an <b>oscillating</b> <b>platform</b> in rough seas.

40|$|This {{series of}} studies used an <b>oscillating</b> <b>platform</b> {{paradigm}} to investigate the effects of aging on anticipatory and reactive mechanisms of postural control. We hypothesized that young adults would use anticipatory mechanisms in response to predictable postural perturbations and that aging would be characterized by a decrease in anticipatory postural muscle activity resulting in less effective balance control. Young and old healthy adults were asked to maintain standing balance on a force platform that oscillated continuously 20 cm peak-to-peak in the anterior/posterior (A/P) direction at successively increasing frequencies of 0. 1, 0. 25, 0. 5 to 0. 61 Hz. Subjects completed trials of externally- and self-triggered perturbations. The effect of mechanical stimulation of the foot plantar surface boundaries on postural responses of older adults was tested. Postural responses to perturbations were characterized using centre of pressure (COP), centre of mass (COM), muscle activity (EMG) and number of steps. A mathematical model representing the body motion in response to continuous sinusoidal platform perturbations was implemented. Young adults used anticipatory adjustments regardless {{of the degree of}} predictability of postural challenges in externally- and self-triggered perturbations. Old adults responded to a predictable externally-triggered postural challenge using reactive postural adjustments independent of the frequency of platform oscillation, the direction of perturbation and without adapting over multiple trials. Old adults used anticipatory adjustments only in self-triggered perturbations or when additional sensory stimulation from foot plantar surface boundaries was available. The present series of experiments demonstrated {{for the first time that}} cutaneous stimulation of the foot plantar surface boundaries increases stability and facilitates the use of anticipatory control strategies. These results support the importance of cutaneous mechanoreceptors at the boundaries of the foot plantar surface for the control of postural reactions evoked by continuous perturbations. The results from these experiments clearly show that the ability to compensate for an impending and highly predictable perturbation decreases with aging. The age-related difference in the control of standing balance on a continuous <b>oscillating</b> <b>platform</b> recorded in experimental data was partially explained through increased levels of sensory noise and neural delays in the simulated data of old adults. Our results support the concept of a dynamic stability, according to which, in addition to the horizontal location of the COM with respect to the base of support, the magnitude and direction of its corresponding velocity provide critical information pertaining to one's ability to control balance. Based on model work, we demonstrated that the acceleration parameters of a perturbation must be taken into account when calculating stability limits. We derived for the first time the equations for calculating these stability limits related to continuous translations of the base of support...|$|E
40|$|Whole-body {{vibration}} (WBV) {{has been}} suggested to be particularly effective on the stretch-shortening cycle-based movements, such as the counter movement jump (CMJ) test (Issurin, 2005). Nevertheless, the literature on short-term vibration exposure and lower limb explosive performance (measured by CMJ test) is contradictory. Either transient improvements (Bosco et al., 2000; Cochrane and Stannard, 2005; Torvinen et al., 2002 a) or no effects (Torvinen et al., 2002 b; Rittweger et al., 2003; Cormie et al., 2006) have been reported after a single WBV exposure ranging from 30 s to 10 min. The present study aimed at better characterizing {{the use of a}} single short bout of WBV as a mode of warming up before a CMJ test. A total of 114 university students (37 men, 77 women, aged 19. 6 ± 2. 0 years) signed an informed consent form and volunteered to participate in the study. The study protocol was approved by the Review Committee for Research Involving Human Subjects of our center. Participants were asked to come to the laboratory in three occasions three days apart. First visit: familiarization session aiming to learn the CMJ technique and to experience the vibration stimulus. Second visit: the participants performed three consecutive CMJ with one min rest interval. No significant differences were observed among the jumps, and the highest score was retained. Third visit: the participants were exposed to a single short bout of WBV and immediately after they performed three CMJ with one min rest interval. An infrared contact timing platform (ERGO JUMP Plus - BOSCO SYSTEM, Byomedic, S. C. P., Barcelona, Spain) was used to measure "flight" time (t) during the vertical jump (accuracy 0. 001 s). Maximum height achieved by the body centre of gravity (h) was then estimated, i. e. h = g · t 2 / 8, where g = 9. 81 m/s 2. In all occasions, the participants were instructed to abstain from strenuous exercise for the preceding 24 hours. Whole-body vibration was carried out on an <b>oscillating</b> vibrating <b>platform</b> (Galileo 900, Novotec, Pforzheim, Germany). Since a suitable protocol of WBV has not been definitely established (Cormie et al., 2006), participants were randomly allocated into five groups with different vibration protocols. The proportion of males (from 30. 8 to 36. 8 %) was similar in the five groups. Vibration amplitude was fixed at ± 3 mm (i. e., peak-to-peak of 6 mm) for all groups, while frequency and duration ranged from 20 to 30 Hz and 90 or 120 s, respectively (Table 1). The time over the platform was equally distributed in three positions: 1 st) isometric squat at a knee angle of approximately 120 º, standing on the toes; 2 nd) isometric squat at a knee angle of approximately 120 º, standing on the whole foot; and 3 rd) dynamic half squats (lower limit: 90 º knee angle) at a fixed rhythm marked by a metronome (2. 4 s per squat). Sport shoes were required during the entire vibration stimulus and all CMJ tests. The interaction between sex, WBV protocol- group and CMJ performance was analysed by means of two-way repeated measures analysis of the variance (ANOVA). Since no significant interaction was found, males and females, as well as the five groups were analyzed together by repeated measured analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with sex and WBV protocol-group as covariates. All the residuals showed a satisfactory pattern. Pairwise comparisons were performed with Bonferroni adjustment. The analysis was performed using the SPSS software v 15. 0. 1., and the level of significance was set at 5 %. The CMJ performance significantly decreased immediately after WBV was applied (p < 0. 001). This decrease did not differ among the five WBV protocols used, and ranged between 1. 1 cm for the 20 Hz - 90 s group and 2. 7 cm for the 20 Hz - 120 s group. In the jumps performed one and two min after WBV, the performance was recovered up to the level achieved in the absence of WBV. Since the effect of the five different WBV protocols on CMJ performance did not significantly differ, the results are presented jointly (Figure 1). Reports concerning acute effects of WBV on jump performance yield conflicting results. Transient benefits of 2. 5, 4 and 8 % in CMJ height has been reported after 4 min (Torvinen et al., 2002 a), 10 min (Bosco et al., 2000) and 5 min (Cochrane and Stannard, 2005) of WBV stimulus, respectively. The lack of improvement in our study may be partially explained by the time elapsed between the vibration stimulus and the jump test, since our subjects performed the CMJ immediately after the WBV exposure. The different training level of the participants may also explain discrepancies among studies, as our subjects were not engaged in any regular exercise practice. It has been reported that elite athletes may obtain more benefits from WBV than amateur athletes do (Issurin and Tenenbaum, 1999). In agreement with our results, other studies did not show improvement on CMJ performance after a single bout of WBV (Cormie et al., 2006; Rittweger et al., 2003; Torvinen et al., 2002 b). Compared with our results, Cormie et al., 2006 did not find an impairment of CMJ performance immediately after a single WBV bout of 30 s, which may be associated with their shorter WBV stimulus (30 s), the interval actually elapsed between WBV and CMJ test, and the higher training level of their participants. In summary, whole-body vibration combined with voluntary contractions {{does not seem to be}} a useful method for warming up before activities involving vertical jumps. At least one minute interval recovery should be allowed when using WBV in a range of 20 - 30 Hz and 90 or 120 s if maximal jump performance is required.

40|$|Due {{to various}} {{physical}} impairments, individuals with chronic diseases often live a sedentary lifestyle, {{which leads to}} physical de-conditioning. The associated muscle weakness, functional decline and bone loss also render these individuals highly susceptible to falls and fragility fractures. There is an urgent need to search for safe and effective intervention strategies to prevent fragility fractures by modifying the fall-related risk factors and enhancing bone health. Whole body vibration (WBV) therapy has gained popularity in rehabilitation in recent years. In this type of treatment, mechanical vibration is delivered to the body while the individual is standing on an <b>oscillating</b> <b>platform.</b> As mechanical loading {{is one of the}} most powerful stimuli to induce osteogenesis, it is proposed that the mechanical stress applied to the human skeleton in WBV therapy might be beneficial for enhancing bone mass. Additionally, the vibratory signals also constitute a form of sensory stimulation and can induce reflex muscle activation, which could potentially induce therapeutic effects on muscle strength and important sensorimotor functions such as postural control. Increasing research evidence suggests that WBV is effective in enhancing hip bone mineral density, muscle strength and balance ability in elderly patients, and could have potential for individuals with chronic diseases, who often cannot tolerate vigorous impact or resistance exercise training. This article aims to discuss the potential role of WBV therapy in the prevention of fragility fractures among people with chronic diseases. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{highlight}} the relationship between muscle motion, generated by whole body vibration, and the correspondent electromyographic (EMG) activity and to suggest a new method to customize the stimulation frequency. Simultaneous recordings of EMG and tri-axial accelerations of quadriceps rectus femoris from fifteen subjects undergoing vibration treatments were collected. Vibrations were delivered via a sinusoidal <b>oscillating</b> <b>platform</b> at different frequencies (10 – 45 Hz). Muscle motion was estimated by processing the accelerometer data. Large EMG motion artifacts were removed using sharp notch filters centred at the vibration frequency and its superior harmonics. EMG–RMS values were computed and analyzed before and after artifact suppression to assess muscular activity. Muscles acceleration amplitude increased with frequency. Muscle displacements revealed a mechanical resonantlike behaviour of the muscle. Resonance frequencies and dumping factors depended on subject. Moreover, RMS of artifact-free EMG was found well correlated (R 2 = 0. 82) to the actual muscle displacement, while the maximum of the EMG response was found related to the mechanical resonance frequency of muscle. Results showed that maximum muscular activity was found in correspondence to the mechanical resonance of the muscle itself. Assuming the hypothesis that muscle activation is proportional to muscle displacement, treatment optimization (i. e. to choose the best stimulation frequency) could be obtained by simply monitoring local acceleration (resonance), leading to a more effective muscle stimulation. Motion artifact produced an overestimation of muscle activity, therefore its removal was essentia...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was firstly to {{investigate}} whether 8 weeks of whole body vibration (WBV) training was an acceptable form of exercise for patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and secondly what effect it may have on measures of functional capacity. Methods: Fifteen participants with MS volunteered for WBV training three times a week on a commercialised Galileo Sport™ vibration machine with an <b>oscillating</b> <b>platform.</b> Training consisted of two four week blocks based on an increasing stimulus training programme (overload principle). The first fours weeks involving five sets of 1 -min WBV with 1 -min rest in between with increasing vibration frequency (15 - 25 Hz, 2. 6 mm- 4. 1 mm amplitude); the second four weeks training increased to eight sets of 1 -min WBV (15 - 20 Hz, 6. 1 mm amplitude). Functional performance measures (Timed up and Go, Standing Balance, Functional Reach and Timed walk) and quality of life questionnaire (SF- 36) were conducted prior to training, at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 2 weeks (10 wk) following the completion of the training. Results: The 10 m walk test showed significant improvements at the 2 m, 8 m and 10 m measure between pre vs. 8 wk (P< 0. 05) and pre vs. 10 wk (P< 0. 05). Timed up and Go demonstrated a significant time effect (P< 0. 05). Standing balance showed significant improvements at pre and 4 week (p< 0. 05) and pre and 10 week (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: This is the first study to investigate WBV as an exercise training modality for MS patients. It was shown that not only is WBV training safe, well tolerated by MS patients but it also improved standing balance and walking speed in MS patients...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} GPS and BeiDou data to measure the movements of two oscillating platforms {{in a series of}} field experiments. Data were gathered from a variety of GNSS receivers at a rate of 10 Hz, and processed in an on the fly manner, resulting in 3 D coordinates at a 10 Hz rate with the corresponding precise time. These data were then analysed using a Power Spectral Density (PSD) function to derive the frequency of the movements. The positional data were also compared by matching a 500 epoch section of the data from the start with 190 successive 500 epoch long sections in order to demonstrate whether the movement measured was constant throughout, or whether there were any changes. The results show that the correlation of the positional data over a 30, 737 epoch period deviates between 99. 8 % to 76. 7 % correlation with RMS values of 89. 2 %, 87. 9 % and 77. 5 % in the Eastings, Northings and Vertical directions respectively when using GPS. The RMS of the Eastings and Northings remain the same when BeiDou is introduced, but the height component improves slightly to 78. 9 %. The frequency analysis of the same 500 epoch long sections is constantly measured at 0. 1172 Hz in all three positional components, illustrating less deviation when analysing the frequencies. The main conclusion is that analysis of the resulting PSD output from GNSS data gathered on an <b>oscillating</b> <b>platform</b> is more constant and precise than analysing the results of the coordinates alone. This suggests that such analysis would be well suited for a Structural Health Monitoring system. The introduction of BeiDou also improves the results slightly, even in its current incomplete constellation. The novelty of this work is the analysis of the movements in such a controlled environment, and the correlation approach of the resulting positional output as well as the frequency derivation from the positions using both GPS and BeiDou...|$|E
40|$|Whole body {{vibration}} (WBV) {{delivers a}} stimulus {{to the body}} via an <b>oscillating</b> <b>platform</b> and remains a relatively new area of research. Several applications of WBV stimuli have been developed as strength training and rehabilitation modalities, but inconsistent results have been published. There is little knowledge underpinning the mechanisms to explain the elicited neuromuscular responses to WBV and {{a wide range of}} WBV parameters across the literature. As a result, safe and effective protocols are yet to be established or validated. The aim of this current research was to investigate: the electromyography (EMG) and explosive performance responses to varying WBV frequencies; the effect of WBV data analysis techniques; and the influence of external factors on WBV stimulus and neuromuscular responses. Three main studies were completed: 1. An individualised response of both EMG and jump performance appears to exist dependent on vertical WBV frequency, in trained participants. This is in spite of no overall frequency dependent effect of EMG or performance responses across participants as a group. The influence of the role of expectancy effect appears minimal following this particular WBV protocol. 2. There was a significant effect of filter technique on EMG data recorded during vertical WBV. A tailored, WBV specific notch filter technique may offer an effective balance; excluding WBV noise artifacts without removing significant portions of valuable muscle signal EMG data. 3. The influence of external load on WBV acceleration output also appears minimal. Platform acceleration output was dependent on WBV frequency, as expected. Lower accelerations were recorded in superior body segments, suggesting a dampening mechanism, which was also proportionally dependent on frequency. EMG activity of upper and lower leg segments may differ in response to frequency, likely due to transmission distances involved. This may partially account for a potential dampening mechanism. In addition, a protocol to quantify WBV stimuli delivered by this particular WBV type illustrated significant differences in theoretical and actual parameters. This may explain not only the lack of overall explosive performance effect reported earlier; but also the inconsistent WBV literature. Future research should quantify WBV stimulus before investigating possible neuromuscular responses to individualised protocols, which may be assessed via EMG activity...|$|E
40|$|Background: Stroke {{is a type}} of {{cardiovascular}} disease, which has the third highest mortality rate in New Zealand. Risk factors of stroke have major consequences on the structure and function of blood vessels and their interaction with circulating blood; altering vascular structure through encouraging atherosclerosis and stiffening of arteries and by inducing thickening, narrowing, and tortuosity of capillaries and arterioles. Additionally, research has reported that the most significant effect of a stroke for a survivor is a decline in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Studies state that stroke is associated with increased arterial stiffness, and even once established, arterial stiffness can be diminished by a programme of physical activity. Whole-body vibration (WBV) is a safe, easy to use, and time effective exercise intervention that has demonstrated significant improvements in arterial stiffness in healthy men and older sedentary adults. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore the possibility of WBV as a valuable intervention in chronic stroke. Purpose: To investigate whether 4 weeks of WBV would significantly reduce indices of arterial stiffness, and improve cognition and quality of life in chronic stroke. Methods: Six participants with chronic stroke volunteered for this study. This was a cross-over design, where participants were exposed to WBV training for 4 weeks (3 times a week) on a commercialised Galileo vibration machine with an <b>oscillating</b> <b>platform.</b> WBV parameters were progressed throughout the 4 week intervention (5 - 7 sets of 60 sec bouts with 60 sec rest, 22 - 26 Hz, 2. 1 - 6. 5 mm, static squatting), and a 2 week washout period was prescribed between WBV and control (usual day-to-day living for four weeks) interventions. Arterial stiffness measurements (carotid arterial stiffness, PWV, PWA), cognition (ACE-III), and quality of life (SF- 36), were conducted prior to each intervention and after the completion of each intervention. Additionally, rate of perceived exertion (Borg 15 -point scale) was also recorded following every WBV session. Results: No significant improvements were shown for central BPs, HR, or central AIx@ 75. Additionally, no significant improvements were seen in PWV between WBV and control. There was not significant interaction, or main effects for carotid arterial stiffness (ß), DC or CC. However, carotid arterial stiffness did display a decrease over time for WBV, where arterial stiffness increased for control over time, but these measurements and their interaction effect were not found to be significant (p= 0. 166). No significant interaction or main effects were found for quality of life (SF- 36) or cognitive ability (ACE-III). Finally, there was no significance of RPE over the 4 weeks. Conclusions: Limited studies have investigated the effects of multiple sessions of WBV (short-term training) in stroke, with no study examining the effects of WBV on arterial stiffness, QOL or cognition. The present study found no significant improvements in indices of arterial stiffness, cognitive ability, or QOL. However, this was the first study to investigate the effects of WBV on these variables in chronic stroke; therefore further research with larger sample sizes are needed to investigate the aims of this study further...|$|E
40|$|Background Whole-body {{vibration}} (WBV) as {{a training}} modality is {{established in the}} fields of sport, fitness, rehabilitation, and clinical intervention. WBV exercises are performed thereby while standing on a motor driven <b>oscillating</b> <b>platform</b> device. Therefore, the scientific interest in WBV is a steadily increasing field in sports science and research. It has been shown that WBV training elicits various biological and physiological effects in men. Nevertheless, there are {{only a small number of}} studies examining WBV effects on neuromuscular performance of the lower extremities in elderly people. Furthermore, the results of these studies show many discrepancies that may be caused by limitations referring to the different applied training protocols and vibration loads. In addition, there is still a deficit of information for effective but safe recommendations for WBV application for trunk and neck muscles. Therefore, this doctoral thesis deals with three major aspects of WBV as an exercise modality in strength training: (1) the recommendation of optimal vibration loads (VbLs) for the lower extremities as an essential element of the WBV exercise parameters in older adults, (2) the evaluation of these VbLs in a WBV training intervention for elderly people with regard to feasibility and chronic effects on neuromuscular performance of the lower limbs, and (3) the allocation of information for effective but safe advices for VbLs for trunk and neck muscles. These aspects are further specified toward five hypotheses (H 1, H 2, H 3, H 4, and H 5) by findings and limitations of the current state of literature. Methods The five hypotheses are evaluated within three research papers (studies 1 to 3). The first study (S 1) evaluated the optimal VbL determined by the combination of three biomechanical variables (vibration frequency, vibration amplitude, and knee angle) in older adults (H 1). Therefore, the neuromuscular activity of the quadriceps femoris and hamstring muscles in 51 healthy subjects were measured during WBV exposure using surface electromyography (EMG). Maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) were conducted prior to the measurements to normalise the EMG signals. A three-way mixed ANOVA was performed to analyse the different effects of the biomechanical variables on muscle activity. Study 2 (S 2) represents a randomised controlled trial to assess the results of S 1 implemented in a WBV training protocol and therefore to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a six-week WBV intervention (H 2, H 3, and H 4). A total of 21 subjects was allocated randomly into either a WBV training or control group. While the WBV group completed a six-week WBV training programme the control group was asked not to change their current level of physical activity during the study. Before and after the intervention period, jump height was measured during a countermovement jump (CMJ). In addition, isokinetic knee extension and flexion strength parameters were recorded using a motor-driven dynamometer. The Borg scale for ratings of perceived exertion (RPE scale) was used to evaluate the intensity of WBV exercises within each training session. Changes from pre- to posttest were analysed by a paired sample t-test (within-group comparisons) and independent sample t-test (between-group comparisons). The intention of study 3 (S 3) was to analyse the impact of biomechanical variables on neuromuscular activity of different trunk and neck muscles during WBV (H 5) filling the lack of information in current literature. Those biomechanical variables were assumed, which current literature suggests as having the lowest risk of negative side effects on the head. Surface EMG was used to record the neuromuscular activity in 28 healthy subjects. EMG signals were normalised to prior measured MVC. Different effects of the biomechanical variables were analysed by an ANOVA for repeated measurements. Results The findings of S 1 showed that the biomechanical variables affect the level of neuromuscular activity of thigh muscles in older adults in different dimensions which confirms H 1. The maximum levels of muscle activity were significantly reached at high amplitude and high frequency, whereas the factor “knee angle” only significantly affected the quadriceps femoris. Furthermore, WBV led to a higher muscle activation of the quadriceps femoris (74. 1 % MVC) than of the hamstring muscles (27. 3 % MVC). The main findings in S 2 were an increased multi-joint strength performance of the lower limbs during a countermovement jump in the WBV group, whereas values of the control group remained unchanged after the intervention, thus confirming H 2. There were no statistically significant differences in isokinetic maximal strength, mean power, or work values in knee extension or flexion in both groups (rejecting H 3). In addition, the subjective perceived exertion of the WBV exercises and respective training parameters ranged between moderate rating levels of 7 and 13 of the Borg scale and indicate WBV intervention as a feasible and safe training program for elderly people, which is consistent with H 4. Finally, the outcomes of S 3 confirmed H 5 as the biomechanical variables affect the level of neuromuscular activity of the trunk and neck in different dimensions. The maximum levels of muscle activity were significantly reached at high amplitude and high frequency, while knee angles had similar effects on the VbL. WBV led to a higher muscle activation of the lower back muscles (27. 2 % MVC) than of neck muscles (8. 5 % MVC) and the abdominal muscles (3. 6 % MVC). Conclusion A maximised VbL for WBV training in older adults depends on specific combinations of the biomechanical variables (vibration frequency, vibration amplitude, and knee angle). In addition, a WBV training based on this age-specific high VbL is a feasible, suitable and effective training program for elderly people to prevent age-related reduction of muscle performance in the lower extremities. Furthermore, the combination of biomechanical variables recommended in literature as safe for preventing harmful transmissions to the head, only elicit low to moderate muscle activation of the upper body. The findings of this thesis represent fundamental research in the field of WBV and may help to improve further research in this area. Finally, this thesis may help coaches and therapists to enhance the quality of WBV training in practical application. Hintergrund Ganzkörpervibration (Whole-Body Vibration, WBV) hat sich als Trainingsanwendung im Sport-, Fitness, Rehabilitationsbereich und klinischen Bereich etabliert, wobei die Übungen dabei im Stehen auf einer Vibrationsplatte durchgeführt werden. In diesem Zusammenhang ist auch das wissenschaftliche Interesse am Vibrationstraining ein stetig wachsendes Feld in den Bereichen der Sportwissenschaft und Forschung. Bisher konnte gezeigt werden, dass Vibrationstraining verschiedene biologische als auch physiologische Reaktionen beim Menschen hervorruft. Dennoch gibt es nur wenige Untersuchungen, die sich mit den Auswirkungen des Vibrationstrainings auf die neuromuskuläre Leistung der unteren Extremitäten bei älteren Menschen beschäftigen. Des Weiteren weißen die Ergebnisse dieser wenigen Studien viele Widersprüchlichkeiten auf, welche durch die unterschiedlich verwendeten Trainingsvorgaben und Vibrationsbelastungen verursacht sein könnten. Darüber hinaus besteht noch ein großes Defizit an grundlegenden Informationen hinsichtlich effektiver, aber dennoch sicherer Vorgaben in der Anwendung des Vibrationstrainings im Bereich der Rumpf- und Nackenmuskulatur. Vor diesem Hintergrund beschäftigt sich die vorliegende Dissertation mit drei wesentlichen Aspekten des Vibrationstrainings: (1) die Empfehlung von optimalen Vibrationsbelastungen (VbL) als wesentlicher Bestandteil des Vibrationstrainingsplans der unteren Extremitäten älterer Menschen, (2) die Evaluierung dieser VbL anhand einer auf Vibrationstraining basierter Intervention mit älteren Menschen hinsichtlich Durchführbarkeit und Auswirkungen auf die neuromuskuläre Leistung der unteren Gliedmaßen, und (3) Angaben für effektive und sichere VbL für Rumpf- und Nackenmuskulatur bereitzustellen. Mit der Aufarbeitung von Ergebnissen und Defiziten des aktuellen Forschungsstands werden diese Aspekte durch die Formulierung von fünf Hypothesen (H 1, H 2, H 3, H 4, and H 5) weiter spezifiziert. Methodik Die fünf Hypothesen werden in drei wissenschaftlichen Veröffentlichungen (Studie 1 bis 3) untersucht. Die erste Studie (S 1) befasste sich mit der optimalen VbL für ältere Personen (H 1), welche durch die Kombination von drei biomechanischen Variablen (Vibrationsfrequenz, Vibrationsamplitude und Kniewinkel) bestimmt wird. Hierzu wurde die neuromuskuläre Aktivität der vorderen und hinteren Oberschenkelmuskulatur von 51 gesunden Probanden unter Vibration mittels Oberflächen-Elektromyografie (EMG) gemessen. Vor den Messungen wurden maximale muskuläre Kontraktionen durchgeführt, um die EMG zu normalisieren. Um die unterschiedlichen Auswirkungen der biomechanischen Variablen zu analysieren wurde eine drei-faktorielle Varianzanalyse durchgeführt. Studie 2 (S 2) entspricht einer randomisierten kontrollierten Studie, welche die Ergebnisse aus S 1 in einem Trainingsplan verwendet, um die Durchführbarkeit und Effektivität eines sechs wöchigen Vibrationstrainings zu untersuchen (H 2, H 3, und H 4). Hierfür wurden 21 Probanden zufällig einer Vibrationstrainings- oder einer Kontrollgruppe zugeteilt. Während die Vibrationsgruppe ein sechs wöchiges Vibrationstraining absolvierte, wurden die Teilnehmer der Kontrollgruppe gebeten ihre körperliche Aktivität während des Studienzeitraums nicht zu verändern. Vor und nach dem Untersuchungszeitraums wurde die Sprunghöhe während eines „countermovement jump“ (CMJ) erfasst. Weiterhin wurden isokinetische Kraftmessgrößen der Kniegelenkbeugung und –streckung an einem Dynamometer ermittelt. Die Borgskala zur Erfassung des subjektiven Belastungsempfindens wurde eingesetzt, um die Intensität der Übungen des Vibrationstrainings innerhalb einer Trainingseinheit zu messen. Veränderungen der Messgrößen zwischen Eingangs- und Abschlusstest wurden statistisch mit einem t-Test für abhängige (innerhalb einer Gruppe) und einem t-Test für unabhängige Stichproben (zwischen den Gruppen) untersucht. Ziel der dritten Studie (S 3) war es den Einfluss der biomechanischen Variablen auf die muskuläre Aktivierung verschiedener Rumpf- und Nackenmuskeln (H 5). Hierzu wurden solche biomechanische Variablen ausgesucht, welche laut derzeitigem Wissensstand jeweils das geringste Risiko von Nebenwirkungen für den Kopf ausüben. Mittels Oberflächen-EMG wurde die muskuläre Aktivität von 28 Probanden erfasst. EMG Signale wurden zu vorangegangenen MVC Messungen normalisiert. Die Unterschiedlichen Effekte der biomechanischen Variablen wurden mittels einer Varianzanalyse für Messwiederholungen analysiert. Ergebnisse Die Ergebnisse von S 1 konnten zeigen, dass die biomechanischen Variablen den neuromuskulären Aktivierungsgrad der Oberschenkelmuskulatur bei älteren Personen unterschiedlich beeinflussen und somit H 1 bestätigen. Der höchste Grad der Aktivierung wurde deutlich mit einer großen Amplitude und hohen Frequenz erreicht, wobei der Kniewinkel ausschließlich die vordere Oberschenkelmuskulatur beeinflusst. Zudem, führte der Vibrationseinfluss zu einer größeren Muskelaktivität der Oberschenkelvorderseite (74. 1 % MVC) als der –rückseite (27. 3 % MVC). Die Resultate von S 2 hinsichtlich des CMJ Tests bestätigen H 2, da es in der Vibrationstrainingsgruppe zu einer gesteigerten gelenksübergreifender Kraftleistung in den Beinen kam, aber keine Veränderungen in der Kontrollgruppe feststellbar waren. Hingegen kam es in keiner Gruppe zu statistisch signifikanten Veränderungen der isokinetischen Messgrößen (Maximalkraft, Kraftleistung, Muskelarbeit), wodurch H 3 abgelehnt wird. Das subjektive Belastungsempfinden der Übungen und des Belastungsgefüges des Vibrationstrainings liegt zwischen moderaten Bewertungsstufen von 7 bis 13 der Borgskala und weist daraufhin, dass Vibrationstraining ein praktikables und sicheres Übungsprogramm für ältere Menschen ist und somit H 4 bestätigt. Die Ergebnisse von S 3 konnten H 5 bestätigen, da die biomechanischen Variablen den neuromuskulären Rumpf- und Nackenmuskulatur unterschiedlich beeinflussen. Der höchste Grad der Aktivierung wurde deutlich mit einer großen Amplitude und hohen Frequenz erreicht, wobei der Kniewinkel sich ähnlich auf die VbL auswirkt. Der Vibrationsstimulus führte zudem zu einer höheren Aktivierung der unteren Rückenmuskulatur (27. 2 % MVC) als der Nacken- (8. 5 % MVC) und Bauchmuskulatur (3. 6 % MVC). Schlussfolgerungen Die maximale muskuläre Belastung älterer Personen in einem Vibrationstrainings hängt von bestimmten Kombinationen der biomechanischen Variablen (Vibrationsfrequenz, Vibrationsamplitude und Kniewinkel). Zudem ist ein Vibrationstraining, das auf altersspezifischen Vibrationsbelastungen basiert ein machbares, angemessenes und effektives Trainingsprogramm für älteren Menschen, um einem altersbedingten Abnehmen der muskulären Leistungsfähigkeit vorzubeugen. Weiterhin führt die Verbindung von biomechanischen Variablen, welche laut bisherigem Forschungsstand als sicher gegen schädliche Vibrationsübertragungen zum Kopf gelten, nur zu leichten bis moderaten Muskelaktivierung im Oberkörper. Die Ergebnisse dieser Dissertation liefern einen Beitrag zur Grundlagenforschung auf dem Gebiet des Vibrationstrainings und können weiteren Forschungsarbeiten hilfreich sein. Darüber hinaus kann diese Arbeit helfen die Qualität von Vibrationstrainingsangeboten zu verbessern und somit zum praktischen Nutzen beitragen...|$|E
