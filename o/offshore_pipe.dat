Finite element {{analysis was used}} to study three conditions of pipe riser – uncorroded, corroded and corroded and repaired with designated laminate orientation of carbon/epoxy or E-glass/epoxy fibre-reinforced composite. The behaviour of the pipe riser (grade API 5 L X 60 steel) was studied using Ramberg–Osgood model. Two composites laminate systems, a pre-cured prepreg (grade AS 4 3501 - 6 carbon/epoxy) and a wet-layup filament-wounded composite (grade Gevetex LY 556 /HT 917 /DY 063 E-glass/epoxy), were characterised. Design conditions were determined via a limit analysis known as the double-elastic slope method. The results showed that under combined hoop, tensile and bending loads, the riser tends to approach failure at a much lower strain compared with each of these loads being applied individually. The limiting design factor of the composite repair system was due to excessive tensile strain experienced in a bent riser while the compressive stress caused by reversing the bending load occurred well within the linear-elastic region. With respect to the types of composite repair system, carbon fibre displayed a much better strength rehabilita-tion over glass fibre. In the aspect of laminate orientation, off-axis plies [90 / 30]s and [90 / 45 / 0]s laminates were found capable of restoring the strength of the corroded riser and provide superior reinforcement in both hoop and axial directions...|$|E

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) offers both {{economic}} and technical advantages over conventional fusion welding practices for welding line-pipe. For offshore line-pipe construction, the economic savings {{has been shown to}} be considerable, approaching a calculated 25 %. <b>Offshore</b> <b>pipe</b> is relatively small diameter but heavy wall compared to onshore pipe. One concern is the ability to achieve consistent full weld penetration in an on-site offshore FSW operation, e. g., on a lay-barge. Further, depending on the size and morphology of the unwelded zone, lack of penetration at the weld root can be difficult if not impossible to detect by conventional NDE methods. Thus, an approach to assure consistent full penetration via process control is required for offshore line-pipe construction using FSW. For offshore construction, an internal structural mandrel can be used offering the opportunity to use a sacrificial anvil FSW approach. With this approach, a small volume of sacrificial material can be inserted into the structural anvil. The FSW tool penetrates into the sacrificial anvil, beyond the inner diameter of the pipe wall, thus assuring full penetration. The sacrificial material is subsequently removed from the pipe inner wall. In the work presented herein, FSW studies were completed on both 6 mm and 12 mm wall thickness line-pipe. Post-FSW evaluations including radiography, root-bend tests, and metallography demonstrated the merits of the sacrificial anvil approach to achieve consistent full penetration...|$|E
40|$|Sand erosion is {{the cause}} of {{widespread}} structural damage in <b>offshore</b> <b>pipe</b> systems and it is often associated with large costs. Correlative and empirical methods are often used to predict erosion rates. Such procedures, however, tend to yield overly conservative estimates. In this thesis, a Lagrangian CFD model has been compared with some of the main correlative methods for predicting erosion in gas streams for pipe bends and blinded tees. It is found that the correlative methods differ by several orders of magnitude. The DNV RP O 501 correlation under-predicts erosion by more than one order of magnitude for low density fluid mixtures at velocities below 10 m/s. Maximum erosion rates are obtained at intermediate sand particle diameters both for the pipe bend and blinded tee. Furthermore, an Eulerian model for high particle loadings, derived for use in fluidized-bed combustors, has been adapted to predict erosion on steel grades. The model reproduces similar erosion patterns, as well as velocity and particle diameter dependencies, as correlative methods suggest. The magnitude of erosion has not been reproduced, presumably due to an erroneous proportionality constant. Eulerian methods are associated with inherent losses of vital information, such as the particle impingement angle and impact phenomena. We believe that the outlook is generally poor for accurate wear predictions in the Eulerian framework and capturing of effects such as lowered erosion efficiency in dense mixtures...|$|E

40|$|Reinforced {{thermoplastic}} pipes (RTPs) {{are considered}} as prospective alternatives to traditional steel <b>pipes</b> in various <b>offshore</b> {{oil and gas}} applications due to their attractive properties such as better corrosion resistance, high stiffness and strength to weight ratios and low maintenance costs. In this work, studies of the mechanical behaviour of RTPs composed of pipe grade polyethylene (PE) and aramid fibres, and subjected to various loads are conducted using Finite Elements Analysis (FEA). The RTP is modelled using shell elements available in Abaqus/Standard with both geometric and material nonlinearities considered. In order to model the material nonlinearity, equations describing the nonlinear stress-strain relationship of PE are adopted in the material models which reflect strain-dependent mechanical characteristics of PE and fibre-reinforced PE composites during loading. Based on these models, numerical algorithms have been developed using the FORTRAN programming language and implemented through user-defined subroutines, UMATs. The developed modelling approach has been verified by comparisons with experimental and computational results reported in the literature. The pressure capacity of an RTP is investigated {{as it is a}} primary concern in designing <b>offshore</b> <b>pipes.</b> It was found that the nonlinear mechanical behaviour of PE enables the RTP to avoid premature material failures in the PE matrix, liner and cover. Since the spoolability of RTPs is essential in their installation process, their flexural behaviour is also analysed. The analysis showed that the estimation of the minimum allowable bend radius of the RTP can be improved by using the proposed modelling approach. It was found that the sufficient spoolability of RTPs can be also achieved by employing certain one and two angle-ply reinforcing layer systems, and the reel diameter could decreased by 24. 29 %. This will result in significant reduction in the transportation and material costs during the installation phase of the pipeline. Several combined loading cases are considered. For each load combination, parametric studies have been conducted. The failure modes are found to be dependent on loading paths and types of loads applied. Based on the computational results obtained, design guidelines and recommendations {{that could be used in}} practical design of RTPs for offshore applications are formulated...|$|R

40|$|Allseas Engineering bv is an {{engineering}} {{center of the}} Allseas group, {{a major player in}} the <b>offshore</b> <b>pipe</b> lay market and recently expanding the activities to the offshore heavy lift sector. Because of the necessity to design and build lifting structures and equipment of a tremendously high capacity, the demand for high-strength steels usage has been arisen. These steels are to be welded and used in a harsh offshore environment. Localized heating and melting of a workpiece during welding lead to the build-up of residual stresses. When distortion is prevented due to constraints in structures or due to clamping, stress levels will be high and may exceed the yield strength. Post weld treatments are often carried out to mitigate or re-distribute the residual stresses. Ultrasonic impact techniques make use of the combined effects of the high frequency impacts and ultrasonic oscillations in the treated material. Ultrasonic impact treatment (UIT) has been applied successfully to increase the fatigue life of parts and welded elements, to eliminate distortion caused by welding and other technological processes, to relieve residual stresses, and to increase the hardness of materials. Although reported results on fatigue life are very promising, the detailed changes induced in the treated material and the mechanisms by which such changes occur are still poorly understood. In this research, the main objectives are to understand the stress build-up during multi-pass welding, and the mechanisms involved in post weld ultrasonic impact treatments, how these affect the residual stress state in the welded area.

40|$|Offshore {{pipelines}} {{are increasingly}} being required to operate at high temperature and pressure as more petroleum deposits are explored further away from the shore. These extra-long pipelines are usually placed in deep sea; normally trenching to bury them becomes impractical, and therefore they are placed directly on the seabed, embedding partially only by the self-weight. As the length of pipeline increases along with the operating temperature, the likelihood for the pipeline to expand during heating cycles increases. Therefore, during heating and cooling cycles, the pipeline can experience continued expansion or the behaviour known as “pipeline walking” amounting to metres of expansion. The pipe-soil interaction behaviour could be classified into three dimensions, corresponding to axial, vertical and lateral directions. Commonly, {{all three of these}} interaction behaviours are studied in isolation, and the understanding developed combined to predict the overall response of the pipe under combined loadings. In recent years, some efforts are also reported to characterise the combined behaviour of the pipe in two or more directions. In particular, extensive research is undertaken to investigate both the vertical and lateral pipe displacement behaviours. However, the pipe axial interaction phenomenon, which is considered as the prime reason for pipe instability, is yet to be clearly established either in isolation or in combination with the interaction behaviours in the other two directions. Another unique characteristic to <b>offshore</b> <b>pipe</b> embedment is the low effective stresses at the interface. In submerged condition, significant buoyant effect (Bruton et al. 2005) would act on the sealed pipe walls and reduces the effective stresses on the soft seabed soil. As a common practice these petroleum pipes are provided with thick concrete coatings which serve as corrosion barriers. Although such coatings make the pipe heavier, the thickness of the pipe (nearly twice the diameter) counteracts the weight by enhancing buoyancy. Therefore, in deep seabed conditions, the pipe interaction occurs at very low effective contact stresses on soil, thereby providing very low interface shear strengths. As these conditions are not very common to geotechnical applications (e. g., strip footings), the soil behaviour at such low effective stresses has rarely been investigated. Funded by the CSIRO Cluster Pipe Project, the main research objectives of the current study are to interpret the axial interaction behaviour of offshore pipelines to be laid on the seabeds of the North Western Shelf of Australia. A special sophisticated 2 D actuator setup (Monash Advanced Pipe System or MAPS) was purpose built to simulate the pipe walking on a model clay seabed. Element pipe testing was conducted for both drained and undrained pipe displacement rates The results led to the characterisation of the governing parameters on the axial pipe-soil interaction behaviour. The problem was also studied by means of extensive numerical studies. The models provided the means to study the soil behaviour that cannot normally be measured by real time experiments...|$|E
40|$|To support cost {{calculations}} for tendering a pipe lay project, {{the influence}} of weather conditions has to be incorporated by applying workability predictions for the pipe lay vessel. When assuming constant good weather conditions {{it is possible to}} accurately determine the duration of an <b>offshore</b> <b>pipe</b> lay project. In practice however, changing weather influences have to be incorporated to determine the actual total project duration. The objective {{of this study is to}} find a new calculation method that is more accurate and has a short calculation time. First the existing method to predict the workability during pipe laying has been analysed and shortcomings have been identified. Historical project data for the dynamically positioned pipe lay vessel Solitaire has been used. Four areas for improvements of the existing method have been identified: - Wave Prediction: Extra deviation factor - Criterion Limits: Incorporation wave period - Wave Heading: Chosen on solid base - Abandonment and Recovery (A&R) : Dependent on project location The first aspect of interest is the wave prediction. Currently used wave measurements are satellite data combined with buoy measurements. A scatter diagram represents the occurring sea states for a certain location, as combinations of the significant wave height related to the zero crossing period. This is at the moment the best available representation used for wave predictions. In this study a program has been written to determine the standard deviation of the workability prediction caused by variation in the weather conditions. As input for the composed program the limiting sea states for the vessel, project duration and scatter diagram are used. Logically, the project duration has a direct relation to the deviation. Five criteria, (i) pipe strain, (ii) stinger tip clearance, (iii) stinger forces, (iv) tensioner dynamics and (v) dynamic positioning (DP) system limit the sea states for the workability. The vertical stinger tip motion is a good parameter to determine the workability for the criteria concerning the pipeline (i to iv). When the critical value for one of the criteria is reached, the accompanying vessel motion is determined. The vessel motions are known for the whole scatter diagram and compared with the critical motion to determine the workable limit. For the criterion (v) DP system, which can compensate displacements in the horizontal plane, the same program as for the existing method will be used. For the other criteria the new method incorporates {{the influence of}} the wave period, while for the existing method only the wave height is regarded. The third area is the wave heading. As mentioned before, the vertical stinger tip motion is a good parameter to give an indication of the influence of waves. For different wave angles the stinger tip motion is plotted. Two angles are chosen as representative values for the whole compass rose. The existing method treats the average and worst wave angle for the vessel. By using the new method more accurate results can be achieved based on solid assumptions. A&R is the lay down process of the pipeline because of bad weather conditions. Currently a fixed percentage of the production time is used to predict the duration of A&R. Not only the duration of bad weather but also the number of times a critical sea state is exceeded determines the duration for A&R. By using old project data a relation between the duration for A&R and the workability percentage has been found. For North Sea projects a relation with the probability of exceedence of the significant wave height is found. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the special}} {{structure}} of <b>offshore</b> multiphase <b>pipes,</b> {{it is easy for}} severe slugging to occur in the riser at low gas-liquid velocity. Violent pressure fluctuations and dramatic changes of flow rate are the main characteristics of severe slugging, leading to the risk of serious damage. In this paper, the separator control is adopted to accurately control the separator liquid level and pressure under severe slugging flow conditions. This indicates that the separator liquid level control alone does not {{have a significant impact on}} the upstream flow, but it is beneficial for normal operation and pressure control of the separator. As the separator pressure increases, the peak pressure in the riser apparently diminishes, and the amplitude of pressure fluctuation gradually decreases, which means that severe slugging is inhibited. During the slug blowing out, the gas/liquid slipping in the riser intensifies. The long gas plug quickly flows through the riser, and then tends to morph into short and slowly flowing gas bubbles. The elimination effect of the pressure control strategy on severe slugging is related to the relative rate of the superficial gas/liquid flow.|$|R

In {{order to make a}} safe design, knowledge is required of the soil deformation under an ice keel scouring the soil. Since it is difficult to examine ice scouring in a field test, tests have been carried out in the geotechnical centrifuge of the University of Delft. Several parameters were varied, such as speed, undrained shear strength, scour depth and multiple scouring. A grid was placed on the clay sample so that the complex deformation pattern could be visualized clearly. The soil deformation was measured by means of image processing and the horizontal and vertical loads were measured. The tests have shown interesting relationships between these parameters and the subgouge deformation. Under some circumstances, shear bands and deep cracks could be observed. The test results indicate that the depth of subgouge deformation can be estimated by the undrained shear strength of the soil. ...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion is a {{key issue}} for {{operators}} in {{the oil and gas}} industry since production fluids contain some water and both CO 2 and H 2 S acid gases. In this context, this paper illustrates the development of a reactive barrier polymer against corrosion by H 2 S of <b>offshore</b> flexible <b>pipes.</b> The role of this reactive material, called anti-H 2 S material, is to avoid H 2 S reaching the structural steel layers of the flexible pipe during the whole service life of the structure, usually 20  years, and hence to place the steel layers in a sweet service environment. Placed between the existing pressure sheath and the steel layers, the anti-H 2 S material has the ability to neutralize H 2 S during its diffusion within the material. The neutralization is ensured by an irreversible chemical reaction on reactive components that are dispersed in the material. The raw material selection is based on both accurate requirements for their use in a flexible pipe and expected performances in a sour service environment over a long period of time. Some laboratory qualifications and experimental techniques are used to qualify the behavior of the material and build the material database. A dedicated multiphysics model is developed based on the coupling of permeation mechanisms and gas-solid reactions. Qualification of both the material and the model is performed thanks to middle-scale and full-scale tests conducted in representative sour service conditions...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} focus on the environmental impact and energy consumption of {{the oil and gas}} industry. In offshore drilling equipment, electric motors tend to replace traditionally used hydraulic motors, especially in rotational motion control applications. However, force densities available from linear hydraulic actuators are still typically higher than those of electric actuators. Therefore, usually the remaining source of hydraulic power is thereby the hydraulic cylinder. This paper presents a feasibility study on the implementation of an electromechanical cylinder drivetrain on an <b>offshore</b> vertical <b>pipe</b> handling machine. The scope {{of this paper is to}} investigate the feasibility of a commercial off-the-shelf drivetrain. With a focus on the motion performance, numerical modeling and simulation are used when sizing and selecting the components of the considered electromechanical cylinder drivetrain. The simulation results are analyzed and discussed together with a literature study regarding advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solution considering the design criteria of offshore drilling equipment. It is concluded that the selected drivetrain can only satisfy the static motion requirements since the required transmitted power is higher than the recommended permissible power of the transmission screw. Consequently, based on the recommendation of the manufacturer, avoidance of overheating cannot be guaranteed for the drivetrain combinations considered for the case study presented in this paper. Hence, to avoid overheating, the average speed of the motion cycle must be decreased. Alternatively, external cooling or temperature monitoring and control system that prevents overheating could be implemented...|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{pipelines}} {{are frequently}} subjected to accidental impact loads, e. g. from anchors or trawl gear. A lot of parameters - including the pipe geometry, material properties, pipeline content, impact velocity, etc. - influence {{the course of}} such an impact. Some of these parameters have been studied quite extensively while others not so much. This study presents material and component tests on specimens taken from an X 65 <b>offshore</b> pipeline. Empty <b>pipes,</b> as well as open and closed water-filled pipes, are impacted at different velocities. Results in terms of force-displacement curves are quite similar for the empty and open water-filled pipes, while the closed water-filled pipes react differently {{as a consequence of}} internal pressure build-up during impact. Computer simulations of the component tests are carried out using various numerical techniques for fluid discretisation and for fluid-structure interaction. Numerical results are generally in good agreement with experimental observations and serve as a helpful aid when interpreting results. JRC. G. 4 -European laboratory for structural assessmen...|$|R
40|$|Within <b>offshore</b> installations, making <b>pipe</b> {{couplings}} {{to conduct}} electricity is a developing interest. Being {{able to use}} tubing structures to carry the drive electric power, that is necessary downhole, helps to avoid installation of cables and lines. The challenge {{is to be able}} to make the connection good enough so that the necessary power is transferred to the connected piping dowhole with minimum possible loss. At the same time, the connection has to secure the transfer of the voltage at the output side of the piping without any danger of overheating the connection. An overheating can eventually result in a welded connection between the mating piping. As the capability of the connection to transfer power through the piping is based on the size of the contact area, the material type, the surface topography and most importantly, the connection strength, contact resistance is a limiting design factor in electrical contact design. This paper presents the result of a study performed on the electrical contact resistance of pipe couplings intended for offshore installations. The objective of the study is to investigate the influence of contact pressure (level of press fit) and contact area on the contact resistance...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{flexible}} risers {{are a common}} term for cables, umbilicals and flexible pipes,that are freely or semi-freely suspended between two points (<b>offshore).</b> Flexible <b>pipes</b> are mostly used to transport fluids between platforms/ships etc. to a flow-line/sea floor installation or similar. The safe operating window for the installation is limited by whether induced motion of the installation vessel giving rise to dynamic tension and curvature at the touch-down-zone (TDZ). By investigation and establishing of calculative methods to determine the actual limits of installation and operation, this paper wishes to further the knowledge of global torsion instability of flexible dynamical pipes in catenary configuration at the Touch-down-point (TDP). Today's methods are conservative and {{an expansion of the}} operating/installation widow will have direct economical benefits for the industry. As the filed of global torsion instability in {{flexible risers}} have already been touched upon before, this work centres around furthering this knowledge with special wight on larger cross-section diameter as found in flexible pipes. Trough analysis have been made following already established methodologies, as well as a new method made in order to linking local effects and failure modes, to global torsion problems. The results show that not all prediction methods established for offshore cables are suitable for pipes. In addition, it is seen that the most critical waves are not always the larger ones {{when it comes to the}} coupling between dynamic heave motion and torsion instability. Lastly it is found from the analysis, that dynamic flexible pipes may very well resist global torsion buckling, even when there is compression at the TDP. On top of this, dynamic flexible pipes are also very good at resisting global torsion failure, while under the influence of other failures, such as flooding of the annulus and local lateral buckling of the tensile armour. The final conclusion is that the presented opinion in newer studies on torsion instability, about the practises of today being to conservative, has been further strengthened and the limits are much larger than first anticipated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} a {{large number}} of large km-scale fluid escape pipes with complex seismic expression and a diatreme-like geometry from the mapping of a 3 D seismic survey, <b>offshore</b> Namibia. These <b>pipes</b> are crudely cylindrical, but occasionally have steep conical geometry either narrowing upwards or downwards. They are generally ovoid in planform and their ellipticity varies with pipe height. Vertical dimensions range from ca. 100 to > 1000 m and diameters range between 50 and 600 m. The lower part of the typical pipe is characterised by a sag-like or collapse type of structure, but this is only imaged well in the wider pipes. The upper part of the typical pipe is characterised by gently concave upwards reflections, with a negative relief of tens of metres. There is some evidence (pipe cross-section geometrical variations and amplitude anomalies) that these concave upwards reflections are vertically stacked palaeo-pockmarks. A conceptual model for pipe formation is proposed that involves hydraulic fracturing and localisation of focused vertical fluid escape with volume loss {{at the base of the}} pipe inducing collapse within the pipe. Continuing episodic fluid migration through the pipe produces further collapsing of the core of the pipe and pockmark structures at the top of the pipe. Longer term seepage through pipes is manifested in zones of amplification of reflections above the top of the pipe. © 2010 The Authors.

40|$|The Guided Wave UT {{method has}} been subject of several papers {{presented}} and discussed on NDT seminars and conferences worldwide due the method’s potential to solve some technological challenges regarding inspection of pipes such as buried <b>pipes,</b> insulated <b>pipes,</b> <b>offshore</b> risers and road crossings. These sections of pipelines {{are very difficult}} to inspect using other conventional NDT methods because of limited or no access. A first trial was carried out in Brazil in 2003 and planned to use the two main guided waves systems available on the market at that time to test coated, buried pipelines and insulated pipes. The results obtained in this occasion were not satisfactory for Petrobras targets. In the meantime the guided waves technology has been improved with new developments both on software and hardware and several companies worldwide have increased the use of this technology. Based on the information published claiming good performance of the technology in several applications Petrobras decided to proceed with a second trial divided in two stages: the first one carried out in November of 2005 consisting in an inspection of three rigid risers located on an offshore platform in Brazilian Northeast cost and the second one carried out in August of 2007 on an 8 ”gas pipeline onshore. The results achieved in the above mentioned second trial were extremely positive. Based on these results this paper will discuss the future of guided waves in the oil and gas industry...|$|R
