40|$|The {{fragmentation}} <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> in molecular clouds {{has attracted}} {{a lot of attention}} as {{there seems to be a}} relation between the evolution <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> and star formation. The study of the fragmentation process has been motivated by simple analytical models. However, only a few comprehensive studies have analysed the evolution <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> using numerical simulations where the filaments form self-consistently as part of molecular clouds. We address the early evolution <b>of</b> pc-scale <b>filaments</b> that form within individual clouds. We focus on three questions: How do the line masses <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> evolve? How and when do the filaments fragment? How does the fragmentation relate to the line masses <b>of</b> the <b>filaments?</b> We examine three simulated molecular clouds formed in kpc-scale numerical simulations performed with the FLASH code. We compare the properties <b>of</b> the identified <b>filaments</b> with the predictions <b>of</b> analytic <b>filament</b> stability models. The line masses and mass fraction enclosed in the identified filaments increase continuously after the onset of self-gravity. The first fragments appear early when the line masses lie well below the critical line mass of Ostriker's hydrostatic equilibrium solution. The average line masses <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> identified in 3 D density cubes increases far more quickly than those identified in 2 D column density maps. Our results suggest that hydrostatic or dynamic compression from the surrounding cloud has a significant impact on the early dynamical evolution <b>of</b> <b>filaments.</b> A simple model of an isolated, isothermal cylinder may not provide a good approach for fragmentation analysis. Caution must be exercised in interpreting distributions <b>of</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> identified in column density maps, especially in the case <b>of</b> low-mass <b>filaments.</b> Comparing or combining results from studies that use different filament finding techniques is strongly discouraged.

40|$|We measured, by {{fluorescence}} correlation spectroscopy, {{the motion}} <b>of</b> actin <b>filaments</b> in solution during hydrolysis of ATP by acto-heavy meromyosin (acto-HMM). The method {{relies on the}} fact that the intensity of fluorescence fluctuates as fluorescently labeled actin filaments enter and leave a small sample volume. The rapidity of these number fluctuations is characterized by the autocorrelation function, which decays to 0 in time that is related to the average velocity <b>of</b> translation <b>of</b> <b>filaments.</b> The time <b>of</b> decay of the autocorrelation function <b>of</b> bare actin <b>filaments</b> in solution was 10. 59 +/- 0. 85 s. Strongly bound (rigor) heads slowed down the diffusion. Direct observation <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> under an optical microscope showed that addition of HMM did not change the average length or flexibility <b>of</b> actin <b>filaments,</b> suggesting that the decrease in diffusion was not due to a HMM-induced change in the shape <b>of</b> <b>filaments.</b> Rather, slowing down of translational motion was caused by an increase in the volume of the diffusing complex. Surprisingly, the addition of ATP to acto-HMM accelerated the motion <b>of</b> actin <b>filaments.</b> The acceleration was the greatest at the low molar ratios of HMM:actin. Direct observation <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> under an optical microscope showed that in the presence of ATP the average length <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> did not change and that the filaments became stiffer, suggesting that acceleration of diffusion was not due to an ATP-induced increase in flexibility <b>of</b> <b>filaments.</b> These results show that some of the energy of splitting of ATP is impaired to actin filaments and suggest that 0. 06 +/- 0. 02 of HMM interferes with the diffusion <b>of</b> actin <b>filaments</b> during hydrolysis <b>of</b> ATP...|$|R

40|$|Context. The {{onset of}} star {{formation}} is intimately linked {{with the presence of}} massive unstable filamentary structures. These filaments are therefore key for theoretical models that aim to reproduce the observed characteristics of the star formation process in the Galaxy. Aims. As part <b>of</b> the <b>filament</b> study carried out by the Herschel Galactic Cold Cores Key Programme, here we study and discuss the filament properties presented in GCC VII (Paper I) in context with theoretical models <b>of</b> <b>filament</b> formation and evolution. Methods. A conservatively selected sample <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> located at a distance D< 500 [*]pc was extracted from the GCC fields with the getfilaments algorithm. The physical structure <b>of</b> the <b>filaments</b> was quantified according to two main components: the central (Gaussian) region <b>of</b> the <b>filament</b> (core component), and the power-law-like region dominating the filament column density profile at larger radii (wing component). The properties and behaviour of these components relative to the total linear mass density <b>of</b> the <b>filament</b> and the column density of its environment were compared with the predictions from theoretical models describing the evolution <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> under gravity-dominated conditions. Results. The feasibility of a transition from a subcritical to supercritical state by accretion at any given time is dependent on the combined effect <b>of</b> <b>filament</b> intrinsic properties and environmental conditions. Reasonably self-gravitating (high_(Mline,core)) filaments in dense environments (AV≳ 3 [*]mag) can become supercritical on timescales of t 1 [*]Myr by accreting mass at constant or decreasing width. The trend of increasing M_(line,tot) (M_(line,core) and M_(line,wing)) and ridge AV with background for the filament population also indicates that the precursors <b>of</b> star-forming <b>filaments</b> evolve coevally with their environment. The simultaneous increase <b>of</b> environment and <b>filament</b> AV explains the observed association between dense environments and high M_(line,core) values, and it argues against filaments remaining in constant single-pressure equilibrium states. The simultaneous growth <b>of</b> <b>filament</b> and background in locations with efficient mass assembly, predicted in numerical models <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> in collapsing clouds, presents a suitable scenario for the fulfillment <b>of</b> the combined <b>filament</b> mass−environment criterium that is in quantitative agreement with Herschel observations...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the role played by anisotropic diffusion in (i) the number <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> and epicardial phase singularities that sustain ventricular fibrillation in the heart, (ii) the lifetimes <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> and phase singularities, and (iii) the creation and annihilation dynamics <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> and phase singularities. A simplified monodomain model of cardiac tissue was used, with membrane excitation described by a simplified 3 -variable model. The model was configured so that a single re-entrant wave was unstable, and fragmented into multiple re-entrant waves. Re-entry was then initiated in tissue slabs with varying anisotropy ratio. The main findings of this computational study are: (i) anisotropy ratio influenced the number <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> Sustaining simulated ventricular fibrillation, with more filaments present in simulations with smaller values of transverse diffusion coefficient, (ii) each re-entrant filament was associated with around 0. 9 phase singularities on the surface of the slab geometry, (iii) phase singularities were longer lived than filaments, and (iv) the creation and annihilation <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> and phase singularities were linear functions of the number <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> and phase singularities, and these relationships were independent of the anisotropy ratio.

40|$|Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) is {{a severe}} cardiac arrhythmia. Early {{experiments}} provided {{evidence that the}} mechanism of VF is consistent with re-entry. In 3 D the sources of re-entrant waves are lines of phase singularity called ‘filaments’. Filament interactions and filament numbers {{can be used to}} quantify the complexity of activation patterns in simulated VF. The aim of this thesis is to study the effect of tissue structure, shape, initial conditions, and region <b>of</b> scar on <b>filament</b> dynamics using computational modelling. Transmural heterogeneity in 3 D slab tissue representing the ventricular wall did not show important difference in the number <b>of</b> <b>filaments.</b> Configuration <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> were influenced by transmural heterogeneity. With transmural heterogeneity, clustering <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> were observed near slow conducting border resulting in increase <b>of</b> <b>filament</b> life time. To study the effect on the shape of the tissue on filaments, filament dynamics in 3 D slab tissue was compared with filament dynamics in an idealized human left ventricle (LV) with similar apex base dimension and wall thickness. The volume of idealized LV is about twice the volume of 3 D slab. Results showed idealized LV had twice the number <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> compared to slab geometry especially with steeper restitution dynamics. This thesis highlights non-linear behaviour of activation patterns during VF in 3 D where small changes had a large influence on the number <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> in both 3 D slab and idealized LV especially with steeper restitution dynamics. Pre-existing scar tissue in VF patients can act as a source of anatomical re-entry and pin re-entrant filaments to the scar boundary. However, the interaction of scar with complex activation during VF is not well understood. This thesis investigated how simulated scars (circumferential, transmural and sub-endo transmural) with varying size and with either regular or with irregular scar boundary, influenced re-entrant filaments in simplified computational models of 3 D slab and idealized LV. Circumferential scar did not show any influence on filament dynamics and clustering <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> to scar boundary. Increased radius of transmural and sub-endocardial transmural scar had more clustering <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> to the scar boundary especially with steeper restitution dynamics. Sub- endocardial transmural scar with increased radius had more clustering <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> compared to transmural scar. Region of scar with irregular boundary had more clustering compared to scar with regular boundary. Generally transmural scar and sub-endocardial transmural scar with regular or irregular boundary did not increase the number <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> much but increased the length and lifetime <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> due to clustering <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> to the scar boundary. Since filaments pin to the boundary of the scar region, {{it can be hard to}} remove them using defibrillation techniques. It might be necessary to measure the radius and the depth of pre-existing scar tissue accurately in VF patients, as the bigger scar is likely to have more complex activation in VF. In this way it might be easier to predict the strength of defibrillation to use, in order to stop VF...|$|R

40|$|The {{leading edge}} of motile cells is {{propelled}} by polymerization <b>of</b> actin <b>filaments</b> according to a dendritic nucleation/array treadmilling mechanism. However, {{little attention has been}} given to the origin and maintenance of the dendritic array. Here we develop and test a population–kinetics model that explains the organization <b>of</b> actin <b>filaments</b> in terms <b>of</b> the reproduction of dendritic units. The life cycle <b>of</b> an actin <b>filament</b> consists <b>of</b> dendritic nucleation on another filament (birth), elongation by addition of actin subunits and, finally, termination <b>of</b> <b>filament</b> growth by capping protein (death). The regularity of branch angle between daughter and mother filaments endows <b>filaments</b> with heredity <b>of</b> their orientation. Fluctuations of branch angle that become fixed in the actin network create errors of orientation (mutations) that may be inherited. In our model, birth and death rates depend on filament orientation, which then becomes a selectable trait. Differential reproduction and elimination <b>of</b> <b>filaments,</b> or natural selection, leads to the evolution <b>of</b> a <b>filament</b> pattern with a characteristic distribution <b>of</b> <b>filament</b> orientations. We develop a procedure based on the Radon transform for quantitatively analyzing actin networks in situ and show that the experimental results are in agreement with the distribution <b>of</b> <b>filament</b> orientations predicted by our model.
