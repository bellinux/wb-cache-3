5|$|Because of the {{specialized}} and rare circumstances {{required for a}} biological structure to fossilize, logic dictates that known fossils represent <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> all life-forms that ever existed—and that each discovery represents only a snapshot of evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which never demonstrate an exact half-way point between clearly divergent forms.|$|E

5|$|Estimating {{the exact}} {{rate at which}} GRBs occur is difficult; for a galaxy of {{approximately}} {{the same size as}} the Milky Way, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E

5|$|Holland {{suggests}} {{that under the}} reign of Arab Emperor Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, even though <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> {{the inhabitants of the}} Empire was Muslim, Mecca was intentionally yet erroneously portrayed as Muhammad's home and the birthplace of Islam in order to provide the religion with Arabian origins. Holland argues that in doing so, the faith was dissociated from the Jewish or Christian heritage that would have been self evident at a location in the Negev.|$|E
5|$|NextWorth is an {{electronics}} trade-in and recycling service. Users {{of the service}} exchange used electronics for cash or discounts on newer models. NextWorth was founded by business students at Babson College in 2005. It started as a commission-based service to help businesses setup online auctions for their used items, then changed its business model to focus on electronics trade-ins in 2006. As of late 2012, NextWorth {{was one of the}} best-known and largest electronics trade-in and recycling services in the United States, although it handles <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> total trade-in traffic.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{indirect}} and intangible {{costs of the}} eruption.

The Humber ports of Grimsby and Immingham (counted {{as a single}} port for {{statistical}} purposes) are the busiest in the UK in terms of tonnage, serving 59.1 million tons as of 2015, and Teesport and the Port of Liverpool are also among the country's largest – in total, 35% of British freight was shipped through Northern ports. Roll-on/roll-off ferries offer passenger and freight connections to the Isle of Man and Ireland along the west coast, while east coast ports connect to Belgium and the Netherlands, although Northern ports handle <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the UK's vehicle traffic.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began on}} 21 January 1997, under the {{supervision}} of a three-judge panel led by Mikaela Warsito. After both sides were unable to come to an amicable settlement, a several-month-long trial began, in which Udin's family, Bernas reporters, and the police testified. On 7 April 1997, Wuryanto was convicted of destroying evidence for taking the blood, which Marisyem's lawyers speculated was used to frame Sumaji. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the damages were awarded, after the court ruled that testimony from Udin's family– whom they saw as having a conflict of interest in the outcome of the case– was ineligible.|$|E
5|$|An ectomycorrhizal species, S.pungens {{forms an}} {{intimate}} mutualistic relationship between its underground mycelium {{and the young}} roots of the associated host tree. The fungus—limited in distribution to California—fruits almost exclusively with Monterey and bishop pine, two trees with small and scattered natural ranges concentrated in the West Coast of the United States. Several studies have investigated the role of S.pungens in the coastal Californian forest ecosystem it occupies. Although the species produces more fruit bodies than other competing ectomycorrhizal fungi in the same location, {{it is not a}} dominant root colonizer, and occupies <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> ectomycorrhizal root tips. The fungus's propensity to fruit prolifically despite minimal root colonization is a result of its ability to efficiently transfer nutrients from its host for its own use.|$|E

5|$|Hastily deployed, {{the first}} {{contingent}} of AIF was essentially untrained and suffered from widespread equipment shortages. In early 1915 the AIF was largely an inexperienced force, with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> its members having previous combat experience. However, many officers and non-commissioned personnel (NCOs) had previously {{served in the}} pre-war permanent or part-time forces, and {{a significant proportion of}} the enlisted personnel had received some basic military instruction as part of Australia's compulsory training scheme. Predominantly a fighting force based on infantry battalions and light horse regiments, the AIF had a high proportion of close combat troops to support personnel. Nevertheless, the AIF eventually included a large number of logistics and administrative units which were capable of meeting most of the force's needs, and in some circumstances provided support to nearby allied units. Each division also included a range of combat support and service units, including artillery, machine-gun, mortar, engineer, pioneer, signals, logistic, medical, veterinary and administrative units. Corps troops included light horse, army artillery, and cyclists. Regardless, the AIF mainly relied on the British Army for medium and heavy artillery support and other weapons systems necessary for combined arms warfare that were developed later in the war, including aircraft and tanks.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the European population before industrialization lived in rural communities or isolated farms and households. The norm was self-sufficiency with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> production being exported or sold in markets. Large towns were exceptions and required their surrounding hinterlands to support them with food and fuel. The dense urban population could support {{a wide variety of}} food establishments that catered to various social groups. Many of the poor city dwellers had to live in cramped conditions without access to a kitchen or even a hearth, and many did not own the equipment for basic cooking. Food from vendors was in such cases the only option. Cookshops could either sell ready-made hot food, an early form of fast food, or offer cooking services while the customers supplied {{some or all of the}} ingredients. Travellers, such as pilgrims en route to a holy site, made use of professional cooks to avoid having to carry their provisions with them. For the more affluent, there were many types of specialist that could supply various foods and condiments: cheesemongers, pie bakers, saucers, waferers, etc. Well-off citizens who had the means to cook at home could on special occasions hire professionals when their own kitchen or staff could not handle the burden of throwing a major banquet.|$|E

5|$|Yet another {{important}} issue {{during the campaign}} {{was that of the}} languages in the country. The status of the Swedish and Russian languages was an hot-button issue. A growing number of people believe that the Swedish language should be abolished as the country's second official language, as <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the country use Swedish as their first language and {{that a large number of}} government officials do not use Swedish. A report by the Council of Europe stated that the Swedish language's status as Finland's second official language was in danger of being eroded in the longer term because of the officials' poor language skills and the lack of opportunities to study the language. However, the status of Russian was considered to be rising as several municipalities in eastern Finland sought to increase the role of the language at local schools. At the time, Swedish was spoken by 5.42% of the population as their mother tongue, with Russian spoken by 1.01% and the Sami languages spoken by 0.03%.|$|E
