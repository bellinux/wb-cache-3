5|$|The {{history of}} {{observations}} <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> {{is marked by}} the oppositions <b>of</b> <b>Mars,</b> when the planet is closest to Earth and hence is most easily visible, which occur every couple of years. Even more notable are the perihelic oppositions <b>of</b> <b>Mars,</b> which occur every 15 or 17 years and are distinguished because Mars is close to perihelion, making it even closer to Earth.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Leipzig in 1862–64, German {{astronomer}} Johann K. F. Zöllner {{developed a}} custom photometer {{to measure the}} reflectivity of the Moon, planets and bright stars. For Mars, he derived an albedo of 0.27. Between 1877 and 1893, German astronomers Gustav Müller and Paul Kempf observed Mars using Zöllner's photometer. They found a small phase coefficient—the variation in reflectivity with angle—indicating that the surface <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> is smooth and without large irregularities. In 1867, French astronomer Pierre Janssen and British astronomer William Huggins used spectroscopes to examine the atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>Mars.</b> Both compared the optical spectrum <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> {{to that of the}} Moon. As the spectrum of the latter did not display absorption lines of water, they believed they had detected the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>Mars.</b> This result was confirmed by German astronomer Herman C. Vogel in 1872 and English astronomer Edward W. Maunder in 1875, but would later come into question.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{records of}} the {{appearances}} and motions <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> appear before {{the founding of the}} Zhou Dynasty (1045 BCE), and by the Qin Dynasty (221 BCE) astronomers maintained close records of planetary conjunctions, including those <b>of</b> <b>Mars.</b> Occultations <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> by Venus were noted in 368, 375, and 405 CE. The period and motion of the planet's orbit was known in detail during the Tang Dynasty (618 CE).|$|E

5|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century, Tycho Brahe {{measured}} the diurnal parallax <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> that Johannes Kepler {{used to make}} a preliminary calculation of the relative distance to the planet. When the telescope became available, the diurnal parallax <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> was again measured in an effort to determine the Sun-Earth distance. This was first performed by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1672. The early parallax measurements were hampered by the quality of the instruments. The only occultation <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> by Venus observed was that of October 13, 1590, seen by Michael Maestlin at Heidelberg. In 1610, Mars was viewed by Galileo Galilei, who was first to see it via telescope. The first person to draw a map <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> that displayed any terrain features was the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens.|$|E
5|$|Father Secchi {{produced}} {{some of the}} first color illustrations <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> in 1863. He used the names of famous explorers for the distinct features. In 1869, he observed two dark linear features on the surface that he referred to as canali, which is Italian for 'channels' or 'grooves'. In 1867, English astronomer Richard A. Proctor created a more detailed map <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> based on the 1864 drawings of English astronomer William R. Dawes. Proctor named the various lighter or darker features after astronomers, past and present, who had contributed to the observations <b>of</b> <b>Mars.</b> During the same decade, comparable maps and nomenclature were produced by the French astronomer Camille Flammarion and the English astronomer Nathan Green.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, American {{astronomer}} William W. Campbell {{found that}} the spectrum <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> was identical to the spectrum of the Moon, throwing doubt on the burgeoning theory that the atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> {{is similar to that}} of the Earth. Previous detections of water in the atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> were explained by unfavorable conditions, and Campbell determined that the water signature came entirely from the Earth's atmosphere. Although he agreed that the ice caps did indicate there was water in the atmosphere, he did not believe the caps were sufficiently large to allow the water vapor to be detected. At the time, Campbell's results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of the astronomical community, but they were confirmed by American astronomer Walter S. Adams in 1925.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, Dutch {{graduate}} student Cyprianus Annius van den Bosch made {{a determination of}} the mass <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> based upon the motions of the Martian moons, with an accuracy of 0.2%. This result was confirmed by the Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter and published posthumously in 1938. Using observations of the near Earth asteroid Eros from 1926 to 1945, German-American astronomer Eugene K. Rabe {{was able to make}} an independent estimate the mass <b>of</b> <b>Mars,</b> {{as well as the other}} planets in the inner Solar System, from the planet's gravitational perturbations of the asteroid. His estimated margin of error was 0.05%, but subsequent checks suggested his result was poorly determined compared to other methods.|$|E
5|$|In the 5th century CE, the Indian astronomical text Surya Siddhanta {{estimated}} the angular size <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> as 2arc-minutes (1/30 of a degree) and its distance to Earth as 10,433,000km (1,296,600yojana, where one yojana {{is equivalent to}} eightkm in the Surya Siddhanta). From this the diameter <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> is deduced to be 6,070km (754.4 yojana), which has an error within 11% of the currently accepted value of 6,788km.

5|$|On October 13, 1590, the German {{astronomer}} Michael Maestlin observed an occultation <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> by Venus.

After the completion of his education, Kepler became an assistant to the Danish nobleman and astronomer, Tycho Brahe.

After repeatedly failing to fit the motion <b>of</b> <b>Mars</b> into a circular orbit as required under Copernicanism, he succeeded in matching Tycho's observations by assuming the orbit was an ellipse and the Sun was located {{at one of the}} foci.
