5|$|The fleet {{made its}} first {{landfall}} at Cozumel, and Cortés remained there for several days. Maya temples were cast down and a Christian cross was put up <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> At Cozumel, Cortés heard rumours of bearded men on the Yucatán mainland, who he presumed were Europeans. Cortés sent out messengers to them {{and was able to}} rescue the shipwrecked Gerónimo de Aguilar, who had been enslaved by a Maya lord. Aguilar had learnt the Yucatec Maya language and became Cortés' interpreter.|$|E
5|$|On December 23, 2009, Schroeder {{was named}} to the American team for the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, his third {{straight}} appearance at the World Junior Championships. The only player on the American team to play in two previous World Junior tournaments, Schroeder was also the first player from the University of Minnesota to participate in three tournaments. In a quarter-final match against Finland Schroeder notched three assists, including his 26th career point in the tournament, which surpassed Jeremy Roenick for the highest career total for an American. His 20 career assists was the third highest total {{in the history of the}} tournament. In the gold-medal game against Canada, Schroeder led the American team in shots on goal with six, scoring a goal <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> He finished with three goals and five assists in seven games as the Americans won the gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab will bang its pincers <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins on}} April 1, with Makoto {{awakening}} from a nightmare {{of a girl}} dying on April 6 with a bell in her hand. As the week goes on, he occasionally experiences premonitions of the future, all of which come true. Depending on the player's choices, Makoto ends up getting close {{to one of the}} girls, and on April 5, the story branches into different routes focusing <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> In each route, the girl Makoto was close to dies on April 6 with a bell in her hand. Afterwards, Makoto finds that he has traveled back in time to April 1, retaining the memories of the previous six days. Concluding that he is trapped in an infinite loop, he vows to keep the girl alive and break free of the loop. He does so by rebuilding his relationships with her while dealing with the emotional problem troubling her. On April 6, the girl ends up in a situation similar to when she died in the last loop, but Makoto saves her, breaking free of the loop and becoming her boyfriend.|$|E

25|$|Gerald Cohen, in {{his essay}} 'Complete Bullshit', has cited the 'Althusserian school' {{as an example of}} 'bullshit' and a factor in his co-founding the 'Non-Bullshit Marxism Group'. He says that 'the ideas that the Althusserians generated, for example, of the {{interpellation}} of the subject, or of contradiction and overdetermination, possessed a surface allure, but it often seemed impossible {{to determine whether or not}} the theses in which those ideas figured were true, and, at other times, those theses seemed capable of just two interpretations: <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> they were true but uninteresting, and, on the other, they were interesting, but quite obviously false'.|$|E
25|$|Once the contestant's Audience Match {{winnings}} {{were determined}} they then faced the Star Wheel {{to determine the}} stake for the Head-to-Head Match, with a maximum amount of $10,000 available. The Star Wheel was slightly modified for this Match Game series, as the contestant did not spin the actual wheel {{and there were no}} stars under the celebrities' names. Instead the wheel was fixed in place and the contestant spun a green arrow attached to its rim {{in order to determine the}} celebrity. Each celebrity had two red dots placed under their name and the stake was doubled if the wheel landed <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Dormitory of the Royal Pages (Hasoda Koğuşu) {{houses the}} Imperial Portraits Collection (Padişah Portreleri Sergi Salonu) {{was part of}} the Sultan's chambers. The painted portraits depict all the Ottoman sultans and some rare {{photographs}} of the later ones, the latter being kept in glass cases. The room is air-conditioned and the temperature regulated and monitored to protect the paintings. Since the sultans rarely appeared in public, and to respect Islamic sensitivity to artistic depictions of people, the earlier portraits are idealisations. Only since the reforms of the moderniser Mahmud II have realistic portraits of the rulers been made. An interesting feature is a large painted family tree of the Ottoman rulers. The domed chamber is supported by pillars, some of Byzantine origin since a cross is engraved <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{arrived at}} Omsk at 0:30 and was refueled with 38 tons of jet fuel. 5 hours after landing, the four engine propfan lifted off the runway {{on its way}} to Yakutsk for cold weather testing. Within seconds of becoming airborne one of the Progress D-27 engines with Contra-rotating propellers reached an over-speed condition and automatically shut down. The forward propeller stopped rotating but {{due to the nature of}} the failure the aft propeller kept turning, producing negative thrust. At this point the flight crew increased power to the remaining three engines but a problem with the RPM sensors <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> led to automatic engine shut-off. Thus, the An-70 ended up flying at low speed with only two properly functioning engines, with the third engine generating over 11,000 pounds of negative thrust and disrupting airflow across the wing.|$|E
25|$|New England had {{narrowly}} {{defeated the}} Dolphins 14-12 {{in a tough}} defensive struggle during the last Monday night game of the regular season, and this playoff game would have similar results. The Patriots' defense held Miami to 162 total yards of offense, 42 rushing yards and forced three Dolphins turnovers. Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino completed only 17 of 43 passes for 141 yards and was intercepted twice. He also fumbled the ball twice, losing a turnover <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> This {{was the first time}} in Marino's 15-year career (including 14 postseason games) that he did not throw a touchdown pass in a playoff game. Without star running back Curtis Martin, New England could only generate 228 offensive yards, but their ball security turned out to be key as they avoided losing any turnovers for the entire game.|$|E
25|$|For once, Vang Pao's American backers {{did not try}} to {{discourage}} a wet season offensive. Planning was {{based on the assumption that}} Vang Pao would have at least 11, and possibly 13, regiments available to him by mid-September 1972. By launching five small attacks, it was hoped that the Communist would be too overwhelmed to concentrate <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> A two phase plan of attack was formed. Phase one, planned to start on 15 August, would draw PAVN reinforcements southwestward of the Plain of Jars while capturing the mountaintop position at Phou Seu. Then, two regiments of guerrillas would be landed in the vacuum behind the front lines thus caused by the PAVN's forward movement. Phase two would follow on with two road interdictions planned to starve out the PAVN, followed by establishment of an interlocking network of artillery fire bases after the Communists withdrew. Not figured in the Royalist calculations was the determination of PAVN General Vũ Lập to alter Communist policy and maintain PAVN's positions on the Plain through the rainy season monsoon.|$|E

He finds that her parents met by a chance encounter caused by a gust of wind blowing a leaf into her father's face and discovers that her mother died while Clara was a teenager. The Doctor goes back to the present and collects Clara, then takes her to the Rings of Akhaten, where they observe a series of planetoids orbiting a planet, with a shining pyramid <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The Doctor takes Clara to a giant alien marketplace and introduces her to several aliens, including a merchant named Dor'een who attempts to rent them a space bike. The market does not use hard currency but rather trades in items of sentimental value; this appalls Clara, who believes sentimental items should be cherished and not given away. She becomes separated from the Doctor and encounters a little girl (Emilia Jones) who appears to be running and hiding. Clara catches up to her and she explains that her name is Merry Galel, the Queen of Years. Merry tells Clara that she is hiding because she is supposed to sing a song at a ceremony and she is afraid to get it wrong. Clara reassures her by telling her what her mother once said, and Merry heads to the ceremony.|$|E
