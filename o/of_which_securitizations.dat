40|$|The {{debate about}} the role of {{structured}} finance securities like ABS or CDOs in the subprime crisis is representative for a gap in the theory <b>of</b> <b>securitization</b> <b>which</b> in the past was focused on valuation and hedging issues. The area of real-world credit risk analysis which is the foundation for risk and capital management was largely neglected. In this paper we examine structuring risks as well as intrinsic credit risks of structured securitizations from a theoretical perspective. We derive analytical results for the high systematic risk factor sensitivity of tranches, the consequences of flawed pool risk parameters and risk factor forecasts on the capital structure and its risks, as well as the specific role of point-in-time and through-the-cycle ratings. Contrary to other studies we treat the capital structure not as exogenous but rather as endogenous quantity. Our results reveal several potentials for improvement in terms of quantitative risk management...|$|R

40|$|Owing to the agentification of the Government Housing Loan Corporation, Japanese private {{financial}} institutions are now developing long-term fixed-rate loans. In {{order to reduce}} the risk of yielding mismatches between asset and liability, {{financial institutions}} will sell out their loans by securitization instead of holding loans themselves. Mortgage backed security (MBS) is a product <b>of</b> mortgage <b>securitization,</b> <b>which</b> is issued backed by the repayment cash flow from a loan pool consisting of many mortgage loans. In mortgage loans, borrowers are basically allowed to make prepayment. Repayment cash flow from a loan pool changes due to the prepayment. So there is a prepayment riskin MBS, which means that investors cannot invest excessive liquidity in a planned yield or duration when prepayment occurs faster than forecast. Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO) is a form <b>of</b> MBS, in <b>which</b> repayment cash flow from a loan pool is reorganized and bonds with various risks are issued. In this paper, we propose a method of designing CMO with PAC-Companion structure.

We find that securitization results in some transfer of risk out of the originating bank but that risk remains in the securitizing bank as a result of implicit recourse. Clearly, then, securitization with implicit recourse provides an important means of avoiding minimum capital requirements. We also find, however, that securitizing banks set their capital relative to managed assets according to market perceptions of their risk and seem not to be motivated by maximizing implicit subsidies relating to the government safety net when managing their risk.

The competition of banks lowers the lending rate, which in turn results in a low deposit rate. Consequently, a low level of credit supply coexists with some uninvested high-return projects. The shortage of credit supply resulting from bank competition naturally motivates banks to sell their assets through securities in order to raise more funds to invest in the projects being rationed. ...|$|R
40|$|Background & Problem discussion: The {{relative}} {{low interest}} {{rate in the}} first part of the new millennium spurred on demand for mortgage financing and by extension also fueled the housing market, primarily in the United States. Subprime loans were incorporated into and repackaged into various ABS. As the house prices declined and the subprime mortgages resetting at increasingly higher rates of interest, borrower defaults. Many equity and mezzanine tranches of MBSs and by extension CDOs were wiped out. The problem <b>of</b> not knowing <b>which</b> <b>securitization</b> investments were good and which were bad led to a halt in investment altogether. Aim and purpose: The main purpose of this study is to qualitatively explore the information exchange between originator and investor of a CDO security. A further purpose of this study is to complement the existing research in the mapping of a CDO transaction. Methodology: This paper examines the human factor in the originator-investor environment of a CDO transaction. Thus, a qualitative approach to the problem is used. Interviews with people at some of the largest financial institutions of the market, actively involved in the investment decision on both originator and investor side has been conducted. Results: The study shows that there exists a mismatch in the information supplied by the participating originators and what is actually demanded by the investors, for purposes of investing in CDOs. The informational demand from the investors reaches beyond the current disclosure requirements enforced by the SEC, and encompasses such intangible aspects that could never be fully conveyed through an investment prospectus such originator brand name. It appears that the perceived success or failure of a CDO relies to a great extent on the individuals involved, and not so much on the structure of the CDO or its underlying assets. In that sense, the human factor, intangible values and the issue of trust surfaces as more incorporated into the decision making processes. In that sense, the term “conveyed information” should encompass a broader definition than the just the investment prospectus. However, if this will be sufficient enough for an investor to make an informed investment decision warrants further studies from the standpoints of the findings of this paper...|$|R

40|$|In 2014 the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) {{described}} the Ebola outbreak then ongoing in West Africa as ‘a threat to {{international peace and}} security’ (Resolution 2177).

This article assesses the significance of Resolution 2177 as an instrument of health governance, with particular regard to the Council’s primary aim in the resolution: to bring about the lifting of state-imposed bans on travel to and from West Africa. As travel bans were arguably a harmful move to securitize a disease at the national level, the UNSC’s response might at first appear to have been an international-level attempt to remove Ebola from the realm of security policy for the sake of public health. However, the use of threat language in Resolution 2177, and the rapid mobilization of disease-control resources by some governments represented on the Council, suggests that some kind of security logic was driving the international response to Ebola. It was not the logic <b>of</b> <b>securitization</b> <b>which</b> some other governments, intent upon using borders as barriers to contagion, were apparently applying. Rather, to counteract this, the UNSC appears to have acted according to the security logic of governmentality whereby the health of populations (within and beyond West Africa) would be secured by facilitating cross-border circulation of people with medical expertise. The Council’s contribution to health governance on this occasion was to support a shift in security logic: from securitization to securing circulation...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until June 2018. The impact of neo-liberal {{globalisation}} on the nation-state {{has been extensively}} studied in terms of politico-economic restructuring and forms of governmentality and securitisation. While the former speaks of a process of de-nationalisation, the latter brings about a re-nationalisation process. In both cases, though, the focus has only been on one component of the nation-state, i. e. the state. The nation has either been treated as a given backdrop or merely ignored. This articles aims to bring the nation back {{as a way to}} better contextualise practices of socio-spatial exclusion associated with one particular aspect of neoliberal globalisation, namely international migration. By analysing parliamentary debates in Italy between 1986 and 2014, the article explores the intersections between neoliberalism and cultural essentialism as they conflate in what I call the ‘neoliberal culturalist nation’. This construct permits to identify the role that a national culturalist imaginary plays in prompting and justifying governmental practices <b>of</b> <b>securitization,</b> <b>which</b> in turn are implicated in the production of vulnerable and expendable labour force. Moreover, it reveals how a neoliberal workfarist and individualised logic is functional to the ‘normalisation’ of the foreign immigrant and the reproduction of the national titular group. My argument is that a national culturalist imaginary exists in a mutually reinforcing relation with, rather than in opposition to neoliberalism. Far from keeping nation and state as ontologically distinct or theorising their decoupling, the article points instead to a renewed spatial isomorphism between nation and state which comes indeed to epitomise the very process of current re-nationalisation...|$|R

40|$|The first essay of my {{dissertation}} investigates how lender-specific shocks {{impact the}} strictness {{of the loan}} contract that a borrower receives. Exploiting between-bank variation in recent portfolio performance, I find evidence that banks write tighter contracts than their peers after suffering defaults to their own loan portfolios, even when defaulting borrowers are in different industries and geographic regions than the current borrower. The effects of recent defaults persist after controlling for bank capitalization, although negative bank equity shocks are also strongly associated with tighter contracts. The evidence is consistent with lenders learning about their own screening technology via defaults and adjusting contracts accordingly. Finally, contract tightening is most pronounced for borrowers who are dependent on a relatively small circle of lenders, with each incremental default implying covenant tightening equivalent {{to that of a}} ratings downgrade. The second essay examines the use of soft information in primary and secondary mortgage markets. Using a large sample of mortgage loan applications, I develop a proxy for soft information collection based on the probability that a mortgage applicant had a face-to-face meeting with a loan officer. I find that the use of soft information increases the probability of loan approval, and conditional on loan approval, reduces the interest rate charged. These loans, however, {{are less likely to be}} sold, consistent with the difficulty in credibly communicating soft information. This provides evidence of one mechanism through <b>which</b> <b>securitization</b> may affect screening. Meanwhile, preliminary evidence suggests that screening based on soft information may be valuable to lenders, with face-to-face meetings substantially reducing the growth in loan delinquencies during the recent period.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Journalism. This dissertation proposes a particular form of media framing effect from securitization, a process in which political actors seek to create consensus about security related issues such as terrorism and immigration by portraying them as imminent threats to a state's physical or cultural survival. The dissertation offers a two-stage model, in <b>which</b> <b>securitization</b> is first examined as an effect in news media accounts and then tested in an experiment as an effect of media accounts. A content analysis found that a salient example of securitization, the idea of a "war on terrorism", appeared as a consensual frame in distinct sectors of the media market after the September 2001 attacks. The frame diverged predictably in ensuing years, suggesting that the securitization frame changes in response to news organizations' sense of audience expectations and perceptions of the boundaries of political debate. The experimental portion found that securitization does not affect how accurately audiences comprehend the central point of a story but does appear to produce less attentive processing among those opposed to the government. The absence of securitization, on the other hand, appears to produce more attentive processing among those who consider themselves politically {{to the right of the}} media. Emotionally, the frame has no effect on opponents of the government but produces more trust in government among pro-government audiences and those to the right of the media...|$|R

40|$|The post-World War Two period {{witnessed}} {{an intensive}} development {{of such a}} form of international cooperation as twin cities. Stronger and more intensive cooperation between borderland municipalities of neighboring states was possible due to {{the realization of the}} fact that thanks to this integration instrument it was possible to jointly overcome crisis laden situations and phenomena. The common cultural and historical heritage maintained through this instrument contributes to normalization and thriving of border areas of states. This process is of special importance for those borders which are located between Russia and European Union and/or NATO member states. This Master’s thesis considers the role of local governments in creating the points of contact between the twin cities which stimulate in their turn larger networks of contacts at different levels. It also shows how the theory <b>of</b> <b>securitization</b> (without <b>which</b> it is impossible to imagine a Conception of twin cities) makes an impact on relations between border municipalities. I have considered the case of Narva and Ivangorod as twin cities, which currently have achieved impressive results in developing a long term and sustainable model of cooperation. In order to support the evidential base of my paper, I consider two other pairs <b>of</b> twin cities, <b>which</b> are located in situation similar to that of Narva and Ivangorod, specifically Imatra-Svetogorsk and Kirkeness- Nikel. The process <b>of</b> <b>securitization</b> <b>which</b> permeates the level of both bilateral relations (Estonia – Russia), NATO – Russia and EU-Russia levels, when reaching the inter-municipal level, bеcomes weaker and damped as if there is a “safety bag”. At the lowest level (considering the Narva-Ivangorod case), we see the detailed, preplanned cooperation, several bilateral agreements signed, visits of officials, preconditioned by the joint municipal agenda, spontaneous meetings, which are the catalysts of forming a bilateral inter-municipal cooperation. The thesis tries to prove conclusively that NATO, the EU and Estonia (on the one hand) and Russia (on the other hand) are quite interested in securing their state border safe and peaceful. Thus, in contrast to the “top power” level, at a lower (inter-municipal) level, the relations between Narva and Ivangorod have been in the desecuritized status despite the attempts made by the central governments of the states of concern and international organizations involved as well as other actors to “heat up” the situation at the both sides of the Narva river. The non-traditional actors such as the city twins (border adjacent municipalities) represent an actors in the international relations, together with the states, transnational corporations, international governmental and nongovernmental organizations.

40|$|One {{interesting}} {{explanation for}} asset securitization is the managerial agency theory – where securitization of cash flows that are relatively insensitive to managerial effort reduces the noise for cash flows that {{are sensitive to}} managerial effort (Iacobucci and Winter, 2005).

First, we differentiate the effects of noise and effort sensitivity on managerial effort and compensation, underscoring {{the importance of a}} less noisy environment. We also carefully delineate the conditions under <b>which</b> asset <b>securitization</b> would improve the welfare of managers and shareholders of the originating company. Second, we relax the assumptions regarding the expected income-producing function and the income variance, and further take into consideration the change of the marginal production of income with respect to effort before and after securitization. Third, under a multitask principal-agent model framework, we explore how the relationship between managerial activities on different assets affects the incentive compensation for the manager of the originating company and the joint surplus for shareholder and manager. This is particularly relevant when entire buildings are securitized as opposed to pools of income-generating assets. Finally, we examine the role of the third-party servicer...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a key {{property}} of asset-backed securities (ABS); namely, that ABS are designed to achieve “bankruptcy remoteness ” of the securitized assets from the borrowing firm. This provides lenders with maximal protection from dilution in bankruptcy that is not available with other contracts, such as secured debt. ABS can have real effects in allowing firms to commit to more efficient investment decisions in bankruptcy. We show that securitization of replaceable assets, such as accounts receivable, prevents inefficient continuation in bankruptcy, but securitization of neces-sary assets can lead to inefficient liquidations. In these circumstances, secured debt and/or leases can be preferred. We provide empirical support {{for the importance of}} bankruptcy remoteness in ABS contracts using a controversial decision in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of LTV Steel, in <b>which</b> a <b>securitization</b> contract was unexpectedly treated as a secured loan. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that ABS spreads for securitizers eligible for Chapter 11 increased significantly more than spreads for insured bank securitiz-ers, who are not Chapter 11 -eligible, in the period following the LTV filing. The results demonstrate that the creditor protection provided by “bankruptcy remoteness” is indeed valuable and priced in financial markets...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This study {{examines}} {{the stock market}} valuation of securitization gains reported by using the financial-components approach under FAS 125 (Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities). Design/methodology/approach – Based on a sample of US securitizing firms for the period from 1993 to 2000, I conduct two analyses to examine the extent to <b>which</b> the <b>securitization</b> gains reported under FAS 125 {{are reflected in the}} stock market valuation. Findings – The paper finds that the reported gains are positively associated with the stock returns, suggesting that the reported gains are perceived to be value relevant, and that investors appear to use gains {{in the same manner as}} they use other earnings information. In addition, it is found that the association between returns and securitization earnings is stronger in the post-FAS 125 period than in the pre-FAS 125 period, suggesting that the financial-components approach improves the capacity of reported financial statement information to explain stock returns when compared with pre-FAS 125 regulations. Research limitations/implications – The results of this study should be helpful to standard setters who continue to apply the financial-components approach for securitizations and for other transactions involving financial instruments.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper studies a {{macroeconomic}} {{model in}} which financial experts borrow from less productive agents in order to invest in financial assets. We pursue three set of results: (i) Going beyond a steady state analysis, we show that adverse shocks cause amplifying price declines not only through the erosion of net worth of the financial sector, but also through increased price volatility, leading to precautionary hoarding and fire sales. (ii) Financial sector’s leverage and maturity mismatch is excessive, since it does not internalize externalities it imposes on the labor sector and other financial experts due to a fire-sale externality. (iii) <b>Securitization,</b> <b>which</b> allows the financial sector to offload some risk, exacerbates the excessive risk-taking. † We thank Nobu Kiyotaki, Hyun Shin and seminar participants at Princeton, HKU Theory Conference...|$|R
