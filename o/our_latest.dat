Shall send at once <b>our</b> <b>latest</b> battleship--the Woodrow--new design, both ends alike, escorted by double-ended coal barges the Wilson, the President, the Professor and the Thinker. Shall take firm stand on American rights. Piccolo Domingo must either surrender the American alive, or give him to us dead.|$|E
