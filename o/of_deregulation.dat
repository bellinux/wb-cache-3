5|$|Electricity {{is a very}} {{convenient}} way {{to transfer}} energy, {{and it has been}} adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction <b>of</b> <b>deregulation</b> in the electrical power sector.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession <b>of</b> <b>deregulation,</b> in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E

25|$|Reynaud, however, {{had always}} wanted the Finance ministry. He {{endorsed}} radically liberal economic policies in order to draw France's economy out of stagnation, centered on a massive program <b>of</b> <b>deregulation,</b> including {{the elimination of the}} forty-hour work week. The notion <b>of</b> <b>deregulation</b> was very popular among France's businessmen, and Reynaud believed that it was the best way for France to regain investors' confidence again and escape the stagnation its economy had fallen into. The collapse of Léon Blum's government in 1938 was a response to Blum's attempt to expand the regulatory powers of the French government; there was therefore considerable support in the French government for an alternative approach like Reynaud's.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the impact <b>of</b> the <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> the Norwegian {{pharmaceuticals}} market in 2001 on costs and availability of pharmaceutical products. Data has been collected from the annual reports of a sample of Norwegian pharmacies before and after the <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> the market. In addition, data regarding the number of pharmacies in each region in Norway has also been collected. In order to study costs, a translog function is estimated. Regressin models for the number of pharmacies in each region in Norway are also estimated. The results show that the costs of the individual pharmacies have not decreased as a consequence <b>of</b> the <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> the Norwegian pharmaceuticals market. The <b>deregulation</b> <b>of</b> the market did, however, increase the availability to pharmacy services substantially. The number of pharmacies increased from 392 in year 2000 to 524 in June 2004.

In 1978, Moritz Suter founded a regional airline named Crossair, which put Swissair under additional stress.

This strategy diversified economic risks {{at the expense}} of the core business of Swissair – commercial aviation.|$|E
