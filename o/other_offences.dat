Amongst those arrested were Générals Daniel KATSUVA wa Katsuvira, Land Forces Chief of Staff, UTSHUDI Wembolenga, Commandant of the 2nd Military Region at Kalemie; FALLU Sumbu, Military Attaché of Zaïre in Washington, Colonel MUDIAYI wa Mudiayi, the military attaché of Zaïre in Paris, the military attache in Brussels, a paracommando battalion commander, and several others. The regime alleged these officers and others (including Mobutu's civil secrétaire particulier) had plotted the assassination of Mobutu, high treason, and disclosure of military secrets, among <b>other</b> <b>offences.</b> The alleged coup was investigated by a revolutionary commission headed by Boyenge Mosambay Singa, at that time head of the Gendarmerie. Writing in 1988, Michael Schatzberg said the full details of the coup had yet to emerge.|$|E

25|$|In 1718 Peter {{made him}} one of his six {{adjutant}} generals, and governor of Astrakhan. In this post Volynsky displayed distinguished administrative and financial talents. In 1722 he married Alexandra Naryshkina, Peter's cousin. The same year he was accused of peculation and <b>other</b> <b>offences</b> to the emperor, who caned him severely and deprived him of his plenipotentiary powers, despite his undeniable services in Persia, but for which Peter could never have emerged so triumphantly from the difficult Persian war of 1722-1723.|$|E

25|$|Ethiopia's former Soviet-backed Marxist {{dictator}} Mengistu Haile Mariam {{was tried}} in an Ethiopian court, in absentia, {{for his role}} in mass killings. Mengistu's charge sheet and evidence list covered 8,000 pages. The evidence against him included signed execution orders, videos of torture sessions and personal testimonies. The trial began in 1994 and on 12 December 2006 Mengistu was found guilty of genocide and <b>other</b> <b>offences.</b> He was {{sentenced to life in prison}} in January 2007. Ethiopian law includes attempts to annihilate political groups in its definition of genocide.|$|E
25|$|Once a case came to court, {{the method}} used {{to come to a}} {{decision}} was usually by compurgation. Under this system the person accused or the parties to a dispute would give their version under oath, following which they had to find a number of others who would take an oath that the principal's oath could be trusted. The number of compurgators required depended {{on the nature of the}} case. The judge or judges would then come to a decision. Capital punishment was only prescribed for a small number of crimes. Homicide was usually dealt with by the payment of compensation to the victim's family, while theft could be punished by death only if it was theft by stealth and the thief was caught with the goods in hand; the value of the goods stolen also had to exceed four pence. Most <b>other</b> <b>offences</b> were punished by a fine.|$|E
25|$|Penalties {{are awarded}} {{if a player}} is caught offside, is {{involved}} in foul play, offends at the tackle, ruck or maul, or is involved in dangerous play at scrums and line-outs. Foul play includes intentionally or repeatedly offending, throwing the ball into touch, obstructing the opposition, or misconduct. Examples of misconduct are striking, stamping, kicking or tripping players, illegal tackles and contact with players after they have kicked the ball. Dangerous play at line-outs is pushing, charging, obstructing or levering on an opponent. Dangerous play at scrums is charging at opponents not correctly binding to opponents, the hooker swinging (using both feet to strike the ball), twisting, dipping or lifting an opponent collapsing. <b>Other</b> <b>offences</b> that result in penalties are if a team has too many players, wearing illegal clothing, throwing the ball deliberately into touch, intentionally knocking the ball on, not releasing the ball if taking into touch, incorrect numbers in a scrum, handing in the scrum and the scrumhalf kicking {{the ball in the}} scrum.|$|E
50|$|A fine or mulct {{is money}} that {{a court of}} law or other {{authority}} decides has to be paid as punishment for a crime or <b>other</b> <b>offence.</b> The amount of a fine can be determined case by case, but it is often announced in advance.|$|R

25|$|As World War II began, Geisel {{turned to}} {{political}} cartoons, drawing over 400 {{in two years}} as editorial cartoonist for the left-leaning New York City daily newspaper, PM. Geisel's political cartoons, later published in Dr. Seuss Goes to War, denounced Hitler and Mussolini and were highly critical of non-interventionists ("isolationists"), most notably Charles Lindbergh, who opposed US entry into the war. One cartoon depicted all Japanese Americans as latent traitors or fifth-columnists, while other cartoons simultaneously deplored the racism at home against Jews and blacks that harmed the war effort. His cartoons were strongly supportive of President Roosevelt's handling of the war, combining the usual exhortations to ration {{and contribute to the}} war effort with frequent attacks on Congress (especially the Republican Party), parts of the press (such as the New York Daily News, Chicago Tribune, and Washington Times-Herald), and others for criticism of Roosevelt, criticism of aid to the Soviet Union, investigation of suspected Communists, and <b>other</b> <b>offences</b> that he depicted as leading to disunity and helping the Nazis, intentionally or inadvertently.|$|E
25|$|If {{a defender}} violently attacks an {{opponent}} within the penalty area, a penalty shot is awarded. Certain <b>other</b> <b>offences,</b> when carried out within the penalty area, {{result in a}} penalty shot provided there is a goal situation. These include a defender holding or hooking an attacker, or blocking a goal situation with a lifted skate, thrown stick or glove and so on. Also, the defenders (with {{the exception of the}} goal-keeper) are not allowed to kneel or lie on the ice. The final offences that might mandate a penalty shot are those of hitting or blocking an opponent's stick or touching the ball with the hands, arms, stick or head. If any of these actions is carried out in a non-goal situation, they shall be awarded with a free-stroke from one of the free-stroke spots at the penalty area line. A penalty shot should always be accompanied by a 5 or 10 minutes penalty (see below). If the penalty results in a goal, the penalty should be considered personal meaning that a substitute can be sent in for the penalised player. This does not apply {{in the event of a}} red card (see below).|$|E
25|$|In 1808 Romilly had {{the death}} penalty removed for pickpockets and lesser offenders, {{starting}} a process of reform that continued over the next 50 years. The death penalty was mandatory (although it was frequently commuted by the government) until the Judgement of Death Act 1823 gave judges the power to commute {{the death penalty}} except for treason and murder. The Punishment of Death, etc. Act 1832 {{reduced the number of}} capital crimes by two-thirds. In 1832, the death penalty was abolished for theft, counterfeiting, and forgery except for the forgery of wills and certain powers of attorney. Gibbeting was abolished in 1832 and hanging in chains was abolished in 1834. In 1837, the death penalty for forging wills and powers of attorney was abolished. The death penalty for rape was abolished in 1841. In 1861, several acts of Parliament (24 & 25 Vict; c. 94 to c. 100) further reduced the number of civilian capital crimes to five: murder, treason, espionage, arson in royal dockyards, and piracy with violence; there were <b>other</b> <b>offences</b> under military law. The death penalty remained mandatory for treason and murder unless commuted by the monarch.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{clashes between}} rival gangs {{involved}} large numbers; the Gorton Reporter described one such instance in May 1879 as involving more than 500 people.

25|$|The TPLF has {{associated}} {{itself with}} gender equality {{since the days}} of armed conflict, when, in the northern states, Tigrean and some Amhara women soldiers fought together with men against the Derg dictatorship. Meles Zenawi's administration, along with First Lady Azeb Mesfin, have strongly advocated for more equal rights and opportunities for women in Ethiopia. Despite the country having a rich history of respected queens and empresses, Meles inherited a national situation in which Ethiopian women did not have equality or basic rights. Since his administration began, there has been a steady growth of women's organizations, women activists and employment opportunities and a forum where women discuss backward cultural issues on national television. In their long fight against destructive traditional practices, HIV transmission, early marriage, lack of legal rights for women, unfair public policies, job opportunity and other issues, various organizations continue to work with the government including the Ethiopian Women’s Lawyers Association (EWLA), Network of Ethiopian Women's Associations, the Ethiopia Media Women’s Association (MWA), the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), Women in Self Employment (WISE), the Ethiopian Medical Women's Association (EMWA), the Women’s Association of Tigray (WAT), the Kembatti Mentti Gezzima-tope (KMG), the Ethiopian Nurse Midwives Association (ENA) and others. The Ethiopian leadership has made significant advances to protect women's rights in recent years. It has its first Minister of Women's Affairs and has overhauled legislation on rape, female genital mutilation, and <b>other</b> <b>offences.</b>|$|E
25|$|Anglo-Saxon women {{appear to}} have enjoyed {{considerable}} independence, whether as abbesses of the great 'double monasteries' of monks and nuns founded during the seventh and eighth centuries, as major land-holders recorded in Domesday Book (1086), or as ordinary members of society. They could act as principals in legal transactions, were entitled to the same wergild as men of the same class, and were considered 'oath-worthy', {{with the right to}} defend themselves on oath against false accusations or claims. Sexual and <b>other</b> <b>offences</b> against them were penalised heavily. There is evidence that even married women could own property independently, and some surviving wills are in the joint names of husband and wife. Marriage comprised a contract between the woman's family and the prospective bridegroom, who was required to pay a 'bride-price' in advance of the wedding and a 'morning gift' following its consummation. The latter became the woman's personal property, but the former may have been paid to her relatives, at least during the early period. Widows were in a particularly favourable position, with inheritance rights, custody of their children and authority over dependants. However, a degree of vulnerability may be reflected in laws stating that they should not be forced into nunneries or second marriages against their will. The system of primogeniture (inheritance by the first-born male) was not introduced to England until after the Norman Conquest, so Anglo-Saxon siblings — girls as well as boys — were more equal in terms of status. The age of majority was usually either ten or twelve, when a child could legally take charge of inherited property, or be held responsible for a crime. It was common for children to be fostered, either in other households or in monasteries, perhaps as a means of extending the circle of protection beyond the kin group. Laws also make provision for orphaned children and foundlings.|$|E
