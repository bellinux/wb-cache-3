25|$|The {{original}} Cubist {{architecture is}} very rare.

Cubist architecture flourished {{for the most}} part between 1910–1914, but the Cubist or Cubism-influenced buildings were also built after the World War I.

5|$|As a child, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana {{was sent}} {{to live in a}} village that his father named Ambohimanga.

He declared Ambohimanga the capital of the region, building numerous structures on the site and adding its first set of defensive walls, ditches and gates. The site's historic and cultural significance was recognized in 2001 when UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site, the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cultural category in Madagascar. He became an independent king upon his father's death and the resulting partition of the Kingdom of Imerina in 1710, from which he received Avaradrano, the easternmost and largest territory.

5|$|As {{the storm}} {{crossed over the}} Florida panhandle and southeastern Georgia, the winds {{weakened}} to , although it still produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds in Savannah, Georgia. No severe damage {{was reported in the}} city. The tropical storm continued northeastward, emerging into the western Atlantic and paralleling the coastlines of the Carolinas just offshore. Several ships reported strong winds and rough seas. On October6, the storm restrengthened to its peak intensity before becoming an extratropical cyclone about 200mi (320km) southeast of Cape Cod; however, one meteorologist assessed it as acquiring extratropical characteristics after it exited Georgia into the western Atlantic. As an extratropical storm, it reached winds of 80mph (130km/h), based on a ship report south of Atlantic Canada. Late on October7, the storm was last observed to the south of Newfoundland. The storm was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season not to attain hurricane status.|$|E
5|$|Harvey made 36 as Australia made 275 batting first. England {{then took}} a 31-run lead and Harvey was out for <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second innings as the hosts won the Ashes 1–0 after 19 years in Australian hands. Harvey scored 346 runs at 34.60 for the series; in a low-scoring series, this placed him second behind captain Lindsay Hassett (365 runs at 36.50). Harvey failed to pass 41 in the four {{first-class}} matches remaining after the Tests. With the retirement Hassett {{at the end of}} the season, Harvey was to bear more responsibility in the batting line-up. In recognition of his performances during the summer, during which he scored 2040 runs at 65.40, he was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. The next highest Australian aggregate and average was 1433 at 51.17 by Miller, and the second most prolific centurymaker was Hassett with five.|$|E

His batting average of 27.55 in that competition was the second-highest amongst his team, bettered only by Jack MacBryan. Bajana hit two half-centuries during the season, scoring 77 against Derbyshire, and 59 against Essex. The following 1920 season was Bajana's last with Somerset. He appeared fifteen times for the county in first-class cricket, averaging just over twenty. In a match against Cambridge University, he achieved his highest first-class score, hitting 14 fours {{on his way to}} a total of 115 runs in 135 minutes. In his next match, he scored a second century for Somerset, and his <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> County Championship, scoring 106 runs against Warwickshire. Bajana played his final first-class match against Middlesex in August 1920, scoring six and a duck. In all, Bajana scored 1,975 first-class runs at an average of 20.78. He scored three centuries and seven half-centuries in 96 innings. He was rarely used as a bowler, and took four wickets at an average of 33.00.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Savenko {{stated that}} the passed law on the state expert {{activity}} {{and the introduction of}} the profession of forensic expert psychiatrist actually destroyed adversary-based examinations and that the Serbsky Center turned into the complete monopolist of forensic examination, which it had never been under Soviet rule. Formerly, the court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts, but now the court only chooses an expert institution. The expert has the right to participate only in commissions that he is included in by the head of his expert institution, and can receive the certificate of qualification as an expert only after having worked in a state expert institution for three years. The Director of the Serbsky Center Dmitrieva was, at the same time, the head of the forensic psychiatry department which is the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country and is located in her Center.
