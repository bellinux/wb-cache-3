40|$|Hydropower {{plants are}} {{the main source of}} {{renewable}} energy from moving water. However, traditional dam systems are somewhat controversial since they are large and often require population relocation, disrupt fish migration, and change the natural flow of the river. Hydrokinetic systems are currently being developed which can harness energy from flowing water with less ecological impact. One hydrokinetic system that may be promising, a hydrokite system, consists of an <b>oscillating</b> <b>arm,</b> boom, and a translating hydrofoil. Due to the hydrodynamic forces caused by the water 2 ̆ 7 s velocity, the hydrokite moves back and forth extracting energy from the flow. Previous simulations have shown that power production for this system depends on at least ten different parameters. Little experimental work has been done on hydrokite systems to validate the results of these simulations. This work focused on the experimental testing of a lab-scale hydrokite system. Tests were run to determine the system power trends with respect to hydrofoil angles, boom flip angles, pivot-point location on hydrofoil, tow speed, and hydrofoil submerged depth. Single dimension parameter tests were done to determine the changes in average cycle power for the system as a function of a given parameter. Power production was highly sensitive to changes in hydrofoil angles (for hydrofoils pivoting at both the quarter and half-chord point). The optimal hydrofoil angle for the tests that were run was approximately β = 60 ° - 80 °. As predicted, the power production increases with increased tow speed and submerged depth, neglecting energy used to flip the hydrofoil. Changes in boom flip angle did not significantly affect power production for the quarter-chord tests, but appeared to be significant in the half-chord tests. Although the largest power produced in all of this testing was approximately 0. 14 Watts, this initial testing of the lab-scale system has given us some insight into the important design decisions that will need to be made in order to scale-up the system...|$|E
50|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{composed}} of a SK-105 Kürassier chassis which mounts a refurbished FL-12 <b>oscillating</b> turret <b>armed</b> with a 105 mm gun, obtained from obsolete AMX-13 tanks. Both vehicles were in service with the Argentine Army in the early 2000s. Most of the Patagón technical specifications {{are similar to the}} SK-105.|$|R
5000|$|This device {{extracts}} {{the energy}} caused by wave surges {{and the movement}} of water particles within them. The <b>arm</b> <b>oscillates</b> as a pendulum mounted on a pivoted joint in response to the movement of water in the waves.|$|R
40|$|At DLR Berlin  Adlershof Research Center, the BIRD (BERLIN INFRARED DETECTOR) {{satellite}} {{is currently}} being designed, fabricated and tested for launch in late 1999. This small satellite is planned to weight about 80 kg. and measure about 500 mm on each side before the deployment of antennas and solar panels. As the primary payload, the satellite will be carrying two infrared detectors {{for the purpose of}} earth observation. The cameras will be independently mounted but observing the same field of view with a slight overlap. Due to the severe weight and volume restrictions, it is planned to use cryocoolers to ensure the necessary operating temperatures for the infrared sensors. The initially selected cryocoolers model induces significant uniaxial vibration into the satellite due to a moving piston arm and an additional pumping action. The coupling of the <b>oscillating</b> cooling <b>arm</b> to the sensor head brings the danger that the sensors orientation will not be fixed to the desired accuracy which would result in potential reductions {{of the quality of the}} scientific results. Due to volume constraints the standard approach of employing a cryostat cannot be applied, nor is it suitable to mount the cryocoolers back to back since each cryocooler is used separately for the individual infrared sensor. In the present paper an adaptive solution to counteract induced forces and resulting vibrations at the sensors heads with respect to the operational boundary conditions in space will be discussed. For this, an adaptive microvibration control system based on piezoceramic actuators and sensors is presented. Adaptive signal processing is used for the adjustment of the actuator driving signals. Digital transversal filter types combined with recursive adaptation algorithms allow self-optimizing controllers. The design of a demonstration structure and the performance of adequate experiments will be described...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of acceleration {{on a number}} of physical systems is examined. We present a full relativistic treatment of a simple harmonic oscillator with relativistic velocities. The line element for Schwarzschild geometry is expanded in a set of Cartesian coordinates and is shown to be locally equivalent (neglecting curvature) to the line element of a linearly accelerating frame of reference. We consider the rate of a linearly accelerating quantum mechanical clock and the measurement of frequency by non-inertial observers, requiring this measurement to be of finite duration. These analyses demonstrate the standard measurement hypothesis for accelerating observers only approximates the physical behaviour of these systems. We derive the output of an optical ring interferometer in a variety of experimental contexts. A full relativistic reanalysis of the modified Laub drag experiment of Sanders and Ezekiel is performed, correcting a number of errors in their work and giving an overall discrepancy between experiment and theory of 1300 ppm. We examine the behaviour of a ring interferometer containing an accelerating glass sample. Our analysis predicts sideband structure will arise when a glass sample is <b>oscillated</b> along one <b>arm</b> of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and the resulting output Fourier analysed. We also predict a resonant cavity containing a linearly accelerating glass sample will display optical ringing. A rigorous analysis of a ring interferometer with angular acceleration is presented. This predicts a resonant cavity with angular acceleration will also display optical ringing and demonstrates the beat frequency in a ring laser with angular acceleration is the instantaneous Sagnac beat frequency. Finally, we analyse the optical output of a rotating ring laser with one mirror oscillating, predicting sideband structure in spectra obtained from Fourier analysis of the beat between the opposite beams, and the beat between adjacent modes when the laser has multimode operation...|$|R
