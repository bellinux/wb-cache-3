The <b>Opposition</b> <b>Division</b> may find that the opposition is not deemed to have been filed, for instance because the opposition fee has not been paid within the nine-month opposition period, because the notice of opposition is not signed or because the notice is not in an accepted language.|$|E

25|$|During the opposition, oral {{proceedings}} may {{take place at}} the request of the EPO or at the request of any party to the proceedings, i.e. the patentee or an opponent. The {{oral proceedings}} are held before the <b>Opposition</b> <b>Division</b> itself. They are held in Munich, the Hague or Berlin, and are public unless very particular circumstances apply. This contrasts with oral proceedings held before an Examining Division, which are not public. The list of public oral proceedings in opposition before the EPO is available on its web site. The right to oral proceedings is a specific and codified part of the procedural right to be heard. A decision is often taken at the end of the oral proceedings.|$|E

25|$|During first {{instance}} proceedings, {{a decision on}} apportionment of costs forms part of the main decision of the <b>Opposition</b> <b>Division.</b> The main decision however only deals with the obligation on the party or parties concerned to bear costs (apportionment), whereas the actual amounts to be paid by one party to another are dealt with in another decision, namely a decision on the award (fixing) of costs. A decision on the award of costs is taken only after a decision apportioning the costs has been taken and if a request is submitted to that effect. When a Board of Appeal has to rule on an apportionment of costs, both the apportionment of costs and the fixing of costs to be apportioned are dealt with in a single decision.|$|E

The patent proprietor is master of its own patent in {{that the decision to}} amend or not, and how to amend the patent, is a decision of the patent proprietor alone (although the <b>Opposition</b> <b>Division</b> or the opponent may apply pressure to have amendments made). The patent, however, may not be amended in such a manner that the amendment would lead to an extension of the protection conferred by the patent.|$|E
