5000|$|The best-known {{series of}} out-takes {{consists}} of three takes for the [...] "French champagne" [...] advert. In the first, an off-screen voice yells [...] "Action", but Welles does not react for ten seconds. [...] "Action Orson, please", the <b>offscreen</b> <b>voice</b> says after a pause. [...] "He doesn't do anything?", asks Welles, referring to the actor holding the bottle of unpoured champagne.|$|E
5000|$|Jungle Patrol had {{its world}} premiere on September 24, 1948 at a {{national}} convention of the Air Force Association, held at the Hotel Commodore in New York. Reviewers commented on the film's [...] "unusual, and economical, use of <b>offscreen</b> <b>voices,</b> heard on a radio intercom, to depict all of the battle sequences." ...|$|R
5000|$|The special is {{hosted by}} an <b>offscreen</b> narrator (<b>voiced</b> by Hal Douglas) and the Magic Mirror (using re-edited vintage {{footage of the}} late Hans Conried) which {{incorporates}} segments from both [...] "Disney's Halloween Treat" [...] (1982) and [...] "Disney's Greatest Villains" [...] (1977) episodes featuring classic short cartoons and excerpts of various villains from Disney feature films. The opening and closing credits feature footage of the 1929 Silly Symphony short [...] "The Skeleton Dance", as did [...] "Disney's Halloween Treat", but the coloring on the skeletons has been changed to green, orange, and dark green. The special was rebroadcast during October for the following years on ABC and The Disney Channel until the late 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|Tyler {{began to}} work more and more <b>offscreen</b> as a <b>voice</b> artist, {{appearing}} in several cartoons and narrating vinyl recordings of Disney classics like Bambi and Babes in Toyland. She provided the voice of an amorous squirrel {{who falls in love}} with the young King Arthur (while he {{is in the form of}} a male squirrel) in The Sword in the Stone. She sang the voices of several barnyard animals in the [...] "Jolly Holiday" [...] sequence of Mary Poppins.|$|R
50|$|The video {{opens with}} an {{apparently}} scripted interview between Vayner and an <b>offscreen</b> <b>voice,</b> {{which consists of}} a single question, to which Vayner gives a lengthy response. Using considerable amounts of business jargon, Vayner praises himself and shares his various insights on success, talent, and overcoming adversity. Interspliced with the interview are clips of Vayner performing various feats, including bench pressing, skiing, playing tennis, ballroom dancing, and karate-chopping a stack of bricks. The video ends with a dedication to Radomir Kovačević and a credits sequence.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second and}} third takes consist of Welles {{beginning}} his monologue with a heavily slurred, [...] "Mwaaaah, the French! Champagne has already been celebrated for its excellence. There is a California champagne by Paul Masson, inspired by that same French excellence. It's fermented in the bottle, and like the best French champagnes, it's vintage-dated, so Paul Masson's superb...", before being interrupted by an <b>offscreen</b> <b>voice</b> shouting [...] "Cut!" [...] Throughout the takes, Welles appears to be having trouble remaining upright, clearly propping himself up on the table while tapping his fingers impatiently, {{and several of the}} extras are visibly having difficulty in not laughing.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{begins with}} the opening credits of a typical Star Wars fanfilm {{entitled}} [...] "Bond of the Force". Gregory (Abe Peterka) plays Jacen Solo, and Jennifer (Rebecca Peterka) plays the <b>offscreen</b> <b>voice</b> of Jaina Solo. Jacen is on a forest planet searching for Anakin Solo, but only encountering a Sith Lord named Darth Katai, played by Zarth (Justin Whitlock). The two begin to duel, {{and it is an}} intense battle...until Greg misses his cue, incurring the wrath of writer-director Tom [...] "Servo" [...] Harrison (Chris Hanel). Tom gets into a fight with his friends, and they walk out on him. After a monologue based on High Fidelity, with Star Wars in the place of rock music, Tom reflects back a few months to the genesis of the fanfilm project.|$|E
50|$|He then {{directed}} {{and made his}} first <b>offscreen</b> <b>voice</b> performance as a bandleader in One More Time (1970), which starred Sammy Davis Jr. (a friend of Lewis) and also produced, {{directed and}} starred in Which Way to the Front? (1970). He would then make and star in the unreleased The Day the Clown Cried (1972), a drama set in a Nazi concentration camp. Lewis rarely discusses the film, but once suggested that litigation over post-production finances prevented the film's completion and release. However, he admitted during his book tour for Dean and Me that a major factor for the film's burial {{is that he is}} not proud of the effort. In 1973, Lewis was a guest on The Dick Cavett Show, then appeared on Celebrity Sportsman in 1974. Lewis appeared in a revival of Hellzapoppin' with Lynn Redgrave in 1976, but it closed on the road before reaching Broadway. In 1979, Lewis guest hosted (as ringmaster) in Circus of the Stars.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore the {{cinematic}} representation of memory, trauma and {{identity in the}} autobiographical documentary, with reference to my film The Border Crossing. I utilise and locate my own experience inside questions {{about the use of}} cinematic language in the representation of memory, trauma, and identity. Alisa Lebow (2008) asks: “do we call up our cultural ghosts, or do they call on us? Is not the latter likely… where we are interpolated into the body of (cultural) knowledge we think of as our (contested) self?” The Border Crossing is set in the Basque country where a young woman reconstructs my self of 40 years ago. She wanders through streets {{on both sides of the}} Spanish/French border towards a violent fate, while an unnamed man drives in the rain at night. Interweaved are narratives of Aitziber, a Basque nationalist, tortured by the Spanish Guardia Civil, and Maria, a photographer, whose niece died in a car she was driving, and whose narratives of the present and past, include references to history. My <b>offscreen</b> <b>voice</b> reflects on the past and present and difficulties encountered in making this film and the young woman’s off-screen voice interacts with mine, as she recounts the story of the journey. This creates a discourse around the cinematic representation of subjectivities towards a metaphorical representation of past and present. It allows the camera and microphone to record an impressionistic landscape of sound and image to build a mosaic of exterior space that merges with an imagined space of the past to occupy the fertile space between documentary and fiction...|$|E
