40|$|Partial {{government}} <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> private financing can be {{an effective}} tool for maintaining public-private partnerships. Loan guarantees that cover {{some or all of the}} risk of repayment are frequently used by governments to pursue policy objectives–supporting priority infrastructure projects or corporations in financial distress. Studies show that guarantees are extremely valuable–the value <b>of</b> a <b>guarantee</b> increases with the risk of the underlying asset or credit, the size of the investment, and the time to maturity. The flip side <b>of</b> a <b>guarantee’s</b> value to a lender is a cost to the Government. Such a cost is not explicit, but is nevertheless real. To the extent, these liabilities have a subsidy component, careful risk sharing, valuation, and accounting mechanisms are important. This paper describes methods <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> valuation, reports estimates <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> values in different settings, and summarizes methods <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> accounting and their implications. While the old method recorded guarantees only when a default occurred, new methods seek to anticipate losses, create reserves, and channel funds through transparent accounts to ensure that costs <b>of</b> <b>guarantees</b> are evident to decision makers.
