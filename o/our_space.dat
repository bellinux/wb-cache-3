Anderson, who {{perceived}} a likeness to fellow American actor Paul Newman, cast Thinnes as the male lead after viewing his performance in the television series The Invaders (1967–68). In the Andersons' draft script, Ross's first name is Stewart, and he {{is said to have been}} the first man to walk on Mars. In a 2008 interview, Thinnes said, [...] "I thought [...] was an interesting premise, although now we know that there isn't another planet on the other side of the Sun, through <b>our</b> <b>space</b> exploration and telescopic abilities. But at that time it was conceivable, and it could have been scary." [...] To conform to the script's characterisation of Ross, and to the detriment of his respiratory health, Thinnes ended up smoking many packets' worth of cigarettes in the course of the production. Reporting on Thinnes' intention to demand a non-smoking clause in his next film contract, in September 1969 Australian newspaper The Age stated, [...] "He smokes about two packets a day, but the perpetual lighting up of new cigarettes for continuity purposes was too much." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} family of mixed finite element spaces for second order {{elliptic}} equations in two and three <b>space</b> dimensions. <b>Our</b> <b>spaces</b> approximate the vector flux by a continuous function. <b>Our</b> <b>spaces</b> generalize certain spaces used for approximation of Stokes problems. The finite element method incorporates projections of the Dirichlet data and certain low order terms. The method is locally conservative on the average. Suboptimal convergence is proven and demonstrated numerically. The key result is to construct a flux π-projection operator that is bounded in the Sobolev space H 1, preserves a projection of the divergence, and approximates optimally. Moreover, the corresponding Raviart–Thomas flux preserving π-projection operator is an L 2 -projection when restricted to this family of spaces...|$|R

Over 150 radio stations participated in broadcasting the band's new daily material, along with MTV, VH1, and digital music retailers like iTunes, as well as Cell phone companies.
