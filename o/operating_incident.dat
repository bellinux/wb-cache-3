5000|$|On {{multiple}} unit trains, the guard uses a buzzer code {{to communicate with}} the driver. Once the doors have closed and platform duties are complete, the guard informs the driver by sending the signal for [...] "ready to start", which is two rings (hence [...] "ding-ding"). There was a debate whether guards should only give the [...] "ready to start" [...] or station staff the [...] "right away" [...] signal if the platform starting signal was clear. The British Railways Board refused to change the rules, saying that the driver alone should have the responsibility to comply with signals. Initially the Railway Inspectorate agreed, for example in the report on the early example at Woolwich Arsenal in 1948. However, accidents in the 1970s culminating in seven people being killed at Paisley Gilmour Street in 1979 caused the rules to be changed in 1980, with the effect that giving the signal to [...] "close doors", [...] "ready to start" [...] or [...] "right away" [...] whilst the starting signal is at danger now constitutes an <b>operating</b> <b>incident.</b>|$|E

50|$|Environmental {{concerns}} - These can {{generally be}} divided into concerns for marine life (primarily due to the speed of travel, which, although slower than Seaflite ferries which <b>operated</b> without <b>incident</b> in the 1970s, critics cited as unnecessarily high and dangerous to whales, dolphins, turtles and other animals). Concern for the environmental impacts were threatened by the virtually unrestricted inter-island transport of vehicles, particularly by O'ahu residents engaged in recreational activities. The unrestricted inter-island transport of vehicles also threatened the spread of invasive species between islands. The eggs of a coqui frog, an invasive pest on the big island, can travel through mud splashed underneath vehicles.

We model the system for continuous and pulsed light sources, both of which are important for quantum metrology and quantum key distribution applications. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Plasmonics is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most promising candidates for implementing the next generation of ultrafast and ultracompact photonic circuits. Considerable effort has been made to scale down individual plasmonic components into the nanometer regime. However, a compact plasmonic source that can efficiently generate surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and deliver SPPs to the region of interest is yet to be realized. Here, bridging the optical antenna theory and the recently developed concept of metamaterials, we demonstrate a subwavelength, highly efficient plasmonic source for directional generation of SPPs. The designed device consists of two nanomagnetic resonators with detuned resonant frequencies. At the <b>operating</b> wavelength, <b>incident</b> photons can be efficiently channeled into SPP waves modulated by the electric field polarization. By tailoring the relative phase at resonance and the separation between the two nanoresonators, SPPs can be steered to predominantly propagate along one specific direction. This novel magnetic nanoantenna paves a new way to manipulate photons in the near-field, and also could be useful for SPP-based nonlinear applications, active modulations, and wireless optical communications...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modified loudspeaker source for decentralized feedback cavity control {{in a double}} panel structure to reduce the noise transmission. The double panel structure consists of two panels with air in between and offers the advantages of low weight, low sound transmission at high frequencies, and thermal insulation. The main issues of the double panel structure are the resonance of the cavity and the high noise transmission at low frequencies. Many papers have discussed applying active structural acoustic control to the panels or active noise control to the cavity. In our previous study, we considered the resonance of the panels and the cavity simultaneously and numerically compared various decentralized structural and cavity feedback control strategies basing on identical control stability margins. Cavity control by loudspeakers, which are modified to <b>operate</b> as <b>incident</b> pressure sources, was found toprovide the largest noise reduction. The incident pressure source loudspeaker can be realized by using a dynamic loudspeaker, a microphone, and a velocity sensor with a feedforward controller. In this paper, experimental results of a one dimensional realization with a feedforward controller are presented. 1...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{experimental}} {{investigations of the}} performance of a solar air collector with latent heat thermal storage integrated with the solarabsorber. The main purpose of heat storage in solar thermal systems is to store heat when the supply of solar heat exceeds demand and release it when otherwise. A number of heat storage materials can be used for this purpose; the phase change materials among them. Short-term latent heat thermal storage integrated with the solar absorber can stabilize the air temperature at the outlet of the collector on cloudy days when solar radiation intensity incident on a solar collector fluctuates significantly. Two experimental front-and-back pass solar air collectors of the same dimensions have been built for the experimental investigations. One collector had a “conventional” solar absorber made of a metal sheet while the solar absorber of the other collector consisted of containers filled with organic phase change material. The experimental collectors were positioned side by side during the investigations to ensure the same <b>operating</b> conditions (<b>incident</b> solar radiation, outdoor temperature) ...|$|R

5|$|The 1928 {{accident}} inquiry did not attach {{blame to}} the Southern Railway for track maintenance or locomotive performance issues, {{and noted that}} the prototype had run for eight years over the same stretch of line without complaint.

The management of the Southern Railway realised that to have any success in operating the Kclass tanks on {{other parts of the}} network, vast stretches of track would require upgrading. With the prospect of storing 20 locomotives whilst the necessary upgrading took place, the management recommended the class be fully withdrawn from service. To recoup the expense of constructing the engines, Maunsell was given permission to rebuild them to the new SR Uclass 2-6-0 tender engine design in 1928. This decision also reduced the adverse publicity generated by the accident.
