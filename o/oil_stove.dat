2500|$|The {{match against}} Nottingham Forest was {{played at the}} Antelope Ground on 2 February 1895. On {{the day of the}} match, the pitch was covered with three inches (76mm) of snow.

40|$|Background: In the {{aftermath}} of the Great East Japan Earthquake, most of the areas in Yamagata prefecture experienced a serious power failure lasting for approximately 24 hours. A number of households were subsequently poisoned with carbon monoxide (CO) due to various causes. In this study, we conducted a survey of CO poisoning during the disaster. Methods: A questionnaire regarding CO poisoning associated with the disaster was sent to 37 emergency hospitals in Yamagata prefecture. Results: A total of 51 patients were treated for unintentional CO poisoning in 7 hospitals (hyperbaric oxygen chambers were present in 3 of the hospitals). The patients (18 men, 33 women) ranged in age from 0 to 90 years. The source of CO exposure was charcoal briquettes (23 cases; 45 %), gasoline-powered electric generators (18 cases; 35 %), electric generators together with <b>oil</b> <b>stoves</b> (8 cases; 16 %), <b>oil</b> <b>stoves</b> (1 cases; 2 %), and automobile exhaust (1 cases; 2 %). Blood carboxyhemoglobin levels ranged from 0. 5 % to 41. 6 % in 49 cases. Of these, 41 patients were treated by normobaric oxygen therapy, while one was intubated for artificial respiration. Additionally, 5 patients (10 %) were treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and 3 patients (6 %) experienced delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae. Conclusion: CO sources included gasoline-powered electric generators and charcoal briquettes during the disaster. Storm-related CO poisoning is well recognized as a disaster-associated accident in the United States, but not in Japan. We emphasize that public education is needed to make people aware of the dangers of CO poisoning after a disaster. In addition, a pulse CO-oximeter should be set up in hospitals. ...|$|R

50|$|By the mid-1950s, {{dramatic}} changes had occurred for the Canadian Inuit, which lasted {{well into the}} 1960s. There were differences among the regions of Nunavut, such as the Qikiqtaaluk (Baffin), Kivalliq or Kitikmeot. The common characteristic was the extensive change from the nomadic to the sedentary way of living. Inuit left their camps and moved into settlements with permanent buildings. The wooden building replaced the igloo, qarmaq and tents originally made from hide. Since then, the Inuit have lived in residential buildings prefabricated {{in the south of}} Canada and - because of permafrost - built on stilts. These buildings are heated with <b>oil</b> <b>stoves</b> (every building has a holding tank for heating oil). Fresh water is delivered by tankers, and sewage is brought away the same way. The buildings contain kitchens with electric range, sink, and freezer; a bathroom with shower and/or bathtub, and flushing toilet; washers and dryers have become common. Like other westerners, many households keep their TV sets on almost 24 hours a day. The people use fax machines and e-mail for correspondence.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 Due {{to their}} remote {{locations}} and small populations, many remote villages in Alaska generate electricity with microgrids that employ diesel-electric generators for their {{primary source of}} power, and supplement this production with wind turbines. In such communities, it is economically advantageous to minimize fuel consumption by shifting {{as much of the}} village's energy demands to the wind system as is feasible. When wind turbines produce in excess of the demand, it is possible to use the excess electricity to power resistance heaters to heat water in tanks or masonry. The heat is then stored {{so that it can be}} used immediately or in the future to meet the village's heating demand. This is called electrothermal heating (ETH). The goal of this research work is to use MATLAB/Simulink� to model heating scenarios employing masonry electrothermal heaters to investigate how excess electricity from wind can be used for immediate heating needs and storage. The results demonstrate reduced heating oil consumption using electrothermal heating and increased storage potential in conjunction with <b>oil</b> <b>stoves...</b>|$|R
