Bergman informed Scheele that the saltpeter he had purchased from Scheele's employer, after long heating, produced red vapors (now known to be nitrogen dioxide) when it {{came into contact with}} acetic acid. Scheele's quick explanation was that the saltpeter had absorbed phlogiston with the heat (had been reduced to nitrite, in modern terms) and gave <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> phlogisticated gas as an active principle when combined with an acid (even a weak acid).|$|E
25|$|The {{ceremonial}} {{opening of}} the extension took place on Whit Saturday 14 May 1932 when 700 day-trippers made the journey to Allhallows on SECR R1 Class 0-4-4T No. 380, a special train laid on from London. The first passenger trains ran on the following bank holiday Monday, 16 May, with local trains starting from and returning to Gravesend Central. Cheap day return tickets from Charing Cross were offered at 5s 3d - the cheapest ticket to a Kentish seaside resort. To coincide with the {{opening of the}} new connection, other parts of the line were upgraded. At Stoke Junction, where the line to Allhallows branched <b>off,</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> halt was opened on 17 July 1932. At Cliffe and Sharnal Street, platforms were constructed, whilst at Uralite, High Halstow, Beluncle and Middle Stoke halts, concrete platforms replaced the timber ones.|$|E
25|$|After Australia kicked <b>off,</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> Zealand {{error in}} {{the first set of}} the game led to an early {{opportunity}} and field position for Australia, and the penalty was kicked by Johnathan Thurston to open the scoring to 2–0. The Kiwis suffered an early blow when after just one touch of the ball, Roger Tuivasa-Sheck had a recurrence of an ankle injury that forced him from the field after just 8 minutes with second rower Alex Glenn his replacement, forcing a re-shuffle with Simon Mannering moving to the centres and Dean Whare to the wing. Australia weren't without their problems though as soon after Jarryd Hayne went down with an apparent concussion after colliding with the hip of Simon Mannering while tackling the Kiwi captain, though the Kangaroos centre would remain on the field. Further play from the Kiwis brought them into the Australian half of the field, and a holding penalty then given by the Australians was kicked by Shaun Johnson to level the score to 2–2 at the 16 minute mark. Despite Old Trafford having an in-goal area of just 4.1m, Australia were able to force a line drop-out.|$|E

500|$|In {{an early}} {{account of what}} may be Fernando de Noronha, purportedly based on a voyage by Amerigo Vespucci in 1503, the island was said to be {{inhabited}} by [...] "lizards with two tails", which is thought be a reference to the Noronha skink. The tail is long and fragile, and it breaks easily, like that of many skinks and other lizards, following which it may regenerate. However, when it does not completely break <b>off,</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> tail may nevertheless grow out of the broken part, so that the tail appears forked.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} he had kicked <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> genre in Malayalam—family thriller, a genre which {{combines}} {{the elements of a}} family drama and thriller, Jeethu replied, [...] "I still believe it belongs to the genre 'drama', not a thriller." [...] He also stated in another interview, [...] "We usually brand a film as a thriller, simply because there is some mystery in the narrative or the story unfolds through an investigation. But I don't subscribe to this. Although there are some twists in the tale and some suspense as well, Drishyam is essentially the story of a family." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{very large}} (375 accessions) {{molecular}} analysis by Zonneveld (2008) utilising nuclear DNA content sought to reduce {{some of the}} paraphyly identified by Graham and Barrett. This led to a revision of the sectional structure, shifting some species between sections, eliminating one section and creating two new ones. In subgenus Hermione, Aurelia was merged with Tazettae. In subgenus Narcissus section Jonquillae subsection Juncifolii was elevated to sectional rank, thus resolving the paraphyly in this section observed by Graham and Barrett in Clade II due to this anomalous subsection, the remaining species being in subsection Jonquillae, which was monophyletic. The relatively large section [...] Pseudonarcissi [...] was divided by splitting <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> section, Nevadensis (species from southern Spain) leaving species from France, northern Spain and Portugal in the parent section. At the same time Fernández-Casas (2008) proposed a new monotypic section Angustini to accommodate Narcissus deficiens, placing it within subgenus Hermione.|$|E
500|$|The {{machines}} at Dorset Garden {{and several of}} the most flamboyant production concepts realised through them were strongly influenced by the French opera and tragédie en machines. Paris was home to the most elaborate visual and musical stage productions in Europe, and Betterton travelled to Paris in the summer of 1671 to learn from the sensation of the season, the comédie-ballet Psyché by Molière, Corneille, and Quinault, to music by Lully. [...] "For several things concerning the decoration of the play, I am obliged to the French", acknowledged Thomas Shadwell in the introduction to his own Psyche in 1674. Even more directly influential were the French operatic visits to London, which sparked <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> interest in opera proper in London audiences. In a brilliant move, the King's Company, all but bankrupt after the crushing blow of the fire in Bridges Street, invited the French musician Robert Cambert to perform his opera Ariadne {{as one of the first}} productions at their new playhouse in Drury Lane. The Duke's Company responded to the visual gorgeousness of this guest appearance with a Shakespearean extravaganza at Dorset Garden: Shadwell's adaptation of Davenant's and Dryden's version of Shakespeare's Tempest, a piece designed to show off the new machinery: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Collides {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Ethan Ladder, and filmed {{on a beach in}} Malibu, California. [...] The treatment for the video was described as [...] "a beautiful cinematic piece that will showcase the natural beauty of Leona Lewis. It will be inviting, sexy, and organic. It will be a moving fashion spread. It’s about finding the beauty in the subtleties of life. We are looking for beautiful men and women to help set the tone for this video. These people need to match Leona’s vibe and {{need to be able to}} have fun." [...] It was also noted that models applying to be in the video should have an Abercrombie & Fitch style about them, and that [...] "small tattoos" [...] were acceptable. For the most part of the video, Lewis is featured on a beach in a variety of different settings, such as sitting in an old cabriolet car, in which she is surrounded by her friends. Sitting in the car, Lewis wears a polka dot bikini top. Other scenes include Lewis standing in the shallow part of the ocean by herself, as well as sitting around a fire on the beach. As the video progresses, it changes from daytime to nighttime. Ryan Love of Digital Spy praised the video, saying [...] " [...] sees Lewis show <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> look while chilling with friends throughout the day and into the night." [...] Robbie Daw for Idolator compared the [...] "party in the sand imagery" [...] to Katy Perry's music video for [...] "Teenage Dream".|$|E
