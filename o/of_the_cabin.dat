5|$|In June 1956 {{some more}} {{wreckage}} from G-ALYP was accidentally trawled up {{from an area}} about 15 miles south of where the original wreckage had been found. This wreckage was from the starboard side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> just above the three front windows. Subsequent examination at Farnborough suggested that the primary failure was probably near to this area {{rather than at the}} rear automatic direction finding window on the roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> as had been previously thought. These findings were kept secret until the details were published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{review board}} {{determined}} that the electrical power momentarily failed at 23:30:55 GMT, and found evidence of several electric arcs in the interior equipment. They were unable to identify conclusively a single ignition source. They {{determined that the}} fire most likely started near {{the floor in the}} lower left section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> close to the Environmental Control Unit. It spread from the left wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> to the right, with the floor being affected only briefly.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{is invited}} to the White House for lunch with the President. However, Goldfinger hijacks the plane {{carrying}} Bond there. In a struggle for Goldfinger's revolver, the gun fires, shooting out a window, creating an explosive decompression. Goldfinger is blown out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> through the ruptured window. With the plane out of control, Bond rescues Galore and they parachute safely from the aircraft before it crashes into the ocean.|$|E

50|$|Apparently the Mobley family {{occupied}} two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins.</b> After <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> {{their small}} child {{they moved to}} Ogden, Kansas, and the site remained abandoned until fall 1857. A family had received permission to occupy Buchanan through the winter and left sometime after <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> 1857. By March 1859 the site was again occupied and remained so until at least spring 1860. The site was gradually abandoned and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> may have been moved away. After that Buchanan was not again occupied.|$|R
50|$|Currently, the 790 {{passenger}} vessel has 397 passenger cabins (292 outside, 105 inside), all equipped with televisions, safe boxes, hairdryers and additional amenities. Sixty-eight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> also have refrigerators.|$|R
5|$|By 1979, the Royal Navy {{had ordered}} 56 HAS1s and 21 HAS2s {{to meet the}} anti-submarine requirements, these were also {{configured}} for the secondary anti-ship role. The Westland Sea King was updated and adapted for numerous roles, subsequent variants include the HAS2, HAS5 and HAS6. Changes from initial production aircraft included an expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> and upgraded engines.|$|E
5|$|Keč hijacked the {{aircraft}} with 122 passengers and {{a crew of}} six in mid-air after leaving Bardufoss. The aircraft landed as scheduled at Bodø, where all women, children and seniors were let off, along with two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> crew. The aircraft then departed Bodø with 77 passengers and a crew of four. It was diverted to Gardermoen, where Keč made his demands. He surrendered at about 21:00, seven hours after take-off from Bardufoss, after some of his demands had been met. He was sentenced to four years prison for the incident.|$|E
5|$|Prior to impact, {{passengers}} did {{not assume}} the brace position. When the airplane came to rest, {{many of the}} passengers in the forward portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> were upside down, others, who were upright were submerged in water over their heads. Some passengers tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still buckled, and other passengers had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following the accident, passengers reported fires in the forward left and aft portions of the airplane, including many small fires on the water. Passengers stated that they escaped through large holes in the cabin. The lead flight attendant and first officer escaped {{through a hole in}} the cabin floor near the flight attendant’s position. Several passengers reported assisting others out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> and into the knee-deep water. Many of them walked in the water to the dike, climbed up the wall and over an embankment, and slid down a steep hill to the runway. Others were assisted out of the water by ground personnel.|$|E
50|$|First two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> under <b>the</b> {{main deck}} can be dismantled. This will clear another four beds for the cadets {{as well as}} double <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dining room. This space could then be used for various events, parties or lectures.|$|R
500|$|In late June 1847, members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mormon Battalion under General Steven Kearny {{buried the}} human remains, and {{partially}} burned two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins.</b> <b>The</b> few who ventured over the {{pass in the}} next few years found bones, other artifacts, and <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> used by <b>the</b> Reed and Graves families. In 1891, a cache of money was found buried by the lake. [...] It had probably been stored by Mrs. Graves, who hastily hid it when she left with the second relief so that she could return for it later.|$|R
50|$|Cassina Garden Club began {{meeting in}} these cabins in 1932 and was deeded the {{property}} in 1950. As owner of this beautiful historic site, the Cassina Garden Club has carefully restored and preserved <b>the</b> integrity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> and displays many artifact and graphical histories.|$|R
5|$|According to the Board, Grissom {{suffered}} severe third degree {{burns on}} over one-third {{of his body}} and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on almost half of his body and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over {{almost a quarter of}} his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. The autopsy report confirmed that the primary cause of death for all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem. Asphyxiation happened after the fire melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{the climactic}} tanker chase, the {{producers}} used an entire {{section of a}} highway near Mexicali, which had been closed for safety reasons. Sixteen eighteen-wheeler tankers were used, some with modifications made by manufacturer Kenworth {{at the request of}} driving stunts arranger Rémy Julienne. Most were given improvements to their engines to run faster, while one model had an extra steering wheel on the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> so a hidden stuntman could drive while Carey Lowell was in the front and another received extra suspension on its back so it could lift its front wheels. Although a rig was constructed to help a rig tilt onto its side, it was not necessary as Julienne was able to pull off the stunt without the aid of camera trickery.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident Review Board to {{determine}} the cause of the fire, and both houses of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. The ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b> A failure to identify the test as hazardous (because the rocket was unfueled) led to the rescue being hampered by poor emergency preparedness.|$|E
2500|$|Archaeology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site {{shows that}} <b>the</b> rooms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slave <b>cabins</b> were much larger in the 1770s {{than in the}} 1790s. Researchers {{disagree}} as to whether this indicates that more slaves were crowded into a smaller spaces, or that fewer people lived in the smaller spaces. [...] Earlier slave houses had a two-room plan, one family per room, with a single, shared doorway to the outside. But from the 1790s on, all rooms/families had independent doorways. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> are free-standing, single-room structures.|$|R

50|$|In 1860 Clifton {{was moved}} {{just to the}} north and ended up just inside Washington County, Kansas. A number of log cabins were built there by the settlers, so they could take refuge there during Indian uprisings. In 1861 and 1862 school was held in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Doctor enters Bennett's room, {{and finds}} {{things are not}} as they seem. The {{supposedly}} crippled Bennett is missing, and a tape recorder hides his absence. He finds a trap door in the floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> and follows it to a temple carved from rock where he unmasks Koquillion as Bennett. Bennett reveals he killed a crewmember on board the ship and was arrested, but the ship crashed before the crime could be radioed to Earth. It was he who killed the crash survivors and the natives of Dido to cover his crime. He has been using the Koquillion alias so that Vicki would back up his story, and had hoped the planet would be destroyed when his version of events was given. Just as Bennett is about to kill the Doctor, two surviving native Didonians arrive and force Bennett to his death over a ledge. They then stop the signal to prevent the Rescue Ship reaching their planet. With no living family and nothing left for her on Dido, Vicki is welcomed aboard the TARDIS.|$|E
5|$|The first {{target of}} the WSGA was Nate Champion, {{who was at the}} KC Ranch (also known as Kaycee) at that time. They were tasked to perform the {{assassination}} that others had failed to carry out five months before. The group traveled to the ranch late Friday, April 8, 1892, quietly surrounded the buildings, and waited for daybreak. Three men besides Champion were at the KC. Two men who were evidently going to spend the night on their way through were captured as they emerged from the cabin early that morning to collect water at the nearby Powder River, while the third, Nick Ray, was shot while standing inside the doorway <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b> As the gunmen opened fire on the cabin, Champion grabbed the mortally wounded Nick Ray back to the cabin. The latter died hours later, and Champion was left besieged inside the log cabin alone.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} serious {{injuries}} were multiple lower leg fractures and dislocations, spinal fractures, hip fractures, head injuries, and multiple lacerations and contusions. The NTSB investigators found severe {{damage on the}} floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> leading many of the passengers' seats to fracture where the legs met the floor track. This fracturing permitted many of the seats to come loose during the impact and aggravated the passengers' injuries. The report posits that the passengers' legs hit the lower seat frames in front of them. At the same time, the seats collapsed and twisted downward and to the left, likely causing hip and spinal fractures. As the impact progressed, the seats, now separated, flung passengers forward into each other as well as into other wreckage, causing head injuries and lacerations. Passengers holding onto infants reported being unable to either prevent their children from being ejected from their grasp in the impact or locate {{their children in the}} darkness afterward. The NTSB held that, had the children been in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved child seats, many injuries might have been mitigated. Rescuers remarked that some infants were found smiling or seemingly unharmed. The NTSB was unable to accurately chart where individual passengers were seated because Avianca only assigned seats to a few passengers and many who were assigned reported moving after takeoff.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby {{for a woman who}} has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will never die, as he watches his father row.|$|E
