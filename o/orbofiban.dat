METHODSPatients (n = 520) with ACS were randomized to <b>orbofiban</b> 30 mg, 40 mg or 50 mg twice daily or 50 mg once daily or placebo. Platelet activity was assessed in 175 patients by examining GPIIb/IIIa receptor conformation, expression of CD 63 antigen, and platelet aggregation. RESULTSPlasma concentrations of <b>orbofiban</b> at the highest dose (74 ± 6 ng/ml peak, 61 ± 5 ng/ml trough) exceeded the IC 50 for platelet aggregation to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (29 ± 6 ng/ml) and thrombin-activating peptide (61 ± 18 ng/ml). <b>Orbofiban</b> induced a conformational change in GPIIb/IIIa detected as the displacement of the monoclonal antibody mAb 2; such conformational changes have been linked to partial agonist activity. Consistent with this, platelet expression of CD 63 ex vivo was significantly increased at five time points during the study. In vitro, <b>orbofiban</b> increased platelet aggregation to a submaximal concentration of epinephrine (67 ± 19 % vs. 27 ± 9 %, n = 5) and increased thromboxane formation when the platelet GPIIb/IIIa were clustered using monoclonal antibodies to the receptor. CONCLUSIONSOrbofiban is both an antagonist and a partial agonist of platelet GPIIb/IIIa. At low concentrations of the drug, this partial agonist activity may enhance platelet aggregation. Along with suboptimal plasma drug levels, these findings may help explain the lack of efficacy seen with <b>orbofiban</b> in patients with ACS...|$|E
40|$|Background—Although {{intravenous}} glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are {{beneficial in}} patients with acute coronary syndromes, prolonged oral IIb/IIIa inhibition might provide an additional reduction in recurrent events. Methods and Results—Investigators at 888 hospitals in 29 countries enrolled 10 288 patients with acute coronary syndromes, which was defined as ischemic pain at rest within 72 hours of randomization, associated with positive cardiac markers, electrocardiographic changes, or prior cardiovascular disease. Patients received aspirin and were randomized to receive, {{for the duration of}} the trial, (1) 50 mg of <b>orbofiban</b> twice daily (50 / 50 group), (2) 50 mg of <b>orbofiban</b> twice daily for 30 days followed by 30 mg of <b>orbofiban</b> twice daily (50 / 30 group), or (3) a placebo. The primary composite end point was death, myocardial infarction, recurrent ischemia requiring rehospitalization, urgent revascularization, or stroke. The trial was terminated prematurely because of an unexpected increase in 30 -day mortality in the 50 / 30 <b>orbofiban</b> group. Mortality through 10 months was 3. 7 % for the placebo group versus 5. 1 % in the 50 / 30 group (P 50. 008) and 4. 5 % in the 50 / 50 group (P 50. 11). There were no differences in the primary end point (22. 9 %, 23. 1 %, and 22. 8 %, for the placebo, 50 / 30, and 50 / 50 groups, respectively). Major or severe bleeding (but not intracranial hemorrhage) was higher with orbofiban; it occurred in 2. 0 %, 3. 7 % (P 50. 0004), and 4. 5 % (P, 0. 0001) of patients, respectively. Exploratory subgroup analyses found that patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention had a lower mortality and a significant reduction in the composite end point (P 50. 001) with <b>orbofiban...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} non-peptide orally active RGD mimetic prodrug such as <b>Orbofiban,</b> Sibrafiban, SR 121566, Roxifiban and others {{entered into the}} {{clinical}} evaluation stage. Some of these agents were terminated and some are still in clinical trials. The present study examined the platelet GPIIb/IIIa binding profiles for the active form of Roxifiban, Sibrafiban, SR 121566 and <b>Orbofiban</b> using 3 H-Roxifiban active form (XV 459), 3 H-DMP 728, 125 I-Echistatin, and 125 I-Fibrinogen. Either DMP 728, <b>Orbofiban,</b> Sibrafiban, SR 121566 or Roxifiban active form {{as well as other}} RGD mimetic bind to the same binding site (s) on human platelets as evident from the competitive inhibition of binding of each other to human platelet. Additionally, Roxifiban active form competed with FITC labeled GPIIb/IIIa antagonist cyclic RGD peptidomimetic (XL 086) as demonstrated using confocal microscopy technique. Roxifiban active form (XV 459) demonstrated the highest potency in inhibiting 3 H-XV 459, 3 H-DMP 728, 125 I-Echistatin, and 125 I-Fibrinogen binding to human platelets as compared to the others. Structure activity relationship within the isoxazoline Roxifiban series showed that substituent at the α-carbon next to the carboxy terminal represents an exosite for the affinity binding to human platelets leading to slow platelet dissociation rate. These data indicated a distinct binding profile for Roxifiban (high affinity to both activated and resting platelets associated with a relatively slow Koff) as compared to others. These differences might determine the pharmacodynamics and pharmackokinetics of the different GPIIb/IIIa antagonists...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{hypothesized}} that elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) {{would be associated}} with adverse outcomes independent of serum creatinine (sCr) -based estimates of kidney function in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). BackgroundAlthough lower glomerular filtration rates (GFR) have prognostic significance among patients with ACS, estimates of GFR based on sCr may perform less accurately among patients with milder kidney dysfunction. In this population in particular, BUN, which can reflect increased proximal tubular reabsorption in addition to decreased GFR, may have independent prognostic value. MethodsData were drawn from 9, 420 patients with unstable coronary syndromes from <b>Orbofiban</b> in Patients With Unstable Coronary Syndromes-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (OPUS-TIMI) - 16, a trial that excluded patients with sCr > 1. 6 mg/dl or estimated creatinine clearance < 40 ml/min. ResultsPatients with elevated BUN were older, had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, and had higher heart rates, lower systolic blood pressures, and an abnormal Killip class more often on admission. In univariate analyses, as well as in stratified and multivariable analyses including sCr-based estimates of GFR as a covariate, a stepwise increase in mortality occurred with increasing BUN (multivariable hazard ratio with BUN 20 to 25 mg/dl 1. 9, 95 % confidence interval 1. 3 to 2. 6; with BUN ≥ 25 mg/dl 3. 2 [95 % confidence interval 2. 2 to 4. 7]) compared with BUN ≤ 20 mg/dl. A higher BUN was also associated with increased mortality among strata of troponin-I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and C-reactive protein concentrations. ConclusionsAmong patients with unstable coronary syndromes and predominantly normal or mildly reduced GFR, an elevated BUN is associated with increased mortality, independent of sCr-based estimates of GFR and other biomarkers...|$|E
40|$|As the {{glycoprotein}} GPIIb/IIIa receptor is {{the final}} common pathway in platelet aggregation, antagonists of this receptor cause a profound inhibition of aggregation induced by any agonist. The short-term efficacy and safety of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty was demonstrated with murine 7 E 3 Fab, but this antibody was immunogenic. Abciximab is a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal antibody that is less immunogenic. The first major trial with a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist was the EPIC trial with abciximab, which showed that abciximab reduced the ischemic complications of coronary balloon angioplasty and atherectomy in high-risk patients, but increased the risk of bleeding. Subsequent studies showed that using less concurrent heparin reduced bleeding. Abciximab also reduced the rate of revascularization. Further {{studies have shown that}} the benefits of abciximab extended to all patients undergoing angioplasty (EPILOG), including patients with unstable angina (CAPTURE) and acute myocardial infarction (RAPPORT). Clinical trials with eptifibatide and tirofiban have failed to demonstrate benefit, at the doses used, in angioplasty. Abciximab and eptifibatide, but not oral xemilofiban, improve the safety of the coronary stenting procedure. Shortterm intravenous treatment with lamifiban, eptifibatide or tirofiban is beneficial in acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, non-Q wave myocardial infarction). Orally active GPIIb/IIIa antagonists are being developed for use in acute coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction. However, no benefit has been shown with lefradafiban in acute coronary syndromes and sibrafiban and <b>orbofiban</b> are harmful. Eptifibatide, lamifiban and abciximab improve coronary patency in myocardial infarction, and long-term trials of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists are being conducted in acute myocardial infarction. Abciximab can cause thrombocytopenia, and all the GPIIb/IIIa antagonists increase the incidence of bleeding, but there is no excess of intracranial hemorrhage. (C) 2001 Prous Science.

40|$|Consistent {{levels of}} {{platelet}} inhibition {{are required to}} deliver effective antiplatelet therapy. Growing awareness that not all individuals respond comparably to aspirin {{has led to the}} concept of aspirin ‘resistance’ and prompted search for an means to confirm individual response. However, the term is misleading because there are many determinants of failure to respond to treatment. Aspirin’s primary pharmacological effect and that which is understood to prevent thrombosis is almost complete inactivation of platelet cyclooxygenase- 1 and thereby inhibition of thromboxane biosynthesis. In this thesis I report findings from a study of patients with cardiovascular disease taking aspirin, in which I apply point-of-care and laboratory assays with varying specificity for cyclooxygenase inhibition. I demonstrate weak correlation between aspirin assays, some of which measure cyclooxygenase inhibition and others that detect platelet reactivity despite cyclooxygenase inactivation. I identify supernatant thromboxane generation as a sensitive assay of aspirin response. I also demonstrate that low dose enteric-coated aspirin preparations fail to deliver an adequate dose to many patients. Heritable factors determine platelet reactivity to a greater extent that environmental factors and largely determine residual activity in the presence of cyclooxygenase inhibition. I demonstrate that haplotypic variation in the cyclooxygenase- 1 gene and a common splice variant in the gene that encodes the serotonin transporter modulate COX inhibition. I also identify a platelet G-protein (33 subunit splice variant that influences epinephrine-induced platelet activation via a non-COX dependent pathway. I demonstrate that the same variant increased bleeding in patients treated with the oral glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa antagonist <b>orbofiban</b> in the OPUS-TIMI 16 trial. Lastly I investigate the role of human growth arrest specific gene 6 in platelets. I take a molecular biology and in-silico analysis approach to characterising the gene and its transcriptional response elements. I also screen for genetic variants in its regulatory regions to assess their role in determining platelet reactivity...|$|E
