5|$|The {{victims of}} this {{poisoning}} were almost exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population cadmium exposures in other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>have</b> not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, although cadmium {{is a major factor}} in the itai-itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors. Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Union's Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive, which regulates hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the recent}} past, little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the interests of Third World countries.

As more countries have continued to become more developed, the interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>have</b> slowly started to shift. However, First World nations still have many more universities, professors, journals, and conferences, which has made it very difficult for Third World countries to gain legitimacy and respect with their new ideas and methods of looking at the world.|$|E

In contrast to the rarer species, the cave form of the Mexican tetra is easily bred in captivity and widely available to aquarists. This is the most studied cavefish species and likely also the most studied cave organism overall. As of 2006, only six other cavefish species have been bred in captivity, typically by scientists.|$|E
