2500|$|Larger {{vehicles}} {{can create}} visibility problems for other road users by obscuring {{their view of}} traffic lights, signs, and other vehicles on the road, plus the road itself. Depending on <b>the</b> design, drivers <b>of</b> some larger vehicles may themselves suffer from poor visibility {{to the side and}} the rear. Poor rearward vision has led to many [...] "backover deaths" [...] where vehicles have run over small children when backing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>driveways.</b> <b>The</b> problem <b>of</b> backover deaths has become so widespread that reversing cameras are being installed on some vehicles to improve rearward vision.|$|R

50|$|In 1950 Whiskey Bottom Road was straightened, widened, and Macadamized. By <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> {{transient}} traffic as well {{as local}} traffic from developments reached the point where residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> street facing homes could not safely turn into and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their <b>driveways.</b> <b>The</b> occasional auto accidents where vehicles struck houses became commonplace. Traffic surveys concluded that <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> accidents were from vehicles striking turning vehicles from behind. The traffic engineering departments of Anne Arundel and Howard Counties took two different approaches to the issue. In 1993 the Anne Arundel section adopted a road widening approach, taking eminent domain of properties and adding a shared center left-hand turn lane down <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road. This was partially funded by the pending Russett development as a condition of zoning approval. Howard County planned to follow suit in 2002 but opted to explore traffic calming after 98% of roadside residents petitioned against widening the road. A series of narrow choking islands, and roundabouts were placed along the roadway with <b>the</b> intention <b>of</b> physically restricting <b>the</b> maximum speed <b>of</b> a vehicle to the 30 mi/h km/h limit. Transient drivers have objected to the obstacles. Howard County engineers defend their usefulness in controlling reckless driving without the need for increased traffic patrols.|$|R
