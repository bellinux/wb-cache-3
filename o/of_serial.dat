40|$|An {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>serials</b> preferred and {{cited in}} various communications by the Indian oceanographers during 1963 to 1992 is presented. A shift in preference <b>of</b> <b>serials</b> from general sciences to oceanography (interdisciplinary) and to core subject in oceanography is noticed. The contributions to Indian serials showed a decrease. The {{implications of this}} trend are discussed. The rank list <b>of</b> <b>serials</b> cited by Indian oceanographers was correlated with the rank list <b>of</b> <b>serials</b> cited at international level. A negative correlation with a marginal difference of- 0. 214 is observed between these two rank lists. This difference is attributed to studies from different geographical reas in these two rank sets. Bradford graphs for all datasets, but one, showed typical Bradford-Leimkuhler curves with or without clear Groos droops. Further research is required to explain this exceptional curve. A country-wise analysis <b>of</b> the <b>serials</b> preferred as well as cited in communications give a clear picture on the shift {{during the period of}} study.

5|$|Gilligan {{wrote the}} episode after being {{inspired}} by stories <b>of</b> <b>serial</b> killers he {{read as a}} child. Other inspirations include the concept of thought-photographs, and common fears associated with dentist chairs. The episode received a generally positive reception, though critics criticized the plotline featuring Scully being kidnapped. Critical attention also expressed a positive opinion of how scary the episode was in nature. Guest actor Taylor Vince received positive reviews as the episode's antagonist.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 the constables <b>of</b> <b>Serial</b> 502 {{were awarded}} the Queen's Gallantry Medal, Blakelock posthumously.

5|$|More recent performances, led by {{conductors}} Pierre Boulez, Edo de Waart and Sixten Ehrling, {{have been}} acknowledged {{to show the}} music in a more positive light. Nevertheless, the overall reputation of the music remains mixed. Some critics, including composer John Adams, have remained critical {{of the work and}} considered Copland's use <b>of</b> <b>serial</b> techniques detrimental to his later music. Others, which include critics Michael Andrews and Peter Davis, have seen Connotations as proof of Copland's continued growth and inventiveness as a composer while not downplaying the work's melodic and harmonic harshness and potential difficulty overall for listeners.|$|E

5|$|The {{avionics}} software {{incorporates the}} concept of open architecture. Instead of the military-optimised Ada programming language, the software is written using the popular C++ programming language, enabling {{the use of the}} numerous civilian programmers available. The aircraft also includes a health and usage monitoring system, and automatic test equipment. The flight control system (FCS) comprises conventional controls with stability augmentation in the yaw and roll axis and a digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system in the pitch axis. The leading edge slats/flaps and trailing edge flaps are automatically adjusted during manoeuvring to increase turning performance. The FCS <b>of</b> <b>serial</b> production aircraft reportedly have a digital quadruplex (quad-redundant) FBW system in the pitch axis and a duplex (dual-redundant) FBW system in the roll and yaw axis.|$|E
5|$|Wong {{continued}} to be offered exotic supporting roles, playing indigenous native girls in two 1924 films. Filmed on location in the Territory of Alaska she portrayed an Eskimo in The Alaskan. She returned to Los Angeles to perform the part of Princess Tiger Lily in Peter Pan. Both films were shot by cinematographer James Wong Howe but Peter Pan was more successful; the hit of the Christmas season. The next year, Wong was singled out for critical praise in a manipulative Oriental vamp role in the film Forty Winks. Despite such favorable reviews, she became increasingly disappointed with her casting and began to seek other roads to success. In early 1925 she joined a group <b>of</b> <b>serial</b> stars {{on a tour of}} the vaudeville circuits; when the tour proved to be a failure, Wong and the rest of the group returned to Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Writer Vince Gilligan was {{inspired}} to write the episode based on Time-Life mail order books he read as a child discussing the lives <b>of</b> <b>serial</b> killers. One of the books featured mass murderer Howard Unruh. The episode was also inspired by Ted Serios, whose thought-photographs were mentioned by Fox Mulder in the episode. The use of the dentist chair where Schnauz sat his victims was included considering people's common fear of the dentist. Gilligan had written the role of Schnauz with Taylor Vince {{in mind when he}} saw him in the Adrian Lyne film Jacob's Ladder. Vince had been approached to be a guest star on the show in the first season but declined the role due to it being too small.|$|E
