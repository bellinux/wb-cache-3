5|$|As {{a form of}} express trust, {{charitable}} trusts {{are subject}} to certain formalities, {{as well as the}} requirements of the three certainties, when being created. These vary depending on whether the gift that creates the trust is given in life, given after death, or includes land. If the gift is given after death through a will, the will must comply with Section 9 of the Wills Act 1837, which requires that the will be in writing and signed by the testator (or somebody else present, at the testator's instruction), {{it is clear that the}} testator intended to give effect to the will, and the signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses. If these are all carried out, the will is a valid document, and the gift made as part of it can create a charitable trust. If the gift is of land and made during the donor's lifetime, it must comply with Section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, which requires that the agreement be a written document signed by the person giving it. If the gift is of personal property and made inter vivos, there are no formal requirements; it is enough that an <b>oral</b> <b>declaration</b> is made creating the trust. Once constituted properly, a charitable trust, like all express trusts, cannot be undone unless there is something allowing that within the trust instrument.|$|E
60|$|Now, many {{answers are}} {{being given to}} that {{question}} at the present time. We may take as the extremest opposite to the eternal marriage idea the proposal of Mr. Bernard Shaw, that marriage should be terminable at the instance of either party. You would give due and public notice that your marriage was at an end, {{and it would be}} at an end. This is marriage at its minimum, as the eternal indissoluble marriage is marriage at its maximum, and the only conceivable next step would be to have a marriage makeable by the <b>oral</b> <b>declaration</b> of both parties and terminable by the <b>oral</b> <b>declaration</b> of either, which would be, indeed, no marriage at all, but an encounter. You might marry a dozen times in that way in a day.... Somewhere between these extremes lies the marriage law of a civilised state. Let us, rather than working down from the eternal marriage of the religious idealists, work up from Mr. Shaw. The former course is, perhaps, inevitable for the legislator, but the latter is much more convenient for our discussion.|$|E

50|$|The House of Lords, {{by three}} to two, found that Vandervell was indeed liable to pay {{tax on the}} £245,000 of {{dividends}} given to the Royal College of Surgeons. The House of Lords held that the Law of Property Act 1925, section 53(1)(c), was not applicable to situations where a beneficiary directs his trustees, by way of his Saunders v Vautier right to do so, to transfer full legal and equitable ownership to someone else. The case is a proposition that an <b>oral</b> <b>declaration</b> to a bare trustee to transfer the trust property to a third party absolutely for his own benefit is a valid disposition. However, Vandervell had not successfully divested himself of ownership (legal and equitable) in the shares, since the Trust Company had an option to purchase the shares back from the RCS. If the settlor does not divest himself adequately as in Vanderwell v IRC a resulting trust would operate. The option to purchase a substantial fraction of the company for only £5000 was extremely valuable. As such, Vandervell was liable to pay surtax on the option.|$|E

The content of this article is based, fundamentally, in the results of an investigation made for a thesis of doctorate on the Salamanca University. This study was carried out using an ethnographic perspective of investigation, supported in the <b>oral</b> <b>declarations,</b> obtained through interviews, of members of this Movement. At a first moment, {{we are going to make}} a description of the historical evolution of this pedagogical movement, through its key moments. A second moment will be dedicated to the analysis of some singular dimensions of MEM, so that it allows an approach to his pedagogical characteristics. We emphasised the proposals of co-operated formation and the bet in a socio-centric model of education. We emphasised the construction of an own pedagogical culture that impregnates this movement of renovation. A last aspect of outstanding importance is the reflection tradition on the practices that this group cultivates. A third moment, as a synthesis, will be dedicated to the analysis of the contributions to pedagogy and the profession of professor by the MEM in this millennium end...|$|R
40|$|The first {{diplomatic}} missions from Dubrovnik to the Sublime Porte {{played an}} important role in forming the identity of their city. Ambassadors from Dubrovnik were empowered to represent their city during crucial moments in the Ottoman westward expansion. The success of their missions influenced the position the city had under new circumstances characterized by constant shifts in the balance of power. This essay is focused on <b>oral</b> <b>declarations</b> by Ragusan ambassadors, which can be seen as an attempt to define, describe, and typify the community they are authorized to represent. Although these statements were used primarily to achieve various pragmatic aims, at the same time they can be perceived as an expression of the qualities of the city-state. Their messages reflected their beliefs, traditions, and customs of their culture in correlation with the specific conditions in which they functioned. Their choices depended on assessments of their efficiency. However, sometimes their missions did not end with the desired outcome because their system of values did not correspond to that of an Islamic culture. Nevertheless, over time the initial confusion and concerns were eventually alleviated by the practical experience they acquired. An analysis of the verbal communication between Dubrovnik’s ambassadors and the Porte, from the establishment of formal diplomatic relations to the acceptance of a tributary relationship, facilitates an examination of changes in the way they expressed their identity through verbal arguments and how they manipulated said arguments–in other words, how they wielded propaganda and ideology. In that sense, this verbal communication by the ambassadors is viewed as performativity that not only conveys a message but actively participates in its construction...|$|R
40|$|PhDIn this thesis, {{the sources}} {{considered}} {{suitable for the}} study of inheritance were reviewed, and a theoretical model for a system of customary inheritance was developed. The study divides into two part seach relating either to the sources or to the model. The first part of the thesis re-evaluates the traditional divisions of sources {{for the study of}} inheritance and devises new divisions for use in this study. The second part of the thesis uses these new divisions in developing a model for the operation of inheritance and discusses the role of these sources in relation to that model. In place of the traditional division of source material for the study of inheritance, a system was devised consisting of two broad areas: Wills and Additional Documents. The area of Wills was divided into the following headings: Written Wills, <b>Oral</b> <b>Declarations,</b> Category A, B, or C Lost Wills, and Grants made while Dying. Additional Documents included the following material: Reference to an Inheritance, Reference to Property Descent, and Documents relevant to the nature of wills. The merits and limitations of these sources were discussed with reference to their preservation whether as single sheet contemporary copies or in cartularies. The theoretical model for a system of customary inheritance is relatively simple. The relationship between that system and the sources alters the traditional perspective on those sources with the result that the evidence from written wills is seen as supplemental rather than central to the study of inheritance. From this new perspective, it becomes apparent that the property donated inside wills represents only a portion of a donor's total possessions and that in the operation of the customary inheritance system, male donees are preferred as the recipients of landed property...|$|R

30|$|While the United States {{has long}} had {{concerns}} about illegal immigration from Mexico, 5 the border was quite easy to cross for US residents. A driver’s license and an <b>oral</b> <b>declaration</b> of citizenship generally sufficed, {{and for those who}} lived in frontier cities, crossing the border to shop was little different from shopping in an adjacent suburb. 6 By {{the end of the twentieth}} century, the border had become quite “thin”, and the economies on each side of the border were becoming increasingly integrated. As noted by Thompson (2008), “…a common border culture…was helping to integrate northern Mexico with the southern US”. As a result Mexico’s northern border zone or “la frontera norte” has been an important contributor to Mexican growth. The six Mexican states that border the US capture a large and relatively prosperous part of Mexico. By 2013 the six states contained 17  % of Mexico’s population and produced 22.5  % of its GDP. They also exhibit relatively high human development indices and contain relatively fewer workers earning the minimum salary (Bringas Rábago 2005).|$|E

40|$|O presente estudo se dedica a determinadas prÃticas de escrita de um grupo de indivÃduos que conviviam no bairro Benfica, na cidade de Fortaleza, CearÃ, Brasil, no inÃcio dos anos 2000. Da vivÃncia desses indivÃduos, foram escritos, editados e distribuÃdos os fanzines PalavraDesordem (numa sÃrie de onze ediÃÃes) e Sarrabuio de TertÃlia (em trÃs ediÃÃes), alÃm de uma ediÃÃo da revista alternativa PindaÃba. Com o suporte do pensamento de autores como Nietzsche, Maffesoli, Foucault, Maingueneau e Larrosa, postula este estudo que as prÃticas implicadas nessa escritura, observadas no cenÃrio da pÃs-modernidade, podem ser interpretadas como uma experiÃncia pedagÃgica em que se reatualiza o mito de Dioniso, a fazer valer princÃpios de errÃncia e pluralidade nas sociedades contemporÃneas. A partir de alguns princÃpios e procedimentos da anÃlise do discurso, estes fanzines e a revista sÃo abordados, juntamente com depoimentos escritos e/ou orais concedidos pelos prÃprios indivÃduos em entrevistas semi-estruturadas. A anÃlise parte de categorias como ritos genÃticos, posicionamentos discursivos e formas de si associados Ã escritura em questÃo, em sua criaÃÃo e circulaÃÃo, e evidencia como a manifestaÃÃo do dionisÃaco se faz: a boemia, a indisciplina, o culto Ã vida em grupo, o elogio Ã embriaguez, o apelo ao riso, a crueldade Ã vista, o errÃdico (nas funÃÃes de autoria, nos cuidados de si e nas concepÃÃes de escrita) e a criaÃÃo (nos modos de fazer e na apropriaÃÃo de saberes). A tese conclui, assim, que tal escritura possibilita a constituiÃÃo desses indivÃduos em sujeitos da experiÃncia que, em Ãltima instÃncia, traduz-se como uma pedagogia da vida. The {{present study}} {{analyses}} determined practices of writing {{from a group}} of individuals who lived im Benfica district in the city of Fortaleza, CearÃ, Brazil, in early of the years 2000. From their living together, they wrote, edited and distributed the fanzines PalavraDesordem (in a series of eleven editions) and Sarrabuio de TertÃlia (in three editions), besides on edition of the alternative magazine PindaÃba. Having the support of thoughts from authors such as Nietzsche, Maffesoli, Foucault, Maingueneau and Larrosa, this study postulates that the practices implied in the writing of this discoursive community, observed in the scenary of post-modernity, may be interpreted as a pedagogical experience that re-modernize the myth of Dionyso, giving value to erroneous principles and plurality in the contemporary societies. The fanzines and the alternative magazine produced by the group bring approaches from the point of some principles and procedures of the Discourse Analysis, as they also used for analysis written and/or <b>oral</b> <b>declarations</b> given by the individuals themselves in semi-structured interviews. The analyses comes from categories, for instance, genetc rites, discursive positions and self forms associated to the writing in question, in its cration, circulation and makes evident how the manifestation of Dionysian is done: the loafing, indiscipline, cult to live in group, praise to drunkenness, the appeal to laughter, the cruelty on sight, the erroneous (in the functions of authorship, in the self care and in the concepts to writing) and the creation (in the ways of doing and assuming knowledge).

40|$|O objetivo desta pesquisa é analisar a contribuição de uma prática de ensino orientada pela Psicanálise e pela Psicologia Escolar, realizada em grupos de formação para educadores na instituição Espaço Pedagógico. Toma-se como perspectiva compreender a natureza das contribuições que esta prática tem proporcionado na construção de mudanças profissionais e pessoais, aos educadores que dela participam. As fontes de dados dessa pesquisa são os registros escritos pelos educadores, alunos dos cursos de formação, bem como registros de diário do {{professor}} no período de 1992 a 2001. Dentre um montante de 378 documentos, foram selecionadas dois para serem detalhadamente analisados. A análise do material foi feita a partir do referencial teórico da Psicanálise, destacando a presença de mudanças na posição subjetiva do aluno-educador frente ao ato de ensinar e aprender, ocorridas dentro de um grupo e numa instituição, representadas nos depoimentos orais e escritos. Para tanto, consideramos nos textos as ênfases dadas pelos alunos-educadores em determinadas temáticas e questões, os temas recorrentes, as repetições, denegações, lapsos e hesitações. Procuramos marcar as posições subjetivas ocupadas pelos alunos-educadores em seus discursos, analisando as conseqüências profissionais e pessoais que decorrem da posição em que se colocam, bem como das posições que delegam ao outro. Para tal apresentou-se as falas iniciais dos alunos-educadores, seguidas das intervenções feitas pelo professor do curso de formação, juntamente com a intervenção dos outros membros do grupo. O intuito foi identificar os efeitos produzidos, através das intervenções sofridas pelos alunos-educadores, nas suas posições subjetivas. A pesquisa demonstrou que a maneira de ensinar, orientada pela Psicanálise, juntamente com os temas desenvolvidos ao longo do curso de formação, impulsionam a problematização da prática dos educadores, configurando-se como temas que podem convocar a subjetividade dos mesmos, abrindo a possibilidade para mudanças na posição subjetiva, que por sua vez, incidem em mudanças no ambiente profissional. Conclui-se que esta prática articula os campos da Psicologia Escolar em uma perspectiva crítica, da Educação e da Psicanálise, constituindo um lugar próprio e intermediário entre os três campos. The aim of {{this research}} is to analyze the contribution of teaching practice oriented by Psychoanalysis and by Scholastic Psychology performed in groups of educators training at the Espaço Pedagógico institution. What is taken as a perspective is {{to understand the nature of}} contributions that this practice has offered in the performance of professional and personal changes for the educators who participate in it. The data sources of this research are the registers written by the educators, students of the training courses, as well as teachers daily registers from 1992 to 2001. Among 378 documents, two have been selected for detailed analysis. The analysis of the material has been done based on the theoretical reference of Psychoanalysis, highlighting the occurrence of changes in the subjective student-educator position to be formally considered in relation to the act of teaching and learning which took place in a group and in an institution, represented in the <b>oral</b> and written <b>declarations.</b> For this purpose we have considered in the texts the emphasis given by the educator-students with regard to certain themes and matters, the recurrent themes, the repetitions, denials, lapses and hesitations. We have tried to point out the subjective positions defended by the educator-students in their discourses, evaluating the professional and personal consequences that follow the position in which they place themselves, as well as the positions they delegate to others. Aiming at this the initial speakings of the educator-students were presented, followed by the interventions performed by the teacher of the training course along with the intervention performed by other members of the group. The intention was to identify the effects produced by means of the interventions that were posed to the educator-students in their subjective positions. The research has demonstrated that the manner of teaching oriented by psychoanalysis along with the themes developed during the training course stimulate the problematics of the practice of the educators, being configured as themes that can raise the subjectivity of the latter, giving room to the possibility for changes in the subjective position which, in turn, cause changes in the professional environment. Its concluded that such practice articulates the fields of Scholastic Psychology in a critical perspective, as well as the ones of Education and Psychoanalysis, constituting its own and intermediate place among the three fields...|$|R
