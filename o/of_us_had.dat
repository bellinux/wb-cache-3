25|$|In the 1930s Schmitt {{caught the}} {{attention}} of Catholic social activist Peter Maurin, founder of the Catholic Worker newspaper, which published a series of articles about him in late 1934. Catholic Worker contributing writer Donald Powell recalls the first time he met Schmitt: “Several <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> gathered to discuss social justice. I remember his stating that social justice could be obtained only by starting with the individual; that is, when the individual was just, society was just, and that the Catholic could do the most by example. Which means, in effect, that Catholics must be converted to Catholicism before attempting to convert non-Catholics to it.” Maurin himself wrote an essay about Schmitt for the newspaper, later reprinted in his book Catholic Radicalism.|$|E
25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been my most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E
25|$|I {{never did}} {{know exactly what}} was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the {{original}} meeting, association, comradeship of Allen , myself, Michael , Lawrence , Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory , for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory {{as well as the}} others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that we find ourselves so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.|$|E

500|$|According to {{designer}} Harry Teasley, id's 1993 FPS Doom {{was a major}} influence, and {{the team}} wanted Half-Life to [...] "scare you like Doom did". Newell said that [...] "Half-Life in many ways was a reactionary response to the trivialization {{of the experience of}} the first-person genre. Many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> fallen in love with video games because of the phenomenological possibilities of the field and felt like the industry was reducing the experiences to least common denominators rather than exploring those possibilities. Our hope was that building worlds and characters would be more compelling than building shooting galleries." [...] The project had the working title Quiver, after the Arrowhead military base from Stephen King's 1980 novella The Mist, an early inspiration for the game. The name Half-Life was chosen because it was evocative of the theme, not clichéd, and had a corresponding visual symbol: the Greek letter λ (lower-case lambda), which represents the decay constant in the half-life equation.|$|E

Following {{a starring role}} in the little-seen Man About Town and a minor role in the crime drama Smokin' Aces, Affleck won acclaim for his performance as George Reeves in the noir biopic Hollywoodland. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised [...] "an award-caliber performance ... This is feeling, nuanced work from an actor some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> prematurely written off." [...] Geoffrey Macnab of The Guardian said he [...] "beautifully" [...] captured [...] "the character's curious mix of charm, vulnerability and fatalism". He was awarded the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival and {{was nominated for a}} Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. Also in 2006, he made a cameo in Smith's Clerks II. Although they remain fans of each other's work, Affleck and Smith have had little contact since the making of Clerks II.|$|E

VanDerWerff argued that the episode possessed a [...] "warmth and tenderness" [...] that was missing from the following two seasons, after Duchovny left the series as a full-time star. He concluded that [...] "the genius of 'Je Souhaite' lies in how it embraces the inherent weirdness of the world this show is set in."

The other competitors were Austria, Czechoslovakia, India, Poland and the USSR; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing {{as a result of the}} boycott, having failed to qualify initially. All of the matches were played at Dynamo Minor Arena in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start, and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams. The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> ever seen it before", Chick recalled—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit. They considered themselves serious underdogs and did not expect to win a medal.|$|E

500|$|Aspinall later commented {{about his}} first meeting with George Harrison, who also {{attended}} the Liverpool Institute: [...] "My first encounter with George was behind the school’s air-raid shelters. [...] This great mass of shaggy hair loomed up and an out-of-breath voice requested a quick drag of my Woodbine. It {{was one of the first}} cigarettes either <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> smoked. We spluttered our way through it bravely but gleefully. After that the three of us did lots of ridiculous things together.... By the time we were ready to take the GCE exams we added John Lennon to our 'Mad Lad' gang. He was doing his first term at Liverpool College of Art which overlooks the Liverpool Institute playground and we all got together in a students coffee bar at lunchtime." [...] Aspinall took nine GCEs at the Institute and passed eight of them, but failed the French exam. He left school in July 1959, and studied accountancy.

500|$|As they {{approached}} the high cliffs of the coastline, heavy seas made immediate landing impossible. For more than 24hours {{they were forced to}} stand clear, as the wind shifted to the north-west and quickly developed into [...] "one of the worst hurricanes any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> ever experienced". For much of this time they were in danger of being driven on to the rocky South Georgia shore, or of being wrecked on the equally menacing Annenkov Island, five miles from the coast. On 10 May, when the storm had eased slightly, Shackleton was concerned that the weaker members of his crew would not last another day, and decided that whatever the hazard they must attempt a landing. They headed for Cave Cove near the entrance to King Haakon Bay, and finally, after several attempts, made their landing there. Shackleton was later to describe the boat journey as [...] "one of supreme strife"; historian Caroline Alexander comments: [...] "They could hardly have known—or cared—that in the carefully weighted judgement of authorities yet to come, the voyage of the James Caird would be ranked {{as one of the greatest}} boat journeys ever accomplished".|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{cartoons}} Barbera and Hanna created revolved around close friendship or partnership; this theme is evident with Fred and Barney, Tom and Jerry, Scooby and Shaggy, The Jetson family and Yogi & Boo-Boo. These {{may have been}} a reflection of the close business friendship and partnership that Barbera and Hanna [...] shared for over 60 years. Professionally, they balanced each other's strengths and weaknesses very well, but Barbera and Hanna travelled in completely different social circles. Hanna's circle of personal friends primarily included other animators; Barbera socialized with Hollywood celebrities—Zsa Zsa Gabor was a frequent visitor to his house. Their division of work roles complemented each other but they rarely talked outside of work since Hanna was interested in the outdoors and Barbera liked beaches and good food and drink. Nevertheless, in their long partnership, in which they worked with over 2000 animated characters, Barbera and Hanna rarely exchanged a cross word. Barbera said: [...] "We understood each other perfectly, and each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> deep respect for the other's work." [...] Hanna once said that Barbera could [...] "capture mood and expression in a quick sketch better than anyone I've ever known." ...|$|E
