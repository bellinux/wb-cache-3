40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to {{evaluate}} long-term results of studies focusing on improving methods for preventing and treating fish diseases using selected natural and syntetic immunomodulators and vaccines in fish culture. Simultaneously, attention is drawn to infectious or environmental threats against which appropriately composed immunoprophylaxis {{can be used in}} production cycles. Fish culture is intensifying in Poland and globally, which means that the role of prevention and well-designed prophylaxis is of increasing significance to the prevention and treatment of fish diseases. Currently, 33 fish species are cultured in Poland as stocking material or for production. The primary methods for preventing diseases in controlled fish culture are ensuring the welfare of fish and other prophylactic methods, including immunoprophylaxis. Many infectious and non-infectious threats that can cause direct losses and limit fish culture are present in the aquatic environment. Fish diseases generally stem from the simultaneous action of many factors that coincide and are difficult to distinguish. Pesticides (organochlorine insecticides, <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>herbicides),</b> aromatic hydrocarbons, pentachlorophenol, heavy metals, and chemotherapeutics are particularly toxic to fish. Biodegradation, which is continual in aquatic environments, is a process by which toxic and other substances that negatively affect fish become bioavailable and impact the immune system, the functioning of which is a specific bioindicator of environmental quality. Innate immunity {{plays a key role in}} the defense against disadvantageous factors, which also include pathogens. Immunomodulation methods can protect resistance mechanisms, thereby increasing disease prevention and treatment in controlled fish culture...|$|E

40|$|Influence of {{herbicides}} on {{the hydrogen}} peroxide generation in vacuolar extracts of red beet root (Beta vulgaris L.) was investigated. Belonging to different chemical classes of herbicide compounds have been used. Herbicides differ {{from each other}} in the mechanism of effects on plants. Clopyralid (aromatic acid herbicide, derivative of picolinic acid) and 2. 4 -D (phenoxyacetic herbicide), characterized by hormone-like effects, contributed to the formation of H 2 O 2 in vacuolar extracts. Fluorodifen (nitrophenyl ether herbicide) and diuron (urea herbicide) also have increased contents H 2 O 2. These compounds inhibit the electron transport, photosynthesis, and photorespiration in sensitive plants. Herbicidal effect of glyphosate (<b>organophosphorus</b> <b>herbicide)</b> is due to the inhibition of amino acid synthesis in plant cells. Glyphosate did not affect the content of H 2 O 2 in vacuolar extracts. Herbicide dependent H 2 O 2 -generation did not occur with oxidoreductase inhibitors, potassium cyanide and sodium azide. The results suggest that the formation of ROS in the vacuoles due to activity of oxidoreductases, which could interact with herbicides...|$|R
40|$|Glyphosate [N-phosphonomethyl]glycine is a systematic, non-selective, <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>herbicide</b> used {{worldwide}} in agriculture and industrial zones. Following its application, residues of glyphosate can threaten soil or aquatic organisms in adjacent water. In this study, {{we followed the}} degradation, stabilization, remobilization and leaching of 14 C-glyphosate in three agricultural soils in laboratory incubations and in lysimeters under field conditions. Glyphosate degradation was relatively rapid with a half-life of 14. 5 days in the silt clay loam soil incubated at 20 °C. Glyphosate’s degradation product, Aminomethylphosphonic Acid (AMPA), represented more than 85 % of residues after 80 days of laboratory incubation. Leaching of glyphosate in lysimeters of three different investigated soils under outdoor conditions was very slow, less than 1 % of the initial applied amount has been detected in the leachates after 100 days of experimentation. Glyphosate rapidly formed non-extractable residues after treatment. In summary, glyphosate was removed from soil very rapidly and its leaching {{seems to be very}} slow regardless the type of treated soil. On the other hand, the contamination risk of groundwater with its metabolite AMPA at long term is probably due to the release of the non-extractable residues...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{results from}} a systematic review {{and a series of}} meta-analyses of nearly three decades worth of epidemiologic research on the relationship between non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and occupational exposure to agricultural pesticide active ingredients and chemical groups. Estimates of associations of NHL with 21 pesticide chemical groups and 80 active ingredients were extracted from 44 papers, all of which reported {{results from a}}nalyses of studies conducted in high-income countries. Random effects meta-analyses showed that phenoxy <b>herbicides,</b> carbamate insecticides, <b>organophosphorus</b> insecticides and the active ingredient lindane, an organochlorine insecticide, were positively associated with NHL. In a handful of papers, associations between pesticides and NHL subtypes were reported; B cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy <b>herbicides</b> and the <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>herbicide</b> glyphosate. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicide exposure. Despite compelling evidence that NHL is associated with certain chemicals, this review indicates the need for investigations of a larger variety of pesticides in more geographic areas, especially in low- and middle-income countries, which, despite producing {{a large portion of the}} world’s agriculture, were missing in the literature that were reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Organophosphate {{hydrolase}} (OPH, EC 3. 1. 8. 1) is {{a bacterial}} enzyme {{with a broad}} spectrum of potential substrates that include <b>organophosphorus</b> pesticides, <b>herbicides,</b> and chemical warfare agents. OPH has been expressed successfully in bacterial, fungal, and insect cell culture systems; however, none of these systems produces amounts of enzyme suitable for applications outside of the research laboratory. Therefore, a transgenic Zea mays L. (maize) system was developed to express OPH as an alternate to the current OPH expression systems. The bacterial gene encoding the OPH protein was optimized for transcriptional and translational expression in maize. The optimized gene was inserted into the maize genome under the control of embryo specific, endosperm specific, and constitutive plant promoters. Select transformants were analyzed for the expression of OPH. Expression was observed in the seeds of plants transformed with each of the three constructs with the highest expression observed with the embryo specific and constitutive promoter constructs. The highest OPH expressing lines of transgenic maize had expression levels higher than those reported for the E. coli expression system. OPH was purified from transgenic maize seed and analyzed for posttranslational modification and kinetic properties. OPH was observed to undergo a glycosylation event when expressed in maize that yielded at least two forms of OPH homogolous dimer. The glycosylated form of OPH bound tightly to the Concanavalin A sepharose and remained active after months of storage at room temperature. OPH activity was checked against a number of organophosphate herbicides. Enzymatic activity was observed against the herbicide Amiprophos-methyl and kinetic properties were measured. Enzymatic activity was also tested against the organophosphate Haloxon. Transgenic maize callus, leaf, and seed tissue could be screened for the presence of the optimized opd gene by enzymatic activity. Comparison of the growth of transgenic and control callus on media containing organophosphates showed that the transgenic callus was resistant to the herbicidal effects of haloxon. Transgenic plants expressing OPH were also resistant to the herbicide bensulide when compared to control plants. This indicates that OPH {{can be used as a}} screenable marker in plant systems and may be a potential scorable marker system as well...|$|R
