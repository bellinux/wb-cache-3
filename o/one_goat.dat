Transvestitic {{homosexuality}} also existed amongst the Moru, Nyima, and Tira people, and reported marriages of Korongo londo and Mesakin tubele for the bride price of <b>one</b> <b>goat.</b> In the Korongo and Mesakin tribes, Nadel reported a common reluctance among men to abandon the pleasure of all-male camp life for the fetters of permanent settlement.|$|E
500|$|His first designs {{appeared}} in the 1917 book, Sihas hulin: Eyne fun di geshikhten (An Everyday Conversation), where he incorporated Hebrew letters with a distinctly art nouveau flair. His next book was a visual retelling of the traditional Jewish Passover song Had gadya (<b>One</b> <b>Goat),</b> in which Lissitzky showcased a typographic device that he would often return to in later designs. In the book, he integrated letters with images through a system that matched {{the color of the}} characters in the story with the word referring to them. In the designs for the final page, Lissitzky depicts the mighty [...] "hand of God" [...] slaying the angel of death, who wears the tsar's crown. This representation links the redemption of the Jews with the victory of the Bolsheviks in the Russian Revolution. An alternative view asserts that the artist was wary of Bolshevik internationalization, leading to destruction of traditional Jewish culture. Visual representations of the hand of God would recur in numerous pieces throughout his entire career, most notably with his 1924 photomontage self-portrait The Constructor, which prominently featured the hand.|$|E

These elements include [...] "charactor" [...] (Seelig’s term for combining an actor’s onstage persona with their offstage nature), the [...] "prism/gap" [...] (between actor and audience), and ambiguity. The essay also traces the influences of Sophocles, Zeami, Luigi Pirandello, Bertolt Brecht, Samuel Beckett, Thomas Bernhard and others on <b>One</b> Little <b>Goat’s</b> dramatic approach.|$|R

You see, these three were the ones that got a share of {{everything}} in the Sea Valley. One basket out of every three of corn was theirs, one fish out of every three, <b>one</b> <b>goat</b> out of every three. In return, they fed the guards and the watchers, and kept the rest for themselves. Sometimes, when a big haul of fish was made they {{did not know what to}} do with all their share. So Sea- Lion set the women to making money out of shell--little round pieces, with a hole in each one, and all made smooth and fine. These were strung on strings, and the strings were called money.|$|E

I {{knew that she}} would be sure to return as soon as she was hungry again, but I did not know when she would be hungry. She had left so little of Jim-Jim behind her that I should scarcely expect to see her the next night, unless indeed she had cubs. Still, I felt {{that it would not be}} wise to miss the chance of her coming, so we set about making preparations for her reception. The first thing that we did was to strengthen the bush wall of the skerm by dragging a large quantity of the tops of thorn-trees together, and laying them one on the other in such a fashion that the thorns pointed outwards. This, after our experience of the fate of Jim-Jim, seemed a very necessary precaution, since if where <b>one</b> <b>goat</b> can jump another can follow, as the Kaffirs say, how much more is this the case when an animal so active and so vigorous as the lion is concerned! And now came the further question, how were we to beguile the lioness to return? Lions are animals that have a strange knack of appearing when they are not wanted, and keeping studiously out of the way when their presence is required. Of course it was possible that if she had found Jim-Jim to her liking she would come back to see if there were any more of his kind about, but still it was not to be relied on.|$|E
