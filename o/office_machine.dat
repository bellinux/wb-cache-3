25|$|The {{labor and}} cost savings of this device were immediate, and remarkable: pages of text {{no longer had}} to be retyped to correct simple errors, and {{projects}} could be worked on, stored, and then retrieved for use later on. The rudimentary Wang 1200 machine was the precursor of the Wang Office Information System (OIS), introduced in 1976.

25|$|The word {{processor}} was a stand-alone <b>office</b> <b>machine</b> in the 1960s, combining the keyboard text-entry and printing functions {{of an electric}} typewriter with a recording unit, either tape or floppy disk (as used by the Wang machine) with a simple dedicated computer processor for the editing of text. Although features and designs varied among manufacturers and models, and new features were added as technology advanced, {{word processor}}s typically featured a monochrome display {{and the ability to}} save documents on memory cards or diskettes. Later models introduced innovations such as spell-checking programs, and improved formatting options.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the younger}} Agnelli's first steps after gaining control of Fiat {{was a massive}} {{reorganization}} of the company management, which had previously been highly centralized, with little provision for the delegation of authority and decision-making. Such a system was effective in the past, but lacked the responsiveness and flexibility needed by Fiat's steady expansion, {{and the growth of}} its international operations in the 1960s. The company was reorganized on a product-line basis, with two main product groups—one for passenger cars, the other for trucks and tractors—and a number of semi-independent division and subsidiaries. Top management, freed from responsibility for day-by-day operations of the company, was able to devote its efforts to more far-reaching goals. In 1967, Fiat made its first acquisition when it purchased Autobianchi; with sales amounting to $1.7billion, it outstripped Volkswagen, its main European competitor, and in 1968 produced some 1,750,000 vehicles while its sales volume climbed to $2.1billion. According to Newsweek in 1968, Fiat was [...] "the most dynamic automaker in Europe... may come closest to challenging the worldwide supremacy of Detroit." [...] Then, in 1969, it purchased controlling interests in Ferrari and Lancia. At the time, Fiat was a conglomerate, owning Alitalia, toll highways, a typewriter and <b>office</b> <b>machine</b> manufacturer, electronics and electrical equipment firms, a paint company, a civil engineering firm, and an international construction company. [...] Following up on an agreement Valletta had made with Soviet officials in 1966, Agnelli constructed the AvtoVAZ plant in the new city of Togliattigrad on the Volga. This began operation in 1970, producing a local version of the Fiat 124 as the Lada. On his initiative, Fiat automobile and truck plants were also constructed in industrial centers of Yugoslavia, Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania. [...] In 1973, Fiat established Comau, an industrial automation company out of the various suppliers which had equipped the AvtoVAZ plant in Russia. [...] Comau became an industry pioneer in the use of Robotics for vehicle assembly – a technology with which Fiat would become synonymous for in the 1970s, with its [...] "Robogate" [...] system for bodyshell manufacture, and the later FIRE family of robot-assembled engines in the 1980s.|$|E
