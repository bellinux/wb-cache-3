Pathological effects of <b>oxysterols</b> have also been described, and various reports have implicated <b>oxysterols</b> in several disease states, including atherosclerosis, neurological disease, and cancer. Numerous studies show that <b>oxysterols</b> are associated with various types of cancer, including cancers of the colon, lung, skin, breast and bile ducts.

Certain <b>oxysterols</b> are also involved in the induction of cyclo-oxygenase- 2 expression. Inflammatory effects can also be mediated through the activation of liver-X-receptor, a nuclear receptor for <b>oxysterols.</b> Thus, several distinct molecular mechanisms have been described showing that <b>oxysterols</b> contribute to the initiation and progression of cancers arising in various organ systems...|$|R

Most <b>oxysterols</b> are produced by enzymes of the cytochrome P 450 family while others are produced by free radical reactions. This last group of <b>oxysterols</b> (stress <b>oxysterols,</b> or SOX), which are mainly oxygenated in the C 6 or C 7 position, have attracted interest for mechanistic studies in the context of oxidative stress, and for probing oxidative stress in vivo.

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>oxysterols</b> in macrophages isolated from atherosclerotic tissue {{and the effect}} of <b>oxysterols</b> on the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA were studied. Both rabbit and human macrophages, freshly isolated from atherosclerotic aorta, show about the same distribution of <b>oxysterols,</b> analyzed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry, except that all three preparations of human arterial-derived macrophages contained high levels of 27 -hydroxycholesterol, which was not found in rabbit macrophages. To determine if <b>oxysterols</b> regulate LPL expression, human monocyte-derived macrophages were incubated with different <b>oxysterols.</b> Incubation with 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol and 25 -hydroxycholesterol resulted in a 70 - 75 % reduction of LPL mRNA, analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Cholesterol and other tested <b>oxysterols</b> showed no effect on macrophage LPL mRNA expression compared with control. LPL activity in the medium was also reduced after exposure of the macrophages to 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol and 25 -hydroxycholesterol. In conclusion, we have demonstrated accumulation of <b>oxysterols</b> in macrophage-derived foam cells isolated from atherosclerotic aorta. There was suppression of LPL mRNA in human monocyte-derived macrophages after incubation with 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol and 25 -hydroxycholesterol.

40|$|According to {{classical}} pharmacology, each neurotransmitter/hormonal receptor, including GPCRs, is exclusively activated by highly specific ligands. However, recent evidence challenges this dogma. <b>Oxysterols</b> are produced at inflammatory sites and can surprisingly potently activate the Epstein Barr virus induced gene receptor- 2 (EBI 2), a GPCR involved in adaptive immune responses. Similarly, <b>oxysterols</b> promiscuously operate CXCR 2, a chemokine receptor participating to immune reactions and cancer development. Both EBI 2 and CXCR 2 are phylogenetically related to GPR 17, another GPCR implicated in inflammatory/immune neurodegenerative events. Here, we used an integrated approach combining comparative modeling, molecular docking and in vitro experiments to investigate their potential interactions with <b>oxysterols.</b> All three receptors share the binding site to allocate <b>oxysterols</b> with different local arrangements, higher sensitivity to specific <b>oxysterols</b> and different activation thresholds. Such differences may dictate the diverse biological effects induced by <b>oxysterols,</b> depending on production site, concentration, specific spatiotemporal features and receptor expression on targeted cells. Thus, EBI 2, CXCR 2 and GPR 17 are promiscuously operated by <b>oxysterols</b> making {{this class of}} ligands a 'fil rouge' linking oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegeneration.

40|$|Cholesterol is a {{molecule}} {{with a double}} bond in its structure and is therefore susceptible to oxidation leading {{to the formation of}} <b>oxysterols.</b> These oxidation products are found in many commonly-consumed foods and are formed during their manufacture and/or processing.

Thus, their role in lipid disorders is widely suspected, and they might also be involved in important degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and age-related macular degeneration. Since atherosclerosis {{is associated with the}} presence of apoptotic cells and with oxidative and inflammatory processes, the ability of some <b>oxysterols,</b> especially 7 -ketocholesterol and 7 &# 946;-hydroxycholesterol, to trigger cell death, activate inflammation, and modulate lipid homeostasis is being extensively studied, especially in vitro.

Moreover, a substantial accumulation of polar lipids in cytoplasmic multilamellar structures has been observed with cytotoxic <b>oxysterols,</b> suggesting that cytotoxic <b>oxysterols</b> are potent inducers of phospholipidosis.

40|$|Cholesterol {{synthesis}} {{in animals}} {{is controlled by}} the regulated transport of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where the transcription factors are processed proteolytically to release active fragments.

Cholesterol acts by binding to the SREBP-escort protein Scap, thereby causing Scap to bind to anchor proteins called Insigs. Here, we show that <b>oxysterols</b> act by binding to Insigs, causing Insigs to bind to Scap. Mutational analysis of the six transmembrane helices of Insigs reveals that the third and fourth are important for Insig's binding to <b>oxysterols</b> and to Scap.
