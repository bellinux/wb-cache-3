40|$|In view of {{the fact}} that the world's {{high-grade}} natural uranium resources are limited, alternative ways of using these resources more efficiently are of interest in the line of research undertaken by IIASA's Energy Systems Program. Sole reliance on the currently predominant Light Water Reactors (LWRs) would mean to deplete these natural uranium resources rapidly. The present paper considers different strategies of uranium use involving, in addition to burners (LWRs), Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) and Advanced Converter Reactors (ACR) with an extremely high efficiency in using natural uranium. Breeder reactors in fact require only depleted natural uranium (left over from enriched LWR fuel), once a certain endowment of fissile plutonium (from burnt LWR fuel) has accumulated. Given such an endowment, the breeder output can be increased on the basis of self-generated plutonium. Although the efficiency in using natural uranium is less in advanced converter reactors, their uranium savings are enormous compared to the amounts used <b>up</b> in <b>burners.</b> Such considerations of a more efficient future uranium use by deploying advanced reactors in addition to burner reactors are based on a hypothetical trajectory of a total installed nuclear capacity increasing to 10 TW(e) by the year 2030.

The conversion of naptha to high octane aromatics requires high energy to initiate and sustain the reaction at temperatures of 850 - 950 oF. Hydrogen - rich off - gases are fired in combinations of process furnaces. Heat is transferred to hydrocarbon fluids by radiation, principally. Feed or return stream temperatures determine the need for convection sections. It is essential that the operation and maintenance of these furnaces be optimized to minimize production costs. This paper describes the performance testing and evaluation of a set of ten refinery furnaces used to thermally drive several reforming reactors and to regenerate catalysts. Firing rates provide an input of 216. 2 x 106 Btu/hr. to the furnaces, at $ 1. 90 per 106 Btu. The units are fitted with multiple natural draft burners. There is insufficient turbulence and swirl in the burners. Operators manually set <b>up</b> the <b>burners</b> with excessive airflows for normal, full-load firing. These furnaces represent production limits. Products of combustion exhaust at high thermal levels - the range is from 985 - 1700 oF.

40|$|Flameless {{combustion}} {{offers many}} advantages over conventional combustion, particularly uniform temperature distribution and lower emissions. In this paper, {{a new strategy}} is proposed and adopted to scale <b>up</b> a <b>burner</b> operating in flameless combustion mode from a heat release density of 5. 4 - 21 MW/m(3) (thermal input 21. 5 - 84. 7 kW) with kerosene fuel. A swirl flow based configuration was adopted for air injection and pressure swirl type nozzle with an SMD 35 - 37 lm was used to inject the fuel. Initially, flameless combustion was stabilized for a thermal input of 21. 5 kW ((Q) over dot '''= 5. 37 MW/m(3)). Attempts were made to scale this combustor to higher intensities i. e. 10. 2, 16. 3 and 21. 1 MW/m(3). However, an increase in fuel flow rate led to incomplete combustion and accumulation of unburned fuel in the combustor. Two major difficulties were identified as possible reasons for unsustainable flameless combustion at the higher intensities. (i) A constant spray cone angle and SMD increases the droplet number density. (ii) Reactants dilution ratio (R-dil) decreased with increased thermal input. To solve these issues, a modified combustor configuration, aided by numerical computations was adopted, providing a chamfer near the outlet to increase the R-dil. Detailed experimental investigations showed that flameless combustion mode was achieved at high intensities with an evenly distributed reaction zone and temperature in the combustor at all heat intensities. The emissions of CO, NOx and HC for all heat intensities (Phi = 1 - 0. 6) varied between 11 - 41, 6 - 19 and 0 - 9 ppm, respectively. These emissions are well {{within the range of}} emissions from other flameless combustion systems reported in the literature. The acoustic emission levels were also observed to be reduced by 8 - 9 dB at all conditions. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

The percentage of fullerenes in the condensable material increases with decreasing pressure. The overall highest amount of fullerenes was found for a surprisingly high dilution of fuel with argon. A comparison of the flames with the same cold gas velocity of fuel and oxygen showed a strong dependence of fullerene content on flame length. A shorter flame, resulting from higher dilution or lower pressure, favors the formation of fullerenes rather than soot, {{and the amount of}} soot and precursors of both soot and fullerenes is less at lower pressure and higher dilution. This behavior indicates a stronger correlation of fullerene consumption to the total amount of soot than of fullerene formation to precursor concentration. The maximum flame temperature seems to be of minor importance in fullerene formation. The HRTEM analysis of the soot showed an increase of the curvature of the carbon layers, and hence increased fullerenic character, with increasing distance from the <b>burner</b> <b>up</b> to the point of maximum fullerene concentration. After this maximum, where soot and fullerenes are consumed by oxidation, the curvature decreases. In addition to the soot, the samples included fullerenic nanostructures such as tubes and spheroids including highly ordered multilayered or onionlike structures. The soot itself shows highly ordered regions that appear to have been cells of ongoing fullerenic nanostructure formation...|$|R
40|$|One of the IM tests {{described}} in STANAG 4439 is the Fast Cook-off (FCO) test. The Liquid Fuel or External Fire, Munition Test Procedures is {{described in}} STANAG 4240 : “The objective of the selected fuel fire test is {{the determination of the}} reaction and time to reaction of the munition(s) when subjected to a liquid fuel fire environment”. However, {{there is a lot of}} discussion about this typical test. The drawback of the fuel fire test is the pollution of the environment during burning, as a result of the soot and many other substances in the fuel. Therefor a group of international experts is evaluating the use of propane as an alternate fuel for the Fast Heating Test Procedure identified in STANAG 4240 during a series of Fuel Fire Expert meetings (FFE). In the Netherlands the number of polluting large fuel fire test per year is limited but also the performance of the Dutch small fuel fire test leads to pollution and gives an undesirable situation. This is the reason that, in cooperation with the Knowledge Center of Weapons & Munitions of the Dutch MoD, also TNO has developed and tested a clean FCO test setup, based on propane. In the last IMEMTS conference the set-up was described and the results of several tests series, including a calibrating test series in co-operations with the US laboratories NSWC and NAWC, was presented. Since then, the set-up has been improved with respect to safety and several tests series have been performed to increase the hearth of the fire and improve the temperature distribution over the hearth. Also the heating of none cylindrical items such as munition boxes has been improved. The gas flow of the set-up is now remote controlled for safety reasons during live munition testing. The number of burners has been increased, <b>up</b> to 24 <b>burners</b> can now be used. Four relative expensive piezo-burners are used for ignition while the other have replace by cheaper burners without piezo-igniters. Also, the set-up of the burners has been changed; two lines of burners per side have been made, one pointing on the bottom of the tested item and one somewhere around the middle. This increases the hearth of the fire and the improves temperature distribution around the item. Now up to 10 cm below and above the test item, the temperatures are well above the 800 °C. One of the main advantages of this set-up is that burning is so clean that the fire is totally transparent and all items can be filmed during testing. With the new set-up and with the small fuel fire test a series of tests with live munitions has been performed. The results of the pre-test with the mock-ups, the results and comparison of the two tests series with live munition as well as the lessons learned from these tests series will be presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Fullerenes are {{molecules}} comprised {{entirely of}} sp²-bonded carbon atoms arranged in pentagonal and hexagonal rings {{to form a}} hollow, closed-cage structure. Buckyballs, a subset which contains C₆₀ and C₇₀, are single-shell molecules while fullerenic nanostructures can contain many shells and over 300 carbon atoms. Both fullerenes and nanostructures have an array of applications {{in a wide variety}} of fields, including medical and consumer products. Fullerenes were discovered in 1985 and were first isolated from the products of a laminar low-pressure premixed benzene/oxygen/argon flame operating at fuel-rich conditions in 1991. Flame studies indicated that fullerene yields depend on operating parameters such as temperature, pressure, residence time, and equivalence ratio. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) showed that the soot contains nanostructures, including onions and nanotubes. Although flame conditions for forming fullerenes have been identified, the process has not been optimized and many flame environments of potential interest are unstudied. Mechanistic characteristics of fullerene formation remain poorly understood and cost estimation of large-scale production has not been performed. Accordingly, this work focused on: 1) studying fullerene formation in diffusion and premixed flames under new conditions to identify optimal parameters; 2) investigating the reaction of fullerenes with soot; 3) positively identifying C₆₀ molecules in HRTEM by tethering them to carbon black; and 4) providing a cost estimation for industrial fullerenic soot production. (cont.) Samples of condensable material from laminar low-pressure benzene/argon/oxygen diffusion flames were collected and analyzed by high-performance liquid chroma- tography (HPLC) and HRTEM. The highest concentration of fullerenes in a flame was always detected just above the height where the fuel is consumed. The percentage of fullerenes in condensable material increases with decreasing pressure and the fullerene content of flames with similar cold gas velocities shows a strong dependence on length. A shorter flame, resulting from higher dilution or lower pressure, favors the formation of fullerenes rather than soot, exhibited by the lower amount of soot and precursors in such flames. This indicates a stronger correlation of fullerene consumption to soot levels than of fullerene formation to precursor concentration. The maximum flame temperature seems to be of minor importance in formation. The overall highest amount of fullerenes was found for a surprisingly high dilution of fuel with argon. The HRTEM analysis showed an increase of the curvature of the carbon layers, and hence increased fullerenic character, with increasing distance from the <b>burner</b> <b>up</b> to the point of maximum fullerene concentration, after which it decreases, consistent with the HPLC analysis. The soot shows highly ordered regions that appear to have been cells of fullerenic nanostructure formation. The samples also included fullerenic nanostructures such as tubes and spheroids including highly-ordered multilayered or onion-like structures. Studies of turbulent-like benzene/oxygen/argon diffusion flames showed that these flames produce fullerenes over a wider range of heights than laminar flames but with lower yields. (cont.) No discernible trend could be detected in the data and the fullerene results were not easily reproducible indicating that such flames are not suitable for fullerene formation. Soot samples were also collected from a well-characterized laminar premixed benzene/oxygen/argon flat flame under new conditions and analyzed by HPLC and HRTEM. Flame studies using secondary injections of benzene or acetylene show that two-stage flames are unsuitable for fullerene production. It seems that secondary fuel has an adverse effect on the formation of fullerenes and creates conditions that are similar to the early stages of a single-stage flame prior to soot formation. This means that fuel must go through the combustion process to form fullerenes and that they cannot be formed simply by organic pyrolysis. Additionally, fullerene data collected in this study show significantly higher yields than in a previous study and the absence of a concentration drop-off. The coexistence of fullerenes and soot does not support but also does not rule out that fullerenes are consumed by soot, as was suggested by diffusion flame data. Given the discrepancy in the data, fullerene consumption was studied in experiments involving pure fullerenes being sublimated into a passing argon gas stream. This gas stream then passed through a carbon black bed. As the fullerenes passed through the bed, a certain percentage reacted with the surface of the particles and the non-reacted material was collected downstream. Experiments at different temperatures indicate that fullerenes are indeed consumed by soot particles but that the consumption is quite slow. (cont.) The rate coefficient obtained resembles those seen for surface diffusion controlled reactions or for heterogeneous reactions. Extrapolation of the reaction coefficient to flame conditions would indicated that this type of fullerene consumption is not nearly enough to explain the consumption observed in fullerene-forming flames, meaning that fullerenes are consumed by other mechanisms. HRTEM analysis of carbon black with and without tethered fullerenes shows that fullerenes can in fact be observed in TEM micrographs. In this experiment, functionalized C₆₀ molecules were attached to the surface of carbon black particles with a chemical tether. The resulting compound was analyzed by HRTEM and compared with similar analysis of untreated carbon black. The post-treatment carbon black not only has an order of magnitude greater concentration of apparent fullerene structures but size distribution data shows a significant peak at the C₆₀ diameter for the treated sample whereas no peak is observed for the untreated sample. This indicates that the fullerenes have indeed been attached to the particle surface and that they can definitively be seen in images produced from HRTEM. Lastly, a model was built to estimate the cost of the large scale production of fullerenic soot. This model was based on current carbon black technology and takes into account operating parameters specific for fullerene production. Sensitivity analyses performed on the model indicate that soot yield and fuel price are the most important factors in determining production cost while electricity costs are minimally important. (cont.) It was seen that operating pressure and equipment lifetime are negligible in the final cost. Overall, combustion holds immense promise to be a much cheaper and more efficient alternative to the current method of commercial fullerene production. by Anish Goel. Thesis (Ph. D.)
