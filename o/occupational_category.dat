40|$|Identified {{skeletal}} collections, i. e. skeletons {{for which}} sex, {{age at death}} and occupation at death are known, {{have been used to}} test methods for recording entheseal changes (EC). By testing methods on identified collections the sensitivity of EC for recording activity levels can be ascertained prior to applying the methods to test hypotheses in archaeological contexts. However, the definition of <b>occupational</b> <b>categories</b> used for this research may, in itself, be a source of bias. The aim in this study was to test how categorizing occupation affected the interpretation of EC. Male skeletons (n= 211) from two Portuguese identified skeletal collections were used. Three methods for categorizing occupations, all of which have been previously published, were used each dividing occupations into 5, 3 and 2 categories, respectively. Fibrocartilaginous entheses were recorded and EC scored as present/absent. Results showed that the method for categorizing occupation affected the frequencies of EC found in <b>occupational</b> <b>categories</b> for specific entheses. Frequencies which were significantly different between <b>occupational</b> <b>categories</b> for one method were not necessarily significant for others. This demonstrates that the sensitivity of the occupational categorization does affect the results. However, using logistic regression age was found to have a greater effect than occupation. These results demonstrate the need for standardized <b>occupational</b> <b>categories,</b> as well as the importance of considering age.

Yet, the goal of access to a complex economic role had not yet been realized.

Management positions with plantations and cooperatives, as well as the highest paid positions in the Public Service, continued to be held by expatriates.

40|$|Aims: Because {{occupational}} classification systems {{tend to be}} less precise in the female sector of the working market there has been concern that this might imply more misclassification of socioeconomic position among women, biasing comparisons of gender-specific socioeconomic differences in risk. Methods: The Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program (SHEEP) is a population-based case-control study of risk factors for incident myocardial infarction. The study base included all Swedish citizens aged 45 ‚Äì 70 in Stockholm County during 1992 ‚Äì 94, 550 female and 1201 male cases, and 776 female and 1538 male controls. The use of an {{occupational classification}} as the base for categorizing socioeconomic position was compared with socioeconomic position based on detailed self-reported information on job titles and work tasks. Results: Women are categorized into fewer <b>occupational</b> <b>categories</b> than men and the socioeconomic heterogeneity within <b>occupational</b> <b>categories</b> is substantial for women as has been reported by others. However, despite more <b>occupational</b> <b>categories</b> for male types of jobs the socioeconomic heterogeneity within <b>occupational</b> <b>categories</b> is actually larger for men, implying larger misclassification among men. In simulations with different levels of socioeconomic misclassification among women, the effects on the gender comparison of socioeconomic differences in disease risk were small and they were mostly compensated for by less misclassification among men. Conclusions: The findings do not support the assumption that misclassification of socioeconomic position among women due to a restricted working market and a crude occupational classification for female jobs is an important issue when comparing measures of socioeconomic inequalities in health between men and women...|$|R

So, the role of individual level mental ability in pursuit of educational attainment - professional positions require specific educational credentials. Furthermore, educational attainment contributes to social class attainment through the contribution of mental ability to educational attainment. Even further, mental ability can contribute to social class attainment independent of actual educational attainment, as in when the educational attainment is prevented, individuals with higher mental ability manage {{to make use of}} the mental ability to work their way up on the social ladder. This study made clear that intergenerational transmission of educational attainment is one of the key ways in which social class was maintained within family, and there was also evidence that education attainment was increasing over time. Finally, the results suggest that social mobility (moving upward and downward) has increased in recent years in Britain.
