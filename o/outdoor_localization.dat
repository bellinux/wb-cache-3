To get the complete idea and how those sensors work, first I present the types of techniques and methods which are used in both, indoor and <b>outdoor</b> <b>localizations.</b> Then, I {{take a look at}} the conditions and requirements for selecting a specific system in a given use case. Finally I make a comparison between the most important indoor location systems and take a look when and under what circumstances we may use each of them. For the outdoor location sensing there is an explanation of how to use GPS, which is still the only usable system, and how in the future the competition between GPS, Galileo and GLONASS will be run, and what are the main problems which they face. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{range of}} {{applications}} requiring ubiquitous (indoor and <b>outdoor)</b> high-accuracy <b>localization</b> is rapidly increasing, {{and it is}} well known that the accuracy and availability of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which remains the most common positioning technology, drop in indoor environments and urban canyons. This aspect has motivated extensive work on alternative localization solutions [1], which are based on radio signals that are either transmitted by dedicated sensors or by opportunistic transmitters (e.g., WiFi routers or towers of a cellular system). In both cases, fingerprinting may play an important role [2] in meeting the high accuracy and low complexity requirements of indoor positioning [3].|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Autonomous outdoor {{navigation}} algorithms are re-quired {{in various}} military and industry fields. A stable and robust <b>outdoor</b> <b>localization</b> algorithm {{is critical to}} successful outdoor navigation. However, unpredictable external effects and interrup-tion of the GPS signal cause difficulties in <b>outdoor</b> <b>localization.</b> To address this issue, first we devised a new optical navigation sensor that measures a mobile robot’s transverse distance without being subjected to external influence. Next, using the optical navigation sensor, a novel localization algorithm is established with Inertial-Measurement-Unit (IMU) and GPS.

30|$|Most {{commercial}} implementations of fingerprint-based <b>outdoor</b> GSM <b>localization</b> {{exploit the}} standard Network Measurement Reports, NMR, which, {{according to the}} GSM norm, the mobile station transmits to its serving Base Transceiver Station (BTS) roughly twice per second during a communication. Each 7 -element NMR contains the RSS measurements of fixed-power beacon signals emanating from the serving BTS and its six strongest neighbors. In contrast, the frequency scans recorded by our TEMS and M 2 M modules are performed in idle mode, that is, when no call is in progress. Although NMRs are thus not available in our data, the scans nonetheless contain data on all channels, and include, at least in principle, the BSIC of each channel. This allows, for example, to 'construct' an NMR artificially, as {{was done in the}} definition of the Current Top 7 fingerprint in Section 2.2.|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, {{to tackle}} the problems with GPS, many researchers have proposed {{a variety of different}} schemes for <b>outdoor</b> <b>localization</b> based on mobile devices.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} outdoor autonomous robot localization for agricultural operations. A 12 hp power tiller, {{commonly known as the}} walking two wheel tractor is used as the test platform after after introducing electrical actuators for its remote and autonomous operation. The mathematical model of the power tiller has been developed and simulated in MatLab SImulink. A vision based <b>outdoor</b> <b>localization</b> system is developed using off-the-shelf electronic components, and its accuracy has been verified in small agricultural fields. Visual odometry using a downward faced camera is tested with better resolution for relative localization, and popular visual odometry algorithms were tested for speed and accuracy in agricultural fields. A stereo vision based range measurement system has also been developed and field tested as an absolute localization system that can bound the incremental error caused by the visual odometry system. The extended Kalman filter with measurement gaiting has been implemented using both visual odometry and stereo range measurement data.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the problem of}} <b>outdoor</b> vehicle <b>localization</b> during unusual maneuvers with the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) approaches. IMM, contrary to classical methods, {{is based on the}} discretization of the vehicle evolution space into simple maneuvers. Each maneuver is represented by a simple dynamic model such as a constant velocity or a constant turning model. This allows the method to be optimized for highly dynamic vehicles. In this work, we focus on unusual vehicle maneuvers during some special driving situations, including very strong accelerations, high speed turnings or backwards driving with stop stages. The presented results are based on real measurements collected from different scenarios. Based on an EKF vs. IMM comparison, these results show a real interest of using the IMM method in order to take into account unusual maneuvers...|$|R
30|$|Other {{techniques}} for both <b>outdoor</b> and indoor <b>localization</b> mainly {{fall into two}} categories: fingerprint-based and modeling-based. The main idea of the fingerprint is to first establish a database of signal fingerprint of each location based on the surrounding environment and then match the measured fingerprint to the database. The mapping returns the location with the most similar fingerprint. Modeling-based techniques rely on some theoretical or experimental signal propagation models, relating delay or strength to distance, and then calculate the location based on estimated distances.|$|R

30|$|As we know, GPS {{is one of}} {{the most}} typical <b>outdoor</b> <b>localization.</b> It is an energy-hungry {{technology}} and two reasons lead to it’s high battery energy cost.

Another feasible method is GSM-based localization [12], such as Nericell [21], which is widely available but with low accuracy (up to hundreds of meters). Also, it needs to know the exact position of cellular towers in advance.|$|E

Our data sets, each consisting {{of a large number}} of panoramic images, have been acquired over a period of nine months with large seasonal changes (snowcovered ground, bare trees, autumn leaves, dense foliage, etc.).

40|$|When {{a mobile}} robot is {{executing}} a navigational task {{in an urban}} <b>outdoor</b> environment, accurate <b>localization</b> information is often essential. The difficulty of this task is compounded by sensor drop-out {{and the presence of}} non-linear error sources over the span of the mission. We have observed that certain motions of the robot and environmental conditions affect pose sensors in different ways. In this paper, we propose a computational method for localization that systematically integrates and evaluates contextual information that affects the quality of sensors, and utilize the information in order to improve the output of sensor fusion. Our method was evaluated in comparison with conventional probabilistic localization methods (namely, the extended Kalman filter and Monte Carlo localization) in a set of outdoor experiments. The results of the experiment are also reported in this paper...|$|R

Our system relies on stereo vision to robustly estimate frame-to-frame motion {{in real time}} (also known as visual odometry). The motion estimation problem is formulated efficiently in the disparity space and results in accurate and robust estimates of the motion even for a small-baseline configuration. Our system uses inertial measurements to fill in motion estimates when visual odometry fails. This incremental motion is then fused with a low-cost GPS sensor using a Kalman Filter to prevent long-term drifts.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{vehicular}} networks and <b>outdoor</b> pedestrian <b>localization.</b> In particular, it targets secure positioning in vehicular networks and pedestrian localization for safety services in outdoor environments. The former research topic must cope with three major challenges, concerning users' privacy, computational costs {{of security and}} the system trust on user correctness. This thesis addresses those issues by proposing a new lightweight privacy-preserving framework for continuous tracking of vehicles. The proposed solution is evaluated in both dense and sparse vehicular settings through simulation and experiments in real-world testbeds. In addition, this thesis explores the benefit given {{by the use of}} low frequency bands for the transmission of control messages in vehicular networks. The latter topic is motivated by a significant number of traffic accidents with pedestrians distracted by their smartphones. This thesis proposes two different localization solutions specifically for pedestrian safety: a GPS-based approach and a shoe-mounted inertial sensor method. The GPS-based solution is more suitable for rural and suburban areas while it is not applicable in dense urban environments, due to large positioning errors. Instead the inertial sensor approach overcomes the limitations of previous technique in urban environments. Indeed, by exploiting accelerometer data, this architecture is able to precisely detect the transitions from safe to potentially unsafe walking locations without the need of any absolute positioning system...|$|R

We first look into which of the dominating image feature algorithms, SIFT or the more recent SURF, that is most suitable for this task. We then fine-tune our localization algorithm in terms of accuracy, and also introduce the epipolar constraint to further improve the result. The final localization algorithm is applied on multiple data sets, each consisting of a large number of panoramic images, which have been acquired over a period of nine months with large seasonal changes. The final localization rate in the single-image matching, cross-seasonal case is between 80 to 95 %...|$|R
40|$|UHF RFID tags {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} as transfer tattoos on-skin [1]. However, the performance of these designs are limited owing to their very close proximity to highly lossy tissues which makes them unsuited for application in dense environments required in many sensitive tracking and identification applications, because of the inherent high power narrow band requirements of UHF RFID. Conversely, many proposed high resolution internal location systems use Impulse Radio Ultra-Wideband (IR-UWB) transmission with narrow RF pulses {{of a few hundred}} picoseconds spread over several GHz of bandwidth and with a power spectral density in the noise floor. These low spectral power density pulses are very difficult to detect and almost invisible to unauthorized readers as UWB pulses are indistinguishable from the noise, and can be detected only by receivers using correlation [2]. UWB RFID tags have been shown in location systems to offer fine temporal and spatial resolution, with cm level accuracy in both <b>outdoor</b> and indoor <b>localization</b> in all three dimensions [3]...|$|R

Only particular indoor cellular deployments (such as small cells, low powered base station that can be installed indoors) have been analyzed [8]. In this field, the works [9, 10] presented a fingerprint technique based in the mapping and use of radio signals from femtocells (a particular type of small cells) for localization of mobile terminals in indoor environments (few meters). However, such indoor cellular deployments are still not widely implemented and costly.|$|E
30|$|VO is an {{inexpensive}} and alternative odometry technique {{that is more}} accurate than conventional techniques, such as GPS, INS, wheel odometry, and sonar localization systems, with a relative position error ranging from 0.1 to 2 % (Scaramuzza and Fraundorfer 2011). This method is characterized by good balance among cost, reliability, and implementation complexity (Nistér et al. 2004). The use of a consumer-grade camera instead of expensive sensors or systems, such as GPS, INS, and laser-based localization systems, is a straightforward and inexpensive method to estimate robot location (Nistér et al. 2006; Gonzalez et al. 2012; Nourani-Vatani et al. 2009).
