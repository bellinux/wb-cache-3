500|$|During production, Benson felt one {{recording}} {{session with}} Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf {{went beyond the}} ordinary {{to the point where}} he left the recording room and told Powell [...] "You have to go <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> and her do this because you're coming to God right now in front of my eyes. You guys handle it". According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E
500|$|Several bonus tracks follow on {{separate}} editions; some continue the teenage theme, {{while others are}} joke tracks. Barker used Afro-Cuban influences for his drum track on [...] "Don't Tell Me It's Over", and DeLonge used something other than his punk influences for [...] "What Went Wrong". [...] While DeLonge felt [...] "staple acoustic songs" [...] were big for groups at the time (such as Green Day's [...] "Good Riddance"), the band wrote all of their songs from their inception on acoustic guitars, and he felt he would rather have [...] "What Went Wrong" [...] in its original form. [...] "You grow up and realize, 'Fuck! Who gives a fuck about punk rock?'" [...] he said. [...] "There are so many great forms of music <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> grow beyond wanting to listen to or write something because your parents will hate it."

2500|$|Springfield {{introduced}} the Motown sound {{to a wider}} UK audience, both with her covers of Motown songs, and by facilitating the first UK TV appearance for The Temptations, The Supremes, The Miracles, and Stevie Wonder on {{a special edition of}} the Ready Steady Go! show – which was produced by Wickham – called The Sound of Motown. On 28 April 1965 it was broadcast by Rediffusion TV, with Springfield opening each half of the show accompanied by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas and Motown's in-house band, The Funk Brothers. The associated Tamla-Motown Revue featuring The Supremes, The Miracles and Wonder had started in London in March, and according to The Supremes' Mary Wilson, the tour was a flop: [...] "It's always... disheartening when you go <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> see the house is half-full... but once you're on stage... You perform as well for five as you do for 500." [...] Wickham, a fan of the Motown artists, booked them for the Ready Steady Go! special and enlisted Springfield to host it. In 1966 Springfield released three additional UK Top20 hits: [...] "Little By Little" [...] and two dramatic ballads – one written by Carole King: [...] "Goin' Back" [...] and [...] "All I See Is You," [...] written by Ben Weisman & Clive Westlake, which also reached the US Top20. In August and September 1966, she hosted Dusty, a six-part music and talk show weekly BBC TV series. A compilation of her singles, Golden Hits released in November 1966, reached No.2 in the UK. From the mid-1960s, Springfield would use the pseudonym [...] "Gladys Thong" [...] when recording backing vocals for other artists including Madeline Bell, Kiki Dee, Anne Murray and Elton John. Bell was a regular backing singer on early Springfield albums, and the pair co-wrote [...] "I'm Gonna Leave You" [...] with Lesley Duncan, which appeared as the B-side of [...] "Goin' Back." ...|$|E

Fame and Glory started 4/5 favourite to repeat his 2011 win in the race with the next three in the betting being the Doncaster Cup winner Saddler's Rock (9/2), Opinion Poll (5/1) and Colour Vision (6/1). The other five runners were outsiders, starting at odds of 25/1 or more. Dettori settled the gelding just behind the leaders as Gulf of Naples set a steady pace but then made a forward move in the straight. He took the lead approaching the final furlong and rallied after being headed by Opinion Poll to regain the advantage and win by half a length. Saddler's Rock was a neck away in third ahead of Gulf of Naples with Fame and Glory running poorly to finish seventh.
