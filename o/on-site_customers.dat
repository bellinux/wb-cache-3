40|$|Abstract. Agile methods such {{as extreme}} {{programming}} are becoming increasingly important for the rapid development of software applications. They proofed to be applicable and beneficial {{for a variety of}} domains. Nevertheless, due to the iterative nature of these approaches, software developers focus on functional aspects and tend to neglect nonfunctional characteristics, like usability. This paper addresses this issue by providing an extension suggestion for extreme programming that helps the on-site customer and development team to take into account usability. Usability criteria are attached to user stories, and a new type of user stories, called usability stories are introduced. This also influences the way <b>on-site</b> <b>customers</b> perform the acceptance test. We present first results of a case study where small changes to extreme programming have been introduced. The benefits were an increased perception of usability due to the integration into the user stories and an early evaluation of usability criteria in the acceptance test. Eventually, these measures lead to a high usability of the software system. ...|$|E
40|$|Does an agile {{software}} development process require real organizational change or can an existing organization become more agile? How do the many traditional information technology (IT) roles {{such as the}} business analyst, architect, and tester become a more integrated part of an agile process? Some recent work [1] debunks the myths that agile processes require <b>on-site</b> <b>customers,</b> produce ad-hoc requirements and design, and cannot scale to large projects. This article furthers this work by introducing innovative techniques from a new agile process developed and used by projects within Microsoft. These techniques span the traditional IT roles such as the business analyst, project manager, architect, developer, tester, and release manager. Many of today’s more popular agile {{software development}} processes concentrate strictly on the developer and project manager. Traditional information technology (IT) roles such as business analysts, architects, and testers do not {{play a part in}} many of these agile processes.

40|$|Abstract. Extreme {{programming}} (XP), {{similar to}} other agile software development methods, values close collaboration with customers. One of the XP's practices suggests that customer should be 100 % available for the development team. Anecdotal {{evidence suggests that the}} XP customer role is costly, difficult and demanding. However, very few empirical studies have been published on the customer’s role in an XP project. This paper reports empirical results from a controlled XP case study where the customer was present close to 100 % of the development time. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be presented. Results are in line with the common belief that the <b>on-site</b> <b>customer’s</b> role is demanding and requires a strong ability to resolve issues rapidly but offer contrasting findings in terms of required actual customer involvement in the development project. The empirical case demonstrates that while customer was present close to 100 % with the development team, only 21 % of his work effort was required to assist the team in the development. However, it is also shown that an <b>on-site</b> <b>customer</b> may create a false sense of confidence in to the system under development. The implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Agile methods promise {{an ideal}} {{approach}} to customer involvement. However, the success relies {{on having a}} full-time dedicated, <b>on-site</b> <b>customer</b> representative working in closecollaboration with the developers throughout all phases of the project {{in order to provide}} the team with ongoing domain expertize. For many projects, providing this form of customer involvement is infeasible. Organizations are therefore left with finding a more viable way of practicing customer involvementThrough a case study of medium-sized, multi-national organization, practicing agile software development with off-site customer representatives, I illuminated the challenges emerging from this situation.

40|$|Agile {{methods are}} a {{departure}} from plan-driven traditional approaches, where {{the focus is on}} generating early releases of working software using collaborative techniques, code refactoring, and <b>on-site</b> <b>customer</b> involvement. Research and surveys have shown that agile methodologies are an efficient way of producing software with significant advantages in production costs, time-to-market, complexity, and quality improvement over heavy-weight traditional methodologies. Even with such apparent advantages the information technology industry has not seen large-scale adoption of agile methods. In this survey paper, the major challenges in adopting agile practices by enterprises are addressed. Drawing information from the literature issues like framework for agile organizational change and adoption strategies are examined. Inputs from the industry suggest that most organizations are best suited in adopting a combination of traditional and agile method. There is no agile methodology that can be universally applied and have to be tailored to integrate into existing processes...|$|R
40|$|Agile teams {{commonly}} use User Stories, {{conversations with}} Customers, and Test Cases to gather requirements. Some agile teams {{like to add}} other artifacts, such as Use Cases to provide more detail to the agile requirements. This paper {{presents the results of}} a controlled experiment aimed to find evidence that Use Cases could help agile requirements, and, indirectly, to find if agile requirements techniques are sufficient. In the study, subjects were given requirements for three maintenance tasks as Use Cases, as agile requirements, or both. We found that subjects using Use Cases spent less time understanding requirements in contrast to subjects not using Use Cases. In addition the presence of the Use Cases helped subjects to ask better questions to the <b>On-site</b> <b>Customer.</b> However, we could not determine if subjects using Use Cases understood the requirements better. We conclude that the inclusion of Use Cases in agile requirements could benefit agile teams. 1...|$|R

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an <b>on-site</b> <b>Customer</b> Behavior IDentification system based on passive RFID tags, named CBID. By collecting and analyzing wireless signal features, CBID can detect and track tag movements and further infer corresponding customer behaviors. We model three main objectives of behavior identification by concrete problems and solve them using novel protocols and algorithms. The design innovations of this work include a Doppler effect based protocol to detect tag movements, an accurate Doppler frequency estimation algorithm, a multi-RSS based tag localization protocol, and a tag clustering algorithm using cosine similarity. We have implemented a prototype of CBID in which all components are built by off-the-shelf devices. We have deployed CBID in real environments and conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of CBID in customer behavior identification. I...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} Distributed Agile Development (DAD). DAD is a software development methodology which allows developers to use agile methods {{when they are not}} collocated. DAD is compared and contrasted to Extreme Programming (XP) in the areas of pair programming and having an <b>on-site</b> <b>customer.</b> The authors provide both reflections and concrete evidence showing that DAD offers the primary benefits of other Agile methods, as well as having advantages over these methods in certain situations. DAD allows developers to work on projects outside their primary vocations. The authors assert these facts have definite social benefits including allowing full-time developers to work on projects they are passionate about and adding to the collective knowledge of humanity. Based upon the value of DAD as a software and social instrument, we argue that it is a methodology of substantive value to startup companies. Since developers can experiment with startups without leaving their regular jobs, they can be active in a startup while mitigating personal risk. We also discuss the need for support systems within DAD. Lastly, we suggest future work which can be done on this subject...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{activity}} session held at XP 2003 in Genoa, Italy in May 2003. The {{intention of the}} session was to collect experience of customer collaboration in XP projects {{with the intention of}} identifying common models, their critical success factors and their pitfalls. As reported in the books, XP expects an <b>on-site</b> <b>customer,</b> i. e. someone co-located with the development team who is able to make decisions about required functionality and funding {{while at the same time}} representing the real users of the product. Anecdotal evidence has suggested that this model is not widely used, and the results of this session confirm that there are many different successful models used in practice. 1. Background The Agile manifesto emphasises the importance of valuing "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation". An overview of requirements is expected at the beginning of an agile project, but the principle of collaborative partnerships between developers and customers underpins the process of negotiation required to expand the requirements and manage constant change. In XP, this principle is instantiated through the practice of having an 'on-site customer', someone who is available to answer questions, resolve disputes and set small-scale priorities on an on-going basis (Beck, 2000).

Incineration disinfects, destroys the original nature of medical waste, {{and reduces the}} waste volume by converting organic waste content to carbon dioxide and water, leaving only residual inorganic ash. However, medical waste incinerator numbers have plummeted from almost 2, 400 in 1995 to 115 in 2003 and to about 62 in 2005, due to negative public perception and escalating compliance costs associated with increasingly strict regulations. High-temperature electric melters have been designed and marketed as incinerator alternatives, {{but they are also}} costly and generally must comply with the same incinerator emissions regulations and permitting requirements. Autoclave processes disinfect medical waste at much lower operating temperatures than incinerators operate at, but are sometimes subject to limitations such as waste segregration requirements to be effective.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{work completed}} for the California Energy Commission (CEC) on the continued development {{and application of}} the Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM). This work was performed at Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) between July 2000 and June 2001 under the Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTS) Distributed Energy Resources Integration (DERI) project. Our research on distributed energy resources (DER) builds {{on the concept of}} the microgrid ({mu}Grid), a semiautonomous grouping of electricity-generating sources and end-use sinks that are placed and operated for the benefit of its members. Although a {mu}Grid can operate independent of the macrogrid (the utility power network), the {mu}Grid is usually interconnected, purchasing energy and ancillary services from the macrogrid. Groups of customers can be aggregated into {mu}Grids by pooling their electrical and other loads, and the most cost-effective combination of generation resources for a particular {mu}Grid can be found. In this study, DER-CAM, an economic model of customer DER adoption implemented in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) optimization software is used, to find the cost-minimizing combination of <b>on-site</b> generation <b>customers</b> (individual businesses and a {mu}Grid) in a specified test year. DER-CAM's objective is to minimize the cost of supplying electricity to a specific customer by optimizing the installation of distributed generation and the self-generation of part or all of its electricity. Currently, the model only considers electrical loads, but combined heat and power (CHP) analysis capability is being developed under the second year of CEC funding. The key accomplishments of this year's work were the acquisition of increasingly accurate data on DER technologies, including the development of methods for forecasting cost reductions for these technologies, {{and the creation of a}} credible example California {mu}Grid for use in this study and in future work.

40|$|Power grids are {{critical}} infrastructure assets that face non-technical losses (NTL) such as electricity theft or faulty meters. NTL may range up to 40 % {{of the total}} electricity distributed in emerging countries. Industrial NTL detection systems are still largely based on expert knowledge when deciding whether to carry out costly <b>on-site</b> inspections of <b>customers.</b> Electricity providers are reluctant to move to large-scale deployments of automated systems that learn NTL profiles from data due to the latter's propensity to suggest {{a large number of}} unnecessary inspections. In this paper, we propose a novel system that combines automated statistical decision making with expert knowledge. First, we propose a machine learning framework that classifies customers into NTL or non-NTL using a variety of features derived from the customers' consumption data. The methodology used is specifically tailored to the level of noise in the data. Second, in order to allow human experts to feed their knowledge in the decision loop, we propose a method for visualizing prediction results at various granularity levels in a spatial hologram. Our approach allows domain experts to put the classification results into the context of the data and to incorporate their knowledge for making the final decisions of which customers to inspect. This work has resulted in appreciable results on a real-world data set of 3. 6 M customers. Our system is being deployed in a commercial NTL detection software.
