5|$|In the present, Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) {{discusses}} Fassl's release—due to DNA evidence—with an outraged Doggett. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{confirms that}} the test results conclusively disprove Fassl as the killer. Meanwhile, <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse,</b> Fassl notices a mysterious Bearded Man. After being released, he stays in a room belonging to his lawyer, Jana Fain, where he clutches a Rosary beads and prays frantically. When the Bearded Man appears, Fassl begs for the man not to hurt her. While Fain is unharmed, Fassl learns that the housekeeper, Mrs. Dowdy, has gone missing. Fassl finds her body, cleans up the blood, and dismembers her remains to cover up what has happened.|$|E
5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their fists and yell so he could get a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E
5|$|His {{business}} interests having collapsed, Baker abandoned his farm and relocated from New South Wales {{to the southern}} settlement of Hobart in Van Diemen's Land. In 1814 he is recorded as holding the office of government storekeeper in Hobart. A year later, at an approximate age of 54, he accepted a job as town crier for the newly created Deputy Judge Advocate's Court, calling witnesses and announcing verdicts on the roadside <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse.</b> Any remaining business links with New South Wales were severed in 1819 with the sale of Baker's former farm to a colleague, Samuel Terry, who had recently visited him in Hobart. His wife, Elizabeth Baker, died in April 1824 and was buried in Hobart Cemetery.|$|E

The bombers {{could not find a}} parking space near the intended target of the courthouse, and the car was left 400 metres away. As a result, three inaccurate telephone warnings were issued, and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) believed the bomb was located <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse.</b> They attempted to establish a security cordon to keep civilians clear of the area, which inadvertently pushed people closer to the location of the bomb. Shortly after, the bomb exploded killing 29 people and injuring 220 others, in what became the single deadliest strike of the Troubles.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{defection}} of {{some former}} supporters, many Zuma supporters continued to rally <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse,</b> arousing criticism by anti-rape groups for regular {{attacks on the}} integrity and moral standing of Zuma's accuser, insults yelled at {{a close friend of}} the accuser, and even stones thrown at a woman that members of the crowd mistook for the accuser. Zuma's defence team introduced evidence relating to the woman's sexual past, and asserted that the sex that took place was consensual. The prosecution asserted that her lack of resistance was due to a state of shock, and that {{the relationship between the two}} was like that of a 'father-daughter' pair.|$|E

[...] Large numbers of {{supporters}} of the defendants protested <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> on a daily basis. The trial featured twice on the cover of Time magazine. [...] The defense frequently antagonized the judge and prosecution, and five defendants were jailed for contempt of court because they disrupted the proceedings.

500|$|An {{appeals court}} {{overturned}} Sonando's conviction on anti-state charges on 14 March 2013, finding {{that there had}} been no evidence to convict him.

Amnesty International called the ruling [...] "a positive step for freedom of expression in the country", but added that [...] "Mam Sonando should never have been imprisoned in the first place, and the convictions that stand appear baseless." [...] Sonando was released from prison on 15 March, the day after the ruling. Following his release, Sonando stated his intention to clear his name of the remaining charges.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Susie Dietter. There is a statue portraying The Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> in the episode. Oakley {{said that this was}} a mistake because he and Weinstein thought that Springfield was located in Swartzwelder County, incorrectly going off a montage in the season three episode [...] "Dog of Death". That montage depicts Springfield as being located in Springfield County; Swartzwelder is the adjoining county. The appearance of the female Child Protective Services agent is based on a teacher both Oakley and Weinstein had in high school that they hated. Cast member Hank Azaria's voice for the character Cletus was slightly distorted in this episode because, over the summer between seasons, Azaria and the producers had forgotten what Cletus sounds like.|$|E
