5|$|Bowel: bowel {{problems}} affect around 70% of {{the patients}}, with around 50% {{of the patients}} suffering from constipation and up to 30% from fecal incontinence. Cause of bowel impairments in MS patients is usually either a reduced gut motility or an impairment in neurological control of defecation. The former is commonly related to inmobility or secondary effects from drugs used {{in the treatment of}} the disease. Pain <b>or</b> <b>problems</b> with defecation can be helped with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased fluid intake, oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas when habit changes and oral measures are not enough to control the problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had not had}} any mechanical {{or technical}} errors <b>or</b> <b>problems</b> prior to take-off. The turbulence and wind shear caused a crack in either the tail rudder, the tailplane, or both. This was caused by strong winds acting {{on both sides of}} the structure, due to shifting winds. These structural failures caused the aircraft to crash. Out of the 63 seconds from take-off to impact, the aircraft was under control for the first 55 seconds; only during the last 8 seconds did the crew not have control over the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|A general {{perception}} on Narayan {{was that}} he did not involve himself or his writings with the politics <b>or</b> <b>problems</b> of India, as mentioned by V. S. Naipaul in one of his columns. However, according to Wyatt Mason of The New Yorker, although Narayan's writings seem simple and display a lack of interest in politics, he delivers his narrative with an artful and deceptive technique when dealing with such subjects and does not entirely avoid them, rather letting the words play in the reader's mind. Srinivasa Iyengar, former vice-chancellor of Andhra University, says that Narayan wrote about political topics only in the context of his subjects, quite unlike his compatriot Mulk Raj Anand who dealt with the political structures and problems of the time. Paul Brians, in his book Modern South Asian Literature in English, says that the fact that Narayan completely ignored British rule and focused on the private lives of his characters is a political statement on its own, declaring his independence from the influence of colonialism.|$|E

30|$|The {{usefulness}} of simulation tools {{when combined with}} mathematical models has also been demonstrated with hybrid modeling approaches (Lee and Kim 2000). A hybrid analytical and simulation model is a mathematical model that combines identifiable analytical and simulation models. An analytical model {{is a set of}} equations that characterize a system <b>or</b> a <b>problem</b> entity, and a simulation model is a dynamic or an operating model of a system <b>or</b> <b>problem</b> entity that mimics the operating behavior of the system <b>or</b> <b>problem</b> entity. The analytical model tends to provide exact and static information, while the simulation model provides approximate and dynamic information about the system of interest <b>or</b> <b>problem</b> entity.|$|R

25|$|Most factory {{owners were}} less supportive. They {{felt that the}} lectors stirred up their {{workforce}} by fostering “radical ideas”. News of labor conditions <b>or</b> <b>problems</b> in other locations, especially, led to worker walkouts and protests on many occasions. More than one owner tried to ban lectors from his factory floor, leading to bitter strikes as his employees fought for their “right” to have a lector.|$|E

25|$|As {{climbing}} routes <b>or</b> <b>problems</b> {{increase in}} difficulty, climbers learn to develop skills {{that help them}} complete the climbs clean. There are several techniques for hands and feet as well as terms for motions that combine the two. For indoor gyms, route setters visualize and create routes for climbers, placing different kinds of holds in specific parts of the wall at particular angles because they intend climbers to use certain techniques.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequent}} root cause for diving fatalities {{is running out}} of or low on gas. Other factors cited include buoyancy control, entanglement or entrapment, rough water, equipment misuse <b>or</b> <b>problems</b> and emergency ascent. The most common injuries and causes of death were drowning or asphyxia due to inhalation of water, air embolism and cardiac events. Risk of cardiac arrest is greater for older divers, and greater for men than women, although the risks are equal by age 65.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} an isozyme is glucokinase, a variant of {{hexokinase}} which is not inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate. Its different regulatory features and lower affinity for glucose (compared to other hexokinases), allows it to serve different functions in cells of specific organs, such as control of insulin release by the beta cells of the pancreas, or initiation of glycogen synthesis by liver cells. Both of these processes must only occur when glucose is abundant, <b>or</b> <b>problems</b> occur.|$|E

25|$|The patient being {{examined}} or treated is usually awake during catheterization, ideally with only local anaesthesia such as lidocaine and minimal general sedation, throughout the procedure. Performing the procedure {{with the patient}} awake is safer as the patient can immediately report any discomfort <b>or</b> <b>problems</b> and thereby facilitate rapid correction of any undesirable events. Medical monitors fail to give a comprehensive view of the patient's immediate well-being; how the patient feels is often a most reliable indicator of procedural safety.|$|E
25|$|The Flight Control Team had {{not been}} working on any issues <b>or</b> <b>problems</b> related to the planned de-orbit and {{re-entry}} of Columbia. In particular, the team had indicated no concerns about the debris that hit the left wing during ascent, and treated the re-entry like any other. The team worked through the de-orbit preparation checklist and re-entry checklist procedures. Weather forecasters, {{with the help of}} pilots in the Shuttle Training Aircraft, evaluated landing-site weather conditions at the Kennedy Space Center.|$|E
25|$|Literally, a {{myopathy}} is {{a disease}} of the muscle tissue itself. Myo derives from the word muscle and pathos means disease. There are dozens of different myopathies, and myopathies {{are not the only}} conditions that can cause muscle weakness. Other diseases can cause weakness such as medical conditions affecting sites outside of the muscle itself, including problems in the brain (such as stroke, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis), <b>or</b> <b>problems</b> in the spinal cord and/or nerve (such as polio and spinal muscular atrophy).|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} science, concurrency is the decomposability {{property of}} a program, algorithm, <b>or</b> <b>problem</b> into order-independent <b>or</b> partially-ordered components or units. This means {{that even if}} the concurrent units of the program, algorithm, <b>or</b> <b>problem</b> are executed out-of-order or in partial order, the final outcome will remain the same. This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units, which can significantly improve overall speed of the execution in multi-processor and multi-core systems.|$|R
25|$|For women, {{problems}} with fertilisation arise mainly from either structural {{problems in the}} Fallopian tube or uterus <b>or</b> <b>problems</b> releasing eggs. Infertility {{may be caused by}} blockage of the Fallopian tube due to malformations, infections such as chlamydia and/or scar tissue. For example, endometriosis can cause infertility with the growth of endometrial tissue in the Fallopian tubes and/or around the ovaries. Endometriosis is usually more common in women in their mid-twenties and older, especially when postponed childbirth has taken place.|$|E

By depriving him of the attention capacity necessary to process undesirable thoughts, alcohol myopia can bring the drinker a sense of relief.|$|E
