50|$|Where {{a supply}} of vacuum is available, but not {{pneumatic}} power, rotary actuators have even been made to work from vacuum power. The only common instance of these was for early automatic windscreen wipers on cars up until around 1960. These used the manifold vacuum of a petrol engine to work a quarter-turn <b>oscillating</b> <b>vane</b> actuator. Such windscreen wipers worked adequately when the engine was running under light load, but they were notorious that when working hard at top speed or climbing a hill, the manifold vacuum was reduced and the wipers slowed to a crawl.|$|E
40|$|An corona {{anemometer}} which detects {{gas flow}} by {{the displacement of}} an ion beam is described, and experiments are performed using the anemometer to investigate the active control of diffusor separation by periodic forcing. The apparatus {{is applied to the}} separated flow over a rearward facing ramp. An <b>oscillating</b> <b>vane</b> is attached to the surface near the separation point. It is suggested that the enhancement in turbulent energy produced by the <b>oscillating</b> <b>vane</b> is due to drastic modification of the wake shear flow, and not to vane-produced turbulence...|$|E
40|$|The surface elastic moduli are the {{two-dimensional}} analogs of {{the elastic}} moduli in three dimensions. Experimental methods are reviewed briefly, {{and it is}} shown that Fourt's "elasticity index" for an <b>oscillating</b> <b>vane</b> or needle is dimensionally incorrect, whereas the formula proposed by Trapeznikov for an oscillating disk or ring is correct and can be derived exactly by regarding the film as an elastic annulus sheared in its own plane. A dimensionally correct formula is proposed for an oscillating needle {{as well as for}} an aperiodic needle type surface torsion pendulum. The relationships between the four two-dimensional elastic constants of homogeneous isotropic films are derived and are shown to be different from the three-dimensional formulas. The maximal value of the surface Poisson's ratio is unity instead of one half...|$|E

The tunnel test results for a dynamically scaled cable supported aeroelastic model are compared with analytical and flight data. The wind tunnel technique, which employs <b>oscillating</b> <b>vanes</b> in the tunnel throat section to generate a sinusoidally varying flow field around the model, was evaluated by use of a 1 / 30 scale model of the B- 52 E airplane. Correlation between the wind tunnel results, flight test results, and analytical predictions for response in the short period and wing first elastic modes of motion are presented...|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, Whirlpool {{developed}} a dual-action washing machine agitator that utilized the bottom {{portion of the}} shaft for the usual oscillating motion but added an upper sleeve {{that was designed to}} work as an auger. The auger propelled water and clothing downwards toward the agitator's <b>oscillating</b> <b>vanes</b> so as to produce more uniform scrubbing. Whirlpool secured three Canadian patents for this work. In the first patent, the dual agitator was powered by a drive shaft. A second patent (known as the '803 patent) substituted a clutch mechanism for the drive shaft. Both patent specifications described the agitator's vanes as being rigid. Whirlpool's third patent, known as the '734 patent, featured flexible vanes on the lower agitator instead of rigid vanes.|$|R

Aside from being an absolute instrument, the advantages of such a device are (1) simplicity, (2) the fact that it does not change the pressure when an observation is made as do many other types of gauges, and (3) the absence of a heated filament which may decompose the gas under study...|$|R
40|$|Aeroservoelasticity (ASE) is the {{interdisciplinary}} {{study of the}} interaction of structural, inertial, aerodynamic, and control loads for aircraft systems, and is inherently a nonlinear phenomenon. One {{of the goals of}} ASE research is to provide active gust load alleviation in aircraft to improve ride quality, minimize airframe fatigue, and increase performance. The goal of this research is to develop a robust aeroelastic (AE) predictive model for a wing section that represents a typical flexible wing in flight, and which will be used as a platform for developing ASE controllers. The various components of this research, including an unsteady aerodynamic module, a structural module, and a gust module, have been individually developed and validated with experiments. The experimental facility, comprising of a pitch-plunge free vibration apparatus, a real-time gust sniffing sensor, and an <b>oscillating</b> <b>vane</b> gust generator, are designed and developed at Texas A&M as test beds for current and future ASE research. Both the experiments and predictive model are used to explore nonlinear behavior of the system response. For example, the research has led to experimentally derived bifurcation diagrams depicting possible responses. The limit cycle oscillations (LCO) observed in experiments are captured by the predictive model. The AE model allows for parametric study of wing response on various system features such as nonlinear structural stiffness, nonlinear Coulomb damping, mass imbalance, and other design features. Also, the response of a wing under oncoming gusts is examined. This AE predictive model will serve as a platform to develop ASE models and controllers in future, and the experimental facility will serve as a test bed for validation of developed controllers...|$|E
40|$|A vane {{oscillating}} about a {{fixed point}} at the inlet to a two-dimensional 20 degree rearward facing ramp has proven effective in delaying the separation of a turbulent boundary layer. Measurements of the ramp surface static pressure coefficient obtained under the condition of vane oscillation and constant inlet velocity revealed that two different effects occurred with surface distance along the ramp. In {{the vicinity of the}} <b>oscillating</b> <b>vane,</b> the pressure coefficients varied as a negative function of the vane's trailing edge rms velocity; the independent variable on which the rms velocity depends are the vane's oscillation frequency and its displacement amplitude. From a point downstream of the vane to the exit of the ramp; however, the pressure coefficient varied as a more complex function of the two independent variables. That is, it was found to vary {{as a function of the}} vane's oscillation frequency throughout the entire range of frequencies covered during the test, but over only a limited range of the trailing edge displacement amplitudes covered. More specifically, the value of the pressure coefficient was independent of increases in the vane's displacement amplitude above approximately 35 inner wall units of the boundary layer. Below this specific amplitude it varied as a function of the vane's trailing edge rms velocity. This height is close to the upper limit of the buffer layer. A parametric study was made to determine the variation of the maximum static pressure recovery as a function of the vane's oscillation frequency, for several ramp inlet velocities and a constant displacement amplitude of the vane's trailing edge. The results indicate that the phenomenon producing the optimum delay of separation may be Strouhal number dependent. Corona anemometer measurements obtained in the inner wall regions of the boundary layer for the excited case reveal a large range of unsteadiness in the local velocities. These measurements imply the existence of inflections in the profiles, which provide a mechanism for resulting inviscid flow instabilities to produce turbulence in the near wall region, thereby delaying separation of the boundary layer...|$|E
40|$|A {{structural}} excitation system, {{using an}} <b>oscillating</b> canard <b>vane</b> to generate force, was {{mounted on the}} forebody of the YF- 12 A airplane. The canard vane was used to excite the airframe structural modes during flight in the subsonic, transonic, and supersonic regimes. Structural modal responses generated by the canard vane forces were measured at the flight test conditions by airframe-mounted accelerometers. Correlations of analytical and experimental aeroelastic results were made. Doublet lattice, steady state double lattice with uniform lag, Mach box, and piston theory all produced acceptable analytical aerodynamic results within the restrictions that apply to each. In general, the aerodynamic theory methods, carefully applied, were found to predict the dynamic behavior of the YF- 12 A aircraft adequately...|$|R
40|$|Improved heat {{exchanger}} performance {{is extremely important}} in air-conditioning and refrigeration systems, since it can lead directly to volume, weight, energy, and cost savings. The air-side heat transfer coefficient is the limiting factor {{for many of these}} {{heat exchanger}}s, and improvements in this heat transfer performance can yield superior heat exchangers. This research investigates a novel approach for active air-side heat transfer enhancement in offset-strip fin arrays through the use of thin, mechanically <b>oscillating</b> <b>vanes</b> placed upstream of a model offset-strip fin array. Dye-in-water flow visualization, hot-wire anemometry, thin-film heat transfer characterization, and static pressure drop experiments are performed to determine the thermal behavior of this actively enhanced heat exchanger, over a range of forcing frequency/amplitude combinations for Reynolds numbers (based on hydraulic diameter) from 450 to 1400. Flow visualization experiments reveal dramatic changes in the flow through the array for Reynolds numbers greater than 650 when the mechanical forcing is tuned to frequencies at or below the natural array vortex shedding frequency with amplitudes equal to half the thickness of the fins within the array. These flow structures are qualitatively similar to those associated with an increase in array-averaged heat transfer, as determined from previous heat transfer experiments. It is also observed that forcing above the natural array vortex-shedding frequency causes the flow structures within the array to be suppressed, returning the flow to that of the unforced case. Heat transfer characterization experiments reveal array-averaged enhancements up to 7. 6 % (+/- 4. 5 %) for Re = 1400 when forced at the fin-shedding frequency with an amplitude equal to half the fin thickness. This increase in heat transfer is accompanied by an increase in pressure drop of about 3 % (+/- 4 %), making the realized pressure drop penalties are of the order of the experimental uncertainty. Row-by-row heat transfer experiments revealed fin averaged heat transfer enhancements up to 14 %. The largest enhancements in fin-averaged heat transfer are realized for the center rows of fins of the array when forced appropriately for Re > 1200.
