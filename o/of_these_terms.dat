5|$|LARP {{has also}} been {{referred}} to as live role-playing (LRP), interactive literature, and free form role-playing. Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>terms</b> are still in common use; however, LARP has become the most commonly accepted term. It is sometimes written in lowercase, as larp. The live action in LARP is analogous to the term live action used in film and video to differentiate works with human actors from animation. Playing a LARP is often called larping, and one who does it is a larper.|$|E
5|$|Truce {{terms are}} {{recorded}} {{as having been}} used in the following circumstances; being out of breath, having a stitch, a shoelace being undone, fear of clothes being damaged, needing to go to the lavatory, checking the time, wanting to discuss or clarify rules during a fight or game, or one combatant wanting to remove their spectacles or jacket before continuing. It does not mean to surrender, although it may sometimes be used in preparation to surrendering. Truce terms are only used within a specific age group, have little currency outside that group and are by and large abandoned by the age of 10 or 11 years. However, research into early recorded use <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>terms</b> found examples of some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>terms</b> being used as a sign of surrender in battle or adult fights or quarrels as late as the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|The most {{extensive}} {{study of the}} use and incidence <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>terms</b> is that undertaken by folklorists Iona and Peter Opie in the UK in their 1959 book, The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren, which mapped the use of truce terms across England, Wales and Scotland. The Opies considered it the most important word in a schoolchild's vocabulary and one for {{which there was no}} adult equivalent. There has been little recent research in the UK but such research as there has been indicates that truce terms, including some of those prevalent in the late 1950s, are still in general use. Studies conducted since the 1970s in English speaking cultures show that truce terms are also prevalent in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States with a number of terms deriving from older terms used in the UK, but many not.|$|E
