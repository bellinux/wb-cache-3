5|$|In 1956, over 9,000 socialist and populist {{politicians}} were released from prison. A few Jewish functionaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> forces {{were brought to}} court {{in the process of}} de-Stalinization. According to Heather Laskey, it was not a coincidence that the high ranking Stalinist security officers put on trial by Gomułka were Jews. Władysław Gomułka was captured by Światło, imprisoned by Romkowski in 1951 and interrogated by both, him and Fejgin. Gomułka escaped physical torture only as a close associate of Joseph Stalin, and was released three years later. According to some sources, the categorization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> forces as a Jewish institution—as disseminated in the post-war anticommunist press at various times—was rooted in Żydokomuna: the belief that the secret police was predominantly Jewish became one of the factors contributing to the post-war view of Jews as agents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> forces.|$|E
5|$|On 8 September, II/27 was {{assaulted}} unsuccessfully by the Partisans at Matkovac. After {{the first}} week of September, most of the division's fighting power was shifted to the western boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> zone to meet Partisan incursions. The division succeeded in dislodging Partisan units from Slatna and Međeđa and allied Chetniks captured Skurgić. After relief by NDH forces, the division's fighting regiments withdrew to Brčko for rest and refit. As a result of the shift to the western area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> zone, the zone's southern area was quickly overrun by Partisan forces.

5|$|Amending the UN Charter, {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of the UN Charter, is a commonly cited possibility.

5|$|As {{far as the}} Germans were concerned, Operation Hackfleisch was a {{moderate}} success, with 227 Partisans killed and over 50 prisoners taken. It delayed, but did not prevent, the Partisans' advance into Serbia. In order to allow the 7th SS Division to pursue Partisan forces withdrawing towards central Bosnia, both I/28 and III/28 were placed {{under the command of}} that division for the period of 8–17 August 1944. During the remainder of August 1944, the rump of the division fought hard to keep the Partisans out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> zone. The Partisan 11th Krajina Division and 38th Bosnia Division quickly infiltrated into the southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> zone and the 27th East Bosnia Division crossed into the area north-west of Srebrenica and drove towards Bratunac. After a series of rapid redeployments and battalion and regimental attacks, the division scattered the 11th Krajina Division and mauled the 27th East Bosnia Division.|$|E
40|$|In 2007, <b>the</b> {{collapse}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{housing market}} and <b>the</b> developing trend <b>of</b> state court filings of class actions alleging violations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act culminated {{into a new}} type of securities litigation: state court filings of class actions alleging violations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities in general and mortgage-backed securities in particular. Thus, it became important for defendants to remove these claims to federal court. Permitting removal of such claims appears to conflict with <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act, which broadly prohibits removal of claims arising under <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act. But prohibiting removal is in tension with the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, which generally permits removal of class actions. This article considers whether <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act bars removal of class actions alleging violations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities. Part I of this article provides a background on the issue and explains <b>the</b> general framework <b>of</b> removal and <b>the</b> conflicting provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act and <b>the</b> Class Action Fairness Act. Next, Part II discusses the Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s holding in Luther v. Countrywide that <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act bars removal of a class action alleging violations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act with respect to mortgage-backed securities. Part III analyzes the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Katz v. Gerardi, in which the court disagreed with Luther and held that <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act does not bar removal of class actions that allege violations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities. Finally, Part IV analyzes and expands on <b>the</b> reasoning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Luther and Katz courts, concluding that the Seventh Circuit decided correctly that <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act does not bar removal of class actions alleging violations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to <b>the</b> {{problems}} <b>of</b> identification of factors that influence volumes and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>securities</b> market. <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article is detection and systematisation of factors of formation and realisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>securities</b> market. In <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conducted study it systemises factors of formation and realisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>securities</b> market by two groups: economic and legislatory organisational. <b>The</b> main <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic factors are: state of economic development, degree <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadow economy, level <b>of</b> savings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population, level <b>of</b> trust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population and level <b>of</b> inflation. <b>The</b> article justifies interconnection that exist between the said factors and volumes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>securities</b> market. In particular, it proves that increase <b>of</b> volumes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadow economy facilitates reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>securities</b> market, since it facilitates outflow <b>of</b> capital from <b>the</b> official sector <b>of</b> economy. Growth of unorganised savings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population, <b>the</b> volume <b>of</b> which grows proportionally to <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> distrust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population to <b>the</b> <b>securities</b> market, has {{a negative impact on}} formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>securities</b> market. Degree <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negative impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> said factors grows in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> deterioration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> macro-economic situation and growth <b>of</b> inflation. <b>The</b> legislatory organisational factors are: object, base, rates of taxation <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> trading and <b>the</b> <b>securities</b> market infrastructure. <b>The</b> article proves that low level of infrastructure development could significantly reduce <b>the</b> tax potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>securities</b> market. <b>The</b> proposed approach to <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> factors <b>of</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax potential gives a possibility to mark out, apart from de-shadowing of operations and expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> taxation base, one more direction on increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>securities</b> market, namely – attraction of free money funds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population. <b>The</b> prospect <b>of</b> further studies is development of methods of assessment of influence <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors upon dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>securities</b> market...|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} week of August 1944, the Second Panzer Army was finally ready to move to thwart the Partisan advance from Bosnia into Serbia, {{originally}} planned as Operation Rose. Renamed Operation Rübezahl (Mountain Spirit), the revamped plan required the 7th and 13th SS Divisions to form the Bosnian phase of the operation, named Operation Hackfleisch (Minced Meat). Hackfleisch aimed to drive out the Partisans occupying the area between the towns of Kladanj, Vlasenica, Sokolac and Olovo, south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> zone. The overall plan involved columns that were to force the Partisans eastwards into the pincers of the other units, thereby destroying them.|$|E

The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him.
