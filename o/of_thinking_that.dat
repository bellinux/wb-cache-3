5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm. Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> {{is characterized by a}} deep understanding of the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E
25|$|Galef popularized {{the concept}} of Straw Vulcan, the {{incorrect}} perception about rationality as a way <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> denies emotions such as love and lacks appreciations for beauty. It refers to the fictional character Mr. Spock (a half-Vulcan) in Star Trek, who is often seen as a poster child for this caricature of rationality. On the contrary, Galef argues that Mr. Spock's failure to adjust his thinking, even though he experiences that humans do not always make rational decisions, {{is a case of}} irrationality. In 2011, Galef gave a talk on this subject at Skepticon.|$|E

25|$|Reason and {{imagination}} rely on similar mental processes. Imagination {{is not only}} found in humans. Aristotle, for example, stated that phantasia (imagination: that which can hold images or phantasmata) and phronein (a type <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> can judge and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals. According to him, both {{are related to the}} primary perceptive ability of animals, which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order {{of the things that are}} perceived without distinguishing universals, and without deliberation or logos. But this is not yet reason, because human imagination is different.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} novel, The Writing on the Wall, an anti-war {{novel and}} roman à clef {{based on a}} possible John McCain presidency in 2008, warns against war with Iran by portraying a worst-case scenario of its outcomes. In it, author Hannes Artens portrays a global depression {{as a result of}} the oil price shooting past $140 per barrel and depicts the falsity <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> limited aerial strikes on Iran will end the problem. The story shows them eventually leading to a ground invasion and a military draft in the United States. The book ends with the Iran war escalating into a conflagration seizing the entire Middle East and ultimately culminates in a nuclear showdown between Pakistan and India after an Islamist coup in Pakistan.|$|E

Two months earlier, series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey revealed Jenna's plot to Entertainment Weekly, but did not divulged Franco's name. In an April 2010 interview with Zap2it, Carlock revealed that [...] "one of the things" [...] the staff looked forward to in the fourth season was Jenna's storyline here, and said her [...] "emotional realization" [...] that she wants more than a fake relationship with Franco was [...] "a cool turn for that character after three years <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> all she wants is to have her picture in the paper and have her hair look good." ...|$|E
500|$|Fleetwood Mac's main writers—Buckingham, Christine McVie and Nicks—worked {{individually}} {{on specific}} songs, but sometimes shared lyrics with each other. [...] "The Chain" [...] {{is the only}} track that all members, including Fleetwood and John McVie, collaborated on. All songs on Rumours concern personal, often troubled, relationships. According to Christine McVie, {{the fact that the}} lyricists were extensively focusing on the various separations became apparent to the band only with hindsight. [...] "You Make Loving Fun" [...] is about her boyfriend, Fleetwood Mac's lighting director, after she split from John. Nicks' [...] "Dreams" [...] details a breakup and has a hopeful message, while Buckingham's similar effort in [...] "Go Your Own Way" [...] is more pessimistic. After a short fling with a New England woman, he was inspired to write [...] "Never Going Back Again", a song about the illusion <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> sadness will never occur again once feeling content with life. The lines [...] "Been down one time/Been down two times" [...] are in reference to the lyricist's efforts when persuading the woman to give him a chance.|$|E

500|$|The {{placement}} of carrel spaces at the periphery {{was the product}} <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> began years earlier when Kahn submitted proposals for a new library at Washington University. There he dispensed with the traditional arrangement of completely separate library spaces for books and readers, usually with book stacks {{on the periphery of}} the library and reading rooms toward the center. [...] Instead he felt that reading spaces should be near the books and also to natural light. For Kahn, the essence of a library was the act of taking a book from a shelf and walking a few steps to a window for a closer look: [...] "A man with a book goes to the light. [...] A library begins that way. [...] He will not go fifty feet away to an electric light." [...] Each carrel area is associated with two levels of book stacks, with the upper level structured as a mezzanine that overlooks the carrels. [...] The book stacks also look out into the atrium.|$|E
500|$|In {{an unconstitutional}} though {{widespread}} practice during the Communist witchhunts, the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen's passport. This, and {{his inability to}} find work, brought Rossen, like his friend, ex-Communist Elia Kazan, back to the committee in May 1953, where he named 57 people as Communists. [...] He explained to the committee why he chose to testify: [...] "I don't think, after two years <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> <b>that</b> any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation." [...] Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father's decision: [...] "It killed him not to work. He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk, and he didn't know what to do. What I {{think he wanted to}} know was, what would I think of him if he talked? He didn't say it in that way, though. Then he explained to me the politics of it—how the studios were in on it, and there was never any chance of his working. He was under pressure, he was sick, his diabetes was bad, and he was drinking. By this time I understood that he had refused to talk before and had done his time, from my point of view. What could any kid say at that point? You say, 'I love you and I'm behind you.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Mario Bros. {{was created}} by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi, two of the lead {{developers}} for the video game Donkey Kong. In Donkey Kong, Mario dies if he falls too far. Yokoi suggested to Miyamoto {{that he should be}} able to fall from any height, which Miyamoto was not sure <b>of,</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> it would make it [...] "not much of a game." [...] He eventually agreed, thinking it would be okay for him to have some superhuman abilities. He designed a prototype that had Mario [...] "jumping and bouncing around", which he was satisfied with. The element of combating enemies from below was introduced after Yokoi suggested it, observing that it would work since there were multiple floors. However, it proved to be too easy to eliminate enemies this way, which the developers fixed by requiring players to touch the enemies after they've been flipped to defeat them. This was also how they introduced the turtle as an enemy, which they conceived as an enemy that could only be hit from below. Because of Mario's appearance in Donkey Kong with overalls, a hat, and a thick moustache, Shigeru Miyamoto thought that he should be a plumber as opposed to a carpenter, and designed this game to reflect that. Another contributing factor was the game's setting: it was a large network of giant pipes, so they felt a change in occupation was necessary for him.|$|E

500|$|The Italian critic Franco Moretti {{argued that}} Austen's novels {{articulated}} {{a new form}} of English nationalism via the marriage plot, noting most of the heroes and heroines came from different parts of England. Some critics such as Roger Gard have seized upon Austen as a symbol of an [...] "eternal England", whose [...] "unpolitical" [...] works unlike the [...] "political" [...] novels of the great French and Russian novelists of the 19th century reflected the central values of [...] "modern Anglo-Saxon civilisations". According to Gard, Austen is so English that only the English could really appreciate Austen, writing [...] "Foreigners, whether reading in translation or in the original, see little or nothing of her true brilliance...the feel of Jane Austen-so far as we can imagine it dissociated it from her language is still...peculiarly English". Irvine wrote that Gard's book 1992 book Jane Austen's Novels: The Art of Clarity is full of historical errors such as his claim Austen was part of the movement towards [...] "an evolving national democracy", when in fact the Great Reform Bill, which lowered the franchise requirements for men in a very limited way, was passed in 1832, 15 years after Austen's death, and [...] "nowhere in her novels or letters is England imagined as 'evolving' towards democracy of any kind". Irvine wrote that while Austen did see England as {{different from the rest of}} Europe, she did not see England as apart from Europe in the way that Gard claimed or as a part of [...] "Anglo-Saxon civilisations", which apparently include the United States and English-speaking parts of the Commonwealth, a way <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> did not exist in her time. Irvine charged that Gard appeared to be trying to use Austen as a way of furthering his opposition to British membership in the European Union, with his dichotomy between Austen's England with its [...] "clear" [...] style and [...] "unpolitical" [...] way of life vs. the presumably muddled style and [...] "political" [...] way of life of continental Europe with the implication that the two do not belong together.|$|E
