40|$|In {{view of the}} Segal {{construction}} {{each category}} with a coherent operation {{gives rise to a}} cohomology theory. Similarly each <b>open</b> <b>stable</b> differential relation R imposed on smooth maps of manifolds determines cohomology theories k^* and h^*; the cohomology theory k^* describes invariants of solutions of R, while h^* describes invariants of so-called stable formal solutions of R. We prove the bordism version of the h-principle: The cohomology theories k^* and h^* are equivalent for a fairly arbitrary <b>open</b> <b>stable</b> differential relation R. Furthermore, we determine the homotopy type of h^*. Thus, we show that for a fairly arbitrary <b>open</b> <b>stable</b> differential relation R, the machinery of stable homotopy theory can be applied to perform explicit computations and determine invariants of solutions. In the case of the differential relation whose solutions are all maps, our construction amounts to the Pontrjagin-Thom construction. In the case of the covering differential relation our result is equivalent to the Barratt-Priddy-Quillen theorem asserting that the direct limit of classifying spaces BΣ_n of permutation groups Σ_n of finite sets of n elements is homology equivalent to each path component of the infinite loop space Ω^∞S^∞. In the case of the submersion differential relation imposed on maps of dimension d= 2 the cohomology theories k^* and h^* are not equivalent. Nevertheless, our methods still apply and can be used to recover the Madsen-Weiss theorem (the Mumford Conjecture). Comment: 58 pages, 15 figure...|$|E

40|$|One {{finding of}} {{research}} on subjectively estimated intelligence is that women tend to provide lower estimates of general, mathematical, and spatial ability but higher estimates of interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence than men. Given that personality variables {{have been shown to}} affect such estimates, this study explored the possibility that one reason for the sex differences may be male-female differences in personality and especially in neuroticism/emotional stability. Internet questionnaires were used to obtain personality data and intelligence estimates for 379 people. Analyses showed that while neuroticism was negatively associated with intelligence estimates, it did not completely account for the gender differences. Factor analysis revealed two factors labelled artistic/emotional and academic intelligence. Openness and Extraversion predicted the first factor while academic intelligence was predicted by seven variables and accounted for just over a quarter of the variance. <b>Open,</b> <b>stable,</b> disagreeable, introverted males who had IQ test experience and believed in IQ test validity gave themselves higher scores...|$|E

The size of pores opened by either fifty 60 -ns EP (~ 13 kV/cm) or five, 600 -ns EP (~ 6 kV/cm) in GH 3 cells was estimated by isoosmotic replacement of bath NaCl with polyethylene glycols and sugars. Such replacement reduced cell swelling or resulted in transient or sustained cell shrinking in response to EP. depending on the availability of pores permeable to the test solute. Unexpectedly, solute substitutions showed that for the same integral area of pores opened by 60 - and 600 -ns treatments (as estimated by cell volume changes), the pore sizes were similar. However, the 600 -ns exposure triggered significantly higher cell uptake of propidium. We concluded that 600 -ns EP opened a greater number of larger (propidium-permeable pores), but the fraction of the larger pores in the entire pore population was insufficient to contribute to cell volume changes. For both the 60 - and 600 -ns exposures, cell volume changes were determined by pores smaller than 0. 9 nm in diameter; however, the diameter increased with increasing the nsEP intensity...|$|E
40|$|Northern {{elephant}} seal (Mirounga angustirostris) pups maintain a paradoxical fasting hyperglycemia while fasting for 6 – 8 weeks after nursing ~ 30 days. The hyperglycemia results from {{low rates of}} glucose utilization (due to low insulin) and high rates of glucose carbon recycling. Fatty acids are the major energy substrate during this time, with high rates of palmitate turnover and low ketone levels, as well as nitrogen conservation and low urea turnover.

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix were determined. The initial conceptualization, where carbon atoms left the model, yielded nonzero negative eigenvalues, indicating an <b>open,</b> <b>stable</b> system. Inclusion of a sink which accumulated carbon atoms yielded the same set of negative eigenvalues, and a zero eigenvalue, indicating that this system was closed and stable. The trace (β) of the matrix was a negative real number in both cases, while the determinant () of the matrix was a negative real number in the first case (no sink), and zero in the second case (sink), indicating that the system lies near a stable saddle point in the dimensionless β- phase-plane.

40|$|Morphological {{changes of}} liposomes caused by {{interactions}} between liposomal membranes and talin, a cytoskeletal submembranous protein, were studied by direct, real-time observation by using high-intensity dark-field microscopy. Surprisingly, when talin {{was added to}} a liposome solution, liposomes <b>opened</b> <b>stable</b> holes and were transformed into cup-shaped liposomes. The holes became larger with increasing talin concentration, and finally the cup-shaped liposomes were transformed into lipid bilayer sheets. These morphological changes were reversed by protein dilution, i. e., the sheets could be transformed back into closed spherical liposomes. We demonstrated that talin was localized mainly along the membrane verges, presumably avoiding exposure of its hydrophobic portion {{at the edge of}} the lipid bilayer. This is the first demonstration that a lipid bilayer can stably maintain a free verge in aqueous solution. This finding refutes the established dogma that all lipid bilayer membranes inevitably form closed vesicles and suggests that talin is a useful tool for manipulating liposomes...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the multisegmental static postural balance of active eutrophic and obese elderly women using a three-dimensional system under different sensory conditions. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 31 elderly women (16 eutrophic and 15 obese) aged 65 to 75 years. The following anthropometric measurements were obtained: weight, height, waist and hip circumference, and handgrip strength. The physical activity level was evaluated using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Body composition was measured using the deuterium oxide dilution technique. The Polhemus (R) Patriot (three-dimensional) equipment was used to measure the parameters of postural balance along the anteroposterior and laterolateral axes. The data acquisition involved one trial of 60 s to test the limit of stability and four trials of 90 s each under the following conditions: (1) eyes <b>open,</b> <b>stable</b> surface; (2) eyes closed, stable surface; (3) eyes open, unstable surface; and (4) eyes closed, unstable surface. RESULTS: For the limit of stability, significant differences were observed in the maximum anteroposterior and laterolateral displacement (p< 0. 01) and in the parameter maximum anteroposterior displacement in the eyes closed stable surface condition (p< 0. 01) and maximum anteroposterior and laterolateral displacement in the eyes open unstable surface (p< 0. 01 and p = 0. 03) and eyes closed unstable surface (p< 0. 01 and p< 0. 01) conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Obese elderly women exhibited a lower stability limit (lower sway area) compared with eutrophic women, leaving them more vulnerable to falls. FAEPACAPE...|$|E

40|$|<b>Open</b> <b>stable</b> {{systems with}} outdoor yards {{are used in}} organic cattle farming. Until now there are no {{emission}} factors in Germany for outdoor yards of dairy barns or of cattle barns generally. The measuring of the emission potential of gaseous substances (NH 3, CO 2, N 2 O and CH 4) is difficult {{because of the size}} of the outdoor yards and the direct access by climate. One possibility to measure those emissions is the use of an active sampling hood. The sampling hood provides defined laminar exhaust airflow. The product of flow rate and concentration results in the emission mass flow. In a preliminary study six cattle in calf with a total of 7. 19 GV had access to an outdoor yard. This was divided virtually in a 9 x 11 à 1 m² grid. To each m² a dirt level (clean, slightly, medium and heavily soiled) has been assigned. The grid area was sampled randomly. The influence of a scraper was investigated, too. The levels of dirtiness were allocated to the NH 3 emission mass flows. Based on the rating the results of the random samples were transferred on the partial area of the entire outdoor yard. The outcome of this is an emission factor for NH 3 of 3. 02 kg/GV*a for the outdoor yard before the scraper was used and 2. 79 kg/GV*a afterwards. The preliminary results show that measuring NH 3 emissions by an active sampling hood is practicable for the use at outdoor yards of cattle barns...|$|E
