25|$|The {{question}} rounds {{consist of}} a series of 5 aimed at one team only. Players are given five seconds to answer, or longer for a spelling question, and may confer amongst themselves before giving an answer. If two students answer differently at once, the team captain is asked to select <b>one</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The lad waxed mighty {{with the}} years; he grew {{at last to}} beAcadia's first graduate, in Eighteen-forty-three.A surgeon he became in time, and served with hand and brainThroughout the bloody Civil War and all its wild campaign.When {{questioned}} how he kept so cool, <b>one</b> <b>answer</b> would suffice:He'd say he got it from his dad, who braved the Minas ice.|$|E
25|$|Unger's {{philosophical}} work grapples {{with some}} of the most fundamental and enduring problems of human existence. It has been put into direct dialogue with Kant's moral law, and said to have provided <b>one</b> <b>answer</b> to Hume's Guillotine. Unger's analysis of liberalism and the philosophical program he builds around rethinking the individual has also inspired new thinking and approaches to psychiatry.|$|E
60|$|No <b>one</b> <b>answered,</b> for the mighty-chested Zulu {{looked very}} formidable.|$|R
60|$|At {{the latter}} {{question}} I trembled, but fortunately no <b>one</b> <b>answered.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} {{interval}} before any <b>one</b> <b>answered</b> this surprising question.|$|R
25|$|The {{book was}} {{critically}} hailed as successfully grappling {{with some of}} the most fundamental and enduring problems of human existence. It has been put into direct dialogue with Kant's moral law, and said to have provided <b>one</b> <b>answer</b> to Hume's Guillotine. Unger's analysis and the program he builds around this revolutionary understanding has also inspired new thinking and approaches to psychiatry.|$|E
25|$|Jungians have {{emphasised}} {{the power}} of parent hunger, forcing one repeatedly to seek out unactualised parts of the father archetype in the outside world. <b>One</b> <b>answer</b> men have been offered is to move into generativity; to find the lost father within themselves, the internal father, and hand him on to their successors, thereby shifting from demanding parental guidance to providing it.|$|E
25|$|The {{helicopter}} shot has likely {{emerged as}} a popular stroke in recent years {{because of the need}} to maximize run-scoring in limited overs cricket, particularly Twenty20 matches. It was started by Muhammad Azharuddin. Traditionally, faster bowlers have used yorker-length deliveries toward the end of limited-overs matches because it is difficult to send such balls to the boundary. The helicopter shot is <b>one</b> <b>answer</b> to this tactic.|$|E
60|$|No <b>one</b> <b>answered</b> that in words, but {{the answer}} was there, in dark faces.|$|R
60|$|No <b>one</b> <b>answered,</b> and {{presently}} {{they all}} looked blankly {{from one to the}} other.|$|R
5000|$|Trust the Crowd - The <b>One's</b> <b>answer</b> becomes {{whatever}} {{the majority of}} The Crowd answered.|$|R
25|$|Roy's Top Ten – Roy Bellamy {{performs}} {{this list}} {{on a regular}} basis, and the humor of the segment is multi-faceted. Part of it is derived from Bellamy's sometime mangling of the delivery, part is the often uproarious laughter from Stugotz, but the underlying, veiled theme is that nine of the ten {{on the list is}} Afrocentric in nature, and the number <b>one</b> <b>answer</b> is always Caucasian in nature. Written by Roy and producer Mike Ryan, and previously former producer and co-host Marc Hochman, the list is always subject to being misconstrued by a casual listener as racist, but the show's (and Le Batard's) racial color-blindness allows for a lot of latitude in this regard.|$|E
25|$|It {{was very}} slow and {{therefore}} a most impressive assault with steel. At times the tanks almost 'stood on their heads', twisting to avoid mounds of rock and to get {{at right angles to}} the huge cracks and shell holes, but always getting nearer and nearer. Like beetles trying to climb an inverted ice-cream cone, they slipped a little, hung suspended and then went onwards towards the top. The behaviour of these tanks upset the Germans. Such tactics were untanklike, and no answer was contained in their military textbooks. Too late now to shift the anti-tank guns from their positions, too late to make alternative arrangements to deal with the new menace. There was only <b>one</b> <b>answer</b> – retreat, and that's what the Germans did – leaving the British tanks and infantry in possession of the first slope up the heights of Longstop. So ended 23 April.|$|E
25|$|There is no <b>one</b> <b>answer</b> {{from modern}} science to give. What the {{original}} question now means indeed depends on choosing genus or {{species in the}} required answer. It is thought that the genus of man {{has been around for}} ten times as long as our species. Currently, fresh examples of (extinct) species of the genus Homo are still being discovered, so that definitive answers are not available. The consensus view is that human beings are one species, the only existing species of the genus. With the rejection of polygenism for human origins, it is asserted that this species had a definite and single origin in the past. (That assertion leaves aside the point whether the origin meant is of the current species, however. The multiregional hypothesis allows the origin to be otherwise.) The hypothesis of recent African origin of modern humans is now widely accepted, and states that anatomically modern humans had a single origin, in Africa.|$|E
60|$|No <b>one</b> <b>answered</b> this remark. Yet {{he failed}} {{to see how it}} applied to him.|$|R
50|$|Ask the answerers (询问答人): <b>One</b> answerer who <b>answered</b> {{correctly}} and <b>one</b> who <b>answered</b> incorrectly are chosen at random. Each explains {{their decision to}} the contestant. This automatically eliminates <b>one</b> wrong <b>answer.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{looked from}} one to another of those who stood silently around, but no <b>one</b> <b>answered.</b>|$|R
25|$|At the time, much of Calabria {{was a wild}} place. The 1783 Calabrian {{earthquakes}} killed 100,000 people. Parts of Reggio {{still lay}} in ruins as late as 1813 and many churches had not been rebuilt in 1806. The hardy Calabrians had a strong independent streak and practiced the vendetta against neighboring families and villages. Plundering French troops and greedy French civil authorities quickly ignited a revolt by the proud Calabrian peasants. However, {{the people of the}} major towns hated the Neapolitan royal administration and generally favored the French. The rebellion flared up after individual events. At Scigliano the French left a detail of 50 soldiers. A woman was raped, the villagers rose up, and most of the Frenchmen were slaughtered. The French commanders had only <b>one</b> <b>answer</b> to such incidents, to attack, plunder, and burn down the offending village. This led to a vicious cycle of atrocity and counter-atrocity. For his part, Joseph Bonaparte tried to be fair, even ordering French soldiers to be shot for criminal offenses and French officials to be tried for malfeasance.|$|E
500|$|In a 1971 {{letter to}} Paul McCartney, Lennon wrote, [...] "When {{people ask me}} {{questions}} about 'What did George Martin really do for you?,' I have only <b>one</b> <b>answer,</b> 'What does he do now?' I noticed you had no answer for that! It's not a putdown, it's the truth." [...] Lennon wrote that Martin took too much credit for the Beatles' music. Commenting specifically on [...] "Revolution 9", Lennon said with ironic authority, [...] "For Martin to state that he was 'painting a sound picture' is pure hallucination. Ask {{any of the other}} people involved. The final editing Yoko and I did alone." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the third}} round (entitled [...] "The Male Order"), each contestant, {{starting}} with the current leader (or the winner of a pre-show coin toss, {{in case of a}} tie), is given one question, and may choose any panelist to assist them on the question. For the Male Order question, the contestant is asked to rank the three answers from most popular to least popular. Although the panelist will give their opinion as to the correct ranking, the contestant has the final decision. The contestant picks up $100 for <b>one</b> <b>answer</b> correctly ranked, or $500 for all three.|$|E
60|$|No <b>one</b> <b>answered</b> him. Even Quest {{had barely}} yet {{recovered}} himself. The Professor shrugged his shoulders.|$|R
60|$|No <b>one</b> <b>answered</b> him. Hefferom {{stood as}} though turned to stone, {{but his eyes}} never left Deane's.|$|R
5000|$|A bailiff {{comes to}} the family home to recover a debt of 20,000 euros, but no <b>one</b> <b>answers</b> the door.|$|R
500|$|A Reuleaux {{triangle}} [...] is a shape {{formed from}} {{the intersection of}} three circular disks, each having its center on the boundary of the other two. Its boundary is a curve of constant width, the simplest and best known such curve other than the circle itself. Constant width means that the separation of every two parallel supporting lines is the same, independent of their orientation. Because all its diameters are the same, the Reuleaux triangle is <b>one</b> <b>answer</b> to the question [...] "Other than a circle, what shape can a manhole cover be made so that it cannot fall down through the hole?" ...|$|E
500|$|The fourth round {{is titled}} the [...] "Men's High Five" [...] {{and is an}} {{open-ended}} question asked to 200 men. The top five answers are placed on the board in a random order, and the panel again gives their opinion on {{what would be the}} most popular answer. If the score going into this question is tied, each contestant is allowed to select <b>one</b> <b>answer,</b> with the winner of the pre-show coin toss deciding who makes the first selection. If one contestant has the lead, that contestant goes first and is given a selection; her opponent is then allowed one provided the first contestant did not pick the most popular answer. If the most popular answer has not yet been revealed, the first contestant is given one more selection. The contestant who selects the highest-ranked answer wins the game, keeps her money, and plays the bonus round.|$|E
2500|$|A {{review of}} the second edition of The Guide to Science was {{published}} by Punch magazine in 1850. The book was seen to be a [...] "very useful little work". However, in typical Punch satirical style, the reviewer disagreed with <b>one</b> <b>answer</b> that we [...] "feel a desire for activity in cold weather" [...] due to [...] "fanning combustion in the blood" [...] by instead insisting that we feel a desire [...] "to sit cosily over a fire in cold weather".|$|E
60|$|No <b>one</b> <b>answered</b> his question, and in {{a whisper}} I {{repeated}} it to Sergeant Corney, whereupon {{he shook his head}} decidedly.|$|R
60|$|No <b>one</b> <b>answered.</b> But a heavy {{piece of}} the adobe wall fell with a thud. Duane heard it crack, felt it shake.|$|R
60|$|Kaliko {{went to the}} big gong {{and pounded}} on it just as Ruggedo used to do; but no <b>one</b> <b>answered</b> the summons.|$|R
2500|$|The 2001 Australian census results {{indicate}} that many Australians claim some European heritage: English37%, [...] Irish11%, Italian5%, German4.3%, Scottish3%, Greek2%, Former Yugoslav1.8%, Dutch1.5%, Polish0.9%. Australians of some non-European origin form a significant but still relatively {{small part of the}} population: Chinese3.2%, [...] Indian0.9%, Lebanese0.9%, Vietnamese0.9%. About 2.2% identified themselves as Indigenous Australians. 39% of the population gave their ancestry as [...] "Australian". [...] The Australian census does not classify people according to race, only ethnic ancestry. (Note that subjects were permitted to select more than <b>one</b> <b>answer</b> for this census question.) ...|$|E
2500|$|News of the {{ultimatum}} reached London {{on the day}} it expired. Outrage {{and laughter}} were the main responses. The editor of the Times laughed out loud when he read it, saying 'an official document is seldom amusing and useful yet this was both.' The Times denounced the ultimatum as an 'extravagant farce.' The Globe denounced this 'trumpery little state.' Most editorials were similar to the Daily Telegraph, which declared: 'of course there can only be <b>one</b> <b>answer</b> to this grotesque challenge. Kruger has asked for war and war he must have!' ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{family with}} {{control of the}} {{question}} then tries to win the round by guessing all of the remaining concealed answers, with each member giving <b>one</b> <b>answer</b> in sequence. Giving an answer not on the board, or failing to respond within the allotted time, earns one strike. If the family earns three strikes, their opponents are given one chance to [...] "steal" [...] the points for the round by guessing any remaining concealed answer; failing to do so awards the points back to the family that originally had control. Any answers on the board {{that have not been}} guessed are then revealed.|$|E
60|$|As no <b>one</b> <b>answered,</b> {{he paused}} in the upper hallway and asked the {{question}} again. Then he looked into one dormitory after another.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right, Algy," [...] said <b>one,</b> <b>answering</b> for the others; [...] "we'll {{have that}} dance if we die for it--ev'ry man Jack of us." ...|$|R
5000|$|... that <b>one</b> <b>answers</b> [...] "with {{scientific}} demonstrations {{to those}} who scorn the archaic character of the lexicology, phonetic and syntax of popular French in America"; ...|$|R
