The Cordillera de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene–Quaternary age. During the Miocene-Pleistocene, the isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water-poor and unoxidized petrologies. This finding is consistent with a hot mantle forming after delamination of the crust and migration of the arc.|$|E

The K2 Gneiss consists of a mixture of <b>orthogneiss</b> and biotite-rich paragneiss. On the south and southeast face of K2, the <b>orthogneiss</b> consists of a mixture of a strongly foliated plagioclase-hornblende gneiss and a biotite-hornblende-K-feldspar <b>orthogneiss,</b> which has been intruded by garnet-mica leucogranitic dikes. In places, the paragneisses include clinopyroxene-hornblende-bearing psammites, garnet (grossular)-diopside marbles, and biotite-graphite phyllites. Near the memorial to the climbers, who have died on K2, above Base Camp on the south spur, thin impure marbles with quartzites and mica schists, called the Gilkey-Puchoz sequence, are interbanded within the orthogneisses. On the west face of Broad Peak and south spur of K2, lamprophyre dikes, which consist of clinopyroxene and biotite-porphyritic vogesites and minettes, have intruded the K2 gneiss. The K2 Gneiss is separated from the surrounding sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks of the surrounding Karakoram Metamorphic Complex by normal faults. For example, a fault separates the K2 gneiss of the east face of K2 from limestones and slates comprising nearby Skyang Kangri.|$|E

Garnet-mica schists of the Pan-African basement are intruded by the protoliths of <b>orthogneisses</b> and Triassic leucocratic <b>orthogneisses.</b> This study focuses on the geochronology and geochemistry of <b>orthogneisses</b> related to the Pan-African evolution of the Menderes Massif in latest Proterozoic time. Geochemical data suggest that the <b>orthogneisses</b> were derived from S-type, peraluminous, syn- to post-collisional granitoids of calc-alkaline affinity. Zircon grains from the <b>orthogneisses,</b> which are euhedral with typical igneous morphologies, were dated by the Pb-Pb evaporation method. Single zircon ages of two samples yielded 207 Pb/ 206 Pb ages of 561. 5 – 1. 8 Ma and 570. 5 – 2. 2 Ma. These ages are interpreted as the time of protolith emplacement of the <b>orthogneisses.</b> This major magmatic episode of the Menderes Massif can be attributed the Pan-African Orogeny which was related to the closure of the ocean basins and amalgamation of East and West Gondwana...|$|R
40|$|<b>Orthogneisses</b> {{derived from}} granitoids with Variscan protolith ages {{dominate}} the lower unit of high-grade metamorphic {{basement of the}} Eastern Rhodope Massif in south Bulgaria. We present whole-rock geochemistry and Sr–Pb isotopic composition of these <b>orthogneisses,</b> which are compared with Pb isotopes of parametamorphic rocks, and hydrothermal ore deposits and associated rocks, to better constrain their composition, origin, and contribution to late Alpine hydrothermal processes. The igneous mineral assemblage is partly preserved, and the field textures and microstructures of the <b>orthogneisses</b> are consistent with a ductile, amphibolite-grade tectono-metamorphic overprint during Alpine time, when {{they were involved in}} the metamorphic nappe stack. Whole-rock geochemistry revealed compositions of the <b>orthogneisses</b> largely unaffected by the amphibolite-grade metamorphism, displaying a magmatic differentiation trend of the igneous protoliths. The protoliths are peraluminous medium-K calcalkaline S-type granitoids, whose tectono-magmatic setting discrimination consistently indicates a continental volcanic arc origin. The <b>orthogneisses</b> present trace element and rare-earth elements (REE) patterns based on which a group of high-field strength elements-depleted and REE fractionated <b>orthogneisses</b> and a group of LREE-enriched <b>orthogneisses</b> can be distinguished. Both geochemical groups show compositions similar to the bulk and upper continental crust and its sedimentary counterparts. Crustal Pb isotope ratios (206 Pb/ 204 Pbi 518. 24 – 18. 66) of the <b>orthogneisses</b> are comparable to the paragneisses (206 Pb/ 204 Pbi 518. 31 – 18. 93) and uniform in both (207 Pb/ 204 Pbi 515. 64 – 15. 72) and 208 Pb/ 204 Pbi ratios in the paragneisses (38. 23 – 38. 60) and the <b>orthogneisses</b> (38. 32 – 38. 56). The trace element data and 87 Sr/ 86 Sri isotopes of the <b>orthogneisses</b> (0. 7050 – 0. 7117) overlap those of the parametamorphic rocks (0. 7039 – 0. 7144), and confirm the supracrustal origin of the igneous precursors. A heterogeneous crustal source region is suggested in which melting and crustal contamination during magma genesis with subsequent fractional crystallization was involved in the petrogenesis. Comparative Pb isotope systematics suggests that a significant crustal Pb input to ore-forming hydrothermal fluids was derived primarily from the metamorphic basement, implying that the brittlly deformed basement during crustal extension acted as an immediate environment for fluid leaching during late Alpine hydrothermal ore-forming processes...|$|R
40|$|In the Ligurian Alps, the Barbassiria massif (a Variscan {{basement}} {{unit of the}} Briançonnais domain) {{is made up of}} <b>orthogneisses</b> {{derived from}} K-rich rhyolite protoliths and minor rhyolite dykes. However, on account of subsequent Alpine deformation and a related blueschist facies metamorphic overprint that are pervasive within the Barbassiria <b>Orthogneisses,</b> little evidence of the earlier Variscan metamorphism is preserved. In this study, new U–Pb laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (LA–ICP–MS) dating of zircon from the Barbassiria <b>Orthogneisses</b> and dykes was undertaken to unravel the relationships between protolith magmatism and the Variscan metamorphic overprint. The results suggest a protolith age for the Barbassiria <b>Orthogneisses</b> of ~ 315 – 320 Ma (i. e., Early/Late Carboniferous), and constrain the age of a subsequent rhyolite dyke emplacement event to 260. 23. 1 Ma (i. e., Late Permian). The Variscan high-temperature (greenschist–amphibolite facies) metamorphic event that affected the Barbassiria <b>Orthogneisses</b> was likely associated with both tectonic burial and compression during the final stages of the Variscan collision during the Late Carboniferous period. Emplacement of late-stage rhyolite dykes that cut the Barbassiria <b>Orthogneisses</b> is linked to a diffuse episode of Late Permian rhyolite volcanism that is commonly observed in the Ligurian Alps.

40|$|Metagranitic <b>orthogneisses</b> are {{abundant}} in the Central Iberian Zone (CIZ). This felsic magmatism has a highly peraluminous composition (A/CNK = 1. 07 - 1. 62) defining a typical S-type granite character, common in crustal thickening environments. The studied Spanish Central System (SCS) <b>orthogneisses</b> yield Late Cambrian to Early Ordovician U-Pb zircon ages (496 to 481 Ma), overlapping with the available literature data (mostly from 477 to 500 Ma). These <b>orthogneisses</b> are intrusive into metasedimentary sequences from the northern CIZ that have been recently dated at about 536 Ma. Late Ediacaran inherited zircons are common in the SCS <b>orthogneisses</b> (10 % to 75 % of the total zircon population). Most inheritance ranges from Neoproterozoic to Late Mesoproterozoic in age (0. 52 to 1. 25 Ga) and shows marked positive [U+ 0510]Hft values (>+ 5). This long period of Proterozoic juvenile input is only recognized in the metasedimentary rocks of the Schist-Greywacke Complex, outcropping in the southern CIZ. The proposed linkage between the southern CIZ metasediments (as sources) and the studied <b>orthogneisses</b> is reinforced by their similar Nd isotopic signatures (from - 2. 81 to - 4. 95) and the highly peraluminous character of the <b>orthogneisses.</b> The intrusion of this felsic magmatism within the northern CIZ, having been generated by melting of the more distal southern CIZ metasediments, together with their recycled crustal origin, suggests crustal thickening of the northern Gondwana margin {{during a period of}} flat subduction. The <b>orthogneisses</b> define a large linear S-type magmatic belt cropping out for over 650 km from central Spain to Galicia. The ~ 35 Ma delay between sedimentation and granite intrusion is a typical time interval for crustal thickening models. This thickening stage evolved toward a passive margin setting, allowing the deposition of the siliciclastic Ordovician series which covered the previous terranes. Minor Floian-aged tholeiitic magmatism, giving rise to scarce metabasite outcrops in the SCS, probably postdates thickening and marks this tectonic change in central Iberia. 24 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Session T 9 - Reconstruction of East Asian Blocks in Pangea: paper no. 238 - 11 Located in {{the middle}} segment of the {{southern}} margin of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), the Beishan belt in northwestern China plays {{a pivotal role in}} understanding the tectonic evolution of the CAOB. Despite numerous studies primarily emphasizing on Phanerozoic events, the Precambrian evolution of the Beishan belt has been poorly constrained, and whether there is any Precambrian basement in the belt still remains controversial. Here we report new geochemical and zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic data from the <b>orthogneisses</b> in the Beishan belt and adjacent Central Tianshan Block to shed a light on above problems. LA-ICPMS U-Pb dating of zircons reveals the protoliths of the Gubaoquan <b>orthogneisses</b> in the Beishan belt crystallized at ~ 900 Ma and the Xingxingxia <b>orthogneisses</b> in the Central Tianshan Orogen formed at ~ 878 Ma. These <b>orthogneisses</b> show similar zircon Hf-isotope compositions with εHf(t) values from - 0. 91 to + 5. 29 and two-stage Hf-isotope model ages of 1. 44 to 1. 83 Ga. However, they possess different geochemical compositions, suggesting their different tectonic environments. The Gubaoquan <b>orthogneisses</b> show low Na 2 O and large ion lithophile elements (LILEs, e. g., Sr and Ba) contents with low A/CNK values (< 1), and high contents of Fe 2 O 3 t, Sc, Cr, Y and high field strength elements (HFSEs, e. g., Zr, Hf, Nb and Ta) with high Ga/Al ratios, akin to highly fractionated I-type to A-type granitoids. These features indicate that the Gubaoquan <b>orthogneisses</b> were probably generated in a post-collisional extensional setting. In contrast, the Xingxingxia <b>orthogneisses</b> exhibit relatively high SiO 2, LILEs contents, a depletion in HFSEs, and low ratios of K 2 O/Na 2 O, Rb/Sr (0. 74 - 1. 45) and Rb/Ba (0. 30 - 0. 36), which suggest that they are typical arc-related I-type granitoids formed in a subduction zone, similar to the coeval Neoproterozoic granitoids in the adjacent Tianshan Orogenic Collage and Tarim Craton. Our study confirms the occurrence of Precambrian basement in the Beishan belt and neither the Tianshan Orogenic Collage nor the Tarim Craton could be linked with the Beishan belt during Neoproterozoic time.

Here we report new geochemical and zircon U–Pb–Hf isotopic data for the Gubaoquan ortho- and parag-neisses in the BSOB and the comparable Xingxingxia <b>orthogneisses</b> in the Central Tianshan Orogenic Belt to constrain their age, petrogenesis and tectonic implications. New LA-ICPMS U–Pb zircon dating results of zircon reveal that the protoliths of the Gubaoquan <b>orthogneisses</b> crystallized at 905 – 871 Ma, while the Gubaoquan paragneisses yielded an age peak at 1040 – 910 Ma with a maximum depositional age of ∼ 871 Ma.

All the Gubaoquan and Xingxingxia <b>orthogneisses</b> show low A/CNK, Rb/Sr and Rb/Ba ratios and similar depletion of Nb, Ta and Ti, akin to I-type granitoids related to subduction. However, the former have much lower Sr contents and Sr/Y ratios, lower light to heavy rare earth element fraction-ation (LREE/HREE = 4. 43 – 10. 12), and weaker negative Eu anomalies, related to a back-arc setting at low pressures, whereas the latter formed at high pressures in a continental arc setting.

The data also show ages ranging from Neoproterozoic to Early Ordovician of the large bodies of granitic <b>orthogneisses</b> that intruded into the series at different levels. Both events represent the final stages of the Cadomian orogeny and its transition to the Variscan cycle in the Eastern Pyrenees. A Cambrian rifting event linking both cycles has not been identified in the Pyrenees to date. Our findings provide a better fit for the pre-Variscan sequences of the Pyrenees with those of the Iberian Massif and allow their comparison with other pre-Variscan massifs in Europe...|$|R
