5000|$|Previous {{findings}} <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> {{against the}} applicant: Past findings <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> make {{it unlikely that}} a withdrawal of application for admission be granted.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are special}} {{instructions}} for TPS and VAWA self-petitioners {{applying for a}} waiver of this ground <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility.</b>|$|R
5000|$|According to the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM), due to {{the lack}} of regulations, the Department of State has no {{procedures}} in effect to implement the Reed Amendment. The FAM instructs consular officers that [...] "the role of the Department and the consular officer is very limited in implementing this ground <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility.</b> Unless the applicant appears as a hit in the lookout system revealing a finding <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> under INA 212(a)(10)(E), you must assume the applicant is eligible." [...] Finally, the FAM states that a person who is found inadmissible {{due to the}} Reed Amendment could request a Waiver <b>of</b> <b>Inadmissibility</b> under INA 212(d)(3)(A) to obtain a non-immigrant visa, but that no waiver is available to obtain an immigrant visa.|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{agreed that the}} European Court of Human Rights is in crisis; a "victim of its own success", with an {{ever-increasing}} caseload and a backlog of over 18, 000 applications pending. This article critically examines various proposals for alleviating the problem, as submitted by the Working Party on Working Methods of the European Court of Human Rights. The author argues that while it is clearly necessary {{to ensure that the}} Court functions as efficiently as possible, this should not be achieved at the expense of undermining the right of individual petition. In particular it is contended that eliminating "warning letters", transferring most decisions <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> to three-judge committees, expanding the grounds <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility,</b> dispensing with giving reasons for declarations <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility,</b> avoiding fact-finding missions and pushing for friendly-settlements are all measures that undermine the very principle of democratic justice which {{lies at the heart of}} the Court's existence...|$|R
5000|$|Applicants may {{download}} Form I-601, Application for Waiver <b>of</b> Ground <b>of</b> <b>Inadmissibility</b> {{from the}} USCIS website http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=db029c7755cb9010VgnVCM10000045f3d6a1RCRD&vgnextchannel=db029c7755cb9010VgnVCM10000045f3d6a1RCRD. Depending on whether an applicant is applying for an Immigrant Visa or Adjustment of Status, Form I-601 may be filed at the consular office, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office or immigration court considering the immigrant visa or adjustment of status application. [...] Issues surrounding waivers <b>of</b> grounds <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> may be complex (including eligibility issues) {{and it is}} generally advisable to consult an attorney. The filing fee for Form I-601 is currently $930.|$|R
5000|$|Section 212(d) grounds <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> {{for reasons}} such as {{criminal}} background, past immigration violations, or association with terrorist organizations. Note that the Form I-129 petition does not check for these.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{applicant}} is inadmissible {{because they were}} a member of, or affiliated with, the Communist or any other totalitarian party, they may apply for a Waiver <b>of</b> Ground <b>of</b> <b>Inadmissibility</b> on Form I-601.|$|R
5000|$|Persons who knowingly or willfully made misrepresentations or {{committed}} {{fraud in}} order to obtain an immigration benefit or benefit under the INA, may apply for a Waiver <b>of</b> Ground <b>of</b> <b>Inadmissibility</b> on Form I-601.|$|R
50|$|All {{the other}} usual {{requirements}} needed {{to obtain a}} nonimmigrant visa continue to apply, namely strong home times (to overcome the Section 214(b) ground of denial) and not satisfying any of the grounds <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility.</b>|$|R
5000|$|If the {{applicant}} is inadmissible {{because they have}} sought to procure an immigration benefit by fraud or misrepresenting a material factSection 212(a)(6)(C)(i), they may apply for a Waiver <b>of</b> Ground <b>of</b> <b>Inadmissibility</b> on Form I-601.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{applicant}} is inadmissible {{because they have}} been unlawfully present in the United States for more than 180 days (3-year bar) or one year (10-year bar), they may apply for a Waiver <b>of</b> Ground <b>of</b> <b>Inadmissibility</b> on Form I-601.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{important}} to note that an applicant MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE to apply for this waiver <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> if they were unlawfully present in the United States for more than one year, left the United States, then returned without being admitted or paroled (EWI).|$|R

This currently includes Class A Tuberculosis, Chancroid, Gonorrhea, Granuloma inguinale, Lymphogranuloma venereum, Syphilis, Leprosy or any other communicable disease {{as determined by the}} U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. [...] Individuals diagnosed with these illnesses may apply for a Waiver <b>of</b> Ground <b>of</b> <b>Inadmissibility</b> on Form I-601.|$|R
5000|$|Form I-94, {{endorsing}} both sections with [...] "WD - Application for Admission WIthdrawn. (Stamp Number), (Port), and (Date)." [...] In addition, Block 20 {{indicates the}} file number of the alien's case, Block 26 specifies the grounds <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility,</b> the withdrawal form served, and the flight or ship by which the alien is expected to depart.|$|R
50|$|An Application for Waiver <b>of</b> Grounds <b>of</b> <b>Inadmissibility</b> is an {{application}} for legal entry to the United States made by an individual who is otherwise inadmissible on one or more grounds. The application is submitted to the consular office, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office or immigration court considering the immigrant visa or adjustment of status application.|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Figueroa's {{case has}} set some {{important}} legal precedents {{that relates to}} the legal definition of different terms, such as: the legal definition of [...] "membership", [...] "organization", [...] "terrorism", and how those legal terms are used to advance on findings <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> under Section 34(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) against immigrants and refugees who {{at any point in}} life were part of or sympathizers of movements that fought in struggles for liberation. The finding <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> by the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board(IRB)against Mr. Figueroa on May 5, 2010, when compared with the fact that if the allegation had been brought against a prominent figure such a Nelson Mandela, highlights an evident paradox in the law. Mr. Mandela would have been found inadmissible into Canada due to his membership with the African National Congress (ANC), however, Nelson Mandela was an honorary citizen of Canada.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} {{hardship}} {{to the defendant}} is not relevant here, only the hardship caused to the qualifying family by removing the defendant or excluding him from admission. The waivers are governed by INA 212 and INA 237 (potentially some others: add?). The United States Waiver <b>of</b> <b>Inadmissibility</b> application is required for INA 212 waivers, while INA 237 waivers do not have such application.|$|R
50|$|Personal lack of blameworthiness was {{determined}} as {{not relevant to}} the matter <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> under paragraph 19(1)(l) of the former Canadian Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, which is now paragraph 35(1)(b) of the Act (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Adam, 2001 2 F.C. 337). Paragraph 35(1)(b) is not concerned with complicity in prohibited acts but with whether a position held is senior.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{applicant}} is inadmissible {{because they have}} engaged in alien smuggling, they may apply for a Waiver <b>of</b> Ground <b>of</b> <b>Inadmissibility</b> on Form I-601 ONLY IF they have encouraged,induced, assisted, abetted or aided an individual {{who at the time}} of the action was their spouse, parent, son or daughter (and no other individual) to enter the United States in violation of the law.|$|R
5000|$|Form I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility: If the {{applicant}} {{would otherwise be}} inadmissible to the United States (for instance due to unlawful entry or unauthorized stay) then Form I-601 must be included. The form is used to state one's existing grounds <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> and ask {{for them to be}} waived. There is a fee for this form. This form must be filed along with Form I-485.|$|R
50|$|At its 97th {{session on}} October 30, 2009 the United Nations Human Rights Committee {{presented}} a report {{about human rights}} in Russia based on the Russian LGBT Network report, emphasizing the violation of LGBT rights.In a December 24, press release, the network praised Patriarch Kirill’s declaration <b>of</b> the <b>inadmissibility</b> <b>of</b> discrimination based on sexual orientation.|$|R
2500|$|A 1999 policy {{letter from}} {{immigration}} officials defined [...] "public charge" [...] and identified which benefits are considered in public charge determinations, {{and the policy}} letter underlies current regulations and other guidance on the public charge grounds <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> and deportability. Collectively, the various sources addressing the meaning of public charge have historically suggested that an alien's receipt of public benefits, per se, is unlikely to result in the alien being deemed to be removable on public charge grounds.|$|R
40|$|Shrinkage {{estimation}} {{has become}} a basic tool {{in the analysis of}} high-dimensional data. Historically and conceptually a key development toward this was the discovery <b>of</b> the <b>inadmissibility</b> <b>of</b> the usual estimator of a multivariate normal mean. This article develops a geometrical explanation for this inadmissibility. By exploiting the spherical symmetry of the problem it is possible to effectively conceptualize the multidimensional setting in a two-dimensional framework that can be easily plotted and geometrically analyzed. We begin with the heuristic explanation for inadmissibility that was given by Stein [In Proceedings of the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability, 1954 – 1955, Vol. I (1956) 197 – 206, Univ. California Press]. Some geometric figures are included to make this reasoning more tangible. It is also explained why Stein’s argument falls short of yielding a proof <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility,</b> even when the dimension, p, is much larger than p = 3. We then extend the geometric idea to yield increasingly persuasive arguments for inadmissibility when p ≥ 3, albeit at the cost of increased geometric and computational detail...|$|R
50|$|In 2015 Mr Logvynskyi {{was elected}} as the Chairperson of the Inter-Fractional Association of Members of Parliament «Advocacy of Ukraine». On this {{position}} {{he managed to}} unite the Members of Parliament, advocates, human rights defenders and to set a platform for the dialogue regarding protection of advocate rights, assurance of the rule <b>of</b> law, <b>inadmissibility</b> <b>of</b> illegal interference into work of advocates.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation {{issued a}} formal {{warning to the}} party <b>of</b> the <b>inadmissibility</b> <b>of</b> the {{implementation}} of extremist activities. In May 2003 the NDPR was excluded from the unified state register of political parties as it {{failed to meet the}} legal requirement of fielding 45 registered regional offices (as the NDPR had only 40 at the time).|$|R
25|$|Both {{houses of}} Parliament finally {{approved}} the bill on June 30, {{the last day}} of the Parliamentary session. UMP voted in favour, the Communists and Socialists against, and UDF split over it between those voting against and those abstaining from voting. Socialist deputy Patrick Bloche defended a motion <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility,</b> claiming that the law was unconstitutional and thus that the Assembly had to refuse it; Communist deputies and president of the UDF François Bayrou announced that they supported the motion. The motion was voted down, predictably, because the UMP ruling party had an absolute majority in the Assembly.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{increased}} security {{concerns in the}} U.S. {{as a result of}} the September 11, 2001 attacks, many Canadian commercial drivers are required to obtain a FAST Pass by their employers. However, many of those drivers may not qualify through normal application because of a past criminal record. Moreover, some types of crimes, particularly those involving illegal drugs or moral turpitude, may make some Canadian applicants ineligible to enter the United States. Such applicants must first obtain a Canadian pardon (a Canadian Pardon is not recognized by the US) and/or a United States Waiver <b>of</b> <b>Inadmissibility</b> before a FAST Card will be issued.|$|R

50|$|A Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver is {{a waiver}} {{provided}} by the USCIS indicating that it waives unlawful presence in the United States as a ground <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> for a given applicant. It is obtained by applying with Form I-601A to the USCIS. It is used by people currently unlawfully present in the United States prior to departing the United States for a consular interview. USCIS notifies NVC once the Form I-601A is approved and the Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver is granted, so that NVC can process any visa application for the applicant based on a petition listing him or her as a beneficiary.|$|R
5000|$|Arriving Aliens: As {{a general}} rule, the Arriving Alien bears the legal {{burden of proof}} of clear {{admissibility}} to the United States. However, {{in the case of}} Arriving Aliens who have previously been granted Lawful Permanent Resident status, there is a presumpion in favor of granting them entry, with the exceptions being those aliens who satisfy {{one or more of the}} grounds <b>of</b> <b>inadmissibility</b> covered in INA Section 212. There is some legal ambiguity regarding who has the legal burden of proof here, but some legal scholars have held that the burden of proof falls on the prosecution in the case of LPRs.|$|R
