40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityThe internal fixation of fractures in bone {{with the aid of}} plates and screws is a common procedure in orthopaedic surgery. The prevention of <b>over-tightening</b> is entirely dependent upon the skill and judgement of the surgeon. The research reported here proposed two independent methods for the prevention of overtightening of orthopaedic screws. The first method developed by this research was a mathematical model for predicting the maximum torque that may be applied to a screw before <b>over-tightening</b> occurs. Use of the model would allow surgeons to set a torque-limiting device to prevent <b>over-tightening</b> during surgery. The model would also allow the surgeon to predict the maximum pullout force that screwlbone interface can withstand before failure occurs. The second method developed in this research to prevent <b>over-tightening</b> was the automated screwdriver. It was shown that the automated screwdriver could detect the onset of tightening thus preventing <b>over-tightening</b> without the aid of the mathematical model. The automated screwdriver was demonstrated to perform the following tasks:- (i) Pre-tapping (ii) Tightening of non-self-tapping and self-tapping screws. (iii) Insertion of self-drilling external screws. This research has conclusively demonstrated that both the proposed methods for the prevention of <b>over-tightening</b> orthopaedic screws are a contribution to orthopaedic surgery. The Author recommends that the mathematical model and the automated screwdriver are both further developed to prevent <b>over-tightening</b> and increase the speed and safety of screw insertion in surgery...|$|R

It is also {{available}} at: [URL] use of power screwdrivers and drills for tapping and screw insertion in surgery is becoming more common. It has been established from clinical observations {{that the use of}} a small air drill for inserting self-tapping screws provides improved coaxial alignment and precision, and that the drill should be stopped before the screw head is completely seated on the plate, presumably {{to reduce the risk of}} <b>over-tightening.</b> The risk of overrun and <b>over-tightening</b> during tapping and screw insertion is increased with the use of power tools. Prevention of <b>over-tightening</b> is dependent upon when the surgeon detects the onset of tightening, both visually and from the feel of the rapid increase in torque. If detection is too late, then <b>over-tightening</b> or stripping can occur. This study is concerned with using a mechatronic screwdriver to control the tapping depth and to prevent the <b>over-tightening</b> of screws. The effects of various parameters upon the torque profile during tapping and screw insertion have been investigated in synthetic bone and sheep tibia. An automated system is proposed for preventing <b>over-tightening</b> of pre-tapped and self-tapping screws when attaching a surgical plate to a sheep tibia in vitro.

This is less likely to occur when a wire is clamped between two plates by the action of a screw.

I congratulate the authors for the description; however, I {{would like to make}} the {{following}} points: 1. The authors had mentioned nonunion of distal femur for the case discussed in article after CT- scan (figure 2), which seems to be united in x ray- AP view (figure 1). But the lateral view was not provided for the same case. As the CT scan – sagittal section resembles a lateral view of the distal femur and there was no need of CT scan. Routine antero-posterior view and lateral view are enough to assess the union and if needed oblique views can be taken. This saves the patient from unnecessary radiation hazard of CT-scan. 2. With the use of ilizarov external fixator for femoral reconstruction, the tensioned wires do not cause <b>over-tightening</b> of skin. Quadricepsplasty is an elective procedure, purposefully giving the scar of skin grafting is not a profitable decision as after skin grafting, active quadriceps exercises would be delayed leading to failure of surgery and shows lack of preoperative planning.

40|$|Investigation on the {{stability}} and bifurcation of a rod-fastening rotor bearing system Yi Liu, Heng Liu, Jun Yi and Minqing Jing The stability and bifurcation of a flexible rod-fastening rotor bearing system (RBS) is investigated in this paper. The rod-fastening rotor has two kinds of special structural features – rods and interfaces. The circumferentially distributed rods are modeled as a constant stiffness matrix and an add-on moment vector, which {{is caused by the}} unbalanced pre-tightening forces. The stiffness matrix of interface is composed of normal and tangential contact stiffness, which are determined by the pre-tightening forces. After the shaft is discretized by Timoshenko elements, the system is reduced by a component mode synthesis. Periodic motions and stability margins are obtained by using the shooting method and path-following technique, and the local stability of system is obtained by using the Floquet theory. Comparisons indicate that the rod-fastening and complete RBS have a general resemblance in the bifurcation characteristics when mass eccentricity and rotating speed are changed. The unbalanced <b>over-tightening</b> of rods brings initial bending to the rotor, which leads to obvious influence on the nonlinear responses of the system. Moreover, the pre-tightening forces should be sufficiently applied because the small pre-tightening forces make the system more flexible and unstable through the effect of contact interfaces. Generally, this paper presents a method for analyzing {{the stability}} and bifurcation of the rod-fastening RBS...|$|R

30|$|An {{approximately}} 7  cm incision from slightly lateral to the {{coracoid process}} was made {{running along the}} deltopectoral groove. The posterolateral surface of the humeral head was carefully inspected by palpation {{for the presence of}} an impression fracture (Hill-Sachs lesion). After exposing the tendon of the subscapularis muscle, it was vertically transected, 1 – 2  cm proximal from its insertion on the minor tubercle. After incising the capsule, a Fukuda retractor was used facilitating inspection of the glenoid surface. When a labral detachment (i.e., Bankart lesion) was identified, it was repaired in the following way. The labrum was reattached to the anterior glenoidal rim together with the capsule using suture anchors. In case of a capsular tear, a capsular repair was performed. Subsequently, the subscapularis muscle was shortened by transferring the medial part under the lateral part; consequently, imbrication of the capsule was achieved in all patients. <b>Over-tightening</b> of the subscapularis muscle may lead to an undue post-operative restriction in range of motion. In order to asses whether the subscapularis muscle and capsule were not too tight or too loose, the arm was placed alongside the body with the elbow in 90 ° flexion with the thumb pointing up during subscapularis reefing. In this position, the shoulder was required to reach neutral position (0 ° of external rotation). However, when unsupported, gravity was not expected to externally rotate the arm any further.

Intracranial abscess and seizure {{associated with the use of}} the halo device is an unusual complication, and only a few cases have been reported in the literature. A 21 -year-old male had a halo vest placed for the management of an odontoid type II fracture, which he sustained from a motor vehicle accident. Ten weeks after halo ring placement he complained of headaches which relieved by analgesics. After 2  weeks he was admitted at the emergency unit in an unconscious condition after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The halo pins were displaced during the seizure and were removed at his admission. No drainage was noted from the pin sites, and a Philadelphia cervical collar was applied. A brain CT and MRI revealed intracranial penetration of both posterior pins and a brain abscess in the right parietal lobe. Computed tomography of the cervical spine revealed stable fusion of the odontoid fracture. Cultures from the pin sites were negative; however, intravenous wide spectrum antibiotic treatment was administered to the patient immediately for 4  weeks followed by oral antibiotics for additional 2  weeks. Anti-epileptic medication was also started at his admission. The patient was discharged from the hospital in 6  weeks without symptoms, continuing anti-epileptic medication.

30|$|Lag screws {{which have}} {{benefits}} of minimal loosening and slippage {{during the initial}} application of loads are increasingly used to join timber members [1]. Construction management {{is an important component}} of ensuring lag screw joints are sufficiently strong, which require managers to exercise more caution than with bolt joints. For example, lag screws often cause wood cracking if screwed in without drilling a pilot hole, or driven in using a hammer [1]. These concerns are not limited to wood cracking: <b>over-tightening</b> lag screws may cause such joints to no longer perform at their true strength. Take for example the case of using a wrench to join a steel plate (or washer) to a timber member with a lag screw. Some of the force generated acts as a compressive force on the timber member, which generates an equivalent pull-out force on the lag screw. Tightening the lag screw until the pull-out force exceeds the wood’s pull-out strength causes the axial force on the joint (“clamp force” below) to weaken, leading to poor adhesion between the two members. Among other construction management-related considerations, builders should ensure that lag screw joints are fastened with the proper amount of torque to prevent this from happening. To determine what constitutes “proper” torque, it is imperative to determine first the degree of clamp force caused by tightening a lag screw, and second how that clamp force relates to the pull-out strength of that screw. While many studies have been conducted on screw joints’ pull-out strength, shear strength, and other mechanical properties [2 – 9], we can find none that regard the relationship between clamp force and pull-out force for lag screws. We are currently developing a high damping shear wall, in which the clamp force of lag screws in wood acts as a frictional resistance force between two timber members or between a timber member and a steel plate [10]. Controlling the clamp force {{is an important part of}} generating the frictional resistance in this project. We thus became interested in clarifying the relationship between clamp force and pull-out strength in lag screws, to investigate techniques for controlling the clamp force of lag screws.|$|R

This survey was generated from over 15 nations with the vast majority of boarders on the snow for five to fifty days a year. Significant emphasis was placed on the relationship between boarder binding set-up and occurrence of pain and/or injury. From the detailed survey it was found that boarder's experienced pain in the front foot/toe area as a result from the toe strap being too tight. However boarders wanted tighter bindings to increase responsiveness. Survey data was compared to ankle and foot biomechanics to build a relationship to assess the problem of pain versus responsiveness.

The new design developed using additive manufacturing techniques was tested via qualitative and quantitative measures in the snow and in the lab.

40|$|Double-nut {{anchor bolt}} systems {{are used in}} the {{erection}} of traffic signal poles, high-mast luminaries, and other highway appurtenances. An absence of a tightening standard for such systems decreases the confidence in their performance under fatigue loading. Past research has shown that a tightening standard should include the development of preload in the anchor bolt sufficient to provide adequate resistance to fatigue failure. Preload should be measured by a turn-of-the-nut method. Laboratory progressive tightening tests were performed in order to monitor the stress ranges occurring in the bolt at various locations of interest at various degrees of turn-of-the-nut tightness. Tests were performed on six diameters of anchor bolt ranging from 1 to 2 - 1 / 4 inches in diameter and two different categories of thread pitch: UNC and 8 UN. Plots of stress range versus degree of tightness were developed for each test and evaluated to find the minimum degree of turn-of-the-nut at which stress range inside the nuts dropped below that outside the nuts. This shift was considered to be the principle theoretical indication of adequate performance. A fatigue test which saw failure outside the double-nut connection was set down as the practical indicator of adequate fatigue performance. The 2 inch 8 UN bolt was chosen as the critical specimen due to its overall low generation of preload during tightening tests. Theoretical testing showed that 1 / 24 turn-of-the-nut would guarantee sufficient fatigue performance. Two practical fatigue tests of the bolt at that tightness saw one positive and one negative failure. After actual lab tests, finite element modeling was used to investigate the behavior of the bolt. It was found that performance did not see improvement until 1 / 12 turn-of-the-nut. After all results were considered, a standard of 1 / 6 turn-of-the-nut or refusal of tightening by specified methods was recommended, provided a minimum of 1 / 12 turn-of-the-nut was achieved. This value allows for ease of measurement, sufficient tightness, degree of safety, and has been shown in past testing not to cause failure through <b>over-tightening.</b> However, tightening to only 1 / 12 turn-of-the-nut still provided adequate performance...|$|R

Significant emphasis was placed on the relationship between boarder binding set-up and occurrence of pain and/or injury. From the detailed survey it was found that boarder 2 ̆ 7 s experienced pain in the front foot/toe area as a result from the toe strap being too tight. However boarders wanted tighter bindings to increase responsiveness. Survey data was compared to ankle and foot biomechanics to build a relationship to assess the problem of pain versus responsiveness. The design stage {{of the study was to}} develop a binding that overcame the <b>over-tightening</b> of the binding but still maintain equivalent or better responsiveness compared to traditional bindings. The resulting design integrated the snowboard boot much more into the design, by using the sole as a "semi-rigid" platform and locking it in laterally between the heel cup and the new toe strap arrangement. The new design developed using additive manufacturing techniques was tested via qualitative and quantitative measures in the snow and in the lab. It was found that using the new arrangement in a system resulted in no loss of performance or responsiveness to the user. Due to the design and manufacturing approach users have the ability to customise the design to their specific needs...|$|R
