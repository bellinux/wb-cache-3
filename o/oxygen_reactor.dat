40|$|The {{objective}} of {{the study reported here}} was {{to determine the effects of}} consistency, temperature, caustic addition rate and reaction time on the level of delignification for softwood brownstock pulp produced at Jay. Performance of Current System Analysis of mill process data suggests that the current oxygen delignification system at Jay achieves approximately a 25 to 27 % reduction in kappa number. The pulp leaving the oxygen system typically has an intrinsic viscosity of about 1100 cc/gram and corresponds to a TAPPI viscosity of about 39 centipoises, which is quite high. Samples taken of the pulp going to the <b>oxygen</b> <b>reactor</b> indicate that the alkali concentration going to the reactor is about 3 grams per liter and approximately 100 Kg per metric ton of COD and 200 Kg per metric ton of Color are carried over from the brown stock washers. Based upon the experimental results it was concluded that approximately half of the alkali in the pulp going to the pressurized <b>oxygen</b> <b>reactor</b> currently comes from the alkali in the carryover from the brownstock washers. The laboratory results further suggest that approximately 65 % of the delignification that is taking place in the oxygen delignification process in the mill takes place in the 15 minute pressurized reactor and the piping prior to the reactor; while about 35 % of the drop in kappa number takes place in the atmospheric tower. Important Process Variables Controlling Delignification Important process variables controlling the level of oxygen delignification, in their order of importance, are the reaction temperature, alkali concentration and oxygen pressure. Of the variables investigated experimentally, raising the temperature in the reactor is the most important variable driving the reaction. High pressure is desirable because it reduces the volume of gas that must be mixed into the pulp by the high shear mixer. The alkali concentration going to the reactor is determined by the carry over of alkali, the pulp consistency and the alkali being added to the reactor...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{research}} on aerobic granulation has been intensive. So far, almost all aerobic granules can form only in sequencing batch reactors (SBR), while the reason is not yet understood. This paper attempts to review the factors involved in aerobic granulation in SBR, including substrate composition, organic loading rate, hydrodynamic shear force, feast-famine regime, feeding strategy, dissolved <b>oxygen,</b> <b>reactor</b> configuration, solids retention time, cycle time, settling time and exchange ratio. The major selection pressures responsible for aerobic granulation are identified as the settling time and exchange ratio. A concept of the minimal settling velocity of bioparticles is proposed; and it is quantitatively demonstrated {{that the effects of}} settling time and exchange ratio on aerobic granulation in SBR can be interpreted and unified {{on the basis of this}} concept very well. It appears that the formation and characteristics of aerobic granules can be manipulated through properly adjusting either the settling time or the exchange ratio in SBR.

40|$|Requirements on {{the quality}} of the {{effluents}} discharged by Messrs. Julius Glatz GmbH Papermills in Neidenfels/Germany with their plants Neidenfels and Frankeneck exceeded by far the generally acknowledged technical norms. Messrs. Glatz GmbH has chosen a purifying method which clearly improved the quality of the effluent beyond the demanded values, a system known as a BIOlogical Fixed-film <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Reactor</b> (BIOFOR). The biological reactor shows an extremely high operational reliability. Even though the contamination of the waste water differs, the installed capacity is sufficient enough to meet the demanded water quality. After the semi-technical trials, the purifying efficiency is much better than expected. Halogen-organic compounds - AOX - are eliminated up to 50 %, thus a stable AOX-concentration of below 0. 1 mg/l in the effluent is obtained. The mechanism to eliminate AOX converts more than 90 % of the eliminated AOX into inorganic chloride and is equivalent to a biological decomposition. The high total elimination capacity of the plant is obviously, apart of the biological decomposition and the mechanical filtration effect, also a matter of an adsorption of smallest particles, colloids and molecular dissolved organic compounds on the biological fixed film of the reactor. The stability of the purifying capacity, the low maintenance expanditure and the relative low specific operating costs of the plant makes especially this process very suitable for this application.

40|$|Dual Digestion is a {{two-stage}} {{system that}} combines autothermal thermophilic aerobic pre-treatment with conventional anaerobic digestion. The practicability {{of the system}} using pure oxygen is well proven. Disadvantages are {{the high cost of}} the pure oxygen and the absence of a detailed evaluation of anaerobic digester performance. This report discusses the results of a full-scale investigation into the dual digestion system (184 m³ aerobic reactor and 1800 m³ anaerobic digester), carried out in two phases: In the first using air alone for oxygenating the aerobic reactor and in the second using a combination of air and pure oxygen. During both phases the performance of the anaerobic digester was also monitored, but in greater detail in the second phase as far as the final sludge product is concerned. In phase I, with air, it was possible to maintain thermophilic temperatures in the aerobic reactor throughout the year. However, the required retention times were relatively long (3 - 6 days) in comparison with the pure <b>oxygen</b> <b>reactor</b> (~ 1 day) due to the high vapour heat losses. At long retention times, the volatile solids (VS) destruction was appreciable (~ 25 %) and the reactor tended towards an autothermal thermophilic digester. Foaming, although unpredictable in its occurrence, significantly improved aerobic reactor performance by doubling the oxygen transfer efficiency. From liquid and gas mass and heat balances {{it was found that the}} specific biological heat yield and respiration quotient were approximately constant at 12. 8 MJ/kg(O₂) and 0. 70 mol(CO₂) /mol(O₂) respectively over a wide range of operating conditions and consistent relationships between VS removal, heat generation, and oxygen utilisation could be established. Based on information collected, it was concluded that increased treatment capacity and greater temperature control of the aerobic reactor could be provided by supplementing air oxygenation with pure oxygen. In phase II, using a combination of air and pure oxygen, much higher loading rates on the aerobic reactor were possible. Thermophilic temperatures could be maintained at short retention times (1 - 2 days). Unfortunately, no foaming occurred during this period. Consequently, the benefit of improved oxygen transfer efficiency of the air oxygenation system, produced by the foam, could not be exploited. Liquid and gas mass and heat balances confirmed the specific heat yield and respiration quotient values and the relationship between oxygen utilisation, VS destruction and biological heating. During phase II, the anaerobic digester operated at a retention time of ~ 10 days. The sensible heat content of the hot sludge from the aerobic reactor was sufficient to force the digester into the thermophilic temperature range. The stability of the anaerobic process and final sludge product at this short retention time was monitored with % VS removal and residual specific oxygen utilisation rate tests and found to be similar to that of conventional mesophilic anaerobic digestion at 20 days retention time. Dewaterability as reflected by the specific resistance to filtration (SRF) was found to be poor, but 11 ot much worse than for conventional mesophilic digestion. Sufficient information was obtained during phases I and II to allow a mathematical model to be compiled, which could reasonably reliably simulate all the main operating parameters of the dual digestion system. The model provided a means for assessing different system configurations with mesophilic or thermophilic digestion, with and without heat exchange or gas engine external heat sources, allowing technical and economical (capital and operating) feasibility to be evaluated and compared with that for conventional digestion. From both the experimental and modelled results, all the claimed benefits of the dual digestion system were verified with the exception of the claim that aerobic reactor heat pre-treatment of the sludge allows the anaerobic digester to operate at short retention times (~ 10 days). However, the digester can be operated at 10 days retention provided its temperature is in the thermophilic range, in which case a sufficiently stable sludge is produced; at mesophilic temperatures, a retention time of 15 days or longer is required to produce a sludge of equivalent stability to that from conventional mesophilic digestion. Consequently, it is not the stability of the anaerobic process per se that governs the minimum retention time but the quality required for the final sludge product. The aerobic reactor is an appropriate pre-treatment stage for the thermophilic digester because it provides the necessary temperature and pH buffering to allow stable operation in the thermophilic range. It is concluded that where application of conventional anaerobic digestion is contemplated, whether for new installations or for upgrading existing plants, the dual digestion system should be seriously considered as a possible option. It competes favourably both technically and economically with conventional mesophilic digestion and produces a superior sludge product which can be beneficially utilised in agriculture...|$|E

In this project a unique monolith heat and mass exchanger <b>reactor</b> with an <b>oxygen</b> permeable membrane was proposed by the Norsk Hydro Oil and Energy Research Center in Norway. The aim of this thesis is to describe a complete design of a monolithic reactor where both heat and oxygen transport takes place.

Further, an investigation of the total pressure drop and pressure distribution of the manifolding system using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool FLUENT was carried out. A further goal was also to perform dynamic analysis of the AZEP reactor. In order to perform such analysis, calculation tools were needed to describe the performance of CO 2 capture. The object-oriented programming languages Modelica and Dymola were used to describe dynamic behavior of the <b>oxygen</b> transfer <b>reactor.</b> Sensitivity studies performed with the membrane model showed that a high inlet sweep temperature would raise the magnitude of the oxygen permeation flux through the MCMmembrane. At the same time high inlet air temperatures would be necessary to keep the driving potential through the length of the membrane at a higher level which would be important for achieving the targeted industrial values of oxygen fluxes. The dynamic simulations showed that disturbances on sweep flow had larger impact on the membranes performance than disturbances introduced on the air side of the reactor. By introduction of a new solution of flow manifolds (linear channel arrangement) a less complex header system than the one in the AZEP solution was achieved. Since the implementation of detailed membrane model in heat and mass balance calculations for system studies would result in excessive calculation time, results from this study were utilized for the generation of correlations describing the oxygen transfer as a function of operating parameters such as temperature and partial pressure. This modeling approach was expected to improve the accuracy of the system studies...|$|R

The reactor was also shown to operate isothermally despite high reaction rate, an appreciable heat effect and high reactant concentration (TOF = 300 h- 1, ?H°r = - 183. 7 kJ mol- 1). Staged injection of oxygen {{along the length of the}} reactor was investigated as a method of increasing the selectivity of oxidation reactions. Staged injection was shown to be beneficial; however, this was likely to be due to the development of a more uniform hydrodynamic regime of two-phase flow along the packed reaction channel. Experiments were performed with the ruthenium(III) hydrated oxide catalyst supported on alumina (0. 9 wt% Ru/Al 2 O 3). High activity and selectivity were observed even when working with reactant concentrations approaching industrial conditions (1 mol L- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Microwave heating {{has many}} {{potential}} lunar applications including sintering regolith for lunar surface stabilization and heating regolith for various <b>oxygen</b> production <b>reactors.</b> The microwave properties of lunar simulants {{must be understood}} so this technology {{can be applied to}} lunar operations. Dielectric properties at microwave frequencies for a common lunar simulant, JSC- 1 AC, were measured up to 1100 C, which is approximately the melting point. The experimentally determined dielectric properties included real and imaginary permittivity (epsilon', epsilon"), loss tangent (tan delta), and half-power depth, the di stance at which a material absorbs 50 % of incident microwave energy. Measurements at 2. 45 GHz revealed tan delta of JSC- 1 A increases from 0. 02 at 25 C to 0. 31 at 110 C. The corresponding half-power depth decreases from a peak of 286 mm at 110 C, to 13 mm at 1100 C. These data indicate that JSC- 1 AC becomes more absorbing, and thus a better microwave heater as temperature increases. A half-power depth maximum at 100 - 200 C presents a barrier to direct microwave heating at low temperatures. Microwave heating experiments confirm the sluggish heating effect of weak absorption below 200 C, and increasingly strong absorption above 200 C, leading to rapid heating and melting of JSC- 1 AC...|$|R
40|$|A microstructured falling film reactor {{was applied}} to the dye-sensitized {{photochemical}} conversion of 1, 5 -dihydroxynaphthalene to juglone. This continuous-flow microreactor enables the efficient contacting of a gas and a liquid phase in combination with external irradiation by high-power LED arrays offering various wavelengths. Two sensitizers were used for the photochemical in situ generation of singlet oxygen as key step in the synthesis of the natural product juglone. The photochemical process was investigated according LED wavelength, LED power, <b>oxygen</b> partial pressure, <b>reactor</b> architecture, substrate concentration and flow rate, and optimized to a conversion of X = 97 % with 99 % selectivity. Based on the experimental results process parameters like quantum efficiency, productivity and space time yield were calculated and used for the evaluation of the photochemically catalyzed synthesis of juglone in continuous-flow mode...|$|R
