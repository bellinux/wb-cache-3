Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince Michael said in a conversation with the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: …they did not proceed as stated in their instructions but as their <b>own</b> <b>good</b> required and obtained privileges for themselves. He would try to avoid the obligations imposed on him {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E
5|$|At a diner called Winkie's, a man {{tells his}} {{companion}} about a nightmare {{in which he}} dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing {{the man with the}} nightmare to collapse in fright. Elsewhere, director Adam Kesher has his film commandeered by mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes as the lead in his film. Adam resists, but after being thrown out of his house when he finds his wife cheating on him, he learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his <b>own</b> <b>good.</b> Later, a bungling hit man attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead.|$|E
5|$|At the Magic Box, Giles {{recognizes that}} he must stand aside if Buffy is to face her {{responsibilities}} in caring for Dawn instead of relying on him ("Standing") and Tara finds {{a picture of the}} forget-me-not flower Willow used to cast a spell on her in a book of magic. Giles and Tara separately resolve to leave the people they love, respectively Buffy and Willow — Giles wants to leave Buffy for her <b>own</b> <b>good,</b> while Tara wants to leave Willow because she has become horrified by Willow’s magical manipulation of their relationship ("Under Your Spell / Standing—Reprise"). Captured by Spike outside the store, one of Sweet’s minions conveys a challenge from Sweet for Buffy to rescue Dawn from The Bronze. Giles forbids the gang to assist Buffy, so she goes alone, despite having no will to do so; eventually Giles and the Scoobies change their minds and leave to catch up. Although Spike initially thinks that things would be better for him if Buffy was dead, he also changes his mind and decides to help Buffy; Sweet opines that Buffy is drawn to danger ("Walk Through the Fire").|$|E

5|$|Following the {{departure}} of defender Sol Campbell and retirement of striker Dennis Bergkamp {{in the summer of}} 2006, Gilberto was announced as Arsenal's vice-captain for the 2006–07 season. He began the season well, as he scored the first ever goal at the Dutch DSB Stadion in a pre-season friendly match. He then scored Arsenal's first ever goal in a competitive match at the Emirates Stadium in a 1–1 draw with Aston Villa. His good form continued for Arsenal as he scored several league goals, garnering praise for his performances as stand-in captain while Thierry Henry was injured. Gilberto and his agent (Paulo Villana) also reiterated the player's desire to honour his contract with the Gunners. Meanwhile, Gilberto's good form carried through to {{the second half of the}} season. Even though Arsenal only managed to finish fourth in the league, he ended the season as Arsenal's second highest scorer with 10 Premier League goals. The explanation for his unusually high tally is the fact that Henry suffered two lengthy injury spells, in which Gilberto stepped up as captain to take penalties. Gilberto's goal scoring record combined with his <b>own</b> <b>good</b> form in midfield and his leadership of Wenger's youthful squad led some Arsenal fans and football pundits to label Gilberto as Arsenal's best player of the season, and one of the best in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|The family's {{fame and}} notoriety {{were to be}} short-lived. Subsequent generations settled down in Somerset to live the lives of county gentry, {{representing}} Somerset in Parliament and when necessary following occupations {{in the army and}} the church. This peaceful existence was jolted when the estate was inherited by William Phelips (1823–89), who in his early days made many improvements and renovations to Montacute. He was responsible for the Base Court, a low service range adjoining {{the south side of the}} mansion. and the restoration of the Great Chamber, which he transformed into a library. Later, he was to become insane; an addicted gambler, he was eventually incarcerated for his <b>own</b> <b>good.</b> Sadly for his family, this was after he had gambled away the family fortune and vast tracts of the Montacute Estate. In 1875, when his son William Phelips (1846–1919) took control of the estate, agricultural rents from what remained of the mortgaged estate were low, and the house was a drain on limited resources. Selling the family silver and art works delayed the inevitable by a few years, but in 1911 the family were forced to let the house, for an annual sum of £650, and move out. The Phelipses never returned.|$|E

25|$|A notable {{aspect of}} the karma theory in Buddhism is merit transfer. A person accumulates merit not only through {{intentions}} and ethical living, but also is able to gain merit from others by exchanging goods and services, such as through dāna (charity to monks or nuns). Further, a person can transfer one's <b>own</b> <b>good</b> karma to living family members and ancestors.|$|E

25|$|Many biblical authors draw {{a strong}} {{connection}} between love {{of others and}} love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman {{is the same as}} hatred of God. Thomas Jay Oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's <b>own</b> <b>good</b> when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, the {{expansion}} of private production erodes the quality of commonly <b>owned</b> <b>goods,</b> thereby forcing individuals to rely increasingly on private goods to satisfy their needs. In {{the face of this}} deterioration, households keep their labor supplies and saving rates relatively high in spite of their increasing private wealth. By so doing, each household contributes to an increase in production and thus has a detrimental [...] though negligible [...] impact on commonly <b>owned</b> <b>goods.</b> Perpetual growth is the outcome of this self-fuelling process. Since long-run growth results from a coordination failure, it may be higher than socially desirable...|$|R
25|$|While {{some of his}} men thought Oates to be too {{aggressive}} for his <b>own</b> <b>good</b> and theirs, most admired his courage and affirmed that he was always to {{be found at the}} front of his men, in the thick of combat, and that he never asked them to go anywhere that he was not willing to go himself. A political rival, Alexander Lowther, would replace Oates as regimental commander in July 1864 after allegedly engineering Oates' removal from command. It was Oates, however, who led the 15th Alabama into its most noted engagement of the war, at Little Round Top on July 2, 1863, during {{the second day of the}} Battle of Gettysburg.|$|E

Päts, Westel and other big businessmen, mostly members of Päts's Farmers' Unions party, have thus been accused to use this {{transaction}} money for their <b>own</b> <b>good.</b> It has also been claimed that the Bank of Estonia gave out several loans to enterprises that were related to Päts's activities and almost all other loans were given to enterprises related {{to the members of}} the bank's own council and other top-level politicians. Having big loans was also the reason why Päts, Westel and other top-level politicians did not fight with the hyperinflation at the time.|$|E

50|$|It is {{typically}} demonstrated in a paradigm {{in which some}} participants in an experiment are randomly assigned to <b>own</b> a <b>good</b> ("owners") by receiving it for free. Other participants are randomly assigned to simply evaluate the same good without receiving it. Participants who <b>own</b> the <b>good</b> typically rate it as more attractive or as liking it more than do participants who do not own it. It {{is not necessary to}} actually <b>own</b> a <b>good</b> to exhibit the mere ownership effect. Simply touching or imagining that one <b>owns</b> a <b>good</b> is enough to instantiate the mere ownership effect.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of its founding, grocery stores did not allow their {{customers}} to gather their <b>own</b> <b>goods.</b> Instead, a customer would give a list of items to a clerk, who would then go through the store himself, gathering them. This created a greater cost, therefore higher prices. Piggly Wiggly introduced the innovation of allowing customers to go through the store, gathering their <b>own</b> <b>goods.</b> This cut costs, allowing for lower prices. Others were initially experimenting with this format as well, which initially {{came to be known as}} a [...] "grocerteria", reminding people of cafeterias, another relatively new, self-service idea.|$|R

25|$|Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (the RaMCHaL) {{posited that}} God's purpose in {{creation}} {{was to give}} a gift from God's good to another being. Since God is perfect, {{it would have been}} insufficient for God to give merely a partial good. Rather, God would have to give the ultimate good that God's creation – humankind – could receive. As God is the true good, that ultimate good is found in God. Allowing God's creatures to become more attached to God would thus allow them to experience this ultimate receivable good. Thus, the purpose of creation was to bring into existence a creature who could derive pleasure from God's <b>own</b> <b>good.</b> God further recognized that for humanity to most enjoy this good, humanity would have to feel that humanity had earned it. God therefore arranged that humanity be able to perceive right and wrong, and have access to both. God thus gave humanity the means to earn the attachment to God that God sought to give.|$|E
25|$|Cleckley {{writes in}} the fifth edition that he remains, since before the first edition, profoundly struck both {{by the lack of}} {{response}} to treatment of those he classes as psychopathic, and by the legal difficulty of trying to detain them in hospital. While noting the issue of the protection of liberty, he argues that better ways must be found to do the latter for their <b>own</b> <b>good</b> and that of society, on the primary basis of demonstrated disability and need, perhaps within psychiatric units but segregated from other patients. He notes that neither psychological therapy or physical methods such as shock therapy or lobotomy appear to be a real solution to the problem, but suggests that more opportunity to control and direct the person may help psychiatrists treat them in the long-run. He also considers the issue of competency hearings and the insanity defense when crimes are committed. He expresses concern that his prior equating of psychopathy with psychosis was not intended to imply that psychopaths should be automatically found not guilty. However he also expresses dissatisfaction with sending psychopaths to prison which he believes will inevitably fail to correct the behaviour due to the underlying abnormality or masked 'insanity'.|$|E
25|$|Codreanu {{had to go}} into hiding, {{waiting for}} things to calm down and delegating {{leadership}} to General Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul, who later assumed partial guilt for Duca's killing; Stelescu, who soon became Codreanu's adversary as head of the Crusade of Romanianism, later alleged that he had been given refuge by a cousin of Magda Lupescu, Carol's mistress, implying that the Guard was becoming corrupt ("She was a person adverse to your action. How did you get along so well?"). Codreanu's resurgence brought arrest and prosecution under the martial law imposed in the country; he was acquitted yet again. Despite Codreanu's attacks on the elite as hopelessly corrupt and self-serving, at his trial in 1934 a number of respected politicians like Gheorghe I. Brătianu, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu testified for Codreanu as character witnesses. The Iron Guard did have some links to the Nazi Party's foreign office under Alfred Rosenberg, but in 1933–34 the Romanian fascist that was the main beneficiary of financial support from Rosenberg was Codreanu's rival Octavian Goga who lacked Codreanu's mass following and thus was more biddable. A further issue for the Nazis was concern over Codreanu's statements that Romania had too many minorities for its <b>own</b> <b>good,</b> which led to fears that Codreanu might persecute the volksdeutsch minority if he came to power. But the connections between the NSDAP and the Iron Guard, as limited as they were, did add to the Legion's appeal as the Iron Guard was associated in the public mind with the apparently dynamic and successful society of Nazi Germany.|$|E
