40|$|In recent years, {{integrated}} {{process planning}} and scheduling {{models have been}} proposed as solutions that can {{bridge the gap between}} practical process planning and production scheduling. However, most structures of these models have been algorithm-based and hence may not be very useful when a problem contains process and operational aspects that are difficult to capture in an algorithm template. In dynamic manufacturing environments, examples of such aspects include process and <b>operational</b> <b>flexibilities</b> that enable manufacturers to cope with unexpected variations in production and product mix. Appropriate process planning models that take cognizance of such aspects can be proven more useful to human process planners. In this paper, an innovative multiple parts process planning (MPPP) model for solving process planning problems with process and <b>operational</b> <b>flexibilities</b> is introduced. This model strikes a balance between process- and operations-related meta-data in a bid to capture process and <b>operational</b> <b>flexibilities</b> in the search for an optimal process planning solution. Merits of this model are discussed with reference to the operations of a typical serial-parallel flexible flow line. An illustrative example of the modeling framework is outlined. In seeking a feasible solution, a relative comparative analysis is carried out between; (a) a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm and (b) a simulated annealing algorithm that implements a mutation operator. Results show that the SA algorithm with a mutation operator outperforms the SA algorithm without a mutation operator...|$|R

40|$|IT {{flexibility}} is {{an increasingly important}} factor in today's dynamic business environment. However, earlier research lacks 1) an integrated framework that corresponds to diverse processes for supply chain management and 2) an explanation of how IT flexibility affects firms’ performance in the supply chain context. To fill these gaps, our study theorised a research model by integrating disparate streams of IT flexibility research with three types of IT <b>flexibility,</b> namely, <b>operational,</b> transactional, and strategic, and tested both the direct and indirect effects of the three IT flexibility types on firm performance. Our theoretical model uses an extended resource-based view to highlight the role of IT flexibility in managing interdependent firm relationships in supply chains. Using a partial least squares approach to structured equation modelling analysis on 162 questionnaires from supply chain practitioners, we found two significant relationships: (1) transactional IT <b>flexibility</b> affects <b>operational</b> IT <b>flexibility,</b> and (2) <b>operational</b> IT <b>flexibility</b> affects strategic IT flexibility. Transactional IT flexibility also affects strategic IT flexibility, thus playing {{a pivotal role in}} the effectiveness of the other two flexibility types. In addition, it was identified that transactional and <b>operational</b> <b>flexibilities</b> affect firm performance indirectly, via process integration capability, while strategic flexibility directly affects firm performance. By classifying diverse IT flexibility attributes into three types, a comprehensive and explicit concept of IT flexibility in inter-organisational relationships is attained, which allows practitioners to target key resource investments to realise the full potential of IT in the supply chain...|$|R

In this market, customized services related to research, development and manufacturing of chemicals, intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients are offered to {{a small number of}} customers. Traditionally, customers are granted a large degree of freedom with respect to demand quantity and time exposing the manufacturer to high uncertainty and financial risk. Using a model-based approach we quantify the effect of this contractual flexibility and relate it to the manufacturing flexibility concerning capacity allocation. Through the valuation of these flexibilities we provide first insights for the manufacturer on which customer requests to accept, how to set up the associated contracts with the customers and how to allocate capacity for a given portfolio of products.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} use of <b>operational</b> <b>flexibilities</b> in production planning in order to mitigate {{the negative effects of}} supply and quality uncertainty. Uncertainties in supply and quality are commonly experienced among agro-businesses, and in particular, in the wine industry. The goal of the dissertation is to provide prescriptive solutions in mitigating such risks from the lives of agricultural businesses. The first essay of the dissertation examines the impact of supply and quality uncertainty on the investment decisions made by winemakers who lease vineyard space to grow their own fruit. At the end of the growing season, the winemaker receives an uncertain amount of high- and low-quality grapes, due to varying growing conditions such as adverse weather conditions, diseases and natural disasters. High-quality grapes are used in the making of a high-end (reserve) wine, and low-quality grapes are used for the production of a low-end wine. In this study, we investigate the benefits of the downward substitution flexibility, where the winemaker uses its excess high-quality grapes for the production of its low-end wine. In addition, we examine the influence of...|$|R

25|$|Early in 2013, SEPTA {{began to}} {{undertake}} major operational improvements and physical rehabilitation on the Manayunk/Norristown Line. Central to {{this project is}} {{the replacement of the}} 80-year-old wayside automatic block signal system with one that displays only in the operating cab, and operates in both directions on both tracks, thereby allowing greater <b>operational</b> <b>flexibility.</b> Two new remotely controlled interlockings are being constructed to facilitate bidirectional operation, one at Miquon, the other in Norristown between the main station and the Ford Street crossing. An electrified storage track is also being constructed at Miquon to allow for temporary turnback of trains at that station, as the line is periodically subjected to flooding from the Schuylkill River around Spring Mill and Conshohocken. Ongoing replacement of the line's overhead catenary, most of which is 80 years old, will continue along with the signal replacement. Also occurring in conjunction with these projects are the replacement of crossties, renewal of grade crossing surfaces, and trimming of brush and trees alongside the right-of-way.

30|$|A {{sustainable}} business model depends on well-designed revenue and cost structures [17]. Thanks to the asset-light infrastructure and <b>operational</b> <b>flexibilities</b> of CL, many authors presume a minimisation of costs [14, 21, 41]. This implies that, {{as opposed to}} traditional LSPs, no warehouses, vehicle fleet or employed drivers are required [14]. Nevertheless, an appropriate revenue model needs {{to take account of}} the additional costs, such as insurance, software development, training, routing instructions, GPS devices and packets for shipments [2]. Designing an effective cost model is a major challenge. It is determined based on crowd characteristics, such as the transport flows, motivation and modal choice [11]. Existing CL platforms employ different strategies to incentivise the crowd. The interviewed practitioners also raised a number of possible applications. Individuals that move dedicatedly or make large detours can be compensated more and monetary, rewarding their flexibility. Vice versa, persuading the crowd to bring along parcels on existing trips could require less earnings or incentives of non-monetary nature. Essentially, addressing the crowd’s motivation is paramount. Similar considerations can be made regarding their modal choice. A platform can choose to connect crowd incentives with their chosen vehicle type. For example, more sustainable, more flexible or more spacious vehicles and the costs they bring along (such as fuel costs) can be compensated.|$|R

Further operations had been conducted in the Nui Dinh hills to west, while road operations along routes 15 and 23 demonstrated their viability, Binh Ba had been cleared of Viet Cong influence and Route 2 opened to civilian traffic. Yet the ongoing need to secure Nui Dat reduced the combat power available to the task force commander, and it was evident that with only two battalions—rather than the usual three—1 ATF lacked <b>operational</b> <b>flexibility,</b> as while one battalion carried out operations the other was required to secure the base and provide a ready reaction force.

Nonetheless evidence from on-going projects in Europe shows that many investments in skyscrapers construction fail and are abandoned in favour of low-rise high density buildings. When construction has started, tall building projects must be completed {{in order to gain}} profits and returns on investment. Due to the specific construction typology and phasing, the developer has no option to defer completion or proceed by sequential investments. On the contrary, low-rise high density buildings are characterized by high <b>operational</b> <b>flexibilities</b> as they can be expanded by sequential investments and easily modified over time in order to adapt to changes in the state variables (e. g. demand, construction costs, market prices, etc.). Investments in low-rise construction generate multiple interacting options or compounded options whose values may increase the project Net Present Value. This paper investigates the role of flexibility in high density building construction projects. We model the value of flexibility to proceed by sequential investments according to the Real Option Approach. Sequential investments can actually be seen as a series of compound and growth options, where an earlier investment cost represents the exercise price required to acquire the subsequent option to continue operating the project until the next stage comes due...|$|R

However, earlier research on this topic has not included the following: 1) a multidimensional structure that corresponds to diverse activities for supply chain management (SCM), 2) an informative explanation of how and by what means IT flexibility affects firm performance and 3) guidance to prioritise the flexibility dimensions to gain a competitive advantage. To fill these gaps, this study identified three dimensions of IT <b>flexibility,</b> namely transactional, <b>operational</b> and strategic <b>flexibility,</b> taking a systematic approach. Moreover, by combining dynamic capability (DC) and relational view (RV) theory, this study theorised a research model that links IT flexibility and firm performance. Process integration capability (PIC) was incorporated into the model as a mediator to provide a SCM research context. From the results of a partial least squares structured equation modelling (PLS SEM) analysis of 128 questionnaires from supply chain practitioners, this study validated the three IT flexibility dimensions and their hierarchical relationship. Moreover, it identified that transactional and <b>operational</b> <b>flexibilities</b> affect firm performance indirectly via PIC,while strategic flexibility directly affects firm performance. The model’s PLS SEM result was extended to an importance - performance analysis (IPA) matrix. By taking the importance and performance of each flexibility dimension as generic measurement criteria, this study prioritised the IT flexibility dimensions. Moreover, applying the same research model and methods to a specific focal firm offered a strategic way to allocate firm resources to the three IT flexibility dimensions. The theoretical contributions of this study are as follows: 1) the attainment of a multidimensional structure of IT flexibility, 2) identification of IT flexibility’s influencing mechanism on firm performance, 3) composition of DC and RV to provide a perspective on the explicit roles of IT flexibility and 4) a clear structure of the IT flexibility analysis framework within a context of SCM.
