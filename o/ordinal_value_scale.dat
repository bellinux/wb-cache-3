40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a new {{methodology}} for prioritizing threats rated with <b>ordinal</b> <b>scale</b> <b>values</b> while preserving the meaning of <b>ordinal</b> <b>values</b> and respecting the rules that govern ordinal scales. Our approach is quite novel because we present a formal algebraic system called the k/m algebra to derive the equivalence classes into which threats will be placed and define an operation called k/m dominance which orders the equivalence classes. The operations of our algebra always respect the rules that govern ordinal scales and preserve the meaning of <b>ordinal</b> <b>values.</b> We also describe and present the results from a preliminary case study where we applied our k/m algebra to prioritize threats ranked using data from an existing threat modeling system.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{offers an}} {{argument}} {{on the use}} of <b>ordinal</b> <b>values</b> in Likert <b>scale</b> that represents the linguistic terms of the level of satisfaction perceived by employers on the graduates’ performance. Generally, ordinal data are regarded as nonparametric and cannot be added. This paper recommends the use of fuzzy sets to represent linguistic terms in Likert scale. The evaluation of employers’ satisfaction level for the graduates’ performance applied the technique using fuzzy conjoint method. The investigation findings show that the analysis using fuzzy conjoint method yields consistent outcome compared to the analysis using the statistics mean and percentage. In addition, the fuzzy membership values obtained from fuzzy conjoint method ranks the attributes that used to measure employers’ satisfaction level. Therefore, this finding provides useful information for decision-making in finding the attributes that need to be enhanced in engineering graduates...|$|R
40|$|The {{attribute}} of similarity of software projects {{has not been}} the subject of in-depth studies even tough it is often used when estimating software development effort by analogy. Most of the proposed measures of projects attribute are described by numerical variables (interval, ratio or absolute scale). However, in practice many factors which describe software projects, such as the experience of programmers and the complexity of modules, are measured on the basis of an ordinal scale composed of qualifications such as `very low' and `low'. Many of these qualifications (linguistic values in fuzzy logic) of these attributes can also be represented by fuzzy sets. This will enable us to measure the similarity between software projects which are described by linguistic <b>values</b> (<b>ordinal</b> <b>scale).</b> Furthermore, the proposed measures can, of course, be also used when projects are described by numerical values.

Though originally defined by Gulliksen [1] in the 1970 s, this extension has been seldom used in subsequent research.

50|$|Thus, every ordinal {{is either}} zero, or a {{successor}} (of a well-defined predecessor), or a limit. This distinction is important, because many definitions by transfinite induction rely upon it. Very often, when defining a function F by transfinite induction on all ordinals, one defines F(0), and F(α+1) assuming F(α) is defined, and then, for limit ordinals δ one defines F(δ) as {{the limit of}} the F(β) for all β<δ (either {{in the sense of}} ordinal limits, as previously explained, or for some other notion of limit if F does not take <b>ordinal</b> <b>values).</b> Thus, the interesting step in the definition is the successor step, not the limit ordinals. Such functions (especially for F nondecreasing and taking <b>ordinal</b> <b>values)</b> are called continuous.

40|$|Malaysia is {{experiencing}} {{a major change in}} landscape development. In relation to the aim of turning Malaysia into ‘Garden Nation’, various strategies have been mapped including the campaign of greening the country through optimizing the number of tree planted over the country. Millions of trees have already been planted and many more will be planted in order to achieve a target of twenty millions of trees by the year of 2020. Despite the fact that the campaign is successfully carried out, the issue of quality for tree planting work still need to be duly addressed. The government of Malaysia under the Quality Management System (QMS) programme through Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) in the year of 2006, has established Quality Assessment System in Construction (QLASSIC) as a tool to measure the quality of construction work. QLASSIC is a system or method to measure and evaluate the quality of workmanship of a construction work based on the relevant approved standard. QLASSIC enables the quality of workmanship between construction projects to be objectively compared through a scoring system. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a set of quality assessment elements for landscape works which focusing on tree planting to be a part of an important components to facilitate QLASSIC program for landscape work. The development of quality assessment elements for tree planting was carried out through the survey on Landscape Architects' opinions on the level of Critical success factors of landscape work element. The opinion of Landscape Architects was gathered through five <b>ordinal</b> <b>value</b> or likert-type <b>scale</b> of every element. The data were then been used to develop a weightage for every element based on Contribution Weightage Formula. The findings reveal that soi 1 -mixture, root ball and planting hole are the elements that are ranked as the three most critical elements for the success of tree planting work. Finishing & treatment, staking and mulching are among the three elements that have been ranked as three lowest critical success factors for tree planting works. It is hoped that the findings would help to facilitate the QLASSIC in addressing quality assessment for landscape work. Besides, the findings can be a reference in the process of betterment the quality documents for landscape work in Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the effect of occlusal equilibration using immediate complete anterior guidance development (ICAGD) technique by Kerstein and Farrell on the subjective symptoms of myofascial pain. This technique is the most advanced verifiable and measurable way of digitally analyzing the occlusion using T-scan technology. The primary objective is to reduce the anterior disclusion time to < 0. 4 s and the secondary objective is to reduce the signs and symptoms of myofascial pain. Materials and Methods: This study is to assess the reducing effects of subjective symptoms of 100 patients diagnosed as myofascial pain patients treated by ICAGD technique as described by Kerstein and Farrell. The common complaints of the patients were a pain in the masseter and temporal muscles, jaw tiredness in the mornings, night bruxing and difficulty in chewing. In this technique occlusal equilibration involves removal of posterior interferences and establish anterior guidance. The patients were treated over three visits 1 -week apart and followed for 3 years with an interval of 3 months for the subsequent visits. A visual analog ordinal scale is used to rate the symptoms. The symptoms reduction occurred for all the patients after the first correction in about 5 - 10 days. In about a period of 3 years review, no recurrence was seen of the chronic myofascial symptoms. Results: In spite of the chronic nature of the patient′s symptoms, symptom reduction occurred in a week′s time. This was assessed by the results of the <b>ordinal</b> <b>scale</b> <b>values.</b> This agrees with the studies of Kerstein and Farrell. Conclusion: Equilibration of occlusion using digital analysis by T-scan in which force is quantified against time, should be done to establish free functional movements without any interference; otherwise the disturbances in the excursive movements may lead to muscle dysfunction at later years...|$|R

Objective: To develop and validate a scale to measure individual values for functions, which is used to weight the level of an individual patient’s functional loss and thus calculate the personal impact of disability.
