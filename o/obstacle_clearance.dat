Earlier, ten minutes had been lost to delays during the passage of Task Force J from Southampton. The I Corps planners had scheduled the landing on Nan, the eastern sector of Juno, at 07:45, 20 minutes later than on Mike, the western sector. The planners considered that Nan landing craft would require higher water to navigate among what aerial photographs suggested were underwater rocks, but later discovered that this threat had been much overestimated and {{that much of the}} shoal was actually floating seaweed. At any rate, the shallow draft of the LCAs managed the transit without trouble from the shoals, but other deeper draft landing craft types were at risk. The water had risen fast in the strong north-westerly wind. When LCA carrying assault infantry approached the beach, the crews discovered that the tide was running too high for demolition personnel to clear lanes through the beach obstacles (Demolition personnel on Juno used four LCA(OC)s, <b>Obstacle</b> <b>Clearance).</b> Consequently, landing craft had to disembark their troops among the obstacles or smash through them.|$|E

The latent reservoir of HIV- 1 in quiescent T cells {{is thought to be}} a major <b>obstacle</b> to <b>clearance</b> of infection by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Thus, identification of agents that can induce expression of latent virus may, in the presence of HAART, allow elimination of the infected cells by the immune response. We previously used the SCID-hu (Thy/Liv) mouse model to establish that activation-inducible HIV can be generated at high frequency during thymopoiesis. Latently infected mature thymocytes can be exported into the periphery, providing an efficient primary cell model to determine cellular activation signals that induce renewed expression of latent virus. Here we characterized the effects of prostratin, a non-tumor-promoting phorbol ester, on primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and assessed its ability to reactivate latent HIV infection from thymocytes and PBLs in the SCID-hu (Thy/Liv) model. Prostratin stimulation alone did not induce proliferation of quiescent PBLs; however, it could provide a secondary signal in the context of T-cell receptor stimulation or a primary activation signal in the presence of CD 28 stimulation to induce T-cell proliferation. While prostratin alone was not sufficient to allow de novo HIV infection, it efficiently reactivated HIV expression from latently infected cells generated in the SCID-hu mouse. Our data indicate that prostratin alone is able to specifically reactivate latent virus in the absence of cellular proliferation, making it an attractive candidate for further study as an adjunctive therapy for the elimination of the latent HIV reservoir...|$|R
40|$|Nano-sized {{fluorescent}} {{materials have}} demonstrated great {{potential in the}} emergent fields of nanobiotechnology and nanomedicine. To create effective probes for these applications, high brightness, photostability and size control are key parameters for particle design. Core-shell silica nanoparticles incorporating covalently bound dyes in the particle core {{have been shown to}} exhibit significant enhancements in dye brightness and photostability while allowing independent control of particle size, color and surface chemistry. 	Building on this platform, {{the first part of this}} dissertation explores a family of quantitative chemical sensors based on the incorporation of analyte-sensitive dyes into the particle shell. By co-localizing sensor and reference dye molecules onto a single particle, local analyte concentration changes can be discerned from local sensor concentration variations by comparison of the sensor and reference intensities facilitating quantitative ratiometric chemical imaging. The core-shell architecture is ideal for this application because it sequesters the reference dye in the particle core, while allowing analyte interactions with the sensor dyes near the particle surface. Traditional Stober-derived sol-gel routes as well as reverse micelle-based methods were employed to generate pH- and Ca+ 2 -sensitive nanoparticles. Specific sensor architectures were applied to intracellular as well as large-scale functional volumetric imaging of intact biofilms and their metabolic activities.

40|$|Abstract — Maintaining clearance, or {{distance}} from obstacles, {{is a vital}} component of successful motion planning algorithms. Maintaining high clearance often creates safer paths for robots. Contemporary sampling-based planning algorithms that utilize the medial axis, or the set of all points equidistant to two or more <b>obstacles,</b> produce higher <b>clearance</b> paths. However, they are biased heavily toward certain portions of the medial axis, sometimes ignoring parts critical to planning, e. g., specific types of narrow passages. We introduce Uniform Medial Axis Probabilistic RoadMap (UMAPRM), a novel planning variant that generates samples uniformly on the medial axis of the free portion of Cspace. We theoretically analyze the distribution generated by UMAPRM and show its uniformity. Our results show that UMAPRM’s distribution of samples along the medial axis is not only uniform but also preferable to other medial axis samplers in certain planning problems. We demonstrate that UMAPRM has negligible computational overhead over other sampling techniques and can solve problems the others could not, e. g., a bug trap. Finally, we demonstrate UMAPRM successfully generates higher clearance paths in the examples. I...|$|R

We studied such influences on body orientation and foot trajectory control during level walking and obstacle avoidance. Six young adults {{walked on the}} level and over an obstacle while vision was present or occluded as well as while vestibular information was intact or perturbed using galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS). The occlusion of vision caused a slowing of gait during obstacle avoidance {{as well as in}}creased clearance of the leading limb over the obstruction. GVS caused lateral deviations in head and trunk roll angles as well as in foot and trunk displacements, but these lateral deviations were the same during both level walking and obstacle avoidance. In addition, GVS had no effect at all on sagittal plane factors such as speed, foot proximity to the <b>obstacle</b> and vertical <b>clearance</b> over the <b>obstacle.</b> Overall, there is a complex visual control of bilateral obstacle avoidance, but the lack of differences in GVS effects between level and obstructed walking shows that vestibular information is not upregulated for obstacle avoidance.

40|$|Interest in impact {{vibrations}} is two-fold: (i) a {{wide range}} ofpractical problems involve bodies colliding with one another or/and with obstacles, and (ii) the complex dynamics of such problems is a good testing bench for nonlinear theories. The assumption of rigid stop isquite popular, although unfortunately it does {{not allow us to}} simulate the actual dissipative character of the impact response, but via apriori fixed coefficient of restitution. However, the correct description of the energy dissipated during impact is very important. In this paper, the dynamic response of a single-degree-of-freedoms ystem is studied, where hysteretic stop, which allows the simulation ofthe real behaviour of {{a wide range}} of material pairings, is assumed; a distinction between hard and soft contacts is made according to theimpulsive or non impulsive nature of the contact reaction. The evolution through stable closed orbits and period-doubling routes to chaos are studied in terms of the clearance between the mass in the initial placeand the <b>obstacle.</b> For different <b>clearances,</b> strange attractors are revealed and their evolution illustrated. Furthermore, in the case of hard contact, an equivalent coefficient of restitution is proposed which depends, in a simple way, on some characteristic parameters of the hysteretic contact law.

Recent studies have focused on searches for adjuvant therapies to activate this reservoir under conditions of HAART. Prostratin, a non tumor-promoting phorbol ester, is a candidate for such a strategy. Prostratin has been shown to reactivate latent HIV- 1 and Tat-mediated transactivation may {{play an important role in}} this process. We examined resting CD 4 + T cells from healthy donors to determine if prostratin induces Cyclin T 1 /P-TEFb, a cellular kinase composed of Cyclin T 1 and Cyclin-dependent kinase- 9 (CDK 9) that mediates Tat function. We also examined effects of prostratin on Cyclin T 2 a, an alternative regulatory subunit for CDK 9, and 7 SK snRNA and the HEXIM 1 protein, two factors that associate with P-TEFb and repress its kinase activity. Results: Prostratin up-regulated Cyclin T 1 protein expression, modestly induced CDK 9 protein expression, and did not affect Cyclin T 2 a protein expression. Although the kinase activity of CDK 9 in vitro was up-regulated by prostratin, we observed a large increase in the association of 7 SK snRNA and the HEXIM 1 protein with CDK 9.
