5|$|Hitler was {{appointed}} Chancellor <b>of</b> <b>Germany</b> by the President of the Weimar Republic Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933.

Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator <b>of</b> <b>Germany</b> by merging the powers and offices of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole Führer (leader) <b>of</b> <b>Germany.</b> All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became above all laws. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In {{the midst of the}} Great Depression, the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy. Extensive public works were undertaken, including the construction of Autobahnen (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.|$|E
