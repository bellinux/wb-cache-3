50|$|It gets metabolized in {{the liver}} to <b>oxfendazole,</b> which is {{anthelmintic}} too; <b>oxfendazole</b> partially gets reduced back to fenbendazole {{in the liver}} and rumen. Also, fenbendazole itself is an active metabolite of another anthelmintic drug, febantel.|$|E
50|$|The fly breeds {{in large}} numbers in dung pads. Larvae {{have been found in}} the feces of large mammals. The species {{continually}} breeds in subtropical Australia, and migrations help repopulate Australia and Tasmania each spring. In a study, a mixture of levamisole and <b>oxfendazole</b> killed larvae in sheep feces.|$|E
50|$|Infection is {{directly}} diagnosed by identifying proglottids in the faeces, or adult worms in the intestine upon autopsy. Broad-spectrum anthelmintics such as albendazole, fenbendazole, praziquantel, <b>oxfendazole</b> and niclosamide are all effective against the different species. The most effective control measure is {{disruption of the}} habitat of intermediate hosts near poultry farms.|$|E
50|$|Broad {{spectrum}} anthelmintics {{are also}} effective against adult worms and larvae. There are several benzimidazoles {{were successful in}} clearing infection, including albendazole, febantel, fenbendazole, <b>oxfendazole.</b> Moreover, levamisole and several macrocyclic lactones (e.g. abamectin, doramectin, eprinomectin, ivermectin, moxidectin) are reported to be effective. After multiple rounds of exposure adult ruminants can overcome the adverse effects of the parasite however still it act as reservoir for new infection.|$|E
50|$|Both <b>oxfendazole</b> and {{fenbendazole}} are efficacious against gastrointestinal lungworms and roundworms of livestock, adults, and L4-larvae of {{the significant}} species for example, of the genera Bunostomum, Haemonchus, Ostertagia, Oesophagostomum, Nematodirus, Teladorsagia, Cooperia, Trichostrongylus, Dictyocaulus, Trichuris, etc., including against arrested larvae {{of some of the}} species. They are even highly efficient against majority of the livestock tapeworms. This drug works effectively against the main parasitic roundworms and tapeworms of dogs and cats.|$|E
50|$|Infection is {{diagnosed}} by identifying proglottids in the faeces. Dibutyltin dilaurate {{is one of}} the earliest drugs found to be effective. Commercially, praziquantel (such as Ezotec® 10 at the dosage of 6.00 mg/kg of body weight, in a single dose) is the drug of choice. It is 100% effective at 10 mg/kg and is well tolerated by chickens, and treated birds showed no clinical complications at various doses tested. <b>Oxfendazole</b> and niclosamide are equally effective and safe. The most effective control measure is disruption of the habitat of intermediate hosts near poultry farms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxfendazole</b> is an {{anthelmintic}} (wormer) compound used in veterinary practice. It {{comes under}} the chemical {{class of the}} benzimidazoles. This drug is barely used in horses, goats, sheep, and cattle. It is very scarcely applied on dogs and cats. The drug for livestock is majorly available {{in the form of}} pills, tablets, drenches, bolus, etc. They are meant for oral consumption. Several drenches are allowed for intraruminal injection in some of the countries. Few countries also prefer injectables and pour-ons. For pet dogs, the drug is available in the form of drenches.|$|E
50|$|The {{intervention}} strategies to eradicate cysticercosis includes surveillance of pigs in foci of transmission and massive chemotherapy treatment of humans. In reality, control of T. solium {{by a single}} intervention, for instance, by treating only human population will not work because the existing infected pigs can still carry on the cycle. The proposed strategy for eradication is to do multilateral intervention by treating both human and porcine populations. It is feasible because treatment pigs with <b>oxfendazole</b> {{have been shown to}} be effective and once treated, they are protected from further infections for at least 3 months.|$|E
50|$|Even {{with the}} {{concurrent}} treatment {{of humans and}} pigs, complete elimination is hard to achieve. In one study conducted in 12 villages in Peru, both humans and porcine were treated with praziquantel and <b>oxfendazole,</b> with the coverage of more than 75% in humans and 90% in pigs The result shows a decrease in prevalence and incidence in the intervention area; however the effect did not completely eliminate T. solium. The possible reason includes the incomplete coverage and re-infection. Even though T. solium could be eliminated through mass treatment of human and porcine population, it is not sustainable. Moreover, both tapeworm carriers of humans and pigs tend to spread the disease from endemic to non-endemic areas resulting in periodic outbreaks of cysticercosis or outbreaks in new areas.|$|E
40|$|A blinded, {{randomized}} placebo-controlled trial {{assessed the}} efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>oxfendazole</b> {{for the treatment of}} ovine hydatid disease. Cyst fertility and parasite viability were measured following daily, weekly, and monthly treatment schedules with 30 mg of <b>oxfendazole</b> per kg of body weight. The 12 -week trial was conducted in 215 adult sheep in the central Peruvian Andes and was masked for both treatment group and scheduling. In this trial <b>oxfendazole</b> significantly reduced protoscolex viability relative to controls in all treatment groups. In the daily, weekly, and monthly groups, 100, 97, and 78 % of sheep, respectively, were either cured or improved following treatment, compared to 35 % cured or improved animals in the control group. However, daily dosing at 30 mg of <b>oxfendazole</b> per kg proved highly toxic to sheep, resulting in a 24 % death rate in the daily group as compared to a 4 to 6 % mortality rate in all other groups. If found safe in humans, <b>oxfendazole</b> may prove to be a useful and inexpensive treatment for cestode infections in humans. This study suggests that a staggered dosing regimen of <b>oxfendazole,</b> and possibly other benzimidazoles, may be as efficacious as daily treatment regimens for hydatidosis while decreasing both the cost and adverse effects associated with daily dosing...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOxfendazole, methyl- 5 (6) -phenylsulfinyl- 2 -{{benzimidazole}} carbamate, is {{a member}} of the benzimidazole family of anthelmintics. Anthelmintic benzimidazoles are widely used in meat producing animals (cattle, sheep and pigs) for control of endoparasites. The extensive use of veterinary drugs in food-producing animals can cause the presence of small quantities of the drug residues in food. Maximum residue limit or "MRL" means the maximum concentration of residue resulting from the use of a veterinary medicinal product which may be legally permitted recognized as acceptable in food. The FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (1999) evaluations of toxicological and residue data, reported that <b>oxfendazole</b> (MRL) has toxicological hazards on human health. The toxicity of <b>oxfendazole</b> (MRL) was tested in male and female mice and their fetuses. Chromosomal aberrations, teratological examination and biochemical analysis were the parameters used in this study. The results show that <b>oxfendazole</b> MRL induced a mutagenic effect in all tested cell types. Also, <b>oxfendazole</b> exhibit embryotoxicity including teratogenicity. The biochemical results show that <b>oxfendazole</b> induced a disturbance in the different biochemical contents of all tested tissues. So, we must increase the attention paid to the potential risk of <b>oxfendazole</b> residues in human beings and should stress the need for careful control to ensure adherence to the prescribed withdrawal time of this drug...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{efficacy}} of a single oral dose of benzimidazoles against Trichuris spp. infections in humans and animals is poor, but is currently still used in control programmes against human trichuriasis. However, the route of the benzimidazoles from the treated host to Trichuris remains unknown. As parts of adult Trichuris are situated intracellularly in the caecum, they might be exposed to anthelmintic drugs in the intestinal content as well as the mucosa. In this study, the pathway of <b>oxfendazole</b> and its metabolites was explored using a T. suis-pig infection model, by simultaneously measuring drug concentrations within the worms and the caecal mucosa, caecal tissue, caecal content and plasma of pigs over time after a single oral dose of 5  mg/kg <b>oxfendazole.</b> Additionally, for comparison to the in vivo study, drug uptake and metabolism of <b>oxfendazole</b> by T. suis was examined after in vitro incubation. <b>Oxfendazole</b> and metabolites were quantified by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed a strong and highly significant association between OFZ concentrations within T. suis and in plasma, along with a weaker association between OFZ concentrations in caecal tissue/mucosa and T. suis, suggesting that <b>oxfendazole</b> reaches T. suis after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and enters the worms by the blood-enterocyte pathway. The fenbendazole sulfone level in T. suis was highly affected by the concentrations in plasma. In addition, correlations between drug concentrations in the host compartments, were generally highest for this metabolite. In comparison to <b>oxfendazole,</b> the correlation between plasma and content was particularly high for this metabolite, suggesting a high level of drug movement between these compartments and the possible involvement of the enterohepatic circulation.

40|$|Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) is a near-cosmopolitan {{parasitic}} zoonosis {{that causes}} economic losses {{in many regions}} of the world. This parasitic infection {{can be regarded as}} an emerging or re-emerging disease causing considerable losses in livestock production. CE is produced by the larval cystic stage (hydatid) of the dog parasite Echinococcus granulosus. After infective eggs are ingested, cysts develop mainly in lungs and liver of humans and animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, horses, etc). Infected people may require surgery and/or Albendazole-based chemotherapy. In this study, we evaluated the effects of <b>Oxfendazole</b> alone (an antiparasitic drug used in animals), <b>Oxfendazole</b> plus Praziquantel, and Albendazole plus Praziquantel against hydatid cysts in sheep over 4 to 6 weeks of treatment. All of the treatments in this study were efficacious in killing the larval stages and, therefore, in minimizing the risk of a dog acquiring new infections (taenias).

Both compounds are metabolized at the sulphur atom via two sequential oxidations, {{first to the}} sulphoxide (aldicarb sulphoxide and <b>oxfendazole,</b> respectively) {{and then to the}} sulphone. <b>Oxfendazole</b> and fenbendazole sulphone from FBZ, and aldicarb sulphoxide from ALD were found in both species. Aldicarb sulphone was not produced by the hepatocyte preparations from the bullock. The good correlation obtained comparing the in vitro results of FBZ metabolism with published in vivo data obtained on FBZ kinetics in the same species confirmed the usefulness of in vitro models for predictive analysis of in vivo xenobiotic biotransformation...|$|E
