25|$|Historically, lensing {{analyses}} were conducted on galaxy clusters detected via their baryon content (e.g. from optical or X-ray surveys).

40|$|Preliminary xylem sap {{composition}} {{studies were}} conducted in February 2004 using Cabernet sauvignon and Pinot noir grapevines growing in Placerville (cold winter temperature) and UC Davis (warmer temperatures). The pH of xylem sap from both varieties was almost a full unit lower in vines grown in cold temperatures versus warm. A similar trend also occurred with sap osmolarity, however the differences were not as great. Because these vines were grown under different management practices and on different rootstocks these results must be considered preliminary. In 2004 we established four field sites in Shasta, Placer, Mendocino and Yolo counties to repeat these measurements on clonal vines that were grown in 5 -gallon pots <b>at</b> University <b>of</b> <b>California,</b> <b>Davis.</b> One-half <b>of</b> the vines were inoculated with Xf while the other half is un-inoculated controls.

40|$|People with flu-like {{symptoms}} {{who seek}} treatment at a medical clinic or hospital often must wait {{several hours before}} being examined, possibly exposing many people to an infectious virus. If a patient appears to need more than the routine fluids-and-rest prescription, effective diagnosis requires tests that must be sent to a laboratory. Hours or days may pass before results are available to the doctor, who in the meantime must make an educated guess about the patient's illness. The lengthy diagnostic process places a heavy burden on medical laboratories and can result in improper use of antibiotics or a costly hospital stay. A faster testing method may soon be available. An assay developed {{by a team of}} Livermore scientists can diagnose influenza and other respiratory viruses in about two hours once a sample has been taken. Unlike other systems that operate this quickly, the new device, called FluIDx (and pronounced ''fluidics''), can differentiate five types of respiratory viruses, including influenza. FluIDx can analyze samples at the point of patient care [...] in hospital emergency departments and clinics [...] allowing medical providers to quickly determine how best to treat a patient, saving time and potentially thousands of dollars per patient. The FluIDx project, which is led by Livermore chemist Mary McBride of the Physics and Advanced Technologies Directorate, received funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) Program. To test the system and make it as useful as possible, the team worked closely with the Emergency Department staff <b>at</b> the University <b>of</b> <b>California</b> (UC) <b>at</b> <b>Davis</b> Medical Center in Sacramento. Flu kills more than 35, 000 people every year in the US. The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome and the ongoing concern about a possible bird flu pandemic show the need for a fast, reliable test that can differentiate seasonal flu from a potentially pandemic influenza. Such a test should also discriminate influenza from pathogens that cause illnesses with flu-like symptoms. When a precise diagnosis is required to treat an adult patient with serious respiratory symptoms, sample cells are usually obtained with a nasal or throat swab and analyzed with one of several laboratory methods. The gold standard test is viral culturing, a highly sensitive method that can identify the specific strain of virus. However, viral culturing is a labor-intensive process and requires 3 - 10 days to produce results, too long for early intervention. Enzyme and optical immunoassays offer results in 30 minutes, but these methods are less sensitive than viral culturing so they can produce false positives or negatives. They also cannot distinguish the type of virus found. Direct immunofluorescence antibody (DFA) staining is as sensitive as viral culturing. It also can detect multiple respiratory pathogens simultaneously by a process known as multiplexing. However, DFA staining requires expensive equipment, a skilled microscopist, and samples with enough target cells for testing. In addition, the results are ultimately subjective. Another method, called reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay, offers sensitivity and specificity comparable to viral culturing and DFA staining. It also produces results in two hours and can rapidly test a large number of samples. The drawback with these tests, however, is that they must be performed in a laboratory. None of them can be used where they are needed most: in the clinic or emergency department where patients are being treated. Livermore's FluIDx diagnostic system, with its instrumentation and multiplexed assays, is designed specifically for point-of-care diagnosis. The fast, easy-to-use system is based on the Autonomous Pathogen Detection System, a homeland security technology developed by LLNL. This R&D 100 Award-winning technology constantly monitors the air to detect airborne bioterrorism agents, such as anthrax. FluIDx is an integrated system designed to perform highly multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic-acid-based assays in real time. The FluIDx system processes a sample, analyzes the data, reports the results, and decontaminates itself before another sample is taken. The device currently uses 16 assays [...] 12 for individual nucleic-acid targets and 4 for internal controls. The assays can simultaneously detect influenza A and B, parainfluenza (Types 1 and 3), respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus (Groups B, C, and E) ...|$|R

Elaine de kooning was also part of the New York School scene. Which included Jackson Pollack as well as Willem de Kooning. Elaine de Kooning was an important writer and teacher on art. She began working at the magazine Artnews in 1948, and wrote articles about major figures in the art world. She wrote about one hundred articles to the Art News magazine. Elaine de Kooning was the first American artist in the 1950s to take a role of the artists critic. [...] "As an writer, she wrote about culture, art, and new ideas to her generation of artists and readers." [...] Although Elaine was a successful writer, she considered herself a [...] "painter by nature." [...] Elaine de kooning’s art and writing were all devoted to art and humanity. Over the course of her life, she held teaching posts at many institutions of higher education.

In 1985 she was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full academician in 1988. [...] A painting to me is primarily a verb, not a noun, an event first and only secondarily an image.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{antibodies}} {{have been developed}} that induce lethal iron deprivation (LID) by targeting the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR 1 /CD 71) and either neutralizing transferrin (Tf) binding, blocking internalization of the receptor and/or inducing its degradation. We have developed recombinant antibodies targeting human TfR 1 (ch 128. 1 and ch 128. 1 Av), which induce receptor degradation and are cytotoxic to certain malignant B-cells. We now show that internalization of TfR 1 bound to these antibodies can lead to its sequestration and degradation, as well as reduced Tf uptake, and the induction of a transcriptional response consistent with iron deprivation, which is mediated in part by downstream targets of p 53. Cells resistant to these antibodies do not sequester and degrade TfR 1 after internalization of the antibody/receptor complex, and accordingly maintain their ability to internalize Tf. These findings are expected to facilitate the rational design and clinical use of therapeutic agents targeting iron import via TfR 1 in hematopoietic malignancies.
