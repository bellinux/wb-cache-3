25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E
500|$|After his {{political}} career, Marshall became {{more interested in}} writing. He frequently contributed content to the state's newspapers and occasionally wrote poetry. He founded the American Republic, the only Federalist newspaper in the state, and published its first issue on June 26, 1810. Newspapers sympathetic to the Democratic-Republicans soon derided the American Republic as [...] "The Snake". Undaunted, Marshall added a rattlesnake and the inscription [...] "Tread Not <b>On</b> <b>Me.</b> <b>For</b> My Country." [...] to the paper's masthead. Marshall soon changed {{the name of the}} paper to the Harbinger, and eventually sold it to Patrick Darby in 1825. Darby immediately changed the name of the newspaper again, dubbing it the Constitutional Advocate.|$|E
500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E

In late August 2012, Welch told Style magazine that she plans to take a twelve-month hiatus before starting work on the band's next studio album, stating, [...] "There's a big 'take a year off' plan.

2500|$|Police held Verburgh for 48hours of questionings and beatings that {{severely}} injured him, including a separated shoulder. Throughout, Verburgh denied {{involvement in the}} murder. Verburgh's Janitor Union lawyer got Verburgh released on a writ of habeas corpus. Verburgh said of the experience:Oh, they hanged me up, they blindfolded me ... I can't put up my arms, they are sore. They had handcuffs <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> hours and hours. They threw me in the cell and blindfolded me. They handcuffed my hands behind my back and pulled me up on bars until my toes touched the floor. I no eat, I go to the hospital. Oh, I am so sick.

2500|$|National media {{attention}} {{was given to}} a 15-second video clip that appeared to show Corwin's Assembly chief of staff, Michael Mallia, repeatedly asking the 78-year-old Davis why he had skipped a campaign debate, followed by Mallia shrieking as Davis apparently shoved him or flapped at the camera. The video clip was circulated by local and national Republican organizations and prompted bipartisan criticism of both Davis and Mallia. Requests to see a longer tape and a tape made by second camera were refused by Corwin and her campaign. In {{an interview with the}} National Journal, Corwin said she thought the video was self-explanatory, and indicated that Mallia had been acting on his own free time, and not as her employee while he was tracking and taping her opponent, Davis. In response to Davis' complaints that he had been harassed, Corwin said, [...] "I've had cameras <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> two months now, and I've never hit anybody ... and I think that's the difference is how you handle a situation like that." [...] One week after the election, Mallia resigned his position as Corwin's chief of staff {{as a result of the}} controversy.|$|E
2500|$|I {{appeal to}} any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, {{and he gave}} him not meat; if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not. During {{the course of the}} last long and bloody war, Logan {{remained}} idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, Logan is the friend of the white men. I have even thought to live with you but for the injuries of one man. Col. Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood, and unprovoked, murdered all the relations of Logan, not sparing even my women and children. [...] There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This has called <b>on</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many: I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. [...] But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.|$|E
