50|$|The 650 {{instructions}} {{consisted of}} a two-digit <b>operation</b> <b>code,</b> a four-digit data address and the four-digit address of the next instruction. The sign was ignored on the basic machine, but was used on machines with optional features. The base machine had 44 <b>operation</b> <b>codes.</b> Additional <b>operation</b> <b>codes</b> were provided for options, such as floating point, core storage, index registers and additional I/O devices.

50|$|The {{system had}} two {{instruction}} formats: Standard, 16-bit instructions, and Extended, 32-bit instructions. Standard instructions had a 6-bit <b>operation</b> <b>code,</b> a two-bit index register identifier, and an 8-bit PC-relative address. Extended instructions had a 6-bit <b>operation</b> <b>code,</b> a two-bit index register identifier, an 8-bit <b>operation</b> <b>code</b> modifier, and a 16-bit memory address. Indirect addressing was allowed.|$|R

50|$|Each machine {{instruction}} in memory occupies one word, {{and consists of}} 4 parts: the address (2 bytes and {{the sign of the}} word) in memory to read or write; an index specification (1 byte, describing which rI index register to use) to add to the address; a modification (1 byte) that specifies which parts of the register or memory location will be read or altered; and the <b>operation</b> <b>code</b> (1 byte). All <b>operation</b> <b>codes</b> have an associated mnemonic.|$|R
50|$|The {{register}} set {{is in the}} visible address space. Registers appear {{to exist in the}} first 128 words (2008) of the current instruction bank (B0) when referenced as a data item. This does impose a restriction on compilers to not place any data constants in the first 128 words of a code bank. The result of this is an expansion of the instruction set without requiring additional <b>operation</b> <b>codes.</b> Register-to-register <b>operations</b> are accomplished with the register-storage <b>operation</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The ISA manual {{recommends}} that software be optimized to avoid branch stalls {{by using the}} default branch predictions. This reuses the most significant bit of the signed relative address as a [...] "hint bit" [...] to tell whether the conditional branch will be taken or not. So, no other hint bits are needed in the <b>operation</b> <b>codes</b> of RISC-V branches. This makes more bits available in the branch <b>operation</b> <b>codes.</b> Simple, inexpensive CPUs can merely follow the default predictions and still perform well with optimizing compilers. Compilers can still perform statistical path optimization, if desired.|$|R

Adoption of mixed scheduling for belief propagation decoding has shown to be very effective in solving some of the trapping sets.
