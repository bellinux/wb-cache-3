5000|$|In this book, {{the author}} {{analyses}} {{the influence of}} geographical and social determinants (structure of <b>ownership,</b> <b>relation</b> to authority, the influence of traditional structures) on the vote of the inhabitants of fifteen departments in western France. He thus compares different territorial units by postulating {{that there is a}} correlation between the social structures that are anchored in the local geography and the behaviour of the voters. Under this approach, and based on an old French saying that [...] "the limestone gave the teacher and granite the priest", Siegfried then establishes a direct relationship between the geography of the Vendée and the vote of the people. In the geological division of the territory (in the north of the department, the granite bocage, to the south the calcareous plain), it is possible to superimpose according to him a division of the electoral behaviours. The very nature of the granitic soil favours the dispersal of the habitation, the rurality, the large landed property and Catholicism. All these factors, arising indirectly from the nature of the soil, may contribute to explaining the right-wing vote in northern Vendée at the time. On the contrary, the limestone soil favours a more restricted habitat, urbanity, small property and petite bourgeoisie. The role of the Church is less central in these areas. So the data may explain that the south of the Vendée department voted then (during {{the first years of the}} Third Republic) to the political left, that is to say in contrast to the north of the department. This work also explains the partition of the Vendée between the Republican south and the monarchist north during the French Revolution.|$|E

But can the computational perspective offer anything in return? I will explore this question by focusing on the concept of OWNERSHIP, which has been debated in the jurisprudential literature for centuries. Although the intellectual currents here flow mostly in one direction — from legal philosophy to AI — I will show that there are also some insights to be gained from a computational analysis of the <b>OWNERSHIP</b> <b>relation.</b> In particular, the article suggests a computational explanation for the emergence of abstract property rights, divorced from concrete material objects...|$|E

40|$|The Universe type {{system allows}} a {{programmer}} to control aliasing and dependencies in objectoriented programs by applying an <b>ownership</b> <b>relation</b> to structure the object store.

The main part of this master project is to design and implement the runtime support for Uniqueness (and ownership transfer) and for generic types. From Java 5 generic types are introduced. Java does not store the runtime type of the type arguments. But the Universe type system needs this information for its runtime model. Based on GUT [[2], [3]] which defines the runtime model for generic types in the Universe type system the current runtime implementation in the multijava [11] compiler is now extended by an implementation for this runtime model.

40|$|Memory {{management}} system performance is of increasing impor-tance in today’s managed languages. Two lingering sources of over-head are the direct costs of memory allocations and write barriers. This paper introduces allocation folding, an optimization technique where the virtual machine automatically folds multiple memory al-location operations in optimized code {{together into a}} single, larger allocation group. An allocation group comprises multiple objects and requires just a single bounds check in a bump-pointer style allo-cation, rather than a check for each individual object. More impor-tantly, all objects allocated in a single allocation group are guaran-teed to be contiguous after allocation and thus exist in the same gen-eration, which {{makes it possible to}} statically remove write barriers for reference stores involving objects in the same allocation group. Unlike object inlining, object fusing, and object colocation, alloca-tion folding requires no special connectivity or <b>ownership</b> <b>relation</b> between the objects in an allocation group. We present our analysis algorithm to determine when it is safe to fold allocations together and discuss our implementation in V 8, an open-source, production JavaScript virtual machine. We present performance results for the Octane and Kraken benchmark suites and show that allocation fold-ing is a strong performance improvement, even in the presence of some heap fragmentation. Additionally, we use four hand-selected benchmarks JPEGEncoder, NBody, Soft 3 D, and Textwriter where allocation folding has a large impact...|$|E

The source of basic fact and concept of woman-man relationship to which "love" is related; the root and qualities of moral tradition and opinions {{can be seen from}} the "creation" narrations of holy books and various precepts. Some "creation" narration and myths tells about the creation of a woman named "Lilith" before Eve. In a creation story belonging to the 2000 BC, when she was first seen, Lilith, being the goddess of the matriarchal period and expelled from the patriarchal Sumerian world, is seen as an excluded character in the scripts of Cabala doctrines, too. In narrations and compositions, excluding the "powerful-subject" woman image from social life and rendering acceptable the woman identity which is dependent on a "power" composed of God-government-man, Lilith and Eve show mythological figure features symbolizing the opposite poles of woman identity and "morals. " In works of art performing the progressive events which come up with the persuasion of a living creature, which is the combination of snake-Devil-woman(Lilith) in holy scripts, Eve about the "forbidden fruit", two characters are reflected with the imagery of contrasts representing hostility. In the descriptions of some works of art illustrating the art playing a part in the service of "gender ideology" and in modern digital-fantastic descriptions, a connection between the women and misdeed is made explicit with figures composed of snake-woman. Man gender of mankind building an <b>ownership</b> <b>relation</b> with the universe develops "dominance" in a more complicated way against its female and urged the woman to be either Lilith or Eve; and he was in the shadow of the unreal "power-strength" imagery.

Penetration of business into the education system and its commercialization has two main implications. The first one is positive. Private sector specifies requirements for degree courses and employability of graduates in the natural way. The negative implication is the penetration of property and <b>ownership</b> <b>relations</b> in order to profit rather than to provide quality education. The paper deals with the relations between business entities operating in the segment of private schools, mutual penetration of individual entities and with <b>ownership</b> <b>relations.</b> The aim is to uncover <b>ownership</b> <b>relations</b> and making them transparent. This can lead to substantial savings in funding. By finding linkages between entities, ownership priorities can be revealed and prioritization of profit over the education can be prevented.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} and implement how a specific form of IoT, sensors, can be integrated with BIM {{in order to improve}} the building performance, when the perspective taken is the end-users. It seeks to explore different perceived values of BIM and sensor integration for the occupants who directly use the building facilities. The thesis also describes the concept, frameworks and cases of how BIM and sensors integration can be setup. These are used for an implementation at a case facility. Three main methods are used – literature review, comparative case study, and a smallscale implementation, containing a survey and sensor implementation based on the respondents’ satisfaction with the office air quality. A basic literature review is used to gather the fundamental concepts used within the relevant areas, and to review the empirical research connected to these. The conceptual part of the thesis review frameworks for BIM and sensor integration, and points toward a more user-centric framework that is later developed in relation to the thesis’ empirical results. The theoretical framework integrates Information Systems Theories with Knowledge Management for a framework of understanding how knowledge about new kinds of Information Systems in developing areas function. The empirical part of the thesis is structured into two main phases, one descriptive comparative case study, and the other an implementation based in the first phase results. The first phase is descriptive, where two cases of sensor and BIM implementation processes for FM are described. The main case of Tyréns company (Tyréns), and a reference case of Mästerhuset is used for understanding how different organizational structures may lead to different perceived values and processes of BIM and sensor integration for the end-users. The second phase is an implementation at the main case, Tyréns’ headquarter building. Here the end-user perspective is employed with a survey that is constructed in accordance with some of the fundamental concepts and research reviewed, in order to measure the perceived satisfaction with the air quality of the end-users working environment. The answers show concerns with air quality in the meeting rooms, and this is used as the basis for a small-scale implementation of sensors, where CO 2 and temperature sensors are set up. The results show how different organizational-specific conditions generate different perceived values of BIM and sensor integration depending on <b>ownership</b> <b>relation</b> to the end-users. The case study also illustrate the different processes of BIM and sensor integration may be setup to supplement building performance. This points to a needed add-on into frameworks that conceptualizes BIM and sensor integration without the inclusion of the end-users’ perspective. Based on this an end-user conceptual framework of BIM and sensors is proposed with the supplementary part of a knowledge layer, named analytic layer and data source from occupants...|$|E

40|$|During {{the period}} of realizing {{innovative}} and investment model of development of Ukraine some changes, primarily {{in the sphere of}} basic economic <b>relations,</b> namely <b>ownership</b> <b>relations,</b> take place. The diversity of ownership and organizational and legal forms of management enhances economic independence and freedom of the subjects. Also it creates favourable conditions for innovative entrepreneurship activity, heightens the competitiveness of the national economy. Consequently, the appropriate changes occur in the course of implementation of innovative-investment model of development in Ukraine. Especially in the field of basic economic <b>relations,</b> i. e. <b>ownership</b> <b>relations.</b> Within the establishment process of socially oriented relationships harmonization of ownership of industrial enterprises of the national economy is critical to economic growth and technological progress of the country. At the same time, the innovative nature of economy is considered to be the channel for harmonization of <b>ownership</b> <b>relations</b> in industry. And their optimal structure is the cultural environment of implementation of innovative socially oriented model of development. Peculiarity of the harmonization problem of <b>ownership</b> <b>relations</b> is defined by the necessity of a reproduction model formation based on the new technologies application. It requires the exclusive activity of the state in questions of organization and promotion, or sometimes investors’ participation in priority areas. In this case their restructuring acts as the tool of <b>ownership</b> <b>relations</b> harmonization in the state. The difference of strategies and methods for converting the ownership structure in different countries confirms the absence of a universal model implementation due to the tact that individual objectives and conditions of each state economy are individual. Foreign experience led to the conclusion that downturn change of GDP and GNP on economic growth is due to the restructuring of ownership in the countries that chose the path of innovative development. It means that their reference point is scientific and technological progress and high-tech manufacturing. Sustainable economic development is ensured and organically linked to the quality of growth, optimization of ownership, the formation of new organizational forms of capital concentration also. While the state {{plays a key role in}} the reason of the market mechanisms in its infancy have insufficient regulatory action. Besides, if restructuring acts in the context of innovative and socially-oriented aspects as unavoidable stage of economic transition in order to achieve sustainable economic growth, than the change in the structure of ownership, the formation of the private mode of appropriation is a method of transformation of the system of social relations of Ukraine and institutional type of structural changes. Proceeding from this, if has been suggested to actualize the subject of the need for structural optimization of <b>ownership</b> <b>relations</b> in Ukraine exactly now during the implementation of innovative investment model of development in the context of socially-oriented economy. The block scheme proposed based on the rule of the golden section and the law of analogy, and allows considering the possibility of state ownership to eliminate certain socioeconomic differences, as well as to concentrate the sufficient resources level for the implementation of major innovation projects and to control most of economic resources by deriving them from the aegis of private capital and thus, to overcome the negative characteristics, and legging behind in the field of national economy development...|$|R

We examine the different <b>ownership</b> <b>relations</b> of processing factories and the percieved benefits of these different arrangements. We are looking to explore the challenges and opportunities provided by each of these different <b>ownership</b> <b>relations</b> and the possibilities for sustainability. Specifically we ask: 1) Which type of ownership arrangement is more likely to engage in Fairtrade certification? 2) Do perceived benefits from Fairtrade certification increase with the percentage of ownership shares? and 3) What aspects of these organizational relations have resulted in more sustainable relationships between growers and processors? We use descriptive qualitative analysis to identify the significance between factory ownership organization and scheme success. This also allows us to discuss participants' perceptions of the benefits of each scheme. We find that there is a movement towards innovation in the organizational strategies for linking growers to tea processing factories in Tanzania. This innovation includes new ownership arrangements of processing factories and outgrower contracts that have been associated with certified Fairtrade production.
