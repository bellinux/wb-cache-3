[...] In the subzero cold, Rangel was injured in the back by shrapnel from a Chinese shell. [...] He later wrote that the blast threw him into a ditch and caused him to pray fervently to Jesus. [...] Up and down the line of the retreat, unit cohesion disappeared under attack and officers lost contact with their men. [...] There was screaming and moaning around him and some U.S. soldiers were being taken prisoner, but despite feeling overwhelming fear Rangel resolved to try to escape over an imposing mountain: [...] "From the rim of that gully it just looked like everything had to be better on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> damn mountain." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} {{received}} generally mixed to negative reviews. Many critics said {{the series was}} too similar to The Office and its mock documentary style. In particular, several commentators said the naive and well-meaning Leslie Knope character too closely resembled The Office protagonist Michael Scott, the well-intentioned but dimwitted manager of a paper company sales office. Maureen Ryan, television reviewer for the Chicago Tribune, said Parks and Recreation surpassed the Friends spin-off Joey as the [...] "worst example of NBC's tendency to extend its franchises well beyond what is desirable or logical." [...] Daniels said of the comparisons between Leslie Knope and Michael Scott, [...] "My sense {{is that if we}} had built 'Parks and Recreation' around a 90-year-old Maasai warrior people would still have said, 'He reminds me of [...] Michael Scott'. There was just no way to escape it." [...] Poehler acknowledged that there was some validity to the comparisons, but felt that the series overcame them with the production of [...] "Rock Show": [...] "I think it was something we had to work through in the beginning, and I’m kind of hoping we’re on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> and people will start to judge the show on its own, for what it is and realize it’s just a completely different world in a similar style." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{the film}} {{seemingly}} continuing plot threads first introduced in Age of Ultron, Mendelson wondered [...] "to {{what extent the}} whole 'Consequences galore!' narrative of Civil War will improve Age of Ultron. As much great stuff as that movie has ... the main hero foolishly/recklessly [...] a world-killing threat to Earth and lots of really bad stuff goes down and yet {{no one seems to}} care at the end ... What does it mean if Civil War does retroactively improve Age of Ultron? Will we be at a point where we really can’t judge a franchise installment on its own merits because a future installment may well fix the flaws a couple years down the line?" [...] McMillan continued some of Mendelson's thinking, feeling that Marvel was [...] "in an awkward place with Civil War" [...] regarding superhero destruction moving forward. He wondered how superhero oversight would [...] "actually prevent the kind of destruction that it's meant to stop ... unless the bad guys all agree to play by the new rules" [...] as well. [...] "Worse still ... the destruction caused by superhero fights [...] foremost in viewers' heads ... the audience won't be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> wall. After Civil War, can Marvel go back to pretending that everyone is okay after any large scale event ever again?" ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2013, filming was {{scheduled}} to take place at Shepperton Studios in London, United Kingdom, and Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in 3D. Victoria Alonso, an executive producer on the film, said that filming would begin in June. She also said that both Rocket Raccoon and Groot would be created {{through a combination of}} CGI and motion capture, going on to say that [...] "You can't do any motion capture with a raccoon – they won't let you put the suit on. But we will do rotomation, probably, for some of the behavior... we definitely will have performers to emulate what James Gunn will lead to be, the behavior and the performance. He's very clear on where he wants to take the characters." [...] In March 2013, Feige discussed Guardians of the Galaxy in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, [...] "It's much more of a standalone film. It takes place in the same universe. And when we've been on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> universe in other movies, you might see those characteristics in Guardians, but the Avengers are not involved with what's happening out there at this time." [...] Feige also stated that 95% of the film would take place in space. In mid-March, Dave Bautista was signed to play Drax the Destroyer. Other actors who had been considered for the role included Isaiah Mustafa, Brian Patrick Wade and Jason Momoa. By the following week, sculptor Brian Muir, who sculpted Darth Vader's mask for the Star Wars films, was revealed to be working on the film.|$|E
500|$|... "Rock Show", {{the first}} season finale of Parks and Recreation was written by Norm Hiscock and {{directed}} by series co-founder Michael Schur. Schur said he felt [...] "Rock Show" [...] marked a change in tone for the series and struck a better balance between personal and professional stories {{than any of the}} other episodes from the season. Schur said: [...] "We treated that whole six-episode season like a pilot. If you go back and watch those episodes now, you can see us making changes. The sixth episode is different in tone than the first. And we made some character tweaks, like every show ever does". Amy Poehler said she believed [...] "Rock Show" [...] would end what she described as the inevitable comparisons between Parks and Recreation and The Office, which is also produced by Parks creators Schur and Greg Daniels. Poehler said, [...] "I think it was something we had to work through in the beginning, and I’m kind of hoping we’re on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> and people will start to judge the show on its own, for what it is and realize it’s just a completely different world in a similar style.” Schur made his directorial debut with [...] "Rock Show", and had only one day of preparation before directing the episode. While preparing to direct the episode, Schur was asked to make an appearance on The Office as Mose Schrute, the cousin of Dwight Schrute and a popular minor character, in the fifth season finale episode, [...] "Company Picnic". Schur regretfully declined because he needed the time to work on [...] "Rock Show", leading Office episode writers Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta to create the character Rolf, Dwight's friend played by James Urbaniak, as an alternative.|$|E

He was seen standing on the field during the Patriots' post-game celebration; he later commented: [...] "I wanted {{to catch up to}} the moment of {{what it feels like to}} be on the other side, to be on this side, the losing side. To let it sink in, to hurt, so when we start practice in the fall, the two-a-days and there are days during the season when I’m tired and I want to go home, but I need to watch that extra film. I want to get back there, but I want to get on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> field. They rope you off, the losing team basically. I just want to get on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> rope. I just wanted to watch and let it sink in and hurt a little bit.

2500|$|Poehler {{said the}} first season {{struggled}} {{in part due to}} extremely high expectations from comparisons to The Office.
