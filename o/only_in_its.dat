5|$|A 2008 paper saw {{a return}} to white-eye {{taxonomy}} with the formal description of the Togian white-eye Zosterops somadikartai, an endemic species of the Togian Islands of Indonesia, which, unlike most of its relatives, lacks the white ring around the eye which give this group of birds its name. Rasmussen noted that the Togian white-eye is distinctive not <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> appearance, but also in its lilting song, which sounds higher pitched and is less varied in frequency than the songs of its close relatives.|$|E
5|$|The opera's appeal lay not <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> {{story about}} a {{crippled}} shepherd boy healed on the first Christmas Eve but in its wedding of opera and the limitations of television. The broad effects of theater were eschewed and instead an intimacy appropriate to the television studio and home viewing was cultivated. The production starred Chet Allen as Amahl and Rosemary Kuhlmann as his mother. Kuhlmann reprised her role annually for many years.|$|E
5|$|Even {{among other}} festive music written by Bach, this work's scoring for four {{trumpets}} is unusual. It is characterised {{by a very}} solemn character and the attributes of courtly homage music, such as the opening chorus {{in the form of}} a French overture or fanfare-like trumpet interjections in the bass recitative. Bach created a work that in musical terms corresponds less to sacred music and more to the type of secular music for a princely court, as had been required of him during his time in office in Köthen. <b>Only</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> final two movements does Bach again use simple forms to emphasize the work's character of a church cantata, implying that earthly powers do not last, but God – the supreme ruler – is entitled to have the last word.|$|E

5|$|The {{first three}} {{chapters}} describe {{the various types}} of coral reef, each chapter starting with a section giving {{a detailed description of the}} reef Darwin had most information about, which he presents as a typical example of the type. Subsequent sections in each chapter then describe other reefs in comparison with the typical example. In the first chapter, Darwin describes atolls and lagoon islands, taking as his typical example his own detailed findings and the Beagle survey findings on the Keeling Islands. The second chapter similarly describes a typical barrier reef then compares it to others, and the third chapter gives a similar description of what Darwin called fringing or shore reefs. Having described the principal kinds of reef in detail, his finding was that the actual surface of the reef did not differ much. An atoll differs from an encircling barrier reef only in lacking the central island, and a barrier reef differs from a fringing reef <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> distance from the land and in enclosing a lagoon.|$|E

This made it the fastest aircraft of the B-10 series. Despite this advantage, only one was built, as a test aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Like the Cycads, {{this unique}} cone-bearing plant is not {{considered}} a conifer, but belongs in the Order Welwitschiales. Welwitschia mirabilis is often called a living fossil and is the <b>only</b> species <b>in</b> <b>its</b> genus, which is the <b>only</b> genus <b>in</b> <b>its</b> family, which is the <b>only</b> family <b>in</b> <b>its</b> Order. The male cones are on male plants, and female cones on female plants. After emergence of the two cotyledons, it sets only two more leaves. Those two leaves then continue to grow longer from their base, much like fingernails. This allows it great drought tolerance, which is likely why it has survived in the desert of Namibia, while all other representatives from its order are now extinct.|$|R

25|$|Parker v. Flook, , was a 1978 United States Supreme Court {{decision}} that ruled that an invention that departs from the prior art <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> {{use of a}} mathematical algorithm is patent-eligible only if the implementation is novel and nonobvious. The algorithm itself must be considered {{as if it were}} part of the prior art. The case was argued on April 25, 1978 and was decided June 22, 1978. This case is the second member of the Supreme Court's patent-eligibility trilogy.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 1963, {{the entire}} campus {{with all of}} its {{facilities}} and faculty became known as the University of Windsor. As a 'federated member', Assumption University remained as an integrated institution, granting degrees <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> Faculty of Theology. Father Eugene Carlisle LeBel from Assumption became the inaugural president of the University of Windsor, and Frank A. DeMarco, who had been holding both positions of Principal, as well as Dean of Applied Science at Essex College, became the inaugural Vice President. The University's coats of arms were designed by Alan Beddoe.|$|E
25|$|Scales: While, as {{mentioned}} under Fingering, a player will usually play a given instrument <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> tonic key and possibly {{in the key}} beginning on the fourth (e.g. G on a D whistle), nearly any key is possible, becoming progressively more difficult to keep in tune as the player {{moves away from the}} whistle's tonic, according to the circle of fifths. Thus a D whistle is fairly apt for playing both G and A, and a C instrument can be used fairly easily for F and G.|$|E

25|$|The {{sequencing}} of individual genomes further unveiled levels of genetic complexity {{that had not}} been appreciated before. Personal genomics helped reveal the significant level of diversity in the human genome attributed not only to SNPs but structural variations as well. However, the application of such knowledge to the treatment of disease and in the medical field is <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> very beginnings. Exome sequencing has become increasingly popular as a tool to aid in diagnosis of genetic disease because the exome contributes only 1% of the genomic sequence but accounts for roughly 85% of mutations that contribute significantly to disease.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to studying an easier {{version of the}} yeshiva curriculum, the mechina also featured secular studies, another innovation at the time. This was cause for opposition {{from the ranks of}} many rabbis, who were unaccustomed to the idea of secular studies occupying a position in any form of yeshiva. In 1924, however, the Lithuanian government announced its decision to accredit only those rabbinical colleges that possessed a secular studies department. The Rabbinical College of Telshe was the only such institute. It is to be stressed, though, that secular studies did not occupy a place in the yeshiva itself, but <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> mechina.|$|E
25|$|The UK {{version of}} the vehicle was {{intended}} {{to fit into the}} Vauxhall range below the Viva, and was initially presented <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> hatchback version, a style that became very popular during the 1970s. With its Pontiac-inspired 'shovel nose' and inset headlamps, the UK version looked radically different from the Opel Kadett and was accepted by the motoring public as a completely new car; when the saloon, estate car and van variants appeared and the hatchback was added to the Kadett lineup the common lineage became apparent. The Chevette was the first British-built hatchback of this size,; Ford did not respond with a similar product until the following year (their similar-sized offerings all having conventional rear boots).|$|E
