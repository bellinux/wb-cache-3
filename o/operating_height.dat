5|$|Hitler {{was finally}} {{convinced}} {{of the need to}} try every possible method to stop Bomber Command's night offensive over Germany. The operation was sanctioned by the OKL in November. Secrecy of the operation was paramount. The problem of preparing a large number of crews produced security fears which was recognised clearly. When crews of NJG 3 and NJG 2 were called to a briefing on Gisela, they were locked behind guarded doors. The crews were told that all available night fighters would participate in an all-out attack against Bomber Command over their airfields in England. The tactical deployment for the operation, they were told, was for two waves of night fighters to cross the coast in the region of Hull. To avoid enemy radar raiders were told to fly at minimum altitude and then climb to 4,500 metres as they reached the coast, generally believed to be the average <b>operating</b> <b>height</b> of British bombers. The Luftwaffe Western Front Intelligence Summary Service prepared dossiers for crews to study. It advised on the layout of British airfields and the lighting systems, such as the Drem system, along with funnel lights and angle of glide indicators. Crews were warned about RAF lighting codes on the control towers which warned RAF bomber crews of a possible intruder in the vicinity.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to find the ergonomically optimal <b>operating</b> surface <b>height</b> for laparoscopic surgery in order to reduce {{discomfort}} in the upper extremities of the operators and the assistants. The <b>operating</b> surface <b>height</b> was defined as the level of the abdominal wall of a patient with pneumoperitoneum. Materials and Methods: Two pelvi-trainer tests were performed. One test was performed on six different <b>operating</b> surface <b>heights.</b> The (extreme) joint excursions of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist were measured by a video analysis method. Another test was performed by holding a laparoscope for 15 minutes while an electromyelograph of the biceps brachii was made. The results of both tests were evaluated subjectively by a questionnaire. Results: The ergonomically optimal <b>operating</b> surface <b>height</b> lies between a factor 0. 7 and 0. 8 of the elbow height of the operator/assistant. At this height, the joint excursions stay in the neutral zone for more than 90 % of the total manipulation time, and the activity of the biceps brachii when holding the laparoscope stays within 15 % of the maximum muscle activity. Conclusions: The <b>operating</b> surface <b>height</b> influences the (extreme) upper joint excursions of the surgeon. The ergonomically optimal <b>operating</b> surface <b>height</b> reduces the discomfort in the shoulders, back, and wrists of the surgeon during laparoscopic surgery. This optimal table height range for laparoscopic surgery is lower than those currently available. Industrial Design Engineerin...|$|R

5000|$|As a result, {{the camera}} doesn't bounce {{up to the}} 'balanced' {{position}} after a move, for example when the operator steps up onto a curb from the road. This allows the camera to be more isolated and independent of the operator's moves. The operator can of course deliberately move the camera up or down, if desired. In reality however camera operators find it preferable for the arm to not be perfectly iso-elastic so that the camera will naturally rise to a comfortable <b>operating</b> <b>height.</b> Though the springs will be tensioned so this only happens very slowly and without {{bouncing up and down}} so as to maintain the smoothness of the camera's motion." ...|$|E

50|$|Gamera I {{consists}} of a X-shaped fuselage frame spanning 60 ft. At the terminus of {{each end of the}} frame resides a 42 ft long rotor. The structure uses combinations of balsa, foam, mylar, and carbon fiber. Composite materials are assembled using filament winding construction for maximum strength to stiffness ratios. The vehicle weighs 101 lb, each rotor weighs 7 lb each, and the powerplant/pilot weighs 107 lb. Power is transferred to the rotors via hand and foot pedals in a pod suspended beneath the structure. The rotor speed required for flight is approximately 18 rpm. An extra 10 percent power is achieved using this more complex method rather than pedal power alone. The rotors operate in extreme ground effect, a distance of less than five percent of the rotor length from its <b>operating</b> <b>height.</b> The cockpit was modified on May 10, due to structure flexing at speed.|$|E

These methods use "theoretical finite element analysis techniques, together with experimental results, to detect stress, deflection and life of spring in different types of springs like helical compression spring, leaf spring.

50|$|In 1971, Paraguay and Argentina {{created the}} River Parana Joint Commission (Comisión Mixta del Río Paraná, COMIP), which started {{to carry out}} {{different}} studies (pre-feasibility, environmental, etc.) for the Corpus project, to be located upstream of the Paraná river, close to the towns of Corpus (in the Argentina Misiones Province and Puerto Bella Vista in Paraguay. In the mid-1980s, Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil signed a tripartite agreement that established the <b>operating</b> <b>height</b> of the project, which would allow {{to bring into line}} the operation of Corpus with those of Yacyreta and Itaipu. The different alternatives for this project are still under study. As a large hydroelectric project, with installed capacity of about 3,000 MW and annual generation of about 19,000 GWh, Corpus is a controversial project that is opposed both at the regional and social levels. In April 1996, in a plebiscite in the Misiones Province, the construction of the dam was opposed by almost 89% of the voters.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{terminus}} of {{each end}} of the frame resides a rotor. Each rotor weighs 2 kg, and the powerplant/pilot weighs 135 lb to 145 lb. Power is transferred to the rotors via hand and foot pedals in a pod suspended beneath the structure. Up to 20 percent additional power for the 60 second runtime is achieved using this more complex method rather than pedal power alone. Like a pull-starter on a lawn mower, the transmission spools in a length of Spectra line in order to spin the rotors. There is enough line to spool the rotors 90 seconds. The line needs to be rewound for each effort, but weighs significantly less than a continuous chain or belt drive. The rotors operate in extreme ground effect, a distance of less than five percent of the rotor length from its <b>operating</b> <b>height.</b> Ideal operation is at 90 rpm for the [...] "engine" [...] and 20 rpm for the rotors.|$|E

50|$|The {{nature of}} the air war had changed {{significantly}} since 1941 and German bomber crews implemented new tactics. In the Blitz, German bombers were dispatched individually rather than in formation. Each Gruppe had been briefed to take off and bomb the target {{over a period of}} time extending anywhere up to ten hours. The intention was to place the British Civil Defence Authority and anti-aircraft artillery defences under maximum strain and also inflict greater psychological damage to the civilian population. This kind of tactic was effective in 1940 when German crews understood they faced little threat from RAF Fighter Command night fighters. The tactics were also designed to limit the chances of collision. Bombers took off at an interval of four minutes with an average spacing of 12 miles. Even with airborne radar-equipped night fighters it usually meant there was only one raider every 180 square miles. The average <b>operating</b> <b>heights</b> of 10 to 20,000 ft put one raider in every 345 cubic miles of air space.|$|R
