5|$|After a {{short period}} of demobilization, the major naval nations of the globe began {{programmes}} for increasing the size and number of their capital ships. Wilson's plan for a world-leading set <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> ships led to a Japanese counter-programme, and a plan by the British to build sufficient ships to maintain a navy superior to either. American isolationist feeling and the economic concerns of the others led to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921. The outcome of the conference included the Washington Naval Treaty (also known as the Five-Power treaty), and limitations on the use of submarines. The Treaty prescribed a ratio of 5:5:3:1:1 for capital ships between treaty nations. The treaty recognized the U.S. Navy as being equal to the Royal Navy with 525,000 tons <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> ships and 135,000 tons of aircraft carriers, and the Japanese as the third power. Many older ships were scrapped by the five nations to meet the treaty limitations, and new building <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> ships limited.|$|E

40|$|Working {{capital is}} {{the lifeblood of}} the {{business}} organization. Merely having the {{investment in fixed assets}} does not determine the success of a business organization, {{it is also important to}} have efficient management <b>of</b> working <b>capital.</b> The objective <b>of</b> working <b>capital</b> management is to maintain a satisfactory level <b>of</b> working <b>capital</b> through the management of current assets and current liabilities. If a satisfactory level <b>of</b> working <b>capital</b> is not maintained the organization is likely to become insolvent and may even be forced to bankruptcy. Therefore, for the smooth running of the business efficient management <b>of</b> working <b>capital</b> is required.

5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E

5|$|Canada's {{approach}} to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, {{which is based}} on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support. Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, and the legalization of same-sex marriage are further social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. Canadians also identify with the country's health care institutions, peacekeeping, the National park system and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E
5|$|Execution by {{elephant}} was {{a common}} method <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> punishment in South and Southeast Asia, particularly in India, where Asian elephants were used to crush, dismember, or torture captives in public executions.

5|$|Following {{the fall}} of the authoritarian {{government}} in Portugal in 1974, the Spanish government was the sole surviving dictatorship in Western Europe, where several countries in 1975 were ruled by socialist parties which had long loathed Franco for coming to power by overthrowing a socialist democracy. Hostility to the use <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> punishment was widespread in Western Europe at this time and most Western European countries had ceased using it.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the {{economist}} Harry Saunders dubbed {{the hypothesis that}} improvements in energy efficiency work to increase (rather than decrease) energy consumption the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate, and argued that the hypothesis is broadly supported by neoclassical growth theory (the mainstream economic theory <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> accumulation, technological progress and long-run economic growth).
