5|$|Chapman and Douglas Adams wrote a {{pilot for}} a TV series in 1975, <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trees,</b> but it {{received}} poor ratings after being broadcast {{at the same}} time as Match of the Day and only the initial episode was produced. In 1978, Chapman co-wrote the comedy film The Odd Job with McKenna, and starred as one of the main characters. Chapman wanted his friend Keith Moon to play a co-lead role alongside him, but Moon could not pass an acting test, so the part went to David Jason who had previously appeared on Do Not Adjust Your Set with Pythons Idle, Jones, and Palin. The film was moderately successful.|$|E

At Monmouth, Colonel Harry Trelawny led the 502-man 1st Guards Battalion while Lieutenant Colonel James Ogilvie {{commanded}} the 480-strong 2nd Guards Battalion. Trelawny was wounded and about 40 casualties were inflicted {{when some of}} Anthony Wayne's troops under Lieutenant Colonels Walter Stewart and Nathaniel Ramsey fired on the Guards while concealed in a wood. Joined by the 1st Grenadier Battalion, the Guards quickly flushed the Americans <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As the Roman baggage train {{came into}} view, the Belgic force {{suddenly}} rushed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and surprised their opponents, overwhelming the Roman cavalry. They crossed the shallow river {{at full speed}} and charged up the hill against the legions setting up camp, giving them no time to get into battle formation. [...] It seemed to Caesar that the Nervii came on with incredible speed, all at once pouring <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> charging across the river and overrunning his legionaries.|$|E

2500|$|The toughest {{fighting}} {{of the day}} {{occurred in}} Clausel's sector. John Colborne's brigade of Charles Alten's Light Division attacked La Bayonette at [...] The French charged downhill and drove back the green-jacketed skirmishers of the 95th Rifles Foot. Suddenly the 1/52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) appeared <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and quickly turned the tables. Following closely behind the retreating French, the redcoats of the 52nd overran the redoubt with surprising ease.|$|E

2500|$|Everett {{recalled}} {{also the}} Johns' woods [...] "with wild cherry trees in blossom, and ... a model with flying red hair, clad in white, being chased in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> by nude children". With similar lack of inhibition, {{as early as}} 1907 the American heiress Natalie Barney (1875–1972) was leading like-minded women in sapphic dances in her Parisian garden, photographs of which look little different from scenes at Woodstock in 1969 and other [...] "pop" [...] festivals of the late 1960s and early 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|Adams had two brief {{appearances}} in the fourth series of Monty Python's Flying Circus. At the beginning of episode 42, [...] "The Light Entertainment War", Adams is in a surgeon's mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while Michael Palin narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another but never gets started. At the beginning of episode 44, [...] "Mr. Neutron", Adams {{is dressed in a}} pepper-pot outfit and loads a missile onto a cart driven by Terry Jones, who is calling for scrap metal ("Any old iron..."). The two episodes were broadcast in November 1974. Adams and Chapman also attempted non-Python projects, including <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trees.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On July 6, 2006, the IDF's Golani Brigade {{under the}} command of Colonel Tamir Yadai, backed by IAF jets and {{artillery}} fire, reoccupied the site of three former Israeli settlements of Dugit, Nisanit and Elei Sinai in the northern Gaza Strip. Additional forces entered the nearby Palestinian town of Beit Lahiya. A Beit Lahiya resident was quoted in Ynetnews.com as saying, [...] "It's a crazy scene – everyone is shooting at everyone," [...] and [...] "Soldiers are coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> from the rooftops. The residents don't know if they should leave their homes or hide." [...] Israeli tanks and helicopter gunships entered Beit Lahiya firing at militant positions.

2500|$|While Lee herself downplayed autobiographical {{parallels}} in the book, Truman Capote, {{mentioning the}} character Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird, described details he considered autobiographical: [...] "In my original version of Other Voices, Other Rooms I had that same man {{living in the}} house that used to leave things in the trees, and then I took that out. He was a real man, and he lived just down the road from us. We used to go and get those things <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> Everything she wrote about it is absolutely true. But you see, I take the same thing and transfer it into some Gothic dream, done in an entirely different way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pizarras once hunted tarsiers for a living. Since age 12, he {{gunned down}} or trapped tarsiers, exotic birds, monkeys, snakes and lizards for his father, a {{taxidermist}} who augmented the family income through {{the sale of}} the preserved kill. [...] Pizarras himself caught and sold Philippine tarsier specimens to collectors, hobbyists and tourists for a living[...] [...] He became so adept at the task that he hunted tarsiers by scent, learning that the animals gave off a musk through glands located on their breasts. Then, he shot them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> with air rifles, easily catching about 100 a month. At that time, stuffed tarsiers went for 300 pesos (about five dollars). For those who preferred live pets, catching them alive was a relatively straightforward undertaking. Trees were simply shaken until the tarsiers fell.|$|E
2500|$|Douglas Adams was [...] "discovered" [...] by Chapman when {{a version}} of Footlights Revue (a 1974 BBC2 {{television}} show featuring some of Adams' early work) was performed live in London's West End. In Cleese's absence from the final TV series, the two formed a brief writing partnership, with Adams earning a writing credit in one episode for a sketch called [...] "Patient Abuse". In the sketch, {{a man who had}} been stabbed by a nurse arrives at his doctor's office bleeding profusely from the stomach, when the doctor makes him fill in numerous senseless forms before he can administer treatment. He also had two cameo appearances in this season. Firstly, in the episode [...] "The Light Entertainment War", Adams shows up in a surgeon's mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to the on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while Palin narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another, and never actually gets started. Secondly, at the beginning of [...] "Mr. Neutron", Adams is dressed in a [...] "pepperpot" [...] outfit and loads a missile onto a cart being driven by Terry Jones, who is calling out for scrap metal ("Any old iron..."). Adams and Chapman also subsequently attempted a few non-Python projects, including <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trees.</b> He also contributed to a sketch on the soundtrack album for Monty Python and the Holy Grail.|$|E

2500|$|Six {{million years}} ago {{at the close of the}} Miocene era, the earth's climate was {{gradually}} cooling and this would lead to the glaciations of the Pliocene and the Pleistocene (the Ice Age). In many areas the forests and savannahs were being replaced with steppe or grasslands and only those creatures that could adapt would survive. On opposite sides of the planet, two very different lineages would adapt to these changes and their evolution would produce two species that would become the most widely distributed of mammals. In southern North America, small woodland foxes were growing bigger and becoming more adapted to running, and by the late Miocene the first of the genus Canis had arisen, the ancestors of coyotes, wolves and the domestic dog. In eastern Africa, a split was occurring among the large primates. Some would remain in the trees, while others would move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> learn to walk upright, develop enlarged brains, and learn to avoid predators while becoming a predator themselves in the more open country. The two lineages would ultimately meet on the Eurasian continent. [...] "They were individual animals and people involved, from our perspective, in a biological and cultural process that involved linking not only their lives but the evolutionary fate of their heirs in ways, we must assume, they could never have imagined." ...|$|E
