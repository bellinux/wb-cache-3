5|$|Complex {{powers and}} {{logarithms}} are more naturally handled as single valued functions on a Riemann surface. Single valued versions {{are defined by}} choosing a sheet. The value has a discontinuity along a branch cut. Choosing one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> solutions as the principal value leaves us with functions that are not continuous, and the usual rules for manipulating powers can lead us astray.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, lead's {{toxicity}} was recognized, {{and its use}} has since been phased <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> applications. Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones, damages the nervous system, and causes blood disorders. It is particularly problematic in children: even if blood levels are promptly normalized with treatment, permanent brain damage may result.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses {{are popular}} birds for birdwatchers and their colonies are popular {{destinations}} for ecotourists. Regular birdwatching trips are taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> coastal towns and cities, like Monterey, Dunedin, Kaikoura, Wollongong, Sydney, Port Fairy, Hobart and Cape Town, to see pelagic seabirds. Albatrosses are easily attracted to these sightseeing boats by {{the deployment of}} fish oil and burley into the sea. Visits to colonies can be very popular: the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in Dunedin, New Zealand, attracts 40,000 visitors a year, and more isolated colonies are regular attractions on cruises to subantarctic islands.|$|E

5|$|Helicoverpa zea earns its {{nickname}} {{the corn}} earworm for its widely known destruction of cornfields. The corn earworm feeds on {{every part of}} corn, including the kernels. Severe feeding {{at the tip of}} kernels allows entry for diseases and mold growth. Larvae begin feeding on the kernels once they have reached third instar. Larvae penetrate 9 to 15cm into the ear, with deeper penetration occurring as the kernels harden. Larvae do not eat the hard kernels, but take bites <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> kernels, lowering the quality of the corn for processing.|$|E
5|$|Most tern {{species are}} declining in numbers {{due to the}} loss or {{disturbance}} of breeding habitat, pollution and increased predation. Gull populations have increased {{over the last century}} because of reduced persecution and the availability of food from human activities, and terns have been forced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> traditional nesting areas by the larger birds. A few species are defying the trend and showing local increases, including the Arctic tern in Scandinavia, Forster's tern around the Great Lakes, the Sandwich tern in eastern North America and its yellow-billed subspecies, the Cayenne tern, in the Caribbean.|$|E

25|$|The {{last part}} of the name herred derives from a medieval {{practice}} of dividing the country in districts herreder which created the frame for regional justice and possibly also for recruitment of soldiers to the national army and fleet.

After the administrative importance of the herreder ended in 1919, the once common name began to disappear all over the country.
