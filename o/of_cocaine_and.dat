40|$|The study investigates {{patterns}} <b>of</b> <b>cocaine</b> powder <b>and</b> crack <b>cocaine</b> use {{in different}} groups in nine European cities. A multi-centre cross-sectional {{study was conducted}} in Barcelona, Budapest, Dublin, Hamburg, London, Paris, Rome, Vienna, and Zurich. Data were collected by structured face-to-face interviews. The sample comprises 1, 855 <b>cocaine</b> users out <b>of</b> three subgroups: 632 cocaine users in addiction treatment, mainly maintenance treatment; 615 socially marginalised cocaine users not in treatment; and 608 socially integrated cocaine users not in treatment. Measurements: Use <b>of</b> <b>cocaine</b> powder, crack <b>cocaine</b> <b>and</b> other substances in the last 30 days, routes of administration, <b>and</b> lifetime use <b>of</b> <b>cocaine</b> powder <b>and</b> crack <b>cocaine.</b> The marginalised group showed the highest intensity <b>of</b> <b>cocaine</b> use, <b>of</b> heroin use and of multiple substance use. Of the integrated group, 95 per cent snorted cocaine powder, while in the two other groups, injecting was quite prevalent, but with huge differences between the cities. Ninety-six per cent of all participants had used at least one other substance in addition to cocaine in the last 30 days. The use <b>of</b> <b>cocaine</b> powder <b>and</b> crack <b>cocaine</b> varies widely between different groups and between cities. Nonetheless, multiple substance use is the predominating pattern <b>of</b> <b>cocaine</b> use, <b>and</b> the different routes of administration have to be taken into account...|$|R
5|$|Starting in 1990, Rosecroft Raceway {{hosted the}} Messenger Stakes, {{one of the}} races for the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers. Rosecroft {{attracted}} the Potomac Stakes, Maryland's most successful race, starting in that year. The Potomac Stakes was previously held at Freestate Raceway and generated one-million-dollar-plus handles on several occasions. On a September 1990 night, $1,195,681 was wagered by bettors, becoming the then-largest handle in Rosecroft's history. This record was broken on May 3, 2003 when $1,564,150 was wagered. Vogel was arrested in September 1990 for possession <b>of</b> <b>cocaine,</b> <b>and</b> his company filed for bankruptcy protection.|$|E
5|$|Ramírez Treviño was {{an active}} {{participant}} and coordinator <b>of</b> <b>cocaine</b> <b>and</b> marijuana shipments heading to the United States from Mexico. He is also involved in moving {{large sums of money}} from drug sales heading back to Mexico from the U.S. through the Reynosa corridor. He was also the leader of Los Metros, a Gulf Cartel subgroup. In 2008, he was charged with a federal indictment in the District of Columbia for violations of Title 21 USC Sections 959, 960, 963, and Title 18 USC Section 2. The United States Department of State was offering up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction. Mexico, however, did not have him on its most-wanted list and was not offering any financial reward for information leading to his arrest.|$|E
5|$|Rosecroft {{was sold}} to Mark Vogel in 1987. Vogel made several {{mistakes}} that hurt the horse racing industry in Maryland. Three years later, {{he was arrested for}} possession <b>of</b> <b>cocaine,</b> <b>and</b> his company went into bankruptcy. Rosecroft {{was sold to}} Weisman's Colt Enterprises in 1991. In that same year, the grandstand caught fire and was reconstructed in 1993 for $3.6 million. In 1995, after losing millions, the relatives of Weisman sold Rosecroft to Cloverleaf Enterprises. In the 2000s, Cloverleaf attempted to sell Rosecroft multiple times, but due to lawsuits and politics, all the potential buyers became uninterested. Nearby states legalized casinos to help their racetracks. Money generated from the casinos was used to increase the purses and handle (daily betting turnover), and Rosecroft was unable to produce the same amount of money. After filing for bankruptcy once again, Rosecroft Raceway closed down in 2010. The next year, Penn National Gaming purchased the racetrack with the hope to make it a racino, and Rosecroft reopened in 2011.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Osiel {{was arrested}} in Matamoros {{following}} a shootout with the Mexican military, and was extradited to the United States in 2007. In exchange for a life sentence, Osiel cooperated with the U.S. authorities by supplying information on {{the workings of the}} Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas. When Osiel was arrested, Antonio Ezequiel inherited the Gulf Cartel along with Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, a former policeman in Matamoros. He and other Gulf Cartel leaders were responsible for trafficking multi-ton drug shipments <b>of</b> <b>cocaine</b> <b>and</b> marijuana from Mexico to the United States. Antonio Ezequiel received a federal indictment in 2008 in the District of Columbia for drug trafficking violations. He also directed the flow of narcotics through land, sea, and air from Venezuela and Colombia to Guatemala and the U.S-Mexico border. When Osiel was imprisoned, several high-ranking lieutenants in the Gulf Cartel got together to appoint leaders and their turfs. According to the declarations of Zeta leader Mateo Díaz López (alias Comandante Mateo), Antonio Ezequiel was given the turf of Matamoros, one of the leading smuggling routes for the cartel. But Antonio Ezequiel never had the edge; one of his most trusted men, Ramiro García Hernández (alias El Mati), {{was arrested in}} 2004. Deemed inexperienced, Costilla Sánchez, Lazcano, and high-ranking leader Víctor Manuel Vázquez Mireles (alias El Meme Loco) moved Antonio Ezequiel to command the Gulf Cartel in Cancún. But after failing to meet the Gulf Cartel's demands, he was replaced.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, Mesa resigned, {{citing the}} {{pressure}} of Morales and the cocalero road blocks and riots. Amid fears of civil war, Eduardo Rodríguez became President of a transitional government, preparing Bolivia for a general election in December 2005. Hiring the Peruvian Walter Chávez as its campaign manager, the MAS electoral campaign was based on Salvador Allende's successful campaign in the Chilean presidential election, 1970. Measures were implemented to institutionalize the party structure, giving it greater independence from the social movement; this was done to allow Morales and other MAS leaders to respond quickly to new developments without the lengthy process of consulting the bases, and to present a more moderate image away from the bases' radicalism. Although he had initially hoped for a female running mate, Morales eventually chose Marxist intellectual Álvaro García Linera as his Vice Presidential candidate, with some Bolivian press speculating as to a romantic relationship between the two. MAS' primary opponent was Jorge Quiroga and his center-right Social and Democratic Power, whose campaign was centered in Santa Cruz and which advocated continued neo-liberal reform; Quiroga accused Morales of promoting the legalization <b>of</b> <b>cocaine</b> <b>and</b> being a puppet for Venezuela.|$|E
