5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1967, Favaloro began {{to consider the possibility}} of using the saphenous vein in coronary surgery. He put his ideas into practice {{for the first time in}} May of that year. The basic principle was to bypass a diseased (obstructed) segment in a coronary artery in order to deliver blood flow distally. The standardization of this technique, called bypass or transmyocardial revascularization surgery, was the fundamental work of his career, and ensured that his prestige would transcend the limits of his country, as the procedure radically changed the treatment <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> disease. In 1970 he published one of his best-known volumes, Surgical Treatment <b>of</b> <b>Coronary</b> Arteriosclerosis.|$|E

5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH is the development <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population.

Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of}} the body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E

5|$|March 2009 {{recommendations}} from the USPSTF {{on the use}} of aspirin for the primary prevention <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

Low-dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Hemodynamically {{significant}} primary anomalies <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> arteries {{are those}} which alter myocardial perfusion. There are four major types: coronary artery fistulae, origin <b>of</b> the left <b>coronary</b> artery from the pulmonary artery, congenital coronary stenosis or atresia, and origin <b>of</b> the left <b>coronary</b> artery {{from the right}} sinus of Valsalva, with subse-quent passage of the vessel between the aorta and right ventricular infundibulum. Tbc- angiographic features of these lesions are discussed. PRIMARY CONGENITAL ANOMALIES <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> arteries (that is, those which can occur as isolated anomalies and are not necessarily associated {{with other types of}} congenital heart disease) can be divided into hemodynamically significant and in-significant lesions.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comBackground: High resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> artery wall in vivo has been limited by the cardiac and respiratory motion, flow artifacts {{as well as the}} relatively small size <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> arteries. We sought to validate in vivo black blood MR imaging <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> artery wall using a double inversion recovery fast spin echo MR imaging sequence with limited breath-holding and cardiac gating for suppression of motion artifacts by comparison with ex vivo MR imaging. Methods: Yorkshire albino swine (n = 6) were used in this study and coronary lesions were induced with balloon angioplasty. Four weeks after balloon injury <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> arteries MR imaging <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> artery lesions was performed. High resolution in vivo and ex vivo images <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> artery wall and lesions were obtained using a double inversion recovery fast spin echo sequence in a 1. 5 T MR system. There was a statistically significant agreement (p < 0. 0001) between measurements of vessel wall area (r = 0. 87, slope = 0. 87) and maximal wall thickness (r = 0. 84, slope = 0. 88) from in vivo and ex vivo MR images <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> arteries. The mean differences between in vivo and ex vivo measurements were 0. 56 ± 1. 98 mm 2 for vessel wall area and 0. 02 ± 0. 36 mm for maximal wall thickness.
