40|$|Background Out of the {{different}} <b>fund</b> categories <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> have had the highest development in Sweden since 1994. Swedish investors’ interest in <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> doubled from 2005 to 2006. <b>Hedge</b> <b>funds</b> {{are said to be}} an investment with a low risk and not being dependent upon business cycle movements. Historically there have been high initial investments, most often over 100 000 SEK, required to invest in <b>hedge</b> <b>funds.</b> This has started to shift towards lower initial investments. This is a reason why <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> start to become interesting to private investors and not only to institutional, and wealthy private investors. Purpose The purpose of this thesis is to explore what different investment strategies and sub strategies that are used within Swedish <b>hedge</b> <b>funds.</b> Also specific risks and risk measurements, depending on investment strategy, will be investigated and compared. Method In order to meet the purpose of this thesis a qualitative approach has been used. A questionnaire, with both closed and open-end questions, was sent to 13 <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> managers operating in the Swedish <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> market. Afterwards, four semi-structured interviews were conducted. Two of the interviewees are <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> managers who also answered the questionnaire. The others were with a person who is a <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> analyst and a person working at the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (SFSA). Conclusion Out of the five different investment strategies investigated the two most widely used in Swedish <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> are <b>funds</b> of <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> and equity <b>hedge.</b> The sub strategies that are used within the Swedish <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> market are those with a focus on low risk. Within Swedish <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> there are some specific risks and risk measurements that are useful. Sharpe ratio is best used to compare similar funds. Standard deviation is useful to evaluate each specific <b>hedge</b> <b>fund.</b> How much leverage capital that can be used is decided by SFSA. Yet, the risks depend on the <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> manager rather than the investment strategy used. This, {{due to the fact that}} the <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> managers have an own interest in the <b>hedge</b> <b>fund...</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> {{industry}} {{has grown to}} be one of the most important segments of the financial services industry. <b>Hedge</b> <b>funds</b> are known for employing highly dynamic trading strategies and investing in illiquid assets to increase their profitability. In this thesis, we develop and test the models that capture the time-varying nature of liquidity and profitability of <b>hedge</b> <b>funds.</b> The thesis begins with the study of the liquidity of hedge funds' investments. We propose a method for determining the factors that affect the (unobservable) liquidity of <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> investments. We find substantial evidence of time variation in the liquidity of <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> returns, and that this time variation can be predicted with readily available data. We then examine the impact of market dispersion on the profitability of <b>hedge</b> <b>funds.</b> Market dispersion is measured by cross-sectional volatility, that is, the standard deviation across all asset returns in one time period. We exploit the information held in the cross-sectional dispersion of equity returns and find that market dispersion and the performance of <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> are positively related across all equity-oriented <b>hedge</b> <b>funds.</b> Furthermore, to gain a better understanding of <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> risk, in the third chapter we assess the empirical success of Fung-Hsieh, Fama-French and Statistical Factor Models for explaining <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> returns and compare their explanatory power for the cross section of <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> returns. In the final chapter, we introduce a general and flexible framework for <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> performance evaluation and asset allocation: stochastic dominance theory. Our approach utilizes statistical tests for stochastic dominance to evaluate the performance of <b>hedge</b> <b>funds.</b> To illustrate the method's ability to work with non-normal distributions, we form <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> portfolios by using stochastic dominance criteria and examine the out-of-sample performance of these <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> portfolios. Compared to performance of portfolios of randomly selected <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> and mean-variance efficient <b>hedge</b> <b>funds,</b> our results show that fund selection method based on stochastic dominance criteria greatly improves the performance of <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> portfolios...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} studying how investment banks affect <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> equity investments through acting as prime brokers for <b>hedge</b> <b>funds.</b> The first chapter studies how {{the relationships between}} <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> and investment banks are maintained through equity issuance and prime brokerage business. Using a comprehensive dataset of <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> and IPO allocations, I examine IPO allocation decisions by investment banks to <b>hedge</b> <b>funds.</b> I find that investment banks whose prime brokers have strong relationships with <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> and are lead underwriters of IPOs tend to allocate more IPOs to these <b>hedge</b> <b>funds.</b> Moreover, the allocation to <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> is larger when IPOs are underpriced, and the allocations are larger during bearish periods compared to bullish periods. I further document that <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> investments in IPOs {{are determined by the}} strength of hedge fund-prime broker relationships, rather than by <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> manager skills. I also find that <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> which have multiple prime brokers tend to invest in more IPOs. As a result, prime brokers implicitly support <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> through favorable IPO allocations. The second chapter finds that <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> can profit from anticipating upcoming changes in analysts 2 ̆ 7 recommendations before they become public. I provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> that have prime brokerage affiliations with analysts 2 ̆ 7 investment banks have access to information on upcoming analysts 2 ̆ 7 recommendations. Focusing on recommendations issued up to two days following stock holding report date, I find that large <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> that are clients of the investment bank (affiliated <b>hedge</b> <b>funds)</b> tend to buy upgrades and sell downgrades in a larger magnitude compared to other <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> before the public release of recommendations. Moreover, relative to non-affiliated <b>hedge</b> <b>funds,</b> affiliated <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> have a higher probability to trade {{in a way that is}} consistent with upcoming recommendation changes and earn higher (or avoid lower) short-term abnormal returns by buying (or selling) before upgrades (or downgrades). The results indicate that prime brokerage affiliation is an important source of private information on analysts 2 ̆ 7 reports for <b>hedge</b> <b>funds.</b> The third chapter studies <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> 2 ̆ 7 equity investment strategies by examining the investment value and risk consequence of their holdings concentration in large-cap and small-cap stocks. We find that stocks, especially small-cap ones, with concentrated <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> holdings earn higher future returns than those with less concentrated holdings. We also find that stocks with concentrated <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> holdings have higher downside risks, and the holdings concentration expedites the drop of stock performance, especially during financial crisis. In addition, small-cap stocks with higher holdings concentration are associated with <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> using higher leverage, consistent with Stein (2009) that deleverage leads to the negative return shock and downside risks in stocks.

40|$|A recent Norwegian {{legislative}} proposal, {{likely to}} become law in 2014, suggests that <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> {{should be able to}} approach non-professional, private investors. In light of this, the objective of our thesis is to examine if <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> are an attractive investment opportunity for a Norwegian private investor. By defining two sub-questions, we use empirical research and relevant academic literature to study several aspects of <b>hedge</b> <b>funds.</b> Based on the Sharpe ratio and the Modified Sharpe ratio, we find support for <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> providing an attractive risk/reward relationship. However, these performance evaluations are insufficient due to the illiquidity of <b>hedge</b> <b>funds,</b> the leverage risks, and the returns biases. As the efficient frontiers of stocks and bonds improve when <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> are included, one can argue that <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> provide unique returns. However, the non-normality, skewness, and kurtosis may distort the efficient frontiers. In addition, the calculated correlations between <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> and traditional assets, as well as the similarities between the payoff structure of <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> and short put options, indicate that <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> are not providing unique exposure. In total, our recommendation for Norwegian private investors is to be cautious with regards to investing in <b>hedge</b> <b>funds.</b> This {{is due to the fact}} that the performance of <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> may be distorted, the risk management features may be lower than expected, and <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> will likely be an expensive way of obtaining an unattractive payoff structure. nhhma...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hedge</b> <b>fund</b> {{managers}} {{differ in}} ability and investors want to distinguish good ones from bad. Via {{the design of}} their investment strategies, better fund managers want to ease this inference problem while worse fund managers want to complicate it. We impose only the minimal restrictions on the nature the investment strategies that, on average, returns reflect the <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> manager's ability and that returns be bounded from below, and solve for the set of equilibria that emerge. We then show that {{under a variety of}} equilibrium refinements, a unique equilibrium obtains. In this equilibrium, investors set a cutoff standard for providing capital to a hedge fund: and invest if and only if returns exceed this cutoff. This induces less able <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> managers to adopt risky investment strategies that maximize the probability of meeting this cutoff by risking large losses if they fail. Over time, as investors learn about a <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> manager's ability and less able <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> managers are stochastically weeded out, investors set less demanding re-investment standards.

For example, in a regression with fixed <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> manager effects, returns of more experienced <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> managers decline, even though the expected profits of investors rise with the <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> manager's experience; more experienced <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> deliver less volatile returns; persistence of returns is greater for better <b>hedge</b> funds; <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> failure rates are initially very high, but fall sharply with <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> manager experience; returns of exiting <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> are substantially worse than historical returns; and the longer is an investor's horizon, the lower is the expected return of the <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> in which he invests...|$|R
40|$|A lack of {{commonly}} accepted benchmarks for <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> {{performance has}} permitted <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> managers to attribute to skill returns that may actually accrue from market {{risk factors and}} illiquidity. Recent innovations in <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> replication permits us to estimate the extent of this misattribution. Using an option-based model, we find evidence {{that the value of}} liquidity options that investors implicitly grant managers when they invest may account for part or even all <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> returns. Coupled with the competition from <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> replication vehicles, this finding may motivate <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> investors to demand less restrictive investment terms in the future. ...|$|R
40|$|Employing a new dataset of over 9, 000 {{expressed}} {{demands for}} over 700 <b>hedge</b> <b>funds</b> from a secondary market for <b>hedge</b> <b>funds,</b> this paper finds {{evidence suggesting that}} <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> investors rationally anticipate future <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> performance. Both buy and sell indications of interest arrive following periods of fund outperformance. Buy (sell) indications have some forecasting power for increases (decreases) in <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> performance, over and above other well-known forecasting variables. This information in investor demand co-exists {{with the presence of}} capacity constraints in <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> returns, confirming two main assumptions of Berk and Green (2004). capacity constraints; flows; hedge funds; information...|$|R
