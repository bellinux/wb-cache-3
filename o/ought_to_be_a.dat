5|$|One final {{suggestion}} for political policy reform {{is the notion}} that there <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> political balance in every branch of public service. Lack of balance in public institutions creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the legal standing of confessions as evidence, to remove the incentive for extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E

25|$|In 1919, {{the borough}} {{proposed}} to expand further and annex the neighbouring borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme and the Wolstanton United Urban District, {{both to the}} west of Stoke. This never took place, due to strong objections from Newcastle Corporation. A further attempt was made in 1930, with the promotion of the Stoke-on-Trent Extension Bill. Ultimately, Wolstanton was instead added to Newcastle-under-Lyme in 1932. Although attempts to take Newcastle, Wolstanton and Kidsgrove (north of Tunstall) were never successful, the borough did expand in 1922, taking in Smallthorne Urban District and parts of other parishes from Stoke upon Trent Rural District. The borough was officially granted city status in 1925, with a Lord Mayor from 1928. When the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent initially applied for city status in 1925, citing its importance as the centre of the pottery industry, it was refused by the Home Office as it had fewer than 300,000 inhabitants. The decision was overturned, however, when a direct approach was made to King George V, who agreed that the borough <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> city. The public announcement of the elevation to city status was made by the King during a visit to Stoke on 4 June 1925.|$|E

It is composed in the key of G major, and contains a metronome of 128 beats per minute. Musically, it carries out a chord progression of D–Em–Bm–C, while the group members' vocal ranges go from the notes of G3 to E5.

George Walker wrote in 1846 that, [...] "The first move is an advantage, ... but if properly answered, the first move is of little worth". Steinitz, the first World Champion, who is widely considered the father of modern chess, wrote in 1889, [...] "It is now conceded by all experts that by proper play on both sides the legitimate issue of a game <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> draw." [...] Lasker and Capablanca, {{the second and third}} World Champions, agreed. Reuben Fine, one of the world's leading players from 1936 to 1951, wrote that White's opening advantage is too intangible to be sufficient for a win without an error by Black.|$|E
500|$|In the 19thcentury, {{works by}} major European composers were often used, but when SirFrederick Bridge was {{appointed}} director of {{music for the}} 1902 coronation of King EdwardVII, he decided that it <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> celebration of four hundred years of British music. Compositions by Thomas Tallis, Orlando Gibbons and Henry Purcell were included alongside works by contemporary composers such as Arthur Sullivan, Charles Villiers Stanford and John Stainer. Hubert Parry's I was glad was written as the entrance anthem for the 1902 coronation, replacing an 1831 setting by Thomas Attwood; it contains a bridge section partway through so that the scholars of Westminster School can exercise their right {{to be the first}} commoners to acclaim the sovereign, shouting their traditional [...] "vivats" [...] as he or she enters the coronation theatre. This anthem and Charles Villiers Stanford's Gloria in excelsis (1911) have also been used regularly in recent coronations, as has the national anthem, God Save the Queen (or King). Other composers whose music featured in ElizabethII's coronation include SirGeorge Dyson, Gordon Jacob, SirWilliam Henry Harris, Herbert Howells, SirWilliam Walton, Samuel Sebastian Wesley, Ralph Vaughan Williams and the Canadian-resident but English-born Healey Willan. Ralph Vaughan Williams suggested that a congregational hymn be included. This was approved by the Queen and the Archbishop of Canterbury, so Vaughan Williams recast his 1928 arrangement of Old 100th, the English metrical version of Psalm 100, the Jubilate Deo ("All people that on earth do dwell") for congregation, organ and orchestra: the setting has become ubiquitous at festal occasions in the Anglophone world.|$|E
