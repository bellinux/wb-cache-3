5|$|During the luncheon, Senator Ted Kennedy {{collapsed}} {{after suffering}} a seizure, and he was transported to a hospital for medical treatment. Early reports about the medical emergency suggested erroneously that Senator Robert Byrd, the oldest member of the Senate, also fell ill during the luncheon. These reports were later denied, and Byrd, a longtime friend <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> eventually explained that the Kennedy incident disturbed him and caused him to leave.|$|E
5|$|During the {{presidency}} of Richard Nixon, a US government investigation was initiated into American involvement in the assassinations. Nixon was a political foe <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> having narrowly lost {{to him in the}} 1960 Presidential election. Nixon ordered an investigation under E. Howard Hunt into the murders, convinced Kennedy must have secretly ordered the killings but the inquiry was unable to find any such secret order.|$|E
5|$|The Madison Square Garden {{audience}} {{reacted with}} wild applause and demonstrations {{for half an}} hour. On the final night, Kennedy arrived late after Carter's acceptance speech and while he shook Carter's hand, he failed to raise Carter's arm in the traditional show of party unity. Carter's difficulty in securing the assistance <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy</b> supporters during the election campaign contributed to his November defeat by Ronald Reagan.|$|E

5|$|At his request, Ginsburg {{administered}} Vice President Al Gore's oath {{of office}} to a second term during the second presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton on January 20, 1997. She was the third woman to administer an inaugural {{oath of office}}. Ginsburg {{is believed to be}} the first Supreme Court justice to officiate a same sex-wedding, performing the August 31, 2013, ceremony <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy</b> Center President Michael Kaiser and John Roberts, a government economist. Earlier that summer, the Court had bolstered same-sex marriage rights in two separate cases. Ginsburg believed the issue being settled led same-sex couples to ask her to officiate as there was no longer the fear of compromising rulings on the issue.|$|E
5|$|President Kennedy's {{assassination}} in November 1963 led {{to calls}} to honor {{him with a}} place {{on one of the}} circulating coins, and the Kennedy half dollar was authorized by Congress on December 30. When 26 million of the new coins were issued on March 24, 1964, they were immediately hoarded, both by investors and by those wanting a memento <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> and the situation did not ease as more coins were produced. One-third of the record-breaking 202.5 million ounces of silver used in coinage in 1964 thus became coins that did not circulate. Congress allowed the Mint to continue to strike 1964-dated pieces into 1965, hoping to make them not worth putting aside.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} again appealed, {{this time to}} the House of Lords, where it was heard by Lord Templeman, Lord Goff, Lord Jauncey, Lord Lowry and Lord Woolf.

Goff first addressed the Court of Appeal's use of Ballard v Tomlinson, stating that the decision there as based on the facts of the case, and did not establish either a rule that there was a right to clear water, nor that there was strict liability attached to that right.|$|E

5|$|While Eisenhower {{appreciated}} Shoup's fiscal {{experience and}} apolitical outlook, Shoup was called upon most often by Kennedy. With Kennedy's {{relations with the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff strained, particularly following the Cuban Missile Crisis, he called upon Shoup privately for many consultations. Shoup's biographer Howard Jablon wrote that Shoup was Kennedy's favorite general. In turn, Shoup was the most supportive <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy</b> {{of all of the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff. Kennedy had asked Shoup to remain as Commandant for a second term in 1963, but Shoup declined in order to allow the advancement of other Marine generals.|$|E
5|$|Democratic U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy was re-elected in 2006, {{and died}} on August 25, 2009 from a {{malignant}} brain tumor. On September 24, 2009, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick appointed longtime friend <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy</b> and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul G. Kirk to succeed Kennedy until {{a special election}} could be held. Kirk's appointment was especially controversial, as the Governor's ability to appoint an interim Senator was removed during the Romney administration by the Democratic-controlled legislature, as a precaution if Senator and presidential nominee John Kerry was elected President in 2004. Laws surrounding Senate appointment were quickly changed following Kennedy's death. The Massachusetts Republican Party sued {{in an attempt to}} halt Kirk's appointment, but it was rejected by Suffolk Superior Court Judge Thomas Connolly.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the breakup}} of Slash's Snakepit, Slash {{announced}} he was to begin working on a solo album. Instead he later worked with The Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman and an unnamed bassist on a new project. Together with his former Guns N' Roses bandmates Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum, they formed The Project, that eventually became the hard rock supergroup Velvet Revolver following the addition of former Wasted Youth guitarist Dave Kushner, and then-former Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland. They released their debut album Contraband, in 2004, followed by Libertad in 2007, before they parted ways with Weiland and went on hiatus in 2008. With Velvet Revolver on hiatus, Slash began work on his debut solo album. Slash was released on March 31, 2010, and featured a number of guests such as Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother, M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold, Kid Rock, Ozzy Osbourne, Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge, and Fergie. His band for the tour {{in support of the}} album consisted <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> bassist Todd Kerns, and drummer Brent Fitz. It also included guitarist Bobby Schneck, formerly of Slash's Blues Ball.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interest}} of time (the striking of the new coin was to begin in January 1964), Roberts modified the existing bust <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy</b> he had created for use on the Kennedy medal in the Mint's Presidential series, while Frank Gasparro began modifications to the reverse he had created for the same medal. Both Roberts' and Gasparro's designs had been approved by Kennedy. Roberts had met with Kennedy in person to show him early models of the design; although the President expressed no opinion regarding the depiction, Roberts decided {{to make some changes}} after meeting him. After the Mint produced trial strikes, Jacqueline and Robert Kennedy were invited to view them. Mrs. Kennedy viewed the designs favorably, but suggested that the hair be altered slightly. It was also suggested that a full or half figure of the president be used instead of the profile, but Roberts noted that there was not enough time to produce an entirely new design because of the project's time constraints, and also that he believed the left profile would give a more attractive appearance.|$|E
5|$|It {{also became}} clear that Apollo would outgrow the Canaveral launch {{facilities}} in Florida. The two newest launch complexes were already being built for the Saturn I and IB rockets at the northernmost end: LC-34 and LC-37. But an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission, so land acquisition was started in July 1961 for a Launch Operations Center (LOC) immediately north of Canaveral at Merritt Island. The design, development and construction of the center was conducted by Kurt H. Debus, a member of Dr. Wernher von Braun's original V-2 rocket engineering team. Debus was named the LOC's first Director. Construction began in November 1962. Upon Kennedy's death, President Johnson issued an executive order on November 29, 1963, to rename the LOC and Cape Canaveral in honor <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy.</b>|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{had been}} a firm {{supporter}} <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy</b> in the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion and 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis; on taking office he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president, Fidel Castro. He maintained close relations with the Cuban-American exile community through his friend, Bebe Rebozo, who often suggested ways of irritating Castro. These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans, who feared Nixon might attack Cuba and break the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis. In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the understanding; despite his hard line against Castro, Nixon agreed. The process {{had not yet been}} completed when the Soviets began expanding their base at the Cuban port of Cienfuegos in October 1970. A minor confrontation ensued, which was concluded with an understanding that the Soviets would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles. The final round of diplomatic notes, reaffirming the 1962 accord, were exchanged in November.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt was captured on video by several cameras, including those {{belonging to the}} Big Three television networks; ABC began airing footage at 2:42p.m. All three networks erroneously reported that Brady had died. While the Cable News Network (CNN) {{did not have a}} camera of its own at the shooting it was able to use NBC's pool feed, and by staying on the story for 48 hours, the network, less than a year old, built a reputation for thoroughness. Shocked Americans gathered around television sets in homes and shopping centers. Some cited the alleged Curse of Tippecanoe, and others recalled the assassinations <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy</b> and Martin Luther King, Jr. Newspapers printed extra editions and used gigantic headlines; the United States Senate adjourned, interrupting debate of Reagan's economic proposals; and churches held prayer services.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} Clay Shaw {{takes place in}} 1969.

D. Tippit but the jury acquits Shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. The film reflects that members of that jury stated publicly that they believed there was a conspiracy behind the assassination, but not enough evidence to link Shaw to that conspiracy. Shaw {{died of lung cancer}} in 1974, but in 1979 Richard Helms testified that Clay Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contacts Division of the CIA. The end credits claim that records related to the assassination will be released to the public in 2029.|$|E

5|$|With no presidential ambitions left, Kennedy {{formed a}} good {{relationship}} with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993, despite his having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries. Kennedy floor-managed successful passage of Clinton's National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton health care plan, which was run by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a home page on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy</b> as old and out of touch.|$|E
5|$|After Gordon {{emerged into}} the Atlantic north of Cuba, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{tropical}} storm warning for southern Florida from Jupiter to the Dry Tortugas, and later extended it to Boca Grande up along the west coast; this was extended to Bayport {{on the west coast}} and to Titusville on the east coast while the storm was approaching the Florida Keys. When Gordon attained hurricane status and turned suddenly to the northwest, a hurricane warning was issued from Bogue Banks to the North Carolina/Virginia border. Florida governor Lawton Chiles activated the state's Emergency Operations Center. In the Florida Keys, state parks were closed, which forced some campers to leave, and all schools were closed. On the mainland, University of Miami and Miami Dade College were also closed. Space Shuttle Atlantis was forced to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California instead <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy</b> Space Center. The storm caused flights to be canceled or delayed at Miami International Airport, and nearly all flights were canceled to and from the Florida Keys. Hundreds of people evacuated to shelters in five counties in east-central Florida. In North Carolina, officials suggested people in low-lying areas to go to higher ground, but they did not issue evacuation orders.|$|E
5|$|By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put {{the serial}} into {{production}} and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, “Compassionate Leave”, depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as “the most sustained evocation of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember”. The budget was set at £2 million, of which £400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International. Director Martin Campbell came on board shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular {{to the notion that}} Craven had known about Emma's involvement with GAIA right from the start; this was removed at Campbell's behest. Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that “it didn't seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't {{be able to make it}} work for the audience”, a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was “likely not to come off as an effect”. Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy</b> Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, “Burden of Proof”, the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> speeches (especially {{his inaugural}} address) are {{considered}} iconic; {{and despite his}} relatively short term in office, {{and the lack of}} major legislative changes coming to fruition during his term, Americans regularly vote him {{as one of the best}} presidents, in the same league as Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and Franklin D.
