5|$|Construction was of crossed wooden poles, {{driven into}} the {{waterlogged}} soil to support a walkway that consisted mainly of planks of oak, laid end-to-end. The track was used {{for a period of}} only around ten years and was then abandoned, probably due to rising water levels. Following its discovery in 1970, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> has been left in its original location, with active conservation measures taken, including a water pumping and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> is stored at the British Museum and at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton.
