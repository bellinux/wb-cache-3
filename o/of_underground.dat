Underground tests measuring more than 4.75 on the Richter scale would also be barred, subject to revision as research on detection continued. Adopting Macmillan's quota compromise, the US proposed each nuclear state be subject to roughly 20 on-site inspections per year (the precise figure based on the frequency of seismic events).|$|E

40|$|Infiltration of {{rainfall}} into hillslopes {{is often an}} important factor in triggering landslides. Using underground water drainage works together with anti-slide piles has been an effective method of landslide control, yet their effectiveness is inadequately discussed in the literature. This paper studies the influence {{of rainfall}} on the change in the underground water level beneath a slope by real-time and synchronic monitoring of the rainfall, the underground water level in the boreholes, and the flow rate <b>of</b> the <b>underground</b> drainage tunnel. The effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>underground</b> drainage tunnel in preventing the rise <b>of</b> the <b>underground</b> water level <b>of</b> the slope is discussed. The researchers also study the deformation behavior of the anti-slide piles by monitoring the lateral displacement of the piles and analyzing the thrust that the anti-slide piles bear by numerical inversion techniques. The results indicate that there is an apparent relationship between the lag in the rising <b>of</b> the <b>underground</b> water level caused by a rainfall and that caused by the immediately previous rainfall. When there is a rainfall accumulation before the occurrence of a heavy rain, this particular heavy rainfall will cause a rapid rise <b>of</b> the <b>underground</b> water level beneath the slope. The monitoring data analysis shows that the flow rate <b>of</b> the <b>underground</b> drainage tunnel increases first, and then the <b>underground</b> water level <b>of</b> the slope rises after a rainfall. In other words, the flow rate <b>of</b> the <b>underground</b> drainage tunnel increases at a rate faster than that of the rise <b>of</b> the <b>underground</b> water level. Hence, the underground drainage tunnel can effectively lower the rise <b>of</b> the <b>underground</b> water level induced by a rainfall. Besides, based on the monitoring data of the lateral displacement of the anti-slide piles and subsequent analysis, the working state of the anti-slide piles is justified. It thus indirectly validates the benefits <b>of</b> using <b>underground</b> drainage tunnel in landslide control. © Springer-Verlag 2010. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
