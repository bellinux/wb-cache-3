How can transitional justice as {{a conceptual framework}} help {{to make sense of}} redress activity in established democracies? This article contributes to a growing discussion about the theorization of transitional justice. I argue that a broader conceptualization of transitional justice is instrumental not only for examining the past wrongdoings of established democracies, but also for giving coherence to diverse and competing discourses on colonial injustices. Drawing <b>on</b> <b>redress</b> politics in the Australian context, the article adopts nuanced understandings of both &# 039;transition&# 039; and &# 039;justice&# 039; as necessarily contested and incomplete.

40|$|This {{is a legal}} {{study of}} the {{arrangements}} made in eight European countries to secure the enforcement of social rights. It is a study carried out {{as a response to}} the overall bEUcitizen research interest in potential barriers to a EU-citizenship. The aim of the study is to investigate the possibilities and impediments for EU-citizens in Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom to enforce their (moral and/or legal) social rights in the fields of education, health care, housing and social assistance. Our focus is <b>on</b> <b>redress</b> mechanisms. It is a study that is comparative in several dimensions (between rights, between citizens, between countries and potentially also between different legal levels). Results indicate that if rights are provided and ifredress is offered, we have in the countries studied found no formal hindrances that discriminate against mobile EU-citizens. This said, we also learn that extra-procedural hindrances are a reality and that they create barriers especially problematic to mobile EU-citizens but also to EU-citizens living in their native countries. We conclude that the EU-citizenship project would gain from an exploration of new and innovative means of creating systems and institutions for the provision of basic, fundamental, social protection to secure life, dignity and means of social inclusion to all its citizens, no matter where in Europe they live or work. Europe is a region of welfare states and it is a barrier to the fulfilment of a well-functioning EU-citizenship not to fully recognise this fact...|$|E
40|$|In 1999 the Swedish Parliament {{decided to}} provide {{economic}} {{compensation to victims}} of involuntary sterilization, and in 2012 a similar law was enacted to redress neglect and abuse in foster homes and orphanages. This study explores the dilemmas that arise with reparations for past injustices, focusing on the process {{leading up to the}} reparation laws. Four themes are investigated: [1] state redress as the result of political action, [2] the identification and documentation of historical injustices, [3] how issues of responsibility were discussed and, [4] the juridification of redress. This study shows that it took approximately ten years for the first public claims for redress to gain enough political momentum to yield results. In both cases governmental commissions were set up. However, the commissions used different methods and materials. Involuntary sterilizations were mainly investigated through re-interpretation of existing source material, whereas child abuse was primarily documented through interviews. The two commissions also differed in how they judged the past: the Inquiry on Sterilization employed a historicising approach, while the Inquiry on Child Abuse and Neglect in Institutions and Foster Homes employed a contemporary normative approach. In both cases the moral responsibility of the state to give redress was stressed, rather than any legal liability. Redress was granted ex gratia, i. e. as an act of grace, through temporary laws, rather than as an admis-sion of legally established wrongdoing. Deserving victims were to be identified through court-like procedures, which sparked a debate on how to uphold due process and what kind of evidence would be admissible and sufficient. Hence reparations for historical injustices carry many paradoxes {{that need to be addressed}} in future discussions <b>on</b> <b>redress...</b>|$|E

In {{the context of the}} literature on the institutionalization of CSR and on critical CSR, it presents two main findings. First, it contributes to the CSR mainstream literature by confirming that CSR has not only become institutionalized in society but that a form of this institution is also present within MNCs. Secondly, it contributes to the critical CSR literature by suggesting that unlike broader notions of CSR shared between multiple stakeholders, MNCs practise a form of CSR that undermines the broader stakeholder concept. By increasingly focusing on strategic forms of CSR activity, MNCs are moving away from a societal understanding of CSR that focuses <b>on</b> <b>redressing</b> the impacts of their operations through stakeholder concerns, back to any activity that supports traditional business imperatives. The implications of this shift are considered using institutional theory to evaluate macro-institutional pressures for CSR activity and the agency of powerful incumbents in the contested field of CSR...|$|R
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDBlack South Africans {{have been}} exposed to an unequal and divided {{education}} system. It has been expected that the basis for an equitable education system would be laid in the post apartheid period. In this thesis I have provided an analysis of education policy development in South Africa between May 1994 and mid- 1997. My main aim has beento understand the policy vision that the post apartheid state has enacted as the basisfor educational reconstruction. The conceptual framework of this thesis is located in the academic fields of Education and Development and Policy Sociology. I have focused on the interaction between the broad delimitations set by the structural, economic and political dimensions in society on the one hand, and the political and policy dynamics that have given education policy its specific meaning on the other hand. The role of the government in enacting a specific policy vision has been at the centre of my analysis. The government has effected a conservative vision with the adoption of the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) macroeconomic strategy. GEAR has targeted the development of an export-based global economy along post fordist lines. Predicated upon an emphasis on fiscal discipline, the dominant policy orientation has supported equity but without an emphasis <b>on</b> <b>redress.</b> This approach has not provided the necessary basis for education reconstruction. The National Qualifications Framework (NQF) and Outcomes-based education (OBE) embody a definite '/ision in terms of which education policy would be aligned with economic development. This vision is based on the false assumption that education should playa fundamental role in producing the sophisticated labour demands of a globally competitive economy. The logic of both GEAR and the NQF is internally inconsistent and the relationship between these two policy frameworks is unsustainable. South Afric...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the 1990 s, {{international}} financial multilateral agencies promoted {{changes in the}} way health systems were financed and organized. Three decades later, equity and efficiency are still central problems of the health systems in developing countries. The present article focuses on the health sector reforms introduced in Latin America in order to draw policy lessons for Spanish aid. One of those reforms, the introduction of competition in health insurance management and provision and the increase of private sector participation – managed competition –, was widely promoted, despite the lack of empirical evidence and the opposition from public and scientific sectors. Years after its implementation, health system financing is still inequitable and access to health services is far from universal and adequate due to the barriers imposed by insurers, among other reasons. Moreover, segmentation in healthcare provision and inefficiency persist in healthcare systems that are expensive to manage.

Biblical theology provides penetrating narratives into the nature of fallen humanity and its proclivity toward self-aggrandizement and strife. Psychosocial analysis recognizes that the processes of socialization so necessary to promote belonging and identity formation, are also quite capable of turning others into objects of scorn and hatred. Yet, both theology and psychology, posit that despite however distorted human nature may be, it has the potential of being re-created. We locate the work of reconciliation as beginning with the being and action of God on behalf of humanity and demonstrated powerfully in the transformation of the apostles in the book of Acts...|$|R

However, this form of physics has now been comprehensively displaced by progress within Western science, notably the rise of the new paradigm of science formalised as systems theory. This utilises new mathematical techniques incorporating Newtonian science within a far larger field of understanding that also includes the complex, unpredicateble and fluid aspects of the real world. However, the institutions of the modern world, especially industrial globalisation, remain based on the principles of the Newtonian world view that sees the universe as ultimately stable and ordered, and human activity fundamentally separate from nature. Environmentalism and green economics are focused <b>on</b> <b>redressing</b> the imbalances between humanity and nature that are being caused by the success of the industrial revolution created by Newtonian physics.
