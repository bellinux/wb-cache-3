5000|$|An iris cyst, or uveal cyst, {{is a small}} hollow {{structure}} either {{attached to}} the iris of the <b>eye</b> <b>or</b> floating <b>free</b> in the anterior chamber. An iris cyst is composed of a single cell layer of epithelium and is filled with fluid. [...] It is most commonly seen as secondary to inflammation in the eye, especially with canine glaucoma. They are most commonly seen in dogs. Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, and Boston Terriers are the most commonly affected breeds. [...] Iris cysts also occur in cats and horses. The cysts are usually free floating in dogs, attached to the pupillary margin in cats, and present {{in the interior of}} the iris (especially blue irises) in horses.|$|R
