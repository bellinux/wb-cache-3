5|$|To {{record the}} album, Jackson {{suggested}} a small studio located outside of Washington, D.C. in Silver Spring, Maryland. The sessions {{took place in}} September and October 1973 at Silver Spring's D Sound Studios. According to Scott-Heron, the studio's main room was so small that when the two musicians recorded, Jackson was forced <b>out</b> <b>next</b> to the cooler, playing flute in the studio's hallway while Scott-Heron sang in the main room. However, Scott-Heron felt comfortable in the small studio. Jose Williams was enlisted as the recording engineer for the album. Williams assisted Scott-Heron and Jackson, who were credited for production under the title Perpis-Fall Music, Inc., with production, and he engineered the album's recordings entirely himself.|$|E

25|$|In March 1909, Roose {{travelled}} with Wales to play Ireland in a British Home Championship match. He {{appeared at}} Liverpool station {{with one hand}} heavily bandaged, telling the waiting press that he had broken two fingers but would nevertheless play in the match. Roose's Welsh team-mate Billy Meredith, suspecting trickery, peered through the keyhole of the goalkeeper's hotel room soon after their arrival in Belfast and saw his friend remove the bandage and wiggle his fingers {{with no sign of}} discomfort. News of Roose's disability having spread through the city, a huge and expectant crowd turned <b>out</b> <b>next</b> day in the hope of witnessing an Irish victory. Instead Wales won the game 3–2, Roose himself playing superbly.|$|E

25|$|The tour's final {{match was}} at The Oval. A strong Players side won the toss, but had reached only 283/6 {{by the end}} of the first day, Hayward making 74, Tyldesley 56 and James Iremonger 66. When the innings was {{completed}} next day, Saunders had figures of 4/50. The Australians reached 208/2 in reply, 75 minutes being lost to rain, with Trumper scoring 96 and Hill on 79 not out. Hill was soon <b>out</b> <b>next</b> morning for 81 and there was a minor collapse to 233/5. But nearly 200 runs were added for the last five wickets, with Trumble making 68. Rhodes took 5/115. The tour ended on a note of anticlimax, with the home side playing out time in their second innings.|$|E
25|$|Adams's second work, her Summary History of New England, {{was written}} after an {{experience}} in country school-teaching, and {{was published in}} 1799. In 1801 a third edition of her first work, further enlarged, was brought <b>out.</b> <b>Next,</b> she prepared a volume of selections from various authors under the title of Truth and Excellence of the Christian Religion, working up her material in the Boston bookshops, since {{she was unable to}} purchase or borrow the books she desired to consult. In 1805, there appeared an abridgment of the history of New England, which brought her into conflict with the Rev. Jedidiah Morse, author of the first geography of the U.S., who had published a similar work. A sharp controversy ensued in which the woman's side was championed by several friends, chief among them being Shaw, one of the Anthology Club men.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} the Tag Team Turmoil {{match for the}} World Tag Team Championship. Tajiri and William Regal were the champions heading into the match. The teams would come out at random, and it was The Heart Throbs who entered first, with the champions Tajiri and Regal coming <b>out</b> <b>next.</b> Tajiri {{utilized}} a lot of kicks and then locked in the Tarantula. The Heart Throbs then kept Tajiri isolated, but Tajiri pinned Antonio with a sunset flip. Simon Dean and Maven entered into the match next, trying to pick apart the weakened Tajiri. Their inclusion in the match did not last very long as Regal made the tag and cleaned house, putting Dean away with a knee to the head. La Résistance came in next, but Regal and Tajiri tried to fight back. Regal was then rolled up, {{with a handful of}} tights, eliminating he and Tajiri and guaranteeing new champions. Rosey and The Hurricane were the last two men to enter the match. Hurricane was then smashed on the turnbuckle post. Hurricane and Rosey got the pin when Hurricane leapt off the shoulders of Rosey, who was perched on the top rope to grab the win.|$|E

25|$|England's captain Heather Knight won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. Their openers, Lauren Winfield (24 runs) and Tammy Beaumont (23), made steady progress, putting on 47 runs before Winfield was bowled by Rajeshwari Gayakwad. Beaumont was out three overs later, {{caught in the}} deep off the bowling of Poonam Yadav. This brought Heather Knight (1) to the crease, but she lasted just seven balls before also being {{dismissed}} by Yadav, leg before wicket (lbw; via DRS). Sarah Taylor (45) and Natalie Sciver (51) steadied the ship somewhat, putting on 83 runs for the fourth wicket whilst light rain fell. With the score at 146, Taylor was caught behind from the bowling of Jhulan Goswami. Goswami then had Fran Wilson <b>out</b> <b>next</b> ball, for a golden duck. Sciver also fell to Goswami a few overs later, unsuccessfully challenging an lbw decision. Katherine Brunt (34) and Jenny Gunn (25 not out) put on 32 runs for the seventh wicket before Brunt was run out by Goswami with a direct hit. Gunn continued on with Laura Marsh (14 not out) {{for the last four}} overs, with England finishing on 228/7 from their 50 overs. Jhulan Goswami was the pick of the Indian bowlers, finished with 3/23.|$|E

According to Songz {{in an interview with}} GoWhereHipHop, Fabolous decided to record a verse for track the day Ready was set to be mastered, which was during the week of the release of his fifth studio album Loso's Way. In an August 2009 interview, when asked about Fabolous's appearance on the track Songz insinuated that [...] "Say Aah" [...] would be released as one of the last singles from Ready, calling it [...] "one of the hottest club records to be <b>out</b> <b>next</b> year." [...] The first remix of the song to be released also features American rapper Young Jeezy, while another features fellow American rappers Juelz Santana and Ace Hood. Female rappers Shonie, Trina and Brianna released a [...] "Ladies Remix" [...] to the song on December 2009. R singer Teairra Mari released her remix of the song in January 2010.|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Chilean newspaper La Tercera in October 2010, de la Rocha allegedly confirmed that a new album was in the works, with a possibility of a 2011 release. De la Rocha is reported as saying, [...] "We are all bigger and more mature and we do not fall into the problems we faced 10 or 15 years ago. This is different and we project a lot: we are working on a new album due <b>out</b> <b>next</b> year, perhaps summer for the northern hemisphere". However, in early May 2011, guitarist Tom Morello said that the band were not working on a new album, but would not rule out the possibility of future studio work. [...] "The band is not writing songs, the band is not in the studio", Morello told The Pulse of Radio. [...] "We get along famously and we all, you know, intend to do more Rage Against the Machine stuff in the future, but beyond sort of working out a concert this year, there's nothing else on the schedule (for 2011)". The band created its own festival, the L.A. Rising. As Morello stated, the only Rage Against the Machine appearance for 2011 was a performance on July 30 at the L.A. Rising festival with El Gran Silencio, Immortal Technique, Lauryn Hill, Rise Against and Muse. As of mid-2012, there are no plans for any more shows. During {{an interview}} on July 30, 2011, Commerford seemingly contradicted Morello's comments, stating that new material was being written, and specific plans {{for the next two years}} were in place.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the CD-ROM based Saturn port, EGM {{commented that}} the {{graphics}} are identical to the arcade version but that there are missing sound effects and [...] "unbearable" [...] slowdown when first performing a special move. They rated it the best home version of the game to date but felt that with Mortal Kombat II having considerably aged by this point, any port needed to be near arcade perfect to stand <b>out.</b> <b>Next</b> Generation felt that the Saturn version was arcade perfect, but that the Mortal Kombat series {{as a whole was}} grossly overrated and lacked any gameplay innovations to make it stand out from other fighting games. They summarized that [...] "if you are a fan of the game (and you know who you are), then the Saturn version is everything you can hope for - an arcade-perfect translation - and yet, there is nothing outside of a flashy presentation and a little gore to recommend this game over a million others just like it." [...] Scary Larry of GamePro agreed that the Saturn port [...] "duplicates the arcade version perfectly", but argued that the slowdown and load times make the game frustrating to play. He concluded that the conversion would make a decent holdover until Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 hit the Saturn, but fails to measure up to Mortal Kombat 3 on the PlayStation. Sega Saturn Magazine was extremely disappointed with {{the final version of the}} Saturn port, calling it [...] "much worse than any of the versions seen on the cartridge format," [...] as opposed to the vastly superior pre-release version they had reviewed five months earlier.|$|E

2500|$|Complex {{named it}} the sixth best {{album of the}} first-half of 2014. Writing for them, Justin Charity said, [...] "ScHoolboy gave us a tape full of dope beats and {{aggressive}} rhymes.

[...] "Man of the Year" [...] and [...] "Break the Bank" [...] are the obvious arena-pleasers, and they're obviously successful as such, but Oxymoron leads with Q's funkier foot. Featuring West Coast brethren Kurupt and Tyler The Creator, [...] "The Purge" [...] is, literally, a fire engine melody. Oxymoron is grim, and it's gangsta, without once forgetting to have fun.

Surviving seven balls to tea without further loss, West Indies were in for a nasty surprise, as the new batsman Runako Morton departed in Vaas' next over. However, Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Sylvester Joseph tried to rebuild, but were shaken – often beaten by Vaas and Malinga's deliveries.
