5|$|The {{first modern}} wave of {{economic}} globalization began {{during the period}} of 1870–1914, marked by transportation expansion, record levels of migration, enhanced communications, trade expansion, and growth in capital transfers. During the mid-nineteenth century, the passport system in Europe dissolved as rail transport expanded rapidly. Most countries issuing passports did not require their carry, thus people could travel freely without them. The standardization of international passports would not arise until 1980 under the guidance of the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization. From 1870 to 1915, 36 million Europeans migrated away from Europe. Approximately 25 million (or 70%) of these travelers migrated to the United States, while most of the rest reached Canada, Australia, Argentina, and Brazil. Europe itself experienced an influx of foreigners from 1860 to 1910, growing from 0.7% of the population to 1.8%. While the absence <b>of</b> <b>meaningful</b> passport requirements allowed for free travel, migration on such an enormous scale would have been prohibitively difficult if not for technological advances in transportation, particularly the expansion of railway travel and the dominance of steam-powered boats over traditional sailing ships. World railway mileage grew from 205,000 kilometers in 1870 to 925,000 kilometers in 1906, while steamboat cargo tonnage surpassed that of sailboats in the 1890s. Advancements such as the telephone and wireless telegraphy (the precursor to radio) revolutionized telecommunication by providing instantaneous communication. In 1866, the first transatlantic cable was laid beneath the ocean to connect London and New York, while Europe and Asia became connected through new landlines.|$|E

The {{objective was to}} investigate the association between infant feeding practices and the first <b>meaningful</b> words <b>of</b> Thai children. The participants enrolled in this longitudinal study were 4245 children born between July 2000 and June 2002. They resided in 3 rural and 2 urban areas of Thailand and were followed from birth to childhood. The outcome was time from birth to expression <b>of</b> first <b>meaningful</b> words. Outcome and feeding information were gathered using a diary method, with parents and caregivers recording daily development. Nonstatistically significant corresponding reduction in time to expression <b>of</b> first <b>meaningful</b> words was found among children who were breastfed, and this increased with duration of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding may reduce the time taken for expression <b>of</b> first <b>meaningful</b> words by about 2 % (hazard ratio = 0. 98; 95 % confidence interval = 0. 94 to 1. 01).

25|$|Bartlett first {{formulated}} his revisionary methodology {{within a}} phenomenological {{framework in which}} the concept of reference plays a logically primitive role; he later separated his approach to conceptual therapy from phenomenology. This {{took the form of}} a theoretically neutral metalogic of reference. Bartlett applied the resulting methodology to a group of conceptually basic concepts (for example, space, time, causality, consciousness, etc.) that both are relied upon in much ordinary thinking and are used in the formulation of scientific theories. Such applications, Bartlett sought to show, bring to light that many basic concepts, which tend to be routinely employed unquestioningly, are self-referentially inconsistent and stand in need <b>of</b> <b>meaningful</b> substitutes, for which he developed self-referentially consistent replacement concepts.|$|E

This has included the development of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, which addresses homelessness on the federal level in addition to connecting homelesss individuals to resources at the state level. All individuals who are in need of assistance are able, in theory, to access employment and training services under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), although this is contingent upon funding and program support by the government, with veterans also being able to use the Veterans Workforce Investment Program.|$|E

Stage 1 <b>of</b> <b>meaningful</b> use of certified EHR systems requires that practices provide at least 50 percent of their patients with a copy of their health records upon request.

By June 2012, 3.9 million Kaiser members were enrolled in this program. For the first half of 2012, members viewed 2.5 million lab results, sent 1 million e-mails to physicians, and scheduled 230,000 appointments monthly, demonstrating ease of use and convenience.|$|E

25|$|The {{attitude}} of Vienna Circle towards metaphysics is well expressed by Carnap {{in the article}} 'Überwindung der Metaphysik durch Logische Analyse der Sprache' in Erkenntnis, vol. 2, 1932 (English translation 'The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language' in Sarkar, Sahotra, ed., Logical empiricism at its peak: Schlick, Carnap, and Neurath, New York : Garland Pub., 1996, pp.10–31). A language—says Carnap—consists of a vocabulary, i.e., a set <b>of</b> <b>meaningful</b> words, and a syntax, i.e., {{a set of rules}} governing the formation of sentences from the words of the vocabulary. Pseudo-statements, i.e., sequences of words that at first sight resemble statements but in reality have no meaning, are formed in two ways: either meaningless words occur in them, or they are formed in an invalid syntactical way. According to Carnap, pseudo-statements of both kinds occur in metaphysics.|$|E
25|$|Another {{autonomous}} {{philosophy of}} biology {{is represented by}} Guenther Witzany and his theory of biocommunication: Living nature is structured and organized by language and communication within and among cells, tissues, organs and organisms. This means that besides human language and communication every living entity is competent to use signs with which it can differentiate between self and non-self. The communicative competence serves for coordination of group behavior (tissues, organs, organisms). Biocommunication research is applied to all organismic kingdoms based on empirical data. Additionally the biocommunication method investigates nucleotide sequences as natural code which is structured according combinatorial, context-sensitive and content-specific rules. Natural genome editing from a biocommunicative perspective consequently is investigated as competent agent-driven generation and integration <b>of</b> <b>meaningful</b> nucleotide sequences into pre-existing genomic content arrangements of host organisms. Such natural genome editing agents can (re)combine and (re)regulate host genome content according to context-dependent (i.e. adaptational) purposes. Such active agent-driven processes contradict passive error replication (mutation) narratives to explain emergence of genetic diversity.|$|E
25|$|The {{main reason}} for using {{mathematical}} models and diagrams in trade studies is to provide estimates of system effectiveness, performance or technical attributes, and cost from a set of known or estimable quantities. Typically, a collection of separate models is needed to provide all of these outcome variables. The heart of any mathematical model is a set <b>of</b> <b>meaningful</b> quantitative relationships among its inputs and outputs. These relationships {{can be as simple}} as adding up constituent quantities to obtain a total, or as complex as a set of differential equations describing the trajectory of a spacecraft in a gravitational field. Ideally, the relationships express causality, not just correlation. Furthermore, key to successful systems engineering activities are also the methods with which these models are efficiently and effectively managed and used to simulate the systems. However, diverse domains often present recurring problems of modeling and simulation for systems engineering, and new advancements are aiming to crossfertilize methods among distinct scientific and engineering communities, under the title of 'Modeling & Simulation-based Systems Engineering'.|$|E
