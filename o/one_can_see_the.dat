5|$|This was a fast-spreading rift; the {{resulting}} basalts show little {{interaction with the}} then-existing rock. These immense volumes of mafic lava were generated in two major pulses, mostly via a hot mantle plume. Along the North Shore of Lake Superior, <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> solidified lava (igneous rock) most everywhere. In the Rove region the magma didn't reach the surface; it intruded into fractures in the formation and slowly cooled to become diabase (rather than basalt). These solidified bodies are the Pigeon River and Logan Intrusion diabases.|$|E

One example is Making Stuff, which includes anything which children like to do for fun, including arts and crafts, collections, games, cooking, putting on plays, and magic tricks. Another is Mystery, which includes nonfiction on codes, crime, optical illusions, puzzles, spies and unexplained mysteries such as the Bermuda Triangle, as well as mystery and detective fiction.

25|$|If {{one looks}} at the fields around the Deserted Village and right up the mountain, <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> tracks in the fields of 'lazy beds', which is the way crops like {{potatoes}} were grown. In Achill, as in many areas of Ireland, a system called 'Rundale' was used for farming. This meant that the land around a village was rented from a landlord. This land was then shared by all the villagers to graze their cattle and sheep. Each family would then have two or three small pieces of land scattered about the village, which they used to grow crops.|$|E

25|$|When {{topology}} {{is routinely}} {{described in terms}} of properties invariant under homeomorphism, <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> underlying idea in operation. The groups involved will be infinite-dimensional in almost all cases – and not Lie groups – but the philosophy is the same. Of course this mostly speaks to the pedagogical influence of Klein. Books such as those by H.S.M. Coxeter routinely used the Erlangen program approach to help 'place' geometries. In pedagogic terms, the program became transformation geometry, a mixed blessing {{in the sense that it}} builds on stronger intuitions than the style of Euclid, but is less easily converted into a logical system.|$|E
25|$|Assuming a {{negligible}} weight {{as compared to}} the weight of the deck and vehicles being supported, the main cables of a suspension bridge will form a parabola (very similar to a catenary, the form the unloaded cables take before the deck is added). <b>One</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> shape from the constant increase of the gradient of the cable with linear (deck) distance, this increase in gradient at each connection with the deck providing a net upward support force. Combined with the relatively simple constraints placed upon the actual deck, this makes the suspension bridge much simpler to design and analyze than a cable-stayed bridge, where the deck is in compression.|$|E
