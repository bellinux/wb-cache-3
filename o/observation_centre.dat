It examines more in particular the construction of such discourses through daily practices of 2 ̆ 7 scientific 2 ̆ 7 observation of juvenile delinquents within Belgium’s central <b>observation</b> <b>centres</b> for boys (Mol) and for girls (Saint-Servais) between  1913 and  1965. Both <b>observation</b> <b>centres</b> were established shortly after {{the enactment of the}} Belgian Child Protection Act of  1912, that introduced the instrument of social and medical-psychological inquiry in the judicial treatment of delinquent youth. This not only reflected a significant shift in the problematisation of juvenile delinquency, it also created a new, formal and institutional ‘space for experts’ within the juvenile justice system, as a result of which medical and psychological expertises rapidly begun to influence both sentencing and re-education practices, even if this influence was contested by the judicial power. Drawing on the individual files of young delinquents placed under observation, the paper examines how their being at-risk and risk taking were translated into medical and psychological deficiencies. Through a comparison between both <b>observation</b> <b>centres,</b> it seeks to highlight the highly gendered nature of these new discourses, as well as significant shifts in experts’ definitions of moral danger and risk between the pre- and the post-war period...|$|R

This article looks at the process of marginalisation undertaken towards delinquent girls in Belgium, from 1920 to 1970. Belgium {{is considered one of}} the pioneers in the field of observing minors: <b>observation</b> <b>centres</b> opened shortly after the creation of juvenile courts (1912). At this time, children and young people were considered a bio-psycho-social unit that had to be analysed from a social, moral, and medical point of view. This paper is interested in what is and what is meant by observation of delinquent girls: origin and theoretical foundations of the expertise and expert practices with girls. The paper is organised in two parts. Part one analyses the main processes justifying expertise practices through the development of disciplines interested in the study of the delinquent child. This first part is based on Belgian and international literature about scientific assessment of delinquent people. Part two analyses assessment practices organised in “observation” centres for delinquent girls in Belgium. This second part is based on the study of 189 observation reports from six different <b>observation</b> <b>centres</b> (public or private) for girls. The observation of institutionalised girls serves as a perfect illustration of how such a "case" was constructed and how these marginalised girls were socially disqualified, as set forth in the observation reports...|$|R

40|$|Cross-domain {{ground-based}} {{cloud classification}} is a challenging issue as {{the appearance of}} cloud images from different cloud databases possesses extreme variations. Two fundamental problems which are essential for cross-domain ground-based cloud classification are feature representation and similarity measurement. In this paper, we propose an effective feature representation called transfer of local features (TLF), and measurement method called discriminative metric learning (DML). The TLF is a generalized representation framework that can integrate various kinds of local features, e. g., local binary patterns (LBP), local ternary patterns (LTP) and completed LBP (CLBP). In order to handle domain shift, such as variations of illumination, image resolution, capturing location, occlusion and so on, the TLF mines the maximum response in regions to make a stable representation for domain variations. We also propose to learn a discriminant metric, simultaneously. We make use of sample pairs and the relationship among cloud classes to learn the distance metric. Furthermore, {{in order to improve}} the practicability of the proposed method, we replace the original cloud images with the convolutional activation maps which are then applied to TLF and DML. The proposed method has been validated on three cloud databases which are collected in China alone, provided by Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS), Meteorological <b>Observation</b> <b>Centre</b> (MOC), and Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP).

Future {{astrophysics}} and {{cosmic microwave}} background space missions operating in the far-infrared to millimetre part of the spectrum will require very large arrays of ultra-sensitive detectors in combination with high multiplexing factors and efficient low-noise and low-power readout systems. We have developed a demonstrator system suitable for such applications. Methods. The system combines a 961 pixel imaging array based upon Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) with a readout system capable of reading out all pixels simultaneously with only one readout cable pair and a single cryogenic amplifier. We evaluate, in a representative environment, the system performance in terms of sensitivity, dynamic range, optical efficiency, cosmic ray rejection, pixel-pixel crosstalk and overall yield at an <b>observation</b> <b>centre</b> frequency of 850 GHz and 20 % fractional bandwidth. Results. The overall system has an excellent sensitivity, with an average detector sensitivity measured using a thermal calibration source. At a loading power per pixel of 50 fW we demonstrate white, photon noise limited detector noise down to 300 mHz. The dynamic range would allow the detection of ~ 1 Jy bright sources {{within the field of}} view without tuning the readout of the detectors. The expected dead time due to cosmic ray interactions, when operated in an L 2 or a similar far-Earth orbit, is found to be < 4 %. Additionally, the achieved pixel yield is 83 % and the crosstalk between the pixels is <− 30 dB. Conclusions.

A P 2 Y 12 receptor antagonist, ticagrelor, is unique among antiplatelet drugs, because ticagrelor inhibits the platelet P 2 Y 12 receptor in a reversible manner, and because it demonstrates a wide palette of advantageous pleiotropic effects associated with the increased concentration of adenosine. The pleiotropic effects of ticagrelor comprise cardioprotection, restoration of the myocardium after an ischemic event, promotion of the release of anticoagulative factors and, eventually, anti-inflammatory effects. Beyond the advantageous effects, the increased concentration of adenosine is responsible for some of ticagrelor’s adverse effects, including dyspnea and bradycardia. Large-scale clinical trials demonstrated that both standard 12 -month therapy and long-term use of ticagrelor {{reduce the risk of}} cardiovascular events in patients with ACS, but at the expense of a higher risk of major bleeding. Further trials focused on the use of ticagrelor in conditions other than ACS, including ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease and status after coronary artery bypass grafting. The results of these trials suggest comparable efficacy and safety of ticagrelor and clopidogrel in extra-coronary indications, but firm conclusions are anticipated from currently ongoing studies. Here, we summarize current evidence on the superiority of ticagrelor over other P 2 Y 12 antagonists in ACS, discuss the mechanism underlying the drug–drug interactions and pleiotropic effects of ticagrelor, and present future perspectives of non-coronary indications for ticagrelor.

40|$|The {{creation}} {{and evolution of}} juvenile institutions in 19 th century Belgium corresponds to two approaches, two eras and two reformers (Edouard Ducpétiaux and Jules LeJeune).

Then, the image of children in danger who should be protected against the bad influences of their families becomes dominant. The passage from punishment to protection involves the adoption of social and psychological criteria to classify children along new categories. The scope of the institutions is being widened as their mission becomes centered on all types of children "in danger". As institutions become challenged, family placements become more popular and are intended to compensate for the weaknesses and bad influences of the natural family.
