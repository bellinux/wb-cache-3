50|$|Minogue has {{initiated}} many legal challenges against the Victorian government, mostly concerning his treatment while imprisoned.

5000|$|Three notable hypertext-based systems {{emerged in}} the 1980s, {{that may have been}} {{inspired}} by ZOG, KMS and/or one another: the NoteCards system, developed in 1984 and released by Xerox in 1985; Janet Walker's Symbolics Document Examiner, created in 1985 for the <b>operation</b> <b>manuals</b> of Symbolics computers; and Bill Atkinson's WildCard application, on which he began work in 1985, and which was released in 1987 as HyperCard.

This can include proper instructions in maintenance manuals, <b>operation</b> <b>manuals,</b> emergency procedures, and others to prevent systematic human errors that may result in system failures. These should be written by trained or experienced technical authors using so-called simplified English or Simplified Technical English, where words and structure are specifically chosen and created so as to reduce ambiquity or risk of confusion (e.g. an [...] "replace the old part" [...] could ambiguously refer to a swapping a worn-out part with a non worn-out part, or replacing a part with one using a more recent and hopefully improved design).|$|E
5000|$|Multiplayer {{gameplay}} is class based, {{with six}} classes available. The Commando {{is the standard}} grunt class, with an assault rifle; the Sharpshooter specializes in long range with conventional sniper rifles; the Guerrilla excels in close combat and ambush with shotguns; the Rebel uses explosives and fire with flamethrowers and rocket launchers; the Gunner provides heavy firepower with light machine guns and rocket launchers; and the Saboteur uses stealth and silenced weapons [...] Each class can choose an appropriate primary weapon and a side arm, as well as explosives such as frag grenades or Molotov cocktails. Players are able to unlock more powerful weapons within each class by spending up to three [...] "blood diamonds" [...] on a class; the diamonds are earned through the experience points from killing other players and completing objectives.

40|$|A {{knowledge}} based system (KBS) methodology designed to study human machine interactions and levels of autonomy in allocation of process control tasks is presented. Users are provided with <b>operation</b> <b>manuals</b> {{to assist them in}} normal and abnormal situations. Unfortunately, <b>operation</b> <b>manuals</b> usually represent only the functioning logic of the system to be controlled. The user logic is often totally different. A method is focused on which illicits user logic to refine a KBS shell called an Operator Assistant (OA). If the OA is to help the user, it is necessary to know what level of autonomy gives the optimal performance of the overall man-machine system. For example, for diagnoses that must be carried out carefully by both the user and the OA, interactions are frequent, and processing is mostly sequential. Other diagnoses can be automated, in which the case the OA must be able to explain its reasoning in an appropriate level of detail. OA structure was used to design a working KBS called HORSES (Human Orbital Refueling System Expert System). Protocol analysis of pilots interacting with this system reveals that the a-priori analytical knowledge becomes more structured with training and the situation patterns more complex and dynamic. This approach can improve the a-priori understanding of human and automatic reasoning...|$|E
40|$|An optimum {{design and}} a control method of a soil warming system with heat {{generated}} in compost were investigated, following {{a concept of}} process design. Provided {{that many of the}} input data such as thermal physical properties of compost bed, the amount of heat required to soil warming, and the micrometeorological condition in a greenhouse are given and that the dimensions of the tube for heat extraction is premised, there are only two decision variables to be optimized. One is the space of arrangement of the tubes for heat extraction and the other is the flow rate of medium fluid in the tubes. Optimum numerical values of the decision variables were obtained, taking account of stability in operation, increase in heat efficiency and reduction of the cost of equipments of heat source. Assuming that the system is applied to the protected cultivation in a small scale, a representative example of the flow sheet of the system was proposed, and <b>operation</b> <b>manuals</b> of the system were described. Optimum numerical values of the decision variables, <b>operation</b> <b>manuals</b> and the flow sheet proposed here would become the basis of the detailed design of equipments and devices of the system. 堆肥発酵熱を利用した土壌加温システムの最適設計・制御の方法を, プロセス設計の概念に基づいて検討した。混合素材の熱的物性値, 土壌加温に必要な熱量, 温室内微気象条件などが前提条件として与えられ, 熱抽出管の規格が決められているとき, 最適化によって決定すべき決定変数は, 熱抽出管の配管間隔と熱抽出管内の通水量の二つで, 操作の安定性, 熱効率の向上, 熱源装置の設備費軽減の観点からそれらの最適値が求められた。更に, 本システムを小規模施設へ適用することを前提に, 土壌加温トータルシステムのフローシートの一例を示し, 操作要領を記述した。ここで得られた決定変数の数値, 操作要領, フローシートは機器設備の詳細設計を行う際の基礎となるだろう...|$|E
