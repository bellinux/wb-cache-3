5|$|Claudius of Turin (or Claude) (fl. 810–827) was the Catholic {{bishop of}} Turin from 817 until his death. He was a courtier of Louis the Pious {{and was a}} writer during the Carolingian Renaissance. He is most noted for {{teaching}} iconoclasm, a radical idea {{at that time in}} Latin Church, and for some teachings that prefigured those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> Reformation. He was attacked as a heretic in written works by Saint Dungal and Jonas of Orléans.|$|E
5|$|During the regency, he and {{his mother}} {{abolished}} the Va'a Tai 'Aru, the law, enacted by his father, which had made crimes such as murder, treason and adultery punishable by death.

5|$|The Battle of Besançon (21 June 1575) was a sectarian {{conflict}} between the Protestants and Catholics in the French city of Besançon {{in the region of}} Franche-Comté. Prior to the battle, the Huguenots, accused of heresy, had been expelled from the city and fled to the County of Montbéliard and Switzerland; the outcasts formed an army and planned an attempt to retake Besançon and turn the city into a stronghold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> Reformation. By the time the armed Protestants had reached the city of Besançon however, their army had dwindled because of several mishaps. Nonetheless, the battle began and raged for several hours; the outcome was an overwhelming Catholic victory. The majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> army managed to escape, but those who were captured were hanged as traitors. For over two centuries after the battle, Protestantism in Besançon was repressed.|$|E

5|$|Walsingham {{advocated}} {{direct intervention}} in the Netherlands in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> revolt against Spain, {{on the grounds that}} although wars of conquest were unjust, wars in defence of religious liberty and freedom were not. Cecil was more circumspect and advised a policy of mediation, a policy that Elizabeth endorsed. Walsingham was sent on a special embassy to the Netherlands in 1578, to sound out a potential peace deal and gather military intelligence.|$|E
5|$|A year later, Catherine was {{banished from}} court, and her rooms {{were given to}} Anne. Anne was an unusually educated and {{intellectual}} woman for her time, and was keenly absorbed and engaged with the ideas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> Reformers, though {{the extent to which}} she herself was a committed Protestant is much debated. When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died, Anne's influence and the need to find a trustworthy supporter of the annulment had Thomas Cranmer appointed to the vacant position. This was approved by the Pope, unaware of the King's nascent plans for the Church.|$|E

5|$|In 1798, members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> Dissenter {{tradition}} (mainly Presbyterian) made {{common cause}} with Roman Catholics {{in a republican}} rebellion inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen, {{with the aim of}} creating an independent Ireland. Despite assistance from France the rebellion was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed Acts of Union that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In May 1569, Elizabeth {{attempted}} {{to mediate the}} restoration of Mary in return for guarantees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> religion, but a convention held at Perth rejected the deal overwhelmingly. Norfolk continued to scheme for a marriage with Mary, and Elizabeth imprisoned him in the Tower of London between October 1569 and August 1570. Early in the following year, Moray was assassinated. Moray's death coincided with a rebellion in the North of England, led by Catholic earls, which persuaded Elizabeth that Mary was a threat. English troops intervened in the Scottish civil war, consolidating {{the power of the}} anti-Marian forces. Elizabeth's principal secretaries Sir Francis Walsingham and William Cecil, Lord Burghley, watched Mary carefully with the aid of spies placed in Mary's household.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 15th century, the Renaissance spirit spread to Germany and the Low Countries, where the {{development}} of the printing press (ca. 1450) and early Renaissance artists such as the painters Jan van Eyck (1395–1441) and Hieronymus Bosch (1450–1516) and the composers Johannes Ockeghem (1410–1497), Jacob Obrecht (1457–1505) and Josquin des Prez (1455–1521) predated the influence from Italy. In the early Protestant areas of the country humanism became closely linked to the turmoil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> Reformation, and the art and writing of the German Renaissance frequently reflected this dispute. However, the gothic style and medieval scholastic philosophy remained exclusively until the turn of the 16th century. Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg (ruling 1493–1519) was the first truly Renaissance monarch of the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E
50|$|All of {{this was}} overshadowed in July 1630 — Gustavus Adolphus landed in Pomerania with 4,000 men in {{response}} to <b>the</b> persecution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestants.</b> Without Wallenstein, Ferdinand had to turn to Maximillian and Tilly to stop the new threat.|$|R
50|$|By {{the sixteenth}} century, Beaumont, a catholic town, was {{surrounded}} by three protestant towns: Montauban, Mas-Grenier and Mauvezin.

25|$|Unlike <b>the</b> {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestants,</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Marian images, but in {{a different}} manner and with a different emphasis from the Catholic tradition. While statues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Mary abound in Catholic churches, there are specific prohibitions against all three-dimensional representations (of Mary or any other any saints) within the Orthodox Church, for they are regarded as remnants of pagan idolatry. Hence the Orthodox only produce and venerate two-dimensional images.|$|R
5|$|Jane Dudley (née Guildford), Duchess of Northumberland (1508/1509 – 1555) was an English noblewoman, {{the wife}} of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland and mother of Guildford Dudley and Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. Having grown up with her future husband, who was her father's ward, she married at about age 16. They had 13 children. Jane Dudley served as a lady-in-waiting at the court of Henry VIII and {{was a close friend}} of Queen Catherine Parr. Reformed in {{religious}} outlook, she was also a supporter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> martyr Anne Askew.|$|E
5|$|Recent historians, however, {{have taken}} a more {{complicated}} view of Elizabeth. Her reign is famous for {{the defeat of the}} Armada, and for successful raids against the Spanish, such as those on Cádiz in 1587 and 1596, but some historians point to military failures on land and at sea. In Ireland, Elizabeth's forces ultimately prevailed, but their tactics stain her record. Rather than as a brave defender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> nations against Spain and the Habsburgs, she is more often regarded as cautious in her foreign policies. She offered very limited aid to foreign Protestants and failed to provide her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.|$|E
5|$|Sunday was a {{conservative}} evangelical who accepted fundamentalist doctrines. He affirmed and preached the inerrancy of the Bible, the virgin birth of Christ, {{the doctrine of}} substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection of Christ, a literal devil and hell, and the imminent return of Jesus Christ. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, most Protestant church members, regardless of denomination, gave assent to these doctrines. Sunday refused to hold meetings in cities where he was not welcomed by the vast majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> churches and their clergy.|$|E
50|$|During the Thirty Years' War, the Vistula Lagoon was {{the main}} {{southern}} Baltic base of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, who was hailed as <b>the</b> protector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestants.</b> By 1660 <b>the</b> Vistula Lagoon had gone to Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia, but was returned in 1700.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> Edict <b>of</b> Nantes, Alès was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> places de sûreté {{given to}} the Huguenots.

5|$|The idea of {{the royal}} touch {{promoted}} {{the power of the}} monarchy, but the ceremony was seldom performed in the 16th century. During the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598), the worsening conditions helped scrofula spread more than ever and the interest in the disease steadily increased. The Catholic League started a propaganda claiming that Henry III (r. 1574–1589) was unable to heal by touch due to his immorality. After the assassination of Henry III and accession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protestant</b> Henry IV (r. 1589–1610), the League warned that God would revoke his gift if the French accepted a Protestant as their sovereign and that the scrofulous would never be cured again.|$|E
