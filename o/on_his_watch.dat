5|$|When Mauser enters, Chuck flashes <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> {{identifying}} {{him as a}} Fulcrum agent. Mauser tells Chuck that {{he knows}} that Casey and Sarah are CIA {{and that they are}} protecting an unknown asset. He reveals that Ned is a Fulcrum agent who caused the disturbance so Mauser could infiltrate the Buy More. At this point, it is revealed that Ned is far more competent than the hostages were led to believe, having intentionally shot Casey in the foot and separated Chuck from his handlers. Mauser threatens to shoot the hostages if Chuck does not reveal where Bryce Larkin and the government database the Intersect are. Chuck reveals to Mauser that the Intersect has been uploaded to his brain.|$|E
25|$|Investigations of the gunfight {{concluded}} {{that while it}} was Courtright who went for his pistol first, it was Short who ultimately outdrew and killed him. Courtright's inability to fire off a shot was due {{to a number of}} possible reasons; one was that his pistol got caught <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> chain for a second as he drew it, and another was that his pistol broke when one of Short's bullets struck it and his thumb.|$|E

2500|$|On May 31, 2003, Peter MacKay of Nova Scotia won the PC {{leadership}} election. Unlike Clark, MacKay supported open {{discussions on}} the concepts of a united party, but promised that, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> no full-fledged union would take place. Shortly after becoming leader, MacKay signalled his openness to broad [...] "talks" [...] with the Canadian Alliance with regard to creating more unity on the right.|$|E
2500|$|The Kansas City {{crime family}} had always enjoyed a violent reputation. [...] It started {{back to the}} turn of the 20th century when the Black Hand version of the Mafia terrorized the city's North Side. The {{violence}} had reached a peak during and immediately following the Lazia years(1928–1934), but things had remained relatively quiet under Carollo's rule. This would change under Binaggio as several unsolved mob slayings occurred <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{his role}} as an army commander, Rosecrans {{became one of the}} most popular generals in the Union Army. He was known to his men as [...] "Old Rosy", not only because of his last name (the source for that {{nickname}} at West Point), but because of his large red nose, which was described as [...] "intensified Roman". As a devout Catholic, he carried a crucifix <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> chain and a rosary in his pocket, and he delighted in keeping his staff up half the night debating religious doctrine. He could swing swiftly from bristling anger to good-natured amusement, which endeared him to his men.|$|E

2500|$|Brown {{was known}} for his shrewd and {{strategic}} use of the details of the planning process to affect and facilitate development projects <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> In regards to a parking garage on Vallejo Street desired by North Beach and Chinatown merchants, Brown circumvented neighborhood resident opponents of the garage by ordering demolition of the site's existing structure to commence on a Friday night and be done by Monday morning, when the group was certain to try to obtain a restraining order. [...] "It was with the demolition permit I outsmarted them," [...] Brown recounts proudly, claiming that as the critics rushed toward court, [...] "someone shouted out to them that the building had disappeared over the weekend. They've never recovered from that little maneuver." ...|$|E
2500|$|John O'Hara, in his 1960 novel Ourselves to Know, uses St. Anthony Hall {{membership}} in the characterizations of the protagonists: [...] "Did you join a fraternity at Penn?" [...] I said. [...] "Yes I did. [...] St Anthony-Delta Psi. [...] But I think they were sorry that they invited me..." [...] --- [...] "I happened to know, because I had seen it, {{that he had a}} Delta Psi Tea Company gold charm <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> chain, but the reason he did not show it was one of delicacy; in 1908 they had not accepted his resignation but he kept the insigne hidden..." [...] --- [...] "He and Robert quickly looked at each other's watch-chain and the Delta Psi charm and smiled. [...] "You know, I've been meaning to write you a letter..." [...] ("Tea" [...] Company was a then-used appellation referring to the fraternity's Tau Cross emblem.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015 The Forward said of J Street: [...] "There's {{no doubt}} that J Street has shaken up American Jewry. Since its {{inception}} in 2008 as a lobby, political action committee, educational group and student movement, the organization has disrupted the debate {{about what it means}} to be pro-Israel." [...] NPR's Mara Liasson reported from the J Street conference that took place shortly after Israel's March 17, 2015 elections, in which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised voters there would be no Palestinian state <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch.</b> Noting the American Jewish community was as divided as the Israeli voters, Liasson described J Street's role in American Jewish dialog on Israel: [...] "In the debate now raging in the Jewish community in the United States, J Street is the pro-two-state group and anti-Netanyahu, pro-nuclear-deal and generally much more supportive of Obama than AIPAC is." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 17, 2015, Netanyahu won {{a resounding}} victory in Israeli elections. His denial of a two state {{solution}} happening <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> and comments {{he made that}} are considered {{by some to be}} [...] "racist" [...] motivated J Street at its convention to make clear its opposition to the occupation, opposition to BDS, opposition to American Jewish support of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and to efforts by organizations like Hillel to limit the discussion on Israel and the peace process. Liberal Knesset Member Stav Shaffir encouraged J Street to hone the message of the pro-peace camp in Israel as well as the U.S., and she [...] "brought the crowd to its feet repeatedly as she described the battle ahead for a two-state solution". J Street followed Obama1's lead in considering international alternatives to direct negotiations between the Israeli government and Palestinians.|$|E
2500|$|Harold Katz {{bought the}} 76ers from Dixon in 1981. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> the final {{piece of the}} {{championship}} puzzle was completed before the 1982–83 season when they acquired center Moses Malone from the Houston Rockets. Led by Hall of Famer Julius Erving and All-Stars Maurice Cheeks, Andrew Toney, and Bobby Jones they dominated the regular season, winning 65 games in what is still the second most winning year in franchise history. Malone was named League MVP, and when reporters asked how the playoffs would run, he answered, [...] "four, four, four"—in other words, saying that the 76ers needed to win four games {{in each of the}} 3 rounds. The media misinterpreted this and assumed Moses was predicting that the 76ers would sweep all three rounds to win the title, with the minimum 12 games. Malone's accent made his boast sound like [...] "fo', fo', fo'." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Bure and {{his wife}} opened a Florida {{restaurant}} called [...] "The Milk and Honey Café", but closed the business when {{the family moved to}} California. They operate a Napa Valley, California winery, Bure Family Wines. Bure developed an interest in wine early in his NHL career that he described as growing into a passion: [...] "I {{fell in love with the}} behind-the-scenes work and being able to start from the vineyard and put it into a bottle. It's an amazing process." [...] Bure modified the Russian imperial seal <b>his</b> great-grandfather stamped <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>watches</b> to use as his company's label.|$|R

25|$|On 23 June 1916, Brussels was {{captured}} by the German torpedo boats G101 and G102. Fryatt was interned at Zeebrugge where he was arrested after engravings <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>watches</b> revealed <b>his</b> previous actions. Fryatt was tried and executed on 27 July 1916. Brussels {{was taken over by}} the Kaiserliche Marine and renamed Brugge, serving as a depôt ship at Zeebrugge. Her port of registry was nominally Berlin. On 23 April 1918, the Zeebrugge Raid took place, and the ship was torpedoed several times by the British, but did not sink. Brugge was scuttled by the Germans on 28 October 1918 when they evacuated Zeebrugge.|$|R

60|$|From {{that day}} on, Mr. Spugg, with his French medal <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> chain, {{was the most}} {{conspicuous}} figure in the club.
