25|$|Headphone size {{can affect}} the balance between {{fidelity}} and portability. Generally, headphone form factors {{can be divided into}} four separate categories: circumaural (<b>over-ear),</b> supra-aural (on-ear), earbud and in-ear.|$|E
2500|$|Circumaural {{headphones}} (sometimes called {{full size}} headphones or <b>over-ear</b> headphones) have circular or ellipsoid earpads that encompass the ears. Because these headphones completely surround the ear, circumaural headphones {{can be designed}} to fully seal against the head to attenuate external noise. Because of their size, circumaural headphones can be heavy {{and there are some}} sets that weigh over [...] Ergonomic headband and earpad design is required to reduce discomfort resulting from weight. These are commonly used by drummers in recording.|$|E

50|$|JLab Audio is an American {{consumer}} audio brand founded in 2005. The company began by making low-budget in-ear headphones, but has since {{expanded to include}} premium in-ear and <b>over-ear</b> headphones, as well as wireless headphones and Bluetooth speakers.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2012 the [...] "STREET by 50" [...] line of in-ear, <b>over-ear</b> and on-ear {{headphones}} were introduced. The wireless SYNC by 50 communicates using proprietary Kleer Wireless Technology, {{which claims}} to provide 16-bit CD quality sound with lossless audio, {{rather than the}} standard Bluetooth, and can connect to up to four devices within 50 feet.|$|E
5000|$|V-MODA began {{developing}} the M series in 2010 (for Modern audiophiles). 2011 saw {{the launch of}} the first M series on-ear headphones, the M-80, soon followed by the M-100 <b>over-ear</b> headphones. Around the same time, the company opened its Hong Kong office to handle logistics, manufacturing and sales for the Asia Pacific and Europe Regions. In 2013, Val Kolton moved to Milan and Munich to form V-MODA Milano S.r.l. design studios. V-MODA Milano creates and designs all the products and content for V-MODA worldwide subsidiaries.|$|E
50|$|In June 2012, Danquah {{released}} {{a line of}} consumer electronics. The Goji Electronics line consists of the brand of headphones, Goji Tinchy Stryder, the Goji On Cloud 9 Audio equipment, a circumaural headphone, an on-ear headphone, an in-ear headphone, a series of HD <b>over-ear</b> headphones, a supra-aural headphone, travel speakers, also consumer electronics such as tablet computer, netbook and smartphone accessories. The headphones are distributed by DSG International plc. DSG International and Danquah announced the deal in June 2012. The Goji Electronics consumer electronics and audio equipment, known as Goji Tinchy Stryder and Goji On Cloud 9, were available for sale mid-July 2012 and are distributed by DSG International plc subsidiaries across Europe and Pixmania globally.|$|E
30|$|ANC {{was first}} {{patented}} in 1934 by Paul Lueg, a German Physicist [13], and {{works on the}} principle of phase opposition; to any given sound, a sound cancellation speaker emits a sound wave of equal amplitude and inverted phase to ‘cancel out’ the emitted sound. This is employed by noise-cancelling headphones in a dynamic fashion to reduce the subjective experience of noise. ANC has been used widely in aviation for many years by pilots to reduce their exposure to noise emitted from engines [14]. Commercially available noise-cancelling devices are now inexpensive, widely available and exist as both <b>over-ear</b> headphones and in-ear earplugs. While this study used <b>over-ear</b> headphones, patients may better tolerate earplugs over longer periods of time, being physically less restrictive while using the same ANC technology.|$|E
30|$|We have {{described}} {{a model that}} permits {{for the first time}} quantification of the ability of headphones alone and headphones with ANC to reduce noise experienced in an ICU environment. We have demonstrated that the use of headphones with ANC technology can significantly reduce noise experienced throughout the day. The effect is additive to the reduction in noise exposure achieved by <b>over-ear</b> headphones alone and remains constant {{over the course of a}} 24 -h period. While the absolute mean reduction over 24  h of 6.8  dB between the NCHon group and our control appears modest, the decibel scale is logarithmic, and this corresponds to a marked reduction in sound energy exposure. Importantly, headphones with ANC also appear to reduce the number of ‘breaches’ of higher intensity sound events, suggesting there may be a ‘smoothing’ of the sound profile of the day as higher intensity sound events are suppressed.|$|E
