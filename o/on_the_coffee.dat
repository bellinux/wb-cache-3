5|$|In the United States, Rick had a {{temporary}} economic impact when, during its time off {{the shore of}} Chiapas and Oaxaca, it caused the price of coffee to rise 4.7 percent to $1.5685 per pound <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coffee,</b> Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the highest total it reached since October 16. Mexico is the United States's largest source of coffee imports and Oaxaca and Chiapas are the largest coffee growing regions in Mexico. Like the impact in El Tomatal, Rick's effects were much worse than Pauline's because Rick threatened the coffee crop when the beans were more susceptible to winds that could blow them off.|$|E

Varietals are generally known by the region {{in which they are}} grown, such as Colombian, Java and Kona.|$|R

The practical part analyzes Ethiopia's position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> global <b>coffee</b> market and further focuses on key factors that influence Ethiopia's market position. The position is evaluated in 4 selected spheres: supply, demand, price and regulation. In conclusion, it summarizes the identified shortcomings and offers measures for improvement...|$|R
50|$|It {{was during}} the {{governorship}} of Dejazmach Ganame that <b>the</b> cultivation of <b>coffee</b> was further developed in Illubabor. Coffee {{became one of the}} most important trade items exported through Gambela to the Sudan. Traditionally, the Oromo cultivators were made to pay taxes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> amount of <b>coffee</b> they have actually picked from the trees and were permitted to retain those fallen <b>coffee</b> beans <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. In 1914 when Dejazmach Ganame started collecting taxes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fallen <b>coffee</b> beans, <b>the</b> peasants protested against the new tax burdens. They sent a delegation to Addis Ababa to appeal the case to Ras Tafari (the future Emperor Haile Selassie.

2500|$|A twelve-person jury {{reached its}} verdict on August 18, 1994. [...] Applying the {{principles}} of comparative negligence, the jury found that McDonald's was 80% responsible for the incident and Liebeck was 20% at fault. Though there was a warning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> cup, the jury decided that the warning was neither large enough nor sufficient. They awarded Liebeck $200,000 in compensatory damages, which was then reduced by 20% to $160,000. In addition, they awarded her $2.7 million in punitive damages. The jurors apparently arrived at this figure from Morgan's suggestion to penalize McDonald's {{for one or two}} days' worth of coffee revenues, which were about $1.35 million per day. The judge reduced punitive damages to $480,000, three times the compensatory amount, for a total of $640,000. The decision was appealed by both McDonald's and Liebeck in December 1994, but the parties settled out of court for an undisclosed amount less than $600,000.|$|E

Well, I open the letter and it's from President Clinton inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, do you have any idea how big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between {{the end of}} the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, coffee was the main export product of Brazil. At first, Brazilian farmers used African slave labour in the coffee plantations, but in 1850, the slave traffic was {{abolished}} in Brazil. To solve the labour shortage, the Brazilian elite decided to attract European immigrants to work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> plantations. This also supported the government's push toward [...] "whitening" [...] the country. The hope was that through procreation that the large African and Native American groups would be eliminated or reduced. The government and farmers offered to pay European immigrants' passage. The plan encouraged millions of Europeans, most of them Italians, to migrate to Brazil. However, once in Brazil, the immigrants received very low salaries and worked in poor conditions, including long working hours and frequent ill-treatment by their bosses. Because of this, in 1902, Italy enacted Decree Prinetti, prohibiting subsidized immigration to Brazil.|$|E

[...] "…by gathering around ourselves treasured objects from different times {{of our lives and}} our histories, we experience different eras at the same moment and in some way bring the totality of the past to bear upon the present." [...] The family history and identity is preserved and transmitted, both for the family member who walks past the bowl sitting on the counter, and the outsider who asks about the origin of the unique item.

Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn't remember when it was or where.
