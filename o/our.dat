As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help <b>our</b> case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E

Several years later, after {{a handful}} of {{setbacks}} and personal conflicts, Jimmy Gnecco was signed as a solo artist to DreamWorks Records in 1997 under the moniker of <b>Ours.</b> <b>Ours</b> have released four official albums to date: Ballet the Boxer 1 (Ballet the Boxer 1) (2013) Mercy (Dancing for the Death of an Imaginary Enemy) (2008), Precious (2002), and their label debut Distorted Lullabies (2001).|$|R

5|$|Lord God, {{the resurrection}} and life {{of all who}} believe in thee, who art always worthy to be praised by both {{the living and the}} dead, we give thee thanks for Edward the Second, <b>our</b> Founder, for Adam de Brome, <b>our</b> {{principal}} benefactor and for all <b>our</b> other benefactors, by whose benefits we are here maintained in godliness and learning; and we beseech thee that using these thy gifts rightly we may be led to the immortal glory of resurrection, through Jesus Christ <b>our</b> Lord.|$|E

The ACLU's National Security Project advocates for national security policies that are consistent with the Constitution, the rule of law, and fundamental human rights. The Project litigates cases relating to detention, torture, discrimination, surveillance, censorship, and secrecy.|$|E

5|$|Thus <b>our</b> {{actions are}} predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains <b>our</b> own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent. <b>Our</b> actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of <b>our</b> wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in <b>our</b> power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from <b>our</b> will is <b>our</b> own, no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E

25|$|We {{know that}} <b>our</b> {{consciousness}} inhabits a physical body, {{similar to other}} physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet <b>our</b> consciousness is not commensurate with <b>our</b> body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually {{are not aware of}} the breathing of <b>our</b> lungs or the beating of <b>our</b> heart unless somehow <b>our</b> attention is called to them. <b>Our</b> ability to control either is limited. <b>Our</b> kidneys command <b>our</b> attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us have any idea what <b>our</b> liver is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.|$|E

25|$|These studies {{point to}} the fact that even though we only attend to and process limited information, we have a vast amount of {{knowledge}} at <b>our</b> disposal through <b>our</b> highly unrestricted sensory registers. It is the selective attention, perception, and higher order cognitive processing that limits these inputs and it is precisely these processes that make up <b>our</b> conscious awareness. Thus, in order to formulate some explanations for Plato's Problem, <b>our</b> conscious awareness limits <b>our</b> experience; nevertheless, it seems as though some stimuli that are sensed by <b>our</b> sensory registers, although seemingly rejected by conscious awareness, are actually retained and abstracted into <b>our</b> memories for further processing. All of <b>our</b> fully functioning perceptual faculties enhance, supplement, and optimize <b>our</b> experiences.|$|E
