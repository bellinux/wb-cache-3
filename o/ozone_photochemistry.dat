NO 2 data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) show enhancements, suggesting lightning production of NO x. At 15 : 05 UTC, an ozonesonde ascended into the southern edge of the now dissipating convective cell as it moved west across the Azuero Peninsula.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{research done}} under NASA Grant NAG 5 - 4653. The research performed under this grant {{has been a}} collaboration between institutions including the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the University of Oregon, and the NASA Langley Research Center. The program has included fully line-resolved measurements of submillimeter and far infrared spectroscopic line parameters (pressure broadening coefficients and their temperature dependences, and line positions) {{for the analysis of}} field measurements of stratospheric constituents, far infrared database improvements, and studies for improved satellite measurements of the Earth's atmosphere. This research program is designed to enable the full utilization of spectra obtained in far infrared/submillimeter field measurements, such as FIRS- 2, FILOS, IBEX, SLS, EosMLS, and proposed European Space Agency measurements of OH (e. g., PIRAMHYD and SFINX) for the retrieval of accurate stratospheric altitude profiles of key trace gases involved in <b>ozone</b> layer <b>photochemistry.</b> For the analysis of the spectra obtained in the stratosphere from far infrared measurements it is necessary to have accurate values of the molecular parameters (line positions, strengths, and pressure broadening coefficients) for the measured molecules and for possible interfering species. Knowledge of line positions is in increasingly good shape, with some notable exceptions. The increase in position information includes research that has been performed in the present program of research on HO 2, H 2 O, H 2 O 2, O 3, HCl, HF, HBr, HI, CO, OH, and ClO. Examples where further line position studies are necessary include hot band and minor isotopomer lines of some of the major trace species (H 2 O, O 3) and normal lines of some triatomic and larger molecules (NO 2). Knowledge of strengths is in generally good shape, since most of the lines are from electric dipole transitions whose intensities are well determined from Stark effect measurements; exceptions include some molecules with large vibration-rotation interactions (NO 2) and internal motions (H 2 O 2 above the lowest torsional state). The line parameters that are still the least well determined are pressure broadening coefficients, and their temperature coefficients, These are strongly dependent on the quantum states involved in the transitions, {{in a way that is}} much more complex than the simple projection by directional cosine matrix elements involved in determination of rotational line strengths from static dipole moments. The following molecules have now been measured or detected in the atmosphere using far infrared and millimeter-wave emission spectroscopy from balloon- and satellite-borne spectrometers: OH, HO 2, H 2 O (including minor isotopomers and hot band lines), H 2 O 2, O 3 P, O 2 (including minor isotopomers), O 3 (including minor isotopomers and hot band lines), HOCl, HCl, HF, HBr, CIO, CO, CO 2, N 2 O, NO 2, N 2 O 5, HNO 3, ClNO 3, and HCN. Many of these species have spectral lines that are saturated in stratospheric spectra. In these cases, the measured line equivalent widths are proportional to (line strength x Lorentz width) (exp 1 / 2) so that the pressure broadening coefficients are as important as the line intensities in determining concentration profiles. Interpretation of field measurements for these species have required ongoing measurement programs of pressure broadening measurements. Other species (HO 2, HGCl, H 2 O 2, HBr, and NO 2, as examples) have required further line position studies in order to fully analyze the field measurements...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of <b>ozone</b> (O 3) <b>photochemistry</b> observed by aircraft measurements of boreal biomass burning plumes over eastern Canada {{in the summer of}} 2011. Measurements of O 3 and a number of key chemical species associated with O 3 photochemistry, including non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), nitrogen oxides (NO x) and total nitrogen containing species (NO y), were made from the UK FAAM BAe- 146 research aircraft as part of the "quantifying the impact of BOReal forest fires on Tropospheric oxidants over the Atlantic using Aircraft and Satellites" (BORTAS) experiment between 12 July and 3 August 2011. The location and timing of the aircraft measurements put BORTAS into a unique position to sample biomass burning plumes from the same source region in Northwestern Ontario with a range of ages. We found that O 3 mixing ratios measured in biomass burning plumes were indistinguishable from non-plume measurements, but evaluating them in relationship to measurements of carbon monoxide (CO), total alkyl nitrates (ΣAN) and the surrogate species NO z (= NO y -NO x) revealed that the potential for O 3 production increased with plume age. We used NMHC ratios to estimate photochemical ages of the observed biomass burning plumes between 0 and 10 days. The BORTAS measurements provided a wide dynamic range of O 3 production in the sampled biomass burning plumes with ΔO 3 /ΔCO enhancement ratios increasing from 0. 020 ± 0. 008 ppbv ppbv − 1 in plumes with photochemical ages less than 2 days to 0. 55 ± 0. 29 ppbv ppbv − 1 in plumes with photochemical ages greater than 5 days. We found that the main contributing factor to the variability in the ΔO 3 /ΔCO enhancement ratio was ΔCO in plumes with photochemical ages less than 4 days, and that was a transition to ΔO 3 becoming the main contributing factor in plumes with ages greater than 4 days. In comparing O 3 mixing ratios with components of the NO y budget, we observed that plumes with ages between 2 and 4 days were characterised by high aerosol loading, relative humidity greater than 40 %, and low ozone production efficiency (OPE) of 7. 7 ± 3. 5 ppbv ppbv − 1 relative to ΣAN and 1. 6 ± 0. 9 ppbv ppbv − 1 relative to NO z. In plumes with ages greater than 4 days, OPE increased to 472 ± 28 ppbv ppbv − 1 relative to ΣAN and 155 ± 5 ppbv ppbv − 1 relative to NO z. From the BORTAS measurements we estimated that aged plumes with low aerosol loading were close to being in photostationary steady state and O 3 production in younger plumes was inhibited by high aerosol loading and greater production of ΣAN relative to O 3. The BORTAS measurements of O 3 photochemistry in boreal biomass burning plumes were found to be consistent with previous summertime aircraft measurements made over the same region during the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere (ARCTAS-B) in 2008 and Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiment (ABLE 3 B) in 1990...|$|R
40|$|Tropospheric ozone, one of {{the most}} {{important}} green-house gases and {{one of the}} most essential components of photochemical smog, has been monitored from space by different retrieval techniques since the late 1980 s. Satellite measurements are well suitable to investigate sources and transport mechanisms of tropospheric ozone, as well as its atmospheric chemistry on regional and global scales. Nevertheless, the retrieval of tropospheric ozone columns (TOCs) from satellite data constitutes a big challenge since approximately 90 % of the total ozone amount is located in the stratosphere, and only the remaining 10 % is located in the troposphere. The Limb-Nadir Matching technique is one of the methods that has been widely used to re-trieve TOCs from space borne measurements. In previous studies, this approach has been applied to measurements from the SCIAMACHY instrument, which alternates limb and nadir geometry. An accurate tropopause height, retrieved from the ECMWF database, was used to subtract the stratospheric ozone column from the total ozone column. In this thesis, a three-step approach is shown that was developed to improve the current Limb-Nadir Matching TOC retrieval technique, and resulted in the new database version 1. 2. Several improvements in the V 1. 2 TOC data have been achieved. The obtained amount of TOC V 1. 2 data has increased by a factor of two in comparison to the original dataset. Fur-thermore, the data quality has improved in many aspects. First of all, the V 1. 2 TOC data set reduces the negative (> 10 DU) and positive (~ 10 DU) biases over tropics and high latitudes, respectively. The reduction is achieved by use of the improved limb ozone data set V 3. 0, which was tested and validated against the previous version V 2. 9 in this thesis. The TOC values were also optimized over the midlatitudes by decreasing its positive biases. The yearly averaged V 1. 2 TOC data set agrees well with ozonesonde measurements within 5 DU globally. More details on the TOC distribution were successfully captured because of the improved accuracy of the data. The clear observation of the spring TOC maxima (~ 42 DU) over the Arabian Sea (AS) during the pre-monsoon is one of the benefits of using the V 1. 2 TOC product. In the present thesis, the potential sources of the AS spring ozone pool are investigated by use of multiple data sets (e. g., SCIAMACHY Limb-Nadir-Matching TOC, OMI/MLS TOC, TES TOC, MACC reanalysis data, MOZART- 4 model and HYSPLIT model). 3 / 4 of the enhanced ozone concentrations are attributed to the 0 - 8 km height range. The main source of the ozone enhancement is considered to be caused by long range transport of pollutants from India (~ 50 % contributions to the lowest 4 km, ~ 20 % contributions to the 4 - 8 km height range), the Middle East, Africa and Europe (~ 30 % in total). In addition, the vertical pollution accumulation in the lower troposphere, especially at 4 - 8 km, was found to be important for the AS spring <b>ozone</b> pool. Local <b>photochemistry,</b> on the other hand, plays a negligible role in producing ozone at the 4 - 8 km height range. In the 0 - 4 km height range, ozone is quickly removed by wet-deposition. The AS spring TOC maxima are influenced by the dynamical variations caused by the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly during the El Nino period in 2005 and 2010 with a ~ 5 DU decrease. The Limb-Nadir Matching retrieval improvement scheme developed in this thesis leads to a much more accurate TOC product measured by SCIAMACHY and a better understanding of tropospheric ozone distributions...|$|R

Equilibrium calculations are then used to show that hydrogen reactions are important for ozone and temperature distributions primarily above 40 km while nitrogen reactions are important primarily below 50 km. Comparisons with observed distributions of temperature and ozone suggest the need for water vapor mixing ratios of from 1 - 5 X 10 - 6 and mixing ratios of (NO 2 +NO) of from 3 - 10 XlO- * at the stratopause. At 35 km, a mixing ratio of (NOz+NO) of about 3 X is indicated.

For cool M 5 –M 7 stars, the stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>photochemistry</b> was completely smog-dominated.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in observational techniques are examined, {{taking into account}} a review of some unresolved problems in the measurement/estimation of total ozone and the vertical ozone profile, the sensitivity of Dobson total ozone estimations to wavelength band calibration uncertainties, errors in Dobson total measurements arising from aerosol attenuation, and optical stop and focussing effects in the Dobson instrument. Other subjects considered are related to total ozone observations, tropospheric ozone, upper air ozone observations, observations of trace gases in the atmosphere, <b>ozone</b> <b>photochemistry</b> and directly related photochemical models, the interaction of ozone and atmospheric circulation, ozone effects on climate, and solar activity and ozone variations. Programs and recommendations involving ozone theory and observations are also discussed, giving attention to current problems of ozone chemistry, the upper atmosphere research satellite program, a French contribution to ozone related studies, and ozone and the middle atmosphere program...|$|E
30|$|Grenfell et al. (2013) used a global-mean radiative-convective-photochemical column {{model to}} perform a {{sensitivity}} study on the atmosphere of an Earth-like planet. The stellar class and planetary gravity of the planet was varied {{and the effects of}} the resulting photochemistry and climate changes investigated. According to their results, the stratospheric ozone generation of an Earth-like planet orbiting an M 0 star is still dominated by the Chapman cycle but to a lesser extent compared to the Earth and the smog generation mechanism is strengthened. The Chapman cycle is a set of chemical and photochemical reactions responsible for the formation and destruction of ozone that involves only oxygen reactions. Moving towards cooler stars, the Chapman mechanism is weakened and the smog mechanisms is strengthened. For cool M 5 -M 7 stars, the <b>ozone</b> <b>photochemistry</b> shifted completely from the Chapman production to smog-dominated stratospheric ozone production.|$|E
40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} emission control and urbanization, with its concomitant intensification {{of the urban}} heat island, on urban ozone concentrations are studied. The effect of temperature on ozone is considered, and attention {{is given to the}} temperature effect on <b>ozone</b> <b>photochemistry.</b> Model calculations suggest that ozone concentration enhancements are caused by the effect of temperature on the atmospheric chemistry of peroxyacetyl nitrate, as well as the temperature dependence of natural and anthropogenic hydrocarbon emissions. It is pointed out that, because of the sensitivity of urban ozone to local climatic conditions and the ability of trees to moderate summertime temperatures, the inadvertent removal of trees from urbanization can have an adverse effect on urban ozone concentration, while a temperature increase in the urban heat island caused by urbanization can essentially cancel out the ozone-reducing benefits obtained from a 50 -percent reduction in anthropogenic hydrocarbon emissions...|$|E
40|$|A {{program of}} {{research}} studies {{related to the}} photochemistry, radiative transfer, and dynamics of the stratosphere is described. Investigations were conducted in two broad areas: (1) studies of the stratospheric processes and their response to external perturbations, and (2) analysis of satellite measurements in conjunction with theoretical models. Contemporary one dimensional photochemical, radiative-convective model {{was used to assess}} the impact of perturbations such as solar flux variability, increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide, chlorofluoromethanes and other greenhouse gases. Data from satellite experiments such as LIMS and SBUV, were used along with theoretical models to develop a climatology of trace species in the stratosphere. The consistency of contemporary <b>ozone</b> <b>photochemistry</b> was examined in the light of LIMS data. Research work also includes analysis of stratospheric nitrogen dioxide distributions from different satellite experiments, investigation of the wintertime latitudinal gradients in NO 2, estimation of the stratospheric odd nitrogen level and its variability, and studies related to the changes in ozone in the Antarctic, and mid latitude Southern Hemisphere...|$|E
40|$|In this {{communication}} {{we present}} some approaches {{to relate the}} depletion process with the solar activity. We propose to study the effectiveness of ozone layer structure. Developing a quantitative treatment for data covering a specific period, this study will report for Pakistan an explorative assessment {{of the link between}} ozone layer depletion and solar activity. We have computed parameters, which signify the measurements drawn from the satellite, and ground based instruments. We will also try to look for understanding the interaction of dynamics and <b>ozone</b> <b>photochemistry</b> in the middle atmosphere (25 - 35 km) and the nature of stratospheric responses to anomalous solar activity. We have compared both the data sets using different techniques and observed that the trend follows the same path. This could be helpful in obtaining the estimates of sunspots and establishing a correlation with the ozone layer reduction then suitable predictions can be made for our government and private department...|$|E
40|$|The {{similarity}} {{relationship for}} {{maximum ozone concentration}} {{as a function of}} initial precursor concentrations developed in the first article of this 2 -part series exhibits a scale break, most easily seen after a Weibull transformation, which identifies a characteristic scale for <b>ozone</b> <b>photochemistry.</b> In this paper, we investigate the similarity relationship using simple semi-quantitative models and model output. From this investigation, we develop a set of properties characterizing ozone-precursor relationships. We find the scaling break is associated with a change in the temporal variability of ozone production. Finally, we examine a series of smog chamber experiments for evidence of a scaling break. We find the data support a slight break after suitable transformation. It is difficult to tell if the lack of distinct break is due to smog chamber experimental limitations, a bias in the test conditions or if the processes leading to the scaling break are overly enhanced by chemical mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} various hypotheses {{that have}} been advanced as possible explanations of the ozone weekend effect. These hypotheses are not necessarily complete solutions; each might account for all, for part, or for none of the observed differences in measured ozone on weekdays versus weekends. Explaining the weekend effect {{is not a simple}} task because ozone formation, transport, and destruction in the lower atmosphere is a highly complex process. It is not surprising, therefore, that multiple hypotheses have been proposed concerning the cause(s) of the ozone weekend effect. Seven hypotheses are considered here. The hypotheses address temporal, spatial, and compositional changes in emissions from weekdays to weekends and how these changes might interact with meteorological and photochemical processes to produce the observed weekday to weekend differences in ozone concentrations. The seven hypotheses are: 1. NOX reduction: more ozone is formed on weekends because urban areas of California are "VOC-limited " and proportionately lower NOX emissions on weekends increase the VOC/NOX ratio; nonlinear <b>ozone</b> <b>photochemistry</b> the...|$|E
