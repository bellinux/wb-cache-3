40|$|A tree {{transducer}} with <b>origin</b> translates {{an input}} tree {{into a pair}} of output tree and <b>origin</b> info. The <b>origin</b> info maps each node in the output tree to the unique input node that created it. In this way, the implementation of the transducer becomes part of its semantics. We show that the landscape of decidable properties changes drastically when <b>origin</b> info is added. For instance, equivalence of nondeterministic top-down and MSO transducers with <b>origin</b> is decidable. Both problems are undecidable without <b>origin.</b> The equivalence of deterministic topdown tree-to-string transducers is decidable with <b>origin,</b> while without <b>origin</b> it is a long standing open problem. With <b>origin,</b> we can decide if a deterministic macro tree transducer can be realized by a deterministic top-down tree transducer; without <b>origin</b> this is an open problem. ICALP' 15.

5|$|<b>Origins</b> was {{developed}} by the United Kingdom branch of Climax Studios, after it was transferred from the United States branch, who faced issues with the game engine and the vision of the game; the script, monsters, and level design were redone, and aspects of <b>Origins</b> atmosphere and gameplay intentionally replicated those of the first Silent Hill game. <b>Origins</b> was generally positively reviewed, although some reviewers wrote that it followed the formula of the series too closely and failed to add anything new. Its PlayStation 2 port received a lower aggregate score, with criticism directed towards its visuals.|$|E

40|$|The {{differences}} in occupational gender-typing between French students of Maghrebi <b>origin,</b> French students of European <b>origin,</b> and French older adults of European <b>origin</b> were examined. The students of Maghrebi <b>origin</b> demonstrated {{a higher level}} of occupational gender-typing than the students of European <b>origin</b> or the older adults but the difference in gender-typing was not considerable and the linear association between mean ratings was impressive. In addition, the students of Maghrebi <b>origin</b> demonstrated an equivalent level of occupational gender-typing than the one found just ten years ago among French students of European <b>origin.</b> These results are consistent with previous findings showing that integrationism and individualism were the preferred acculturation orientations among persons of Maghrebi <b>origin</b> living in France. </span...|$|R
