25|$|China–Pakistan {{relations}} {{began in}} 1950 when Pakistan {{was among the}} first countries to end official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China or Taiwan and recognize the PRC. Since then, both countries have placed considerable importance on the maintenance of an extremely close and supportive relationship and the two countries have regularly exchanged high-level visits resulting in a variety of agreements. The PRC has provided economic, military and technical assistance to Pakistan and each considers the other a close strategic ally. The relationship has recently been the subject of renewed attention due to the publication <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> , which is the first extensive treatment of the relationship since the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, King {{released}} the second installment, , in which Roland draws three people from 20th-century United States into his world through magical doors. Grant published The Drawing of the Three, with illustrations by Phil Hale, {{in a slightly}} larger run of 30,000 copies, which was still well below King's typical initial hardcover print run <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book.</b> It, published in 1986, had an initial print run of 1,000,000 copies, King's largest to date. King had believed that the Dark Tower books would {{be of interest to}} only a select group of his fans, and had resisted releasing them on a larger scale. Finally, in the late 1980s, bowing to pressure from his publishers and fans who were searching for the books (at this point fewer than 50,000 of his millions of readers {{would have been able to}} own any of the Dark Tower books), King agreed to release The Gunslinger and all subsequent Dark Tower books in trade paperback and mass-market formats.|$|E

25|$|With the Restoration of {{the monarchy}} in 1660, Charles II made the court once more the centre of musical {{patronage}} in Britain, the theatres were reopened and, after the introduction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>Book</b> of Common Prayer in 1662, choral music began to be developed again. The king's time on the continent, his (hidden) preference for Catholicism and explicit desire for entertainment led to the embracing of the Baroque and continental forms of music. The court became something of a crossroads of European musicians and styles on a much grander scale than previously achieved. It was probably in these circumstances that Welsh musicians at the court encountered the Italian triple harp, which they adopted and which {{by the end of}} the century had supplanted simpler harps to become a national Welsh symbol. As well as encouraging many French musicians to join his court, the king dispatched the young Pelham Humfrey (1647–74) to study in Paris, probably in 1665. When he returned he became the Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal and composer to the Court. Although he died aged only 27 he was highly influential on other English composers like William Turner (1651–1740), John Blow (1649–1708) and Henry Purcell (1659–95). Early in his career Purcell wrote secular music, including for the theatre. Later, as organist of Westminster Abbey and the Chapel Royal, he devoted himself to sacred music. In both fields he emerged as the most influential British composer of the era.|$|E

2500|$|In Gary Posner's 1999 interview, Klass {{explained}} {{his views on}} UFOs: [...] "As I turn 80, my fondest hope is that a genuine ET craft will land on our back patio and that I will be abducted.

Of course, I would have to pay Stanton Friedman $10,000 — based on my long-standing wager that UFOs will never be proven real — but I would expect to become wealthy from the royalties <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> titled Why Me, ET?. And instead of spending many hours each week 'debunking' UFOs, I'll finally have time to watch some TV, go to the movies, and perhaps get to read a few non-UFO books for enjoyment." ...|$|E

He was speaking ahead of the publication <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> Hope for the World: To Unite All Things in Christ. In the book, Burke says: [...] "Islam is a religion that, according to its own interpretation, must also become the State.

2500|$|Russell had {{originally}} {{written about the}} case, arguing that Sacco and Vanzetti were innocent, but further research led him to write a 1962 book, asserting that Sacco was guilty. Russell used the Gambera revelation as the basis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> in 1986, in which he claims that the case is [...] "solved." [...] He presented his view that Sacco {{was one of the}} shooters, while Vanzetti was an accessory after the fact. While Russell's 1962 book was praised, even by those who disagreed with his conclusion, for being balanced and well-reasoned, his 1986 book was much more negatively received. In the latter, the [...] "accessory after the fact" [...] legal theory is incorrect: Massachusetts law, now and {{at the time of the}} crime, allowed both men to be charged as joint principals in a robbery-homicide, for which they were convicted. From a legal standpoint, it does not matter how many shots, or even if, Vanzetti fired, to establish his legal culpability for the robbery and murders.|$|E
2500|$|At 17:30 of {{the same}} day, Grandi went to Palazzo Venezia; the {{official}} reason was the presentation to Mussolini <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> about the Italian participation in the non-intervention committee in Spain. The meeting was scheduled to last 15 minutes, {{but at the end}} it was prolonged until 18:45. Waiting to be received by the Duce were the Chief of Police and the German Feldmarschall Kesselring. In his memoirs written one year later, Mussolini denied that he spoke with Grandi about the OdG, but this is not credible. It is apparent that Grandi, who loved the Duce, explained to him the consequences of his OdG, giving him a last chance to save face and resign before the vote. In that case, the Grand Council’s meeting would have been superfluous. Mussolini listened while Grandi was explaining the necessity to resign to avoid a catastrophe, but at the end rebuked him saying that his conclusions were wrong, since Germany was about to produce a decisive secret weapon. After that, Mussolini met Kesselring and the Chief of Police, Chierici: to the latter he confided {{that it would have been}} easy to bring Grandi, Bottai and Ciano back to the fold, as they were eager to be persuaded by him. On the morning of 23 July Mussolini accepted the resignation of Cini: this was supposed to be a signal to his opponents. At the same time, at Federzoni's home, Grandi, Federzoni, de Marsico (one of the best jurists in Italy), Bottai and Ciano modified the OdG, removing the interpretative introduction which explained the functions of the Grand Council. Here they demonstrated that the assembly had the constitutional power to remove Mussolini. In fact, according to the constitutionalists, the [...] "Leggi Fascistissime" [...] of December 1925 bent the Constitution, but did not break it. Because of these laws, the Duce ruled the country on behalf of the King, who remained always the source of the executive power. Because of that, if the Grand Council, which was the trait d'union between Fascism and the state, passed a vote of no confidence on the dictator, the King would have been entitled to remove him and nominate his successor. In that occasion Ciano was acquainted with the OdG by Bottai: Grandi was reluctant to accept him, since he was the son-in-law of Mussolini and was known for his superficial and inconstant character, but Ciano insisted, unaware that this decision would have provoked his death six months later in Verona. After that, Grandi had as a guest at his office in the parliament Farinacci, showing him his OdG. Farinacci told Grandi that he accepted the first part of the document, but that he did not agree at all on the rest: the military powers had to be given to the Germans, and Italy should start to fight the war seriously, getting rid of Mussolini and the generals. At the end he, like Scorza, asked him for a copy of his OdG, and like Scorza he used it to produce another OdG of his own. In the time left before the meeting, Grandi contacted other participants asking them to join his action.|$|E
