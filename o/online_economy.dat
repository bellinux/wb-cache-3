40|$|Intelligent agents called pricebots {{provide a}} convienient {{mechanism}} for implementing automated dynamic pricing algorithms for sellers in an <b>online</b> <b>economy.</b> Pricebots enable an online seller to dynamically calculate a competitive {{price for a}} product in response to variations in market parameters such as competitors ’ prices and consumers’ purchase preferences. Previous research on pricebot mediated pricing makes certain simplifying assumptions of online markets such as providing sellers with complete knowledge of market parameters to facililate calculations by the dynamic pricing algorithm, and, considering product price as the only attribute that determines consumers ’ purchase decision. In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} dynamic pricing in a competitive <b>online</b> <b>economy</b> where a product is differentiated by buyers and sellers on multiple attributes, and, sellers possess limited knowledge about market parameters. A seller uses a collaborative filtering algorithm to determine temporal consumers ’ purchase preferences followed by a dynamic pricing algorithm to determine a competitive price for the product. Simulation results using our market model show that collaborative filtering enabled dynamic pricing techniques compare favorably against other dynamic pricing algorithms. Collaborative filtering enables sellers to rapidly identify temporal customer preferences and improve sellers ’ profits...|$|E

50|$|In Who Owns the Future?, Jaron Lanier {{posits that}} {{the middle class is}} {{increasingly}} disenfranchised from <b>online</b> <b>economies.</b> By convincing users to give away valuable information about themselves in exchange for free services, firms can accrue large amounts of data at virtually no cost. Lanier calls these firms “Siren Servers,” alluding to the Sirens of Ulysses. Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool, the Siren Servers concentrate wealth {{in the hands of the}} few who control the data centers. For example, he points to Google's translation algorithm, which amalgamates previous translations uploaded by people online, giving the user its best guess. The people behind the source translations receive no payment for their work, while Google profits from increased ad visibility as a powerful Siren Server. As a solution to this problem, Lanier puts forth an alternative structure to the web based on Ted Nelson’s Project Xanadu. He proposes a two-way linking system that would point to the source of any piece of information, creating an economy of micropayments that compensates people for original material they post to the web.|$|R

40|$|The {{critical}} {{literature on}} commercial monitoring and so-called ‘free labour’ (Terranova 2000) locates exploitation in realms beyond the workplace proper, noting {{the productivity of}} networked activity including the creation of user-generated-content and the profitability of commercial sites for social networking and communication. The changing context of productivity in these realms, however, requires further development of a critical concept of exploitation. This article defines exploitation as the extraction of unpaid, coerced, and alienated labour. It considers how such a definition might apply to various forms of unpaid but profit-generating online activity, arguing that commercial monitoring redoubles the conscious, intentional activity of users in ways that render it amenable to a critique of exploitation.

40|$|In the {{expanding}} field of communication, Facebook holds a dubious position as both friend and foe. Hailed for its connectivity and its par-ticipatory potential, {{it is equally}} criticized for its egocentric exhibition-ism and its voyeuristic gaze. And yet, Facebook currently boasts over one billion users who friend, share, like, poke, tag, message, creep, and stalk one an-other (Facebook, 2013 a). Facebook’s mission is simple: to give people “the power to share and make the world more open and connected ” (Facebook, 2013 b). Anyone can join Facebook. Anyone can be a watcher and/or be watched. The promise of “power” has transformed Facebook into a multimodal platform of surveillance, which blends interpersonal, institutional, aggregate, and investigative practices. In his text Social Media as Surveillance: Rethinking Visibility in a Converging World, Daniel Trottier con-siders this complex and conflicted terrain and analyzes the “mutual augmentation” of surveillance practices across user groups (p. 11).

40|$|Surveillance-based reality {{television}} {{has emerged as}} a resurgent programming genre in the US and Western Europe during a time when the <b>online</b> <b>economy</b> is becoming increasingly reliant upon surveillance as a form of economic exploitation. The portrayal of surveillance through ‘reality TV ’ as a form of entertainment and self-expression can thus be understood as playing an important role in training viewers and consumers for their role in an ‘interactive ’ economy. This article relies on interviews with cast members and producers of MTV’s popular reality show ‘Road Rules’, to explore the form of subjectivity that corresponds to its implicit definition of ‘reality’. This form of subjectivity reinforces the promise of the interactive economy to democratize production by relinquishing control to consumers and viewers. Surveillance is portrayed not as a form of social control, but as the democratization of celebrity – a fact that has disturbing implications for the democratic potential of the internet’s interactive capability.

However, backup technologies have not kept up with this trend.

In comparison to disks, tape technologies are still comparatively slow and the media tends to deteriorate over time. Additionally, there are the future hardware compatibility issues of trying to match a degraded tape to a working tape drive, not to mention the physical issues such as offline labeling and storage.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{compilation}} thesis consisting of an introduction and five separate articles. It explores the process of internationalization for Online Services Providers (OSPs) {{and its effect on}} the economic geography in terms of production and users of online services. OSPs are firms that provide services through the Internet. This type of firm is becoming increasingly important in the economy, and is claimed {{to be one of the}} building blocks of an emerging <b>online</b> <b>economy.</b> The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the theory of how OSPs internationalize and to extend the knowledge of the places where online services are produced and used. The thesis emphasizes the importance of the balance between a firm’s offline commitments vis-à-vis its online commitments in the internationalization process. It has been argued that the variances in the way OSPs internationalize are an effect of their “onlineness”. Onlineness is defined as the dependence on offline resources for the OSPs’ service and business model. An OSP with a high degree of onlineness could enjoy a rapid and geographically vast internationalization process, referred to as ‘online spatial overreach’ in the thesis. Although such a pattern could have positive effects in terms of reduced time to market, it could also backfire, leaving the OSP in a situation without any real contact with the international market. The findings show that OSPs internationalize through controlled modes of entry, but are sometimes combined with viral marketing and codevelopment. In general, OSPs internationalize faster in comparison to traditional export firms. The OSPs from Sweden and Morocco studied in the thesis primarily expand regionally. For OSPs originating from the Global North, this means that existing geographical trade routes are reinforced, but for OSPs in the Global South the regional internationalization pattern could strengthen the heretofore underdeveloped intra-regional trade, for example in Africa. From a geographical perspective, the main conclusion is that the internationalization of OSPs contributes to the heterogeneity of the <b>online</b> <b>economy,</b> mainly due to underpinning economic inequalities. OSPs are dependent on offline resources, which in turn are anchored in geographically bound and sticky networks. This heterogeneity is manifested by a maintained, or even increasing, digital divide, which can be seen as a contingency of economic inequality. In the close future, unless radical changes are made in Internet policy, we can expect further online gaps to emerge on the usage side (online usage gap), on the production side (online entrepreneurship gap), and also in terms of internationalization (online internationalization gap) between the Global North and the Global South...|$|E
