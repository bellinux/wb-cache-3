The four non-commercial frictional materials were fabricated with various percentages of phenolic binder resin (15 and 20 vol. %) and reinforced with steel fibers (15 and 20 vol. %) using hot press molding methods. Tribo tests were carried out using a small-scale tribo-tester of pad-on-disc type. Friction coefficient and wear of non-commercial and commercial brake pads were measured against each counterdisc (GCI and DGCI) and compared. Then, the friction and wear characteristic are discussed by comparing the experimental results obtained for each kind of cast iron. The results showed that maximum friction coefficient (0. 4 – 0. 5) of brake pad was attained at 2. 22 MPa applied pressure and 2. 1 m/s sliding speed when the frictional brake <b>pad</b> <b>materials</b> were tested against DGCI disc rotor. Meanwhile, similar wear rates for all frictional brake <b>pad</b> <b>materials</b> were sustained at higher applied pressure and sliding speed when tested against either type of rotor discs (GCI and DGCI). The results on the other hand, indicated that non-commercial materials NF 1 and NF 4, gave better wear resistance compared to <b>other</b> frictional <b>pad</b> <b>materials.</b> NF 2 exhibited the lowest wear resistance when tested against GCI and DGCI rotor disc at all applied pressure and sliding speeds.

40|$|Chemical-Mechanical Planarization (CMP) is {{a crucial}} {{intermediate}} process in integrated circuit (IC) fabrication. As the average IC feature size decreases each year, scratches produced on wafers from polishing pads during CMP have become a prominent issue. These scratches can be much larger than features on the circuits, which results in an increase of damaged and discarded wafers after CMP. To determine the mechanisms of CMP pad scratching, an analytical model based in thermomechanics was constructed. This model accounted for potential sources of energy dissipation, which are important in properly understanding and accounting for processes which produce damage on the wafer. Multiple forms of energy dissipation were investigated through experimental analyses that include strain energies, energy flux through material removal, and internal energy dissipation. Mechanical characterization of CMP <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> and planarization experiments were performed. ^ Porous polyurethane polishing <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> was mechanically characterized in compression and in tension to properly model its constitutive behavior during CMP. Stress relaxation experiments of the <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> in compression were performed to construct a stress relaxation model. The results showed that viscoelastic strain energy is significant in CMP processes. Additionally, the polishing pad relaxation behavior varied {{depending on whether the}} pad was loaded in tension or compression. The viscoelastic relaxation rate of the <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> increased after being soaked in distilled water and CMP slurry. This result suggests pad scratching can be reduced with proper soaking of the <b>pad</b> <b>material.</b> Measurements of <b>pad</b> compressibility were also performed by optically tracking pad samples which were under compressive stresses. This analysis quantified the significance of the <b>pad</b> <b>material’s</b> compressibility with regard to its internal stresses. ^ Planarization experiments were performed to gather experimental information on mechanical and topographical changes of the <b>pad</b> and wafer <b>materials</b> through the CMP process. Generally, the coefficient of friction between the <b>pad</b> and wafer <b>material</b> decreased with increasing polishing time. From the constructed contact stress analysis, a smaller coefficient of friction resulted in the reduction of von Mises stress in the wafer material. The surface of a polishing pad became smoother with increasing polishing time. Experimental planarization results showed that roughness of the pad surface may have an influence on the coefficient of friction, while both of these variables relate to the scratching ability of the <b>pad</b> <b>material.</b> Plastic smoothing of the pad surface also indicated that the plastic strain energy dissipated into the <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> is important for the CMP thermomechanical model. ^ Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of worn <b>pad</b> <b>material</b> was conducted to observe potential energy dissipation into the pad’s polymer structure during planarization. Polishing pad calorimetry results showed a measurable increase in the computed enthalpies of reaction of pad samples with {{an increase in the number}} of wafers polished. These results suggest energy is dissipated into the <b>pad’s</b> <b>material</b> structure during CMP and may have an influence on scratch production. ...|$|R
