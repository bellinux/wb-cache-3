40|$|Abstract. The {{precision}} turning experiments {{of aluminium}} composites reinforced with SiC whisker reinforcements were done by polycrystalloid diamond (PCD) tools. <b>The</b> measure analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machined</b> surface {{was carried out}} with Atom Force Microscope (AFM) and Scan Electronic Microscope (SEM). <b>The</b> roughness values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machined</b> surface were measured by Talysurf- 6. The results show that <b>the</b> orientation <b>of</b> reinforcements in <b>the</b> <b>machined</b> surface will directly affect <b>the</b> deformation mechanism <b>of</b> SiC whiskers, microstructures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machined</b> surface, and to determine <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machined</b> surface. In <b>the</b> five types from A to E of SiC whisker orientation, <b>the</b> orientation <b>of</b> case A easily makes to produce SiC whisker deformation by cutting off directly, and to result in <b>the</b> best <b>machined</b> surface. However, for <b>the</b> orientation <b>of</b> case E, it easily makes to induce SiC whisker deformation by pulling out or pressing into aluminium matrix, and to produce <b>the</b> worst <b>machined</b> surface...|$|R

5|$|The {{interior}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> {{was very}} complicated {{and designed to}} mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E

40|$|Kinematic errors due to {{geometric}} inaccuracies in five-axis machining centers cause deviations in tool {{positions and}} orientation from commanded values, which consequently affect geometric accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machined</b> surface. As {{is well known}} in <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> tool industry, machining of a cone frustum as specified in NAS 979 standard is a widely accepted final perforance test for five-axis machining centers. A critical issue with this machining test is, however, that <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine’s</b> error sources on <b>the</b> geometric accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machined</b> cone frustum is not fully understood by machine tool builders and thus it is difficult to find causes of machining errors. To address this issue, this paper presents a simulator of machining geometric errors in five-axis <b>machining</b> by considering <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> kinematic errors on <b>the</b> three-dimensional interference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tool and the workpiece. Kinematic errors of a five-axis machining center with tilting rotary table type are first identified by a DBB method. Using an error model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machining</b> center with identified kinematic errors and considering location and geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workpiece, <b>machining</b> geometric error with respect to <b>the</b> nominal geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workpiece is predicted and evaluated. In an aim to improve geometric accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machined</b> surface, an error compensation for tool position and orientation is also presented. Finally, as an example, <b>the</b> <b>machining</b> <b>of</b> a cone frustu...|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and {{the largest and most}} drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Machine</b> Gun Corps were established {{in the southern part of}} Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and the East Coast main line railway station at Grantham. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Machine</b> Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish church.|$|E

More modern recreations of the game for computers have been made as well. An emulated version of the original game, based on the original source code made publicly available by Martin Graetz and running in a JavaScript PDP-1 emulator, was made available to play on the internet in 2012.

When Dr. Patricia Hill (Mary Peach) arrives, she helps them fix the error, making Steiner think the problem has been solved. Meanwhile, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Wooland), Steiner's boss and head of the institute he works for, is being blackmailed by Mr. Latham (Derrick De Marney), who wants credit for Steiner's discovery. He forces Blanchard to demand Steiner to give a premature presentation to Professor Lembach (Gerard Heinz).|$|E

5|$|Ferranti {{began work}} on {{building}} the computer on 1 December 1950, with engineer Raymond Stuart-Williams adapting the design by Bennett into a working machine. Development was completed by 12 April 1951, resulting in a device twelve feet wide, nine feet deep, and five feet tall. The majority of the volume was taken up by vacuum tubes and the light bulbs that displayed {{the state of the}} game, with the actual computer taking up no more than two percent of the total volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine.</b> The Nimrod took the form of a large box with panels of lights, with a raised stand in front of it with buttons corresponding with the lights, which in turn represented the objects the player could remove.|$|E

5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases {{the top of the}} pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E

5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} the exterior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine,</b> and re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed {{the ability to}} display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, {{and the ability to}} show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> prior to the planned production start date. Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, {{to go along with the}} plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|E
