5|$|In 1975, Stephen Hawking {{published}} a calculation which suggested that black holes {{are not completely}} black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. At first, Hawking's result posed a problem for theorists because it suggested that black holes destroy information. More precisely, Hawking's calculation seemed to conflict {{with one of the}} basic postulates <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>mechanics,</b> which states that physical systems evolve in time according to the Schrödinger equation.

40|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} equations <b>of</b> Wigner <b>quantum</b> <b>mechanics</b> are the Moyal and the stargenvalue equations.

The aim of this letter is to present the formal solution of a general stargenvalue equation in arbitrary dimension, both for continuous and discrete spectra. The properties of the formal solution will be studied and a geometrical interpretation given in terms <b>of</b> star-hypersurfaces in <b>quantum</b> phase space.

5|$|Quantum {{gravity is}} {{the branch of}} physics that seeks to {{describe}} gravity using the principles <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>mechanics.</b> Currently, the most popular approach to quantum gravity is string theory, which models elementary particles not as zero-dimensional points but as one-dimensional objects called strings.

5|$|The AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} resolves {{the black}} hole information paradox, {{at least to some}} extent, because it shows how a black hole can evolve {{in a manner consistent with}} quantum mechanics in some contexts. Indeed, one can consider black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. These particles obey the usual rules <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>mechanics</b> and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion, so {{the black hole}} must also evolve in a unitary fashion, respecting the principles <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>mechanics.</b> In 2005, Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdS/CFT correspondence, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information.|$|E
