The present 	paper explains this distribution is one of approximate 	method of Gaussian distribution as follows: 	 1) <b>Ordered</b> <b>size</b> distribution deals only a large positive 	portion among a distribution and Gaussian one does the 	whole，and any values of positive and negative. 2) Logarithmic 	<b>ordered</b> <b>size</b> distr:lbution can be available when 	both ranges of order and variables are nearly equal，where 	the range means the ratio between the maximum value and 	the minimum. When both ranges are nearly equal， the 	logarithmical type can be available，and elsewise the 	power type does. 3) For example，two constants in the 	<b>ordered</b> <b>size</b> distribution can be decided from the three 	constants in Gaussian one and allowable approximation 	error...|$|R

40|$|Companies, {{especially}} those in e-business, are increasingly offering free shipping to buyers whose <b>order</b> <b>sizes</b> exceed the free shipping quantity. In this paper, given that the supplier offers free shipping, we determine the retailer's optimal <b>order</b> lot <b>size</b> and the optimal retail price. We explicitly incorporate the supplier's quantity discount, and transportation cost into the model. We analytically and numerically examine the impacts of free shipping, quantity discount and transportation cost on the retailer's optimal lot sizing and pricing decisions. We find that free shipping can benefit the supplier, the retailer, and the end customers, and can effectively encourage the retailer to order more of the good, {{to the extent of}} ordering a few times of the optimal <b>order</b> lot <b>size</b> without free shipping. The <b>order</b> lot <b>size</b> will increase and the retail price will decrease if the supplier offers proper free shipping. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R

5000|$|Therefore, {{using the}} {{simplified}} {{example of a}} single-product firm, a firm would maximize profit by determining the price that maximizes contribution to profit (i.e., contribution margin per unit multiplied {{by the number of}} units sold), since the fixed costs that will next be subtracted will, by definition, be a constant regardless of the number of units sold. Due to the relative differences in <b>order</b> <b>size</b> and the efforts that a retailer or distributor have to make, different industries have different typical distribution margins.|$|E
