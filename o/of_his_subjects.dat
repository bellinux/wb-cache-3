5|$|Charles was universally beloved, beloved {{not only}} by the crowd of {{individuals}} with whom he came in contact, not only adored by his dependents, but thoroughly popular with the mass <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> and particularly with the poorer populace of London who knew him best.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{lived a life}} {{of luxury}} that was often far removed {{from that of the}} {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects.</b> However, his personal charm with people at all levels of society and his strong condemnation of prejudice went some way to assuage republican and racial tensions building during his lifetime.|$|E
50|$|Raffaello was {{primarily}} a renowned portraitist of great esteem; {{he knew how to}} capture the spirit <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subject,</b> their manner, style, expression and character. He possessed the ability to expose the rawness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subject,</b> which had made him immediately famous from the time <b>of</b> <b>his</b> training. He preferred for his models to talk and move to enable him to create a lively similarity.|$|R

5|$|Tvrtko {{is widely}} {{considered}} one of Bosnia's greatest medieval rulers, having enlarged the country's borders to their greatest extent, left a strong economy, and improved the living standards <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects.</b> He was survived {{by at least one}} son, Tvrtko II, but was succeeded by Dabiša, under whom Tvrtko's burgeoning realm began to decay.|$|E
5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E

5|$|An {{elaborate}} {{series of}} foundation rituals preceded construction. A further set of rituals followed the temple's completion, dedicating {{it to its}} patron god. These rites were conducted, at least in theory, by the king {{as part of his}} religious duties; indeed, in Egyptian belief all temple construction was symbolically his work. In reality, it was the work of hundreds <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects,</b> conscripted in the corvée system. The construction process for a new temple, or a major addition to an existing one, could last years or decades.|$|E
5|$|Ladislaus vanquished a Cuman {{army that}} invaded Hungary in 1282. Hungary also survived a Mongol {{invasion}} in 1285. Ladislaus had, by that time, become so unpopular that many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> {{accused him of}} inciting the Mongols to invade Hungary. After he imprisoned his wife in 1286, {{he lived with his}} Cuman mistresses. During the last years of his life, he wandered throughout the country with his Cuman allies, but he was unable to control the most powerful lords and bishops any more. Pope Nicholas IV planned to declare a crusade against him, but three Cuman assassins murdered Ladislaus.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{attended}} the selective Melbourne High School, where Australian test captain Bill Woodfull was his mathematics teacher. Miller was a mediocre student, which disappointed Woodfull; however, Woodfull quickly noticed Miller's cricket skills. Aged 14, Miller {{was selected for}} the school's first XI, scoring 44. His control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him The Unbowlable—Woodfull's own nickname. In 1934, Miller failed all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects,</b> scoring zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class, {{and was forced to}} repeat the year.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{scholarly}} reception {{has considered}} The Shortest Way in negative terms, as a failed satire, or as using irony so slight {{as to be}} undetectable. Such a conclusion cites the contemporary reaction to the work, how it failed to deliver its objectives and also caused its author such problems. If critics have offered praise, it {{is the extent to}} which Defoe managed to impersonate the style <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects,</b> so as to be indistinguishable from them. The Shortest Way is frequently contrasted with another work of irony in the eighteenth century, which is considered to have succeeded in its use of the device, Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal (1729).|$|E
5|$|The art {{of glass}} making {{is thought to}} have {{developed}} during Ahmose's reign. The oldest samples of glass appear to have been defective pieces of faience, but intentional crafting of glass did not occur until the beginning of the 18th dynasty. One of the earliest glass beads found contains the names of both Ahmose and Amenhotep I, written in a style dated to about the time of their reigns. If glassmaking was developed no earlier than Ahmose's reign and the first objects are dated to no later than his successor's reign, it is quite likely that it was one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> who developed the craft.|$|E
5|$|The {{delegated}} form {{of governance}} {{in the existing}} or acquired provinces is recommended by the text, with the qualification that the province should be ruled by someone born there. However, all ministers in immediate vicinity of the king must be born in the long established state. The king, states the text, must watch out and act against bureaucrats and officials who torment his subjects. The text cautions that the king should prevent abuse <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> from officials, robbers, enemies, king's favorites and his own greed.|$|E

5|$|A general {{perception}} on Narayan {{was that}} he did not involve himself or his writings with the politics or problems of India, as mentioned by V. S. Naipaul in one of his columns. However, according to Wyatt Mason of The New Yorker, although Narayan's writings seem simple and display a lack of interest in politics, he delivers his narrative with an artful and deceptive technique when dealing with such subjects and does not entirely avoid them, rather letting the words play in the reader's mind. Srinivasa Iyengar, former vice-chancellor of Andhra University, says that Narayan wrote about political topics only in the context <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects,</b> quite unlike his compatriot Mulk Raj Anand who dealt with the political structures and problems of the time. Paul Brians, in his book Modern South Asian Literature in English, says that the fact that Narayan completely ignored British rule and focused on the private lives of his characters is a political statement on its own, declaring his independence from the influence of colonialism.|$|E
5|$|After a brief stay in Europe, Atangana {{returned}} to his homeland in Cameroon, which by then was a League of Nations mandate territory under {{the administration of the}} French Third Republic. The French doubted his loyalties at first, but Atangana served them with the same ardour he had shown the Germans and regained his post as paramount chief. During the remainder of his life, he oversaw the Westernisation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> and the improvement of his domains despite the erosion of his powers due to French policies and unrest among his people. He never advocated resistance to the European powers, preferring to embrace the European as a means of personal enrichment and in the service of African interests. After his death in 1943, Atangana was largely forgotten. However, since Cameroon's independence in 1960, Cameroonian scholars have rediscovered his story.|$|E
5|$|After his succession, Charles quarrelled {{with the}} Parliament of England, {{which sought to}} curb his royal prerogative. Charles {{believed}} in the divine right of kings and thought he could govern according to his own conscience. Many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> opposed his policies, in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent, and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch. His religious policies, coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic, generated the antipathy and mistrust of reformed {{groups such as the}} English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters, who thought his views too Catholic. He supported high church ecclesiastics, such as Richard Montagu and William Laud, and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years' War. His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops' Wars, strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments and helped precipitate his own downfall.|$|E

5|$|Discussing {{the larger}} culture of {{violence}} that Chicago police had created, journalist Spencer Ackerman in February 2015 reported that Zuley, by then retired from COPD, had served in 2003-2004 with the US Navy Reserve as an interrogator at Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, established by the George W. Bush administration. (Zuley {{had returned to the}} CPD after his Navy service.) In 2003, one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> was the high-profile detainee Mohamedou Ould Slahi, for whom the Secretary of Defense had authorized extended interrogation techniques, since classified as torture. Slahi's memoir, Guantanamo Diary, was published in January 2015, and quickly became an international bestseller. He detailed the torture he suffered. Ackerman noted that inmates with claims or suits against Zuley had recounted details that are similar to the physical and psychological abuse against Slahi. Local Chicago publications identified Zuley as a protege of Burge, but Ackerman said that the two officers never served together. Zuley primarily served on the North Side.|$|E
5|$|In 1337 Phillip confiscated Aquitaine and Ponthieu from Edward alleging he was {{harbouring}} Phillip’s fugitive {{cousin and}} enemy, Robert of Artois. In response, Edward proclaimed himself king of France {{to encourage the}} Flemish to rise in open rebellion against the French king. The conflict, later known as the Hundred Years' War, included a significant English naval victory at the Battle of Sluys, and a victory on land at Crécy, leaving Edward free to capture the important port of Calais. A subsequent victory against Scotland at the Battle of Neville's Cross resulted in the capture of David II and reduced the threat from Scotland. The Black Death brought a halt to Edward's campaigns by killing perhaps a third <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects.</b> The only Plantagenet known to have died from the Black Death was Edward III's daughter Joan in Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|In 1517, the Wittenberg monk Martin Luther publicised The Ninety-Five Theses, {{challenging}} the Roman Catholic Church and initiating the Protestant Reformation. In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg established Lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to Catholicism, but also decreed that {{the faith of}} the prince was to be the faith <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>subjects,</b> a principle called Cuius regio, eius religio. The agreement at Augsburg failed to address other religious creed: for example, the Reformed faith was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler, such as happened in Electorate of Cologne in 1583. From the Cologne War {{until the end of the}} Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands. The latter reduced the overall population of the German states by about 30 per cent, and in some places, up to 80 per cent. The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the German states. German rulers were able to choose either Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism or the Reformed faith as their official religion after 1648.|$|E
