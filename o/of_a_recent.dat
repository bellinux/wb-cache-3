After the Joker kills Elizabeth on their honeymoon, Bruce swears revenge, while Clark tries to hold him back. Bruce blames Clark for her death, and the two go against one another. Ultimately, Lex Luthor is revealed to have masterminded the entire plot to get Batman and Superman to destroy each other. The two decide to team up and stop Luthor.

5|$|In 1903–04 Vaughan Williams started {{collecting}} folk-songs. He {{had always}} been interested in them, and now followed the example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> generation of enthusiasts such as Cecil Sharp and Lucy Broadwood in going into the English countryside noting down and transcribing songs traditionally sung in various locations. Collections of the songs were published, preserving many that could otherwise have vanished as oral traditions died out. Vaughan Williams incorporated some into his own compositions, and more generally was influenced by their prevailing modal forms. This, together with his love of Tudor and Stuart music, helped shape his compositional style {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E

5|$|In the dry season, {{the gray}} mouse lemur faces the {{challenge}} of exploiting sparsely distributed feeding resources efficiently. Results <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> study on this showed that the gray mouse lemur does not move around randomly, but rather use spatial cues to ﬁnd food resources {{in the absence of}} sensory cues, and that they seem to reuse common, highly efficient routes with regard to travel distance. It is believed that rather than using a route-based network, the gray mouse lemur has some sense of mental representation of their spatial environment, which they use to find and exploit food resources.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 New York Giants {{season was}} one of the most {{successful}} seasons in the professional football franchise's history. The Giants, who play in the National Football Conference (NFC) of the National Football League (NFL), won their sixth championship and second Super Bowl. Led by linebacker Lawrence Taylor and quarterbacks Phil Simms and Jeff Hostetler, the Giants posted a 13–3 record before defeating the Chicago Bears and the two-time defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers in the NFC playoffs. In Super Bowl XXV, they defeated the Buffalo Bills 20–19 in Tampa Stadium against a patriotic backdrop inspired by the recently started Gulf War.

5|$|García sent captain Pedro de Zubiaur, {{his senior}} officer, on towards the lake. He arrived at Lake Petén Itza with 60 musketeers, friar San Buenaventura and another Franciscan and allied Yucatec Maya warriors. They were also {{accompanied}} by about 40 Maya porters. On 2 February the expedition {{was approached by}} two Itza warriors who told them <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> battle between a Guatemalan expedition and the Itza; these two Itzas guided the party to a nearby Itza settlement, and the letter from Avendaño was shown to captain Zubiaur, convincing {{him that he could}} advance safely. The port town of Ch'ich' was abandoned but a large number of canoes approached, judged to be as many as 300 by the Spanish captain, bearing perhaps 2,000 Itza warriors. The warriors began to mingle freely with the Spanish party and began to load the Spanish supplies into the canoes with a promise of transporting the expedition across to Nojpetén, with one soldier in each canoe. The Franciscans readily boarded the canoes, with two soldiers as an escort. A scuffle then broke out; a dozen more of the Spanish party were forced into canoes, and two porters were beaten to death. One of the captured Spanish soldiers was immediately decapitated. At this point the Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Noul, {{known as}} Typhoon Dodong within the country, entered the Philippine area of Responsibility on May7. In {{response}} to the storm, PAGASA raised warning signal 4, the highest level, for northeastern Cagayan {{as well as the}} offshore Batanes and Babuyan Islands. Neighboring provinces had lower warning signals. A total of 3,803people evacuated their homes in Cagayan and Isabela to 27storm shelters; families returned home by late on May10 after the storm moved ashore without causing much damage. Flights and ferry routes were canceled, stranding 10,000people. The Philippine Army deployed 18soldiers to assist in storm preparations, utilizing boats and helicopters. Fishermen were advised not to go out to sea east of Luzon. People were also evacuated from the vicinity of Mount Bulusan after rains from Noul threatened to cause lahars and mudslides from ash <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> eruption. They were allowed to return after Noul recurved to the north and the threat did not materialize. Two people in Cagayan died due to electrocution while attempting to fix their roofs ahead of the storm.|$|E
