40|$|The data {{obtained}} from cooling tests of an R- 2800 - 21 engine installed in a p- 47 G airplane were studied to determine which engine and airplane operation variables were mainly responsible for the extremely uneven temperature distribution among the 18 engine cylinders obtained at the medium and high engine-power conditions. The tests consisted of flights at altitudes from 5000 to 35, 000 feet for the normal range of engine and airplane operation. The {{results of the study}} showed that a flow condition in the induction system associated with the wide-open throttle position, which affected either the fuel air or charge distribution, was primarily responsible for the uneven temperature distribution. For the range of fuel-air ratios tested (0. 080 to 0. 102), the temperature distribution remained essentially unchanged. The individual effects of thrust-axis inclination, cowl-flap <b>opening,</b> <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> of auxiliary air were found to be secondary in importance. At low angles of throttle opening, engine speed was found to have little effect on the temperature pattern...|$|R
40|$|Transgenic Bt cotton {{may have}} reduced {{susceptibility}} to aflatoxin contamination {{as a result}} of pink bollworm resistance. During 1995 and 1996, Bt cottonseed from several commercial fields in Arizona contained aflatoxin levels unacceptable for dairy use. Comparison of cottonseed with and without BGYF (bright-green-yellow fluorescence) from one highly contaminated (> 6, 000 ppb aflatoxin B 1) Bt seed lot indicated that most contamination probably resulted from exposure of mature cotton to high humidity. Seed exhibiting BGYF was repeatedly detected in Bt cottonseed lots but, pink bollworm exit holes were not observed in the field. A field plot test in 1996 demonstrated high resistance among Bt cultivars to both pink bollworm damage and formation of BGYF seed cotton. These observations suggest that resistance to pink bollworm will result in reduced aflatoxin contamination when pink bollworm pressure coincides with conditions conducive to Aspergillus flavus infection. However, Bt cultivars are not resistant to aflatoxin increases occurring after boll <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> large <b>quantities</b> aflatoxin can form during this period...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Citrus genotypes show a {{broad range}} of {{resistance}} to infection with Xanthomonas citri subsp citri (Xcc), the causal agent of Asiatic citrus canker (ACC). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate a detached leaf inoculation method to compare nine different citrus genotypes that exhibit varied resistance levels to ACC, and to evaluate infection, colonization and symptom development of the varieties by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Inoculation of Xcc in the leaves was carried out by producing injuries with needles. Lesion diameters were measured at 7, 10 and 13 days after inoculation (DAI). The variety Pera IAC was most resistant to the pathogen and had lesions with smaller diameters, while the variety Washington was most susceptible and had the largest lesions, indicating low resistance to Xcc. SEM images were taken from the lesion development, and sections were obtained from the disease lesions in the tested varieties. The most resistant variety, Pera IAC, had smaller stomatal <b>openings</b> <b>and</b> produced greater <b>quantity</b> of foliar exudates, compared with the variety Washington. We hypothesize that the exudates may contain Xcc toxic compounds and thus may be a defense mechanism against infection by Xcc, but further research is required to establish any antibiotic effects of the exudates against citrus canker...|$|R

This paper is just aimed to draw some lessons from the EU banking integration experience for the <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> reform of China banking system. We first clarify the types and levels of different financial services integration.

The relationship between structure, competition and efficiency is the real point in realizing the benefits of integration. Thus the market structure, consolidation, efficiency types, risks and stability issues are touched together with the EU banking integration progress. In the third part of this paper, EU experience is drawn for the banking industry <b>opening,</b> reform <b>and</b> M&A in China. Just as the competition enhanced in the EU banking integration progress, banks in China are also facing fierce competition pressure and other problems.

40|$|Risk {{disclosure}} is {{an important}} issue, firstly to prevent future unexpected bankruptcies and economic scandals, secondly to create trust between a company and its stakeholders. Given {{the importance of the}} issue, previous literature has mainly focused on quantity of risk disclosures. In this dissertation, both quality <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> of risk disclosures in the annual reports of 65 companies listed on the Nasdaq OMX Stockholm exchange are analyzed. The objectives are to describe the degree of risk disclosures and to understand whether the quality <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> of this information can be explained by size, industry and/or performance of the company. By conducting a content analysis of the annual reports, we explored if the required risk information was disclosed (<b>quantity)</b> <b>and</b> how it was disclosed (quality). Afterwards, a statistical analysis was conducted in order to obtain {{a deeper understanding of the}} results from our content analysis. The findings of our study are that both quality <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> of risk disclosures in our sample are only half as good as they should be according to requirements in the Swedish context. We found that there is a difference in quality <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> of risk disclosures between two of the industry categories; Energy and Materials, where the first mentioned is the best and the second the worst. We did not find significant correlations between the quality <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> of risk disclosure and the size or the performance for the whole sample. Still, we found some differences in both quality <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> of risk disclosure information when looking at smaller parts of our sample. Size has a significant impact on both quality <b>and</b> <b>quantity</b> of risk disclosures within the Industrials and Information Technology companies. Among Information Technology companies, also performance has a significant impact on the quantity of risk disclosure...|$|R
