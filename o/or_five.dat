The Great Lakes storm, however, raged for more than 16hours, with an average speed of 60mph (100km/h), and frequent bursts of more than 70mph (110km/h).

This structure was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by the temple on the northern side, a palace {{on the south}}ern side and a long building on the east. The Jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically. Drawings by Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four <b>or</b> <b>five</b> terraces.|$|E
