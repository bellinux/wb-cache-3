5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> switches that establish a connection between two <b>or</b> <b>more</b> users. For both types of network, repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.|$|E
