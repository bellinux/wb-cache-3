5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is the similarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species.

These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E

Coupled with years of economic hardships and discontent of Tung's pro-Beijing stance, a mass demonstration broke out on 1 July 2003.
