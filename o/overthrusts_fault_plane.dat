40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the representation of}} the radiated energy, E_R, in earthquakes. In seismology E_R is estimated from either far-field seismic waves or the stress and displacement on the <b>fault</b> <b>plane.</b> Although E_R comes from the entire volume of the Earth, it can be expressed as an integral over the <b>fault</b> <b>plane.</b> However, the integrand cannot be given a simple physical meaning such as the radiated energy density on the <b>fault</b> <b>plane.</b> The stress on the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> changes rapidly during a seismic rupture. Although the energy radiated by this process is not included in the estimate of E_R in a simplified practice in seismology, it is correctly included in the expression of E_R in standard seismological practice. Using the representation theorem, we can express E_R as a surface integral over the <b>fault</b> <b>plane,</b> with the integrand containing the slip function on the <b>fault</b> <b>plane.</b> However, the integrand at a point depends not only on the slip function at the point but also on the slip functions everywhere on the <b>fault</b> <b>plane.</b> Thus, the simple method in which E_R is estimated by summation of the local energy flux on the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> does not yield a correct estimate...|$|R

30|$|The 1964 Niigata earthquake, which {{occurred}} {{to the south}} of these earthquakes, is a reverse fault earthquake with an E-W compressional axis (Hirasawa, 1965; Aki, 1966 a, b). There have been various studies of the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> of the earthquake using different kinds of geophysical data, and both westward-dipping and eastward-dipping <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> models have been proposed. Vertical and horizontal crustal movements on land have been explained by a westward-dipping <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> model with a steep angle (Abe, 1975; Matuhashi et al., 1987), while a vertical crustal movement at the ocean bottom has been explained by a gently eastward-dipping <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> model (Satake and Abe, 1983). Although aftershocks have been relocated to obtain the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> of the mainshock, {{it is very difficult to}} identify the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> because of the poor determination accuracy of hypocenters (Kayano, 1968; Hamada, 1983; Fujiwara and Seno, 1985; Mori and Boyd, 1985; Kusano and Hamada, 1991). Using a Bayes method for temporary observations of aftershocks, Kayano and Imoto (1989) concluded that hypocenters were distributed along the east-dipping <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> rather than along the west-dipping one, based on the Akaike Bayes Information Criteria (ABIC).|$|R

40|$|A two-step {{technique}} {{has been developed}} {{with the aim of}} retrieving the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> orientation of a small-magnitude earthquake. The technique uses a set of non-linear equations, which relate the rise times of first P waves to source parameters (source dimension L, dip delta and strike phi of the fault) and intrinsic Q(p). At the first step of the technique, the inversion of P polarities provides two <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> orientations for each focal mechanism solution. At the second step, the inversion of rise times is carried out to retrieve L and fQ(p) by fixing delta and phi to the values of the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> orientation inferred at the first step. A robust analysis, based on the random deviates technique, allows us to evaluate if one <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> exists which systematically better fits data and can be considered the 'true' <b>fault</b> <b>plane.</b> A parameter is introduced to quantify the level of resolution of the 'true' <b>fault</b> <b>plane.</b> A probabilistic approach, {{based on the assumption that}} errors on data are Gaussian distributed, allows us to a posteriori validate or reject the 'true' <b>fault</b> <b>plane.</b> The {{technique has}} been applied to 47 small earthquakes (1. 3 < M-L < 3. 9) occurred below the town of Sellano, during the 1997 Umbria-Marche (Central Italy) seismic crisis. The strike of the inferred <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> is generally along the Apennine direction. <b>Fault</b> <b>plane</b> solutions can be mainly subdivided into two groups: a first group of SW-dipping faults and a second group of NE-dipping faults.

40|$|Abstract: Missing pay {{sections}} in faulted areas {{is a common}} occurrence. An accurate measurement of the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> and surrounding bed distortion can substantially reduce the risk involved in the sidetrack decision. The measurement of the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> includes the dip and strike {{as well as the}} sealing nature of the <b>fault</b> <b>plane.</b> Our experience indicates mineral-filled <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> are always sealing. This has lead to several interesting sidetracks, many of which are against conventional wisdom. Case studies included show an extensional fault sidetrack to the downthrown block; a perforating determination based on the location of the actual sealing fault; an extensional fault sidetrack based on the non-sealing properties of the <b>fault</b> <b>plane.</b> In these cases the distortion of the surrounding blocks are modeled using enhanced computer techniques (Etchecopar 1992). The input of the actual <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> dip and strike is shown to be the key to an accurate cross-sectional projection. The visualization of the fault model is critical to the resolution f the sidetrack azimuth and distance. Whether a <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> is sealing is also an important contribution to any sidetrack analysis. This technique has accurately predicted the sidetrack location for many successful wells.

30|$|The <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> of {{the largest}} {{aftershock}} derived {{in the present study}} is located at the northern end of the aftershock area within 24 hours after the main shock. If the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> {{of the largest}} aftershock {{is a part of the}} <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> of the main shock, the Pacific plate must have moved northwestward during the main shock and southeastward during the largest aftershock. This movement of the Pacific plate seems quite unnatural. Judging from the focal depth and the focal mechanism solution of the main shock, the depth of the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> of the main shock is about 20 km in the epicentral area of the largest aftershock, while the focal depth of the largest aftershock determined by JMA is 40 km. Therefore, the <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> of the two events would be almost parallel to each other.|$|R

50|$|As {{the fault}} grows upward, it {{cuts through the}} newly formed {{sedimentary}} layers at the top. Therefore, the overall displacement along the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> is not the same. Further, the lowermost layer has higher displacement than the uppermost layer while the intermediate layer displacement lies in between (fig. 2). Because the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> flattens into décollement, the downthrown block moves basinward and the displaced sedimentary layer of the downthrown block bends close to the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> forming rollover anticline, synthetic and antithetic faults. Figure 3 is an E-W seismic line at Svalbard area showing footwall, hanging wall and the geometry of sedimentary layers around the <b>fault</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|R

30|$|We {{defined a}} {{rectangular}} <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> using the low angle nodal {{plane of the}} MDC solution and USGS PDE location (38.322 °N and 142.369 °E, depth = 24 km). The strike of <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> has been slightly modified to 198 ° to match {{the orientation of the}} Japan trench axis. We considered a large planar fault with a dimension of 500 km (along strike) by 200 km (along dip). The source depth changes from 5 km to 39.5 km relative to sea level. This <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> is further divided into 200 25 km by 20 km subfaults. The distance from the hypocenter to the tip of the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> is 110 km.|$|R
30|$|The {{distribution}} of the slip vectors indicates that a thrust fault mechanism with a small left-lateral strike-slip component (assuming the NE-SW plane is the active plane) occurred near the hypocenter and in deep parts. However, a small left lateral strike-slip is dominant in shallow parts of the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> mainly NE of the epicenter. The moment release and displacements rates in the shallower parts of the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> are smaller than the deeper parts of the <b>fault</b> <b>plane.</b> This situation could reduce {{the chances of a}} continuous surface rupture. If the rupturing of the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> reached the surface, the left-lateral strike-slip component could be mainly seen at the northeast of the main fault.|$|R
30|$|Fault segment # 1 of the mainshock {{spatially}} overlapped the rupture {{area of the}} foreshock but had {{a different}} dip angle from the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> of the foreshock.

This implies a complex fault structure along the Futagawa–Hinagu fault system. In order to examine this hypothesis, further studies on aftershock relocation and reflection surveys to image the complex structure of <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> in the source region are necessary.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} reveal the tectonic {{implication}} of the reversal of focal mechanisms, not only the hypocenter locations and the focal mechanism solutions of the two events, but also the relative location of the two <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> ought {{to be taken into}} account. The spatial distribution of aftershocks within 24 hours after the main shock, shown in Fig. 1, suggests that the length of the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> of the main shock was about 150 km along the fault strike and the width was about 100 km along the dip direction (Kanamori, 1971). On the other hand, the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> of the largest aftershock is not known, because the largest aftershock occurred only 10 hours after the main shock, and the aftershock distribution cannot be used to estimate the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> of the largest aftershock. Although Hatori (1969) estimated the tsunami source area of the largest aftershock, it is desirable to infer the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> from seismic data. In the present study, we attempt to infer the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> of the largest aftershock from records of strong ground motion. We apply the method presented by Izutani and Hirasawa (1987 a, b) for evaluating the fault length and the direction of rupture propagation from the azimuth dependence of the duration of strong ground motion.|$|R

The width of the aftershock distribution narrows near the hypocenter of the mainshock rupture (section  01 in Fig.  2 b). However, the northern extension of the aftershock distribution is sporadic and aligns along a conjugate west-dipping <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> (sections  05 and 06 in Fig.  2 b).

To estimate the detailed {{locations of the}} <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> of the three M 6 -class foreshocks and the main shock, we started by assuming the initial <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> whose centroids were located at the hypocenter of each main shock. The orientations of the <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> were determined from the nodal planes of their F-net focal mechanisms determined by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED) (Fukuyama et al. 2000), {{with reference to the}} aftershock distributions to determine the preferable plane (Fig.  3). The lengths and widths of the <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> were derived from the empirical scaling relations for magnitude, slip amount, fault length and fault width (Utsu 2001). We then adjusted the location and orientation of the initial fault models to obtain better alignment with the hypocenter distribution of their aftershocks in Figs.  2 and 3. We manually fit the data with our own eyes to estimate more robust and reliable fault geometry than that by fitting them with regression analysis because of the existence of events occurring off the main shock faults (Fig.  3). Furthermore, we constrained the shallow portions of the <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> by referring to the observed surface ruptures of the main shock. This is because it was difficult to estimate the shallow portion (depths of less than a few kilometers) of the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> from the aftershock distribution due to very few aftershocks at the shallow depth as well as the uncertainties in the focal depth of very shallow events.|$|R
