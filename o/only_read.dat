5|$|As with The Quatermass Experiment, {{the film}} {{rights to the}} serial were {{purchased}} by Hammer Film Productions — in this case after they had <b>only</b> <b>read</b> the scripts, before the serial was even made. Titled Quatermass 2, the film was released in 1957 and once again directed by Val Guest, with Brian Donlevy starring; unlike the first film, Kneale wrote the screenplay himself. In the United States, the film was released under the title Enemy from Space.|$|E
5|$|Through the {{strength}} of his reputation, Hitchcock cast Leigh for a quarter of her usual fee, paying only $25,000 (in the 1967 book Hitchcock/Truffaut, Hitchcock said that Leigh owed Paramount one final film on her seven-year contract which she had signed in 1953). His first choice, Leigh agreed after having <b>only</b> <b>read</b> the novel and making no inquiry into her salary. Her co-star, Anthony Perkins, agreed to $40,000. Both stars were experienced and proven box-office draws.|$|E
5|$|The Shooting Star shared plot {{similarities}} with The Chase of the Golden Meteor, a 1908 {{novel by}} pioneering French science-fiction writer Jules Verne. As in Hergé's story, Verne's novel features {{an expedition to}} the North Atlantic to find a meteorite fragment containing a new element. In both stories, the competing expedition teams were led by an eccentric professor and a Jewish banker, and Verne's novel had a Doktor Schultze to Hergé's Professor Schulze—both from the University of Jena. Hergé denied deliberately copying Verne's story, {{saying that he had}} <b>only</b> <b>read</b> one of the French novelist's works; {{it is possible that the}} influence from Verne came via Jacques Van Melkebeke, Hergé's friend and assistant, who was a fan of the genre. The Swedish expedition member Eric Björgenskjöld physically resembles a real person: Auguste Piccard, who later became Hergé's inspiration for Professor Calculus.|$|E

5|$|Both the Zygalski-sheet {{method and}} each bomba worked {{for only a}} single {{scrambler}} rotor order, so six sets of Zygalski sheets and six bomby were produced. However, the Germans introduced two new rotors on 15 December 1938, giving a choice of three out of five to assemble in the machines on a given day. This {{increased the number of}} possible rotor orders from 6 to 60. The Biuro could then <b>only</b> <b>read</b> the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have the resources to produce 54 more bomby or 54 sets of Zygalski sheets. Fortunately, however, the fact that the SD network was still using the old method of the same indicator setting for all messages, allowed Rejewski to re-use his previous method of working out the wiring within these rotors. This information was essential for the production of a full set Zygalski sheets which allowed resumption of large-scale decryption in January 1940. On 1 January 1939, the Germans made military Enigma even more difficult to break by increasing the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight, to between seven and ten.|$|E

25|$|While {{traditional}} media, like {{newspapers and}} television advertising, are largely overshadowed {{by the rise of}} social media marketing, there is still a place for traditional marketing. For example, with newspapers, readership over the years has shown a decline. However, readership with newspapers is still fiercely loyal to print-only media. 51% of newspaper readers <b>only</b> <b>read</b> the newspaper in its print form, making well-placed ads valuable.|$|E
25|$|The works {{employ a}} stream of {{consciousness}} narrative style, and some critics believe that Picasso never meant for the plays to be staged, <b>only</b> <b>read.</b> Desire Caught by the Tail was first performed as a reading. Jean-Paul Sartre, Valentine Hugo and Simone de Beauvoir starred alongside Picasso, while Albert Camus directed. It was restaged in 1984 (with David Hockney acting) by the Guggenheim Museum.|$|E

25|$|The {{system used}} in The Americas {{and much of}} the Far East is NTSC. Western Europe, Australia, Africa, and Eastern South America use PAL (though Brazil uses a hybrid PAL-M system). Eastern Europe and France uses SECAM.

25|$|In 1929 he sailed for Europe {{with some}} of his school friends to study {{painting}} in Paris. There he not only studied painting, but sculpture with Charles Despiau. To this has been attributed the weight and three-dimensionality of his work. In Europe he was able to see first hand the masterpieces he had <b>only</b> <b>read</b> about. True to his nature of never wanting to be second best, Tytla {{came to the conclusion that}} he could never top these masters and destroyed most of his work.|$|E

25|$|In compounds, okurigana {{may be omitted}} {{if there}} is no {{ambiguity}} in meaning or reading – in other words, if that compound is <b>only</b> <b>read</b> a single way. If okurigana occur after several characters (esp. both {{in the middle of the}} compound and at the end of the compound, as in 2-character compounds), either only the middle okurigana, or both the middle and the final okurigana may be omitted; omitting only the final okurigana but retaining the middle okurigana is rather unusual and somewhat questionable, though not unknown (marked with “?” below).|$|E
25|$|Lehi prisoners {{captured}} by the British generally refused to present a defence when brought to trial. They would <b>only</b> <b>read</b> out statements in which they declared that the court, representing an occupying force, had no jurisdiction over them and therefore was illegal. For the same reason, Lehi prisoners refused to plead for amnesty, {{even when it was}} clear that this would have spared them the death penalty. In one case Moshe Barazani, a Lehi member, and Meir Feinstein, an Irgun member, committed suicide in prison with a grenade smuggled inside an orange so the British could not hang them.|$|E
25|$|While Ford's {{articles}} were denounced by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the articles explicitly condemned pogroms and violence against Jews, but blamed the Jews for provoking incidents of mass violence. None {{of this work}} was written by Ford, but he allowed his name {{to be used as}} author. According to trial testimony, he wrote almost nothing. Friends and business associates have said they warned Ford about the contents of the Independent and that he probably never read the articles (he claimed he <b>only</b> <b>read</b> the headlines). However, court testimony in a libel suit, brought by one of the targets of the newspaper, alleged that Ford did know about the contents of the Independent in advance of publication.|$|E
50|$|Quaresma is {{fluent in}} German, French and English; however, he <b>only</b> <b>reads</b> works of Brazilian authors or foreign authors whose works were about Brazil. His {{favorite}} authors {{were those who}} were considered the most patriotic: José de Alencar and Gonçalves Dias.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, aged 20, Mahaney had met Larry Tomczak, {{with whom}} he led and taught a large local prayer group. He says his <b>only</b> <b>reading</b> in {{theology}} at that time had consisted of the Bible and The Late, Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey.|$|R
50|$|Wigglesworth {{learned to}} read after he married Polly; she taught him to read the Bible. He often stated {{that it was the}} only book he ever read, and did not permit {{newspapers}} in his home, preferring the Bible to be their <b>only</b> <b>reading</b> material.|$|R
25|$|The {{reputation}} of the author was confirmed and extended by the appearance, in 1827, of Hope Leslie, the most decided favourite of all her novels. She wrote other things afterward, that {{in the opinion of}} some of the critics are superior to either Redwood or Hope Leslie. But these later writings had to jostle their way among a crowd of competitors, both domestic and foreign. Her earlier works stood alone, and Hope Leslie, especially, became firmly associated in the public mind with the rising form of a native literature. It was not <b>only</b> <b>read</b> with satisfaction but familiarly quoted and applauded as a source of national pride. Her subsequent novels followed at about uniform intervals, Clarence, a Tale of our Own Times appearing in 1830.|$|E
25|$|Relief carving became {{common in}} 5th century BC Greece, and {{gradually}} {{most of the}} spectacular carved gems in the Western tradition were in relief, although the Sassanian and other traditions remained faithful to the intaglio form. Generally a relief image is more impressive than an intaglio one; in the earlier form the recipient of a document saw this in the impressed sealing wax, while in the later reliefs it {{was the owner of}} the seal who kept it for himself, probably marking the emergence of gems meant to be collected or worn as jewellery pendants in necklaces and the like, rather than used as seals – later ones are sometimes rather large to use to seal letters. However inscriptions are usually still in reverse ("mirror-writing") so they <b>only</b> <b>read</b> correctly on impressions (or by viewing from behind with transparent stones). This aspect also partly explains the collecting of impressions in plaster or wax from gems, which may be easier to appreciate than the original.|$|E
500|$|Hebel's admirers include Goethe, Gottfried Keller and Tolstoy. Goethe, {{who tried}} to write a poem (the [...] "Schweizerlied", Swiss song) in Alemannic himself, praised the Allemannische Gedichte highly. According to him, Hebel [...] "countrified the {{universe}} in the most naive, graceful fashion". But {{on the question of}} whether he would translate Hebel's works, Goethe said: [...] "Such a great poet should be <b>only</b> <b>read</b> in the original! One just needs to learn this language!" [...] The Brothers Grimm also admired Hebel, and he met Jacob Grimm in Karlsruhe in 1814.|$|E
