40|$|Abstract. In the past, {{different}} {{methods have been}} investigated regarding the production of curved workpieces by open-die forging as a significant demand for <b>open-die</b> <b>forged</b> parts with excellent mechanical properties exists. Current ways to produce curved workpieces by open-die forging have the disadvantages of complex preforms and inflexibility. One alternative approach to realize the production of curved workpieces by open-die forging is to actively control the material flow in open-die forging by superimposed manipulator movements during a forging stroke. Since the currently formed material between the forging dies is in a plastic state during the deformation, the required bending forces can be reduced significantly. This concept is investigated in a first study for the cold-forging of an aluminum alloy by numerical simulation and experiments on laboratory scale. For the process, the bite ratio, height reduction and the intended bending angle were identified as most important process parameters. Both numerical and experimental investigation proved the feasibility of the process principle since the bending forces, moments and the bending work can be reduced significantly...|$|E
40|$|Co-Al-W alloys {{strengthened}} {{with the}} L 12 gamma-prime phase have promise as next generation high temperature materials {{due to the}} ability to engineer a high gamma-prime content alloy with a higher gamma-prime solvus and higher melting point than many Ni-base gamma-prime strengthened alloys. Furthermore, these Co-Al-W gamma-prime alloys are interesting as potential cast-and-wrought alloys because they have a relatively narrow range of solidification temperature and large range of temperature between the gamma-prime solvus and the solidus, suggesting than manufacturing via an ingot metallurgy route would be feasible. However, since J. Sato et al discovered gamma-prime in the Co-Al-W alloy system in 2006, the focus in the literature has been on characterizing the structure and properties of these alloys and measuring and assessing the thermodynamics of the alloy system primarily for application as castings for turbine blade applications. To date the author is not aware of any publications describing the microstructure of vacuum induction melted, vacuum arc remelted ingots of a size more than about 2 kg. Most work has been performed using small, laboratory-scale, cast-and-hot-rolled samples or samples cast as single crystals. This paper presents ATI's experience in assessing the feasibility of manufacturing a cast-and-wrought billet product in the Co-Al-W-X alloy system. Three 22 [*]kg heats were produced to examine a small range of alloy compositions of potential commercial interest: Co- 9 Al- 9 W, Co- 9 Al- 10 W- 2 Ti, and Co- 9 Al- 10 W- 2 Ti- 0. 02 B, respectively.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{maximize}} grain growth of <b>open-die</b> <b>forged</b> 6061 aluminum alloy parts, samples from three of Weber Metals’s suppliers (Hidal Co-Almex USA Inc., TST Inc., and Vista Metals Corp.; to be called Supplier H, Supplier T, Supplier V respectively) were cut into cylinders with diameters of 0. 75 ˝ and heights of 2 ˝, and put through a simulated forging process and heat treatment. It is possible that additional alloying elements may be promoting or inhibiting grain growth in the final part. Maximizing grain growth for aluminum alloy parts results in improved resistance to intergranular corrosion. Samples from each vendor had grain size analysis performed prior to running the experiment. Samples were heated to just over 650 ºF so that when placed in the Instron compression machine for simulated forging they would be between the usual forging temperatures for aluminum of 550 to 650 ºF. Samples were compressed {{at a rate of}} 50 mils/second to final strain values of 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 50 %. The samples were then heat treated at 1050 ºF for a soak of 4 hours. This allows for maximum grain growth to occur before being removed and quenched in water to room temperature. A sectioning, sanding to 600 grit sandpaper, etching with 10 % NaOH, and desmut with 33. 33 % nitric acid allows for grain size analysis to determine which vendor had the largest grain size at each strain value.

This poses several material and processing challenges {{to ensure that the}} components have metallurgical stability and the required mechanical properties in the high temperature environment. Modelling the <b>open-die</b> press <b>forging</b> process, used to manufacture steam turbine discs from cast ingots, is complex due to the variation of strain, strain rate and temperature within the ingot. These variations mean that recrystallisation and grain growth do not occur uniformly throughout the ingot. Severe plastic deformation is used to promote recrystallisation in order to refine the grain size and improve strength and toughness properties. A major part of the modelling described in this paper involves prediction and validation of strain, strain rate and temperature distributions during <b>open-die</b> <b>forging.</b> A sensitivity study has confirmed the requirement for accurate thermal and physical data such as Interfacial Heat Transfer Coefficient (IHTC), work-piece emissivity, specific heat and friction coefficient.

5000|$|The {{second half}} of the 19th century was marked with the {{appearance}} of hydraulic forging presses that started to replace hammers at forging works. Forging in forging presses is carried out by two dies of which one makes reciprocal movements and the other one remains stationary. This is the reason for relatively low productivity and high labour intensity of conventional forging in presses. The forging of low-ductility and hard-to-deform steels and alloys by two dies using conventional forging methods is very difficult and sometimes is practically impossible because of high tensile stresses in deformation zone leading to various forging defects and high percentage of rejected products.In the 1970s the mechanical radial forging machines (RFM) started to be used for the large-scale production of long-axis forgings where a work piece is reduced in radial directions simultaneously by several pairs of dies. The process of radial forging in mechanical RFM features high productivity of forging. However small single reductions of a work piece restricted by the design of these machines lead to localization of strains mainly in surface zones of the work piece while metal in the core zone remains unworked. [...] In 80-90s hydro-mechanical and hydraulic radial forging machines appeared that do not have the disadvantages inherent to mechanical RFM. Nevertheless, radial forging machines are very specific and very expensive equipment in comparison with multipurpose forging presses. The application of such machines at enterprises {{with a wide range of}} forgings manufactured is economically disadvantageous and inexpedient.The problem of manufacturing long-axis forgings by radial <b>forging</b> method in <b>open-die</b> hydraulic <b>forging</b> presses can be solved with use of multi-die forging devices.

The four-die forging devices have no analogues in the world now. They are successfully used at works in Russia, Ukraine, Spain, China and Germany.|$|R
