40|$|Abstract The {{subprime}} mortgage {{crisis has}} negatively affected individuals, investors, lenders, and economies worldwide. This paper first examines contributing factors of the crisis: predatory lending, predatory borrowing and mortgage fraud, unethical practices, unregulated mortgage brokers, <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activity,</b> and the infusion of capital from Asia that provided the fuel for subprime mortgage activity to continue. International markets have both suffered from {{and contributed to the}} crisis. Legislation that has been enacted or recommended in the U. S. and the European Union is reviewed. We then make recommendations which could begin to restore confidence of consumers and investors worldwide; however, it is clear that laws and regulations must be enacted quickly to correct the situation and bring stability to investment markets...|$|E
40|$|With {{a sample}} of 354 U. S. large bank holding companies, this paper investigates the {{determination}} of financial distress in financial institutions. We find that: (1) the house price index is consistently significant and positively associated with the Distance-to-Default (DD) measure in the U. S. banking market; (2) all the three major banking risk characteristics i. e. non-performing loans, short-term wholesale funding, and the credit-risk indicator are reliable factors behind DD determination; (3) for the two alternative measures of BHC activity diversification, non-interest income is positively related with BHCs’ DD whereas <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activity</b> is negatively associated to the financial distress measure; and (4) Relevant capital requirements indicators including Tier I Risk-Based Capital Ratio, Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, Tier I Leverage Ratio should be taken in regulatory assessment of BHCs’ financial distress. ...|$|E
40|$|Regulatory capital {{requirements}} are {{the core of}} risk management embodied in the Basel Accords. In this paper we question {{the effectiveness of this}} approach in actually reducing the risk financial institutions accept. We thoroughly analyze a large cross-section of bank holding company data from 1993 to 2008 to determine the relationship between capital and bank risk-taking. To deal with the endogeneity between risk and capital, we employ stochastic frontier analysis to create a new type of instrumental variable. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence to validate the use of the proposed instrument for bank capital. Our results support the theory that banks respond to more capital by increasing the risk in their earning asset portfolios and <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activity.</b> This perverse result suggests that bank regulation should be thoroughly reexamined and alternative tools developed to ensure a stable financial system...|$|E

30|$|By {{using the}} data of 197 banks, we {{estimated}} that in 2005, Chinese banks created liquidity of 16.20 billion USD. 6.92 billion dollars were created by on-balance-sheet activities, and 9.24 billion dollars were generated by <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities.</b> The overall liquidity creation decreased to 9.90 billion USD in 2007 before increasing to 12.20 billion USD in 2009. This increase in liquidity {{was the result of}} money injected to the banking system to stabilize it after the eruption of financial crisis in the USA in 2007. In 2009, on-balance-sheet liquidity creation stood at 6.01 billion USD, and off-balance-sheet liquidity creation amounted to 4.90 billion USD. So, the amount of liquidity created by on-balance-sheet activities exceeded the amount of liquidity generated by <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities</b> in 2009.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Against the {{background}} of the acknowledged importance of off-balancesheet exposures in the sub prime crisis, we seek to investigate whether this was a new phenomenon or common to earlier crises. Using a logit approach to predicting banking crises in 14 OECD countries we find a significant impact of a proxy for the ratio of banks ‟ <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activity</b> to total (off and on balance sheet) activity, as well as capital and liquidity ratios, the current account balance and GDP growth. These results are robust to the exclusion of the most crisis prone countries in our model. For early warning purposes we show that real house price growth is a good proxy for off balance sheet activity prior to the sub-prime episode. Variables capturing off-balance sheet activity have been neglected in most early warning models to date. We consider it essential that regulators take into account the results for crisis prediction in regulating banks and their off-balance sheet exposures, and thus controlling their contribution to systemic risk...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a brief overview}} of developments currently taking place in the Australian banking sector relating to the measurement and management of credit risk. Section I provides, as background, a sketch of the structure of banking in Australia. Section II considers some of the forces operating within the Australian banking and financial system to increase the significance of credit and capital management in banks. Section III outlines some of the credit risk management practices being adopted in the major Australian banks. Section IV looks at the implications of these developments and speculates on the scope for greater use of banks ’ internal credit risk models, or other possible approaches, for capital adequacy purposes. A summary and brief conclusion are in Section V. I. THE STRUCTURE OF BANKING IN AUSTRALIA The banking system in Australia can be summarised in a number of simple statistics. It comprises forty-three banking groups, with aggregate global assets totaling more than A$ 900 billion.

40|$|The {{point has}} often been made that {{institutional}} arrangements are important in determining {{the way in which}} money is created and the effects that it has. The most recent phases of institutional development have been currently identified with liability management and <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activity.</b> This paper argues that more recent changes, only some of them associated with the practice of banks ’ bidding for deposits, may have taken us to a new stage, at least in the UK. To begin with, competition for deposits has increased money’s own rate of return relative to the return on other assets (and the cost of liabilities) and has made that rate more sensitive to changes in market interest rates a s a whole. Taken together, these two developments have had major impacts: upon the money supply process, the willingness of agents to hold the resulting deposits and the ability of the authorities to influence the growth of credit. Furthermore, the origin of the demand for credit has undergone major changes in recent years. If it was ever true that loans originated largely with firms ’ need for working capital, it is now abundantly clear that the demand for credit rests very heavily upon asset (‘speculative’) transactions which have grown much more rapidly than GDP. Changes in the quantity of money no longer reflect prior changes in the level and cost of production. Professor Peter G A Howells...|$|E
30|$|Although {{the measure}} of {{liquidity}} creation established by Deep and Schaefer (2004) was not comprehensive, it was a step forward. Following their work, Berger and Bouwman (2009 a) established four much better measures of liquidity creation. The measures created by them are known as “cat nonfat,” “cat fat,” “mat nonfat,” and “mat fat”. All the measures are similar {{in a way that}} they classify activities other than loans by using information regarding product category or maturity. They differ from each other on the basis of loan classification and on-balance-sheet and <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities.</b> “Cat” measures classify loans on the basis of category, and “mat” measures classify them on the basis of maturity. “Nonfat” measures exclude <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities,</b> but “fat” measures include them to calculate liquidity creation. Berger and Bouwman (2009 a) prefer cat fat measure over other measures. According to all the “BB” (Berger & Bouwman) measures, a bank create $ 1 of liquidity when it converts $ 1 illiquid assets into $ 1 liquid liabilities. Similarly, a bank destroys $ 1 of liquidity by transforming $ 1 of liquid assets into $ 1 illiquid liabilities. A bank does not create or destroy liquidity when it converts $ 1 of liquid assets into $ 1 of liquid liabilities or $ 1 of illiquid assets into $ 1 of illiquid liabilities or equity.|$|R
30|$|Liquidity {{creation}} {{is a better}} measure of risk compared to loan growth because it includes both on-balance-sheet as well as <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities</b> in the formula, but loan growth is based on on-balance-sheet activities only. Furthermore, bank liquidity {{creation is}} a more objective measure of risk taking compared with credit growth because liquidity creation gives us an absolute amount of risk transformation. According to liquidity creation, the overall risk taken by Chinese banks shows a declining trend over the period. Moreover, our results are more reliable because we have used data of 197 banks spanning 10  years, but the abovementioned study used the data of just 87 banks covering 8  years only.|$|R

These results seem to accord with Kim and Santomero (1988) who concluded that banks might be induced to shift to more risky assets under the current capital requirements for credit risk.

40|$|This {{analysis}} provides {{direct evidence}} of exams’ {{significant role in}} uncovering financial problems and ensuring bank accounting statements reflect them. Efforts requiring banks to divulge information on their financial condition have a long history. In the early 1800 s, some states required banks to file reports of condition with the governor or legislature, arguing the state was a shareholder in the banks and therefore entitled to the information (Robertson 1995). However, the reports contained only broad breakdowns of assets and liabilities and no information bank directors {{did not wish to}} disclose. In 1869, Congress empowered the comptroller of the currency to “call ” for a full statement of condition from national banks several times a year. Regulators have since made many changes to the resulting call report, but its purpose remains the same—to provide timely information regarding the condition of banks. The modern call report, or Report of Condition and Income, is filed quarterly by all banks and contains hundreds of accounting items that regulators and private analysts use to characterize the financial condition of both individual banks and the industry. Call reports now include detailed measures of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activity.</b> The level of detail is somewhat greater for large banks than for small ones, but even small banks file an extensive report. This article analyzes call report revisions to assess the extent to which regulatory exams promote accurate data. If the loan-loss accounting in call reports is widely used to measure loan quality, the findings support the view that exams are important in the public dissemination of accurate information on banks ’ financial condition.

30|$|The recent {{incarnation}} {{of the idea that}} banks create liquidity traces back to the studies of Bryant (1980) and Diamond and Dybvig (1983). According to these studies, banks create liquidity on-balance sheet by financing relatively illiquid assets with relatively liquid liabilities. Another set of studies point to the liquidity creation by <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities</b> of the banks. Holmstrom and Tirole (1998) and Kashyap et al. (2002) propose that banks also create liquidity off the balance sheet by commitments to provide liquidity to their clients, in case of need. Previous studies have also analyzed the role of banks as risk transformers. According to Diamond (1984) and Boyd and Prescott (1986), banks transform risk by issuing riskless deposits to lend risky loans. There are many similarities in the banks’ role as liquidity creator and risk transformer.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} one of the first {{attempts}} to conduct an empirical investigation of the relationship between bank capital, securitization and bank risk-taking in a context of the rapid growth in <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities.</b> The data come from the Canadian financial sector. Evidence from the 1988 - 1998 period indicates that: (a) securitization has a negative statistical link with both current Tier 1 and Total risk-based capital ratios, and (b) there exists a positive statistical link between securitization and bank risk-taking. Profit-risk measure is more sensitive than loss-risk measure to the variation in securitization activity. These results seem to agree, during the studied period, with models indicating that banks might be induced to shift to more risky assets under the current capital requirements for credit risk because the regulatory capital levels are considered too high. ...|$|R

Using Canadian data, we apply a modified Hausman procedure based on higher moments instruments and revisit this phenomenon to establish that the share of noninterest income (snonin) is actually endogenous to banks returns. In 1997, after {{the adoption of the}} Value at Risk (VaR) as a measure of banks risk, the snonin sign turns positive in the returns equations, indicating the emergence of diversification gains from banks non-traditional activities. ARCH-M estimations corroborate the idea that banks have gradually adapted to their new business lines, with an adjustment process begun even before 1997. However, the banks risk premium associated to OBS activities has continuously increased since that date.

30|$|This study {{explores the}} impact of NPLs on bank {{liquidity}} creation to know whether a moral hazard problem exists in Chinese banks or not. There are many studies which analyze bank liquidity creation and NPLs from different perspectives but {{to the best of}} our knowledge, none of the studies use these concepts to investigate a moral hazard problem. Existing literature regarding a moral hazard problem use credit growth as a measure of bank risk taking, which is subjective in nature. Bank liquidity creation is a better measure of risk taking because its objective and include both on-balance-sheet and <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities.</b> It calculates the amount of liquidity creation or risk transformation, which gives us absolute amount of risk taken by banks. Our null hypothesis is that Chinese banks create more liquidity when NPLs increase, i.e., a moral hazard problem exists in Chinese banks.|$|R
40|$|Through the {{interest}} rate deregulation and banks' <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities</b> (OBSAs) in Hong Kong, this study investigates {{the debate over the}} impact of banking deregulation on banks' risk-taking behaviour. On the one hand, the Arrow effect implies that increased competition caused by {{the interest}} rate deregulation motivates Hong Kong banks to speed up their development of OBSAs as an additional but riskier income source. On the other hand, the Schumpeterian effect implies that the deregulation may reduce the banks' financial capability in developing new products and thus downscale their OBSA adoption. Our findings show that, while the negative scale effect is statistically insignificant, {{the interest rate}} deregulation has a positive and significant impact on the adoption rate for all OBSA categories. We therefore conclude that the interest rate deregulation unambiguously leads to riskier bank behaviour in terms of higher OBSA adoption. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|R
30|$|To {{test the}} {{abovementioned}} hypothesis, {{we used the}} data from 197 listed and unlisted Chinese banks spanning 2005 to 2014. First of all, we calculated the dollar amount of liquidity created by using three step mechanism established by Berger and Bouwman (2009 a). We used “cat fat” measure to calculate the overall liquidity created by on-balance-sheet as well as <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities</b> and “cat nonfat” measure to compute liquidity creation by on-balance-sheet activities only. To address the possible issue of endogeneity, we used system GMM technique to estimate the effect of NPLs on bank liquidity creation. We found that liquidity creation by Chinese banks {{does not depend on}} level of NPLs, i.e., we did not find the evidence of a moral hazard problem in Chinese banks. To be sure about our findings, we repeated the analysis by using random effect, fixed effect, and pool data techniques. The results obtained by different techniques confirmed our finding that {{there is no evidence of}} a moral hazard problem in Chinese banks.|$|R
30|$|We {{extend the}} {{existing}} literature on the moral hazard problem, bank liquidity creation, and non-performing loans in a new direction. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this study is the first one to use the concept of liquidity creation and NPLs to study moral hazard problem. We believe that liquidity creation is a better measure of bank risk taking compared to loan growth because it not only includes on-balance-sheet activities but also risky <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities</b> in its formula. Liquidity creation is also a better measure because it provides us the absolute amount rather than a relative figure, which is offered by loan growth. Furthermore, loans may grow faster based on the policies adopted by government and not as a result of excessive risk taking but increase in liquidity creation shows the true risk taken by banks, regardless of the government policy. We also contribute to existing literature by providing the evidence regarding the moral hazard problem from an emerging market having a socialist system with Chinese characteristics.|$|R
40|$|The author {{documents}} some stylized {{facts about}} the Canadian financial structure. He explores these empirical facts {{in the context of}} Canadian financial legislation and finds that, over the 1990 s, Canadian businesses became more heavily dependent on financial markets as their primary source of external funding. Data display a trend towards a more "market-oriented" financial system. The analysis suggests that this new trend started after the 1980 amendments to banking legislation and was considerably accentuated after the 1992 amendments. The author constructs a new series for the <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities</b> of Canadian banks that converts the non-interest income of banks into a credit equivalent. Combined with other evidence, this credit-equivalent series suggests a healthy growth trend in banking activity. Financial institutions are broadening their business lines and participating more actively in the arrangement of market financing. Regarding direct finance, the data indicate that Canadian firms issue a substantial share of their bonds in the U. S. bond market, and an increasing share of their stocks in the U. S. stock market. The author conjectures that there is some form of incompleteness in the Canadian markets. A noticeable fraction of Canadian issuances in the United States involves riskier firms for which U. S. markets seem more mature. Financial institutions; Financial services; Recent economic and financial developments...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of {{shadow banking system}} in China catalyzes the expansion of banks' <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities,</b> resulting in a distortion of China's traditional credit expansion and underestimation of its commercial banks' overall risk. This paper {{is the first to}} incorporate banks' overall risk, endogenously into bank's production process as undesirable by-product for the estimation of banks' total factor efficiency (TFE) as well as TFE of each production factor. A unique data sample of 171 Chinese commercial banks, which is the largest data sample concerning with Chinese banking efficiency issues until now as far as we know, making our results more convincing and meaningful. Our results show that, compared with a model incorporated with banks' overall risk, a model considering on-balance-sheet lending activities only may over-estimate the overall average TFE and under-estimate TFE volatility as a whole. Higher overall risk taking of banks tends to decrease bank TFE through 'diverting effect'. However, significant heterogeneities of bank integrated TFE (TFIE) and TFE of each production factor exist among banks of different types or located in different regions, as a result of still prominent unbalanced {{development of}} Chinese commercial banks today. Based on newly estimated TFIE, the paper also investigates the determinants of bank efficiency, and finds that a model with risk-weighted assets as undesirable outputs can better capture the impact of shadow banking involvement...|$|R
40|$|The {{diversification}} benefits {{associated with}} banks <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities</b> (OBS), and particularly non- traditional activities, is a question much debated in the literature. These activities, related {{to the emergence of}} shadow banking, greatly contribute to the volatility of bank operating revenues, but their impact on accounting returns is less clear (Stiroh and Rumble 2006). In this paper, we use a Canadian dataset to revisit the risk-return trade-off associated with banks OBS activities and study the evolution of the endo-geneity of banks decision to expand their market-oriented business lines. Consistent with the changing mix of noninterest income OBS activities generate, we identify a structural break in 1997 which coincides with an increased impact of endogeneity on banks returns, and which also leads to an increased return on assets (ROA) and a surge in banking risk. We trace the sources of the greater volatility of noninterest income to a tighter cointegrating relationship between noninterest income and stock market indices after 1997. Intro-ducing a new, robust estimation method based on a modification of the Hausman procedure, we find that neglecting endogeneity greatly underestimates the positive impact of shadow banking on bank accounting returns, even when the subprime crisis is considered. Our main results suggest that the influence of market-based activities on the risk-return trade-off might be larger than what was previously thought.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years, the {{business}} mix of banks in Canada has changed significantly. Progress in information-processing technology, legislative changes, and market forces {{have combined to}} blur the traditional distinctions between banks and other financial institutions and have allowed banks to offer a much wider range of products and services. In this article, the author reviews the expansion of bank lending to households over this period and their recent movement into personal wealth management. While these trends were facilitated by revisions to legislation, they also reflected the changing needs of the "baby boom" generation, first as home-buyers and, more recently, as middle-aged investors. On the commercial and corporate side, banks reacted to {{the rapid expansion of}} securities markets (and to the reduced demand for intermediation by both lenders/depositors and borrowers) by moving into investment banking, after legislative changes opened this business to them in the late 1980 s. They also used their expertise in credit assessment and risk management to provide credit guarantees and to act as counterparties and intermediaries in derivatives markets. Notable in this broadening of bank activities has been their more recent entry into the trust, mutual fund, and retail brokerage business. The banks have also made preliminary forays into insurance. The expansion of <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities</b> has made fee income an increasingly important part of bank earnings. The article also looks at the emerging tools and techniques that will most likely transform the structure of banking in the future. ...|$|R

A leverage ratio can then be calculated for this replicating portfolio, which consists of own funds (equity) and borrowed funds equivalents (debt).

Recent studies (e. g., Stiroh and Rumble 2006) suggest that {{increasing}} OBS activities do not necessarily yield straightforward diversification benefits for banks. However, introducing a risk premium in the standard banks returns models, and resorting to an ARCH-M procedure, Canadian data suggest that banks risk-return trade-off displays a structural break around 1997. In the second subperiod of our sample (1997 - 2007), {{we find that the}} noninterest income generated by OBS activities no longer impacts banks returns negatively.

40|$|Financial {{services}} {{become more}} diversified, and also cause banks to compete fiercely. The bank performance {{is still one}} of the major concerns of the government, the financial practitioners and investors. Tavlas and Lutton(2003) broke apart the ROE by the Du Pont equation, and proposed the Revenue Generating Ability(RGA) principle. It took into account the value of <b>off-balance-sheet</b> <b>activities</b> and the effects of the loan loss provision on banks' income. Then they obtained the ratio, total income divided by total expenses, representing how much income each dollar of expenses may create. Therefore, this research will employ this ratio to examine the efficiency of the commercial banks in Taiwan. Moreover, we also use the Data Envelopment Analysis(DEA) method to evaluate the efficiency of the commercial banks, so as to avoid using a sole method to limit the integrity. We select numbers of branches, salaries and deposit as the input variables and loans, investment and non-interest income as the output variables in the DEA model to evaluate individual bank efficiency with CCR and BCC models. We also separate big and small banks based on their size of assets, and the empirical results show that there is no different technical efficiency between big and small banks in Taiwan by the Mann-Whitney's test for independent sample. However, the pure technical efficiencies of big banks are a little higher than small banks, but the scale efficiencies are inferior to them. For the results of RGA, the concealment of the assets quality in the loan loss provision can be reflected immediately, and this also demonstrated that the financial markets of Taiwan have always lived with the NPL problem. Moreover, we observe the efficiency changes in Taiwan's banks by the RGA principle and discover that the small efficient banks have better profitability; confirming they have scale efficiency form the DEA conclusion. The results of independent samples' tests reveal there is no difference between big and small banks. The change of RGA ratio is derived from the bank's efficiency changes, not from the scale itself. No matter what type is, only the banks, which continue to improve efficiency, can enhance the RGA ratio. 金融業務更加多元化，也導致各銀行彼此相互競爭更加劇烈。銀行的經營績效到底如何，會是政府、金融業者及投資大眾持續關心的焦點。Tavlas and Lutton（ 2003 ）藉由杜邦方程式拆解權益報酬率，提出收益產生能力（RGA）法則。其考慮了能顯示出非資產負債表上的價值，並加入備抵壞帳損失影響收益之效果，得到總收益除以總費用之比率，以檢視銀行平均每塊費用所可以創造的收益。所以，本研究將嘗試採用此比率檢視台灣銀行的效率性。另外，亦以資料包絡分析法（DEA）搭配收益產生能力法則評估台灣商業銀行的經營績效，避免僅使用單一方法衡量而限制了完整性。 DEA選取分行家數、薪資支出、存款作為投入項，放款、投資、非利息收入為產出項。分別透過CCR與BCC模式評估個別銀行的效率值。再依資產規模大小區分台灣的大、小銀行，採Mann-Whitney獨立樣本檢定，大、小銀行之總體技術效率值是沒有顯著差異的。另外，大銀行純粹技術效率表現稍佔優勢，規模效率則不如小銀行。 進而以RGA比率衡量個別銀行的效率值。隱含的備抵壞帳損失所影響之當期資產品質，藉著RGA比率可以立即被反映出來，也顯示出台灣地區金融機構一直面臨不良債權累積的考驗。透過RGA法則我們還可以了解效率性之變動。發現台灣的小銀行，不論是有效率或無效率，表現都不是十分的穩定；但體質好的小銀行，獲利能力並不輸大銀行，也驗證了DEA結論非大就是好的規模效率。獨立樣本t檢定顯示大、小銀行經營效率並無顯著差異。收益費用比率之變動非源於規模而是銀行本身效率性的改變。不管是何種型態，只要屬於維持效率改進的銀行，RGA比率才會成長。目 錄 第一章 緒論 第一節	研究背景與動機………………………………………………… 1 第二節	研究目的………………………………………………………… 4 第三節	研究流程與架構………………………………………………… 5 第二章 文獻探討 第一節	銀行經營原則與理論發展………………………………………. 7 第二節	銀行效率評估方法之探討…………………………………… [...] . 10 第三節	以DEA法進行銀行效率評估之相關研究……………………. 19 第四節	銀行業投入與產出之選取…………………………………… [...] . 21 第三章 研究設計 第一節	研究樣本與資料來源………………………………………… [...] . 25 第二節	DEA效率模式之建立………………………………………… [...] 25 第三節	RGA模式之建立……………………………………………… [...] 36 第四節	統計方法之建立………………………………………………… 41 第四章 實證結果分析 第一節	以DEA模式衡量效率值之結果………………………………. 44 第二節	以RGA模式衡量效率值之結果………………………………. 59 第五章 結論與建議 第一節	結論…………………………………………………………… [...] 76 第二節	研究限制與建議……………………………………………… [...] 78 參考文獻……………………………………………………………………… 7...|$|R

Banks have reacted to the challenges posed by the new operating environment by creating new products and expanding their activities to some uncharted business areas. In this paper, we study how modern banking which {{gave birth to the}} <b>off-balance-sheet</b> leverage <b>activities</b> affected the risk profile of U.

Special attention is paid on the deleveraging process that occurred in the banking market after the crisis erupted, which is an additional innovative feature of this study. Our findings reveal that leverage, both explicit and hidden off-the-balance-sheet, increases the individual risk of banking firms making them vulnerable to financial shocks.

The benefits of off-balance-sheet hedging were found to accrue from reducing (1) taxes, (2) expected financial distress costs, and (3) agency costs. Taxes. Hedging reduces the firm's tax liability by reducing the variability in taxable income. The value of hedging to the firm is a positive function of the convexity of the tax function and the variability of taxable income. Expected Financial Distress Costs. The value of hedging is a positive function {{of the degree to}} which hedging reduces the probability of financial distress and the costs of financial distress. Agency Cost. Due to the fact that bondholders and some managers hold fixed claims while shareholders hold variable claims, shareholders desire more risky projects than do bondholders or managers. Hedging reduces this conflict by allowing shareholders to undertake higher risk projects while protecting the holders of fixed claims. Firms can achieve the same benefits of hedging by using alternative strategies. Among the various alternatives to hedging are modifying the firm's capital structure, purchasing insurance, and modifying dividend policy. The amount of <b>off-balance-sheet</b> hedging <b>activity</b> undertaken by a specific firm is therefore a function of the value of hedging to the firm and the degree to which the firm has used alternatives to hedging. Using a regression analysis, this paper provides empirical evidence on the preceding relations. This study provides (1) the first empirical evidence into the reasons for a value-maximizing firm using off-balance-sheet hedging instruments, and (2) empirical insights into the way in which the firm's hedging decision interrelates with the capital structure, dividend, and insurance decisions...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary The Asian crisis {{highlighted}} {{deficiencies in}} the availability of information relating to the on and <b>off-balance-sheet</b> foreign currency <b>activities</b> of central banks and other public sector entities. This led the G- 10 Governors to ask the Euro-currency Standing Committee to establish a working group to develop a disclosure framework to address these shortcomings. Specifically, the group was asked to identify the statistical information that would enable markets to better assess the authorities' foreign currency liquidity position. This position comprises the foreign exchange resources {{at the disposal of}} the authorities that are easily mobilisable in times of need and the potential drains on those resources associated with the authorities' short-term foreign currency liabilities. The group was also asked to report on the most suitable framework for public disclosure, the specific form and content of the information to be released and the additional practical steps necessary to implement the chosen strategy. In its deliberations the group recognised that improvements in disclosure practices by G- 10 countries could help to encourage similar behaviour in emerging market countries. The analysis and recommendations of the working group should be assessed in the context of initiatives relating to disclosure currently under way in other forums. These include the work of a working party on transparency and accountability commissioned by a group of finance ministers and central bank governors from 22 economies (the "Willard Group") and planned steps by the IMF Executive Board to strengthen the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). In recognition of these initiatives, an IMF representative was {{invited to participate in the}} working group and information on disclosure practices was shared with the Willard Group working party. A representative from the European Central Bank (ECB) was also asked to participate in the group. The working group is of the opinion that a significant move towards enhanced disclosure is justified as regards both the content and the timeliness of the information. This conclusion was reached on the basis of a review of current disclosure practices in relation to the liquidity concept outlined in previous discussions among Governors and a cost/benefit analysis of such a step. Prevailing practices generally fall well short of providing the relevant information, particularly as concerns the potential short-term drains on reserves. As most recently highlighted by the Asian crisis, the failure to disclose the forward book of the monetary authorities is one important example. The main benefits of enhanced disclosure would be to improve the accountability of the authorities and the scope for markets to exercise financial discipline. This, in turn, could help to induce an earlier correction of unsustainable policies and allow market participants to form a more accurate view of the condition of individual countries, thereby also possibly limiting contagion. It was noted that effective market discipline mechanisms also require an appropriate framework for disclosure and reporting by private sector entities. Differing views were expressed in this regard and the group acknowledged that this issue deserved further analysis. The group weighed the possible benefits of greater transparency against some potential costs. These were seen as being primarily associated with reduced operational flexibility to intervene covertly in order to counteract exchange market pressures, with the uncertainties involved in the transition towards a more demanding disclosure standard and with the logistical burdens of implementation. The specific recommendations of the group take the form of: a "disclosure template" outlining the content of the information to be disclosed; prescribed standards of timeliness, including both periodicity and disclosure lags; a timetable for implementation; and a proposal for further work on disclosure standards for private market participants. The disclosure template, summarised below, has three distinguishing features. Firstly, it aims to be as comprehensive as possible with respect to the coverage of both institutions and financial instruments. As regards institutions, conceptually the template is intended to apply to all the public sector entities that would be responsible for, or involved in, counteracting currency crises. In practice, this should at least include the monetary authorities, defined here to include both the central bank and the central government (excluding social security), but depending on institutional arrangements could extend to other public sector entities. As regards financial instruments, the template attempts to cover all the relevant on and off-balance-sheet liquid assets and short-term liabilities. Comprehensiveness is designed to provide a meaningful picture and to limit the scope for shifting components of the liquidity position to undisclosed items. Secondly, the template seeks to be sufficiently detailed to allow market participants to reach informed judgements about both reserves and drains on them. Detail is provided in several respects. These include, inter alia: a sectoral breakdown (notably as between the monetary authorities and other public sector entities); the separate identification of financial instruments that might vary in terms of liquidity (e. g., gold, deposits with banks headquartered in the reporting country) or cash flow characteristics (e. g., contingent vs. predetermined; time profiles, as captured by a residual maturity breakdown of the fixed-term liabilities); and complementary memorandum items (e. g., undrawn unconditional lines of credit, debt indexed to foreign currency). Finally, the template prescribes valuation principles that are consistent with the focus on liquidity. This suggests reporting, as far as possible, mobilisable foreign exchange resources at (approximate) market values and the future profile of drains on these resources in nominal terms (the cash flow value when the drain occurs). The group recommends endorsement of the template. At the same time, it recognises that improvements are possible. A review by technical experts of the details of the presentation would be helpful in identifying improvements in the way some of the information is portrayed and in accomplishing effective implementation. The issues to be addressed include, in particular, the treatment of derivatives positions and the clarification of the relationship between the definitions used in the report and those adopted in the balance-of-payments conventions, which are largely based on the residence criterion. It is recommended that technical experts be asked to report on these issues as soon as possible. The working group devoted much attention to the issue of timeliness, particularly in the light of the substantial element of judgement called for in examining this question. There are two features of information disclosure that affect timeliness: the disclosure lag, which determines how out-of-date the information is when released; and the frequency or periodicity of the disclosure, which determines the extent to which the information ages between releases and affects the incremental "news" content of the release. The group agreed that a common frequency and disclosure lag should apply to all the items of the template (except one memorandum item, viz. the currency composition by group of currencies). To do otherwise could greatly undermine the template's usefulness as it would provide an avenue for concealing changes in liquidity through whatever items are reported in the least timely fashion. The group also agreed that it is technically feasible to set a very high frequency and short lag. At the same time, the concomitant gains in terms of market discipline had to be weighed against the possible need for flexibility in exchange market operations, either for reserve management purposes or for covert intervention. In order to preserve flexibility in reserve management, the group decided to allow for less frequent and less detailed disclosure of the currency composition of the portfolio. Furthermore, forward positions should be reported only insofar as the domestic currency is involved, since only those transactions imply a future change in total official reserves. As concerns covert intervention, views regarding the true extent and value of such flexibility varied somewhat within the group. This reflected several factors, notably differing experiences with exchange rate regimes, institutional settings and opinions about the range and likelihood of circumstances in which it was regarded as useful to retain market uncertainty about the occurrence and/or size of the authorities' operations. Two further considerations argued against a rapid move to the highest feasible frequency and shortest feasible lag: implementation costs (especially in the context of efforts to address the "Year 2000 problem" and the introduction of the euro); and, given the residual uncertainties involved, concerns that such a step, once taken, would be costly to reverse if it proved unwarranted. In the light of these concerns, the group recommends that a first step would be to adopt a standard of a one-month frequency and a disclosure lag certainly not exceeding one month, to be implemented on or before end-June 1999. Since the frequency and disclosure lag would apply to all the categories of the template - except one memorandum item - this would already represent a significant improvement compared with current practices. In addition, the group notes that central banks are not the only holders of foreign currency reserves or liabilities, so that the full implementation of its recommendations would also require endorsement and corresponding action by other public sector entities, in particular finance ministries or treasuries. The group also considered the benefits associated with similar transparency about the risk positions, including foreign currency positions, of all private financial intermediaries. The group was of the opinion that further parallel work is needed in this area. It noted that an initial analysis had been carried out by the Euro-currency Standing Committee in 1994, as published in the report on "public disclosure of market and credit risks by financial intermediaries" (the "Fisher Report"). In connection with the enhanced disclosure proposed for the official sector, the group recommends that the ECSC now revisit the question of the appropriate disclosure standards for all market participants with a view to elaborating a set of good practices. ...|$|R
