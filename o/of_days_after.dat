25|$|As the Railway minister, he has {{advocated}} instituting a rail regulator to fix rail fares, {{a policy}} that is diametrically opposite to the one by earlier railway ministers. He has also advocated de-politicizing the Railways {{and would like to}} restructure the Indian Railway Board, which lacked synergy before he joined. Trivedi believes that the Indian Railways can add 2% to India's GDP and is willing to go against his party's line of not hiking the fares. However, he believes the government must modernize the railways, for which a fare hike {{would not be able to}} generate adequate funds, and has publicly criticized the Prime Minister for not providing funds.. Trivedi is pushing for a national policy on railways, that would continue irrespective of political changes in the government. He has also said that the ministry is also open to the idea of privatization, which would allow more funds to be allocated to help the system cope with capacity. He stepped down as the Railway Minister on 18 March 2012, a couple <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> presenting his first ever Railway Budget in which he increased passenger fare. This did not go down well with his political party, Trinamool Congress and in particular its head West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.|$|E
25|$|During the 2014 NBA draft, the Suns drafted sophomore forward T. J.

After trying to obtain players like LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Bosh, and after losing key player Channing Frye to the Orlando Magic, the Suns decided to sign-and-trade for Sacramento Kings point guard Isaiah Thomas under a four-year contract worth $27 million {{in exchange for}} Alex Oriakhi, using a $7 million traded-player exception. On September 24, 2014, the Suns and Eric Bledsoe agreed on a five-year contract worth $70 million after months of inactivity between both sides for a new offer. A couple <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>after,</b> on September 29, 2014, they extended both Markieff and Marcus Morris to 4-year deals that combine to $52 million, with Markieff earning $32 million while Marcus gets the remaining $20 million. Right before the trade deadline on February 19, 2015, however, the Suns made moves to change the team made roster. After demanding a trade due to lingering frustrations with the front office {{and direction of the}} team, Goran Dragić and his brother Zoran were traded by the Suns to the Miami Heat for Danny Granger and Miami's 2017 and 2021 first-round picks in a three-team trade with the New Orleans Pelicans. Immediately right after the trade, the Suns made a surprising move in replacing Dragić by trading for Milwaukee Bucks guard Brandon Knight, sending away Tyler Ennis and Miles Plumlee to Milwaukee while also sending the Lakers' 2015 first-round pick to the Philadelphia 76ers. Isaiah Thomas was then traded right after to the Boston Celtics for Marcus Thornton and the Cleveland Cavaliers' 2016 first-round pick.|$|E
