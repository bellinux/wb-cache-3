5|$|After {{the team}} finds and stores Pierce's body, Mulder reviews Trepkos' {{fragmented}} notes. He finds references {{to a new}} silicon-based organism existing inside Mount Avalon; Scully, however, doubts his conclusions because of his mental state. Tanaka breaks into convulsions and displays a high fever, but refuses any help from Mulder or Scully. When he is put on a stretcher for a medivac pickup, Mulder notices a throbbing bulge in his neck. Tanaka flees {{into the woods and}} dies when a tentacle bursts out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> An autopsy by Scully finds sand in his lungs, indicating the existence of a silicon-based spore; she theorizes that when exposed, the spore infects the nearest hosts or otherwise dies. Mulder contacts the CDC to have them quarantine the site.|$|E
25|$|While {{following}} Norton, Somervell {{suffered a}} severe {{problem with a}} blockage <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> and he sat down to await his death. In a desperate last attempt, he compressed his lungs with his arms, and suddenly disgorged the blockage — which he described as the lining <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> He then followed Norton, who was by now 30 minutes ahead, unaware of the life-threatening episode to his partner.|$|E
25|$|Triple H {{suffered}} an injury during the 2002 Survivor Series match with swelling {{on the inside}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> which put pressure on his esophagus and trachea. This was caused after Rob Van Dam performed the Five Star Frog Splash {{off the top of}} one of the chambers. Triple H also expressed concern that he might have broken his wrist and noted anything could have caused it. Sheamus reportedly suffered a concussion during the Raw Elimination Chamber match in 2010.|$|E
60|$|Here he {{explained}} himself without words by drawing the edge <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand briskly across <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> then closing <b>his</b> eyes and making gurgling sounds, {{supposed to be}} uttered by a person undergoing the painful operation <b>of</b> having <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> cut.|$|R

25|$|In August 1989, doctors found a {{tumor in}} Davis' throat. Davis died in Beverly Hills, California, on May 16, 1990, aged 64, of {{complications}} from throat cancer. Earlier, when {{he was told that}} surgery (laryngectomy) offered him the best chance of survival, Davis replied he would rather keep his voice than have a part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> removed; he subsequently was treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. However, a few weeks prior to his death, his entire larynx was removed during surgery. Davis had often smoked four packs of cigarettes a day as an adult. He was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park. On May 18, 1990, two days after Davis's death, the neon lights of the Las Vegas Strip were darkened for 10 minutes as a tribute to him.|$|E
500|$|In early 1950, when.he was 55, Kimball, who {{had never}} smoked or used tobacco, began {{experiencing}} persistent hoarseness and after a physical examination, he underwent a biopsy of a white spot in his throat. The biopsy caused some brief voice impairment and indicated that Kimball had a throat infection but not cancer. In late 1956, Kimball's hoarseness returned, coupled with occasional bleeding in the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> Kimball's physician sent him to New York City to meet with Dr. Hayes Martin (18921977), an expert on cancers {{of the head and}} neck. [...] Martin performed another biopsy, which indicated [...] "borderline malignancy," [...] and in early 1957, Martin recommended immediate surgery. Kimball had neglected to seek approval from church president David O. McKay regarding his 1957 biopsy. At the time, the biopsy itself could cause permanent vocal damage. He felt that as an apostle, he should have sought McKay's approval before he underwent surgical procedures that could render him incapable of fulfilling apostolic duties.|$|E
500|$|On 26 December 1887, Frederick {{wrote that}} his [...] "chronic catarrh" [...] {{appeared}} to be taking [...] "a turn for the better and that [...] "a further bond has been forged between our people and myself; may God preserve it by giving me, when I resume my duties, the capacity to prove myself worthy of the great trust that has been shown me!" [...] A week later, however, on 5 January 1888, his hoarseness and the swelling under his left vocal cord returned, with the previously unaffected right side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> becoming inflamed. He ran high fevers and began coughing violently, with his breathing becoming more laboured. The doctors diagnosed perichondritis, an infection of the throat membrane. Frederick again became unable to speak, and suffered violent headaches and insomnia. On 29 January, Mackenzie returned to San Remo {{from a trip to}} Spain, and after examining his patient recommended an immediate tracheotomy. [...] The operation was conducted at 4 p.m. on 8 February, by which time Frederick was continually suffering from insomnia and [...] "embarrassing bouts of suffocation." [...] A cannula was fitted to allow Frederick to breathe; for the remainder of his life he was unable to speak and often communicated through writing. During the operation, Dr. Bergmann almost killed him by missing the incision in the trachea and forcing the cannula into the wrong place. [...] Frederick started to cough and bleed, and Bergmann placed his forefinger into the wound to enlarge it. The bleeding subsided after two hours, but Bergmann's actions resulted in an abscess in Frederick's neck, producing pus which would give Frederick discomfort for the remaining months of his life. Later, Frederick would ask [...] "Why did Bergmann put his finger in my throat?" [...] and complain that [...] "Bergmann ill-treated [...] ".|$|E

60|$|Thirty guineas' worth <b>of</b> Mechlin at <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> was drenched, empurpled {{and ruined}} beyond redemption, {{and on the}} breast <b>of</b> <b>his</b> blue satin coat a dark patch was {{spreading}} like a stain of blood.|$|R
2500|$|As a young child, Derfner {{attended}} Charles Towne Montessori School {{and later}} [...] Porter-Gaud School, where he excelled academically and was class valedictorian. He {{was also an}} avid singer, and considered singing as a career until his junior year of college, when severe gastric reflux numbed the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E
2500|$|One of Larry's {{attributes}} that was well-known {{to the public}} was his many tattoos, although he didn't have most of his tattoos until later in life (he got his neck tattoo {{when he was in}} his mid 40s in the mid 1990s). The tattoo on his neck, which went across the front <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> was often commented on. The tattoo read: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Jones had a {{handsome}} and strange voice. His singing was always partly about {{the appeal of}} the tones he produced, regardless of the meaning of the words. In this sense, Jones had something in common with singers of formal music and opera, though his means of vocal production were radically different from theirs. He sang from the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> rather than from deep in his diaphragm. He tightened his larynx to squeeze sound out. He clenched his jaw, instead of wriggling it free. He forced wind through his teeth, and the notes sounded weirdly beautiful." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bolton made a soft husky prefatory noise <b>of</b> {{protest in}} <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> {{which seemed to}} stimulate his wife to a more {{definite}} assertion, and she cut in before he could speak-- ...|$|R
60|$|He {{offered his}} hand, and Lanfear wrung it hard, a lump <b>of</b> {{gratitude}} in <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> choking any particular utterance, while a fine shame for his late hostile intention covered him.|$|R

2500|$|Lord Lyon was a {{bay horse}} that stood 15.3 hands high with [...] "good bone, flat feet and very short pastern joints" [...] and had four white socks. He was also {{described}} as [...] "odd-shaped" [...] and [...] "not quite correctly balanced {{in all his}} points." [...] According to his regular jockey Henry Custance, Lord Lyon was [...] "a very slight whistler" [...] until the condition was treated by firing (applying a hot rod, similar to pin firing) the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> Lord Lyon also possessed a docile and gentle temperament and was described by his trainer James Dover as [...] "the quietest horse I have got." ...|$|E

6000|$|The huge coastguardsman choked at this point, as Wilson {{had done}} before him; but, being more ready of resource, he {{turned it into a}} cough, and declared, sternly, that night-work must have given him a cold, or [...] "suthin' o' that sort."

60|$|Water {{was brought}} and {{administered}} to the sufferer; the first he had tasted in hours of physical anguish. It had the double effect <b>of</b> clearing <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> and <b>of</b> momentarily reviving <b>his</b> sinking system.

6000|$|... "Look, Baas," [...] said Hans, [...] "those wanderers did not lie; {{there is}} {{the house of the}} white man. I wonder if he drinks {{anything}} stronger than water," [...] he added with a sigh and a kind of reminiscent contraction <b>of</b> <b>his</b> yellow <b>throat.</b>|$|R

60|$|As Peter {{looked at}} Sprite he couldn't help {{thinking}} that there wasn't a daintier {{member in the}} whole Warbler family. <b>His</b> coat was <b>of</b> a soft bluish color with a yellowish patch in the very center <b>of</b> <b>his</b> back. Across each wing were two bars <b>of</b> white. <b>His</b> <b>throat</b> was yellow.

6000|$|Throop {{extended}} a big paw {{in a gesture}} <b>of</b> admiration and <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> needed clearing before he spoke. [...] "You're all right!" [...] he said. [...] "Hans is in big luck {{to have you on}} his side." ...|$|R

60|$|There was {{something}} that Lord Tennington {{wanted to say to}} Hazel Strong--he wanted very badly to say it, and to say it at once; but somehow the words stuck in <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> He started lamely a couple <b>of</b> times, cleared <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> became red in the face, and finally ended by remarking that he hoped the cabins would be finished before the rainy season commenced.|$|R
