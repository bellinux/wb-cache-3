25|$|New {{elections}} {{were held in}} October 1795, and brought into power a government dominated by moderate republicans; the Paris contingent <b>of</b> <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> included merchants, bankers, notaries, lawyers, {{as well as more}} radical revolutionaries and monarchists. Plots and uprisings succeeded one another; a conspiracy of monarchists attempted an uprising on 4 September 1797, but were quickly suppressed by the army. Radical Jacobins won the elections of April 1799, and allied themselves with their arch-enemies, the monarchists, to oppose the Directory. Among the twelve newly elected Directors and Ministers, seven had voted for the execution of the King. It appeared that the Revolution might begin again, when on 13 October 1799 Napoleon Bonaparte returned from his campaign in Egypt and organized a coup d’État that made him the First Consul.|$|E

25|$|According to the constitution, {{imposed by}} High Representative Paddy Ashdown on January 28, 2004 after local {{politicians}} {{failed to reach}} an agreement, the mayor of Mostar has to be elected by the city council with ⅔ majority. Ashdown abolished the six municipalities that were divided equally among Bosniaks and Croats {{and replaced them with}} six electoral units, ridding Mostar of duplicate institutions and costs. In the process Ashdown also reduced the number <b>of</b> <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> from 194 to 35. According to the constitution the constitutive nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs) are guaranteed a minimum of four seats and a maximum of 15 seats. 18 deputies are elected by the election units: 3 deputies from each district and 15 deputies are elected at the level of entire city. This move was opposed by the Party for Democratic Action (SDA) and the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).|$|E

[...] A candidate for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1800, he was defeated in an overwhelming 68–13 vote of the legislature by John Breckinridge, who had been the acknowledged leader of the just-concluded constitutional convention. [...] In 1802, Adair succeeded Breckinridge as Speaker of the House by a vote of 30–14 over Elder David Purviance, the candidate preferred by Governor James Garrard. [...] He continued to serve as Speaker for the duration of his tenure in the House. [...] In 1802, the legislature formed Adair County, Kentucky, naming it after the popular Speaker.|$|E
500|$|For the 1981 presidential election, both Le Pen and Pascal Gauchon of the PFN {{declared}} {{their intentions}} to run. However, an increased requirement on support by elected officials {{had been introduced}} for the election, which left both Le Pen and Gauchon unable to stand for the election. (In France, parties have to secure support from a specific number <b>of</b> <b>elected</b> <b>officials,</b> from a specific number of departments, {{in order to be}} eligible to run for election. In 1976, the number of required elected officials was increased fivefold, and the number of departments threefold.) The election was won by François Mitterrand of the Socialist Party (PS), which gave the political left national power {{for the first time in}} the Fifth Republic; he then dissolved the National Assembly to call a snap legislative election. The PS attained its best ever result with an absolute majority in the 1981 legislative election. This [...] "socialist takeover" [...] led to a radicalisation in centre-right, anti-communist, and anti-socialist voters. With only three weeks to prepare its campaign, the FN fielded only a limited number of candidates and won only 0.2% of the national vote. The PFN was even worse off, and the election marked the effective end of competition from the party.|$|E
500|$|Canadian Senator Douglas Roche, O.C., {{argues in}} The Case for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly that even an {{indirectly}} elected UNPA consisting of delegates appointed by national parliaments could create additional {{checks and balances}} by providing for oversight by a parliamentary body that would be independent of member nations' executive branches. It would open up the global policymaking process to a larger group <b>of</b> <b>elected</b> <b>officials</b> by shifting some power from the relatively small executive branches of countries to the larger legislative branches. According to Roche, globalization has tended to increase {{the power of the}} executive branch while marginalizing the legislative branch; for instance, U.S. Presidents since George H. W. Bush have been given [...] authority to negotiate trade agreements, subject to a [...] "yea or nay" [...] scrutiny by the U.S. Congress on the negotiated deal. A Property and Environment Research Center report argues that changes in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are another example of how international regulation removes checks and balances between the branches of government: [...] "The OECD was created by a 1961 treaty, ratified by the U.S. Senate, to help achieve economic growth. In April 1998, a ministerial meeting reinterpreted the treaty, adding social and environmental considerations to the economic ones. The United States executive branch agreed to the changes, but the Senate had no opportunity to debate this treaty, even though it was significantly different from the 1961 treaty. The executive branch had essentially negotiated a new deal without Senate approval." [...] World Federalist Canada Briefing Paper No. 30, however, suggests that UNPA proposals may spark opposition from the executive branches that stand to lose power: [...] "Experience has shown that civil servants and diplomats working in national foreign ministries are less likely to support or see the need for a UNPA. They view the UN as a forum for discussion among sovereign states; whatever action the UN takes is a result of bargaining and compromise among member states".|$|E
