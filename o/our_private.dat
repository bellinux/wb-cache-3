In 1979, PGP produced Shirley, a prime-time NBC series starring Shirley Jones, which lasted 13 episodes. They also produced TBS' first original comedy series, Down to Earth, which ran from 1984 to 1987 (110 episodes were produced). They also distributed the syndicated comedy series Throb. In 1985, they produced a game-show pilot called The Buck Stops Here with Taft Entertainment Television in 1985, hosted by Jim Peck; it was not picked up. Procter & Gamble Productions originally co-produced Dawson's Creek with Sony Pictures Television but withdrew before the series premiere due to early press reviews. They also produced the 1991 TV movie A Triumph of the Heart: The Ricky Bell Story, which was co-produced by The Landsburg Company, and continue to produce the People's Choice Awards.|$|E

Inspired by a {{paranoid}} breakup, [...] "Conjure Me" [...] is told from the perspective of an aggressive predator and obscure object of desire. On [...] "Kiss the Floor", the narrator recounts stealing a girl's virginity and avoiding her brothers. [...] "This Is My Confession" [...] has a theme of absolution. The lyrics depicts it as an empty sexual experience: [...] "Shove my head against the door, crawl inside and kiss the floor / Waiting for the sun again, drink it, smoke it, stick it in." [...] "The Temple" [...] is a cover of the song of the same name from the 1970 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. Dulli became a fan of the rock opera as a child when his babysitter played it. [...] "Let Me Lie to You" [...] has lyrics expressing passive cruelty and subtle manipulation. [...] "Tonight" [...] depicts a peaceful night as the backdrop for the narrator's corrupt one-track mind: [...] "Follow me down to the bushes, dear / No one will know, we'll disappear / I'll hold your hand, we'll never tell / <b>Our</b> <b>private</b> little trip to hell". The album's hidden track [...] "Miles Iz Ded" [...] is about seduction and alcohol, with a last call sensibility and despairing tone.|$|E

So, yeah, with some practical things that have to be made, some decisions here, with perhaps changing, in future years, not adversely affecting those who are reliant on retirement benefits today, for instance, Social Security benefits, but changing, perhaps, the eligibility in future years. That has to be something that we're brave enough, courageous enough, to start talking about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sites such as Facebook are {{becoming}} increasingly popular tools for methods of ending relationships and friendships, proving that although new media is {{being used as a}} tool for connecting with individuals, it is now creating new problems associated with disconnecting from others. Instead of the traditional phone call or face-to-face interaction between individuals, people are now starting to end relationships by simply changing their relationship status, knowing full well that their significant other will see it shortly. The problem with that is that you are left with no closure and the entire online world now knows you are no longer in a relationship. In a 2010 study conducted online, nearly one-quarter of the 1,000 individuals surveyed found out that their own relationship was over by seeing it on Facebook. New media websites have made <b>our</b> <b>private</b> lives much more public, {{especially when it comes to}} breaking up, since updates are able to be immediately viewed by everyone in our networks (which tend to be more people than we would normally tell personally); for example, having friends comment on your newly changed [...] "single" [...] relationship status, and having to explain what happened can be distressing.|$|E
2500|$|Matson found {{valuable}} {{support in}} Vipassana meditation and extensive psychotherapy during these later decades. Both endeavors brought depth to poems about relationships. Equal in Desire (ManRoot, San Francisco, 1982 and 1983) also expanded the direct expression style into love poems, {{at the same}} time including awareness of gender and pro-feminist concerns. Hourglass (Seagull Press, Oakland, CA: 1987) is a series of eight-syllable line sonnets with rhyme and half-rhyme schemes, each with a creative process travelogue in prose. All the poems celebrate meditation and the relation of mind and body, along with struggles inherent in establishing a practice. These came as his meditation took hold and blossomed. After he began Crazy Child workshops, Matson discovered he was one of many who, on cracking {{open the door to the}} creative unconscious, was overwhelmed by floods of images. Chaotic first drafts were eventually shaped into Squish Boots (Broken Shadow Publications, Oakland, CA: 2002), concerned with childhood and core family issues. The process fit William Carlos Williams’ teaching, [...] "The beauty of writing is…the discovery of something you DON’T know, rather than the synthesis [...] repetition of the things you do already know. It's a jump forward into life, unknown future life…." [...] Emotional daring and openness helped this effort contribute to the voice of Chalcedony Songs (Minotaur Press, WA: 2007, 2009). These came as protest of one of Matson's female characters, in an unfinished story, who faked her orgasms. Chalcedony explores intricate layers of love and relationship in an open and easily involved manner. Matson stayed with the challenge. He wrote from a female perspective and let that voice expand. The style, added to the consciousness of Squish Boots, developed into Matson's most authentic voice to date. In the background resonates his learning from Ancient Greek Classics, William Shakespeare, Walt Whitman, Ranier Maria Rilke, Pablo Neruda and Rumi, as well as contemporary poets. The voice aided in making a flexible structure for a series of poems, War Allies, inspired by difficult political times toward the end of the 20th Century, by 9/11, and by the encroachment of marketing into <b>our</b> <b>private</b> lives. The collection is scheduled for production by Torean Horn Press of Sonoma, California, in 2018. These poems, along with Chalcedony and current work, indicate that the primitive heart is at the basis of Matson's effort. His poems evolve in a roughly straight line from Beat lyrics to direct expression to a deeper level of language, involving the primitive heart and limbic system. The short essay Being Present: Paleo Poetry came about with help from Marie Martin, painter and childhood friend, and from John Paige (formerly Ceely) who has remained an insightful advisor since 1964.
