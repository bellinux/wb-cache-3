5|$|Time is also {{connected}} to the theme <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark.</b> In Shakespeare's day, plays were most often performed at noon or in the afternoon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words {{to create the illusion}} of day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion. He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to the illusion of its passage.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{beliefs are}} one {{possible}} source {{for understanding the}} symbolism in the mysteries of Isis. J. Gwyn Griffiths, an Egyptologist and classical scholar, extensively studied Book 11 of Metamorphoses and its possible Egyptian background. He pointed out similarities between the first initiation in Metamorphoses and Egyptian afterlife beliefs, saying that the initiate took {{on the role of}} Osiris by undergoing symbolic death. In his view, the imagery of the initiation refers to the Egyptian underworld, the Duat. Griffiths argued that the sun {{in the middle of the}} night, in Lucius' account of the initiation, might have been influenced by the contrasts <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> in other mystery rites, but it derived mainly from the depictions of the underworld in ancient Egyptian funerary texts. According to these texts, the sun god Ra passes through the underworld each night and unites with Osiris to emerge renewed, just as deceased souls do.|$|E

5|$|Longrich's {{conclusions}} {{were supported}} {{in a paper}} first published online in the journal Nature in January 2010. Fucheng Zhang and colleagues examined the fossilized feathers of several dinosaurs and early birds, and found evidence that they preserved melanosomes, the cells that give the feathers of modern birds their colour. Among the specimens studied was a previously undescribed specimen of Sinosauropteryx, IVPPV14202. By examining melanosome structure and distribution, Zhang and colleagues were able to confirm the presence <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> bands of colour in the tail feathers of Sinosauropteryx. Furthermore, the team was able to compare melanosome types to those of modern birds to determine a general range of colour. From the presence of phaeomelanosomes, spherical melanosomes that make and store red pigment, they concluded that the darker feathers of Sinosauropteryx were chestnut or reddish brown in colour. More research on the coloration of Sinosauropteryx reveals {{that it had a}} raccoon-like bandit mask and countershading patterns most likely associated with an open habitat, indicating that the Jehol likely had a range of habitat types.|$|E

25|$|The then current {{theory of}} colour held that white light was elementary, and that colours arose from {{mixtures}} <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark.</b> Newton criticised this theory {{by noting that}} in that case a printed page, with its juxtaposition <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark,</b> would look coloured. In folio 122 he recorded {{for the first time}} his notion that white light is heterogeneous and colour arise, not through the modification of a homogeneous white light, but from the separation of this mixture into its components. Newton also mentions Hooke's theory of colour, including his idea that it is a wave. Newton dismisses this theory with the remark that then light should bend around edges of objects as sounds does.|$|E

5000|$|In 2009, Ligon {{completed}} a short film entitled [...] "The Death of Tom." [...] It {{is based on}} Thomas Edison's 1903 silent film Uncle Tom's Cabin. Playing the character of Tom, Ligon had himself filmed re-creating the last scene of Edison's movie, from which he took his title. But the film was incorrectly loaded in the hand-crank camera that the artist used, so no imagery appeared on film. Embracing this apparent failure, Ligon decided to show his film as an abstract progression <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> <b>darks</b> with a narrative suggested by the score composed and played by jazz musician Jason Moran.|$|R

25|$|Some stylistic {{analyses}} {{consider the}} ultimate importance of Arnor is to {{stand as a}} literary device contrasting the southern kingdom of Gondor. Arguing that Arnor and Gondor {{are representative of the}} classical dichotomy <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark,</b> blessed and forsaken, good and evil - these analyses reference the abandonment by the heirs of Valandil and the absence of a White Tree as points of stylistic comparison to Gondor, with its fortresses and heavily populated capital city, its possession of a White Tree, and its well-equipped military and armaments.|$|E
25|$|In the double-slit experiment, as {{originally}} performed by Thomas Young and Augustin Fresnel in 1827, {{a beam of}} light is directed through two narrow, closely spaced slits, producing an interference pattern <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> bands on a screen. If one of the slits is covered up, one might naively expect that the intensity of the fringes due to interference would be halved everywhere. In fact, a much simpler pattern is seen, a simple diffraction pattern. Closing one slit results in a much simpler pattern diametrically opposite the open slit. Exactly the same behavior can be demonstrated in water waves, and so the double-slit experiment was seen as a demonstration of the wave nature of light.|$|E

25|$|In the 1930s, {{she began}} {{studying}} modern art through learning {{the components of}} composition, technique, and theory. This initial investigation into modern art formed her work {{throughout the rest of}} her career. She began taking classes from Hans Hofmann in 1937, which modernized her approach to the nude and still life. He emphasized the two-dimensional nature of the picture plane and usage of color to create spatial illusion that was not representative of reality through his lessons. Throughout her classes with Hofmann, Krasner worked in an advanced style of cubism, also known as neo-cubism. During the class, a human nude or a still life setting would be the model from which Krasner and other students would have to work. She typically created charcoal drawings of the human models and oil on paper color studies of the still life settings. She typically illustrated female nudes in a cubist manner with tension achieved through the fragmentation of forms and the opposition <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> colors. The still lifes illustrated her interest in fauvism since she suspended brightly colored pigment on white backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{modulation}} {{transfer function}} {{of an image}} intensifier {{is a measure of}} the output amplitude of dark and light lines on the display for a given level of input from lines presented to the photocathode at different resolutions. It is usually given as a percentage at a given frequency (spacing) <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> lines. For example, if you look at white and black lines with a MTF of 99% @ 2 lp/mm then the output of the dark and light lines is going to be 99% as dark or light as looking at a black image or a white image. This value decreases for a given increase in resolution also. On the same tube if the MTF at 16 and 32 lp/mm was 50% and 3% then at 16 lp/mm the signal would be only half as bright/dark as the lines were for 2 lp/mm and at 32 lp/mm the image of the lines would be only three percent as bright/dark as the lines were at 2 lp/mm.|$|E
25|$|The Gamma Cygni Nebula (IC 1318) {{includes}} both bright and dark nebulae {{in an area}} of over 4 degrees. DWB 87 is another of the many bright emission nebulae in Cygnus, 7.8 by 4.3 arcminutes. It is in the Gamma Cygni area. Two other emission nebulae include Sharpless 2-112 and Sharpless 2-115. When viewed in an amateur telescope, Sharpless 2–112 appears to be in a teardrop shape. More of the nebula's eastern portion is visible with an O III (doubly ionized oxygen) filter. There is an orange star of magnitude 10 nearby and a star of magnitude 9 near the nebula's northwest edge. Further to the northwest, there is a dark rift and another bright patch. The whole nebula measures 15 arcminutes in diameter. Sharpless 2–115 is another emission nebula with a complex pattern <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> patches. Two pairs of stars appear in the nebula; it is larger near the southwestern pair. The open cluster Berkeley 90 is embedded in this large nebula, which measures 30 by 20 arcminutes.|$|E

50|$|Ross {{makes the}} point that while point, line, mass, and color are {{important}} in every painting, for rapid plein air work one might be better off beginning with thumbnail “scribble” sketches and small two to four values studies using the biggest brush possible for the job. This “disegno” (design) becomes the blueprint for the painting and establishes the “macchia” (in the sense of the harmonious overall distribution <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> <b>darks).</b> Without a strong macchia structure the work will lack “impact” (the term used by the I Macchiaioli artists) for such an imprimatur (underpainting) that becomes the basis for the final work (either through wet into wet or wet into dry approaches).|$|R
25|$|If one {{illuminates}} {{two parallel}} slits, {{the light from}} the two slits again interferes. Here the interference is a more-pronounced pattern with a series <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> bands. The width of the bands is a property of the frequency of the illuminating light. (See the bottom photograph to the right.) When Thomas Young (1773–1829) first demonstrated this phenomenon, it indicated that light consists of waves, as the distribution of brightness {{can be explained by the}} alternately additive and subtractive interference of wavefronts. Young's experiment, performed in the early 1800s, played a vital part in the acceptance of the wave theory of light, vanquishing the corpuscular theory of light proposed by Isaac Newton, which had been the accepted model of light propagation in the 17th and 18th centuries. However, the later discovery of the photoelectric effect demonstrated that under different circumstances, light can behave as if it is composed of discrete particles. These seemingly contradictory discoveries made it necessary to go beyond classical physics and take the quantum nature of light into account.|$|E
25|$|Hopper's {{cinematic}} compositions {{and dramatic}} use <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> {{has made him}} a favorite among filmmakers. For example, House by the Railroad is reported to have heavily influenced the iconic house in the Alfred Hitchcock film Psycho. The same painting has also been cited as being an influence on the home in the Terrence Malick film Days of Heaven. The 1981 film Pennies from Heaven includes a tableau vivant of Nighthawks, with the lead actors in the places of the diners. German director Wim Wenders also cites Hopper influence. His 1997 film The End of Violence also incorporates a tableau vivant of Nighthawks, recreated by actors. Noted surrealist horror film director Dario Argento {{went so far as to}} recreate the diner and the patrons in Nighthawks as part of a set for his 1976 film Deep Red (aka Profondo Rosso). Ridley Scott has cited the same painting as a visual inspiration for Blade Runner. To establish the lighting of scenes in the 2002 film Road to Perdition, director Sam Mendes drew from the paintings of Hopper as a source of inspiration, particularly New York Movie.|$|E
25|$|By 1951, Krasner {{started her}} first series of collage paintings. To create these images, Krasner pasted cut and torn shapes onto {{all but two}} of the {{large-scale}} color field paintings she created for the Betty Parson's exhibition in 1951. This period marks the time when Krasner stopped working on an easel since she created these works by lying the support on the floor. To make these images, she would pin the separate pieces to a canvas and modify the composition until she was satisfied. She then would paste the fragments on the canvas and add color with a brush when desired. Most of the collage paintings she created recall plant or organic forms but do not completely resemble a living organism. By using many different materials, she was able to create texture and prevent the image from being entirely flat. The act of tearing and cutting elements for the collage embodies Krasner's expression since these acts are aggressive. She explored contrasts <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> colors, hard and soft lines, organic and geometric shapes, and structure and improvisation through these collages. These collage paintings represent Krasner's turn away from nonobjective abstraction. From this period onwards, she created metaphorical and content-laden art which alludes to organic figures or landscapes.|$|E
