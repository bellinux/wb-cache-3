40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> number <b>of</b> <b>falls,</b> {{and balance}} performance {{in women with}} FM and {{to examine the relationship}} between these variables and others, such as balance performance, quality of life, age, pain, and impact of fibromyalgia. Methods. A total of 240 women participated in this cross-sectional study. Of these, 125 had fibromyalgia. Several variables were assessed: age, fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> from 0 to 100, number <b>of</b> <b>falls,</b> body composition, balance performance, lower limb strength, health-related quality of life, and impact of fibromyalgia. Results. Women with fibromyalgia reported more falls and more fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> was associated with number <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> in the last year, stiffness, perceived balance problems, impact of FM, and HRQoL whereas the number <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> was related to fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> balance performance with eyes closed, pain, tenderness to touch level, anxiety, self-reported balance problems, impact of FM, and HRQoL. Conclusion. FM has an impact on fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> balance performance, and number <b>of</b> <b>falls.</b> Perceived balance problems seem to be more closely associated with fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> than objective balance performance...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{this pilot}} study {{we want to}} {{determine}} how often fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> occurs in geriatric patients visiting a fall clinic and to study the characteristics <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and its consequences.

40|$|Abstract Objective : To assess muscle mass, risk <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> {{and fear}} <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> in elderly adults with {{diabetic}} neuropathy (DNP). Methods : 50 elderly patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic neuropathy (NPD) {{participated in this}} study. Risk <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> was assessed by means <b>of</b> the <b>Falls</b> Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I). Muscle mass was assessed by tetrapolar bioimpedance analysis (BIA) and Janssen's equation. Subjects {{were divided into two}} groups: one with a history <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> in the six months before study enrollment (G 1) and the other without history <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> (G 2). Results : There were statistically significant differences between G 1 and G 2 regarding lean body mass (p < 0. 05), risk <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> as measured by the BBS (p < 0. 01), and fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> as measured by the FES-I (p < 0. 01). In addition, there was a significant correlation between the BBS and BIA (r = 0. 45 and p < 0. 01), showing that the greater the lean body mass, the lower the risk <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Conclusions : We found an association between lean mass, risk <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> and fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> in elderly adults with DNP and a history <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> from own height...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} experience with <b>falls,</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> perceptions <b>of</b> the consequences <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> and how the fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> affects daily life in community-dwelling older adults. Design: The study used a qualitative design to describe the lived experiences of community-dwelling older adults with the fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted individually with six participants who reported the fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Results: Five main areas emerged from data analysis: development of the fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> feared consequences <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> activities curtailment, fall prevention behavior and meaning of social support in daily life. The fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> was described as a negative experience, directly linked to fall consequences such as physical injury, incapacitation, loss of autonomy, fear of dependence and experience of humiliating conditions. To maintain a certain level of independence in daily life, the participants chose to avoid falls by activity curtailment, organizing their lives more carefully and getting support from others. Conclusion: All participants identified that they had discovered their fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> after experiencing <b>falls.</b> The fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> was associated with feared consequences <b>of</b> a potential <b>fall</b> and had an impact on their daily life.

40|$|Although fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> is {{a common}} and serious problem among elderly people, {{little is known about}} the risk factors {{associated}} with fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> among frail elderly persons in Japan. To assess the fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and investigate related factors, we conducted a study among 167 Japanese women aged 59 or older, who were receiving visiting nursing services. Fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> was measured by asking subjects about being afraid <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> (yes/no) and completing the Japanese version <b>of</b> <b>Falls</b> Efficacy Scale (FES). Fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> (being afraid <b>of</b> <b>falling)</b> was reported by 135 (80. 8 %) of the subjects. The overall FES score was significantly (p< 0. 01) lower in subjects who reported fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> (mean± standard deviation= 19. 8 ± 5. 5) than in those who did not (26. 1 ± 7. 2). The Japanese version of FES effectively identified persons having a fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Multiple linear regression analysis showed that palsy, incontinence, and falls during the past year were significantly associated with an increase in fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> (measured by FES). The present study suggests that fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> is common among elderly women receiving visiting nursing services. Preventive strategies to reduce fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and falls are needed, and would contribute to prevention of being bedridden and institutionalized for the frail elderly...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{examined}} falls self-efficacy and fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> {{to determine whether}} self-efficacy acts as a mediator between fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and functional ability. Methods:Using the Survey of Activities and Fear of Falling in the Elderly as a fear-of-falling measure and the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale for falls self-efficacy, structural relationships among fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> self-efficacy, functional balance, and physical functioning outcomes were tested with older adults (N = 256, M age = 77. 5). Results: Lower levels <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> {{were significantly related to}} higher levels <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> self-efficacy, which was in turn associated with better functional outcomes. Moreover, falls self-efficacymediated the effects <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> on func-tional outcomes. Discussion: Results substantiate the hypothesized mediational role <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> self-efficacy in fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and underscore the need to consider ways <b>of</b> enhancing <b>falls</b> self-efficacy in interventions aimed at reducing <b>falls</b> and fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Current research has focused on the following two approaches to the assessment <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> in the elderly (Lachman et al., 1998) : (a...|$|R

Method: cross-sectional and quantitative study with 240 elderly. Data were collected based on the social profile, through the instrument <b>of</b> risk <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> and assessment <b>of</b> <b>falls,</b> by univariate analysis, bivariate and multiple logistic regression. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19 was used for statistical analysis. Results: {{there was a significant}} association of the risk <b>of</b> <b>falls,</b> as measured by the Fall Risk Score, with sex (< 0. 001), age (0. 054), cognitive status (< 0. 001) and history <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> (< 0. 001). All variables were statistically significant and contributed to the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>falls.</b> In logistic regression, the variables that showed association with risk <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> were: fall, with whom they live, hypertension and visual impairment. Conclusion: female gender, older elderly (over 80 years old), with low cognitive status and occurrence <b>of</b> previous <b>falls</b> {{in the last six months}} are factors that increase the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>falls.</b> In logistic regression, the variables that were associated with risk <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> were: fall, with whom they live, visual impairment and rheumatologic diseases...|$|R

5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} the few New Zealand {{forest trees}} that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the {{protected}} rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay <b>of</b> <b>fallen</b> leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames.|$|E

Relatively little damage was recorded in Futuna; there, the storm downed several trees and stranded a yacht on a reef. On Niuafo'ou, a weather station recorded sustained winds of 55km/h (35mph) with gusts of up to 75km/h (45mph), along with a minimum pressure of 991hPa (mbar). Minor damage, consisting <b>of</b> <b>fallen</b> branches and isolated power outages also occurred on Niue.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: A fear <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> is {{widespread}} amongst older Australians. It {{increases the risk}} <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> {{and can lead to}} restriction of activity. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain insight into the precursors of a fear <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> and the experiences associated with this fear. Methods: Using a qualitative, phenomenological method, individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 9 community-based participants who reported moderate to high levels <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Results: Most participants did not fear falling until they had experienced a fall themselves. The fear <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> was described as a negative experience, often linked with incapacitation, fear of dependence and having to leave their home. Participants chose to avoid falls by ‘taking care’. Five themes emerged from data analysis: activity levels; view of the future; perceptions <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> experiences; fall avoidance; and development <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>falls.</b> Conclusions: The results indicated that factors other than a fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> resulted in a restriction of activities for these participants; therefore, it cannot be assumed that a fear <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> alone results in reduction of activity. Fear <b>of</b> <b>falls,</b> in combination with other potential issues that could restrict activities, should be taken into account in the development of fall-prevention programs in order to ensure clients’ needs are being met...|$|R

It alsoexamines the interrelationship between fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and multifactorial falls prevention interventions. Aliterature search of medical databases was conducted to identify articles that address the fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and multifactorial programs as either a primary or secondary component of their findings. Multifactorialinterventions were assessed {{in terms of their}} program content, design, demographics, implementationtechniques, and cost-effectiveness. Falls are a common, but preventable, cause of morbidity and injury inolder adults 65 and over. In addition to physiological variables, fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and self-efficacy arepsychosocial factors that impact the incidence <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> in this population. Addressing fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> inaddition to physiological parameters may influence the success <b>of</b> multifactorial <b>falls</b> prevention programsfor adults 65 and over...|$|R
