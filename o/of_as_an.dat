5|$|Continuing the {{tradition}} {{set by the}} first game, Wipeout 3 contains electronica offerings from various artists, including The Chemical Brothers, Orbital, and the Propellerheads. Psygnosis' development manager, Enda Carey, focused on bringing together music early in the game's development cycle, instead <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> afterthought or last-minute addition to the game. Unlike previous soundtracks, Psygnosis selected a single music director, DJ Sasha, who worked with artists to create a cohesive soundtrack. Sasha included several of his own tracks made specifically for the game. The game disc is a Mixed Mode CD that allows Wipeout 3s soundtrack to be played in a standard compact disc player. To promote Wipeout 3 and its game music, Psygnosis sponsored a Global Underground tour for Sasha. Game pods featuring Wipeout 3 were placed at parties and venues, accompanied by a tie-in marketing campaign.|$|E
5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can {{be thought}} <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{automated}} electronic log book. An ELD records the same information as a manual paper log book, and requires less input from the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper log book.|$|E
5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma is a {{physical}} substance that is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we do, think, or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E

5|$|Like {{several other}} chalk figures {{carved into the}} English countryside, the Cerne Abbas Giant is often thought <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ancient creation. However, as {{with many of the}} other figures, its history cannot be traced back further than the late 17th century, making an origin during the Celtic, Roman or even Early Medieval periods {{difficult}} to demonstrate. Medieval sources refer to the hill on which the giant is located as Trendle Hill – possibly in reference to the nearby landmark known as the Trendle. Joseph Bettey noted that none of the earlier sources for the area, including a detailed 1617 land survey, refer to the giant, suggesting that it might not have been there at the time. In contrast, the Uffington White Horse {{has been shown to be}} 3,000 years old, and there are references to it across the ages.|$|E
5|$|NY3 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY104A in Sterling. NY3 continues east to meet NY104 {{in the center}} of Hannibal. From there, NY3 progresses across Oswego County and passes Lake Neatahwanta prior to entering Fulton. Within Fulton, NY3 intersects NY48 on {{the west bank of the}} Oswego River before crossing the river and meeting NY481 at the eastern bank. East of the city, NY3 passes south of the Oswego County Airport as it heads to the northeast through Palermo. Upon intersecting NY264, NY3 becomes signed as a north–south highway instead <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> east–west route. It proceeds north to the village of Mexico, where it meets NY104 once again. NY3 and NY104 overlap briefly through the western portion of the village before separating at the center of Mexico. While NY104 heads east toward Williamstown, NY3 heads north toward the hamlet of Texas.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} age of the figure are unclear. It is often thought <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ancient construction, though the {{earliest}} mention of it dates to the late 17th century. Early antiquarians associated it, on little evidence, with a Saxon deity, while other scholars sought to identify it with a Celtic British figure of the Greek Hercules or some syncretization of the two. Archaeological evidence that parts of the drawing have been lost over time strengthen the Hercules identification. The lack of earlier descriptions leads some modern scholars to conclude that it probably dates from the 17th century, and perhaps originated as political satire.|$|E

25|$|In {{computer}} science, heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort can {{be thought}} <b>of</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> improved selection sort: like that algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region.
