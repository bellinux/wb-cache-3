5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{treatments}} for malaria (and <b>other</b> <b>diseases)</b> included blood-letting, inducing vomiting, limb amputations and trepanning. Physicians and surgeons {{in the period}} used herbal medicines like Belladonna to bring about pain relief in afflicted patients.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{endocrine}} diseases involve dysfunctions of the adrenal gland. Overproduction of cortisol leads to Cushing's syndrome, whereas insufficient production {{is associated with}} Addison's disease. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms. A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal tissue and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for <b>other</b> <b>diseases.</b>|$|E
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} can manifest {{similarly to}} <b>other</b> <b>diseases,</b> {{which must be}} ruled out when making a diagnosis. These include tuberous sclerosis, which causes skin lesions similar to fibrofolliculomas, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease, which causes hereditary kidney cancers. Once diagnosed, people with BHD are treated preventatively, with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging. Fibrofolliculomas can be removed surgically and pneumothorax and kidney cancer are treated according to the normal standard of care.|$|E

5|$|If {{there is}} {{doubt about the}} cause of the skin lesions, a biopsy of the skin may be {{performed}} to distinguish the purpura from <b>other</b> <b>diseases</b> that cause it, such as vasculitis due to cryoglobulinemia; on microscopy the appearances are of a hypersensitivity vasculitis, and immunofluorescence demonstrates IgA and C3 (a protein of the complement system) in the blood vessel wall.

5|$|In 1971–72, {{he wrote}} four books, most notably, Genes, Dreams and Realities, which caused great {{controversy}} {{due to its}} strident attacks on molecular biology, cellular biology, and claims that cancer and various <b>other</b> <b>diseases</b> were incurable {{and that it was}} pointless to try to do so. He also predicted that scientific progress would end soon.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 Mathews {{relocated}} to Seattle, Washington, {{to work for}} the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the largest philanthropic organization in the United States, as an executive vice president. The following year, she became chief operating officer of the Foundation. The Foundation reorganized in 2006, naming Mathews president of the Foundation's Global Development Program. Mathews was involved in awarding grants to improve health outcomes in the developing world, including stopping the spread of HIV and <b>other</b> <b>diseases</b> and making contraception more readily available.|$|E

5|$|Neuropsychological tests {{such as the}} mini–mental state {{examination}} (MMSE) are widely {{used to evaluate the}} cognitive impairments needed for diagnosis. More comprehensive test arrays are necessary for high reliability of results, particularly in the earliest stages of the disease. Neurological examination in early AD will usually provide normal results, except for obvious cognitive impairment, which may not differ from that resulting from <b>other</b> <b>diseases</b> processes, including other causes of dementia.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} {{diseases}} of humans {{that were found}} to be caused by viruses in the 20th century one, smallpox, has been eradicated. The diseases caused by viruses such as HIV and influenza virus have proved to be more difficult to control. <b>Other</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as those caused by arboviruses, are presenting new challenges.|$|E
5|$|Prions are {{infectious}} agents composed {{entirely of}} a protein material that can fold in multiple, structurally abstract ways, {{at least one}} of which is transmissible to other prion proteins, leading to disease {{in a manner that is}} epidemiologically comparable to the spread of viral infection. Prions composed of the prion protein (PrP) are believed to be the cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) among <b>other</b> <b>diseases.</b>|$|E

5|$|Though fibrofolliculomas {{are unique}} to Birt–Hogg–Dubé, they may present with an {{ambiguous}} appearance and must be confirmed histologically. <b>Other</b> <b>diseases</b> can mimic the dermatologic manifestations of BHD, including tuberous sclerosis complex, Cowden syndrome, familial trichoepitheliomas, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Tuberous sclerosis must be distinguished because both disorders can present with angiofibromas on the face, though they are more common in tuberous sclerosis.|$|E
5|$|A French {{military}} flying column then marched toward Antananarivo, losing {{many men}} to malaria and <b>other</b> <b>diseases.</b> Reinforcements came from Algeria and Sub-Saharan Africa. Upon reaching {{the city in}} September 1895, the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, causing heavy casualties and leading Queen Ranavalona III to surrender. France annexed Madagascar in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year, dissolving the Merina monarchy and sending the royal family into exile on Réunion Island and to Algeria. A two-year resistance movement organized {{in response to the}} French capture of the royal palace was effectively put {{down at the end of}} 1897.|$|E
5|$|Although plague was known, it {{was still}} {{sufficiently}} uncommon that medical practitioners might have had no personal experience of seeing the disease; medical training varied from those who had attended the college of physicians, to apothecaries who also acted as modern doctors, to simple charlatans. <b>Other</b> <b>diseases</b> abounded, such as an outbreak of smallpox the year before, and these uncertainties all added to difficulties identifying the true start of the epidemic. Contemporary accounts suggest cases of plague occurred through the winter of 1664/5, {{some of which were}} fatal but a number of which did not display the virulence of the later epidemic. The winter was cold, the ground frozen from December to March, river traffic on the Thames twice blocked by ice, {{and it may be that}} the cold weather held back its spread.|$|E

5|$|Copper {{reduction}} or deficiency {{can also}} be deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes by the compound ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, in which the bright red anion tetrathiomolybdate is the copper-chelating agent. Tetrathiomolybdate was first used therapeutically {{in the treatment of}} copper toxicosis in animals. It was then introduced as a treatment in Wilson's disease, a hereditary copper metabolism disorder in humans; it acts both by competing with copper absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion. It has also been found to have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis, potentially by inhibiting the membrane translocation process that is dependent on copper ions. This is a promising avenue for investigation of treatments for cancer, age-related macular degeneration, and <b>other</b> <b>diseases</b> that involve a pathologic proliferation of blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Examples {{of common}} human {{diseases}} caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores. Many serious {{diseases such as}} Ebola virus disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is {{described in terms of}} virulence. <b>Other</b> <b>diseases</b> are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E
5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in {{the differential diagnosis}} of AD and <b>other</b> <b>diseases.</b> Interviews with family members are also utilised {{in the assessment of}} the disease. Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, {{as well as on the}} decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.|$|E
