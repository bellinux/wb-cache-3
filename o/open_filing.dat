5000|$|An <b>open</b> <b>file</b> in chess is a {{file with}} no pawns of either color on it. [...] In the diagram, the e-file is an <b>open</b> <b>file.</b> An <b>open</b> <b>file</b> {{can provide a}} line of attack for a rook or queen. Having rooks or queens on <b>open</b> <b>files</b> or half-open files is {{considered}} advantageous, as it allows a player to attack more easily, since a rook or queen can move down the file to penetrate the opponent's position.|$|R

5000|$|A common {{strategic}} objective for a rook or queen on an <b>open</b> <b>file</b> {{is to reach}} its seventh or eighth rank (or for Black, its second or first rank). Controlling the seventh rank (or second rank for Black) is generally worth at least a pawn, {{as most of the}} opponent's pawns will usually reside there. Aron Nimzowitsch first recognized the power of a major piece on an <b>open</b> <b>file,</b> writing in his famous book My System that the main objective of a rook or queen on an <b>open</b> <b>file</b> is [...] "the eventual occupation of the 7th or 8th rank." ...|$|R

50|$|JFS uses Allocation groups. Allocation groups {{divide the}} {{aggregate}} space into chunks. This allows JFS to use resource allocation policies to achieve great I/O performance. The first {{policy is to}} try to cluster disk blocks and disk inodes for related data in the same AG in order to achieve good locality for the disk. The second policy is to distribute unrelated data throughout the file system in an attempt to minimize free-space fragmentation. When there is an <b>open</b> <b>file</b> JFS will lock the AG the file resides in and only allow the <b>open</b> <b>file</b> to grow. This reduces fragmentation as only the <b>open</b> <b>file</b> can write to the AG.|$|R
