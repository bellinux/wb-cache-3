[...] He was appointed to two committees: finance and ordinances. He became known for his work revising and updating city ordinances, and by 1884, after having been re-elected twice, he was named chairman of the ordinances committee. Wharton also became known for being fiscally prudent while serving on the finance committee; for example, he disapproved of granting pay raises to city <b>officials,</b> <b>saying</b> he believed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> making a sufficient amount of money already. [...] Wharton was well-regarded by the city's political establishment: the Boston Herald praised his work on the council, saying he had become [...] "one of the most influential members of the lower branch of the city government." [...] Subsequently, Wharton continued to move up in Massachusetts politics, getting elected to the House of Representatives in 1885. He served there until 1888, becoming the chairman of the rules committee as well as working on issues related to the railroads.|$|R
50|$|Mark Weisbrot says that, in {{more recent}} years, Argentina under former President Néstor Kirchner made a break with the Consensus and that {{this led to a}} {{significant}} improvement in its economy; some add that Ecuador may soon follow suit. However, while Kirchner's reliance on price controls and similar administrative measures (often aimed primarily at foreign-invested firms such as utilities) clearly ran counter to the spirit of the Consensus, his administration in fact ran an extremely tight fiscal ship and maintained a highly competitive floating exchange rate; Argentina's immediate bounce-back from crisis, further aided by abrogating its debts and a fortuitous boom in prices of primary commodities, leaves open issues of longer-term sustainability.The Economist has argued that the Néstor Kirchner administration will end up as one more in Argentina's long history of populist governments. In October 2008, Kirchner's wife and successor as President, Cristina Kirchner, announced her government's intention to nationalize pension funds from the privatized system implemented by Menem-Cavallo. Accusations have emerged of the manipulation of official statistics under the Kirchners (most notoriously, for inflation) to create an inaccurately positive picture of economic performance. The Economist removed Argentina's inflation measure from its <b>official</b> indicators, <b>saying</b> that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> no longer reliable.|$|R
