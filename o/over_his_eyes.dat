5|$|Critchlow himself {{appears in}} a number of Thrud strips, {{occasionally}} as a narrator although more often as a drinking companion for Thrud. Critchlow depicts himself with lank hair and a large cap pulled down low <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{bartender}} {{is working}} at a saloon, serving drinks to customers. After he fills a stereotypically Irish man's bucket with beer, Carrie Nation and her followers burst inside. They assault the Irish man, pulling his hat <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and then dumping the beer over his head. The group then begin wrecking the bar, smashing the fixtures, mirrors, and breaking the cash register. The bartender then sprays seltzer water in Nation's face before a group of policemen appear and order everybody to leave.|$|E
5|$|TK is {{a mysterious}} {{character}} {{who wears a}} large bandanna <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and tends to break out in dance every so often. No one knows his real name or past. He speaks in semi-nonsensical English phrases depending on the situation, mainly quoted from pop culture, but apparently does not know English fluently. He saves the team many times and does know some Japanese but rarely speaks it. He carries Browning Hi-Power and LAR Grizzly handguns or a PP-19 Bizon submachine gun during missions.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, {{the team}} was not {{announced}} at the scheduled time due to the delay caused by the veto. Journalists deduced the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for many weeks, missing all the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as {{to the nature of}} his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship regarding Barnes's behaviour was deposited in the NSWCA library. It accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by cupping his hands <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and showing dissent by implying that they were blind.|$|E
5|$|According to Noon, talk had {{circulated}} about adding extra {{characters that}} {{were not in the}} film. As the Sheng Long hoax and Akuma's debut in Super Street Fighter II Turbo were fairly recent at the time, the designers asked for Capcom's permission to add both characters into the game. Capcom approved the addition of Akuma, but denied the inclusion of Sheng Long. However, Capcom later unexpectedly approved the addition of Sheng Long. Noon designed Sheng Long's appearance for the title, giving him black gi pants and a long, green, padded/quilted, sleeveless Gi style top which was tied off with a black beltmandarin style, long white braided hair, Fu Manchu moustache, a thick black ribbon <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> due to being blinded by Akuma and one hand taking the form of a dragon's claw, described {{as a result of his}} power being so advanced, that he began to physically manifest dragon like attributes. Capcom approved the design, and Luis Mangubat an artist from the development team posed as Sheng Long. However, the character was left unfinished because of time constraints.|$|E
25|$|Children's {{television}} host Chuck McCann became {{well known}} in the New York/New Jersey market for his imitations of newspaper comic characters; McCann put blank white circles <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> during his over-the-top impression of Annie.|$|E

25|$|The Rock brothers, {{who already}} {{controlled}} an {{operation in the}} Bronx, refused to buy from Noe and Schultz. However, the Rock brothers underestimated the newcomers. Eventually, the elder brother, John Rock, agreed to cooperate, but younger brother Joe refused. One night the Noe-Schultz gang kidnapped him. They beat him and hung him by his thumbs from a meat hook and then allegedly wrapped a gauze bandage smeared with discharge from a gonorrhea infection <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> His family reportedly paid $35,000 and he was released. Shortly after his return, he went blind. From then on, the Noe-Schultz gang met little opposition as they expanded to control the beer supply for the entire Bronx.|$|E
25|$|Only in {{his early}} thirties, Captain Schofield is renowned for his level-headed {{demeanor}} and reflexes that afford him the ability {{to come out of}} devastating conflict alive. His callsign comes from two vertical scars that run from his eyebrows to his cheeks, <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> wounds he sustained while he was a Harrier pilot for the Marine Corps in Serbia. Although his rank is well below many others in the story, he frequently takes command of the entire United States military; the President personally agreeing to this due to Schofield having saved his life the preceding year. Often resorting to very dangerous strategies to win a battle, it has become the norm for any attempt on his life to end with him escaping while the surrounding environment is more or less demolished. He commands a recon unit of Marines called to aid the Russian government - a trap designed to lead to his death. Upon discovering M-12's plot to change world order, he embarks upon a campaign to ruin the Chameleon and Kormoran projects. He is the protagonist in four Matthew Reilly novels and a novella, Scarecrow being the third novel.|$|E
500|$|Washington, {{with his}} hat in his hand, rode forward and waved the Americans forward, while he rode ahead on his horse. At this point, Mawhood had moved his troops {{slightly}} to the left {{to get out of}} the range of the American artillery fire. Washington gave orders not to fire until he gave them the signal, and when they were thirty yards away, he turned around on his horse, facing his men and said [...] "Halt!" [...] and then [...] "Fire!". At this moment, the British also fired, obscuring the field in a cloud of smoke. One of Washington's officers, John Fitzgerald, pulled his hat <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to avoid seeing Washington killed, but when the smoke cleared, Washington appeared, unharmed, waving his men forward.|$|E
50|$|Bastress {{made his}} debut on October 15, 2011 at Bellator 54 against Daniel Gracie. Bastress won {{when the doctor}} deemed Gracie unable to {{continue}} due to a cut <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{at the end of}} the second round.|$|R
60|$|Elliott arose {{to carry}} out the order, and had pulled in the deer-hide flaps, when one of them was jerked outward to {{disclose}} the befrilled person of Jim Girty. Except for a discoloration <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> he appeared as usual.|$|R
60|$|The short {{interlude}} {{of passion}} was <b>over.</b> <b>His</b> <b>eye</b> had accidentally rested {{for one second}} on the leather wallet, which she still held tightly clutched, and all thoughts of her beauty, of his power or his desires, had flown out to the winds.|$|R
500|$|Presley {{made his}} {{third and final}} Ed Sullivan Show {{appearance}} on January 6, 1957—on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist. Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity. In any event, as critic Greil Marcus describes, Presley [...] "did not tie himself down. Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn {{on the first two}} shows, he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out." [...] To close, displaying his range and defying Sullivan's wishes, Presley sang a gentle black spiritual, [...] "Peace in the Valley". At the end of the show, Sullivan declared Presley [...] "a real decent, fine boy".|$|E
500|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Wither", Oliver and Lois attend a costumed ball, where Oliver dresses up as Robin Hood. The {{designers}} decided to model Oliver's costume after {{the comic book}} character Green Arrow. Costume designer Caroline Cranstoun designed Oliver's official Green Arrow costume in conjunction with illustrator Andy Poon. To hide his face, Green Arrow typically wears a mask <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> but Cranstoun and Keith Christensen, of Ocean Drive Leather, opted to use a hood {{and a pair of}} dark sunglasses to hide Oliver's face. Cranstoun revealed that Miles Millar was the one {{who came up with the}} hood idea. The costume is also made entirely out of leather, as the creative team wanted to keep away from using tights. Hartley was very impressed with the costume, but confessed that it was uncomfortable to wear because it had layers of leather, and he had to wear boots with four inch lifts.|$|E
500|$|Dougan {{was signed}} by Aston Villa in July 1961 for a fee of £15,000. He {{was signed by}} manager Joe Mercer as a {{replacement}} for Gerry Hitchens, who had been sold on to Inter Milan earlier in the summer for £85,000. Teammate Peter McParland later commented that [...] "when Derek came to us at Aston Villa I think it was {{at a time when he}} was not taking the game particularly seriously". After returning from watching his [...] "Villans" [...] teammates win the 1961 League Cup Final at Villa Park on 5 September, Dougan was a passenger in a car accident which killed fellow passenger Malcolm Williams and left Dougan with a broken arm and head injuries; driver and teammate Bobby Thomson was charged but found 'Not Guilty' of careless driving. In November 2010 – three years after Dougan's death, Thomson claimed that Dougan had drunkenly pulled a deerstalker hat <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> causing him to crash the car. Dougan recovered after three months on the sidelines and ended the 1961–62 season with 12 goals in 27 matches. He twisted his knee midway through the 1962–63 campaign after slipping in the street, and ended the season with 14 goals from 33 games.|$|E
60|$|They {{descended the}} steps in silence, and Jacob drew a little breath of relief {{as they entered the}} boat. Montague was sitting upon the sands with both hands pressed <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> as they landed. He shrank back when he saw Jacob.|$|R

500|$|It {{was while}} Harris was remonstrating with Gregory that [...] "larrikins" [...] {{in the crowd}} surged onto the pitch. A young Banjo Paterson, who later went on to write the iconic Australian bush ballad [...] "Waltzing Matilda", was among the pitch invaders. Of the 10,000 spectators, up to 2,000 [...] "participated in the disorder".On 10 February, the Sydney Morning Herald {{described}} the number of riot participants as [...] "not more than 2,000, at the outside, who took an active art in the disorder". [...] On 31 May, following the publication of Harris's letter, The Argus described a significantly lesser figure, editorialising that [...] "only a few hundred sided with the objectors. [...] Those that were actively violent were fewer still, and they were kept in check by the better-disposed of the crowd." [...] Coulthard was jostled and Lord Harris, who {{had returned to the}} field to support Coulthard, was struck by a whip or stick but was not hurt. [...] Hornby, a keen amateur boxer who had been offered the English captaincy before stepping aside for Harris, grabbed his captain's assailant and [...] "conveyed his prisoner to the pavilion in triumph"; it was later said that he had caught the wrong man. [...] Hornby was also attacked and almost lost the shirt off his back. [...] Emmett and Ulyett each took a stump for protection and escorted Lord Harris off, assisted by some members. [...] In the meantime, the crowd anger grew and there was mounting fear that the riot would intensify, due to speculation that the crowd would try to free Hornby's captive. However, there was only jostling as the players were evacuated into the pavilion, and the injuries were limited to minor cuts and bruises. [...] An English naval captain who was at the ground had his top hat pulled <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and was verbally abused by some spectators. [...] After 30 minutes, the field was cleared.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the visual}} arts, this fashionable {{intellectual}} melancholy occurs frequently in portraiture of the era, with sitters posed {{in the form}} of [...] "the lover, with his crossed arms and floppy hat <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and the scholar, sitting with his head resting on his hand"—descriptions drawn from the frontispiece to the 1638 edition of Burton's Anatomy, which shows just such by-then stock characters. These portraits were often set out of doors where Nature provides [...] "the most suitable background for spiritual contemplation" [...] or in a gloomy interior.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Cannister {{stood up}} and touched <b>his</b> {{forehead}} <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> with <b>his</b> finger, in respectful salutation of Elfride, gave half as much salute to Stephen (whom he, in common with other villagers, had never for a moment recognized), then sat down again and resumed his discourse.|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} Wiarton Willie {{lived to}} the advanced age of 22, {{and was found}} dead only two days before Groundhog Day in 1999. The organizers were {{unable to find a}} replacement, and instead marked Groundhog Day by revealing [...] "Willie" [...] in a coffin. He had been dressed in a tuxedo, had coins <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and a carrot between his paws. The real Willie had in fact decomposed, and the body in the coffin was that of an older, stuffed groundhog. The Associated Press was obliged to issue a retraction on its wires.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{man himself}} was more {{entertaining}} than the printed page. To sit {{beside him in}} the pavilion at Lords' or in the Old Stagers enclosure at Canterbury was to see cricket as it was played in the golden days". At Lords he was always to be seen on match days at the 'Knatchbull's corner [...] - {{the place of the}} Four-in-Hand Club – with his friends John Lorraine Baldwin, Sir Spencer Ponsonby Fane, Earl of Bessborough and Robert Grimston.` The famous old cricketer, with his hat drawn <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and his burly physique set a figure that always arrested attention.|$|E
2500|$|The Spanish colonized {{near the}} Rio Grande and, because the Hopi {{did not live}} near rivers that gave access to the Río Grande, the Spanish never left any troops on their land. The Spanish were {{accompanied}} by missionaries, Catholic friars. Beginning in 1629, {{with the arrival of}} 30 friars in Hopi country, the Franciscan Period started. [...] The Franciscans had missionaries assigned and built a church at Awatovi. The Hopi originally were against conversion to Catholicism. [...] After an incident where Father Porras purportedly restored the sight of a blind youth by placing a cross <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> the Hopi at Awatovi believed in Christianity. Most Hopi in the other villages continued to resist conversion, wanting to maintain their own ways.|$|E
