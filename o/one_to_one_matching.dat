Firstly Due to the inferiority of image registration using maximum mutual information, the registration based on local curvature maximum to obtain corner points. Secondly, the <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>matching</b> points {{could be obtained}} through mutual information rough match. Finally, the search strategy used the improved genetic algorithm to find the optimum value. Experimental results indicate the proposed algorithm can achieve better accuracy and good robust...|$|E
40|$|National audienceEstimating the {{similarity}} of two protein structures {{is a very important}} task in biology. It is usually based on an alignment, i. e. a <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>matching</b> between the amino-acids of each protein. Between all the methods for aligning proteins we are interested in VAST, which first aligns the secondary structures (SSE) and then extends this alignment to the amino-acids. The SSEs alignment is presented as a maximum clique problem in a particular graph. In this paper we propose a new integer programming model for various maximum weight clique problems and we successfully applied it in VAST...|$|E

However performance improvement of biometric based verification system is an interesting and emerging area. In fingerprint verification systems, there are usually multiple enrolled impressions for a same finger. The performance of the systems can be improved by combining these impressions at enrollment level as well as testing level. In this research paper we use a method of score level fusion using multiple enrollment and multiple testing impressions to achieve higher accuracy. Experimental results show that a larger improvement {{can be obtained by}} using fusion of multiple enrollments and one testing impression scheme than other <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>matching.</b> Experiment conducted with FVC 2000, FVC 2002 and our own (BAMU) database.

50|$|To be more precisely, the {{relation}} of agent and subject {{is not a simple}} <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>match.</b> Here, the term subject denotes a process-related functionality and agent denotes a real thing or instance (i.e. a concrete realisation of a subject). This is important, because subjects have to be matched with organisational structures (i.e. the ressources of an organisation, such as people or machines). This differentiation is therefore important in the context of concrete implementations of the S-BPM methodology in organisation - with or without the support of information technology. On the other side, the term agent has many meanings in different domains, e.g. in economics, linguistics, social sciences or computer science. Sometimes the term actor is synonymously used. Care must be taken, not to mix up different meanings.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{people are}} {{interested}} in using digital images. So the size of the image database is increasing enormously. Lot of interest is paid to find images in the database. There is a great need for developing an efficient technique for finding the images. In order to find an image, image has to be represented with certain features. Color and texture are two important visual features of an image. So, an efficient image retrieval technique which uses local color and texture features is proposed. An image is partitioned into sub-blocks of equal size as a first step. Color of each sub-block is extracted by quantifying the HSV color space into non-equal intervals and the color feature is represented by cumulative histogram. Texture of each sub-block is obtained by using gray level cooccurrence matrix. A <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>matching</b> scheme is used to compare the query and target image. Euclidean distance is used in retrieving the similar images. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated with the results...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the lack}} of {{relationships}} between matching line and adjacent lines in the process of individual line matching, and the weak reliability of the individual line descriptor facing on discontinue texture, this paper presents a reliable line matching algorithm for stereo images with topological relationship. The algorithm firstly generates grouped line pairs from lines extracted from the reference image and searching image according to the basic topological relationships such as distance and angle between the lines. Then it takes the grouped line pairs as matching primitives, and matches these grouped line pairs by using epipolar constraint, homography constraint, quadrant constraint and gray correlation constraint of irregular triangle in order. And finally, it resolves the corresponding line pairs into two pairs of corresponding individual lines, and obtains <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>matching</b> results after the post-processing of integrating, fitting, and checking. This paper adopts digital aerial images and close-range images with typical texture features to deal with the parameter analysis and line matching, and the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm in this paper can obtain reliable line matching results...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} pattern of intra-operative blood loss at various {{surgical}} stages comparing between single and two surgeons. Methods: Lenke 1 and 2 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients who underwent instrumented posterior spinal fusion (PSF) surgery from two centres between June 2014 and December 2015 were prospectively recruited into this study. The patients were grouped into Group 1 (single surgeon) and Group 2 (two surgeons). <b>One</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>matching</b> using ‘prospective propensity score-matched cohort patient sampling method’ was done. The surgery was divided into six stages: stage 1 —exposure, stage 2 —screw insertion, stage 3 —release, stage 4 —correction, stage 5 —corticotomies and bone grafting and stage 6 —closure. Results: A total of 116 patients were recruited. Of 86 patients who were operated by the two surgeons, 30 patients were matched with 30 patients that were operated by a single surgeon. Operation duration was significantly longer in Group 1 (257. 3 ± 51. 4 min) compared to Group 2 (164. 0 ± 25. 7 min). The total blood loss was significantly higher in Group 1 (1254. 7 ± 521. 5 mL) compared to Group 2 (893. 7 ± 518. 4 mL). Total blood loss/level fused was significantly higher in Group 1 (117. 5 ± 42. 8 mL/level) compared to Group 2 (82. 6 ± 39. 4 mL/level). Group 1 had significantly higher blood loss and blood loss/level fused for stages 1, 2 and 3. Group 2 had lower incidence of allogenic blood transfusion. Conclusions: In PSF surgery for AIS patients, two-surgeon strategy was associated with shorter operation duration, lesser blood loss and lower incidence of allogenic blood transfusion...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the impact of angiosome targeted revascularization according to the revascularization method. DesignRetrospective observational study. Materials and methodsThis study cohort comprised 744 consecutive patients who underwent infrapopliteal endovascular or surgical revascularization between January 2010 and July 2013. Differences in outcomes after bypass surgery and PTA were adjusted by estimating a propensity score, which was employed for <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>matching</b> as well as adjusted analysis. ResultsCox proportional hazards analysis showed that angiosome-targeted revascularization (HR 1. 29, 95 % CI 1. 02 – 1. 65), bypass surgery (HR 1. 79, 95 % CI 1. 41 – 2. 27), C-reactive protein ≤ 10  mg/dL (HR 1. 42, 95 % CI 1. 11 – 1. 81), and the number of affected angiosomes (HR 0. 85, 95 % CI 0. 74 – 0. 98) were independent predictors of improved wound healing. When adjusted for the number of affected angiosomes and C-reactive protein ≤ 10  mg/dL, angiosome-targeted bypass surgery was associated with a significantly higher rate of wound healing than non-angiosome-targeted angioplasty (HR 2. 27, 95 % CI 1. 61 – 3. 20). This was confirmed in propensity score adjusted analysis (HR 1. 72, 95 % CI 1. 35 – 2. 16). Among patients who underwent angiosome-targeted revascularization, the propensity score adjusted analysis showed that bypass surgery was associated with a significantly better rate of wound healing (HR 154, 95 % CI 1. 09 – 2. 16) but similar limb salvage rates when compared with angioplasty (HR 0. 79, 95 % CI 0. 44 – 1. 43). ConclusionRates of wound healing and limb salvage in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) were significantly better after angiosome-targeted revascularization, bypass surgery achieving significantly better wound healing than angioplasty...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} every linear optical {{component}} can be completely {{described as a}} device that converts one set of orthogonal input modes, <b>one</b> by <b>one,</b> <b>to</b> a <b>matching</b> set of orthogonal output modes. This result holds for any linear optical structure with any specific variation in space and/or time of its structure. There are therefore preferred orthogonal "mode converter" basis sets of input and output functions for describing any linear optical device, in terms of which the device can be described by a simple diagonal operator. This result should help us understand what linear optical devices we can and cannot make. As illustrations, we use this approach to derive a general expression for the alignment tolerance of an efficient mode coupler and to prove that loss-less combining of orthogonal modes is impossible...|$|R
40|$|Propensity score {{matching}} is {{a prominent}} strategy to reduce imbalance in observational studies. However, if imbalance is considerable {{and the control}} reservoir is small, either <b>one</b> has <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>one</b> control <b>to</b> several treated units or, alternatively, discard many treated persons. The first strategy tends to increase standard errors of the estimated treatment effects while the second might produce a matched sample that is not anymore representative of the original one. As an alternative approach, this paper argues to carefully reconsider the selection equation upon which the propensity score estimates are based. Often, all available variables that rule the selection process are included into the selection equation. Yet, it would suffice to concentrate on only those exhibiting a large impact on the outcome under scrutiny, as well. This would introduce more stochastic noise making treatment and comparison group more similar. We assess {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the latter approach in a simulation study...|$|R
40|$|The clinicopathological {{heterogeneity}} of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) currently precludes an accurate diagnosis, {{which in turn}} impacts the identification of biomarkers for targeted therapeutics. Revised diagnostic criteria now recognise four clinical phenotypes, including the behavioural variant FTD, and three primary progressive aphasia variants (semantic, non-fluent and logopenic). Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) encompasses the major pathological substrates of these clinical syndromes, although a <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> clinicopathological <b>match</b> is rare. This issue is further compounded {{by the presence of}} alternate pathological as well as clinical syndromes such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which contaminate the clinical and pathological cohorts of FTD/FTLD. In this thesis, a large cohort of neuropathologically-ascertained FTD cases was assessed from a clinically relevant standpoint {{in order to understand the}} aspects that contribute to this heterogeneity and subsequently simplify the complicated picture of this spectrum of diseases. The background of FTD and associated disorders is covered in Chapter 1, followed by the general experimental design used (Chapter 2). Chapter 3 validated the updated clinical diagnostic criteria for the four variants of FTD, and Chapter 4 followed on from these findings to identify discriminatory features between these syndromes as well as those with clinical FTD but atypical pathology (AD). Chapter 5 identified clearly separable clinicopathological entities and assessed the presence of a clinical continuums within the major pathological FTLD groups, tau and TDP. The results of Chapter 6 found a set of further clinical features that assist in discriminating FTD mimics; vascular risk factors identify pathological AD in clinical FTD cohorts and family history and genetic factors assist in anticipating pathological FTLD in clinical AD cohorts. The detailed analysis of the clinical and pathological heterogeneity that underlies the FTD spectrum of diseases studied in this thesis will facilitate early and accurate diagnoses. Furthermore, the novel approach in clinicopathological assessments of this disease, clarify the complex pathological basis of this disease and will be beneficial for directing future biomarker studies for therapeutics...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a new {{sequence}} {{matching algorithm}} called as Exemplary Sequence Cardinality (ESC) is proposed. ESC combines several abilities of other sequence matching algo- rithms e. g. DTW, SSDTW, CDP, FSM, MVM, OSB 1. Depending {{on the application}} domain, ESC can be tuned to behave such as these different sequence matching algorithms. Its generality and robustness comes from its ability to find subsequences (as in CDP and SSDTW), to skip outliers inside the target sequences (as in MVM) {{and also in the}} query sequence (as in OSB) and it has the ability <b>to</b> have many <b>to</b> <b>one</b> and <b>one</b> <b>to</b> many correspondences (as in DTW) between the elements of the query and the target sequences. In case of word spotting application, the outliers skipping capability of ESC makes it less sensible to local variations in the spelling of words, and also to noise present in the query and/or in the target word images. Due to it’s capability of sub-sequence matching, the ESC algorithm has the ability to retrieve a query inside a line or piece of line. Finally, its multiple <b>matching</b> facilities (many <b>to</b> <b>one</b> and <b>one</b> <b>to</b> many <b>matching)</b> is proven to be well advantageous in case of different length of target and query sequences due to the variability in scale, font, type/size factors. During experiments, we show the interest of proposed ESC algorithm for the task of word spotting in historical document images in specific cases when incorrect word segmentation and word level local variations occur regularly...|$|R
30|$|Scans {{acquired}} by 3 D sensors are typically represented {{in a local}} coordinate system. When multiple scans, taken from different locations, represent the same scene these must be registered to a common reference frame. We propose a fast and robust registration approach to automatically align two scans by finding two sets of N-points, that are approximately congruent under rigid transformation and leading to a good estimate of the transformation between their corresponding point clouds. Given two scans, our algorithm randomly searches for the best sets of congruent groups of points using a RANSAC-based approach. To successfully and reliably align two scans when {{there is only a}} small overlap, we improve the basic RANSAC random selection step by employing a weight function that approximates the probability of each pair of points in <b>one</b> scan <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>one</b> pair in the other. The search time to find pairs of congruent sets of N-points is greatly reduced by employing a fast search codebook based on both binary and multi-dimensional lookup tables. Moreover, we introduce a novel indicator of the overlapping region quality which is used to verify the estimated rigid transformation and to improve the alignment robustness. Our framework is general enough to incorporate and efficiently combine different point descriptors derived from geometric and texture-based feature points or scene geometrical characteristics. We also present a method to improve the matching effectiveness of texture feature descriptors by extracting them from an atlas of rectified images recovered from the scan reflectance image. Our algorithm is robust with respect to different sampling densities and also resilient to noise and outliers. We demonstrate its robustness and efficiency on several challenging scan datasets with varying degree of noise, outliers, extent of overlap, acquired from indoor and outdoor scenarios.|$|R
