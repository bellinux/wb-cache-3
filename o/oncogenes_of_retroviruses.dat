40|$|The first oncogenes {{discovered}} {{were the}} transforming genes of the oncogenic viruses (reviewed by Bishop 1985). The subsequent discovery that the <b>oncogenes</b> <b>of</b> <b>retroviruses</b> {{were derived from}} normal host cellular genes provided the first direct evidence that cellular genomes contain genes with transforming potential. More recently, the development of techniques for DNA transfer in eukaryotic cells led {{to the discovery of}} cellular transforming genes in tumor cells by their ability to induce foci of transformed NIH- 3 T 3 cells (reviewed by Land et al. 1983). Several new oncogenes have been discovered this way, including N-ras (Shimizu et al. 1983), met (Cooper et al. 1984), neu (Bargmann et al. 1986), and possible others (Goubin et al. 1983; Lane et al. 1984; Takahashi et al. 1985) ...|$|E

By screening with a human Alu-family probe, we isolated the human DNA sequence from the secondary transformant cells. This transforming sequence encompasses about 60 kilobase pairs and is unrelated to known human transforming genes.

40|$|The Myc {{proto-oncogene}} {{family members}} {{have been identified as}} the cellular homologs <b>of</b> the transforming <b>oncogene</b> <b>of</b> avian <b>retroviruses.</b> They encode central regulators of mammalian cell proliferation and apoptosis, and they associate with the bHLHZip protein Max to bind specific DNA sequences and regulate the expression of genes important for cell cycle progression. The other family members, Mad 1, Mxi 1, Mad 3, Mad 4 and Rox (Mnt) antagonize their activities. The Mads and Rox compete with Myc in heterodimerizing with Max and in binding to the same specific target sequences. These Mads:Max and Rox:Max dimers repress transcription through binding to the mSIN 3 corepressor protein and by tethering histone deacetylase-containing complexes to the DNA. In a screen for Rox interactors we isolated Mlx, a bHLHZip protein previously identified in a screen for Mad 1 interactors. In the present work we extend the known dimerization partners of Mlx by demonstrating its ability to interact with Rox. Moreover, we show that contrary to previous reports Mlx is able to homodimerize and to bind E-box sequences at low concentration levels. The possible role of Mlx in an emerging regulatory pathway and acting parallel to the Max driven network is discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for computing {{the rates of}} nucleotide substitution for an <b>oncogene</b> <b>of</b> a <b>retrovirus</b> (v-onc), its cellular homologue (c-onc), and the retrovirus genome simultaneously. The method {{has been applied to}} DNA sequences of the v-mos gene of Moloney murine sarcoma virus (Mo-MuSV) and the c-mos and gag genes of Mo-MuSV and Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV). The rates of nucleotide substitution for c-mos, the gag gene, and v-mos are estimated to be 1. 71 X 10 (- 9), 6. 3 X 10 (- 4), and 1. 31 X 10 (- 3) per site per year, respectively. The rate of evolution of c-mos is comparable to that of many functional genes in DNA genomes, suggesting some important biological function played by cellular <b>oncogenes.</b> The rates <b>of</b> nucleotide substitution in the v-mos and gag genes are very high and {{are similar to those of}} RNA viral genes such as the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes in the influenza A virus. Thus, oncogenes seem to exemplify a general feature of genome evolution: the rate of evolution of RNA genomes can be more than a million times greater than that of DNA genomes because of a high mutation rate in the RNA genome...|$|R
40|$|Oncogenes {{were first}} {{described}} as the genes of DNA tumor viruses responsible for in vivo and in vitro neoplastic transformation induced by such viruses. The first oncogenes described were the <b>oncogenes</b> <b>of</b> polyoma, SV 40 and papilloma viruses. The polyoma virus oncogene has been designated the 'middle' T (tumor) antigen, whereas the SV 40 oncogene is designated the 'large' T antigen. The large T of the polyoma virus {{can also be considered}} an oncogene, because it is capable of 'immortalizing', but not transforming primary cell cultures. Other <b>oncogenes</b> <b>of</b> DNA tumor viruses are the EIA of adenoviruses and the E 7 gene of papilloma viruses. It has been proposed that some <b>of</b> the <b>oncogenes</b> <b>of</b> DNA tumor viruses act by binding the products of tumor suppressor genes, such as the retinoblastoma gene product Rb. In general, the products <b>of</b> the <b>oncogenes</b> <b>of</b> DNA tumor viruses need the cooperation <b>of</b> other <b>oncogenes</b> to establish a completely transformed phenotype. Oncogenes have been discovered in all replication defective RNA tumor viruses, whereas they are not present in the genomes of replication competent RNA tumor viruses, which can also give rise to a neoplastic phenotype, in vivo, but by a different mechanism. The discovery <b>of</b> <b>oncogenes</b> in RNA tumor viruses has led to the concept that these oncogenes are actually present in the genomes of all eucaryotic organisms and have been transduced and, in some cases, modified by a <b>retrovirus.</b> The characterization <b>of</b> the <b>oncogenes</b> <b>of</b> acute transforming <b>retroviruses</b> has led to the present classification <b>of</b> <b>oncogenes,</b> which include genes coding for proteins having different functional properties, but all characterized by having some role in the pathway which regulates cell proliferation. The experimental approach of DNA transfection has led to the discoveries <b>of</b> some <b>oncogenes</b> already known from the genomes <b>of</b> <b>retroviruses</b> and also <b>of</b> some new <b>oncogenes</b> which had never been transduced by retroviruses.

40|$|The {{defective}} acute leukemia viruses avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) and E 26 virus each {{contain an}} inserted cellular sequence {{related to the}} same highly conserved cellular gene, proto-amv.

The product <b>of</b> the AMV <b>oncogene</b> (myb) is a 48, 000 Mr protein, p 48 myb, encoded by a transduced segment (amv) of proto-amv flanked by short helper-virus-derived terminal sequences. The E 26 virus oncogene product is a 135, 000 Mr protein, p 135 gag-amve-ets, encoded by significant portions of a viral structural gene (gag), sequences related to proto-amv (amve), and additional E 26 -specific sequences (ets) transduced from cellular proto-ets. Both p 48 myb and p 135 gag-amve-ets transforming proteins {{are located in the}} nucleus of cells transformed by these viruses.

40|$|Lens epithelium-derived {{growth factor}} (LEDGF) fusion {{proteins}} can direct HIV- 1 DNA integration to novel {{sites in the}} host genome. The C terminus of LEDGF contains an integrase binding domain (IBD), and the N terminus binds chromatin. LEDGF normally directs integrations to the bodies of expressed genes. Replacing the N terminus of LEDGF with chromatin binding domains (CBDs) from other proteins changes the specificity of HIV- 1 DNA integration. We chose two well-characterized CBDs: the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger from ING 2 and the chromodomain from heterochromatin binding protein 1 alpha (HP 1 alpha). The ING 2 PHD finger binds H 3 K 4 me 3, a histone mark {{that is associated with}} the transcriptional start sites of expressed genes. The HP 1 alpha chromodomain binds H 3 K 9 me 2, 3, histone marks that are widely distributed throughout the genome. A fusion protein in which the ING 2 PHD finger was linked to the LEDGF IBD directed integrations near the start sites of expressed genes. A similar fusion protein in which the HP 1 alpha chromodomain was linked to the LEDGF IBD directed integrations to sites that differed from both the PHD finger fusion-directed and LEDGF-directed integration sites. The ability to redirect HIV- 1 DNA integration may help solve the problems associated with the activation <b>of</b> <b>oncogenes</b> when <b>retroviruses</b> are used in gene therapy...|$|R
40|$|Mill-Hill- 2 virus (MH 2) proviral DNA was cloned from a {{transformed}} non-producer {{cell culture}} (MH 2 QB 2) through insertion of randomly cut high mol. wt. cellular DNA in the lambdoid vector L 47. 1. Restriction {{analysis of a}} suitable recombinant phage by Southern DNA blotting and hybridization with different probes allowed us to characterize the genetic organization of the provirus and to identify a novel MH 2 -specific sequence of at least 1. 1 kbp. Such a sequence, for which we propose the name v-mil, from MilI-Hill- 2 virus, is not homologous to v-myc, the previously described <b>oncogene</b> <b>of</b> MH 2, nor to avian leukaemia virus-related sequences. Evidence is presented here that v-mil has a cellular counterpart (c-mil) phylogenetically conserved in birds and mammals, including man, and expressed as a single RNA species {{at least in some}} tissues.

40|$|The c-ets- 1 locus encodes two {{transcription}} factors, p 54 c-ets- 1 and p 68 c-ets- 1 that recognize purine-rich motifs. The v-ets <b>oncogene</b> <b>of</b> the avian <b>retrovirus</b> E 26 {{differs from}} its cellular progenitor p 68 c-ets- 1 by two amino acid substitutions (alanine 285 and isoleucine 445 in c-ets- 1 both substituted by valine in v-ets, mutations A and B respectively) and its carboxy-terminal end (mutation C). The B mutation affects a well conserved residue in the carboxy-terminal 85 amino acids, ETS DNA-binding domain. To address the biological {{relevance of the}} B mutation found between v-ets and c-ets- 1, we have randomly mutagenized isoleucine 445 of p 68 c-ets- 1 by polymerase chain reaction. Using in vitro gel mobility shift assays, we show that this residue is crucial for the binding properties of c-ets- 1 since the 12 mutations we have generated at this position, all diminish or even abolish the binding, to the 'optimized' Ets- 1 binding site (EBS), of 35 kDa proteins corresponding to the 311 carboxy-terminal residues of c-ets- 1. Among them, substitutions of isoleucine to glutamic acid, glycine or proline have the highest inhibitory effects. Similar results were obtained when the same mutations were introduced either in full-length p 68 c-ets- 1 protein or into a carboxy-terminal polypeptide of 109 amino acids encompassing the ETS-domain which has previously been shown to display a very high binding activity {{as compared with the}} full-length protein. Consistent with the in vitro results, point mutations in p 68 c-ets- 1 that decrease binding activity to EBS abrogate its ability to transactivate reporter plasmids carrying either the TPA <b>Oncogene</b> Response Unit <b>of</b> the Polyoma virus enhancer (TORU) or a sequence derived from the HTLV- 1 LTR. Furthermore, as this isoleucine residue is rather well-conserved within the ETS gene family, we show that mutation of the corresponding isoleucine of c-ets- 2 into glycine also abrogates its DNA-binding and hence, transactivating properties. Thus, the v-ets B mutation highlights the isoleucine 445 as an essential amino acid of the c-ets- 1 and c-ets- 2 DNA-binding domains...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Retroviruses infect a {{wide range}} of vertebrates. However, {{little is known about the}} {{diversity}} <b>of</b> <b>retroviruses</b> in basal vertebrates. Endogenous retrovirus (ERV) provides a valuable resource to study the ecology and evolution <b>of</b> <b>retrovirus.</b> FINDINGS: I performed a genome-scale screening for ERVs in the elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii) and identified three complete or nearly complete ERVs and many short ERV fragments. I designate these retroviral elements "C. milli ERVs" (CmiERVs). Phylogenetic analysis shows that the CmiERVs form three distinct lineages. The genome invasions by these retroviruses are estimated to take place more than 50 million years ago. CONCLUSIONS: My results reveal the extensive retroviral diversity in the elephant shark. Diverse retroviruses appear to have been associated with cartilaginous fishes for millions of years.

40|$|For many {{gene therapy}} {{applications}} the effective titre of retroviral vectors is a limiting factor both in vitro and in vivo.

The study reported here uses heat-killed, formaldehyde fixed Staphylococcus aureus (Pansorbin) absorbed to PG 13 derived retrovirus.

This procedure increases the effective titre <b>of</b> <b>retrovirus</b> by up to 7500 -fold after an only 200 -fold reduction in volume. The affinity <b>of</b> Pansorbin for <b>retrovirus</b> allows concentration regardless of its encoded genes and makes this protocol applicable to other popular packaging cells and envelope proteins.
