5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court.

Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the Supreme Court had in the past.|$|E
5|$|Detestation of {{existing}} policies is easily transformed into forcible resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> which {{puts them in}} execution, {{and it would be}} folly to disregard the causal relation between the two.

The distinction is not scholastic subterfuge, but a hard-bought acquisition in the fight for freedom.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to constitutional powers, governors {{also have a}} considerable degree of statutory authority. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> exercised by governors {{on a daily basis}} is derived from statute, giving the General Assembly a great degree of power to expand or contract the governor's authority. Historically, the party in control of the General Assembly would reassign control of agencies from the governor or to the governor based his party affiliation, and the party affiliation of the cabinet heads, which at times has left the governor with no direct control over state agencies.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{built by}} Bishop Gundulf {{in the late}} 12thcentury was {{enclosed}} by a stone wall. Situated in the south-west corner of the city, the castle used {{the remains of the}} Roman town walls as foundations. The circuit had at least one tower; it was replaced in the 14thcentury. The original gateway was radically altered in the 13th or 14thcentury. From across the River Medway, the twin landmarks of Rochester's castle and cathedral would have dominated the medieval landscape, symbolic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> of the church and nobility in the period. Most castles were built by secular nobles, but the work by Gundulf and his successor Corbeil provide examples {{of the role of the}} church in castle building.|$|E

5|$|However the ECSC {{failed to}} achieve several {{fundamental}} aims of the Treaty of Paris. It was hoped the ECSC would prevent a resurgence of large coal and steel {{groups such as the}} Konzerne, which helped Adolf Hitler rise to power. In the Cold War trade-offs, the cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent price fixing (another element that was meant to be tackled). With a democratic supervisory system the worst aspects of past abuse were avoided with the anti-cartel powers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Authority,</b> the first international anti-cartel agency in the world. Efficient firms were allowed to expand into a European market without undue domination. Oil, gas, electricity became natural competitors to coal and also broke cartel powers. Furthermore, with the move to oil, the Community failed to define a proper energy policy. The Euratom treaty was largely stifled by de Gaulle and the European governments refused the suggestion of an Energy Community involving electricity and other vectors that was suggested at Messina in 1955. In a time of high inflation and monetary instability ECSC also fell short of ensuring an upward equalisation of pay of workers within the market. These failures could be put down to overambition {{in a short period of}} time, or that the goals were merely political posturing to be ignored. It has been argued that the greatest achievements of the European Coal and Steel Community lie in its revolutionary democratic concepts of a supranational Community.|$|E
5|$|In Asia Minor, Conrad {{decided not}} {{to wait for the}} French, and marched towards Iconium, capital of the Seljuq Sultanate of Rûm. Conrad split his army into two divisions. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> of the Byzantine Empire in the western provinces of Asia Minor was more nominal than real, with much of the provinces being a no-man's land {{controlled}} by Turkish nomads. Conrad underestimated the length of the march against Anatolia, and anyhow assumed that the authority of Emperor Manuel was greater in Anatolia than was in fact the case. Conrad took the knights and the best troops with himself to march overland while sending the camp followers with Otto of Freising to follow the coastal road. The king led one of these, which was almost totally destroyed by the Seljuqs on 25 October 1147 at the second battle of Dorylaeum.|$|E
5|$|Although {{subject to}} all {{national}} laws and government, the Antakarana are also {{united in their}} recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> of a king (Ampanjaka) who is the living descendent {{of a line of}} Antankarana royalty going back nearly four centuries. The authority of this king is reaffirmed every five years at the village of Ambatoharaña in a ritual mast-raising ceremony called the tsangantsainy. Although some accounts date the ritual back to the origins of Antankarana kingship, the specific features of the ceremony as practiced today are rooted in historical events of the 19th century. The ceremony includes a pilgrimage to Nosy Mitsio to commemorate the flight of Antankarana refugees to the island in the 1830s to escape the advancing armies of the Kingdom of Imerina and to visit the tombs of ancestors who died there; until recently, it has sometimes also included raising both French and Antankarana banners to honor the 1841 treaty signed with the French. The king is selected by a council of elder {{members of the royal family}} in the ruling line. He is responsible for reciting joro (ancestral invocations) at ceremonies where the ancestors' blessings are requested. Another important social role is that of the Ndriambavibe. The Antankarana community selects a single noble woman to hold this position, which has similar authority and importance to that of the king. She is not his wife; rather, she has a separate leadership role to fulfill. The Antankarana are recognized among Malagasy as one of the few remaining ethnic groups in Madagascar that continues to reassert the ancestral authority of their king through continued practice of traditional kingship rituals.|$|E
