Provincials, on the other hand, were usually non-citizens, although some Magistrates and their families and relatives held the Latin Right.|$|E

In the third part a close reading <b>of</b> <b>Romans</b> 8 : 18 – 30 is given, followed by concluding remarks.

5|$|Crassus' {{defeat at}} Carrhae {{was one of}} the worst {{military}} defeats <b>of</b> <b>Roman</b> history. Parthia's victory cemented its reputation as a formidable if not equal power with Rome.

However, fearing his ambitions even for the Arsacid throne, Orodes had Surena executed shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Direct trade {{links between}} the Mediterranean lands and India had been {{established}} in the late 2nd century BC by the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. Greek navigators learned to use the regular pattern of the monsoon winds for their trade voyages in the Indian Ocean. The lively sea trade in Roman times is confirmed by the excavation of large deposits <b>of</b> <b>Roman</b> coins along much of the coast of India. Many trading ports with links to Roman communities {{have been identified in}} India and Sri Lanka along the route used by the Roman mission. Archaeological evidence stretching from the Red Sea ports <b>of</b> <b>Roman</b> Egypt to India suggests that Roman commercial activity in the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia declined heavily with the Antonine Plague of 166 AD, the same year as the first Roman embassy to Han China, where similar plague outbreaks had occurred from 151 AD.|$|E
