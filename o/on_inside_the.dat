5|$|Although {{potentially}} dangerous objects and money were confiscated and stored when a prisoner first entered the Bastille, most wealthy prisoners continued {{to bring in}} additional luxuries, including pet dogs or cats to control the local vermin. The Marquis de Sade, for example, arrived with an elaborate wardrobe, paintings, tapestries, a selection of perfume, {{and a collection of}} 133 books. Card games and billiards were played among the prisoners, and alcohol and tobacco were permitted. Servants could sometimes accompany their masters into the Bastille, as in the cases of the 1746 detention of the family of Lord Morton and their entire household as British spies: the family's domestic life continued <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> prison relatively normally. The prisoners' library had grown during the 18th century, mainly through ad hoc purchases and various confiscations by the Crown, until by 1787 it included 389 volumes.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew what was going <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens in}} Paris, {{a day before}} the {{original}} game's start, with journalist Nicole Collard receiving a request {{to go to the}} Palais Royale, to interview a famous media tycoon and potential candidate for President of France, Pierre Carchon. A mime hangs around outside Carchon's home, but Nico ignores him and goes <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> house. She meets Carchon's wife, Imelda, as well as Carchon, who reveals that he knew Nico's father, Thierry Collard, very well. Soon, there is a noise in the drawing room; Carchon investigates only to be shot. Nico rushes to the scene to see the mime over Pierre's corpse. She is knocked to the ground before she can do anything and wakes up to find Imelda going to call the police.|$|E

25|$|On 20 July 656, {{finding the}} gate of Uthman's house {{strongly}} guarded by his supporters, the Egyptian rebels climbed the back wall and crept inside, leaving the guards on the gate unaware {{of what was going}} <b>on</b> <b>inside.</b> <b>The</b> rebels entered his room and struck blows at his head. Naila, the wife of Uthman, threw herself on his body to protect him and raised her hand to deflect a sword. She had her fingers chopped off and was pushed aside. The next blow killed Uthman. Some of Uthman's slaves counter-attacked, one of whom killed the assassin and was in turn killed by the rebels.|$|E
25|$|By late March, the Burmese had dug tunnels to the walls, and mined them. At 4 pm on 7 April, several {{sections}} of the wall were brought down by the mines underneath, and the Burmese troops supported by artillery fire stormed the walls. (Harvey reports the date as 28 March but the Konbaung Hset Chronicle gives Tuesday, 5th waxing of Tabaung 1125 ME, which is 7 April.) The attackers finally breached the walls by sunset, and entered the city. The Siamese fought <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> city but were eventually overwhelmed. Indiscriminate slaughter followed. Everything in sight was put to the torch. Even images of the Buddha were hacked for the gold {{with which they were}} coated.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{red brick}} and {{terracotta}} was pioneered during this period. Red terracotta was {{useful as a}} substitute for natural stone, which Birmingham lacked, and it also was resistant to soot and smoke which was prevalent in the city due to the heavy industrial presence. Birmingham's importance as a growing town encouraged the construction of municipal buildings which were designed by some of the most prominent architects of the time. Sir Aston Webb and Ingress Bell's Victoria Law Courts were completed in 1891 and feature extensive use of terracotta on the exterior. The ornamentation on the exterior, which includes a statue of Queen Victoria, is carried <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> building. Webb was not the only major architect to make an impact on Birmingham.|$|E

In a 2005 interview, Spielberg stated that he made Close Encounters when he did not have children, and if he were making it today, he would never have had Neary leave his family and go on the mother ship.|$|E
500|$|Brad Wheeler, {{writing for}} The Globe and Mail, {{wondered}} if the eponymous title was an allusion to the Atlantic Records contractual dispute. He went on to remark on the music's combination of 90s era [...] "guitar flash and crunch" [...] and The Beatles. Wheeler did not think the album moved the band or its sound forward, calling it [...] "a quasi-comeback album that neither defiles nor builds upon the band's legend." [...] Amirose Eisenbach of IGN wrote that the music was not [...] "anything especially unique". Eisenbach analyzed several tracks, observing that some songs [...] "start off promising" [...] only to result in [...] "uninspired, generic hooks," [...] while other songs struggle with their musical direction. Despite this, Eisenbach felt the album had [...] "enough going <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> album's 41 minutes that it's worth a listen." ...|$|E
