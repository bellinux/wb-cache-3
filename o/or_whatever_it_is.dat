500|$|Richard Feynman {{likewise}} held {{a favorable}} {{view of the}} house and of his tenure as Telluride House Faculty Fellow. In an interview he described the House as [...] "a group of boys that have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains". He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that [...] "it’s there that I did the fundamental work" [...] for which he won the Nobel Prize. In a correspondence with a fellow Telluride associate congratulating him on the Nobel Prize, Feynman said, [...] "It was at Telluride that I did do all that stuff for which I got the prize, so I look back at those days with nostalgia." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Be Tamed" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Antonina Armato and Tim James, {{who also}} {{produced}} the track. According to Cyrus, the track's moral is to free yourself from any biding or hindrance, in particular application to women. Cyrus said the song's message applies to different situations. Personally to her, [...] "it is {{about being a}} cage and people looking at you." [...] As for others, she believed it could describe high school, {{in a situation where}} [...] "someone feeling they have to be one way to be with a clique {{and they want to be}} who they are. A relationship, <b>or</b> <b>whatever,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> just breaking out and feeling free." [...] Hollywood Records described [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] as [...] "a self-empowering song in which Miley asserts that she has to stay true to herself in relationships".|$|E
500|$|Composer Gus Levene {{commented that}} Sinatra's {{strength}} {{was that when}} it came to lyrics, telling a story musically, Sinatra displayed a [...] "genius" [...] ability and feeling, which with the [...] "rare combination of voice and showmanship" [...] made him the [...] "original singer" [...] which others who followed most tried to emulate. George Roberts, a trombonist in Sinatra's band, remarked that Sinatra had a [...] "charisma, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> about him, that no one else had". Biographer Arnold Shaw considered that [...] "If Las Vegas had not existed, Sinatra could have invented it". He quoted reporter James Bacon in saying that Sinatra was the [...] "swinging image on which the town is built", adding that no other entertainer quite [...] "embodied the glamour" [...] associated with Las Vegas as him. Sinatra continues to be seen as one of the icons of the 20th century, ...|$|E

6000|$|The boy, with {{a return}} of that former {{reluctance}} <b>or</b> struggle <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> seemed to debate with himself. At length he said, raising {{his eyes to the}} master's face: ...|$|R
500|$|By 1949, Feynman was {{becoming}} restless at Cornell. He never {{settled into a}} particular house or apartment, living in guest houses or student residences, or with married friends [...] "until these arrangements became sexually volatile". He liked to date undergraduates, hire prostitutes, and sleep with the wives of friends. He was not fond of Ithaca's cold winter weather, and pined for a warmer climate. Above all, at Cornell, he {{was always in the}} shadow of Hans Bethe. Feynman did, however, look back favorably on the Telluride House, where he resided for a large period of his Cornell career. In an interview, he described the House as [...] "a group of boys [...] have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains". He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that [...] "it's there that I did the fundamental work" [...] for which he won the Nobel Prize.|$|E
500|$|Owing to its {{popularity}} and media exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster {{is often used}} as a modern version of Russell's teapot. Proponents argue that, since {{the existence of the}} invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster—similar to other proposed supernatural beings—cannot be falsified, it demonstrates that the burden of proof rests on those who affirm the existence of such beings. Richard Dawkins explains, [...] "The onus is on somebody who says, I want to believe in God, Flying Spaghetti Monster, fairies, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> It is not up to us to disprove it." [...] Furthermore, according to Lance Gharavi, an editor of The Journal of Religion and Theater, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is [...] "ultimately...an argument about the arbitrariness of holding any one view of creation", since any one view is equally as plausible as the Flying Spaghetti Monster. A similar argument was discussed in the books The God Delusion and The Atheist Delusion.|$|E
500|$|Keenan and Jones {{met through}} {{a mutual friend}} in 1989. After Keenan played a tape {{recording}} for Jones of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming their own band. They started jamming together and were {{on the lookout for}} a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by Tom Morello, an old high school friend of Jones and former member of Electric Sheep. Carey began playing in their sessions because he [...] "felt kinda sorry for them," [...] as other invited musicians were not showing up. Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced them to bassist D'Amour. Early on, the band fabricated the story that they formed because of the pseudophilosophy [...] "lachrymology". Although [...] "lachrymology" [...] was also cited as an inspiration for the band's name, Keenan later explained their intentions differently: [...] "Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It's a big dick. It's a wrench. ... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out whatever it is you need to find out, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> you're trying to achieve." ...|$|E

At first Dick imagined the beast, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> was going to retreat to the timber, but soon it appeared to turn back, {{as if to make}} another semicircle, this time around {{to the rear of the}} house.|$|R
6000|$|Britt went on musingly. [...] "One {{night as}} I sat between Viola and the closed piano, the spook, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> {{ran up and}} down the keys--now on the treble, now on the bass--keeping time to my whistling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} the vision <b>or</b> reflection, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> startled {{me so much}} that I {{came to a halt}} under the lee of one of the monoliths, and found myself unable even to call to the distraught man whom I pursued.|$|R
2500|$|Looking {{for a more}} hard-hitting sound {{than that}} of their {{previous}} album, U2 began recording How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb in February 2003 with Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, {{but they were not}} satisfied with the results. The group subsequently enlisted Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. U2 lead singer Bono described the album as [...] "our first rock album. It's taken us twenty years <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> but this is our first rock album." [...] Thematically, the record touches on life, death, love, war, faith, and family.|$|E

I hope you didn't {{find what you}} wanted not to find, or get off at the station where there wasn't any, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> you {{expected}} wouldn't happen to you during the three years you've been away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{very much}} fear," [...] {{he said to}} Captain Millet, after {{inspecting}} his patient, [...] "that the poor fellow has received some bad internal injuries. The mast, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> must have struck him a tremendous blow, for his side is severely bruised, {{and two of his}} ribs are broken." ...|$|R

6000|$|First comes Easter, pagan {{goddess of}} spring. Here his fancy may have free play. A {{beautiful}} maiden with decorative {{hair and the}} proper number of toes will fill the bill.

"The {{chief officer}} ordered {{a good many}} of the sails to be taken in, for they were only uselessly {{straining}} the masts, but there were enough left to move her in case the power of the current, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that stopped her, had slackened, and she steadily kept her position with the breeze abaft.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} the {{invisible}} dog, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> could not get in unless the door was open. I had frequently noticed that when he entered a room <b>it</b> <b>was</b> through an open door, and I sometimes knew of his approach by seeing an unlatched door open without visible cause; so, feeling secure for the present, I lay and gasped and panted.|$|R

60|$|George {{looked at}} her, startled. He had hardly {{been aware of}} her {{presence}} till now. Rapidly he diagnosed her as a mother--or aunt. She looked more like an aunt. Of course, it must seem odd to her, his charging in like this, a perfect stranger, and beginning to chat with her daughter, <b>or</b> niece, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> He began to justify himself.|$|R
60|$|This {{attitude}} so far {{won their}} confidence that before we parted at our last meeting, after most solemn vows {{of faith and}} secrecy, they took me into the secret. This was, however, {{only to the extent}} of teaching me the code and method; they still withheld from me rigidly the fact or political secret, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that was the mainspring of their united action.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> a {{long night}} for both of the boys. They took turns at resting and at {{replenishing}} the fire, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> doubtful if either of them got much real sleep.

But the animal, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> soon went away, {{and that was the}} end of the disturbance.|$|R

6000|$|... "Indeed I couldn't," [...] she whispered, {{letting her}} hand lie passive in his tight grasp. [...] "I only wish I {{could give you}} {{something}} more, or better, <b>or</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> you want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} my entire confidence, Spencer," [...] Duncombe declared. [...] "The man {{who called himself}} Fielding was badly wounded, and he passed here almost unconscious.

6000|$|... "Yes, a {{very curious}} coincidence," [...] he continued, {{with the same}} knowing look. [...] "Of course, you are aware that your cousin Everard King was the next heir to the estates.
