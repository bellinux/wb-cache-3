5|$|Nearly 80 {{species of}} fish and {{shellfish}} are commercially harvested from seamounts, including spiny lobster (Palinuridae), mackerel (Scombridae and others), red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus), red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), tuna (Scombridae), <b>Orange</b> <b>roughy</b> (Hoplostethus atlanticus), and perch (Percidae).|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} abundance, seamounts {{are one of}} the most common marine {{ecosystems}} in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, as well as their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike. Their aggregational effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are ongoing concerns on the negative impact of fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is {{a serious}} threat to {{seamount}} ecological welfare. There are several well-documented cases of fishery exploitation, for example the <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> (Hoplostethus atlanticus) off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand and the pelagic armorhead (Pseudopentaceros richardsoni) near Japan and Russia. The {{reason for this is that}} the fishes that are targeted over seamounts are typically long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-maturing. The problem is confounded by the dangers of trawling, which damages seamount surface communities, and the fact that many seamounts are located in international waters, making proper monitoring difficult. Bottom trawling in particular is extremely devastating to seamount ecology, and is responsible for as much as 95% of ecological damage to seamounts.|$|E

5|$|An active {{predator}} of mobile, {{relatively large}} organisms, the Portuguese dogfish feeds mainly on cephalopods (including Mastigoteuthis spp.) and bony fishes (including slickheads, <b>orange</b> <b>roughy,</b> lantern fishes, and rattails). It {{has also been}} known to take other sharks and invertebrates (such as the medusa Atolla wyvillei), as well as scavenging from whale carcasses. The Portuguese dogfish has more acute vision than many other deepsea sharks: {{in addition to having}} a large pupil and lens, and a tapetum lucidum, its eyes also contain a high concentration of ganglion cells mostly concentrated in a horizontal streak that is densest at the center; these cells impart highly sensitive motion detection along the horizontal plane. The visual system of this species appears adapted for detecting bioluminescence: the maximum absorption of its visual pigments correspond to the wavelengths of light emitted by favored prey, such as the squids Heteroteuthis dispar, Histioteuthis spp., Lycoteuthis lorigera, and Taningia danae.|$|E

25|$|Many {{deep sea}} fish are at risk, such as <b>orange</b> <b>roughy,</b> Patagonian toothfish, and sablefish. The deep sea is almost {{completely}} dark, near freezing and has little food. Deep sea fish grow slowly because of limited food, have slow metabolisms, low reproductive rates, and many don't reach breeding maturity for 30 to 40 years. A fillet of <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> {{at the store}} is probably at least 50 years old. Most deep sea fish are in international waters, {{where there are no}} legal protections. Most of these fish are caught by deep trawlers near seamounts, where they congregate because of food. Flash freezing allows the trawlers to work for days at a time, and modern fishfinders target the fish with ease.|$|E
25|$|Seafood Watch {{have placed}} {{on their list}} of seafood that sustainability-minded {{consumers}} should avoid the following demersal fish: sturgeon (imported wild), Chilean seabass, cod (Atlantic, imported Pacific), flounder (Atlantic), halibut (Atlantic), sole (Atlantic), grouper, monkfish, <b>orange</b> <b>roughy,</b> demersal shark, red snapper and tilapia (Asia farmed).|$|E

Examples are the <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> and Patagonian toothfish. Because these fish were once abundant, and because their robust bodies are good to eat, these fish have been commercially harvested.|$|E

25|$|During {{colonial times}} the cuisines of the British Isles were the {{standard}} {{in most areas}} of Tasmania. Tasmania now has {{a wide range of}} restaurants, in part due to the arrival of immigrants and changing cultural patterns. Scattered across Tasmania are many vineyards, and Tasmanian beer brands such as Boags and Cascade are known and sold in Mainland Australia. King Island off the northwestern coast of Tasmania has a reputation for boutique cheeses and dairy products. Tasmanians are also consumers of seafood, such as crayfish, <b>orange</b> <b>roughy,</b> salmon and oysters, both farmed and wild.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{scientists}} {{have called for}} an end to subsidies paid to deep sea fisheries. In international waters beyond the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zones of coastal countries, many fisheries are unregulated, and fishing fleets plunder the depths with state-of-the-art technology. In a few hours, massive nets weighing up to 15 tons, [...] dragged along the bottom by deep-water trawlers, can destroy deep-sea corals and sponge beds that have taken centuries or millennia to grow. The trawlers can target <b>orange</b> <b>roughy,</b> grenadiers, or sharks. These fish are usually long-lived and late maturing, and their populations take decades, even centuries to recover.|$|E

2500|$|Sustainable seafood is a {{movement}} that has gained momentum as more people become aware of overfishing and environmentally destructive fishing methods. Sustainable seafood is seafood from either fished or farmed sources that can maintain or increase production in the future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired. In general, slow-growing fish that reproduce late in life, such as <b>orange</b> <b>roughy,</b> are vulnerable to overfishing. [...] Seafood species that grow quickly and breed young, such as anchovies and sardines, are much more resistant to overfishing. Several organizations, including the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), and Friend of the Sea, certify seafood fisheries as sustainable.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> stocks live outside the {{jurisdiction}} of any particular nation, making it more challenging to limit overall catches. The South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation [...] (SPRFMO) and the South Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement [...] have <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> stocks which are managed within their jurisdiction. These organizations have made progress on collecting better information on total <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> catches and also setting catch limits for fisheries on the high seas. For example, SPRFMO limited <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> catches and effort from 2007.|$|E
50|$|New Zealand {{currently}} {{operates the}} largest <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> fisheries in the world, {{with a total}} catch of over 8,500 tonnes in the 2014 calendar year. This accounts for 95% of the total estimated global catch of <b>orange</b> <b>roughy.</b> Exports of <b>orange</b> <b>roughy</b> provided an estimated revenue to New Zealand of NZ$53 million (US$ 37M) in 2015.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} errors in {{estimating}} the population dynamics {{of a species}} occurred within the New Zealand <b>Orange</b> <b>roughy</b> fishery.
