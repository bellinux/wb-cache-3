40|$|Blast mats {{that can}} be {{retrofitted}} {{to the floor of}} military vehicles are considered {{to reduce the risk of}} injury from under‐vehicle explosions. Anthropometric test devices (ATDs) are validated for use <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the <b>seated</b> <b>position.</b> The aim of this study was to use a traumatic injury simulator fitted with 3 different blast mats in order to assess the ability of 2 ATD designs to evaluate the protective capacity of the mats in 2 occupant postures under 2 severities. Tests were performed for each combination of mat design, ATD, severity and posture using an antivehicle under‐belly injury simulator. The differences between mitigation systems were larger under the H‐III compared to the MiL‐Lx. There was little difference in how the 2 ATDs and how posture ranked the mitigation systems. Results from this study suggest that conclusions obtained by testing <b>in</b> the <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> can be extrapolated to the standing. However, the different percentage reductions observed in the 2 ATDs suggests different levels of protection. It is therefore unclear which ATD should be used to assess such mitigation systems. A correlation between cadavers and ATDs on the protection offered by blast mats is required in order to elucidate this issue...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{preliminary}} study was to describe a simple protocol {{for the analysis of}} the heart rate variability (HRV) that can reveal the different autonomic control between noncomplicated diabetic patients and normal subjects within 15 min.

40|$|PURPOSE: Hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) is {{commonly}} assessed using the CO re-breathing method {{with the subject}} <b>in</b> the <b>seated</b> <b>position.</b> This may lead to an underestimation of Hbmass as blood in lower extremity veins while seated may not be tagged with carbon monoxide (CO) during the re-breathing period. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, CO re-breathing was performed on four occasions in nine male subjects, twice <b>in</b> the <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> and twice <b>in</b> combination with light cycle ergometer exercise (1 W/kg body-weight) intending to accelerate blood circulation and thereby potentially allowing for a better distribution of CO throughout the circulation as compared to <b>in</b> the <b>seated</b> <b>position.</b> Blood samples were drawn from an antecubital vein and the saphenous magna vein following the re-breathing procedure. RESULTS: <b>In</b> the <b>seated</b> <b>position,</b> CO re-breathing increased the percent carboxyhemoglobin (%HbCO) in the antecubital vein to 8. 9 % (7. 8 - 10. 7) [median (min-max) ], but less (P = 0. 017) in the saphenous magna vein [7. 8 % (5. 0 - 9. 9) ]. With exercise, no differences in %HbCO were observed between sampling sites. As a result, CO re-breathing in combination with exercise revealed a ~ 3 % higher (P = 0. 008) Hbmass, i. e., 936 g (757 - 1, 018) as compared to 908 g (718 - 940) at seated rest. CONCLUSION: This study suggests an uneven distribution of CO in the circulation if the CO re-breathing procedure is performed at rest <b>in</b> the <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> and therefore can underestimate Hbmass...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} recovery protocols on heart rate recovery (HRR) trend through fitted heart rate (HR) decay curves were assessed. Twenty one trained male athletes and 19 sedentary male students performed a submaximal cycle exercise test on four occasions followed by 5 min: 1) inactive recovery <b>in</b> the upright <b>seated</b> <b>position,</b> 2) active (cycling) recovery <b>in</b> the upright <b>seated</b> <b>position,</b> 3) supine position, and 4) supine position with elevated legs. The HRR was assessed as {{the difference between}} the peak exercise HR and the HR recorded following 60 seconds of recovery (HRR 60). Additionally the time constant decay was obtained by fitting the 5 minute post-exercise HRR into a first-order exponential curve. Within- subject differences of HRR 60 for all recovery protocols in both groups were significant (p 0. 05). Values of HRR 60 were larger in the group of athletes for all conditions (p 0. 05). Between group difference was found for active recovery <b>in</b> the <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> and the supine position with elevated legs (p < 0. 05). We conclude that the supine position with or without elevated legs accelerated HRR compared with the two <b>seated</b> <b>positions.</b> Active recovery <b>in</b> the <b>seated</b> upright <b>position</b> was associated with slower HRR compared with inactive recovery in the same position. The HRR in athletes was accelerated in the supine position with elevated legs and with active recovery <b>in</b> the <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> compared with non-athlete...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Internal Jugular Veins (IJVs) are the {{principle}} outflow pathway for intracranial blood in clinostatism condition. <b>In</b> the <b>seated</b> <b>position,</b> IJVs collapse, while Vertebral Veins (VVs) increase the venous outflow and partially compensate the venous drainage. Spinal Epidural Veins are an additional drainage pathway <b>in</b> the <b>seated</b> <b>position.</b> Colour- Doppler-Sonography (CDS) examination {{is able to}} demonstrate IJVs and VVs outflow in different postural and respiratory conditions. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate CDS quantification of the cerebral venous outflow (CVF) in healthy subjects and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a group of 27 healthy adults (13 females and 14 males; mean age 37. 8 ± 11. 2 years), and 52 patients with MS (32 females and 20 males; mean age 42. 6 ± 12. 1 years), CVF has been measured in clinostatism and <b>in</b> the <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> as the sum of the flow in IJVs and VVs. The difference between CVF in clinostatism and CVF <b>in</b> the <b>seated</b> <b>position</b> (ΔCVF) has been correlated with patients' status (healthy or MS), and a number of clinical variables in MS patients. Statistical analysis was performed by Fisher's exact test, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test, ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test, and correntropy coefficient. The value of ΔCVF was negative in 59. 6 % of patients with MS and positive in 96. 3 % of healthy subjects. Negative ΔCVF values were significantly associated with MS (p< 0. 0001). There was no significant correlation with clinical variables. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Negative ΔCVF has a hemodynamic significance, since it reflects an increased venous return <b>in</b> the <b>seated</b> <b>position.</b> This seems to be a pathologic condition. In MS patients, a vascular dysregulation resulting from involvement of the autonomous nervous system may be supposed. ΔCVF value should be included in the quantitative CDS evaluation of the cerebral venous drainage, in order to identify cerebral venous return abnormalities...|$|R

MÉTODOS: sessenta e quatro pacientes com queixa de incontinência urinária de esforço (IUE) com idades variando entre 25 e 80 anos, atendidas no ambulatório de uroginecologia e cirurgia vaginal, no período de junho 2003 a setembro 2005 foram incluídas neste estudo. As pacientes foram inicialmente submetidas ao estudo urodinâmico de acordo com a técnica preconizada pela International Continency Society (ICS) na posição ortostática e logo depois foram avaliadas na posição sentada. RESULTADOS: diferença significante foi obtida após a avaliação das pressões de perda obtidas nas diferentes posições (99, 8 ± 33, 3 versus 102, 9 ± 32, 4; respectivamente, posição sentada e em pé, p PURPOSE: {{compare the}} outcomes verified during urodynamic investigation realized {{in two different}} positions related to urinary leak point pressure under stress and to discuss its clinical relevance. METHODS: sixty-four patients with stress urinary incontinency (SUI) aged 25 - 80 years old, attended, during June 2003 to September 2005 were included in this study. Patients were initially submitted to urodynamic investigation in accordance with International Continence Society (ICS) techniques in orthostatic position and just after were evaluated <b>in</b> <b>seating</b> <b>position.</b> RESULTS: statistical significance was obtained after evaluation of Vasalva leak point pressure (VLPP) obtained in two positions (99, 8 ± 33, 3 versus 102, 9 ± 32, 4; respectivamente, posição sentada e em pé, p< 0, 05). Linear regression test based on frequency analyses was applied with the purpose to verify the patient percentage allocated in confidence interval in terms of Valsalva leak point pressure <b>in</b> <b>seating</b> or orthostatic <b>positions.</b> A rate of 90. 6 % of compatibility was gotten in these results.
