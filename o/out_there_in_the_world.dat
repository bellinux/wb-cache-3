500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world...</b> it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E

50|$|According to integrationist principles, the {{separation}} of linguistic phenomena into distinct parts of study is a fundamental error in the conceptualization of language. In 'The Language Myth', Harris postulates that the isolation and subsequent segregational approach of orthodox linguistics {{is a result of}} the fact of language itself being the descriptive medium for its own study. A problem arises when we consider words as stand-ins for things. When we then have a word for a language, the word misleads us to consider languages to be things <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> rather than real time, second order processes undergoing constant adjustment.|$|E
