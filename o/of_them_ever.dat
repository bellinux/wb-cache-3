On April 2, 2013 Hit-Boy, claimed besides Cudi, {{he was the only}} other person to provide production on the album. Cudi later confirmed the statement via Twitter.

5|$|Chuck and Sarah turn to Jack to {{help them}} {{continue}} Daphne's con and capture the Zephyr. They manage to lead the Klügs away from the reception and incapacitate them, {{only to find that}} none of them has the Zephyr. Jack realizes that the Klügs have been performing a shell game: the government has been pursuing them for the Zephyr when none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> had it; their father (Timothy V. Murphy) had it all along. Meanwhile, the bride's father realizes he is being conned and leads Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) away at gunpoint. When Chuck and Sarah confront him, Klüg uses Morgan as a human shield, but John Casey (Adam Baldwin) takes aim at his head. However, Jack manages to talk Klüg down {{for the sake of the}} bride's happiness.|$|E

5|$|The 1970 draft {{class is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} best in NBA history as it produced seven Hall of Famers and twelve All-Stars. Three of the first four picks were inducted to the Hall of Fame and seven of the first eight picks became All-Stars. The 1970 Draft is also known as the first draft where international players who had never played U.S. high school and college basketball were selected. In the 10th and 11th round, the Atlanta Hawks drafted Mexican Manuel Raga and Italian Dino Meneghin; both were playing in the Italian league at the time. They became the first two international players drafted to the NBA. However, neither <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> played in the league as the Hawks did not have US$35,000 to buy out either of their contracts with their teams. Meneghin, who played 28 seasons in Italy, has been inducted by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) to the FIBA Hall of Fame and also to the Basketball Hall of Fame.|$|E

25|$|Nina Gordon left Veruca Salt {{in early}} 1998. Post kept the Veruca Salt name because the pair had an {{agreement}} that if one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> left the band the other would get to continue using the name. Resolver was released in 2000, the first Gordon-less Veruca Salt album.|$|E
25|$|Chagall also {{designed}} tapestries which were woven {{under the direction}} of Yvette Cauquil-Prince, who also collaborated with Picasso. These tapestries are much rarer than his paintings, with only 40 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> reaching the commercial market. Chagall designed three tapestries for the state hall of the Knesset in Israel, along with 12 floor mosaics and a wall mosaic.|$|E
25|$|The old {{hotel was}} {{acquired}} in 2004 by Greg Vilk, a former tenant who had operated {{the last three}} businesses in the building. Vilk had sued previous owner Joseph Bujack for breach of his lease agreement and took ownership of {{it as part of}} the settlement. At the time of the transfer, Bujack owed over $308,000 in fines on the building. Vilk and his ownership group Kent LLC had plans to redevelop the building, but none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> materialized.|$|E

25|$|In 1973 they {{defeated}} the Orange Free State 30-22 in the final. This {{was followed by}} the 17-15 win over Transvaal in 1974 in a match in which Northerns centre John Knox had a particularly strong game. This match also started a very successful coach and captain combination. Thys Lourens, playing in his fifth final was captain of the side this day. He was to captain Northerns in a further 3 finals and in total play 8 finals - none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> on a losing side. A record to this very day.|$|E
25|$|Dureza, a dark-skinned grape variety {{from the}} Ardèche region in France, {{has all but}} {{disappeared}} from the vineyards, and the preservation of such varieties is a speciality of Montpellier. Mondeuse blanche is a white grape variety cultivated in the Savoy region, and is still found in very small amounts in that region's vineyards today. Both varieties are somewhat obscure today, and have never achieved anything near Syrah's fame or popularity, {{and there is no}} record <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> having been cultivated at long distances from their present homes. Thus, both of Syrah's parents come from a limited area in southeastern France, very close to northern Rhône. Based on these findings, the researchers have concluded Syrah originated from northern Rhône.|$|E
25|$|On 8 October 1942 387 {{people of}} Jewish origin {{were arrested and}} {{deported}} to Auschwitz. Only eight <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> returned. On 19 March 1944 allied bombing caused widespread damage and one casualty at the National Explosives factory. On 15 June and 14 August 1944, the railway station {{was the target of}} American Flying Fortresses that dumped a carpet of bombs with little damage to the Germans but killing 242 civilians, destroying 400 houses, and caused 5,000 disaster victims in l'Éperon, l'Houmeau, Madeleine, and Grand-Font districts. At the end of August 1944 the Elster column, which was composed of the remains of various German units and the Indische Legion, passed through the city without incident and withdrew.|$|E

25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E
25|$|Rachel {{discovers that}} Savage {{has had an}} affair with a juror {{in the middle of a}} trial of a gang member whom Nick was defending. She confronts him about it; {{realising}} that the revelation could destroy his career, he arranges for her to be killed. A man attempts to run down Rachel in a car, but misses and crashes. She attempts to apprehend the man, but he runs out into traffic and is struck and later dies. However, she discovers there is a link between the incident and her knowledge over Nick's affair. Murray arrests Savage, but in doing so learns that Rachel has used the PNC on Savage's vehicle months ago, an abuse of her powers. Murray informs her that her career is over, but Janet intervenes, informing Gill that she was with Rachel at the time and did not report the incident and as such, leaves her with the ultimatum that both of them should be fired, straining Gill and Janet's strong friendship. Gill, under much pressure, agrees to allow the misdemeanor to slip by unnoticed on the condition that neither <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> fails her again.|$|E
500|$|Frederic G. Kenyon argued: [...] "There is not {{the least}} sign of either <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> having been at Constantinople.

Others of his friends only relented after the death of the prince, who was by that stage King Edward VII.|$|E

(22 July 1907 – 16 November 1987) was a Singaporean {{composer}} {{originally from}} the Minangkabau highlands of Indonesia who composed {{the national anthem}} of Singapore, [...] "Majulah Singapura" [...] ("Onward Singapore"). A self-taught musician, Zubir also worked as a score arranger and songwriter for Cathay-Keris Film Productions for 12 years, composing numerous songs for the company's Malay films.

500|$|The {{outlying}} {{islands of}} Scotland incorporate {{those that are}} not part of the larger archipelagos and island groups of Scotland and are thus not listed as being part of the Hebrides, the Northern Isles or the Islands of the Forth and Clyde estuaries. None of these islands are currently inhabited and few <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>ever</b> were, although Hirta was occupied from the Neolithic age until 1930 and Stroma was permanently occupied until the 1970s and thereafter by lighthouse keepers and their families until 1996.
