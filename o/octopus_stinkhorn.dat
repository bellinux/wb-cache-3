50|$|Clathrus archeri (synonyms Lysurus archeri, Anthurus archeri, Pseudocolus archeri), {{commonly}} known as <b>octopus</b> <b>stinkhorn,</b> or devil's fingers, is a fungus indigenous to Australia and New Zealand, and an introduced species in Europe, North America and Asia. The young fungus erupts from a suberumpent egg by forming into four to seven elongated slender arms initially erect and attached at the top. The arms then unfold to reveal a pinkish-red interior covered with a dark-olive spore-containing gleba. In maturity it smells like putrid flesh. Recently, C. archeri var. alba with white tentacles or arms has been reported from the Shola Forests in the Western Ghats, Kerala, India.|$|E
