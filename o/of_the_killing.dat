5|$|Director Christopher Nolan has {{mentioned}} that The Killing Joke {{served as an}} influence for the version of the Joker appearing in the 2008 feature film The Dark Knight.

5|$|Officers in {{the field}} were well aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> {{operations}} being conducted by the Einsatzgruppen. The Wehrmacht tried to justify their considerable involvement in the Einsatzgruppen massacres as being anti-partisan operations rather than racist attacks, but Hillgruber wrote {{that this was just}} an excuse. He states that those German generals who claimed that the Einsatzgruppen were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying, and maintained that the slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless civilians for reasons of racist ideology cannot be justified.|$|E

5|$|On May 7, 2012, American {{officials}} {{claimed that}} they had thwarted another Al Qaeda plot that would have targeted a civilian passenger plane not unlike Northwest Airlines Flight 253. American officials stated that the attack would have involved a more sophisticated bomb, also planted in undergarments, {{and would have been}} deployed near the anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of Osama Bin Laden. Officials did not state whether any persons had been arrested or charged in their operation.|$|E
5|$|Suspicion {{moved to}} Beauchamp, {{as he was}} loyal to the Old Court Party, and was known to hate Sharp for his {{political}} principles. People knew of Sharp's earlier alleged involvement with Anna Cooke before her marriage to Beauchamp. Witnesses placed Beauchamp in Frankfort the night <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing,</b> and his host, Joel Scott, {{said that he had}} heard Beauchamp leave the house during the night. After presenting preliminary testimony, Commonwealth's Attorney Charles Bibb asked for additional time to assemble more witnesses. Beauchamp assented to the request. A second delay pushed the hearings back to mid-December.|$|E
5|$|The main voice castincluding Conroy as Batman, Sorkin as Harley Quinn, Valenza as Poison Ivy, and Wingert as Riddlerwas well received, but Hamill's {{performance}} received consistent praise, with reviewers commenting {{upon his}} excellent inflection and timing on a cackling, maniacal performance that steals the show.

5|$|Al-Qaeda {{confirmed}} the death on May 6 with posts made on militant websites, vowing to avenge the killing. Other Pakistani militant groups, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, vowed retaliation against the U.S. and against Pakistan for not preventing the operation. The raid {{was supported by}} over 90% of the American public, was welcomed by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union {{and a large number}} of governments, but was condemned by others, including two-thirds of the Pakistani public. Legal and ethical aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing,</b> such as his not being taken alive despite being unarmed, were questioned by others, including Amnesty International. Also controversial was the decision not to release any photographic or DNA evidence of bin Laden's death to the public.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{one-shot}}, {{the events}} <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Killing</b> Joke were adopted into ongoing comic book storylines. DC Comics officially retired Batgirl in the one-shot comic Batgirl Special #1 (July 1988), and when Barbara Gordon reappeared in the Birds of Prey series, {{she was in}} a wheelchair and became the computer hacker Oracle (this series was later adapted into a TV series of the same title). This event, along with a Batman storyline that takes place shortly afterward, , involving the Joker murdering Robin (Jason Todd), The Killing Joke, leads Batman's obsession with the Clown Prince of Crime to a personal level. The mantle of Batgirl would eventually be passed to successor Cassandra Cain and later, Stephanie Brown. Gordon's paralysis was later retconned into a temporary event that lasted only three yearsin DC Comics' 2011 line-wide title relaunch, The New 52, which saw her restored as the first and only Batgirl.|$|E
5|$|Anekāntavāda {{played a}} role in the history of Jainism in India, during {{intellectual}} debates from Śaivas, Vaiṣṇavas, Buddhists, Muslims, and Christians at various times. According to John Koller, professor of Asian studies, anekāntavāda allowed Jain thinkers to maintain the validity of their doctrine, while at the same time respectfully criticizing the views of their opponents. In other cases, it was a tool used by Jaina scholars to confront and dispute Buddhist scholars in ancient India, or in the case of Haribhadra justify the retaliation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of his two nephews by Buddhist monks, with capital punishment for all Buddhist monks in the suspected monastery, according to the Buddhist version of Haribhadra's biography.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the trial, FRAP members VIadimiro Fernández, Manuel Blanco and José Humberto Baena {{received}} the death penalty for the killing of Lucio Rodríguez, an armed policeman, in Madrid on 14 July 1975. Humberto had been an activist in the then-illegal Communist Party of Spain and had been arrested and jailed following a student demonstration in 1970. His parents claimed that he had been in Portugal at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> and that one of the main witnesses was not allowed to attend the trial. Though the prosecution had sought the death penalty for all five accused, Pablo Mayoral Ronda and Fernando Siera Marco received sentences of 30 and 25 years respectively. Lawyers of the three sentenced to death appealed the sentences.|$|E
5|$|Controversy rapidly {{surrounded}} Edward's death. With Mortimer's {{execution in}} 1330, rumours began to circulate that Edward {{had been murdered}} at Berkeley Castle. Accounts {{that he had been}} killed by the insertion of a red-hot iron or poker into his anus slowly began to circulate, possibly as a result of deliberate propaganda; chroniclers in the mid-1330s and 1340s spread this account further, supported in later years by Geoffrey le Baker's colourful account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing.</b> It became incorporated into most later histories of Edward, typically being linked to his possible homosexuality. Most historians now dismiss this account of Edward's death, querying the logic in Edward's captors murdering him in such an easily detectable fashion.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942, Heydrich {{was assassinated}} in Prague in an {{operation}} led by Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš, members of Czechoslovakia's army-in-exile who had been trained by the British Special Operations Executive. During the two funeral services, Himmler—the chief mourner—took charge of Heydrich's two young sons, and he gave the eulogy in Berlin. On 9 June, after discussions with Himmler and Karl Hermann Frank, Hitler ordered brutal reprisals for Heydrich's death. Over 13,000 people were arrested, and the village of Lidice was razed to the ground; its male inhabitants and all adults {{in the village of}} Ležáky were murdered. At least 1,300 people were executed by firing squads. Himmler took over leadership of the RSHA and stepped up the pace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of Jews in Aktion Reinhard (Operation Reinhard), named in Heydrich's honour. He ordered the Aktion Reinhard camps—the first extermination camps—to be constructed at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka.|$|E

5|$|In the 2015 {{video game}} , {{which is the}} sequel to Batman: Arkham City, while under the {{influence}} of Scarecrow's latest toxin, Batman hallucinates the Joker's shooting of Barbara Gordon after she is kidnapped by the mysterious Arkham Knight, a hallucination of Joker noting that he merely got lucky when he shot Barbara as he was ignorant of her true ties to Batman, and also claimed that he had actually been aiming for Barbara's head. In addition, the DLC side story Batgirl: A Matter of Family had various similarities to the story <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Killing</b> Joke, including Joker kidnapping and holding Police Commissioner Gordon hostage at a run-down amusement park as well as the backstory revealing that Joker had conned and murdered the original person who owned the park into granting him control.|$|E
5|$|Intensification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> {{operations}} {{took place}} in late 1941 when the SS began construction of stationary gassing facilities to replace the use of Einsatzgruppen for mass killings. Victims at these new extermination camps were killed {{with the use of}} carbon monoxide gas from automobile engines. During Operation Reinhard, run by officers from the Totenkopfverbände, who were sworn to secrecy, three death camps were built in occupied Poland: Bełżec (operational by March 1942), Sobibór (operational by May 1942), and Treblinka (operational by July 1942), with squads of Trawniki men (Eastern European collaborators) overseeing hundreds of Sonderkommando prisoners, who were forced to work in the gas chambers and crematoria before being murdered themselves. On Himmler's orders, by early 1942 the concentration camp at Auschwitz was greatly expanded to include the addition of gas chambers, where victims were killed using the pesticide Zyklon B.|$|E
5|$|Norman Osborn {{using the}} Green Goblin alias is as {{commonly}} described as Spider-Man's archenemy.

He was thought to be dead after that but writers help bring him back from the 1990s and he returned to plague Spider-Man once more in the comic books (such as being involved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of Aunt May) and other heroes (such as the Avengers). He is also an enemy of Spider-Man sometimes just as himself and not just only as his Goblin persona.|$|E

5|$|The Maratha cannonade {{intensified}} as the British redeployed. Although British artillery {{was brought}} forward to counter, it was ineffective against the mass firepower of the Maratha guns and quickly disabled through {{the weight of}} shot directed against it. British casualties mounted as the Maratha guns {{turned their attention to}} the infantry and subjected them to a barrage of canister, grape and round shot. Wellesley decided that his only option to neutralise the artillery and get his men out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> field was to advance directly into the mouth of the Maratha artillery. He ordered his cannon to be abandoned and gave the command for his infantry to march forward with bayonets fixed.|$|E
5|$|The Waterloo Bay {{massacre}} or Elliston massacre {{refers to}} a fatal clash between settlers and Aboriginal Australians in late May 1849 on the cliffs of Waterloo Bay near Elliston, South Australia {{which led to the}} deaths of a number of Aboriginal people, and forms part of the Australian frontier wars. The events leading up to the fatal clash included killings of three white settlers by Aboriginal people, and the killing of one Aboriginal person and the death by poisoning of five others by white settlers. The limited archival records indicate that three Aboriginal people were killed or died of wounds from the clash, and five were captured, however, accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> of up to 260 Aboriginal people at the cliffs have persistently circulated since at least 1880.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{was a popular}} comic book figure during the Silver Age of Comic Books, due to her appearances in the Batman television series and continued media exposure. She has achieved similar popularity in the Modern Age of Comic Books under the Birds of Prey publication and as a disabled icon. The character {{has been the subject}} of academic analysis concerning the roles of women, librarians and disabled people in mainstream media. The events <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Killing</b> Joke, which led to the character's paralysis, as well as the restoration of her mobility, has also been a subject of debate among comic book writers, artists, editors and readership. Viewpoints range from sexism in comic books, to the limited visibility of disabled characters and the practicality of disabilities existing in a fictional universe where magic, technology, and medical science exceed the limitations of the real world.|$|E
