30|$|This study {{captured}} {{the influence of}} cattle rustling on migration by use <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>dummy</b> <b>variables</b> that have showed different reactions to cattle rustling occurrences. The intensity of cattle rustling influences herders' decision to migrate positively and significantly (P < 0.01). This implies that severe, the herders are likely to migrate with their herd to safer areas to avoid loss from cattle rustlers. Likewise, the variable on whether a herder has lost livestock to cattle rustlers also has a positive and significant (P < 0.1) influence on migration. Herders that have lost livestock to cattle rustlers in the past {{are more likely to}} migrate due to cattle rustling or the threat of it than those who have not lost livestock before. The migration decision caused by factors related to cattle rustling is taken as a form of insurance against the vice.|$|E
40|$|This work {{analyzes}} the contagion effects between energy and CEE financial markets {{during the two}} crisis periods (global financial crisis 2008 - 2009 and energy market crisis 2014), using a sample of daily data from 2004 till 2015. We detect contagion by observing the degree and structure <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>dummy</b> <b>variables</b> for specified crisis periods included into the quantile regression models {{on the basis of}} a dependence measure called "coexceedances". Our results show that there are significant contagion effects present between the gasoil and CEE stock markets during the 2008 - 2009 period and mixed evidence of contagion between crude oil market and CEE stock markets. CEE stock markets do not appear to exhibit significant contagion effects with energy markets during the recent energy market crisis. These results substantially differ from those found in the developed European markets. In particular, our results indicate that energy markets and stock markets in developed Europe seem to display significant contagion effects during the 2014 - 2015 period.

30|$|The gender {{differences}} in occupational distribution can arise on account of several factors: differences in human capital characteristics, differences in “tastes” (e.g., in attitudes and aspirations), and prejudices of employers in hiring. We examine the role of these unexplained factors in occupational attainment in two ways. First, we estimate a model of occupational attainment for the sample of wage earners as a whole, using the method of multinomial logit. The explanatory variables include education, age, ethnic affiliation, family structure (represented by a set <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>dummy</b> <b>variables</b> identifying married persons with children {{up to five years}} in age and married persons with children in the age group 6 to 14 years), a dummy variable for head of household, and a female dummy. The coefficients on the female dummy indicate the importance of its direct influence (including differences in tastes and hiring practices) on a particular occupational outcome, controlling for the influences of the other explanatory variables. They also allow us to gauge the relative effects of gender on being engaged in different occupations. Second, we estimate a separate model of occupational attainment for men and then predict the occupational distribution of women assuming that it is determined {{in the same way as}} that of men. On this basis, the difference between the actual occupational distributions of women and men can be decomposed into difference that is “explained” by differences in characteristics and a residual “unexplained” difference that can be attributed to omitted factors, differences in taste, and employer prejudices.|$|E

30|$|More importantly, model 4 {{shows that}} the {{coefficients}} <b>of</b> the <b>two</b> <b>dummy</b> <b>variables</b> for employment status decrease sharply and are no longer statistically significant when total work hours {{is added to the}} model. This indicates that, after controlling for overtime work hours, the subjective well-being for all the women, no matter their employment status, is basically the same. In other words, the subjective well-being difference between women who work in the public sector, women who work in the private sector, and women out of the labor force can be attributed to a large extent to the difference in work hours. This result verifies Hypothesis 7, which suggests total work hours (especially overtime work hours) {{is one of the most}} important mediation mechanisms between employment status and subjective well-being.|$|R
30|$|In general, the {{estimates}} of parameters {{are in line with}} the usual findings; the significance and direction of dependencies is similar to those described for the selection equation of the Heckman model that we have used for the prediction of gross wages. Having a higher education and living with an economically active partner increases the probability of economic activity. In order to capture the effect <b>of</b> parenthood, <b>two</b> <b>dummy</b> <b>variables</b> corresponding to child-age categories are included (up to 3  years and over 3  years of age). The age of a child up to 3  years should catch the effect of paid parental allowance. It turns out that being a mother of a small child younger than 3  years of age significantly decreases the probability of being economically active; when having a child older than 3  years of age, the effect becomes positive. However, being the father of a small child of an arbitrary age significantly increases activity. Reporting chronic illness, being a student, or being a pensioner proved to have a significant negative effect on the probability of activity.|$|R
30|$|Explanatory {{variables}} {{also contain}} the control variables {{that are used}} commonly {{in the literature on}} remittances. Several variables are included. First, the variable “financing of emigration,” which {{takes the form of a}} dummy and indicates whether or not the household has helped his members to emigrate, is expected to have a positive effect on the probability and the amount remitted by the migrant. In our sample, among all migrants who send remittances, 60 % have received such aid. Second, we take into account the number of migrants from the same family because several studies have shown that this variable could affect the remitting behavior of migrants (Lucas and Stark 1985; Hoddinott 1994; Durand et al. 1996). It is expected that an increase in the number of migrants abroad leads to a decline in remittances if they are guided by altruism <b>of</b> the migrant. <b>Two</b> <b>dummy</b> <b>variables</b> are finally introduced to take into account both the difficulties faced by households and the characteristics of their community of residence. It is a question whether a negative shock that happened last year influences the remitting behavior. This “negative shock” variable reflects the fact that the original community of the migrant has recently undergone a remarkable shock which can have an impact on the income of its inhabitants (drought, flooding, lack of food, etc.). Several studies have shown that remittances can be a kind of private insurance which covers economic and environmental risks incurred by the community of origin (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2006; Gubert 2002; Calero et al. 2008; Agarwal and Horowitz 2002). In our analysis, we also attempt to test the possible link between the poverty rate of the community of origin and the remittance behavior of migrants.|$|R
