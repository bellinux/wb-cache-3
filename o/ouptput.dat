5000|$|His first {{project was}} to improve the Triumph Bonneville T120. Drawing from his success with Norton Dominator twins, Hele raised the power <b>ouptput</b> from 47 bhp to 52 bhp on open {{megaphone}} exhausts by careful modifications {{to the design of}} the camshafts and cam followers. Keen to keep the power gains for road and production racing use, he added a balance pipe between the two exhaust pipes where they exited the cylinder head adjacent to the ports, quieting the engine and allowing use of a less-restrictive silencer. A decrease in exhaust-gas velocity caused by linking each cylinder into effectively two silencers was addressed by reducing the exhaust pipe diameter from 11/2" [...] to 11/4".|$|E
