5000|$|The third type of lease is {{described}} as a novated finance lease or non-maintained novated lease where only the novated lease itself is salary packaged, with none of the <b>other</b> <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> such as fuel, insurance or maintenance being paid by the employer. [...] This arrangement is of little or no benefit to the employee as there is no change to the fringe benefit value, being based on the original purchase price, but any tax benefits on the <b>other</b> <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> are lost as they are not salary packaged. The effect of paying FBT or using ECM offsets most or all the potential tax benefits from salary packaging the lease rentals alone.|$|E

However the employee continues to use the vehicle as per the original terms of the lease. The employer will usually also pay <b>other</b> <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> such as fuel, insurance and maintenance.|$|E

During the evaluation of the database modelling stage of the approach, 15 real-world database schemas and logs were used. Similarly, our evaluation of cloud migration costs and duration compared the predictions of our database migration simulations to real-world migrations. On the <b>other</b> hand, cloud <b>running</b> <b>cost</b> accuracy was inferred from database capacity accuracy (for the reasons presented in the results analysis from the previous section). Real long-term experiments to assess this cost would be necessary to increase the confidence that this result is accurate.|$|R
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve their {{financial}} problems, the three friends decide to start a car polishing business together with the limited capital they have. However, at the opening ceremony of their business, Hui's mother collapses and is taken to hospital, where she is diagnosed with leukaemia. Hui has three wealthy older sisters, but they refuse to help pay the medical bills, and his application for financial assistance is rejected because of his sisters' high incomes. To compound matters, the loan sharks {{show up at the}} company to harass Ong. Ong and Hui ask to cash out their shares so they can pay the loan sharks and medical bills respectively, but all their money has already been spent on equipment and <b>other</b> business <b>running</b> <b>costs.</b> Hui's mother then dies and at her wake, which raises ten thousand dollars of 'bai jin' (contributions toward funeral expenses). The loan sharks turn up, pursue Ong and are arrested after a lengthy police chase. [...] Keong convinces his wife and daughter to enter an obstacle race where they win the first prize of S$100,000, which he uses to pay his creditors, and his family is reunited. The car polishing business is successful, and the three friends go on to become the directors of Autoglym Singapore.|$|R
40|$|Administration, red-light running was {{to blame}} {{for as many as}} 218, 000 crashes, 181, 000 {{injuries}} and 880 fatalities in 2001. 1 The problem plagues cities— where running traffic controls {{is the leading cause of}} urban automobile crashes—as well as rural communities. From 1992 to 2000, the number of fatal crashes at signalized intersections in the United States increased by 19 percent. Red-light running was the single most frequent cause of these crashes—equivalent to more than three times the rate of increase for all other fatal crashes during the same period. 2 More than half of those who died were pedestrians or vehicle occupants hit by red-light runners. The financial cost to the public was estimated to exceed $ 14 billion per year. 3 The California Highway Patrol estimates that each redlight <b>running</b> fatality <b>costs</b> the United States $ 2, 600, 000 and <b>other</b> red-light <b>running</b> crashes <b>cost</b> between $ 2, 000 and $ 183, 000, depending on severity. 4 Despite such catastrophic consequences, only a tiny fraction of red-light runners face any punishment for their actions.

In Soviet Union, share taxis, known as marshrutka, were operated by state-owned taxi parks. There are also individual operators in many countries. In Africa, while there are company share taxis, individual owners are more common. Rarely owning more than two vehicles at a time, they will rent out a minibus to operators, who pay fuel and <b>other</b> <b>running</b> <b>costs,</b> and keep revenue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first term}} is fully {{maintained}} novated lease, describing {{the most common}} type of salary packaging arrangement, where a finance lease is novated so the employer pays the lease rentals but also pays all <b>other</b> <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> (excluding the effect of employee contributions). [...] This terminology is confusing as outside of salary packaging, a fully maintained lease, describes an operating lease where the lease contract includes in the rental payments the fixed running costs of a vehicle or asset, such as insurance, registration, servicing and roadside assistance as well as some variable costs like fuel and tyres. The lessor simply hands back the vehicle at the end of the lease with the lessor assuming the residual value risk. There are usually terms in the contract with penalties or fees to protect the lessor from excessive costs and depreciation of the asset. Thus, a fully maintained novated lease is not a novation of a fully maintained lease.|$|E

The proposed museum {{was supported by the}} City of Manchester, the University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. In 1967, UMIST purchased 97 Grosvenor Street for demolition but agreed to allow one part of it to be used temporarily to start the museum. In 1968, the three authorities found between them £12,670 p.a. to fund a lecturer in charge, two technicians and a secretary was well as all the <b>other</b> <b>running</b> <b>costs.</b> Because he had been collecting exhibits such as the Beyer, Peacock archives of their locomotive production and many more, He was offered the post of lecturer in charge. The first stage of the museum was opened on 20 October 1969 by Hervey Rhodes, Baron Rhodes of Saddleworth, Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire. It contained displays of steam and internal combustion engines, papermaking, printing, spinning and weaving, scientific instruments, clocks, electrical exhibits such as wireless sets, archives and much more.|$|E

Similarly, OPEX was calculated multiplying the number of sites by the running cost per site plus terminal subsidies, considering that the migration of subscribers to the new network occurs in progressive stages during these three years. Note that only one terminal replacement per user was supposed in this study. Moreover, OPEX is increased with the annuity payment of a loan for CAPEX requirements over this period at an interest rate of 4 %.|$|E
40|$|A {{randomized}} controlled trial {{was carried out}} for 1 y in three tertiary and teaching hospitals, in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Yogyakarta (Indonesia) and Merida (Mexico), to study the effectiveness, feasibility, accept-ability and cost of kangaroo mother care (KMC) when compared to conventional methods of care (CMC). About 29 % of 649 low birthweight infants (LBWI; 1000 – 1999 g) died before eligibility. Of the survivors, 38 % were excluded for various reasons, 149 {{were randomly assigned to}} KMC (almost exclusive skin-to-skin care after stabilization), and 136 to CMC (warm room or incubator care). There were three deaths in each group and no difference in the incidence of severe disease. Hypothermia was significantly less common in KMC infants in Merida (13. 5 vs 31. 5 episodes/ 100 infants/d) and overall (10. 8 vs 14. 6). Exclusive breastfeeding at discharge was more common in KMC infants in Merida (80 % vs 16 %) and overall (88 % vs 70 %). KMC infants had a higher mean daily weight gain (21. 3 g vs 17. 7 g) and were discharged earlier (13. 4 vs 16. 3 d after enrolment). KMC was considered feasible and presented advantages over CMC in terms of maintenance of equipment. Mothers expressed a clear preference for KMC and health workers found it safe and convenient. KMC was cheaper than CMC in terms of salaries (US $ 11 788 vs US $ 29 888) and <b>other</b> <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> (US $ 7501 vs US $ 9876). This study confirms that hospital KMC for stabilized LBWI 1000 – 1999 g is at least as effective and safe as CMC, and shows that it is feasible in different settings, acceptable t...|$|E

5000|$|In Australia, salary {{packaging}} {{arrangements are}} often outsourced to third party salary packaging companies to reduce administrative {{load on the}} employer.

40|$|The Building Maintenance Cost Information Service (BMCIS) {{offers a}} {{comprehensive}} and rigorous framework {{for collecting data}} about the <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> of buildings. Nevertheless, it is pitched at such a level of detail {{that the amount of}} data collected and analysed may be constrained. This paper describes the deveopment and testing of a novel technique which reduces the amount of data to be collected without any unacceptable reduction in utility. It draws on the principle of cost-significance to create a simple model of maintenance and operating <b>costs</b> (together called <b>running</b> <b>costs)</b> from a rare and consistent set of data for 20 buildings at York University. The model contains only 11 elements, yet can predict the total <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> of each of four categories of building to an accuracy of about 21 2 %. It can also predict annual costs to about 7 %, despite variations in the periodicity of costs such as painting and insurance. The model was tested using the jacknife method and on virgin data. It proved to be extremely robust, predicting the <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> of 12 new buildings to within 5 %. The model offers a simple framework for collecting and analysing reliable and consistent data on <b>running</b> <b>costs.</b> Life Cycle Costs, Maintenance Costs, Operating Costs, Cost-significance,...|$|R
