5|$|Day 4–8 outlooks are the longest-term {{official}} SPC Forecast Product, {{and often}} change significantly {{from day to}} day. This extended forecast for severe weather was an experimental product until March 22, 2007, when the Storm Prediction Center incorporated it as an official product. Areas are delineated in this forecast that have least a 15% or 30% chance of severe weather in the Day 4–8 period (equivalent to a slight risk and an enhanced risk, respectively); as forecaster confidence is not fully resolute on how severe weather will evolve more than three days <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Day</b> 4–8 outlook only outlines {{the areas in which}} severe thunderstorms are forecast to occur during the period at the 15% and 30% likelihood, and does not utilize other categorical risk areas or outline where general (non-severe) thunderstorm activity will occur.|$|E

25|$|His {{replacement}} Neil Foster batted {{for over}} {{half an hour}} in making 6, a clear sign England's hopes lay in batting <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> However he too was eventually bowled by Alderman. Jack Russell brought up a deserved hundred, and whilst his heroics were in vain with no support around him, had the top order scored more the result may have been otherwise.|$|E
25|$|He {{is noted}} {{for being a}} fan of the singer Ayaya, so much so that it {{prompted}} a commercial where they appear together (although a surprised Kotoōshū found <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of filming that their parts were to be digitally melded). He often appears in TV commercials of yogurt products. This is because a Japanese dairy company, Meiji Dairies Corporation, sells a series of yogurt products under the name of Bulgaria Yogurt.|$|E
25|$|Back in {{the team}} for the series against Australia in 1979–80, he scored a hundred as a nightwatchman in Bombay. His innings of 101* in five hours nearly lasted <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> He had 17 catches and two stumpings against Pakistan in the same season and it equalled Naren Tamhane's Indian record for a single series.

25|$|Scattered {{contacts}} with Communist troops occurred over 3 and 4 November. The guerrillas depended on their air superiority and called in {{close air support}} strikes in these instances; they also utilized heavy weapons fire. The Royalists continued their sweep back toward their point of departure. On 5 November, the Royalists occupied Ban Naxain Noy, some 18 kilometers southwestward of Salavan. A resident stated that {{the headquarters of the}} PAVN 46th Battalion had moved <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> before.|$|E
25|$|There was no Currie Cup the {{following}} season, but Taylor still played three first class games, {{though he was}} relegated down the order. Against the touring New Zealanders Taylor batted at number seven; in a rain-affected game at Ellis Park, Transvaal hit 145 for eight in 29 overs, with Taylor slapping Tony MacGibbon, Bob Blair and John Richard Reid for 64 runs, 40 {{more than any other}} Transvaal batsman. Transvaal declared overnight, trailing by 71 runs, but New Zealand batted <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> for a draw.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} morning, MacGill {{came in to}} bat with Hussey, and {{departed}} in the third over having made four. McGrath was more stubborn, however, totalling 11 not out in his 28-over, 107-run stand with Hussey, who batted until lunch and made 122. The stand of 107 was an Australian tenth-wicket record in Tests against South Africa. South Africa then batted <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> scoring 169 in 58 overs with both AB de Villiers and Herschelle Gibbs completing half-centuries, while Andrew Symonds bowled the most overs of the three spinners with 13.|$|E

25|$|The Warriors {{could have}} gone second in the Pura Cup table if they had managed to force a win {{on the final day}} against the Redbacks, having earned a three-run first innings lead when Steve Magoffin had Dan Cullen caught behind for six midway through day three. Effectively 88 for three overnight, the Warriors lost nightwatchman Beau Casson and Adam Voges in the first session, but Marcus North and Dave Bandy batted out four hours in a 211-run fifth-wicket partnership. The Warriors batted <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> to draw the game, and were thus third, with a chance to qualify with a win in the final round at the Bushrangers.|$|E
25|$|The {{frustrated}} Australia team faced a fearless England side who challenged them {{at every}} turn, and recovered nicely {{even after the}} dismissals of Trescothick and Vaughan, who couldn't resist smacking a full toss from Katich straight to McGrath at the boundary. Vaughan was dismissed after 166 runs, which {{was destined to be}} the highest individual score in the series. Australia were also faced with a more defiant Ian Bell, who had struggled in the first two Tests. Picking up where Vaughan left off after tea, Bell, Kevin Pietersen and nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard closed <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> for England with the score 341 for 5.|$|E
25|$|The Australians {{got their}} third {{successive}} draw against a county side at Leyton, with Victor Trumper making {{a pair of}} hundreds. Essex lost five wickets on the first day, with Frederick Fane, Charlie McGahey and Charles Kortright all passing 50. Jones took four wickets as Essex could only add a further 34 on the second day, before Australia were bowled out 113 short; Trumper made nearly half the total, while no Essex bowler took more than two wickets. Three more half-centuries, from Alfred Lucas, Percy Perrin and McGahey followed before Essex declared, and Australia batted <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> for a draw, Trumper making 119.|$|E

25|$|Modi and Tikolo put on 35 {{more before}} Modi {{was out to}} van Bunge, who thus ended with the best bowling figures for the Netherlands, with his three for 51, while Tikolo was not out on 212, his second double century in the Intercontinental Cup. It left the Netherlands with a lead of 107, and as {{they did not want}} to give Kenya the 14 points {{available}} for the win, they batted <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> for a draw. Van Bunge ended unbeaten on 70, while five Kenyan bowlers got a wicket each, and when stumps were drawn on the final day Netherlands were 202 for 5.|$|E
25|$|Faced with an {{impossible}} 469 runs to win Australia {{had no choice}} but to try to bat out almost 9 hours of play. Lawry (21) added 65 for the first wicket with Stackpole who made 136 with 16 fours. It would have been 17 boundaries but the ball was stopped in the outfield when it hit a seagull, which survived the experience and flew away. He added 202 for the second wicket with Ian Chappell (104), who was dropped by Colin Cowdrey off John Snow early in his innings. When they were out in the final session Ian Redpath (21 not out) and Doug Walters (36 not out) saw <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> for 328/3.|$|E
25|$|The {{final day}} saw England only manage to take {{five of the}} eight wickets {{required}} for victory, but two of those fell to Anderson. Playing in his 100th Test match, Anderson first found the edge of Marlon Samuels' bat to equal Ian Botham's England record of 383 Test wickets, before surpassing it {{with the help of}} Cook at first slip to dismiss Denesh Ramdin. By that stage, the West Indies were seven down for 294 runs, still 144 away from victory, but with only 19 overs left in the match. England continued to press for the final three wickets, but Holder stood firm {{on the way to a}} maiden Test century, and he and Roach batted <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> to end the match as a draw.|$|E

25|$|The {{start of}} play was again delayed on day 2, but Samuels took {{little time to}} {{complete}} his century. However, he was out shortly afterwards, caught by Ian Bell at second slip off Anderson, and the West Indies were 223/6. Three quick wickets from Stuart Broad followed, taking Ramdin, Jason Holder and Kemar Roach, before a fifty partnership from Devendra Bishoo and Shannon Gabriel for the final wicket took their score to 299 all out. England had 26 overs left {{in the day to}} begin their response, and they managed to close <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> with both Alastair Cook – who surpassed Alec Stewart as England's second-highest Test run scorer – and Jonathan Trott still at the crease, reaching 74/0 at stumps.|$|E
25|$|Blignaut {{was strangely}} subdued for the 33 {{deliveries}} he faced, {{and although he}} did attempt some ODI-style heaves, they mostly missed both his bat and the off stump. Blignaut was eventually lbw for 4, but Keith Dabengwa {{came to the rescue}} with an entertaining 35 to bat <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> He yielded a catch to VVS Laxman at first slip off Irfan Pathan in the second over of the morning, however, as Zimbabwe only managed to add ten to their overnight score for the loss of three wickets. Pathan was the pick of the Indian bowlers, swinging the ball well to dismiss Gavin Ewing and Blessing Mahwire as well, as Zimbabwe were all out for 279 – with Tatenda Taibu left not out for 71.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand all-rounder Andre Adams {{then took}} two early wickets {{to dig into}} Yorkshire, who {{finished}} the second day on 53 for 2. The third day was calmly played by Yorkshire, as only Gough could take wickets – ending with four for 49. Yorkshire saw <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> well to end on 336 for 8, meaning that Essex {{would have to take}} twelve wickets on the final day to win the game. They only dug out seven – Tim Bresnan, Chris Silverwood and Deon Kruis frustrating them to build a further 72 runs overnight in the first innings, and following on Yorkshire easily withstood the spin of James Middlebrook who had to bowl 29 of 68 Essex overs, as Yorkshire made their way to 238 for 5 with Phil Jaques and Anthony McGrath making half-centuries.|$|E
