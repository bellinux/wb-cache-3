5|$|If {{the pain}} is still not managed adequately, short term use of opioids such as {{morphine}} may be useful. These medications carry a risk of addiction, may have negative interactions with other drugs, and have a greater risk <b>of</b> <b>side</b> effects, including dizziness, nausea, and constipation. The effect of long term use is unknown. Specialist groups advise against general long-term use of opioids for chronic low back pain.|$|E

5|$|The {{side effects}} of Adderall are many and varied, but the amount of {{substance}} consumed is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity <b>of</b> <b>side</b> effects.

5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine {{has been}} suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by studies.

Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy {{due to a lack of}} evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Dean applied to the US Military Academy, but was rejected.

5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk <b>of</b> <b>side</b> effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of rat and human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, mephedrone {{is thought to be}} metabolised by three phase 1 pathways. It can be demethylated to the primary amine (producing compounds 2, 3 and 5), the ketone group can be reduced (producing 3) or the tolyl group can be oxidised (producing 6). Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. Knowledge of the primary routes of metabolism should allow the intake of mephedrone to be confirmed by drug tests, as well as more accurate determination of the causes <b>of</b> <b>side</b> effects and potential for toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu {{enjoyed the}} higher speed of battle {{compared}} to Episode I. Parkin echoed these sentiments while also noted how mechanics such as Boost {{and the addition}} <b>of</b> <b>side</b> quest content made the game better than its predecessor. GamePro positively noted that the first game's mechanics had been made more approachable for series newcomers, while Massimilla felt that the simplified nature of the character growth system brought down the experience {{in addition to being}} shorter than other RPGs available at the time. Nutt felt that the alterations made battles far more enjoyable despite the character growth system lacking any meaningful customization options. Dunham echoed other reviewers' opinions on both the upgrades to battle and the reworked character progression system, in addition to the lack of in-game currency to buy items.|$|E
5|$|Febuxostat is {{typically}} only recommended {{in those who}} cannot tolerate allopurinol. Probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol and is a second line agent. Probenecid may be used if undersecretion of uric acid is present (24-hour urine uric acid less than 800mg). It is, however, not recommended if a person {{has a history of}} kidney stones. Pegloticase is an option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. It is a third line agent. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, and reduces uric acid levels. Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi but has a high rate <b>of</b> <b>side</b> effects and many people develop resistance to it. In 2016 it was withdrawn from the European market.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Fear of Music in 1979, Talking Heads and Eno sought to make an album that would dispel notions of {{the group as a}} mere vehicle for {{frontman}} and chief lyricist David Byrne. Drawing on the influence of Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the group experimented with African polyrhythms, funk, and electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of sampled and looped grooves, an innovative technique at the time. Recording sessions also incorporated a variety <b>of</b> <b>side</b> musicians, including guitarist Adrian Belew, singer Nona Hendryx, and trumpet player Jon Hassell.|$|E
5|$|Only 5–10% of {{levodopa}} {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier. Much {{of the remainder}} is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety <b>of</b> <b>side</b> effects including nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension. Carbidopa and benserazide are dopa decarboxylase inhibitors which do not cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, reducing side effects and improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One of these drugs is usually taken along with levodopa, often combined with levodopa in the same pill.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, several {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} on the bridge resulting in traffic congestion, and sometimes closure of the bridge for a few hours.

These are planned with a semi-circular layout in the form <b>of</b> <b>side</b> wings, which will facilitate easy flow of traffic, before the toll plaza, on roads leading to the Howrah railway station. There are also plans to improve the lighting on the bridge by installing LED lamps and search lights covering the four pylons, the bridge spans, cables and under-deck. An {{electronic toll collection system}} was scheduled to be introduced by 2014, to help improve the flow of traffic across the bridge.|$|E

5|$|The GCD can be visualized as follows. Consider a {{rectangular}} area a by b, and any common divisor c that divides both a and b exactly. The {{sides of the}} rectangle {{can be divided into}} segments of length c, which divides the rectangle into a grid of squares <b>of</b> <b>side</b> length c. The greatest common divisor g is the largest value of c for which this is possible. For illustration, a 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge (24/12=2) and five squares along the other (60/12=5).|$|E
