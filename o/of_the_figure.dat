5|$|There {{have been}} too few {{published}} studies on the etymology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> of Wade's Bel (whether that refers to his milkmaid wife or to the cow) to provide a firm etymological or mythological basis. Wade is firmly rooted in Norse mythology and there are parallels between Wade's cow/milkmaid wife Bel and the milkmaid figure of Beyla in Norse mythology, who some authorities have suggested derives etymologically from baula, meaning cow. There is no published work suggesting such a link, so the origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> remains unproven.|$|E
5|$|This {{was how he}} {{personally}} designed many of the Sagrada Família's sculptures. He would thoroughly study the anatomy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure,</b> concentrating on gestures. For this purpose, he studied the human skeleton and sometimes used dummies made of wire to test the appropriate posture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> {{he was about to}} sculpt. In a second step, he photographed his models, using a mirror system that provided multiple perspectives. He then made plaster casts of the figures, both of people and animals (on one occasion he made a donkey stand up so it would not move). He modified the proportions of these casts to obtain the figure's desired appearance, depending on its place in the church (the higher up, the bigger it would be). Eventually, he sculpted the figures in stone.|$|E

50|$|A {{group of}} five Madonnas {{ascribed}} to the artist show an ostentatious use of perspective foreshortening together with an almost geometric rigidity in <b>the</b> drawing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures.</b> <b>The</b> monumentality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> is further emphasized by the highly stylized landscapes in the background.|$|R

5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> in the background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve {{to make him a}} mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1763 {{descriptions}} of the giant appeared in contemporary magazines. The earliest known survey {{was published in the}} Royal Magazine in September 1763. Derivative versions subsequently appeared in the October 1763 St James Chronicle, the July 1764 Gentleman's Magazine, and the 1764 edition of The Annual Register. The Gentleman's Magazine account in particular was prominent, and contained the oldest known drawing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure.</b> In 1774, the antiquarian John Hutchins reviewed various previous accounts in his book The History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset. In it, he wrote that the carving had only been done the previous century.|$|E
5|$|Other folklore, first {{recorded}} in the Victorian era, associates the figure with fertility. In the past locals would erect a maypole on the earthwork, around which childless couples would dance to promote fertility. According to folk belief, a woman who sleeps on the figure will be blessed with fecundity, and infertility may be cured through sexual intercourse on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure,</b> especially the phallus.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe retinal {{image of}} a figure on a slanted picture is {{narrower}} {{than that of a}} figure on a frontal picture. In this study, <b>the</b> perceived width <b>of</b> various figures (horizontal line segments, ellipses, faces, symbolic faces, and artistic pictures) on a slanted picture plane was measured. <b>The</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> was magnified or reduced in order to vary <b>the</b> naturalness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>figures.</b> <b>The</b> perceived width was found to be much closer to <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>figures</b> than to <b>the</b> retinal images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slanted <b>figures.</b> <b>The</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>figures</b> was also found to affect <b>the</b> perceived width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slanted figures; the perceived width was observed to be more biased toward a more natural width. On the other hand, <b>the</b> naturalness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> did not affect the perceived slant. These results suggest that the visual system corrected <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> on a slanted plane, taking into the account naturalness or prägnanz as well as the slant...|$|R

5|$|The {{extraordinary}} survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> type, though {{interpretations and}} cult context shifted over the intervening centuries, is {{expressed by the}} cast terracotta funerary figure of the 1st century BCE, from Myrina {{on the coast of}} Mysia in Asia Minor, where it was excavated by the French School at Athens, 1883; the terracotta is conserved in the Musée du Louvre (illustrated left).|$|E
5|$|The obverse {{is similar}} to coins from Merovingian France, {{especially}} from the southern parts, as well as showing influences from Visigothic Spain. The reverse side, however, has no known predecessors in Merovingian or Visigothic coinage. Although by the late 6th century, Merovingian and Visigothic kings were putting their names on their coins, no surviving coins from either kingdom name a bishop. The design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> is derived from Byzantine imperial coins, and the cross itself is large and closely resembles an altar cross.|$|E
50|$|The {{material}} is then 'weeded' where <b>the</b> excess parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> {{are removed from}} the release liner.

5|$|A careful {{examination}} of Facsimile No. 2 {{shows that there}} is a difference between most of the hieroglyphic signs and the signs on the right third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> on the outer edge as well as the outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, to the rest of the text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially clear is the word snsn, in section 14, and part of the name of the mother of the owner of the papyrus, (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice on the outer edge. An ink drawing of the hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows these same areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and someone (the engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings papyrus for aesthetic purposes.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with an interest in the occult, who thought the zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago. But {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E
5|$|In this work, the {{inscriptions}} are in Roman capitals or Gothic miniature, and in {{some places}} seem to contain misspellings, making interpretation difficult. Its gold-lined frame and Latin inscriptions, with their subtle references to various passages in the two panels, indicate that the donor was wealthy and educated. The sides of each frame are lined with inscriptions from the Book of Isaiah (53:6–9, 12), Revelations (20:13, 21:3–4) or the Book of Deuteronomy (32:23–24). In the right hand panel, the wings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> of death contain Latin inscriptions on either side; on the left are the words CHAOS MAGNVM ("great chaos"), with UMBRA MORTIS ("shadow of death") inscribed to the right. A warning from Matthew 25:41 is written {{on both sides of}} death's head and wings, and extends from earth down into the hell section. It reads, Ite vos maledicti in ignem eternam ("Go, ye cursed, into everlasting fire"). In this way, van Eyck dramatically aligns the biblical extract in diagonal dual beams of light seemingly hurled from the heavens. Also in the section are letters reading ME OBVLIVI.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the painted}} {{production}} of Verrocchio's workshop {{was done by}} his employees. According to Vasari, Leonardo collaborated with Verrocchio on his The Baptism of Christ, painting the young angel holding Jesus' robe {{in a manner that}} was so far superior to his master's that Verrocchio put down his brush and never painted again, although this is believed to be apocryphal. Close examination reveals areas that have been painted or touched-up over the tempera using the new technique of oil paint; the landscape, the rocks seen through the brown mountain stream and much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> of Jesus bearing witness to the hand of Leonardo. Leonardo may have been the model for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of David in the Bargello and the Archangel Raphael in Tobias and the Angel.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the relief}} is in {{excellent}} condition. It was originally received in three pieces and some fragments by the British Museum; after repair, some cracks are still apparent, in particular a triangular piece missing {{on the right}} edge, but the main features of the deity and the animals are intact. The figure's face has damage to its left side, {{the left side of}} the nose and the neck region. The headdress has some damage to its front and right hand side, but the overall shape can be inferred from symmetry. Half of the necklace is missing and the symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> held in her right hand; the owls' beaks are lost and a piece of a lion's tail. A comparison of images from 1936 and 2005 shows that some modern damage has been sustained as well: the right hand side of the crown has now lost its top tier, and at the lower left corner a piece of the mountain patterning has chipped off and the owl has lost its right-side toes. However, in all major aspects, the relief has survived intact for more than 3,500years.|$|E
5|$|Stela 5 was {{situated}} {{at the base of}} Structure 1 in the East Plaza. It was carved with a rounded frame containing a figure in profile facing to the left. The figure is standing with the legs together and is wearing a feathered headdress and bears a zoomorphic head on its back, from which hang more feathers. The hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> are extended forward and appear to bear a staff of rulership. The stela bears a hieroglyphic panel with an incomplete dedicatory date that must fall within the range from December 740 to November 805. The text also contains the name of the king who dedicated the stela, Shield Jaguar, and the Emblem Glyph of El Chal.|$|E

5|$|The {{ceiling of}} the Sistine Chapel {{was to have a}} {{profound}} effect upon other artists, even before it was completed. Vasari, in his Life of Raphael, tells us that Bramante, who had the keys to the chapel, let Raphael in to examine the paintings in Michelangelo's absence. On seeing Michelangelo's prophets, Raphael went back to the picture of the Prophet Isaiah that he was painting on a column in the Church of Sant'Agostino and, according to Vasari, although it was finished, he scraped it off the wall and repainted it in a much more powerful manner, in imitation of Michelangelo. John O'Malley points out that even earlier than the Isaiah is Raphael's inclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> of Heraclitus in the School of Athens, a brooding figure similar to Michelangelo's Jeremiah, but with the countenace of Michelangelo himself, and leaning on a block of marble.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> are unclear. It is {{often thought of}} as an ancient construction, though the {{earliest}} mention of it dates to the late 17th century. Early antiquarians associated it, on little evidence, with a Saxon deity, while other scholars sought to identify it with a Celtic British figure of the Greek Hercules or some syncretization of the two. Archaeological evidence that parts of the drawing have been lost over time strengthen the Hercules identification. The lack of earlier descriptions leads some modern scholars to conclude that it probably dates from the 17th century, and perhaps originated as political satire.|$|E
5|$|GameSpot {{reported}} 4.2million {{units of}} Halo3 were in retail outlets on September 24, 2007, {{a day before}} official release– a world record volume. Halo3 broke the previous record for the highest grossing opening day in entertainment history, making US$170million in its first twenty-four hours. Worldwide, sales exceeded US$300million the first week, helping to {{more than double the}} sales of the Xbox360 when compared with the weekly average before the Halo3 launch. At the end of 2007, Halo2 and Halo: Combat Evolved were the number one and two best-selling Xbox titles, respectively, and Halo3 was the best-selling Xbox360 title. Halo Wars was the best-selling RTS console game, selling more than one million units. The Halo series went on to sell more than 27 million copies by August 2009, and more than 34 million copies by May 2010. Tor Books reported that sales of all franchise materials are greater than $1.7billion, and Bungie's games before Reach accounted for $1.5billion in sales. The soundtracks to Halo 2, Halo 3, ODST and Reach all appeared on the Billboard 200 charts for at least one week. By May 2011, total gross of Halo merchandise was $2 billion, with 40 million copies of the games sold. The total amount climbed to $2.3 billion in July 2011, and $2.8 billion in January 2012.
