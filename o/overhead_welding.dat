50|$|The torch {{used for}} lead burning is a small, hot, gas flame. Oxy-acetylene is most {{commonly}} used, {{as it is}} easily portable. A small size #0 nozzle is usually used, sometimes with a miniature torch body, but the torch is otherwise {{the same as that}} used for steel or copper work. A variety of fuel gases may be used, but to achieve the high temperature needed, an oxygen supply is always used. Fuel gases may be acetylene, natural gas or hydrogen. Oxy-hydrogen is considered to be the best, but is not easily portable. Oxy-natural gas is cheapest and is often used on fixed workbenches. As it is less hot, it cannot be used for some awkward positional (<b>overhead)</b> <b>welding.</b> Oxy-acetylene is the most common, as much leadwork is carried out on site and this is easily portable.|$|E
40|$|AbstractX 7 Ni 9 {{steel plates}} (13 mm thickness) were welded using two {{processes}} with corresponding consumables, the filler metals are ERNiCrMo- 4 wire and ENiCrFe- 9 electrode respectively for the {{tungsten inert gas}} arc welding (TIG) and shield metal arc welding (SMAW). After backing weld of double-sided synchronous TIG, the regular TIG and SMAW will be carried out respectively to process the filling welding. The microstructures and mechanical properties of two kinds of joints are analyzed, the result shows that the impact energy at - 196 ̊C in different zones of two joints reach to 70 J and more, the lower heat input of TIG is more favorable for improving the impact toughness of joints. And the weld metal strength is lower than that of the base metal, but the transverse tensile strength all exceeds the lowest limit of the base metal, it indicated that the weld joint can achieve equal strength matching. Furthermore, the double-sided synchronous TIG could reduce the work of <b>overhead</b> <b>welding</b> for X 7 Ni 9, the welding appearance and the welding quality could be improved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{prediction}} of welding parameters and weld bead geometry for GMAW process in <b>Overhead</b> T-fillet <b>welding</b> position (4 F) {{is presented in}} this paper. This welding position is applied in construction of steel structures and ship building. The task to discover the range of welding parameter that can deposit quality fillet <b>weld</b> in <b>overhead</b> position is difficult, {{and the cost of}} developing them by trial and error is high. Robotic GMAW welder is employed to weld in 4 F position with CO 2 shielding. The current, voltage and speed as parameters, wire extension at 13 mm constant. Only weld coupons are analyzed by macro-etching and the fillet geometry is plotted graphically to display the correlation with the respective welding parameter, particularly the heat input. Trend-lines with mathematical formulas are selected to develop the fillet geometry predictor. The predicted fillet geometry is validated by comparing with the values from actual welded coupons. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the predicting calculator is less than 1. 0 mm, it is therefore accurate and valid for industrial application...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} manual metal arc welders to reach target heat input (HI) values between 1. 3 kJ/mm and 2. 9 kJ/mm by varying weld travel speed was examined. Weld process data was {{collected}} during the downhand and <b>overhead</b> <b>welding</b> of 6 highly restrained quenched and tempered (QT) steel plates and {{the results showed that}} the measured average H I values were closely matched to the target HI. However, there was considerable scatter, particularly at higher H I targets, which warranted investigation. The frequency at which welders achieved their target H I (or travel speed) decreased at higher H I values, but nonetheless the standard deviation (SD) from the average HI was less than 10 % for all target HI values, which is well within the average 15 % deviation allowed for a qualified weld in the Australian Pressure Vessel Standard, AS 3992 - 1998. The effect of localised variations in voltage on H I was also considered. Even though voltage fluctuated by as much as 40 % during the deposition of an electrode, the overall impact on arc energy H I was considered negligible because of the short duration at these ‘extreme ’ voltages. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} levels of diffusible hydrogen marginally decreased as H I increased, which lends support to the fact that HI is a contributor to weldment cooling rate. Additionally, differences in microstructure and hardness were also observed between low (1. 3 kJ/mm) and high (2. 9 kJ/mm) HI values in the diffusible hydrogen test (bead on plate) samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{fatigue life}} of steel bridge {{structures}} is often governed by their fatigue performance. In many fatigue design standards, welded joints {{are divided into}} a number of different classes, each class having its own S-N curves for use in design calculations. In the fatigue design of bridges, the choice of suitable fatigue detail category is important to determine the life of the bridges. The fatigue design rules in current standards, at least most of them, are not really relevant to the design of orthotropic decks because they are generally meant for simple structures. For the choice of the detail category in the orthotropic bridge deck design there are certain difficulties and unsafeness for the designers because in such decks the stress analysis and classification of details are complex and beyond the scope of the standards. The aim of this master thesis is to theoretically analyze the fatigue strengths of the various joints, which typically occur in orthotropic steel plate deck bridges and box girder bridges, {{to be used in the}} design of these kinds of bridges by collecting fatigue tests that have been carried out by the researchers. Afterwards the results of the tests are evaluated and a summary of joint classifications emanating from these test results is set out in the tables. The orthotropic steel plate deck bridges are complex and sensitive to fatigue damage. Analysis of these constructions showed that the trough to cross-beam connection is the most sensitive link in an orthotropic bridge deck. Trough to deck plate connection is another sensitive welded joint, which is prone to fatigue cracking through the weld root as well as the weld toe. This joint is classified as C 71 with butt weld and C 50 with fillet weld by EC 3 (Eurocode 3). The results from the fatigue tests coincide with these classifications. The longitudinal trough stiffeners are usually fitted by positional site welding, for instance <b>overhead</b> <b>welding,</b> and their adequacy is therefore of great importance. The results from the site simulated tests showed that the butt-welded splice with a baking strip has the most sufficient fatigue strength. The steel box girder bridges are often chosen of their great torsional rigidity. Even though the steel box girder bridges are often stiffened by longitudinal welded stiffeners these construction are not sensitive to the fatigue as much as orthotropic steel bridge decks. If the crack propagation rate can be estimated reasonably well, this knowledge can give more efficient scheduling of repairs before the construction collapses totally. The test results showed that the box special girders that tested and analyzed have good resistance to long fatigue cracks, which can grow up to 1. 5 m...|$|E
30|$|Spray arc is {{required}} for thicker section than short arc. It is very suitable when a high deposition rate is needed and when deep penetration {{is required}} for welding of massive base materials that can tolerate high heat input. The large weld pool makes vertical or <b>overhead</b> position <b>welding</b> difficult, {{especially in the case}} of plain carbon steel and stainless steels. For joining steels, the transition current can be varied more than when welding aluminium alloys. A spray arc can be used with almost all common alloys containing aluminium and also nickel alloys, copper alloys, stainless steels, magnesium, and carbon steels (Lyttle and Praxair 1990; Althouse et al. 2004; Robert and Messler 2004; Goecke 2005 a, b; Jeffus and Bower 2010). Despite the advantages of conventional spray arc, odd arc instabilities and disordered metal transfer have restricted its adoption. In spray arc mode, the current and voltage are almost steady, which leads to random droplet size and frequency (Hutt and Lucas 1982). Therefore, high fume, spatter, and heat input are generated. As a result of insufficient control, the weld quality can be adversely affected. It should also be noted that the argon-based shielding gas used to achieve spray arc is more expensive than CO 2. In view of these drawbacks, spray arc is unsuitable for aluminium, structural steel, coated steel, and high-strength steels.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: When {{they are}} damaged by cavitation, {{hydroelectric}} power plant turbine blades must be repaired using operations that could benefit from developments in welding technologies. In light of this, the LABSOLDA welding laboratory at the Federal University of Santa Catarina is making efforts to enhance the flexibility and robustness of the powder-fed plasma transferred arc (PTA-P) process {{so that it can}} be used in any welding position and with different powders. The use of consumables in powder form in PTA-P welding allows experiments to be carried out to develop an alloy with special properties suitable for use in generator repairs. To this end, the RV-F PF powder feeder, which can operate with consumables with non-standard morphologies and particle sizes, was developed. The feeder was required to provide a regular flow of consumable material in out-of-position welding operations without the need for high gas flow rates and regardless of the morphology or particle size of the consumables. The RV-F PF is shown to operate efficiently with materials whose properties differ greatly from those of standard consumables. It is also suitable for <b>overhead</b> PTA-P <b>welding</b> and provides a constant supply of filler material efficiently with normal gas flow rates. The welding tests carried out involved deposition of a mixture of two alloys and were followed by cavitation testing of the resulting coating...|$|R
50|$|It is very {{difficult}} to achieve the highest standards of quality and safety using manual welding. This is due to certain <b>welding</b> positions, <b>overhead</b> and down-hand <b>welds</b> for example, often leading to faulty welds due to restricted access the user has in these welding positions. In order to have complete control over the weld pool, a perfect balance must be maintained between gravitational force and surface tension at every position of the torch.By using mechanised variants of the technique, certain parts of the welding process are handled by mechanical components. Note that a welder will always be monitoring and controlling the process. In an ideal situation, all welding parameters would be fully programmed before welding is started. In practice, however, the presence of variable constraints means that it is often necessary for the welder to make corrective interventions.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The major {{consideration}} {{of this study}} was the testing of the superiority of the whole or part method for developing basic arc welding skills. Data were also generated which facilitated investigation of: (1) the relationship of welding skill development to cognitive attainment of welding information as measured by welding proficiency posttest scores and written test scores, respectively; (2) a comparison of skill development among three levels of students grouped according to welding proficiency pretest scores; and (3) a comparison of welding skill development of students in separated and mixed (whole or part method) welding sections. Fifty-five students comprised the population for this study. Subjects were selected from beginning welding students enrolled in day or evening programs at Everett Community College during the Fall and Winter quarters of the 1971 - 72 school year. Students selected for participation were programmed through a 15 -hour practice session running flat and overlapping flat beads. Students were tested and paired according to similarity of welding proficiency pre-test scores. Pairs were split or arbitrarily assigned to the whole or part method of learning. Four welding sections were homogeneous; that is, contained only whole- or part-method students. All other welding sections were heterogeneous; that is, both whole- and part-method students learning together. Three welding positions, horizontal, vertical, and overhead, were selected as the learning elements used to test the whole versus part method of learning. That concept was implemented by assigning students to one of two sequences. Whole-method, experimental students practiced a total of 45 hours. The welding practice sessions were divided into three equal parts, time-wise. Each student practiced one-third of each session on horizontal fillet welds, one-third on vertical fillet welds, and one-third on <b>overhead</b> fillet <b>welds.</b> This schedule was followed until 45 hours of practice were completed. Part-method, control students utilized the following sequence: (1) fifteen hours of welding practice on horizontal fillet welds, then (2) 15 hours of welding practice on vertical fillet welds, and finally (3) 15 hours of <b>welding</b> practice on <b>overhead</b> fillet <b>welds.</b> Upon completion of a 45 -hour practice schedule, all students made fillet weld test plates in the three positions and were tested on the cognitive aspects of welding which were judged relevant. The welding proficiency and cognitive test scores provided the data for the statistical test of each of the hypotheses. Within the limits of this study, the following conclusions are evident concerning the hypotheses: 1. Whole (experimental) and part (control) method students demonstrated no statistically significant difference in the level of welding proficiency. 2. Students who scored highest on the pre-test demonstrated statistically significant higher welding proficiency post-test scores than students who scored lowest on the pre-test. 3. Whole-method students in mixed classes demonstrated statistically higher welding proficiency post-test scores than their counterparts in segregated classes. 4. There was practically no linear relationship or commonality between welding proficiency post-test scores and cognitive test scores...|$|R
40|$|Neste projeto foram realizados estudos do processo de soldagem plasma de arco transferido (PTA) com o objetivo de contribuir à soldagem em posições forçadas. A tocha de soldagem foi desenvolvida a partir de uma tocha plasma para keyhole, o que permite a utilização de dois modelos de bicos constritores de plasma com diferentes ângulos de convergência para a alimentação do pó, 30 e 60 graus de ângulo de convergência. Com isto abre-se uma nova perspectiva para revestimentos metálicos fora de posição plana e neste contexto se insere a recuperação por soldagem de partes erodidas por cavitação de turbinas hidráulicas. Com o objetivo de conhecer o comportamento do processo fora da posição foram conduzidos alguns experimentos com corrente contínua pulsada, utilizando-se a liga Stellite 6, e comparados com os resultados obtidos na posição {{horizontal}} e plana. A liga Stellite 6 vem sendo uma das mais utilizadas por apresentar uma excelente resistência ao desgaste por abrasão, erosão, impacto e cavitação. Foram avaliadas as características geométricas dos cordões, grau de diluição, dureza e microestrutura. Na posição horizontal e sobre-cabeça foram encontrados resultados inéditos, tornando o LABSOLDA pioneiro em revestimentos fora da posição plana neste processo de soldagem. In this Project, besides {{of producing}} an equipment of plasma welding with injection of powder (PTA), studies {{were done with}} the purpose of contributing to the welding in flat, horizontal and <b>overhead.</b> The <b>welding</b> torch was developed starting from a Plasma torch for the keyhole. Furthermore, the adaptation proyect allows the use of two constrictor plasma nozzles with different convergency angles for powder feeding. For this proyect, two models were built, a nozzle with a 30 º angle and another one with a 60 º convergency angle. With this, a new perspective is opened for metallic coverings out of a flat position and within this context it is inserted the recovery of the welding of eroded parts due to the cavitation of hydraulic turbines. With the purpose of knowing the behavior of the process out of position, some experiments were done with pulsed continue current by using the alloy of Stellite 6 and they were compared with the results obtained in the flat and horizontal position. The Stellite 6 alloy is being one of the most useful since it presents an excellent resistance to erode by abrasion, impact, erosion and cavitation. The geometric characteristics of the wires are evaluated, dilution degree, hardness and microestructure. In the horizontal position and overhead, the results found were unknown, making LABSOLDA the pioneer in recoverings outside the flat position in this welding process...|$|R
