5|$|Archaea {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial cell membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. <b>Only</b> <b>now</b> are scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.|$|E
5|$|In Bottomley's absence, {{his office}} {{explored}} {{the issue and}} resolved that Rhodesia could retain its representative in South Africa, but {{should not be allowed}} to appoint another in Lisbon; a consul was acceptable, they concluded, but only as part of the British Embassy staff. Bottomley remained unaware of this progress until a call from his office on 25 June, whereupon he still did nothing. Unwilling to wait, Rhodesia confirmed Reedman's appointment the next day, much to Wilson's fury. <b>Only</b> <b>now</b> was Bottomley finally jolted into action; he informed Salisbury of his ministry's findings on 29 June, offering them the consul within the embassy, but refusing to sanction an independent office.|$|E

5|$|Hispanic American nations from Mexico to Argentina {{suffered}} from coups d'état, revolts, dictatorships, political upheavals, economic instability, civil wars and secessions. Brazil, {{on the other}} hand, {{came out of the}} conflict with its system of constitutional monarchy strengthened and the cessation of internal revolts. The problematic province of Rio Grande do Sul had actively participated in the war effort. As a consequence, there was increased identification with Brazil among its populace, quelling of separatist feeling, and an easier and effective integration {{with the rest of the}} nation. Internal stability also allowed Brazil to begin assuming a respected place on the international scene, coinciding with the parallel emergence of the United States which was <b>only</b> <b>now</b> establishing its own borders. The European powers perceived in the Empire of Brazil a rare exception in a continent afflicted by civil wars and dictatorships. Brazil entered into a period of great economic, scientific and cultural prosperity, lasting from 1850 until the end of its monarchy.|$|E

Poor compensation and hours of work have reportedly resulted in a relatively high turnover rate among physicians in the system.|$|E
25|$|The {{head start}} that Robinson {{attained}} in the nomination process, {{and the fact}} that the Fine Gael candidate was from Northern Ireland, resulted in Robinson attaining second place in the polls.

She also obtained the backing of the Workers' Party of Ireland which was strong in Dublin and was considered crucial to getting working class votes.
