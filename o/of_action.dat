40|$|We {{present a}} method called Generalized Regression with Intensities of Preference (GRIP) for ranking a finite set <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> {{evaluated}} on multiple criteria. GRIP builds {{a set of}} additive value functions compatible with preference information composed of a partial preorder and required intensities of preference on a subset <b>of</b> <b>actions,</b> called reference actions. It constructs not only the preference relation in the considered set <b>of</b> <b>actions,</b> but it also gives information about intensities of preference for pairs <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> from this set for a given decision maker (DM). Distinguishing necessary and possible consequences of preference information on the considered set <b>of</b> <b>actions,</b> GRIP answers questions of robustness analysis. The proposed methodology {{can be seen as}} an extension of the UTA method based on ordinal regression. GRIP can also be compared to the AHP method, which requires pairwise comparison <b>of</b> all <b>actions</b> and criteria, and yields a priority ranking <b>of</b> <b>actions.</b> As for the preference information being used, GRIP can be compared, moreover, to the MACBETH method which also takes into account a preference order <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> and intensity <b>of</b> preference for pairs <b>of</b> <b>actions.</b> The preference information used in GRIP does not need, however, to be complete: the DM is asked to provide comparisons of only those pairs <b>of</b> reference <b>actions</b> on particular criteria for which his/her judgment is sufficiently certain. This is an important advantage comparing to methods which, instead, require comparison of all possible pairs <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> on all the considered criteria. Moreover, GRIP works with a set of general additive value functions compatible with the preference information, while other methods use a single and less general value function, such as the weighted-sum.
