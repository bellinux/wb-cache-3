50|$|A common {{misconception}} is that allopurinol is metabolized by its target, xanthine oxidase, {{but this}} action is principally {{carried out by}} aldehyde oxidase.

Allopurinol is almost completely metabolized to <b>oxipurinol</b> within two hours of oral administration, whereas <b>oxipurinol</b> is slowly excreted by the kidneys over 18-30 hours.

50|$|One {{treatment}} for gout in the 19th century was administration of lithium salts; lithium urate is more soluble. Today, inflammation during attacks is more commonly treated with NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids, and urate levels are managed with allopurinol. Allopurinol, which weakly inhibits xanthine oxidase, is an analog of hypoxanthine that is hydroxylated by xanthine oxidoreductase at the 2-position to give <b>oxipurinol.</b> <b>Oxipurinol</b> has been supposed to bind tightly to the reduced molybdenum ion in the enzyme and, thus, inhibits uric acid synthesis.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Allopurinol is a {{uric acid}} {{lowering}} drug {{used in the}} treatment of gout and the prevention of tumor lysis syndrome. Allopurinol and its active metabolite <b>oxipurinol</b> inhibit xanthine oxidase, which forms uric acid from xanthine and hypoxanthine. Therapeutic drug monitoring is an important option for evaluation and optimization of allopurinol treatment in case of renal impairment, interaction with uricosuric drugs or to verify patient adherence. In this study we developed and validated a simple quantitative assay using reverse phased high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV-detection as a method for quantification of allopurinol and oxipurimol in human serum in the presence of different frequently used drugs. Methods: The HPLC-UV method uses a mobile phase consisting of sodium acetate (0. 02 M; pH 4. 5), at a flow rate of 1. 0 mL/min. Allopurinol and <b>oxipurinol</b> are detected by UV-absorption at 254 nm with a retention time of 9. 9 min for <b>oxipurinol</b> and 12. 3 min for allopurinol. Aciclovir is used as internal standard. Results: Validation showed for allopurinol lower and upper limits of quantification of 0. 5 and 10 mg/L and for <b>oxipurinol</b> I and 40 mg/L, respectively. The assay was linear over the concentration range of 0. 5 - 10 mg/L (allopurinol) and 1 - 40 mg/L (<b>oxipurinol).</b> Intra- and inter-day precision showed coefficients of variation 1. 5. Exogenous purine-like compounds and co-medication frequently used by gout patients did not hinder the analysis due to the dichloromethane washing step or to low UV-absorpion at 253 nm. Serum levels of 66 patients prescribed allopurinol 300 mg/day were determined using this HPLC-UV method. Measured serum allopurinol and <b>oxipurinol</b> concentrations in clinical practice showed large variability with a range of < 0. 5 - 4. 3 mg/L for allopurinol and < 1. 0 - 39. 2 mg/L for oxipurmol, respectively. Conclusion: We developed an easy-to-operate and validated HPLC-UV method for the quantification of allopurinol and <b>oxipurinol</b> in human serum. This method was proven to be valid for samples of gout patients frequently using concomitant medications. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Xanthine {{oxidoreductase}} (XOR), {{a complex}} flavoprotein, catalyzes the metabolic reactions leading from hypoxanthine to xan-thine and from xanthine to urate, and both reactions {{take place at}} the molybdenum cofactor. The enzyme is a target of drugs for therapy of gout or hyperuricemia. We review the chemical nature and reaction mechanisms of the molybdenum cofactor of XOR, focusing on molybdenum-dependent reactions of actual or potential medical importance, including nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. It is now generally accepted that XOR transfers the water-exchangeable-OH ligand of the molybdenum atom to the substrate. The hydroxyl group at OH-Mo(IV) can be replaced by urate, <b>oxipurinol</b> and FYX- 051 derivatives and the structures of these complexes have been determined by x-ray crystallography under anaerobic conditions.

40|$|Introduction Numerous {{publications}} identify that gout {{management is}} often sub-optimal, despite detailed {{understanding of the}} pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder, the ability to establish the diagnosis with certainty, and the likely effectiveness of lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Barriers to successful gout management include diagnostic inaccuracy, a paucity of guidelines, sub-optimal patient education and patient adherence, co-morbidities and drug-drug interferences that complicate treatment of gout, and limited urate-lowering alternatives. Furthermore, a lack of information exists on the risk-benefit ratios of antihyperuricemic drugs for gout treatment. This thesis studies the clinical pharmacology of antihyperuricemic dugs {{in the treatment of}} gout in clinical practice, with focus on efficacy and tolerability. Studies and reviews of this thesis focus on: management of gout, outcome research with antihyperuricemic drugs, therapeutic drug monitoring of allopurinol, and rasburicase for treatment of gout. Management of gout In chapter 2. 1, we reviewed the literature on management of gout and presented a therapeutic strategy. Limited information on drugs indicated for the treatment of gout is available, making it difficult for physicians to make informed treatment decisions. The current therapeutic strategy is often based on clinical experience. Lifestyle advice is of limited value in the prevention of gout, particularly with regard to restricting alcohol, losing weight in cases of obesity, ensuring adequate diuresis and adhering to a low-purine diet, as most patients are reluctant to make such changes. Therefore, the condition is often treated with pharmacological therapies. Presently, oral colchicine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-choice agents for systemic treatment of acute gout. In the absence of contra-indications, NSAIDs are a convenient and well-accepted option for treatment of acute gout. In case of tophaceous or recurrent gout, the use of urate-lowering drugs is recommended. Allopurinol is currently the first choice drug despite its AE profile at the population level. Many of the currently available treatment options for gout have unwanted side effects highlighting the importance of emerging therapeutics for the treatment of the disease. Benzbromarone (chapter 2. 2) is an old, but very potent urate-lowering drug, and possesses some distinct, recently discovered pharmacological features, which are important for effective and safe use in treatment of gout. Although benzbromarone is on the market for several decades, its place in treatment of gout compared to allopurinol is unclear, because of insufficient trials of good quality. The toxicity of benzbromarone is generally limited, but serious benzbromarone-induced hepatic failure is reported in rare cases. The underlying mechanism has not yet been fully explained, but formation of reactive metabolites by CYP 2 C 9 resulting in mitochondrial toxicity, and CYP 2 C 9 allelic variants might play a role. Important drug-drug interactions may occur with CYP 2 C 9 -substrate drugs, but clinical data are lacking up until now. Outcome research with antihyperuricemic drugs In chapter 3, several studies concerning the efficacy and tolerability of antihyperuricemic drugs in the treatment of gout in clinical rheumatologic practice are presented. In 2003, benzbromarone was withdrawn from the global market. In the Netherlands, suggested alternative treatments were allopurinol (in standard dosage) or probenecid. We studied the market withdrawal of benzbromarone in gout patients in chapter 3. 1, and investigated the efficacy of two alternative treatment strategies: allopurinol (standard dosage) and allopurinol-probenecid combination therapy. A prospective, open study was carried out in 51 patients. Patients were given 200 - 300 mg allopurinol (stage 1); when allopurinol failed to attain the target serum urate concentration, sUr ≤ 0. 30 mmol/l (5. 0 mg/dl), probenecid 1, 000 mg/day was added (stage 2). We found that previous treatment with benzbromarone monotherapy (mean dosage 138 mg/day) resulted in 92 % of patients reaching target levels sUr ≤ 0. 30 mmol/l with a mean sUr decrease of 61 % compared to baseline. In stage 1, 32 patients completed treatment with allopurinol monotherapy (mean dosage 256 mg/day), which resulted in 25 % of patients attaining sUr target levels. Decrease in sUr levels was 36 %, which was significantly less compared to treatment with benzbromarone. In stage 2, 14 patients received allopurinol-probenecid combination therapy, which resulted in 86 % of patients attaining target sUr levels (after failure on allopurinol monotherapy), which was comparable to previous treatment with benzbromarone. Decrease in sUr levels was 53 %, which was a non-significant difference compared to previous treatment with benzbromarone. From the results, it was concluded that benzbromarone is a very effective sUr-lowering drug. Allopurinol in standard dosage was shown to be a less potent alternative for most selected patients to attain target sUr levels. In patients failing on allopurinol monotherapy, the addition of probenecid proves to be an effective treatment strategy for attaining sUr target levels. The results of this study stress the need for effective, evidence-based treatment strategies for lowering of serum urate in gout patients. In The Netherlands, the use of benzbromarone is restricted to gout patients allergic to allopurinol, or otherwise not treatable with this drug. The Dutch general practitioners’ guideline also includes patients who cannot be treated sufficiently with allopurinol. In chapter 3. 2, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of allopurinol (standard dosage) as first-choice antihyperuricemic treatment for gout, and compared the efficacy and tolerability of benzbromarone and probenecid as second-choice treatment. A multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial was carried out in 96 gout patients with a calculated creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min who were prescribed 300 mg allopurinol daily for 2 months (stage 1). In 82 eligible patients, 24 % attained target sUr ≤ 0. 30 mmol/l, and sUr concentrations decreased 36 % from baseline; 11 % stopped allopurinol because of adverse drug reactions. Then, 62 patients failing on allopurinol were randomised to benzbromarone 200 mg/day or probenecid 2, 000 mg/day (stage 2). After 2 months, 22 out of 24 patients (92 %) were treated successfully with benzbromarone, with a sUr decrease of 64 % on average. Treatment success with probenecid was 20 out of 31 patients (65 %), with a sUr decrease of 50 %. This study showed a poor efficacy and tolerability profile of allopurinol 300 mg/day to attain a biochemical predefined target level of sUr ≤ 0. 30 mmol/l after 2 -months treatment. Whether higher doses of allopurinol would increase treatment success, remains subject of further research (chapter 3. 4). In patients failing on allopurinol 300 mg/day, benzbromarone 200 mg/day is significantly more effective and better tolerated than probenecid 2, 000 mg/day. Serum urate is a well-accepted surrogate parameter for short-term evaluation of gout treatment. Furthermore, information on clinical outcomes, such as prevention of recurrent gout attacks and diminishment of tophi, is essential. A lack of long-term, good-quality, prospective data exists addressing the efficacy of serum urate (sUr) lowering treatment to prevent these clinical symptoms. We conducted an observational follow-up study (chapter 3. 3) to assess the rate of recurrent gouty arthritis in 50 patients with a history of recurrent gouty attacks, normal renal function, using antihyperuricemic treatment, and who completed a randomised controlled trial. After 10. 6 months on average, incidence of gout attacks was largely reduced compared to baseline rates: 74 % of patients were free of gouty attacks (100 % reduction), and 18 % of patients had 50 - 99 % reduction of gouty attacks. Serum urate concentrations were 0. 28 [± 0. 08] mmol/l. We found a high reduction in incidence of gout attacks, that was better than obtained in most previous studies. This might be explained by the good control of serum urate in this study. No correlation was found between reduction of gout attacks and sUr or study drug used, due to lack of power. We concluded that antihyperuricemic therapy is highly effective in reducing and preventing gout attacks in gout patients with normal renal function. In chapter 3. 4, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of allopurinol 300 - 600 mg/day versus benzbromarone 100 - 200 mg/day to attain a target sUr ≤ 0. 30 mmol/l. A multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial was carried out in 65 patients recently diagnosed with gout, who were randomised to allopurinol 300 mg/day or benzbromarone 100 mg/day (stage 1). When the target sUr was not reached, the dosage was doubled. After stage 1 treatment success was 8 out of 31 (26 %) with allopurinol 300 mg/day, and 13 out of 25 (52 %) with benzbromarone 100 mg/day. Overall treatment success with allopurinol 300 - 600 mg/day was 21 out of 27 (78 %), and with benzbromarone 100 - 200 mg/day was 18 out of 23 (78 %), a non-significant difference. In this study, dosage increase of allopurinol and benzbromarone did not affect tolerability. This study showed that efficacy of allopurinol (and to a lesser extent benzbromarone) in gout patients can be markedly increased with increasing dosage. The overall efficacy of allopurinol and benzbromarone was not significantly different. Therapeutic drug monitoring of allopurinol Chapter 4 concerns the therapeutic drug monitoring of allopurinol treatment. From previous studies it is known that antihyperuricemic efficacy of allopurinol is related to the serum concentration of <b>oxipurinol,</b> the active metabolite of allopurinol. Reference values of <b>oxipurinol</b> 5 - 15 mg/l (trough) are suggested, but poorly investigated. Given the poor efficacy results of allopurinol in literature and clinical practice, optimisation of allopurinol therapy is warranted. Therapeutic drug monitoring of allopurinol might be particularly useful in case of patients with renal impairment, oxipurinol-lowering drug-drug interactions, or suspected poor adherence. In chapter 4. 1, a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method with UV-detection (HPLC-UV) to obtain a method for the quantification of allopurinol and <b>oxipurinol</b> in human serum, was validated technically and clinically. The method showed acceptable performance on all major aspects of the validation (linearity, intra- and inter-day precision, accuracy, specificity, and lower/upper limits of quantification). For clinical validation, the serum allopurinol and <b>oxipurinol</b> concentrations in 66 gout patients were determined using this HPLC-UV method. Measured serum allopurinol and <b>oxipurinol</b> concentrations in clinical practice showed large variability with a range of < 0. 5 - 4. 3 mg/l for allopurinol and < 1. 0 - 39. 2 mg/l for <b>oxipurinol,</b> respectively. From these results, we concluded that the proposed method could be employed for the assay of allopurinol and <b>oxipurinol</b> in gout patients. Uricase for gout treatment Recently, a new class of powerful urate-lowering drugs has become available with rasburicase, recombinant uricase. Rasburicase is developed for the treatment and prevention of tumour-lysis syndrome. In chapter 5, the potential role of rasburicase in treatment of severe, treatment-resistant gout was reviewed, and explored in two cases. Future perspectives From the chapters 2. 1, 2. 2, and 3. 1, we conclude that a need for more evidence and education on treatment of gout exists, although the pathogenesis of the disease is well understood and antihyperuricemic therapies are available for decades. Indeed, (only) very recently two important guidelines have been developed: the EULAR recommendations on gout (2006) and the British guideline (2007). The - in some countries temporarily - withdrawal of benzbromarone made clear that this was not in the benefit of gout patients in general, because of scarcity of drugs for antihyperuricemic treatment. The benefit-risk evaluations of alternative drugs might not have been addressed properly, and better efforts might have been done for vigilance and understanding of the hepatotoxicity. Since allopurinol is the only drug currently available worldwide, {{it is very important to}} know how to use this drug safely and effectively. Chapter 3. 2, 3. 4 and 4, show that at least in patients with normal renal function, allopurinol often is inadequately dosed and that target serum urate concentrations can be reached with good tolerability by increase of allopurinol dosage and by optimising serum <b>oxipurinol</b> trough concentrations. In the end, good control of serum urate is associated with good control of gout symptoms (chapter 3. 3). Subject of further research is to what extent these findings can be generalised to patients with renal dysfunction, a large group in gout. This is important, because uricosuric drugs are likely to be less effective in renal dysfunction, and a need for optimisation of allopurinol dosage regimens according to renal function exists. Currently, new antihyperuricemic drugs have been developed for gout treatment: febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and pegloticase, a pegylated form of uricase. New drugs for treatment of gout are welcomed. However, the benefit-risk profiles of these drugs are not undisputed, since febuxostat is associated with liver enzyme elevations, and pegloticase with antibody formation. These new drugs might help management of gout, but more issues require attention to bridge the gap between clinical practice and potential treatment possibilities, such as optimisation of current treatment regimens, evidence of benefit of long-term treatment of gout on clinical outcomes, and patient’s adherence. ...|$|E
40|$|Summary: A {{method was}} {{developed}} for the simultaneous determination of hypoxanthine, xanthine, uric acid and allantoin based on isocratic reversed-phase chromatography. This HPLC-method additionally allows the direct determination with UV-detection of inosine- 5 '-phosphate, uridine, thymine, orotic acid, allopurinol and <b>oxipurinol,</b> besides hypoxanthine, xanthine and uric acid in the same Chromatographie run. Allantoin elutes in this system near the void volume and a fraction is collected covering the retention time range for this substance. After hydrolysis allantoin is converted to glyoxylate- 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazone, rechromato-graphed and detected at 360 nm. The coefficient of variation for this method does not exceed 5. 0 % for a serum concentration of 0. 3 μηιοΙ/ 1 hypoxanthine and is not greater than 5. 3 % for a xanthine concentration of 0. 3 μιηοΐ/ΐ serum. Recoveries were 90 — 110 % for both hypoxanthine and xanthine. The determination of uric acid had an imprecision and inaccuracy not exceeding 1. 45 % in the concentration range of 103 — 568 μιηοΐ/ΐ. Due to the more complex procedure required for the determination of allantoin, the coefficient of variation between days was 13. 6 % for a sample containing 0. 8 μπιοΐ/l allantoin and the recoveries for this analyte were {{in the range of}} 86 — 93 %. Reference ranges (mean ± SD) determined on 171 serum samples from healthy adults were 12. 7 ± 6. 6 μιηοΐ/ΐ for hypoxanthine, 3. 3 ± 1. 4 μιηοΐ/ΐ for xanthine, and 15. 7 ± 7. 9 μιηοΐ/ΐ for allantoin. No significant age or sex dependence was observed. Uric acid concentrations were 320 ± 55 μιηοΐ/l serum for men and 206 ± 55 μιηοΐ/ΐ for women...|$|E
40|$|Molybdo-flavoenzymes (MFEs), {{aldehyde}} oxidase (AOX) and xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) {{are involved}} in the oxidation of N-heterocyclic compounds and aldehydes, many of which are environmental pollutants, drugs and vitamins. This biotransformation generally generates more polar compounds that are more easily excreted, thus MFEs have been classed as detoxication enzymes. To date there has been scant study of the properties, substrate and inhibitor specificities of MFEs in non-mammalian vertebrate organisms. This investigation focuses on MFEs in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as it belongs to a class of fish that host a single AOX (AOXβ) and one XOR. In this study the substrate specificity of rainbow trout liver AOX and XOR was investigated using HPLC and spectrophotometric assays. AOX in hepatic cytosol was found to be able to catalyse the oxidation of azanaphthalenes belonging to a group of compounds that are environmental pollutants such as phenanthridine, phthalazine and cinchonine. In addition, xenobiotic aromatic aldehydes (vanillin and dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde) and drugs such as allopurinol and pyrazinamide were substrates. Several endogenous vitamins including pyridoxal (vitamin B 6), all-trans retinal (vitamin A) and N 1 -methylnicotinamide were also biotransformed by the rainbow trout AOX. In contrast to liver no AOX activity was detectable in kidney and gill tissue. XOR activity in rainbow trout liver was measurable with the endogenous purine xanthine, purine drug metabolites (1 -methylxanthine and 6 -thioxanthine) and N-heterocyclic drugs (allopurinol and pyrazinamide). Unlike mammalian XOR that can utilise both NAD+ and O 2 as electron acceptors, trout XOR was exclusively NAD+-dependent with no activity being detected with O 2. Eadie-Hofstee plots were using to determine the Km and Vmax of rainbow trout AOX and XOR with different substrates and it was found the Vmax of the rainbow trout enzymes were generally lower and Km generally higher than mammalian AOX and XOR. Inhibitors of mammalian AOX were tested to determine if they could interact with the piscine AOX. Environmental pollutants (17 α-ethinyl estradiol and phenanthridine), an endogenous steroid (estradiol) and drugs (chlorpromazine and menadione) were found to be effective inhibitors and were classed as competitive, non-competitive and uncompetitive respectively using Lineweaver-Burk plots. The drug metabolite, <b>oxipurinol,</b> was a non-competitive inhibitor of rainbow trout XOR. In order to further characterise trout AOX protein purification was carried out. In contrast to mammalian AOX, the piscine enzyme was not thermotolerant at 55 °C nor was it inhibited by benzamidine, thus heat treatment and affinity chromatography could not be used as a purification steps. Trout AOX was purified 210 -fold using ammonium sulphate fractionation, together with ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The native molecular mass of the piscine AOX was 295 kDa, which is similar to mammalian AOXs. In conclusion this study yields new insight into groups of anthropogenic environmental pollutants, drugs and vitamins that are substrates and inhibitors of an ancestral vertebrate AOX. The toxicological relevance of these findings is discussed...|$|E
