5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother {{who has spent}} many an hour {{hovering}} over my son with a thermometer and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't {{want to go out}} for dinner with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew in the care of their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl <b>of</b> <b>pasta</b> and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011 Austrian pastafarian Niko Alm won {{the legal}} right to be shown in his driving license photo wearing a pasta {{strainer}} on his head, after three years spent pursuing permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive. He got the idea after reading that Austrian regulations allow headgear in official photos only when it is worn for religious reasons. Some sources report that the colander in the form <b>of</b> <b>pasta</b> strainer, was recognised by Austrian authorities as a religious headgear of the parody religion Pastafarianism in 2011. This was denied by Austrian authorities, saying that religious motives were not the reason to grant the permission of wearing the headgear in a passport.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with a {{scene of}} the band {{beginning}} to perform the song in a house's detached garage. When the first verse starts, Stefani's ex-lover (Terry Hall) walks by the house before sitting down on a swing. Stefani changes her shoes as the song's chorus is played; she walks away from the garage and down a street to a grocery store. At the store, she purchases four cans of tomato sauce, and quickly leaves. Meanwhile, Dumont, Kanal, and Young prepare a large dinner for the band as Stefani reenters the home. Stefani slices tomatoes, Dumont cooks some spaghetti noodles, Kanal cuts up a few onions, and Young sets the table. At the song's bridge, Stefani accidentally cuts herself with a knife and Kanal drops a pot <b>of</b> <b>pasta</b> sauce; both of them promptly clean up their messes as dinner is served. Dumont initiates a food fight, and touring members Gabrial McNair and Stephen Bradley join in. The video ends with the ex-lover sitting alone on the swing.|$|E

25|$|The storage <b>of</b> <b>pasta</b> {{depends on}} how far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type <b>of</b> <b>pasta.</b> Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E

40|$|In {{supernova}} cores and {{neutron star}} crusts, nuclei with exotic shapes such as rod-like and slab-like nuclei {{are expected to}} exist. These nuclei are collectively called nuclear "pasta". For the past decades, existence <b>of</b> the <b>pasta</b> phases in the equilibrium state has been studied using various methods. Recently, the formation process <b>of</b> the <b>pasta</b> phases, {{which has been a}} long-standing problem, has been unveiled using molecular dynamics simulations.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aimed to {{characterize}} millet-pomace based pasta {{on the basis}} of functional, morphological, pasting and nutritional properties with control pasta (100 % durum semolina). Functional pasta was developed by using blend of 20 % finger millet flour, 12 % pearl millet flour, 4 % carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) and 64 % composite flour containing durum semolina and carrot pomace. Nutritional analysis <b>of</b> developed <b>pasta</b> showed high content of minerals viz calcium, iron, zinc and dietary fiber compared to control pasta. The developed pasta showed better quality characteristics in terms of cooked weight, swelling index and water absorption. Color evaluation <b>of</b> developed <b>pasta</b> showed increase in L∗ and b∗ values. Phenolic content and antioxidant activity <b>of</b> developed <b>pasta</b> was significantly higher with respect to control. Also significant (p< 0. 05) variations were observed in pasting properties between pasta samples.

25|$|In North Africa, a food {{similar to}} pasta, known as couscous, has been eaten for centuries. However, {{it lacks the}} {{distinguishing}} malleable nature <b>of</b> <b>pasta,</b> couscous being more akin to droplets of dough. At first, dry pasta was a luxury item in Italy because of high labor costs; durum wheat semolina had to be kneaded for a long time.|$|E
25|$|Also {{commonly}} {{used to refer to}} the variety <b>of</b> <b>pasta</b> dishes, pasta is typically a noodle made from an unleavened dough of a durum wheat flour mixed with water or eggs and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Pastas may be divided into two broad categories, dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca).|$|E
25|$|Both {{dried and}} fresh pasta {{come in a}} number of shapes and varieties, with 310 {{specific}} forms known variably by over 1300 names having been documented. In Italy the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary with locale. For example, the form cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending on region and town. Common forms <b>of</b> <b>pasta</b> include long shapes, short shapes, tubes, flat shapes and sheets, miniature soup shapes, filled or stuffed and specialty or decorative shapes. As a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes. As pasta asciutta (or pastasciutta) cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary sauce or condiment. A second classification <b>of</b> <b>pasta</b> dishes is pasta in brodo in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is pasta al forno in which the pasta incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked.|$|E
