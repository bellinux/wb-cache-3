5|$|A common Palestinian dessert {{reserved}} {{only for}} Ramadan is qatayef, {{which could be}} provided by the numerous street vendors in several major Palestinian cities or towns as well as typical Palestinian households. Qatayef is the general name of the dessert as a whole, but more specifically, the name of the batter that acts as a base. The result of the batter being poured into a round hot plate appears similar to pancakes, except <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> is cooked, then folded. The pastry is filled with either unsalted goat cheese or ground walnuts and cinnamon. It is then baked and served with a hot sugar-water syrup or sometimes honey.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{during this}} time of {{increased}} media publicity of the controversy, public health officials and institutions did little to rebut the concerns and speculative theories being offered. Media attention and polarization of the debate has also been fueled by personal injury lawyers who took out full-page ads in prominent newspapers and offered financial support for expert witnesses who dissented from the scientific consensus {{that there is no}} convincing evidence for a link between thiomersal and autism. Paul Offit, a leading vaccine researcher and advocate, has said that the media has a tendency to provide false balance by perpetually presenting both sides of an issue even when <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> is supported by the evidence and thereby giving a platform for the spread of misinformation.|$|E
5|$|Most {{molluscs}} {{have only}} one pair of gills, or even only one gill. Generally, the gills are rather like feathers in shape, although some species have gills with filaments on <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>side.</b> They divide the mantle cavity so water enters near the bottom and exits near the top. Their filaments have three kinds of cilia, one of which drives the water current through the mantle cavity, while the other two help to keep the gills clean. If the osphradia detect noxious chemicals or possibly sediment entering the mantle cavity, the gills' cilia may stop beating until the unwelcome intrusions have ceased. Each gill has an incoming blood vessel connected to the hemocoel and an outgoing one to the heart.|$|E

5|$|About twenty {{teeth and}} a jaw {{fragment}} have {{been referred to}} Ferugliotherium, but the assignment {{of many of these}} is controversial or has been superseded. The upper and lower incisors are long and rodent-like and have enamel on <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the crown. A fragment of the lower jaw shows that the tooth socket of the lower incisor was very long, extending below the fourth premolar (p4). The p4 is preserved in this fragment. It is blade-shaped and resembles multituberculate p4s. However, the determination of this fossil as Ferugliotherium is in question. The identity of a few additional isolated premolars assigned to Ferugliotherium, some resembling multituberculates, is also uncertain. The first lower molariform (molar-like tooth; mf1) is known from four examples, of which two were originally identified as upper molars of a different species (Vucetichia gracilis), which is now considered a synonym of Ferugliotherium. They bear two longitudinal rows of three or four cusps and transverse crests and furrows. A single example each of the second lower (mf2) and first upper molariform (MF1) show that these teeth also had longitudinal cusp rows and transverse furrows and crests, but the mf2 had only two or perhaps three cusps per row and the MF1 had three longitudinal rows.|$|E

The correlations include four kinds: benefit to each other, contradiction to each other, benefit <b>only</b> to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> and damage <b>only</b> to <b>one</b> <b>side.</b> In order to achieve well harmonization among economy, society, environment and resources, and promote sustainable development of economy around Leqing bay, the integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) must be implemented...|$|R
5000|$|As the {{crankcase}} {{became more}} important for lubrication, the layout was simpler if steam pressure was <b>only</b> applied to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the cylinder. This has a second advantage: as the steam's force is now <b>only</b> on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the piston, the force on the bearings will still vary through the stroke, but it no longer reverses its direction. This reduces the effects of any bearing slop at high speed.|$|R

It closed on 11 September 1939, but {{was used as a}} passing loop afterwards. Since the line was closed and the tracks to Boulby Potash Mine were relaid, the station has been completely dismantled.|$|R

25|$|The {{cassette}} {{was adapted}} {{into what is}} called a streamer cassette, a version dedicated solely for data storage, and used chiefly for hard disk backups and other types of data. Streamer cassettes look almost exactly the same as a standard cassette, with the exception of having a notch about one quarter-inch wide and deep situated slightly off-center at the top edge of the cassette. Streamer cassettes also have a re-usable write-protect tab on <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the top edge of the cassette, with {{the other side of the}} top edge having either only an open rectangular hole, or no hole at all. This is due to the entire one-eighth inch width of the tape loaded inside being used by a streamer cassette drive for the writing and reading of data, hence <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the cassette being used. Streamer cassettes can hold anywhere from 50 to 160 megabytes of data.|$|E
