In order to meet the finding purpose, a questionnaire surveys was conducted for this study. There is a total of 205 complete questionnaires collected. All respondents were picked from the Operational department of both IBM Sdn. Bhd. and HP Sdn. Bhd. to make a comparison between employees/respondents of the same working background. Results of the survey demonstrated that high performance work culture and participative leadership in an organization has positive relationship with employee’s innovation work behaviour and innovative output. ...|$|E

On sites where an objective can be met without viewing more than one page, for example on websites sharing specific knowledge on some subject (dictionary entry, specific recipe), the bounce rate would not be as meaningful for determining conversion success. In contrast, the bounce rate of an e-commerce site could be interpreted in correlation with the purchase conversion rate, providing the bounces are considered representative of visits where no purchase was made. Typically, an average Bounce Rate for e-commerce is around 60%, with top performers operating at a 36% average Bounce Rate.|$|R

Different architectures are compared, taking into account the real-time environment, the logical and physical distribution of hardware and software, the allocation of functions to the subsystems and the communication between sensors, controllers and actuators. We argue that a global approach to dependability will be necessary to cope with the awaited functional integration. 1 Introduction During the last thirty years more and more computer systems have been introduced into the automobile, improving comfort and performance, reducing exhaust pollutants and fuel consumption as well as [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Mild {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI) is an operational definition for a cognitive decline in {{individuals with a}} greater risk of developing dementia. The amnestic subtype of MCI is of particular interest because these individuals most likely progress to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Currently hypothesised therapeutic approaches in MCI are mainly based on AD treatment strategies. Long term secondary prevention randomised clinical trials have been completed in amnestic MCI populations, encompassing agents with various mechanisms of action: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), antioxidants (vitamin E), anti-inflammatories (rofecoxib), and nootropics (piracetam). The design of clinical trials in MCI is influenced by study <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> <b>definition</b> of primary end points: time to clinical diagnosis of dementia, and AD in particular, or symptom progression. As none of the drugs previously shown to have clinical efficacy in AD trials or benefit in everyday practice have met the primary objectives of the respective trials, design of future clinical trials in MCI should be further developed particularly as regards the selection of more homogeneous samples at entry, optimal treatment duration, and multidimensional and reliable outcomes.

40|$|This article explores {{how human}} {{resource}} (HR) managers discuss, classify and justify age diversity {{as both a}} concept and practice within the UK. The findings from 33 in-depth interviews with HR managers reveal difficulty in translating age diversity as an abstract managerial concept into workfloor policy and practice. Whilst the managers sought to emphasise the role of culture in promoting diversity, {{there was a lack}} of evidence that this related to workfloor equality or activities that proactively challenge discrimination. Moreover, there was confusion over classifying older workers as ‘diverse’, and risking possible discriminatory practices which marginalised both the older workers and other employees. The conclusions discuss how the ambiguous concept of ‘difference’ which lies at the basis of understanding both diversity and discrimination caused tension when implementing older worker strategies, and how policy makers must provide clear measures concerning the intent, <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> surrounding age equality. It is argued that a move towards an action model of discrimination management may help to create a framework where diversity and discrimination can be mutually addressed...|$|R

Seven objective income-based definitions of social class are contrasted with a self-perceived social status measure. Mismatches between the <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> subjective classifications are largest when the objective definition is based on median incomes. Mismatches arise because self-perceived social status is associated not just with income, but also with personal capabilities, interpersonal relations, financial and material assets, and perceptions of economic insecurity. Objective definitions of the middle class based on absolute incomes provide the fewest mismatches and the most accurate differentiation of the middle class from other classes. ...|$|R

Though {{the notion of}} the notion of meaningfulness is central to occupational therapy practice (AOTA, 2008), it has never really been investigated in depth in the profession's literature This book is aimed at occupational therapy and occupational science students, occupational therapy clinicians, and occupational scientists. Each chapter begins with learning objectives, personal growth <b>objectives,</b> <b>and</b> <b>definition</b> of key terms, followed by the content, and finally by self-exploration exercise. This approach makes the book applicable to students who are studying the relationship between occupation and meaningful living. The exercises are experiential making it possible for people to apply these concepts in their own lives. This is a unique, new approach which has not been used much in occupational therapy and occupational science literature before. The approach has been tested by the authors teaching experience on the philosophical and theoretical foundaitons of occupational therapy and the therapeutic use of self. About the authors Moses N.

Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) characterizes risk in terms of three questions: (1) What can go wrong? (2) How likely is it? (3) What are the consequences? Probabilistic Risk Assessment studies answer these questions by systematically postulating and quantifying undesired scenarios in a highly integrated, top down fashion. The PRA process for technological systems typically includes the following steps: <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> scope <b>definition,</b> system familiarization, identification of initiating events, scenario modeling, quantification, uncertainty analysis, sensitivity analysis, importance ranking, and data analysis. Fault trees and event trees are widely used tools for risk scenario analysis in PRAs of technological systems. This methodology is most suitable for systems made of hardware components. A more comprehensive treatment of risks of technical systems needs to consider the entire environment within which such systems are designed and operated. This environment includes the physical environment, the socio-economic environment, and in some cases the regulatory and oversight environment. The technical system...|$|R
