5|$|A {{few days}} after the murders, the Ministry of Interior {{announced}} its deliberation about making the gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order to give them the ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms. This was, however, rejected by psychiatric associations. They argued that psychiatrists' main goal is to cure patients, and that potential patients {{may be more likely to}} avoid psychiatric treatment for fear <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> their gun license.|$|E

5|$|Extravagant {{to a great}} degree, Ernest {{had many}} money {{troubles}} throughout his reign. In January 1848, Ernest visited his brother {{in the midst of}} political unrest in Germany. Upon his return, he also discovered unrest in Coburg. One of the many concerns related to finances. Although Ernest had a large inheritance, he also had frequent debts.

5|$|However, {{the fall}} of the Raevsky redoubt did not have much meaning. The Russian troops {{successfully}} moved to the rear without being destroyed (despite suffering heavy losses). So, in spite <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> some areas in the battlefield, the Russian formation was prevented from collapsing. On the French side, the gain of the Raevsky redoubt cost them large casualties and, after that, Napoleon himself ordered his troops to retreat to the starting line. The Russians then reoccupied their previous positions.|$|E

Polygon wrote that while this mechanic is acceptable, the act <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> all equipped upgrades upon losing a single heart was harsh.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{possible}} ways of improving sensitivity and repeatability of determination of cadmium by EcHG - ETAAS. The main complication of this coupled method is condensation of water vapors in the transport capillary, which takes {{part in the}} losses of the volatile form of cadmium. Possible solution or at least restriction of the above mentioned problem is heating of the transport route. Experiments also show that reducing the ratio area/volume of transport capillary doesn't lead to reduction <b>of</b> <b>loses</b> <b>of</b> the volatile form of cadmium...|$|R
