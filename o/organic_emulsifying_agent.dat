Nanodispersion of polymeric particles prepared by the emulsion-solvent distribution method was concentrated by using a novel method of facilitated dialysis. The concentration of dispersion by this method {{is influenced by the}} selection of <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent</b> and stabilizer, its concentration, and by the quantity of superabsorption polyacrylate copolymer and its arrangement in the dialysis tubings. The novel research findings concerning the utility of very low concentrations of <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> and {{the influence}} of <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> on the stability of nanoparticles, alternatively on their solubilization, or aggregation process were obtained...|$|R

40|$|AbstractResearch on {{rheological}} behavior {{of crude oil}} emulsion is vital due to complex behavior of crude oil. Usually, crude oil emulsion is found in mixed state with solid particles, <b>organic</b> additives and <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents.</b> Crude oil emulsion can be encountered during oil production, transporting or processing. The production of emulsion is a costly problem {{both in terms of}} chemicals usage to overcome the problem and production loses. In order to get a better understanding on rheological behaviour of crude oil emulsion, the rheological study of water in oil emulsion was investigated. The present paper deals with the rheological study of light crude oil from Bintulu, Sarawak and its mixture with water. This rheological study includes viscosity dependence vs. shear rate, temperature and volume water ratio. Water in oil emulsions were prepared by mixing light crude oil with different water volume fractions (20 %, 30 % and 40 %). Rheological measurements were carried out by Antoon Paar MCR 301 rheometer operated at pressure of 2. 5 bar. The results showed that emulsion exhibit non-Newtonian flow behavior at low shear rate and Newtonian flow behaviour at high shear rate. Besides that, viscosity of water in oil emulsion was strongly augmented by increasing volume of water and decreased the temperature. It was noted that a large discontinuity in the viscosity occurs at volume water ratio of 30 to 40 %. In the case of 100 % light crude oil, the study demonstrated Newtonian behavior. However, for emulsion with different volume water ratios, the rheological studies follow non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior and were described in better way by Ostwald de Waele and Herschel-Bulkley models. As a conclusion, rheological study shows that temperature, shear rate and volume water ratio have great impacts on the viscosity of water in oil emulsion and {{it is important to understand}} these factors to avoid various costly problems...|$|R

Here an effort was made to investigate the efficacy of gum odina as new pharmaceutical excipients, in particular, as an <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent.</b> Primary emulsion was prepared using wet gum method taking oil: water: gum (4 : 2 : 1) with gum acacia powder as an <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent.</b> This was used as a standard control formulation. In case of experimental emulsions the primary emulsion was prepared by same wet gum technique taking oil: water: gum (4 : 2 : 0. 5) (gum content was just a half of gum acacia) by using gum odina powder as an emulsifier. The gum odina as <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent</b> provided a stable emulsion at a very low concentration as compared to the amount required for other con- ventional natural <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents.</b> Stability studies of the emulsion were made as per the ICH guideline to study thermal stability, photo- sensitivity, pH related stability and stability in presence of oxygen. The emulsion type was identified by staining techniques (dye test by using Sudan III) as o/w type preparation without creaming or cracking even after long storage for 24 months at 25 Â°C. It was found that the emulsion containing gum odina produced more stable emulsion at a much lower amount as compared to the emulsion stabilized by gum acacia...|$|R

To verify the enzyme effects, three formulations were tested: Base formulation, characterized by the absence of enzyme and <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> (bread Zero); Control formulation, comprised by the presence of <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents</b> and ascorbic acid (bread Control), and the formulation prepared with the Base formulation and enzyme (bread MTGase). Protein fractions of gliadins, glutenin and waste extraction were obtained from samples of flour, dough and bread. The gliadins and glutenin were analyzed by RP-HPLC (reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography). The best formulation was obtained using a experimental design, with variations in the concentrations of <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agents,</b> ascorbic acid and enzyme. The results were evaluated by response surface methodology, which values are 0. 6 % of transglutaminase, 0. 2 % of <b>emulsifying</b> <b>agent</b> and 70 ppm of ascorbic acid. The analysis of gliadins fractions showed about 3 % protein, dry basis, and glutenins fractions were between 2 and 5 % protein. The results indicated that the enzyme modified chemical and functional properties of glutenins fraction, improving dough strength and bread volume. Results of total nitrogen content, and chromatographic profiles of the protein fractions suggest that while glutenins proteins were modified by enzyme, gliadins proteins were not affected...|$|R
