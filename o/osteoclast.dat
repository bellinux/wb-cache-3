40|$|Data in the {{literature}} suggest that site-specific differences exist in the skeleton with respect to digestion of bone by <b>osteoclasts.</b> Therefore, we investigated whether bone resorption by calvarial <b>osteoclasts</b> (intramembranous bone) differs from resorption by long bone <b>osteoclasts</b> (endochondral bone). The involvement of two major classes of proteolytic enzymes, the cysteine proteinases (CPs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), was studied by analyzing the effects of selective low molecular weight inhibitors of these enzymes on bone resorption. Mouse tissue explants (calvariae and long bones) as well as rabbit <b>osteoclasts,</b> which had been isolated from both skeletal sites and subsequently seeded on bone slices, were cultured {{in the presence of}} inhibitors and resorption was analyzed. The activity of the CP cathepsins B and K and of MMPs was determined biochemically (CPs and MMPs) and enzyme histochemically (CPs) in explants and isolated <b>osteoclasts.</b> We show that osteoclastic resorption of calvarial bone depends on activity of both CPs and MMPs, whereas long bone resorption depends on CPs, but not on the activity of MMPs. Furthermore, significantly higher levels of cathepsin B and cathepsin K activities were expressed by long bone <b>osteoclasts</b> than by calvarial <b>osteoclasts.</b> Resorption of slices of bovine skull or cortical bone by <b>osteoclasts</b> isolated from long bones was not affected by MMP inhibitors, whereas resorption by calvarial <b>osteoclasts</b> was inhibited. Inhibition of CP activity affected the resorption by the two populations of <b>osteoclasts</b> in a similar way. We conclude {{that this is the first}} report to show that significant differences exist between <b>osteoclasts</b> of calvariae and long bones with respect to their bone resorbing activities. Resorption by calvarial <b>osteoclasts</b> depends on the activity of CPs and MMPs, whereas resorption by long bone <b>osteoclasts</b> depends primarily on the activity of CPs.

40|$|AbstractThe {{fracture}} healing research, {{which has}} been performed in mammalian models not only for clinical application but also for bone metabolism, revealed that generally osteoblasts are induced to enter the fracture site before the induction of <b>osteoclasts</b> for bone remodeling. However, it remains unknown how and where <b>osteoclasts</b> and osteoblasts are induced, because {{it is difficult to}} observe <b>osteoclasts</b> and osteoblasts in a living animal. To answer these questions, we developed a new fracture healing model by using medaka. We fractured one side of lepidotrichia in a caudal fin ray without injuring the other soft tissues including blood vessels. Using the transgenic medaka in which <b>osteoclasts</b> and osteoblasts were visualized by GFP and DsRed, respectively, we found that two different types of functional <b>osteoclasts</b> were induced before and after osteoblast callus formation. The early-induced <b>osteoclasts</b> resorbed the bone fragments and the late-induced <b>osteoclasts</b> remodeled the callus. Both types of <b>osteoclasts</b> were induced near the surface on the blood vessels, while osteoblasts migrated from adjacent fin ray. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that no significant ruffled border and clear zone were observed in early-induced <b>osteoclasts,</b> whereas the late-induced <b>osteoclasts</b> had clear zones but did not have the typical ruffled border. In the remodeling of the callus, the expression of cox 2 mRNA was up-regulated at the fracture site around vessels, and the inhibition of Cox 2 impaired the induction of the late-induced <b>osteoclasts,</b> resulting in abnormal fracture healing.

This process is mediated by secretion of protons through the V-ATPase and chloride through the chloride antiporter ClC- 7. To {{shed light on}} the intracellular signalling controlling extracellular acidification, we screened a protein kinase inhibitor library in human <b>osteoclasts.</b> Methods Human <b>osteoclasts</b> were generated from CD 14 + monocytes. The effect of different kinase inhibitors on lysosomal acidification in human <b>osteoclasts</b> was investigated using acridine orange for different incubation times (45 minutes, 4 and 24 hours). The inhibitors were tested in an acid influx assay using microsomes isolated from human <b>osteoclasts.</b> Bone resorption by human <b>osteoclasts</b> on bone slices was measured by calcium release. Cell viability was measured using AlamarBlue. Results Of the 51 compounds investigated only few inhibitors were positive in both acidification and resorption assays. Rottlerin, GF 109203 X, Hypericin and Ro 31 - 8220 inhibited acid influx in microsomes and bone resorption, while Sphingosine and Palmitoyl-DL-carnitine-Cl showed low levels of inhibition. Rottlerin inhibited lysosomal acidification in human <b>osteoclasts</b> potently.

Two different organizations of actin have been described in <b>osteoclasts,</b> the podosomes belt corresponding to numerous F-actin columns arranged at the cell periphery, and the sealing zone defined as a unique large band of actin. To compare the role of these two different actin organizations, we imaged <b>osteoclasts</b> on various substrata: glass, dentin, and apatite. Using primary <b>osteoclasts</b> expressing GFP-actin, we found that podosome belts and sealing zones, both very dynamic actin structures, were present in mature osteoclasts; podosome belts were observed only in spread <b>osteoclasts</b> adhering onto glass, whereas sealing zone were seen in apico-basal polarized <b>osteoclasts</b> adherent on mineralized matrix. Dynamic observations of several resorption cycles of <b>osteoclasts</b> seeded on apatite revealed that 1) podosomes do not fuse together to form the sealing zone; 2) <b>osteoclasts</b> alternate successive stationary polarized resorption phases with a sealing zone and migration, nonresorption phases without any specific actin structure; and 3) apatite itself promotes sealing zone formation though c-src and Rho signaling.

40|$|Background: Bone {{remodeling}} {{relies on}} the tightly regulated interplay between bone forming osteoblasts and bone digesting <b>osteoclasts.</b> Several studies have now described the molecular mechanisms by which osteoblasts control osteoclastogenesis and bone degradation. It is currently unclear whether <b>osteoclasts</b> can influence bone rebuilding. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using in vitro cell systems, we show here that mature <b>osteoclasts,</b> but not their precursors, secrete chemotactic factors recognized by both mature osteoblasts and their precursors. Several growth factors whose expression is upregulated during osteoclastogenesis were identified by DNA microarrays as candidates mediating osteoblast chemotaxis. Our subsequent functional analyses demonstrate that mature <b>osteoclasts,</b> whose platelet-derived growth factor bb (PDGF-bb) expression is reduced by siRNAs, exhibit a reduced capability of attracting osteoblasts.

Therefore, this study was carried out to clarify how RA regulates the activity of <b>osteoclasts.</b> Using a pit assay involving unfractionated bone cells, including <b>osteoclasts</b> obtained from rabbits, we found that RA stimulated an increase in the bone-resorbing activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

Moreover, retinoic acid-receptor alpha mRNA and retinoid X-receptor beta mRNA were expressed in these mature <b>osteoclasts.</b> Our results indicate that <b>osteoclasts</b> are target cells for RA and that RA might regulate a part of bone formation and metabolism through <b>osteoclasts...</b>|$|R

At 3 h of incubation after LIPUS treatment, osteoclastic markers such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and cathepsin K mRNA expressions decreased significantly while mRNA expressions of osteoblastic markers, osteocalcin, distal-less homeobox 5, runt-related transcription factor 2 a, and runt-related transcription factor 2 b, increased significantly. At 6 and 18 h of incubation, however, both osteoclastic and osteoblastic marker mRNA expression did not change at least present conditions. Using GeneChip analysis of zebrafish scales treated with LIPUS, we found that cell death-related genes were upregulated with LIPUS treatment. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that the expression of apoptosis-related genes also increased significantly. To confirm the involvement of apoptosis in <b>osteoclasts</b> with LIPUS, <b>osteoclasts</b> were induced by autotransplanting scales in goldfish.

40|$|AbstractTooth {{replacement}} in polyphyodont is a well-organized {{system for}} maintenance of homeostasis of teeth, containing the dynamic structural change in skeletal tissues {{such as the}} attachment bone, which is the supporting element of teeth. Histological analyses have revealed the character of tooth replacement, however, the cellular mechanism of how skeletal tissues are modified during tooth replacement is largely unknown. Here, we showed {{the important role of}} osteoblasts for controlling <b>osteoclasts</b> to modify the attachment bone during tooth replacement in medaka pharyngeal teeth, coupled with an osterix-DsRed/TRAP-GFP transgenic line to visualize osteoblasts and <b>osteoclasts.</b> In the turnover of the row of attachment bones, these bones were resorbed at the posterior side where most developed functional teeth were located, and generated at the anterior side where teeth were newly erupted, which caused continuous tooth replacement. In the cellular analysis, <b>osteoclasts</b> and osteoblasts were located at attachment bones separately, since mature <b>osteoclasts</b> were localized at the resorbing side and osteoblasts gathered at the generating side. To demonstrate the role of <b>osteoclasts</b> in tooth replacement, we established medaka made deficient in c-fms-a by TALEN. c-fms-a deficient medaka showed hyperplasia of attachment bones along with reduced bone resorption accompanied by a low number of TRAP-positive <b>osteoclasts,</b> indicating an important role of <b>osteoclasts</b> in the turnover of attachment bones. Furthermore, nitroreductase-mediated osteoblast-specific ablation induced disappearance of <b>osteoclasts,</b> indicating that osteoblasts were essential for maintenance of <b>osteoclasts</b> for the proper turnover.

We have shown previously that <b>osteoclasts</b> contain gap-junctional protein connexin- 43 and that a commonly used gap-junctional inhibitor, heptanol, can inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption. Since heptanol may also have some unspecific effect unrelated to gap-junctional inhibition we wanted to test the importance of gap-junctional communication to <b>osteoclasts</b> using a more specific inhibitor. Methods A synthetic connexin-mimetic peptide, Gap 27, was used to evaluate the contribution of gap-junctional communication to osteoclastic bone resorption. We utilised the well-characterised pit-formation assay to study the effects of the specific gap-junctional inhibitor to the survival and activity of <b>osteoclasts.</b> Results Gap 27 caused a remarked {{decrease in the number of}} both TRAP-positive mononuclear and multinucleated rat <b>osteoclasts</b> cultured on bovine bone slices.

To determine if <b>osteoclasts</b> express NADPH-oxidase, a superoxide-generating enzyme found in phagocytic leukocytes, immunohistochemical studies were performed on tibia from 1 - 5 -d-old rats using mAbs 449 and 48 and an antiserum specific for p 47 -phox. These antibodies recognize epitopes on the alpha and beta subunits of cytochrome b 558, respectively, and the p 47 cytosolic component of NADPH-oxidase. We found that <b>osteoclasts</b> attached to bone surfaces in tibia expressed all three components, as did mature polymorphonuclear and some mononuclear leukocytes in the bone marrow. In many adherent <b>osteoclasts,</b> the cytochrome b 558 subunits were localized to the ruffled-border and bone interfaces.
