5|$|In 2000 and 2001, Flytoget {{experienced}} three derailments {{with empty}} trains at Gardermoen; one {{caused by the}} engineer falling asleep and two by the train passing a red light. No more such accidents <b>occurred</b> <b>after</b> Automatic Train Control was installed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} <b>occurred</b> <b>after</b> Spielmann, Hunt, and Lucas {{published a}} 2006 paper mentioning that the holotype of Redondasuchus {{was not a}} left paramedian but a right one. In 2002, Martz came {{to the same conclusion}} in an unpublished thesis. He, along with Taylor, Wedel, and Naish, claimed that this was another form of plagiarism.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of humans, an {{estimated}} 80% of the land was covered in forest, with only high alpine, wet, infertile and volcanic areas without trees. Massive deforestation <b>occurred</b> <b>after</b> humans arrived, with around half the forest cover lost to fire after Polynesian settlement. Much of the remaining forest fell after European settlement, being logged or cleared {{to make room for}} pastoral farming, leaving forest occupying only 23% of the land.|$|E
5|$|Brashear has two sons, Jordan and Jackson; he {{separated}} from their mother, Gabrielle Desgagne, his common-law wife, in 2007. In 2000, Brashear was charged with assault following an incident where he grabbed {{a man by the}} neck and shoved him. The incident <b>occurred</b> <b>after</b> the man complained to Desgagne about the couple's infant son crawling on the exercise machines in a communal gym. Brashear received six months probation after pleading guilty to common assault.|$|E

In his first {{legislative}} campaign, Rice was criticized for his association with Dismas House founder Bob Sylvester, who was found guilty in 2000 of sexually abusing inmates. The incidents for which Sylvester was tried <b>occurred</b> <b>after</b> Rice left his employment at Dismas, and Rice testified {{on behalf of the}} prosecution during Sylvester's trial.|$|E

One of their children claimed that the separation <b>occurred</b> <b>after</b> an incident in which Hensley became drunk and fought a neighbor. Amanda left the area and found work in a Chattanooga hosiery mill but soon became ill and bedridden. Hensley's sister and brother-in-law traveled to Chattanooga to care for her.|$|E
5|$|His {{death is}} now {{believed}} to have <b>occurred</b> <b>after</b> the first American combat fatalities in the Battle of Osan. Since the identities of other soldiers killed before Shadrick remain unknown, he is still often incorrectly cited as the first U.S. soldier killed in the war.|$|E
5|$|However, this winding route {{proved to}} be too {{dangerous}} and difficult for the explosion of vehicle traffic that <b>occurred</b> <b>after</b> World War II. Alvinston was originally reliant on the Canada Southern Railroad, which {{was taken over by}} the Michigan Central Railway and that by New York Central. However, by 1960 the use of the rails had declined so much that service was stopped. The tracks were lifted two years later.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{facets of}} Minnesota culture that are {{perceived}} as the area's early history in fact originated after this period. Notably, the heavy Scandinavian immigration for which the state is known, and the pioneering days chronicled by author Laura Ingalls Wilder <b>occurred</b> <b>after</b> statehood in the later 19th century. Unlike these later years, {{the first half of}} the 19th century was characterized by sparsely populated communities, harsh living conditions, and to some degree, lawlessness.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad's life is {{traditionally}} defined into two periods: pre-hijra (emigration) in Mecca (from 570 to 622), and post-hijra in Medina (from 622 until 632).

5|$|The First Partition <b>occurred</b> <b>after</b> {{the balance}} of power in Europe shifted, with Russian {{victories}} against the Ottomans in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) strengthening Russia and endangering Habsburg interests in that region (particularly in Moldavia and Wallachia).
