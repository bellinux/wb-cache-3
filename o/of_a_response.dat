This was seen to be in response to the dubia (Latin for doubts) submitted by him, together with three other cardinals, to elements of Amoris laetitia which appear to them to be at odds with Catholic moral teaching, notably with regard to the treatment of divorced persons. Burke had indicated that in the absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to the dubia a “formal correction” of Pope Francis would probably follow.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{contributing}} to an effective or declining public {{health care system}} and water sanitation treatments, government can have indirect effects on cholera control and the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to cholera. A country's government can impact its ability to prevent disease and control its spread. A speedy government response backed by a fully functioning health care system and financial resources can prevent cholera's spread. This limits cholera's ability to cause death, {{or at the very}} least a decline in education, as children are kept out of school to minimize the risk of infection.|$|E
25|$|UDP {{scanning}} is also possible, {{although there}} are technical challenges. UDP is a connectionless protocol {{so there is no}} equivalent to a TCP SYN packet. However, if a UDP packet is sent to a port that is not open, the system will respond with an ICMP port unreachable message. Most UDP port scanners use this scanning method, and use the absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to infer that a port is open. However, if a port is blocked by a firewall, this method will falsely report that the port is open. If the port unreachable message is blocked, all ports will appear open. This method is also affected by ICMP rate limiting.|$|E

When planned, the attack had the approval of the Haganah, the principal Jewish paramilitary group in Palestine, though, unbeknownst to the Irgun, this had been cancelled by the time the operation was carried out. It was conceived as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to Operation Agatha (a series of widespread raids, including one on the Jewish Agency, conducted by the British authorities) and was the deadliest directed at the British during the Mandate era (1920–1948).|$|E

25|$|In free-operant {{avoidance}} {{a subject}} periodically receives an aversive stimulus (often an electric shock) unless an operant response is made; the response delays {{the onset of}} the shock. In this situation, unlike discriminated avoidance, no prior stimulus signals the shock. Two crucial time intervals determine the rate of avoidance learning. This first is the S-S (shock-shock) interval. This is time between successive shocks in the absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>response.</b> The second interval is the R-S (response-shock) interval. This specifies the time by which an operant response delays {{the onset of the}} next shock. Note that each time the subject performs the operant response, the R-S interval without shock begins anew.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} was aimed at (a) {{investigating}} the effect of three doses methylphenidate (MPH) and placebo on inhibition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prepotent <b>response,</b> inhibition <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ongoing <b>response,</b> and interfer-ence control in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD), and (b) studying dose-response relations for the three forms of response inhibition. To meet these aims, the following tasks were selected: {{two versions of the}} Stop Paradigm for inhibition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prepotent <b>response,</b> <b>a</b> Circle Tracing Task and a recently developed Follow Task for inhibition <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ongoing <b>response,</b> and the Stroop Color-Word Test and an Eriksen Flanker Task for interference control. These tasks were adminis-tered to 23 boys with AD/HD during four treatment conditions: 5 mg MPH, 10 mg MPH, 20 mg MPH, and placebo. A pseudorandomized, multiple-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject design was used. As hypothesized, inhibitory control in children with AD/HD improved under MPH com-pared to placebo. However, this effect was only significant for inhibition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prepotent <b>response</b> and inhibition <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ongoing <b>response</b> (as measured by the Follow Task), but not for interference control. The relation between treatment condition and response was linear. However, this linear relation was due to improved inhibitory control under MPH compared to placebo, because no effects of MPH dose were observed for any of the response inhibition measures.

25|$|On January 6, 1773, black petitioners {{submitted}} {{the first of}} five appeals written during the year, asking {{for a range of}} rights, to Governor Hutchinson and the General Court of Massachusetts. Though signed only by a slave named Felix, the document petitioned for the freedom and rights of all slaves in the Massachusetts colony. While the tone of the petition is cautious, it speaks to the “unhappy State and Condition” in which enslaved persons are forced to live. Abolitionists later published the petition as a pamphlet, along with letters and other abolitionist documents. Felix’s petition expressed the talk of freedom, liberty, {{and the pursuit of happiness}} that was circulating around Massachusetts and other American colonies before the American Revolution. No record <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> from the Massachusetts General Court exists. Although slavery was never explicitly abolished or prohibited in the new Massachusetts Constitution after the Revolutionary War, rulings in freedom suits by Mum Bett and Quock Walker established that its representation of rights was incompatible with slavery, and remaining slaves effectively gained their freedom.|$|E
25|$|The Socialist Party of Great Britain {{was founded}} in 1904 as a split from the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). It was formed to oppose the SDF’s reformism and as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to that organisation's {{domination}} by H. M. Hyndman (which also led to the SPGB's aversion to leadership). This split was also partly {{a reaction to the}} SDF's involvement in the Labour Representation Committee which went on to found the Labour Party. It mirrored the split that led to the foundation of the Socialist League, stemming from an ongoing dispute within the socialist movement over tactics and the question of reform or revolution. The founders of the SPGB considered themselves {{to be part of a}} wider impossibilist revolt within the Second International. When in 1903 most of SDF members in Scotland broke away to form the Socialist Labour Party, without contacting their fellow impossibilists in London those impossibilists, chiefly in Battersea branch, decided to break away and form their own organisation, which they did the following year. Unlike the Socialist League, however, the SPGB advocated the revolutionary use of the ballot box and parliament.|$|E

The song was eventually spawned as a single and was considered controversial for its storyline, which described a woman who contracts AIDS from a one-night stand.
