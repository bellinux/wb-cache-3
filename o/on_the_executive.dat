5|$|After meeting Fannie Lou Hamer in {{the summer}} of 1964 and hearing her {{experiences}} in the civil rights movement, Blackwell decided to join the SNCC.

In late August she and 67 other activists left Mississippi to represent the MFDP at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in an attempt to get the MFDP seated as delegates. They were unsuccessful in getting seats, but the move brought the party and the Mississippi civil rights movement into the public eye.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental rights {{primarily}} protect {{individuals from}} any arbitrary state actions, but some rights are enforceable against individuals. For instance, the Constitution abolishes untouchability and also prohibits begar. These provisions {{act as a}} check both on state action {{as well as the}} action of private individuals. However, these rights are not absolute or uncontrolled and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of general welfare. They can also be selectively curtailed. The Supreme Court has ruled that all provisions of the Constitution, including fundamental rights can be amended. However, the Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution. Since the fundamental rights can be altered only by a constitutional amendment, their inclusion is a check not only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> branch but also on the Parliament and state legislatures.|$|E

5|$|William Hespeler was {{appointed}} to serve <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Executive</b> Council as a cabinet minister serving Lieutenant Governor Morris.

The Council chose William Osborne Smith to chair the proceedings of the Council as well as the Board of Health.|$|E
5|$|As the 1931 gubernatorial {{election}} approached, Chandler and Prestonsburg native Jack Howard {{were mentioned}} as candidates for lieutenant governor. Congressman Fred M. Vinson backed Howard, a fellow Eastern Kentuckian, while political bosses Billy Klair, Johnson N. Camden, Jr., and Ben Johnson supported Chandler. The support of another political boss, Mickey Brennan, gave Chandler the edge at the party's nominating convention. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Ruby Laffoon also owed his selection to the machinations of the state's political bosses, notably his uncle, Congressman Polk Laffoon. Problematically, Chandler was {{an ally of}} former Governor J. C. W. Beckham, Louisville Courier-Journal publisher Robert Worth Bingham, and political boss Percy Haly, which put him at odds with Laffoon, {{a member of a}} Democratic faction headed by Russellville political boss Thomas Rhea and opposed to Beckham, Worth, and Haly. Despite disharmony within the ticket, the worsening of the Great Depression under Republican President Herbert Hoover and Governor Sampson ensured a Democratic victory. Chandler was elected over John C. Worsham by a vote of 426,247 to 353,573. In a break with precedent, Chandler set up an office <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> floor of the state capitol and worked there full-time; previous lieutenant governors had stayed in Frankfort only during legislative sessions, when they were charged with presiding over the state senate.|$|E
