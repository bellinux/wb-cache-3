500|$|The {{film has}} come to be seen as the archetypal {{portrayal}} of 1980s excess, with Douglas advocating [...] "greed, for lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> is good". Wall Street defines itself through a number of morality conflicts putting wealth and power against simplicity and honesty, and an attack on the value system of extreme competitiveness where ethics and the law are simply irrelevant parts of the show.|$|E
500|$|Wall Street (1987) – The notorious [...] "corporate raider" [...] and [...] "greenmailer" [...] Gordon Gekko, {{representing}} {{a synthesis of}} the worst features of various famous private equity figures, intends to manipulate an ambitious young stockbroker {{to take over a}} failing but decent airline. [...] Although Gekko makes a pretense of caring about the airline, his intentions prove to be to destroy the airline, strip its assets and lay off its employees before raiding the corporate pension fund. [...] Gekko would become a symbol in popular culture for unrestrained greed (with the signature line, [...] "Greed, for lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> is good") that would be attached to the private equity industry.|$|E
40|$|The idea {{described}} in {{this paper is to}} improve searches on the Internet by using the syntactic structure of sentences. We implemented a method which with help of context factors is able to capture the importance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>better</b> than <b>a</b> simple occurrence count. The prototype developed is slow and with the functionality limited to simple cases. Further suggestions of improvement of the method are given...|$|R
5000|$|English {{translations}} of the ceremonial shi 尸 include personator, impersonator, representative, medium, and shaman. Carr reviews the choices.Obviously, rendering this into English is problematic {{because there is}} no Western analogy for the ceremonial shi 'corpse.' Personator is chosen as the nearest English translation. Impersonator would be possible, but this word implies falsehood, which was not originally associated with the shi. Representative is too general in meaning, and does not usually have <b>a</b> sense <b>of</b> spirituality, unless modified by of the dead/ancestor. Paper 1995 suggests Incorporator of the Dead, which has a parallel 'one who embodies' etymology, but the derivate words incorporate and incorporation commonly have other meanings. Medium and shaman are similar with shi in meaning and are part of Chinese traditions; however, the descriptions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dignified personator are unlike the spirit-possession of either. Another translational tactic would be to coin a nonce word, such as Waley's 1937 [...] "the Dead One," [...] Eberhard's 1968 [...] "death boy," [...] or Wilhelm's 1967 [...] "corpse boy," [...] but the sense <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> coinage is not always clear. Therefore, in the absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> English <b>word,</b> personator will translate this meaning of shi. (2007:364-365) ...|$|R
6000|$|... [1] The {{authority}} of Milton and Shakespeare may be usefully {{pointed out to}} young authors. In the Comus and other early poems of Milton there is <b>a</b> superfluity <b>of</b> double epithets; while in the Paradise Lost we find very few, in the Paradise Regained scarce any. The same remark holds almost equally true of the Love's Labour Lost, Romeo and Juliet, Venus and Adonis, and Lucrece, compared with the Lear, Macbeth, Othello, and Hamlet of our great Dramatist. The rule for the admission of double epithets seems to be this: either {{that they should be}} already denizens of our language, such as blood-stained, terror- stricken, self-applauding: or when a new epithet, or one found in books only, is hazarded, that it, at least, be one word, not two words made one by mere virtue of the printers hyphen. A language which, like the English, is almost without cases, is indeed in its very genius unfitted for compounds. If a writer, every time a compounded word suggests itself to him, would seek for some other mode of expressing the same sense, the chances are always greatly in favour <b>of</b> his finding <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word.</b> Ut tanquam scopulum sic fugias insolens verbum, is the wise advice of Caesar to the Roman Orators, and the precept applies with double force to the writers in our own language. But it must not be forgotten, that the same Caesar wrote a Treatise for the purpose of reforming the ordinary language by bringing it to a greater accordance with the principles of logic or universal grammar.|$|R
500|$|The Bears {{failed to}} score 18 {{points for the}} first time in 2013, while {{allowing}} a season-high five sacks. Chicago also allowed two 100-yard rushers in the same game {{for the first time}} since 1976 against the Denver Broncos, with Norris Weese (120 yards) and Ottis Anderson (116 yards) guiding the Broncos to 28–14 win. After the game, Marc Trestman stated, [...] "We are a team that was ready to play this game and we played a terrible football game for lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word.</b> I'm not going to use any word other than that. We were terrible in all three phases. We didn't play well in any phase of football." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite her {{physical}} {{absence from the}} entry, Cher's presence can be felt throughout the narrative. Negra argues that Cher's [...] "flamboyant and self-authored body" [...] {{is used as a}} metaphor for [...] "the possibility of self-transformation". In addition, her voice, heard via songs like [...] "Walking in Memphis", is associated with the idea of [...] "circumvent patriarchy." [...] Negra notes that Cher's music is used in scenes during The Great Mutato's sexual encounters with women. Negra asserts that [...] "this juxtaposition of sound and image cues our perception that we have entered the realm of carnival where the normal order of things is inverted." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club reasons that the ending was not the actual conclusion of the episode, but rather the fanciful and elaborate happy ending that was concocted by Izzy Berkowitz, the writer of the comic book, after talking to Mulder. In this manner, VanDerWeff notes, [...] "the episode abandons logic and reality and, for lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> transcends." [...] Meghan Deans from Tor.com postulates that the entire episode never happened [...] "rom a canonical perspective" [...] due to the entry's comic book setting, the various meta-references and the [...] "happy ending".|$|E
500|$|From {{conception}} {{to final}} release in 2009, drummer Aaron Harris {{estimates that the}} creation and execution of Wavering Radiant took {{about two and a}} half years. During the writing of the record, all of Isis' members were residing permanently within Los Angeles; a situation in contrast to their previous full-length, 2006's In the Absence of Truth; band members were divided between New York and Los Angeles throughout that album's inception and creation. The entire band felt a degree of dissatisfaction with In the Absence of Truth, and Harris felt that the logistical change was beneficial to the writing process, allowing for more time: [...] "rather than feeling like we had limited time to capture something, I felt like we could take our time with the songs, and come back the next day to work on things rather than in a few weeks". The resulting sound was described by guitarist Michael Gallagher as [...] "more live [...] a little bit dirtier – almost, for lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>word,</b> sloppy. But in a good way. We spent a lot of time getting all of our takes as close to perfect as we could on previous records. On this one, we went more with the vibe of the particular take in question." ...|$|E

Para comprobar la adquisición, en cinco meses, de una mejor decodificación de sílabas y palabras, mediante el dominio de las reglas de correspondencia grafema-fonema, se aplicaron, en febrero y junio de 2010, subpruebas de cuatro test de lectura: LEA, P. E. R. E. L, PROLEC y LEE. Los análisis evidencian que se obtuvo, no sólo una mejor decodificación por parte de los estudiantes del grupo experimental, sino también un mejor desempeño en la segmentación fonética y una mayor generalización hacia nuevas combinaciones silábicas, por lo que se concluye que las estrategias pictofónicas son eficaces para la enseñanza de la lectura.

But [...] {{that there is nothing}} ordinary about the music." [...] Sondheim and Furth have revised the show since its original production, and Sondheim later said: [...] "Did I feel betrayed?

40|$|Pētījums ir veltīts morālā kaitējuma institūta izpratnei Latvijas civiltiesībās. Tā kā CL 1635. pants uzskatāms par morālā kaitējuma institūta civiltiesībās pamatu, bakalaura darbā veikta šā panta (izņemot otrās daļas otro teikumu) interpretācija jeb iztulkošana, izmantojot gramatisko, sistēmisko, vēsturisko un teleoloģisko metodi. Pētījuma pirmajā daļā apskatīta morālā kaitējuma institūta attīstības gaita un piemērošanas problēmas Latvijā, salīdzinot tās ar situāciju Rietumvalstīs, kā arī bijušajā Padomju Savienībā. Otrajā daļā veikta CL 1635. panta gramatiskā iztulkošana. Trešajā daļā CL 1635. pants interpretēts sistēmiski, bet ceturtajā daļā – vēsturiski un teleoloģiski. Veikusi CL 1635. panta gramatisko, sistēmisko, vēsturisko un teleoloģisko interpretāciju, autore atzīst, ka tā taisnīgai piemērošanai nepieciešams izmantot tiesību tālākveidošanu contra legem. Ar šīs juridiskās metodes palīdzību tālākveidotais CL 1635. pants konkretizē, nevis ierobežo Satversmes 92. panta trešajā teikumā un citos pantos garantētās tiesības. Diemžēl nav iespējams prognozēt, vai šādu diezgan sarežģītu tiesību piemērošanu atzīs Latvijas tiesas, tādēļ darba nobeigumā autore piedāvā labāku CL 1635. panta regulējumu. The {{investigation}} {{is dedicated to}} understanding {{of the concept of}} moral injury within the civil law of Latvia in relation to the respective concept of the right to compensation for moral injury. In order to come to certain conclusions Article No 1635 (except the second sentence of Paragraph 2) of the Civil Law of the Republic of Latvia has been interpreted thoroughly. In {{the first part of the}} research the author deals with the course of development and application problems of the concept of moral injury in Latvia, making comparison with their status in western countries as well as in the former Soviet Union. In the second part the grammatical interpretation of Article No 1635 has been realized. In the third part Article No 1635 has been interpreted systemically, but in the fourth part – historically and teleologically. Having interpreted No 1635 of the Civil Law of the Republic of Latvia by making use of grammatical, systemic, historical and teleological methods, the author acknowledges that in order to ensure the equitable application of this norm, it is necessary to use the method of further law-making «contra legem». If Article No 1635 has been developed by the help of the method «contra legem», the norm specifies but not restricts the respective human rights granted by the third sentence of Article No 92 of the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia as well as by other normative acts in force. Unfortunately it is impossible to envisage whether the courts of Latvia would approve of this rather complicated application of rights, therefore within the conclusion of the research work, the author proposes her idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> regulation and <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the norm...|$|R
