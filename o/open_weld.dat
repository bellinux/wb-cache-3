50|$|There {{are many}} types of butt welds, but all fall within one of these categories: single welded butt joints, double welded butt joint, and open or closed butt joints. A single welded butt joint is the name for a joint that has only been welded from one side. A double welded butt joint is created when the weld has been welded from both sides. With double welding, the depths of each weld can vary slightly. A closed weld {{is a type of}} joint in which the two pieces that will be joined are {{touching}} during the welding process. An <b>open</b> <b>weld</b> is the joint type where the two pieces have a small gap in between them during the welding process.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{avoid the}} open {{problems}} of the leading wheel and get a more rational structure, the paper uses PRO / E and the finite element software to analyze the leading wheel of JKM- 3. 25 / 4 multi-rope friction hoist. The results show that in the leading wheel the rib plates between the channel steel and wheel hub are removed or added the same ones will have {{little effect on the}} overall force situation, and only affect the stress of the weld bead. To solve the problem of <b>open</b> <b>weld</b> of rib plates, can consider the rib plates to be removed. When the radial angle between support wheel and drum is bigger than 6 °, the overall force of the leading wheel is affected seriously. But when the radial angle is 5 °, the amplitude of stress fluctuation is the minimum, which can improve the leading wheel working conditions and increase the service life of the leading wheel. Therefore the suggestion is to take the radial angle of 5 ° when to design the new multi-rope hoist. Study conclusions provide the theoretical supports for the leading wheel of multi-rope friction design and technical renovation...|$|E

In the Wrst experiment, fear acquisition (four tone-shock pairings in operant chamber) was followed by extinction training (60 tones in <b>open</b> <b>Weld).</b> Congenitally helpless rats showed fear acquisition similar to controls but had dramatic extinction deWcits, and did not display the gradual extinction curves observed in con-trols. Congenitally helpless rats demonstrated greater tone-evoked freezing as compared to controls in both the acquisition and extinction contexts one week after extinction training, {{and also in the}} extinction probe conducted one month later. In the second experiment (which began one month after the Wrst experiment) congenitally helpless subjects were further exposed to tones for 5 days, each followed by 4 mg/kg methylene blue or saline IP, and had a fear renewal test in the acquisition context. Methylene blue administration improved retention of the extinction memory as demonstrated by signiWcant decreases in fear renewal as compared to saline-administered congenitally helpless subjects. The impaired ability to extinguish fear to a traumatic memory in congenitally helpless rats supports the validity of this strain as an animal model for vulnerability to post-traumatic stress disorder, and this study further suggests that methylene blue may facilitate fear extinction as an adjunct to exposure therapy...|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{precision}} of orbital TIG welding, even the smallest standard tube diameters from 1.6 millimetres can be processed. On a larger scale, pipes with diameters up to 170mm and walls up to 3.5mm thick can be joined using closed chamber weld heads. These weld heads allow the torch to be positioned very precisely and ensure that the pipe is held securely. The inert gas atmosphere in the closed chamber prevents heat from tinting, even with the most sensitive of materials. For tube diameters between 8 and 275mm, {{it is possible to}} use more manageable <b>open</b> <b>welding</b> heads (except for high purity applications). A flexible hose system is used to supply the welding head with power, inert gas, cooling water and filler wire where required. The need for filler wire during the welding process depends on the type of welding task; thicker tube walls and difficult-to-control parent materials require the use of additional material, whereas thin-walled tubes can be welded without extra wire.In order to create high quality weld seams it is essential that tube ends are carefully prepared with the edges of the workpieces being free of scale and impurities. For thinner-walled tubes up to medium diameters, a simple right-angled saw cut is often sufficient. For thicker tube walls it is necessary to prepare the edges more carefully, for example using a U-groove cross-section.|$|R

40|$|Nd:YAG laser joining is a {{high energy}} density (HED) process that can produce high-speed, low-heat input welds with a high depth-to-width aspect ratio. This is {{optimized}} by formation of a ''keyhole'' in the weld pool resulting from high vapor pressures associated with laser interaction with the metallic substrate. It is generally accepted that pores form in HED welds due to the instability and frequent collapse of the keyhole. In order to maintain an <b>open</b> keyhole, <b>weld</b> pool forces must be balanced such that vapor pressure and weld pool inertia forces are in equilibrium. Travel speed and laser beam power largely control the way these forces are balanced, as well as welding mode (Continuous Wave or Square Wave) and shielding gas type.

5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most <b>open</b> arc <b>welding</b> processes, a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|R
