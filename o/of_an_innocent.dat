It was given at the Opéra-Comique in November 1897, with great success, though it has been neglected since the composer's death. His next work staged there was Cendrillon, his version of the Cinderella story, which was well received in May 1899.|$|E

25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of innocence is only rejected when an error is very unlikely, because one doesn't want to convict an innocent defendant. Such an error is called error {{of the first}} kind (i.e., the conviction <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>innocent</b> person), and the occurrence of this error is controlled to be rare. As a consequence of this asymmetric behaviour, an error of the second kind (acquitting a person who committed the crime), is more common.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in the novel, the titular Labours are not {{undertaken}} by Poirot as cases, but rather {{refer to a}} series of paintings that are stolen by Marrascaud, the main villain; the title is also symbolic of Poirot's path to redemption after his plan to snare Marrascaud leads to the senseless murder <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>innocent</b> girl, Lucinda LeMesurier. The most significant departure from the source material is the change in Marrascaud's identity; in the book it is Gustave who is Marrascaud, but in the adaptation it is Alice Cunningham, with Gustave being her accomplice (along with Dr Lutz).|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 1683, Antonio Benavides, marques de San Vicente disembarked at Veracruz. Better known {{subsequently}} as the impostor El Tapado, {{he claimed}} to be visitador general (royal inspector) and governor of New Spain appointed by Queen Regent Mariana of Austria. He was arrested at Cuetlaxcoapa (Puebla), accused {{of being one of}} Lorencillo's pirates. From there he was taken to Mexico City in chains. On 12 July 1684 he was conducted to the scaffold, but when he appeared there was an eclipse of the sun. Although the people viewed this as Heaven's displeasure at the execution <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>innocent,</b> he was executed anyway.|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that requiring juries {{to reach a}} unanimous verdict reduces the probability <b>of</b> convicting <b>an</b> <b>innocent</b> defendant while increasing the probability <b>of</b> acquitting <b>a</b> guilty defendant. We construct a model that demonstrates how strategic voting by jurors undermines this basic intuition. We show that unanimity rule may lead to high probabilities of both kinds of errors and that the probability <b>of</b> convicting <b>an</b> <b>innocent</b> may actually increase {{with the size of}} the jury. Finally, we demonstrate that <b>a</b> wide variety <b>of</b> voting rules, including simple majority rule, lead to much lower probabilities of both kinds of errors...|$|R

25|$|Screenwriter Robert Rodat wrote {{seventeen}} {{drafts of}} the script before there was an acceptable one. In an early version, Anne is pregnant with Gabriel's child when she dies in the burning church. Rodat wrote the script with Gibson in mind for Benjamin Martin, and gave the Martin character six children to signal this preference to studio executives. After the birth of Gibson's seventh child, the script was changed so that Martin had seven children. Like the character William Wallace, which Gibson portrayed in Braveheart five years earlier, Martin is a man seeking to live his life in peace until revenge drives him to lead a cause against a national enemy after the life <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>innocent</b> family member is taken.|$|E
25|$|Designed to {{meet the}} {{training}} requirements of a company-sized unit in an urban environment, Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) Site Calero includes 48 buildings constructed from connex containers up to two stories high, {{with a mixture of}} rubble and complete structures.

25|$|The defense {{strategy}} was to impeach {{the testimony of the}} key prosecution witnesses: Lloyd and Weichmann. It also wished to show that she was loyal to the Union, her trips to Surrattsville were <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>innocent</b> nature, and she had not been aware of Booth's plans. There were 31 witnesses who testified for the defense. George H. Calvert testified that he had pressed Surratt to pay a debt, Bennett Gwynn said Surratt had sought payment from John Nothey to satisfy the Calvert debt, and Nothey agreed that he had received a letter from Surratt for him to appear at the tavern on April 11 to pay what was owed. Several witnesses impugned Lloyd's character by testifying about his alcoholism. Several eyewitnesses said he appeared completely intoxicated on the day of Lincoln's death (April 14) and implied that he could not have remembered that day clearly. (However, Lloyd had testified that he repaired a broken spring on Surratt's wagon, which rebutted the claims.) Augustus Howell, a Confederate agent, testified that Surratt's eyesight was poor and that Weichmann was an untrustworthy witness, as he had sought to become a Confederate spy himself. (The prosecution had attempted to show that Howell was a Confederate spy and should not be trusted.) Anna Surratt testified that it was Weichmann who had brought Atzerodt into the boarding house, that the photograph of Booth was hers (given to her by her father in 1862), and that she owned photographs of Union political and military leaders. Anna denied ever overhearing any discussions of disloyal activities or ideas in the boarding house, and she said that while Booth visited the house many times, his stays were always short. Anna explained her mother's failure to recognize Powell by asserting she could not see well. Honora Fitzpatrick was called back to the stand and testified to Mary's poor eysight as well. A former servant and a former slave both said her eyesight was failing and that she had given Union soldiers food. Numerous witnesses were called {{at the end of the}} defense's case to testify to her loyalty to the Union, her deep Christian faith, and her kindness. A number of Catholic priests were called to the stand to testify about Surratt's faith, good character, and incorruptibility. Portraying Surratt as a good Christian woman incapable of committing the crimes for which she was accused was a large part of the {{defense strategy}}. During the prosecution's rebuttal, government lawyers called four witnesses (P.T. Ransford, John Ryan, Frank Stith, and James Young) to the stand, who testified as to Weichmann's unimpeachable character.|$|E

500|$|Closing {{arguments}} {{were made on}} January 23. Selden argued that Colt had acted in self-defense as Adams had been choking him and Colt's only means to defend himself was to grab a nearby weapon. [...] His defense for hiding the body was temporary insanity. [...] Whiting countered in a two-hour-long rebuttal that the killing was premeditated; he pointed to Colt's demeanor at the trial, the taking of Adams' watch, the leaving of a hatchet in plain view, and Colt's method of disposing of the body as evidence contradicting Colt's claim that his actions were that <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>innocent</b> man acting in self-defense. [...] Judge Kent dismissed the argument for self-defense based on Colt's attempted cover-up and instructed the jury that since Colt had confessed to the murder {{that they were to}} determine whether the charge should be murder or manslaughter. [...] Kent remarked on Colt's [...] "careless air" [...] demonstrated throughout the trial in the courtroom and said his behavior was [...] "not typical <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>innocent</b> man". [...] The jury was disturbed by Colt's demeanor throughout the trial, agreeing with the judge that Colt appeared stoic, unremorseful and callous when describing his disposal of Adams' body. [...] On January 24, after deliberating for over 10 hours, the jury found Colt guilty of willful murder.|$|E

[...] Direct and intentional killing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>innocent</b> human is considered a mortal sin.

[...] John Chalmers Vinson, in his volume on Borah's involvement with the war outlawry movement, believed that the senator [...] "spoke for {{a large part of}} the American public. He was the archetype of absolute insistence on unfettered national will that has been loosely described as isolationism. Further, he represented the struggle to preserve in full the traditions of a small republic remote from strong neighbors against the inroads of recurring crises faced by a world power." [...] According to LeRoy Ashby in his book on Borah, he [...] "emerged as one of the major figures in American reform politics [...] reached the peak of his prestige and influence during the Twenties". Maddox noted that [...] "almost as suspicious of U.S. presidents as he was of foreign nations, Borah perceived threats everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{requirement}} that the action be dangerous was confirmed in R v Newbury, which applied the previous reasoning on R v Church: [...] "the unlawful act must be such that all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise it as an act which must subject the other person to at least the risk of some harm resulting therefrom albeit not serious harm". This is an (almost completely) objective test, it disregards whether the defendant in particular foresaw the danger, and requires only that it would create a risk of some harm. The ordinary person knows only what the defendant did, at least {{in relation to the}} susceptibility of the victim. R v Ball did, however, create a class of dangerous [...] that of the act itself [...] where the jury knew more than the defendant; in this case, whilst the defendant knew he was loading a blank cartridge, the jury was entitled to ascribe knowledge that it might be a live cartridge to the reasonable man. This has been criticised, and may not have been necessary. The act need not be directed at the victim: the killing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>innocent</b> bystander by mistake could be manslaughter.|$|E

Said the filing: [...] "Rolling Stone and Erdely's highly defamatory and false statements about Dean Eramo were not the result <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>innocent</b> mistake. They {{were the result of}} a wanton journalist who was more concerned with writing an article that fulfilled her preconceived narrative about the victimization of women on American college campuses, and a malicious publisher who was more concerned about selling magazines to boost the economic bottom line for its faltering magazine, than they were about discovering the truth or actual facts." [...] In February 2016, the judge in the lawsuit ordered Jackie to appear at a deposition on April 5, 2016. On March 30, 2016, The Washington Post reported that Jackie's lawyers have requested the April deposition be cancelled, to avoid having her [...] "revisit her sexual assault". However, on April 2, 2016, the judge denied the motions and ordered Jackie to appear for a deposition on April 6, to be held at a secret location. [...] On November 4, 2016, after 20 hours of deliberation, a jury consisting of eight women and two men found Rolling Stone, the magazine's publisher and Erdely liable for defaming Eramo.
