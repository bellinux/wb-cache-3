5|$|Encouraged by {{her mother}} and sister, Murray decided to enroll at the newly opened {{department}} of Egyptology at University College London (UCL) in Bloomsbury, Central London. Having been founded by an endowment from Amelia Blanford Edwards, one of the co-founders of the Egypt Exploration Fund (EEF), the department was run by the pioneering early archaeologist Sir William Flinders Petrie, and based in the Edwards Library of UCL's South Cloisters. Murray began her studies at UCL at age 30 in January 1894, {{as part of a}} class composed largely <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>women</b> and older men. There, she took courses in the Ancient Egyptian and Coptic languages which were taught by Francis Llewellyn Griffith and Walter Ewing Crum respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{acting on}} these {{feelings}} and perceptions, Stanton joined Mott, Mott's sister Martha Coffin Wright, Jane Hunt {{and a handful}} <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>women</b> in Seneca Falls. Together they organized the Seneca Falls Convention held in Seneca Falls on July 19 and 20. Over 300 people attended. Stanton drafted a Declaration of Sentiments, which she read at the convention. Modeled on the United States Declaration of Independence, Stanton's declaration proclaimed {{that men and women}} are created equal. She proposed, among other things, a then-controversial resolution demanding voting rights for women. The final resolutions, including female suffrage, were passed, in no small measure, because of the support of Frederick Douglass, who attended and informally spoke at the convention.|$|E
5|$|The Dirty Picture is a 2011 Indian biographical musical drama film {{inspired}} by the life of Silk Smitha, a South Indian actress noted for her erotic roles. The filmmakers have clarified that the story is not officially or literally based on Smitha alone, but on many of her southern contemporaries such as Disco Shanti. It also resembles the personal lives <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>women</b> in popular culture, including Hollywood actress and sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. The film was directed by Milan Luthria and co-produced by Shobha Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor, after Ekta {{came up with the}} idea and asked screenwriter Rajat Aroraa to pen a story based on it.|$|E

5|$|Cadron-Jetté {{was born}} and raised in Lavaltrie, Quebec, and in 1811 married Jean-Marie Jetté. They had 11 children, several of whom died young. In 1827 she moved to Montreal and in 1832 her husband died of cholera. From 1840, in {{collaboration}} with Ignace Bourget (then Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Montreal), she engaged in the charitable care of unwed mothers. At this time in Montreal, unwed mothers and those associating with them attracted a significant social stigma. Cadron-Jetté operated initially out of her own home and the homes of her children, and later, with the aid <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>women,</b> worked from a series of buildings known as the Hospice de Sainte-Pélagie. In 1848, she took religious vows, along with several other women, and founded a Roman Catholic religious institute known as the Sisters of Misericorde, dedicated to the care of unwed mothers and their children. In 1849 she obtained formal midwifery qualifications. In 1853 the Misericorde Sisters built a convent on the corner of Dorchester Boulevard and Saint-André Street, and she lived there the remainder of her life.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} 1800–1814 (when Walter Scott's Waverley was published) Edgeworth {{was the most}} celebrated and {{successful}} living English novelist. Her reputation equalled that of Fanny Burney (Madame d'Arblay) (1752–1840) earlier, in a time that saw a number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>women</b> writers including Elizabeth Hamilton, Amelia Opie, Hannah More, Elizabeth Inchbald. Her only potential male competitor prior to Scott was William Godwin. She was certainly well received by the critics and literary figures of her time. Croker (1780–1857) compared her work to Don Quixote and Gil Blas and {{to the work of}} Henry Fielding, while Francis Jeffrey (1773–1850) called her work 'perfect'.|$|E
25|$|Generally, Addams {{was close}} to a wide set <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>women</b> and {{was very good at}} {{eliciting}} their involvement from different classes in Hull House's programs. Nevertheless, throughout her life Addams did have significant romantic relationships with a few of these women, including Mary Rozet Smith and Ellen Starr. Her relationships offered her the time and energy to pursue her social work while being supported emotionally and romantically. From her exclusively romantic relationships with women, she would most likely be described as a lesbian in contemporary terms, similar to many leading figures in the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom of the time.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy {{for women}} has its hardships.

Pregnant women {{have to deal with the}} pregnancy with the help <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>women</b> while the men go along their day like nothing else is happening. They are more pleased with the birth of a girl than that of a boy.

25|$|Most, {{but not all}} (see fr. Multiregional {{origin of}} modern humans), {{scientists}} in the relevant fields consider this observation robust. This common direct ancestor {{in the line of}} mother to daughter (or mitochondrial most recent common ancestor (mtMRCA)) of all extant humans has become known as Mitochondrial Eve. (Mitochondria are inherited from the mother only.) The observation that the mtMRCA is the direct matrilineal ancestor of all living humans does not mean either that she was the first anatomically modern woman, nor that no other women lived concurrently with her, nor even excluding the existence <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>women</b> being ancestors of today's people. Other women would have lived {{at the same time and}} passed nuclear genes down to living humans, but their mitochondrial lineages were lost over time. This could be due to events such as producing only male children.|$|E
25|$|Women {{participating}} in polygynous marriages share common marital problems {{with women in}} a monogamous marriage; however, there are issues uniquely related to polygyny which affects their overall life satisfaction and have severe implications for women's health. Women practicing polygyny are susceptible to sexually transmitted diseases, infertility, and mental health complications. Among the Logoli of Kenya, the fear of AIDS or becoming infected with the HIV virus has informed women's decisions about entering polygynous marriages. Some view polygyny {{as a means to}} prevent men from taking random sexual partners and potentially introducing STDs into relationships. Interviews conducted with some of the Logoli tribe in Kenya suggested they feared polygynous marriages because of what they have witnessed in the lives <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>women</b> who are currently in such relationships. The observed experiences of some of the women in polygynous unions tend to be characterized by frequent jealousy, conflicts, competition, tensions, and psychological stresses. Some of the husbands fail to share love and other resources equally; and envy and hatred, and sometimes violent physical confrontations become {{the order of the day}} among co-wives and their children. This discourages women from entering a polygynous marriage. Research shows that competition and conflict can intensify to unbearable level for co- wives causing women to commit suicide due to psychological distress. Findings show that the wife order can affect life satisfaction. According to Bove and Valeggia, women who are senior wives often misuse their position to obtain healthcare benefits in countries one wife can become a recipient. The conflict between co-wives can attribute to the higher rates of mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, and paranoia.|$|E

According to her attorney Lennox Hinds, Shakur [...] "understates the awfulness of the condition in which she was incarcerated", which included vaginal and anal searches. Hinds argues that [...] "in the history of New Jersey, no woman pretrial detainee or prisoner has ever been treated as she was, continuously confined in a men's prison, under twenty-four-hour surveillance of her most intimate functions, without intellectual sustenance, adequate medical attention, and exercise, and without the company <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>women</b> for all the years she was in custody".|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, lyric poetry was {{associated}} with male poets and quotidian poetry (i.e., the poetry of the everyday) with female poets. The division of labour in Midas reflects this trend: Percy contributed the two lyric poems in the drama while Mary's play contains the kind of detail found in the poetry <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>women.</b> However, Mary Shelley does not simply accept these gender-genre distinctions. As Richardson explains, [...] "soliloquy is resisted in the first act and exposed in the second act as a questionable and implicitly masculine mode". Furthermore, the disjunction between Percy Shelley's poems, spoken by Apollo and Pan in the first act, and Mary Shelley's verse drama has often bothered critics. Yet, Richardson argues that this was intended, to highlight the difference in poetic mode.|$|E

500|$|More {{significant}} is {{the connection between}} the women in the novel and the women in Balzac's life. Some critics have noted important similarities between Valentin's efforts to win the heart of Foedora and Balzac's infatuation with Olympe Pélissier. A scene in which Valentin hides in Foedora's bedroom to watch her undress is said to come from a similar situation wherein Balzac secretly observed Pélissier. It's probable that Pélissier was not the model for Foedora, however, since she accepted Balzac's advances and wrote him friendly letters; Foedora, by contrast, declares herself outside the reach of any interested lover. Critics agree that the [...] "Woman without a Heart" [...] described in the novel is a composite <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>women</b> Balzac knew. The character of Pauline, meanwhile, was likely influenced by another of Balzac's mistresses, Laure de Berny.|$|E
500|$|Barney's {{earliest}} {{intimate relationship}} was with Eva Palmer-Sikelianos. [...] In 1893 they became acquainted during summer vacations in Bar Harbor, Maine.

[...] As young adults in Paris they shared an apartment at 4, rue Chalgrin. Later they each had their own place in Neuilly. [...] Barney frequently solicited Palmer's help in her romantic pursuits <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>women,</b> namely Pauline Tarn. [...] Palmer ultimately left Barney's side for Greece and eventually married Angelos Sikelianos. Their relationship did not survive this turn of events, Barney took a dim view of Angelos and heated letters were exchanged.

500|$|The {{exact nature}} of Arbuthnot's {{relationship}} with Wellington {{has always been a}} subject for conjecture. Fuel was added to the speculations when Wellington was immediately pursued by female admirers following her death. One was a Miss Jenkins who, from the moment of Arbuthnot's death, pursued him [...] "body and soul." [...] Another, who resurfaced from his past, was Arbuthnot's own cousin, the eccentric Lady Georgiana Fane, who constantly pestered Wellington with threats to publish intimate letters he had once sent her, and to sue him for, allegedly, reneging on a promise to marry her. It seems most likely that in addition to assisting Wellington with his social life, Harriet's presence at his side protected him from the advances <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>women.</b> The Duke certainly kept mistresses during the period he knew Arbuthnot, but it has never been proven that Harriet was one of them. [...] The tour at Apsley House, the Duke's London residence, asserts that she merely served as his hostess at political dinners.|$|E
